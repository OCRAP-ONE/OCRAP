review/summary: Endangered Species Wolf Dark Chocolate
review/text: This is my favorite dark chocolate, but when my local stores stopped carrying it, I searched and found it from this vendor.  My order arrived super-fast and I've been enjoying this delicious dark chocolate ever since.  Would highly recommend this product and vendor, and I plan to reorder when my supply is depleted.

review/summary: One needs to develop a taste
review/text: This type of chocolate is supposed to be one of the best for its antioxidant value, but it is rather bitter.  Neither my daughter nor I could get through one bar, so I took the remainder of my 12-pack order to school to give to students to share in one on my classes.  Even among teenagers who love chocolate, however, the review was quite mixed.

review/summary: summer melt
review/text: Though I have been eating this product for a couple of years and buying it locally, I had thought that buying in bulk would be cheaper and easier.  The first time I received the package, most of the chocolate bars had melted significantly. I decided to give it a second try, and though the summer melt took fewer bars, so far every bar has shown signs of beginning the process. I'll probably not give it a third try. Unfortunately, the product is not carried by many vendors around me, so I may be looking for another treat.

It actually smells stronger than it tastes, which is nice because it was very aromatic. But drinking it, it's real mellow and settles well in your stomach. Ahhhh...

review/text: These have grown on me since I've bought them.  Pear/Peach taste/consistency with a bit of their own flavor.  They have lots of seeds, but they aren't intrusive;  like tomato seeds, they just slide right down.  They're sweeter than pears, but less sweet than peaches. Pretty good for the price, though I do prefer pears or peaches.  3.5 stars to be exact.  It's coin flip whether or not I would get these again.

review/summary: Solved My Problems
review/text: Every dog is different so results with a given food will vary, but Blue Wilderness has been great for me.<br /><br />While my dog was eating higher end foods (Science and Innova), he had recurring problems with loose stools and outright diarreah.  His gas could (and did) clear a room.  On the Blue Wilderness, he has small, firm stools and little or no gas.  He's also stopped biting at his side which he had done since I bought him.  So I'm convinced he had a gluten allergy.  I guess I could have addressed that with a rice based food, but the Blue Wilderness is so good that I'm certainly sticking with it.<br /><br />I did the transition from Innova to Blue Wilderness over a couple of months, going from 25% Blue Wilderness to 50% to 75% to 100%.<br /><br />It is pricey but because of the small amount of filler and high concentration of nutrition, I feed less--4 cups a day for an energetic, one year old, 98 lb. Doberman.<br /><br />I also did extensive online research from places that did a scientific analysis of dog foods and found the Blue Wilderness consistently got the best evaluations.  So I'm happy.  And Knucklehead is happy.

review/text: This food is great, my German Shepherds do really well on it, maintaining healthy weight and it has high levels of nutrients to support healthy joints.  That being said, this 1-800PetSupplies listing for ~$62 plus ~$15 shipping plus tax is too much. Even at PetSmart, which I'm sure has a healthy markup, it's $54 plus tax. IF you can't get it locally, ask your feed store or pet food store to order it for you.

review/summary: Putting on the Ritz !!!
review/text: Ritz crackers by Nabisco have always been one of my favorites. I remember eating them in kindergarten at snack time--I always wanted a couple extra! LOL These crackers have stood the test of time because they are very tasty and great to eat as a snack.<br /><br />Ritz crackers are rather low in fat (4.5 grams of fat per serving) and they have almost no carbohydrates. They are cholesterol free as well--hooray! In addition, this product is kosher if that matters to you. The nutrition label indicates that there are no trans-fats but I did notice a bit of partially hydrogenated ingredients on the label--it may be that the amount of trans-fats this generates is negligible.<br /><br />Ritz crackers can be eaten by themselves but feel free to get creative! They can help out when it's time to make snacks for company. Just put a bit of cheese (or melted cheese and ham) on them and you're serving up great appetizers or snack in no time! They go great with a little bit of butter on them, too.<br /><br />Overall, Ritz crackers really hit the spot when I crave a snack before bedtime. I simply take a slice of two of regular cheese and place little bits of the cheese on top of the crackers and with a small beverage it's awesome!<br /><br />I highly recommend Ritz crackers as one of the healthier crackers that will satisfy you, too. Great!

review/text: I discovered this at Whole Foods, while looking for a better-tasting natural sweetener than stevia.  After using this for one day, I threw out my box of bitter stevia.  It's delicious!  I've had it in my dark chocolate cocoa, and in tea.  I haven't baked with it yet, but I intend to.  $10 for 12 ounces seems expensive, but I've been using less than half a teaspoon to sweeten my drinks.  Very happy to have found this raw, organic, low GI, gluten-free, vegan product!

review/summary: Sweetener replacement
review/text: I've been wanting to stop using sweetener in my coffee, but haven't been able to make the plunge back to sugar.  I was watching Dr Oz and he recommended coconut sap sugar and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BCD2GO">Madhava Organic Agave Nectar - Light, 46-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)</a> so I tried both.  I actually like both of them!  I can't decide which is better.  My husband uses half sugar and half coffee - so I was hoping this would be good for him since the Agave nectar makes his coffee taste like honey with the amount he feels he has to use...this container is pretty small to keep up with his coffee habit!  It would be great if we could purchase this in larger quantities! I will purchase again.

If it is really low glycemic that is a huge advantage for all those who suffer with diabetes. I highly recommend trying this.

I was impressed that it was natural, unprocessed, low on the glycemic index, and that the make-up of it was much lower in sucrose and fructose than other alternatives. So, I thought I'll give it a whirl. So far, I've used it to make two batches of cookies. Those cookies were delicious! I haven't really tried it in anything else. It is true that it is pricey, but it might discourage me from excessively making deserts ;o)

review/text: I bought a canister of this sugar yesterday along with some of the coconut nectar. It is wonderful stuff. It has a caramelish butterscotchy flavor but it isn't at all bitter. There are two things against it--the higher price (which limits how much I use and that might be a good thing) and the fact that it is so yummy I want to eat it plain by the spoonful. I haven't mixed it with anything yet but I can't imagine it would change a flavor in an adverse way. It should only make it better.

review/summary: Nice sweetener
review/text: It has a really nice sweetness by itself and leaves no aftertaste. I got it mainly for my coffee and I like the fact that it is raw and nutritious; however, the heat of the coffee will destroy any live enzymes present.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because (1) it is rather clumped up in the container, although it does dissolve rather nicely. (2)And, although it is nicely sweet, I have to use 2 to 3 teaspoons of it in 10 oz of coffee rather than the 1 teaspoon I was using with my regular organic sugar. (3) It is rather "heavy" and somewhat cocoa tasting, although not offensive.<br /><br />I have also tried Sweetleaf stevia with the coffee but did not like it and this sweetener is much better.<br /><br />Still, I will try another palm sweetener the next time I order.....Navitas looks pretty good.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/14/2012: Although I do not care to use it with my coffee, I am going to upgrade it to 4 stars because I have found it is very good with plain, Greek yogurt, cold cereal and oatmeal...and, dissolves very well in all 3.

review/text: I'm used to using stevioside (which I buy by the kilo), and it's highly concentrated. I feel like I need a shovel of these crystals to sweeten anything.

I've started sweetening with a combination of stevia and these crystals, but why bother to add the calories of these crystals when I can get superior sweetening power from stevia without any measurable amount of calories?

review/summary: Wonderful sweetner...even great for baking
review/text: I purchased a canister of this raw coconut crystals at my local organic market.  I think it is great!  The local shop has been out for a couple weeks, and so I have come to Amazon to order some, as I can't wait until they get it back in stock.  The price was similar.<br /><br />I have been using this in my tea and coffee when I want it sweetened.  Unlike some reviewers, I found that I need much less of this sweetner than I need of sugar.  It does not tastes as sweet, but it has a taste/flavor.  And maybe that registers with me and so I need less?  I don't know.  I am also looking to consume less sugar, and am gradually needed things to be less and less sweet as a result.  This is a good think.<br /><br />I was interested in the idea that it is lower glycemic compared to sugar, and that it has vits/minerals, is GMO-free and vegan.  My doctor thinks I may be insulin resistant, so I am looking to drastically reduce sugar consumption.  But I still love to bake and cook.  As I said, I use this in my beverages, and I have also baked with it.  I made some sprouted grain zucchini bread that was delicious.  I substituted 1/2 cup of sugar for 1/4 cup of this coconut crystals.  It was sooo yummy.  Not super sweet but full of great flavor.  I also used it as a substituion in some sprouted grain cranberry pistachio muffins that were divine.  Again, I used half of the quantity of coconut crystals compared to sugar.  Flavor was great.  I am ordering here on Amazon because I want to try it with some cookies and see how they turn out.  So far, I am loving it!<br /><br />For those that are looking for healthier alternatives, I'd say give it a try.  If you want the super sugary sweet taste, this may not be for you.

review/text: I LOVE this product.  I am really excited that I found it.  Simply put:  I am always looking for better ways to eat healthier, lower carb, and more NATURAL.  Can't take my coffee black, no matter what.  Always hated the idea of splenda, equal, etc... but used it anyway in my morning cuppa.  Just by coincidence I came across this item and ordered it...the same day it arrived my brother called and told me Dr. Oz had been talking about it on his show!  I am very happy to say that in spite of the different appearance, the taste and smell of this product is wonderful!  I put it on my 5 year olds fresh strawberries ( he always wants some sugar on them) - the crystals dissolved on the wet berries in no time - I stirred it around and gave it to him.  He loved it.  I have been fighting the "sugar battle" with him, like any kid he loves sweet stuff - and now I will be happy to let him have this on his french toast, over grapefruit - I am going to try it in my homemade hot cocoa.  HAPPY HAPPY!!  Baby steps, but they all add up towards better health.  Also told my diabetic friend about this, and she is going to order it as well.  Love all the coconut products, I have been using coconut oil in everything, with great results - next up is to try coconut flour.

review/summary: I was skeptical, but this is INCREDIBLE.
review/text: I'm extremely sensitive to sugar -- I'm not diabetic (yet) but I'm in a risk group and feel healthier when I pay attention to my sugar intake. Unfortunately, I have a powerful sweet tooth and terrible willpower, so any resolute "avoid sweets!" ideal is more cerebral than actual.<br /><br />So I decided to see if there was a sweetener I could use that wouldn't upset my blood sugar as much. I bought this and a box of stevia at the same time and thought "fine, I will experiment." The stevia is better than the equal I'd been using, but this coconut stuff? OMG is it amazing. Maybe this next admission is disgusting, but I eat it by the teaspoon. It's delicious. It doesn't make my heart race and I don't feel sick afterwards like I do with regular sweets. I'm so happy to find something that tastes awesome and is gentle on the body.

review/text: Passing time browsing through my Amazon Recommendations, I saw this offered.  I'd never heard of it, but it sounded like a healthy alternative to any form of sugar I have been using.  It just arrived about a half hour ago and I couldn't wait to open it and check it out.<br /><br />It has smaller grains than sugar or salt, and the color is a rich amber.  But the taste... O. M. G.  This, is amazing.  I am so impressed with this product.  I can foresee replacing all other types of sugar in this house in the near future.  Thank you Coconut Secret, and Thank you Amazon for recommending this product for me.  It's exceptional in so many ways.  Ok, I'll stop now...  :)

Yes, it is much closer to brown sugar as far as texture and it does have a molasses type after taste which I did'nt care for but, it was better than the chemically thing from other sweeteners. My husband found it "Not sweet enough" and felt he had to use more than he would use if it were sugar. I have to say, I used it twice when I first got it and haven't touched it since.

review/summary: Hickory Harvest Green Pea Snacks
review/text: I was guessing, when I ordered this item--no item description was provided.  From the tag, I thought these snacks might be highly processed--but they aren't.  They are shelled green peas, cooked in coconut oil, lightly salted, and dried.  I find them a bit too solid, as is, for compatibility with my own expensive dental work.  Therefore, I grind them up in a blender before adding them to instant soups, or cook them whole with stews, etc.  They contain a bit of bright green food coloring, which I find more attractive in cooked products than the (less expensive) dried green split peas commonly available in grocery stores.  I expect them to store longer if refrigerated or frozen than if left at room temperature.

review/summary: I don't know about "Dark", but it's very good
review/text: One of the big advantages of owning a K-cup brewer is the ability to make a hot beverage for just one person and make whatever they want (as long as you have it).  During the holidays hot cocoa is a favorite drink for the young people in my family as well as anyone wanting a hot and sweet drink.  Since I got my Keurig I have experimented with several different hot cocoa K-cups.  So far, the Green Mountain has been the preferred K-cup, especially by the adults (there are some sweeter ones out there that some of the children like better).  When I saw this new Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />The first thing that I noticed was that it is made by Green Mountain!  A couple of interesting notes on the box:<br /><br />* You should shake the K-cup before using<br />* They suggest using the 8 oz. cup size<br />* They recommend that you run a hot water brew cycle (without a K-cup) after brewing the Cafe Escapes<br /><br />It did taste a little richer than the regular Green Mountain Hot Cocoa but I didn't get the Dark Chocolate taste that I was hoping for.  I also like it better when I used the next smaller cup size on my Keurig B70 (about 5 1/2 oz.).  It's not as good as the Ghirardelli packets made for the Keurig but it's more convenient.  I like it better than the Gloria Jeans which tends to be a little sweeter and lighter on the chocolate taste.  There is not getting around the fact that the best hot chocolate drink is the one that you make yourself with milk, cocoa and sugar, but this is still very good and I will buy it again.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JVCI96">Ghirardelli Premium Double Chocolate Hot Cocoa 20ct</a>

review/summary: Sugar and Sucralose
review/text: I bought this after reading high reviews in various places about how this is supposed to be one of the best hot cocoas.  It does a better job of getting the flavor of cocoa out than others have but the improvements are ruined by the inclusion of sucralose.  It provides that off putting after taste to the whole thing.  If you don't mind the taste of sucralose/splenda then this is probably pretty good for you.  I just really wish they'd just used sugar for the whole thing.  Oh well, back to cocoa packets for now.

review/text: New to the world of Keurig, I bought these K-cups in a large package for my husband and I to share.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed.  Hot chocolate K-cups are designed to quick-dissolve (compared to the regular hot chocolate packages you buy from the store) and it tastes like chemicals.  The milk chocolate is no different than the dark chocolate when it comes to chemical taste.  After playing with different water level settings, I eventually just had to throw them out.  Now we buy normal hot chocolate packets instead.

review/text: I have no idea what prior reviewers are tasting, but my wife and I love these K-Cups and would much rather have this than Swiss Miss packets.  This tastes like *cocoa* and not *chocolate* and, for that reason alone, it'd be 5-stars to me.  The sweetener level was just fine, with no bizarre aftertaste.  If they had used full-on sugar, it'd be like sucking a melted chocolate bar out of a cup - which I would hate.  In fact, this could have been even more bitter.  It reminds me of the mildly (this is key) sweetened cocoa found in Mexican grocers as "Mexican chocolate."<br /><br />For best results, you *have* to shake the K-Cup as stated on the box.  We added a splash of heavy cream when done and it was heaven.  Plus, no grainy, powdery consistency found in packet mixes.  If you have a Keurig, and you want easy-to-make hot cocoa (and the over-rich quality of Ghirardelli and the like are too much for your tastes), I recommend this product.

Also, even if it was sweetened normally, the chocolate flavor was very thin and weak.  I'd have been better off just heating the hot water with my Keurig and stirring in some Swiss Miss mix.<br /><br />Why isn't the sweetener mentioned anywhere on the box except for in tiny letters on the ingredient list??

It's way too sweet to qualify as a dark chocolate drink.The sugar with the sucalose makes it sickeningly sweet and stomach churning. It's missing the creamy quality that hot cocoa should have, kinda watery although it does have some of the thick mouth feel, just no creaminess. I think I'll stick with packets when I'm too lazy to make it from scratch.

review/summary: By Far The Best Hot Chocolate I've Ever Had!!!!!!
review/text: I am usually a milk chocolate- hot chocolate drinker, but when I saw this I had to give it a try and boy am I glad I did. There is nothing that compares to this, not even the Godiva hot chocolate. This Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa is the best HANDS DOWN!!!!! I'm a huge chocoholic, I've been eating chocolate for over 30 yrs, I'm 32.... so I think its safe to say I've had my share of hot cocoa. I've even had the aztec version you make with milk. This so much better. I just wish they had it on auto-order!!!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045IK1CK">Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa Keurig K-Cups, 16 Count</a> Mmmm, Mmmm, Goood!  (Oops wrong product!... but it fits) When it comes to chocolate of any variety I prefer the less sweet, bolder taste and mouth feel of dark chocolate.  Thus, the dark chocolate hot cocoa has quickly become my favorite.  It is rich, bold & creamy (even so I add dry creamer).  At 1 minute to heat up the brewer & 1 minute to brew a fantastic cup of hot cocoa, you can't beat it.  A tip: stir your cup of cocoa occasionally while you drink it as some of the chocolate tends to settle out, and as a fellow chocoholic I'm sure you would hate to see any of that chocolate go to waste.

review/text: I was really excited to try this, thinking it was actually going to taste like a dark chocolate hot drink. I was sorely disappointed. In my opinion it was WAY too sweet and I didn't even get a hint of dark chocolate taste. To make matters worse, if you read the ingredients on the box, it's full of chemicals I can't even pronounce, as well as artificial sweetener. Save your money and keep looking.

review/text: It tastes harsh and artificial, not what is expected in hot chocolate.<br />I prefer the Green Mountain Hot Cocoa.<br /><br />Chocolate tastes aside, neither of them are perfect for K-cup as chocolate powder do not always dissolve completely inside K-cup, so there are some inconsistencies between cups. Some cups can be much weaker than others, especially if the K-cup is not shaken before use.

review/summary: Better than others I've tried
review/text: Although I do like the flavor of this hot chocolate and was excited about it being "dark chocolate" (my favorite!), I only gave this a 3 star review. It tastes good, especially with a bit of added cream. My one complaint though is it seems to give me a slight aftertaste, which I do not like. So far, however, this is the best k-cup hot chocolate I've found. Hoping more will come out to try, because none of them I've tried so far are THAT good, this one is the best though. At least it does taste like hot chocolate, the others taste like brown SLIGHTLY chocolate flavored water. Suggestion: Make the smallest cup setting or the hot chocolate will be too weak. Add a tish of cream and/or whipped cream on top and stir as it's brewing...makes it taste good!

review/text: There's not even an argument here.  I've eaten pretty much every organic dark chocolate bar on the market.  Even some of those insanely priced Raw Food ones, at $9 per bar.  This is FAR AND AWAY the best tasting, best quality bar I've eaten.  It's so amazingly delicious, and makes me feel good too.<br /><br />The price listed on here isn't that great, however.  I get these in Stop N' Shop (NY Grocery Store Chain) for 2 for $5.  A pack of 12 would be $30 and I don't have to pay for shipping, so I end up getting a better deal.  Amazon usually has the best deals ever, but not so for these chocolate bars.  Even though I'm not buying them on here, I'm still buying them regularly!<br /><br />Amazing chocolate.  Do yourself a favor and buy CASES of these if you can't find them in any store around you!

review/text: Endangered Species Chimpanzee Dark Chocolate is smooth and rich without being overly bitter or too sweet. It is also comforting to know that when you buy this chocolate animals are being helped. I like this chocolate as much as the "Bat" dark chocolate. This chocolate is just right and I will definitely buy it again and again. If you really want a great experience eat dark chocolate while sipping on a cup of coffee or tea. The warmer your mouth the better the experience. I'd avoid drinking something cold while eating chocolate.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Great chocolate, easily the best retail packaged bars I have ever had, and a close second to specialty chocolate from dedicated chocolate shops, both in taste and social responsibility. My only gripes are not being certified organic and at the moment not being available with super-saver shipping.<br /><br />Normally I only write reviews in special cases, such as when customers need to be aware of a problem not disclosed on the product page, false advertising or, as in this case, other reviews misrepresent the product. This is mostly in response the 1-star bad humor review claiming the lack of actual "chimp flavor" as false advertising, which I reported as abuse for blatantly misrepresenting the product after the author claimed it was not an attempt at humor.

review/text: I bought this expecting to be able to enjoy the savory flavor of man's closest living genetic relative, the chimpanzee.  When I tasted this chocolate bar, all I could taste is dark chocolate.  Now, had this been marketed as just a dark chocolate bar, then I would have given it a four or five star rating, as JUST chocolate it's fine and quite tasty.  But look at the label, there is quite clearly a chipmanzee on the label.  Where is the chimp flavor?  Had I wanted just chocolate flavor I would have bought such.  Please stop such false advertising and put at least extract from the flesh of a chimpanzee into this chocolate bar.

In fact, I'm about to open my last can, so I will be ordering more shortly.<br /><br />For those with health concerns - This confection is not excessively sweet, and it's a pretty decent source of protein. The only caveat is that folks who may have nut allergies. Halvah is made from nuts! So... If you have an allergy to sunflower or sesame, stay away. For everyone else - It's an exotic dessert that isn't loaded with cream or sugar. Enjoy. :-)
