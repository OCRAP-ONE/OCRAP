review/summary: Love the taste and effects!
review/text: I realize that the taste won't be for everyone, but I certainly have learned to love this drink, not only for it's flavor, but for it's nice ongoing stimulant effect.  It does have a heavy ginger taste in the beginning that ends refreshingly. Cold is the best way to drink this one.  The effect difference between this one and other more well know energy drinks is that this tends to give an extended, more even "energy" result with less of a crash at the end.  Some very unique herbals are mixed in here such as Goji, Acai, Camu Camu and Jiaogulan. Other well known additives are Ginger, Green Tea, Ginseng, L-Theanine and B Vitamins.<br /><br />My new favorite!

review/summary: Safe energy
review/text: We (I work at a small grocery store) ordered this item at the suggestion of a customer. When I got around to trying one, WOW! The drink is sweet, but not overly so, and quite ginger-y. I love the taste of ginger. As far as the kick goes, I think it's perfect. Enough to get you going, but not so much that you won't be able to sleep.<br /><br />I have Raynaud's Syndrome. Basically, my hands are always cold. When they become very cold, they hurt pretty badly and turn blue. Temperature and stress are the main bullies to trigger these attacks. Caffeine is not good for me either, as it constricts your blood vessels. For some reason, I can drink this stuff without any bad side effects. This fact and the taste are why I continue to drink Reed's Energy Elixir.

review/text: I purchased Monin's Violet syrup last winter, when I wanted to make classic cocktails and Creme de Violette liqueur was not yet widely available. It made a delicious, if slightly too-sweet Aviation cocktail. Now that Eric Seed (of Haus Alpenz) has gotten real classic liqueurs back into stores, I prefer the more authentic ingredients. That doesn't mean the Monin Violet has lost favor in my kitchen -- when I make a Violette fizz, I often substitute Monin for plain simple syrup for extra violet kick.<br /><br />This syrup makes wonderful soda and lemonade. It really pleased my teetotaler guests.<br /><br />If you're shopping for violet flavoring for baking, candy-making or flavoring ice cream, you should search for extract or concentrate. This product isn't designed for concentrated use. (If you DO get violet extract, you can make your own violet syrup. 1 part sugar, 1 part water. Heat over a low flame until the sugar is just dissolved, and you have simple syrup. Once the simple has cooled, you can add your favorite extract drop by drop until you're satisfied with the flavor.)

review/text: This syrup is very, very sweet, and it does not have a very strong violet flavor.  I was hoping to use it to flavor ice creams and yogurts, but it does not have enough violet flavor to work in this way.  I've tried just adding more of it to increase the flavor, but then the sweet taste becomes too strong.  If you are looking for a sweetener with a hint of flavor, this will be great for you, but if you are trying to make violet flavored treats such as are available in Europe, you will be disappointed with this syrup.

It is no overpowering, has a very light tingle of spice (probably the ginger) followed by a cool, minty sensation all the way down your throat.

It is amazing how much this tea can help you if you suffer from stress and anxiety.  I drink it in the morning and at night, I find that it really makes the day run a lot smoother for me and I have been referring to this tea as "medicine" since it relieves some anxiety without all the side effects of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, addiction(I am addicted, but it's not a drug!

I'd recommend it to the worry-warts, and the people that have small panic attacks from time to time.  It surely helps, and the best part is that it tastes delicious!

review/summary: Closest thing to 70s Girl Scout Fudge Patties I've found yet--Keebler Fudge Filled Cookies
review/text: For anyone who remembers those fudgy little cookies and has been missing them, this is a good news/bad news story.  The bad news--the crisp cookie part of this treat is a chocolate one, unlike the plain vanilla of Fudge Patties past.  The good news--you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />For the uninitiated:  this is a lighter, more crisp version of a vanilla wafer (though chocolate), slightly hollowed out to accommodate a dollop of creamy fudge.  The whole thing is then covered in more chocolate.<br /><br />This is no gourmet cookie; but for chocolate lovers who've never forgotten the joy of biting into that thick, creamy fudge layer before  finding the crunchy cookie inside, it's not bad.<br /><br />Serving suggestion:  Best eaten at warm-ish room temp, when the outer blanket of chocolate is just soft enough to be a bit tacky but not messy, allowing your teeth to sink into the inner fudgy layer...with a glass of milk nearby.

review/text: I got this product too add extra flavor to coffee without having ground cinnamon floating on top.  I tried several other extracts, and this is by far the best, with excellent aromatics and the "heat" of the cinnamon coming across well.  The only downside is that it does not bring the more savory taste of ground cinnamon with it.  I do not think that this is a shortcoming of the product; rather the savory compounds simply are not alcohol soluble, this would probably require some sort of oil base instead.<br /><br />The mouth of the bottle does not pour particularly well, and tends to dribble.  I would recommend using a measuring eyedropper to dispense it.  I ended up using one marked for children's medicine, it fits in the bottle and works well.

review/text: I purchased this beautiful waiters corkscrew a few years ago. I used it perhaps once a month. It fell apart, the metal strip in between the two pieces of olive wood broke.  I contacted Laguiole directly, I no longer had the receipt. Their very curt reply was that the only warranty was through wherever I had purchased it. They would not even allow me to ship it to them to look at.  I have purchased many things in my life, and when something breaks after a month or two, it has always been the manufacturer I have had to deal with.<br />With a company manufacturing and selling such supposed quality items as these, they should work with customers that have had one fall apart. I was told they would not accept it if I mailed it to them. They claim to have a lifetime warranty, but won't accept me sending them back a broken item? Fine, there are other top quality manufactures I will use for top quality corkscrews, cutlery and other such items. I'm done with Laguiole, its not acceptable at this price.

review/summary: Hard to find in wherehouse clubs
review/text: I never thought I'd be getting spices and such from amazon.com.  However, none of our wherehouse clubs carried freeze dried chopped chives anymore.  The supermarkets were selling the chives for hundreds of dollars a pound.  I thought there was a worldwide chive shortage.  Anyway, amazon to the rescue.  The taste is fine and the price is excellent.  Plus, with my amazon prime free shipping, I had to look no further.

review/summary: Unbeatable value but slightly lesser quality than McCormick's
review/text: I can't get over how expensive and elusive freeze dried chive is to find and have searched far and wide in the wholesale clubs looking for a larger container than the standard .16 oz offered in the grocery store for McCormick's freeze dried chive at $3.99 or higher.  Sour cream and chive is almost a staple in my husband's diet and he goes through it like water so I gave this a try.  I have to say that the McCormick's does have a stronger taste and the chive is younger and better preserved, but comparing prices, The Traders Choice gives you a full ounce to .16 for about the same price so the value can't be beat and you can afford to use a little more to get the desired taste.

review/summary: Only value: garnish
review/text: Very disappointed with this product. I started using freeze dried chives bought from Super Target stores (Archer Farms brand). Thought I'd save some money and buy in bulk from Amazon. This Traders Choice product has neither chive aroma nor taste. Rather surprised no one else has complained. Suitable only for garnish, in my opinion.

review/text: I've been having a hard time finding dried chives locally, especially at a reasonable price. So when I saw this deal on Amazon, I was very happy. The price is excellent for 3 containers ths size. I gave one to my son and one to my daughter as we all love chives in our salads and for cooking certain dishes. I think we'll be all set for some time to come!

review/summary: Pretty Darn Good!
review/text: The cookie part of these isn't sweet;  tastes just like an animal cracker.  The filling tastes just like Nutella,  I think it's a great flavor combination.  There are 25 packs of a dozen cookies each in the box.  Some nutritional info from the label:  serving size- 2 cookies,  calories-140,  trans fat-0,  saturated fat- 6g.<br /><br />OK, OK,  so these are not the most nutritious snack,  but come on!  They're cookies!  An occasional indulgence isn't going to hurt anyone.<br /><br />If you think you'll like the taste combination of animal crackers and Nutella,  then buy these.  If you are worried about saturated fat,  buy some fruit instead.

review/summary: Tasty but high-fat
review/text: These cookies are very tasty, surprisingly crisp and light, and don't taste at all like comparable inexpensive packaged cookies from the US. They are made in Poland for a German company and taste a lot like many confections from Europe, where crisp wafers and balanced tasting fillings are the norm(rather than the over-sweet cream fillings common here in the US)<br /><br />Contrary to another review here, the ingredients/nutrients list states that are are 0g of trans-fats in theese cookies.  However, there's a LOT of saturated fat.  That's a concern because if you're a normal healthy adult, you could easily eat a package of these in one sitting (only 5 ounces!)...in which case you would have had about your week's worth of saturated fat in one sitting!  Since our country has a massive (literally) weight problem, that's something to be aware of.<br /><br />Hard to beat the taste for the price, but eat with care.

review/text: I got in on the cookies a few weeks ago from Bahlsen that had the chocolate filling. They are wonderful cookies and at less than $1 a pack you cannot go wrong. These things were made for a quick coffee or milk dunk. Don't let them soak as the light cookie will fall apart, but a quick dip sets them up just fine!  They come well packed and wrapped. Recommended highly!

review/summary: Love This Cookie
review/text: I LOVE this cookie.  I have been eating these since I was a little baby!  I was so sad when they were hard to find in the U.S. for a few years... but VERY excited when I saw them for sale at a grocery store a week ago!!!  As for it being "bad" for you - honestly, you don't need to eat a whole bag!  I have two and am content.  There is no point being greedy - you're only hurting yourself.<br />I think they taste better than Gnutella, and MUCH better than Hersheys  crunchy wafers.  These have a unique and fluffy taste, and whenever I am eating them, I am reminded of patisseries found overseas.  They are especially tasty out of the fridge and without filling melting on your hands.<br /><br />*Update January 25, 2008:<br />I finally bought the 25 package deal and they took a week to get to my front door (but it came along with the newly released HP#5 ).  I used to munch on these as a little kid and then they went MIA for about a decade.  The chocolate has a slightly different taste than what my taste buds are used to now but that's because they're not American, they're German cookies... obviously they're a bit different!!  And as for nutritious value... come on now, they are cookies not fruit.  All in all, I am very happy with them and will probably buy them again - you can't beat the $.40/packet price!

review/summary: Delicious Treat--Hey, It's Not a Diet Food!
review/text: There's little question that these cookies have the crumbly pastry-like taste associated with European biscuits in general, they're flaky good like a buttery crust, although not quite as rich and moist as Vienna's finest. The insides is moister; howver, replete with creamy soft chocolate flvor, almost pudding-like in consistency. However, your Honor, since there's a nutritional debate among these reviews, I'd like to enter into evidence the incontrovertible the facts right off this 5.3 ounce package OF "HITs" that I hold in my hand.<br /><br /> Exhibit A.<br /><br />The following shows the amount and percent of the recommended daily allowance (rda) of one serving - that's two HIT cookies, or 27 grams--based on a 2,000 calorie/day diet.In one serving (two cookies (27 grams):<br /><br />Calories per serving: 140, total fat =7 grams (11%), Saturated fat=6 grams (29%), Cholesterol, 0 grams; sodium, 75 mg (3%); and 17 grams (6%) of carbohydrates, including 1 gram (3%) of  dietary fiber and 9 grams of sugar--and two grams of protein. You also get 2%  of the RDA of Calcium, and 4% of iron.<br /><br />Exhibit B:<br /><br />Compare this to "one serving" or two (28 grams) cookies of wheat-free/dairy free, mostly organic Newman O's (a somewhat healthier version of the classic OREO): Total fat (4.5 grams), Saturated fat (1.5 g). Trans fat (0 g), calories (130), sugar (10.0 grams), Total Carbohydrates, (31.5g), dietary fiber (1 g), protein (2 g), sodium (85 mg), no cholesterol, iron (8%).<br /><br />Nutritional conclusion (As always, consult  your physician!):<br /><br />Newman's beats the pants off HIT  in total fat, saturated fat (HIT has 4 times as much), twice as much of the RDA of iron but has over twice as many carbohydrates, and minimally more sugar and sodium.<br /><br />Style points:<br /><br />I can see Audrey Hepburn eating a HIT bar (without the bright wrapper) or something like it, served on a silver platter, with Italian coffee or perhaps some tea.  I cannot see her, unless she's slumming it in "Roman Holiday" eating an Oreo, even one owned by an actor as great as Paul Newman. HIT cookies--loved by kids, suitable for the adult.<br /><br /> Offered here at a great price; moveover, Amazon.com ships this free on eligible orders of $25 or more.

review/summary: Best cookies I've tried in awhile!
review/text: I was at a friend's housewarming party and she served these cookies (okay, after I made her sister ask her what was for dessert she begrudgingly handed them over) - I was hooked after the first one!  I can see why she didn't want to part with them - the cookie part has a light chocolate-y cocoa flavor that isn't too intense and the filling is just the right consistency (not lard-y like Oreos).  I originally bought the 25-pack thinking that I would share with people at work, but now that I have them I think they may be all for me.  I'm giving them 4 stars because I just know that I'm going to end up eating all of them.  You might think that this would be a defect in me, but I choose to blame the cookies.  That's how I roll.

review/text: I buy a case of these or the cocoa variety whenever Amazon features them on the Friday Sale -- generally about six dollars less than the listed $22.00.  The 5 ounce packages are paper reinforced cylinders, easy to pack and easy to open, great for a take-along treat.  (The packs don't re-close, however, so you pretty much have to devour all contents once opened.)  For Christmas I made up small gift baskets using these, a coffee mug or two, and some instant cappucino.

review/summary: Didn't particularly like these...
review/text: My family didn't really care for these cookies.  If you haven't previously eaten European cookies, you may no like these.  I have to also admit that after I made the purchase, I started to look at some of the previous reviews and I was appalled at how much calories and fat these cookies have.  Granted, they're cookies for Heaven sakes (not health food), but don't be fooled into thinking that since you may find them a bit bland that they probably have less of the "bad stuff" in them.......Not so!<br /><br />Long and the short, if you've never tried these cookies before, I would strongly recommend that you sample a sleeve (if you can find them) in your grocery store so you don't get stuck with a case that may not be eaten if your family doesn't like them.

review/summary: My Favorite Cookie
review/text: I buy these cookies in my local Polish grocery store whenever they're available.  I read some of the negative reviews for fun, and all I can say is these are from Europe - where they eat more butter, drink more, smoke and live longer than we do in the US.  If you like the icing on cakes or Oreo cookies you probably won't like these.  They're sweet, but in the European sense of the word. That means you'll actually taste something besides eye-watering sweetness.  I love these cookies with a good LaVazza coffee in the morning. Or afternoon.

The biscuit is mild chocolate and the cream is not a thick tasteless glob; it's a really delicious vanilla cream filling.  I highly recomment these in either variety -- chocolate biscuit with vanilla filling, or vanilla biscuit with chocolate filling.  My family love them.

There's a reason I got them for as little as I did. They're from 2003. I bought them in 2006. That's not something I expected from Amazon. And a lot of the cookies came broken from rough handling. So I knocked off a star. Still tasted great. And I'm still alive.

review/summary: HIT Cookies are a Hit
review/text: First of all, these are COOKIES people. You aren't supposed to eat them with no abandon. Like everything, moderation is key, and then it's fine to eat these. Obviously if you sit there and eat a whole package every day for a week, that isn't very healthy.<br /><br />Secondly, if you are expecting American style cookies, then you will be disappointed. These are not the same in the least. These are made with what they call Biscuits in Europe. They are *slightly* sweetened, almost cracker like in texture. The frosting is not made out of crisco and sugar like American cookies are, so it's not all oily and disgusting. But it also tastes VERY different. The cocoa is not super strong, but it's a nice compliment to the biscuit portion.<br /><br />If you're used to sickening sweet cookies, then you'll probably think these taste weird.<br /><br />Personally I love these because they are more subtle in flavor and not so sweet it makes my teeth hurt. They're really good with tea.

review/text: First, I have to admit these cookies are very tasty.  It's like an indulgence.  But at 140 calories for 2 cookies, I have to watch how much I eat.  There are probably around 12 cookies in 1 pack.  These cookies are a bit too sweet for me but I'm the type of person that doesn't eat too much sweets.  The chocolately cocoa crackers are very crunchy, not too hard, not too soft and the filling is like a marshmallow texture but it's not marshmallow, it's a creamy vanilla filling.  It doesn't ooze out when you take a bite into it. (That's a plus for me because it keeps my hands clean.)  Overall, very good.  They should make them in low-cal and low-fat versions. :)

Placing "Nutella" between two yummy-by-themselves wafers is how I would describe these delightful "HIT" sandwich cookies by BAHLSON.  I don't think that Bahlson makes Nutella....but the filling of these cookies has a similar taste.  SO scrumptious!  If they had a little more filling, I think I'd find them even better...but the taste of these cookies is super-good, even so!<br /><br />It's been over 5 years since I've seen these cookies anywhere, (I guess I jsut forgot to look?)....but I still remember the taste of them with undiminished delight!

review/text: Reeived the box of 25 cookies the week of Aug 24 2009. What a refreshing change from the too-sweet taste of American cookies!  The cookie part reminds you of lightly sweet butter cookies, the chocolate filling reminds me of a very good chocolate layer you would get from your friend who cooks the best cakes!  Not too sweet, definitely not too unsweet, it's JUST right!  You Oreo types should stay away, you won't like them. For the more discerning cookie lover.  They're addictive, before you know it, 4-5 are gobbled up.  They're very fragile, though.  Quite a few of my packages had broken cookies in them, as if they had been tossed roughly during transport.  Amazon needs to really package ALL of their items more carefully, esp. these.

review/summary: SO YUMMY
review/text: I once lived in Europe, and I got hooked on these cookies.  They are so delightful with a chocolatey middle with crumbley outer cookies.  My husband had never tried them, so we sprung for a box of 25.  I honestly think we will continue to order to always have the addictive cookies around!

review/summary: Delicious! Flakey Cookie with creamy center
review/text: These are really tasty.  They  are not very sweet but the cookie wafers are crispy and delicately buttery flavored.  Personally, I do not think they taste anything at all like a Ritz cracker with no salt.  And I liked the cocoa cream center very much -- again not real sweet but really chocolately tasting.  The cookies are a nice size, too. I was leery of buying 24 packs here on Amazon based on a couple of the reviews but I did find it locally so I bought a test package.  The price was about 50% more than the Amazon price though. I liked them very much and NOW I will definitely order the case from Amazon so I can keep them on hand.

review/summary: my favorite cookie, but what's with the price?
review/text: I don't usually care for sweets, but I really enjoy this cookie, especially the chocolate filling version.  The wafers aren't overly sweet and have a filling like Nutella.  What I don't understand is the price.  These are available in my local grocery store for $1.19 per package.  Same size, same brand.  And please don't think that I must live in some metropolis of cool where all foodstuffs are available at all times.  I live in West Virginia.  And I don't even have to go to a specialty store for these.  They're in the regular supermarket in one of the most backwards states in the nation.  If I thought Amazon wouldn't kick me out, I'd offer to start my own Hits shipping business.  But of course Amazon would kick me out, so I won't.  I'm an avid Amazon shopper, but this is just silly.

review/summary: Cheap Cookies
review/text: These are decent cookies when bought at a discount from Amazon. They're light and not too sweet, but unfortunately are pretty crumbly. While it's nice that Bahlsen doesn't use trans fat, the hydrogenated filling has the cheap and greasy consistency of Crisco, and is loaded with saturated fat. Palm oil would make these a little healthier, butter would make them taste much better, but alas manufacturers must always use the cheapest ingredients possible. Since Bahlsen's price is much more reasonable than other manufacturers, and since they are superior to most brands (except the crumbs!), they are worth considering.<br /><br />The reviewers who claim these have a hazelnut filling have sensitive palates. While these cookies may or may not contain traces of hazelnuts, their filling tastes mundanely of cocoa.

review/text: These were too much to resist because not only were they on sale, but Amazon had an online coupon for them, making them only 40 cents a package, with super saver shipping included.  Even more amazingly, I ordered them yesterday, December 19, and they arrived today!  I just opened a package to try them, and they are very fresh and tasty.  They will go well on an afternoon with a cup of tea or coffee.  Do yourself a favor and don't look at the package ingredients, and just have a couple a day for a treat.  Since Amazon was so speedy, I can also use them as stocking stuffers in my Christmas bags.

review/text: Let's face it: Americans are fat. Europeans tend not to be. Plus they live longer, more fulfilling lives. So who cares about hydrogenated oils (as in palm kernel and coconut)? Seriously, people. Go outside for a change and get off your computer, get some exercise, and stop being stressed out over the little things in life, such as banning so-called "deadly" oils. Some oils make things taste better, as the case with these fine cookies  :)

review/text: I had wondered how HIT removed the trans fat from their cookies.  While hoping that they would have replaced the "bad fat" with a poly or mono unsaturated fat they have chosen to go with palm and coconut oil, two of the  nutritionally worst "vegetable oils", to make matters worse they fully hydrogenate these oils making the ratio of fat that is found in the cookies 86% saturated (6gm/7gm)!<br /><br />Nutritionally one could do better by picking almost any other cookie - so I'd recommend skipping this one.

review/text: The original Hit cookies had an almost-nutella creme center sandwiched by crispy cookies. This is sort of the reverse. The chocolate cookies taste a lot like the plain cookies but does lend a bit of chocolatey-ness to the overall flavor. The creme center is an average white creme filling like you would find in an Oreo.<br /><br />Basically, this is the less-subtle cousin to the nuanced original. It's much sweeter. But I have to ask, why not just eat an oreo?

review/summary: The world's best cold remedy.
review/text: The product description calls the Orangettes "Belgian Vitamin C."  Except for the luxury price, I'm sure Belgians must be pretty healthy with these around.  They're amazing!  The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular, but Leonidas does it very well.  The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet).  Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion.  The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying.<br /><br />I don't know if these guys are really going to improve your health, but they will definitely improve your day.  In my opinion, they're worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one-time try.<br /><br />The packaging is a gold box, wrapped in blue and white Leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box.  For shipping, the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell.  Mine arrived within three days and looked like I'd purchased them at the store to give as a gift.

review/text: If you crave dark chocolate with orange like I do, this is a superlative indulgence, Leonida's Belgian Chocolates, Dark Chocolate Covered Orange Peel. It is the kind of treat you have to horde in a secret refrigerator away from people who get the munchies and will eat any old thing. This is *special*. This feels very French. I was enjoying it so much one day at work that I missed a very important moment. My boss was leaving, soon to be deployed. He said, "Well, see you around." I was in chocolate oblivion. I didn't know that was The Moment to wrap up four years of working together. I watched him in disbelief as he waved his hand. I couldn't cry out, "Wait!" because my mouth was full of Leonida's Dark Chocolate Covered Orange Peel and you cannot talk, chat, email, or read a book, sharing/wasting this gastronomic experience with any mundane task. As I said, that was a big moment lost, but that chocolate was incredible, fulfilling, remarkable!

And since the package includes a full pound I believe that justifies the price.<br /><br />I ordered this during the winter so I was not concerned about melting.

If you go to the Roland website, [...] or look on the actual bottle you'll see the sodium content is only 125mg per serving and sugar is 1gram per serving...about the same as Huy Fong.  It is NOT 2500mg of sodium and 18 grams of sugar per serving (which is 1 teaspoon) as suggested by a few reviewers and one obviously incorrect website.  Even a teaspoon of pure table sugar only contains 4 grams of sugar!  Check your facts before posting.<br /><br />Anyway, this sauce is okay.  It's been growing on me as I get through the bottle.  Still not as good as Huy Fong which is tangier and doesn't have such a garlic taste to it.

I recently tried the Roland brand and although it tastes different, I really liked it.  So, I got a few "chili-heads" together and did a double blind test between the two, asking the taster which they like the best.  The Roland won, 3-4.  However, when we read the nutritional label and saw how much salt it had in it 2 of my friends said that they wouldn't buy it for that reason alone.  My other friend and I said, "Good, that leaves more for us!"<br /><br />I find the flavor to be delightful and I will be buying this brand from now on.

review/text: Don't buy this brand. Buy Huy Fong. It has a small portion of the sugar and sodium that Roland has. There's no way you're only going to eat one tsp of this. If you have 2 you're going to get more than an entire day's worth of sugar. Do yourself a favor and buy the real thing.

review/summary: Not as good as "original" Huy Fong Sriracha
review/text: I decided to try this sriracha out because I have been a fan of the Huy Fong (rooster) version for years. My initial impression was just "eh". I don't think its anywhere near as flavorful as the other version. There is a bit of heat to it, but its not a flavorful kind of heat. The other reviewers have talked about the sodium content and I was quite shocked. Both versions have the same serving size (1 tsp) and while the Huy Fong version has 100 mg per serving (4% of daily allowance) the Roland version has 2500 mg per serving (84% of daily allowance) so steer clear if you have high blood pressure. On another nutritional note, The Huy Fong version has 5 cal/tsp while the Roland version has 100 cal/tsp, so definitely not low calorie...<br /><br />Overall, if you had to choose between the two, I would definitely go for the original sriracha made by Huy Fong foods. It has more flavor and is much healthier for you!

review/summary: NOT MEGA
review/text: THESES SO CALLED MEGA SIZE SMARTIES ARE THE SAME AS THE GIANT SIZE AND THE GIANT SIZE SELLS FOR LESS. I HAVE HAD SMARTIES WAY LARGER THAN THIS. DISAPPOINTED, DON'T BE FOOLED BUT THEY DO TASTE GREAT. THE MEGA IS IN THE LENGTH OF THE ROLL NOT THE SIZE OF THE CANDY, THE CANDY IS LARGE

review/summary: Yum.
review/text: Kix cereal is absolutely delicious. Here, you are getting 6 boxes of it. I imagine that after consuming 6 boxes of Kix, they may not seem quite as scrumptious, so maybe it would be wise to give a box or two away so you do not get burned out on eating them.<br /><br />Recommended accessories:<br /><br />-Bowl<br /><br />-Milk<br /><br />-Spoon

review/summary: This Is The Great Salada Black Tea!
review/text: The photo and tea description are correct, the item title as of this writing, is not. This is the great Black Salada Tea. I have looked all over for this Salada Tea. Salada green teas can be found many places, in stores and online, but the black tea is hard to find. This is a quality black tea you can drink all day, everyday -not bitter. The tags are great fun to read, one of them even changed my life. Great tea, nice price, excellent service and shipping, backed by Amazon. What else could you ask for?

review/summary: Nutty Bars are tasty!
review/text: I've had these off and on as a kid, and they are pretty good! I really like them, if you're not a wafer person, do not buy these, it's not anything like a sweet cookie, and yes, you can taste the peanut butter more than anything, but I like them! I wouldn't mind eating some right now!

review/summary: Decent but lacking.
review/text: They are a good snack every once in a while but the peanut butter taste is a little overpowering to the otherwise light amount of wafer and chocolate. It could use a little something else... Like caramel!

review/summary: Have to Hide These
review/text: I bought these recently as a Friday special for a great price.  These came quickly and I have one bag open and the others hidden so I don't eat them all.  These are huge bags and the candy is nice and fresh.  Wish the peanut butter ones would come in bags like these and sold thru Amazon, not another seller who charges shipping.  Thanks for the good sale on these.
