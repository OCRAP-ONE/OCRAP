review/summary: Smooth taste, without the jitters - for Flavia owners only
review/text: A couple of years ago, my friends showed us the Flavia machine and then gave me a taste of how good a cup of coffee it could make. We immediately went out and bought one and have enjoyed using it ever since. While I have tried all of their different blends, we have settled on the House Blend as our daily brew. My wife can only drink de-caf and I find that the difference in taste between regular and the "un-leaded" is beyond my meager taste buds ability to tell the difference.  Especially since I usually put in sweetener and milk.<br /><br />The taste is smooth but with a good body. The blend has a good just-brewed coffee aroma but can be sharp and intense if you stand close by the machine as it steams out a cup. I have not tried to drink it black but I have sipped it with just half & half and it's quite nice.<br /><br />If you have a Flavia machine and want to cut down on the caffeine you drink, you will be pleased with the decaf house blend.<br /><br />4 and not 5 stars because I don't love the sharp aroma at brew time.

review/summary: Disappointed!
review/text: After reading such positive reviews on this cereal, Special K Cereal, Vanilla Almond 17.5 oz, I purchased it at my grocery store, which it is called Value Size, not Family Size, but it is the same size, and the same cereal.<br /><br />I thought maybe it would be my new favorite cereal.  Boy was I wrong!!<br /><br />First of all it is sickenly sweet, beyond belief!!  In one serving there was ONE slivered almond!!  I didn't taste vanilla at all!<br /><br />One bowl was enough.  Now Iam sorry that I purchased this larger size thinking I wanted enough to last me awhile.  Now my thinking is that I just have a larger box of this cereal to give away, and at $4.79 for this box of cereal I think I definitely wasted my money!<br /><br />I think I will go back to Special K Red Berries with I did like, and have purchased quite alot of it in the past.<br /><br />I would expect more from the Special K Brand. I like to try new things, including cereal, but not this one!!

review/summary: More jar than mushroom!
review/text: This is described as a "1-Pound jar of mushrooms". Well opening the packaging I was surprised to see that the jar was half full. One huge jar literally half full of very small slices of very dark, very dusty mushrooms. I use dried mushrooms a few times a week and have bought them from many different sources, including from a street seller in China. I have bought dried mushrooms from other sellers on Amazon but I will never ever buy these from this seller again. "Ultra AAA"? I don't think so!<br />(I took a picture, but am unable to attach it. A pity.)

These mushrooms had a very dark brown color unlike porcini. the taste was o.k.,not that of porcini.At the least I would say that the seller does not know his mushrooms, or he thinks that the buying public are completely ignorant. I would venture to say that mushrooms are Sillius Leutus not Porcini ( Boletus Edulis).

review/text: So happy to find this online. It's my favorite Chinese chili sauce. It's not really chili oil, but chili flakes with smattering of peanuts in oil, but has a wonderful flavor. The bottle I received from Amazon was even drier than usual (less oil), but that didn't affect the flavor so I will continue getting it here. Over the years I have used this product the amount of oil varies, but the flavor (which is the important part for me) is always the same.

review/summary: no after-taste, great tasting stevia product
review/text: I really love this liquid stevia.  It is sweet, not bitter and has absolutely no after-taste.  Exactly what you want in stevia.  I've been using stevia as a sweetener in my drinks and cooking for the past few years now.  I couldn't dream of going back to sugar at this point.  I've tried a number of different brands and this one is one of my top choices hands down.  I also like to keep a powder around for cooking purposes.  Tried many powder brands as well, in terms of taste and price, this brand is the best I've found; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QRU5ZQ">100 Grams (3.5 Oz) Stevia 95% Steviosides Bulk Powder</a>.  Come to my home and you'll find both products in my cupboard.  Highly Recommended!

review/summary: great in coffee or tea
review/text: This compact little bottle carries the power to sweeten a lot of coffee and tea drinks.  I began using this product when I developed gestational diabetes.  The stevia did not move my blood sugar at all and gave me something I could add to my beverages besides sugar.  It is highly concentrated, I personally use half a dropperful per cup.  Due to its size, it is easy to carry around in a purse or bag.  This tastes far better than any of the artificial sweeteners out there.  It is really good in peach flavored ice tea.<br />Since I am now at increased risk for developing type two diabetes, I continue to watch my carbs, and to use this product.  I also have several friends who are diabetic or have other carb-aggravated disorders, and I like being able to share the little bottle I carry with me with my friends when we are out.<br />There are a few things to be aware of with this product. It is super concentrated, so experiment with drops at first until you figure out how much you like.  Too much and it becomes bitter.  I also am not aware of how to use it to replace sugar in baking.  It seems like the liquid form would change a recipe too much to really make this the best option for baking.  As long as your using this to add to something the way you might add spoonfuls of sugar, it is great!

I have been using stevia for years and this product is not very good (you have to use twice as much for it to 'sweeten' what you're putting it in).

review/text: I am changing my sugar loving ways and losing weight. I usually take 3-4 teaspoons of sugar in my coffee - I only need a few drops (3-6) of this to have a great tasting cup of coffee with no bitterness like some stevia products have.<br /><br />I have used about 2 ounces a month average - adding this to oatmeal, coffee, and non-fat greek yogurt everyday.<br /><br />Couldn't be happier with the taste and quality. I was told about this by my daughter who uses the other flavors. I personally prefer no flavor in my sweetner and I am allergic to aspartame.<br /><br />I have lost about 8 lbs in one month by adding oatmeal with golden raisins and walnuts for breakfast, and non-fat greek yogurt with vanilla extract+cinnamon+frozen fruits such as blueberries/strawberries/peaches/cherries to my diet. I have not exercised more than normal. All I have done is followed the advice in Dr's Oz/Roisen book "You on a Diet". I recommend this book as a great owners manual for your body.<br /><br />NuNaturals AF Stevia has let me keep the sweetness I crave without the calories. I'm in love.

review/summary: Best Stevia I've Tried
review/text: I've tried several brands of stevia -- I found them funny tasting.  I persisted in trying different types because of the lure of an all natural, no-calorie sweetener.  The artificial sweeteners don't agree with me.  And I never liked the idea of putting them in my body.  Nu Naturals Liquid Stevia is MUCH better than any stevia I tried before.  I use it in cold and hot foods/beverages, as the lone sweetener or sometimes with a natural sweetener like maple syrup or honey (to reduce calories).  Because I like it so much, I haven't bothered to try Nu Naturals Stevia Powder, so I can't offer a comparison.  I highly recommend this stevia product!

review/summary: Best I Have Used So Far...
review/text: I usually purchase this from my neighborhood Whole Foods Store. I saw it on here for a comparable price and was going to order something anyway and added it to my order. I started purchasing this brand because it has no alcohol base unlike a lot of the other brands that I have tried, it's more reasonably priced, it doesn't seem (at least to me) to have that bitter aftertaste as strongly as some others and a little goes a long way. I use this in everything, even baking.<br /><br />I noticed also that they sell a granulated "no bitterness" baking blend of this brand on Amazon and will have to give that a go as well. A bottle usually lasts me about 6 - 8 weeks (I drink herbal tea on a daily basis) as long as there is no holiday involved...lol.

They taste like those sugar wafer cookies I ate when I was little... Of course, these don't have near the sugar - so I guess it's more like the sugar wafer cookies with a "less sweet" but still delicious filling! :)  Peanut butter crunch and cookies and cream are both d'lish!

I like it because of the different texture than a lot of bars. Most I have tried have been sort of gummy and chewy, but this has the nice cripness of the cookie wafer. The bar tastes really good and I will buy this one again

review/summary: Great ingredients, great bar
review/text: These Creme Filled Wafer bars taste absolutely amazing!!!  They do not have any of the chalky taste of most high protein bars and it is very light and crispy, compared to any other bar on the market. I have a very busy lifestyle with work, the gym, surfing, mountain biking, etc, so bars and protein drinks are a staple.  I have tried many bars and this one is my favorite.  I used to love zone bars because they were crispy and not as "Dense" as most protein bars, but then I discovered these bars and I will never go back.  These bars are the perfect snack when you need protein fast. I take no xplode before I workout so I can't eat anything 2 hours prior to my workout. My workout are usually 1 to 2 hours long and not eating for 4 hours can really put a strain on your goals of bulking up.  I take a power crunch bar with me to the gym and eat it during my workout. Its light enough where it doesn't reduce the pump I get from the no xplode and it's just enough to get the protein you need to build muscle.

review/summary: Great for trekking while on holiday
review/text: I was lucky enough to meet the creator of Power Crunch while on holiday in the Sacred Valley in Peru. We had 2 weeks of day to day trekking in the Andes and our in-take of daily Power Crunch bars really saved the day. The terrain, the altitude and the food were challenging while being of our normal whole-food diet. I felt like Power Crunch really helped my body adjust and get a little extra out of an eXtreme vacation and tour schedule. I'm so excited by the taste and texture I'm ready to find a distributor in Asia so that Power Crunch can be part of my active daily lifestyle. You only need to try one to be hooked; do it when you need a little extra boost and you'll be back for more.

review/summary: Tasty and light
review/text: If those dense, heavy nutrition bars are too rich for you to tolerate or if you can't handle them after a hard workout, this one is worth trying.  It's very tasty and light.  The wafers give it a nice texture and crunch and it will remind you of those creme wafer cookies from childhood but much tastier and with better nutrition.  I will say that if you're looking for a "super bar" this may not be ideal because it does have a little more fat in it than other bars I like and a bit less protein and carbs, but it's worth buying because it tastes really good, it's light and easy to digest.  For me, this is a great meal replacement bar/snack or great after a light to moderate workout.

review/text: They don't fill you up.<br /><br />My plan was, for lunch, to slowly eat one of these with a large glass of water. It's what my friend does with his nutrition bars.<br /><br />However, not only are these incredibly light, small, and I mean small, we're talking 3-4 bites, maybe 5-6 half-bites. Even if you chew 1-2 minutes(nearly impossible)<br /><br />They have a kind of sandy texture. Like you've just eaten caramel dipped in sand.<br /><br />The taste is alright, but I am disappointed. Triple Chocolate and I could not taste the chocolate. It barely tasted like anything...just had a kind of bland taste to it.<br /><br />At this price...I am disappointed massively. These were top rated by so many...<br /><br />But I think I will try the bar my friend has - his are 32g's of protein, 2.5x this ones, and only 30-40 more calories. Those are filling from what I've seen, have way more to them as well. Bigger, about 30% bigger size as well. To top it off? They are the same price and often on sale...they also have Vitamins and anti-oxidants.<br /><br />These, I don't know. If you down them with a Glass of Carnation instant breakfast, it goes well, kinda a good combo, not to heavy, just right. But this + water...not filling in the least.<br /><br />These are treats for after a meal, I suppose. I was looking for meal replacers. Ect, replace a breakfast here, or a lunch there. So I don't lose any muscle, just fat.<br /><br />I would recommend them if you want something very light to have as an after-snack to a small meal<br /><br />But these are not meal replacers. These do not go by themselves, you eat these + a meal. Just make sure you know that.<br /><br />It's my fault, I suppose for not researching.

review/summary: Not The Best Option Out There...
review/text: I had high hopes for these bars... I am a huge chocolate wafer fan! I am familiar with protein/energy bars and knew going into it that there would more than likely be a hint of that chalky protein bar flavor... but it hit me like a brick wall with the first bite. Luckily my husband has tastebuds that are muted to flavor, so he has slowly been able to work through this box of protein bars so we weren't just throwing money away... but wow. Just overall very disappointing. I went by reviews before deciding to purchase these, and most reviews were awesome...  so I can only assume that these are just one of those bars that is hit and miss. Some are going to love it, others are going to hate it. Unfortunately, I am in the latter group for this one. (And as a side-note, I shouldn't even call this a protein bar since it only contains 13g protein --- my all time favorite protein bar contains 20g. Granted, 13g is still a lot... but if you can choke this down, surely you can choke down a 20g bar with more flavor. In the future I will stick with my tried and true Chocolate Mint Builder's bars.)

review/summary: Mouth watering!
review/text: Over the last 3 years I have sampled every major protein bar offering and I have to say these Power Crunch bars are my favorite.  It has a very sugary, chocolate taste that is similar to real chocolate wafer cookies. Power Crunch does not have the thick, hard protein "paste" you'll find in most bars. The chocolate wafer style is soft and almost disintegrates in your mouth - quite a contrast from most protein bar offerings. I've eaten probably a dozen a week for the last six weeks and I still cannot get enough of these bars.<br /><br />In all fairness most protein bars have 30+ grams of protein - more than double the amount than the 14 grams in Power Crunch. So personally I consider Power Crunch to be a very healthy high protein candy bar rather than protein bar. But after tasting Power Crunch, it'll be a long time before I reach for another Detour, MET-Rx, Oh Yeah, South Beach, or any other bar.

review/summary: A *true* protein bar, does NOT contain hydrogenated oils!
review/text: My wife and I love these Power Crunch bars!  They have a great protein content and are low carb, which is great for our current exercise and diet routine.  Contrary to what's listed above, it does *not* contain hydrogenated *anything.*<br /><br />However, we're a bit concerned with the Palm Oil and Palm Kernel oils, and were told by BNRG that this was the healthiest alternative for the chocolately coating on the outside and the inside filling that would remain solid at room temps.<br /><br />My suggestion to them would be to make an alternative variety that has NO chocolatey coating (much like Bisco's sugar wafers), thus limiting the amount of oils that they'd need to use in these otherwise stellar protein bars.

review/text: I have had the vanilla, triple chocolate and PB versions of the power crunch bars and those are all very good.  The cookies & cream flavor however tastes very strongly of fake sugar.  For some reason the other flavors do a better job at masking this, the C&C  does not.<br /><br />I recommend having these with a hot drink, if you drink something cold while eating them you get a weird filmy coating to the roof of your mouth.  All flavors work well at keeping hunger away for 3 hours and do not cause gastric distress like some low carb bars can.  I prefer the other flavors over the C&C, but these are fine if the other flavors are gone and I need a quick bite with my morning coffee.<br /><br />I do not crave sweets after I eat a power crunch bar; sometimes sugar substitutes make me want to eat more sugar, but these actually cut my sweet tooth off at the pass.

review/summary: Taste like a chocolate covered wafer. With STEVIA!!!
review/text: I was looking for a bar to snack on that wasn't loaded with carbs and sugar. This was it. It only has 4g of sugar in the whole bar and the rest is STEVIA. I couldn't tell at first and i wondered why it still tasted sweet so when i read the label I found the stevia. LOW LOW LOW on carbs too. I hate the gummy yucky..chewy texture of most health bars or power bars. this was a nice change and crisp. I only eat the Triple chocolate and the chocolate peanut butter. Those are the only two flavors that use STEVIA. the other flavors use sucralose and tasted waaaayyyyy too sweet.<br /><br />I bought them online here becuz at the store they were usually 3/$5. SO this was a bargain.<br /><br />Love them, Thanks. Taste even better cold out of the fridge.

review/summary: I am addicted to these
review/text: I have been controlling my weight for the last 6 months (lost 22 lbs) falling off of the horse eating cake and stuff but when I discovered these 2 weeks ago, my "sugar jones" was redirected from high glycemic snacks to these.  If you have to sin, these have 13g of protein, 5g of sugar so they won't put you in a diabetic coma. I recommend Peanut butter cream.

review/summary: Hydrolyzed protein is the best absorbed
review/text: These bars contain hydrolyzed whey protein, which is the highest quality. It doesnt matter if a bar contains 100g of protein if you dont absorb any of it. Hydrolyzation "pre digests" the protein so it absorbs more completely and quickly. These bars are the only ones that contain only hydrolyzed protein that I've found. Hydrolyzed protein also gives less gas. They taste great as well. They are very light and melt in your mouth a bit.

review/text: Power Crunch bars are perfect for me. Unlike most protein/health bars, these are very easy on the teeth, very soft, yet crunchy from the wafer cookie part. They easily melt in your mouth. The taste is great on every single flavor! The vanilla was good but boring. Peanut butter fudge and cookies and cream are VERY good!<br />I've been using protein bars to lose weight. I've lost 100 lbs now and will continue to live on these wonderfully healthy bars from Power Crunch. Yum! And the numbers on the label are great, too!

review/text: Compared to other protein bars, this one tastes the best. It is not chalky. It is easy to eat. Not too sweet like some "energy" bars. However, almost half of the calories is from fat and the protein content is lesser than other protein bars. Maybe as a snack. Definitely not a protein supplement.

review/text: These protein bars are absolutely amazing.  I could eat these all day they are so tasty.  The best thing about them is that they have a WHEY protein blend and not a SOY protein blend, which makes them a more complete protein. Would I rather be eating chicken breasts...?  Yes, but when I am on the go, these are amazing!

review/summary: Delicious, with a catch...
review/text: I love these things. Eating one of these bars is highly reminiscent of snarfing down a handful of those super-sweet wafer cookies in all their unhealthy, refined yumminess. The only problem? Despite the 14gr of protein, I find these bars utterly unsatisfying. As someone who needs to make sure every calorie counts bigtime, I can't afford to eat a protein bar that won't carry me over to the next mealtime. Unfortunately, I can (and have) devoured more than one of these at a time in a single sitting. I believe I purchased a single bar in the grocery store recently as a "treat", but I can never buy a whole box of these bars ever again. These taste great, no question (though I do detect the "protein" aftertaste), just don't get them if you shouldn't be cramming them down your throat two at a time. Unless, of course, you have more self control than I do.

And I recommend storing in freezer. :)  And i forgot the cookies n creme.... Also delicious!

review/summary: Quality Energy Bar!
review/text: I've tried these a couple times now, and first of all, they are delicious for an energy bar. Second, I've eaten them before and during workouts and I really do notice a difference in my energy level and stamina. There's no stimulants in it, as far as I can tell - and I don't feel a caffiene buzz or anything, I just notice myself motivated to keep going at times when before I definitely would have stopped. It's really fascinating! Plus, I didn't feel any gnawing hunger to consume high energy (meat, cheese, etc.) stuff at the end of the workout like usual. I'm a skeptic when it comes to different health fads and supplements and stuff, and this looked sorta like one of those that looked fancy but just were a waste of money. But after this second time of trying one right before a workout, I'm convinced this is quality stuff, and I just bought 2 dozen more!

review/summary: Guilt-free and delicious
review/text: Most protein bars are either loaded with sugar (and if you are in the market for protein bars, you probably don't want tons of simple carbs) or sugar alcohols (which are an excellent laxative! it does let manufacturers say say 'low sugar' on the packaging though), have a strange taste to them, and honestly aren't as good as a source of protein as they may appear -- most contain Soy protein.<br />They also tend to have a texture that isn't very appetizing, either really chewey or really gooey.<br /><br />The main difference with these bars is that they taste amazing. They taste what they look like - a giant chocolate wafer, have very little sugar and no sugar alcohols either. They have a pure whey protein source, no soy protein in these (I always read the packaging on protein bars and sadly soy protein is very common). Nutritionally they are not too bad at all, they are definitely great for a pre-workout treat. They are fairly high in fat, very low in carbs, and middle of the road protein (for a protein bar).  But the fact that it has 0 sugar alcohol, very low sugar, whey protein instead of soy and taste delicious really does make up for the higher fat content.<br /><br />Now it isn't really a downside but they are dry and make your mouth water a ton - make sure you have something to drink with them. But really these are my favorite protein/energy bars out there.
