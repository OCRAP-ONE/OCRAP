review/summary: Delicious and Nutritious - best tasting bars on the market
review/text: These don't taste like good for you food, but they are. My 2 year old loves them. I wanted to clarify something written in one of the other reviews -  that these bars DO NOT contain hydrogenated oil. They contained hydrolyzed whey protein (I had to check it out for myself, as I certainly want to avoid bad oils). Here is the link to the nutritional information [...]

review/summary: Delicious, with a catch...
review/text: I love these things. Eating one of these bars is highly reminiscent of snarfing down a handful of those super-sweet wafer cookies in all their unhealthy, refined yumminess. The only problem? Despite the 14gr of protein, I find these bars utterly unsatisfying. As someone who needs to make sure every calorie counts bigtime, I can't afford to eat a protein bar that won't carry me over to the next mealtime. Unfortunately, I can (and have) devoured more than one of these at a time in a single sitting. I believe I purchased a single bar in the grocery store recently as a "treat", but I can never buy a whole box of these bars ever again. These taste great, no question (though I do detect the "protein" aftertaste), just don't get them if you shouldn't be cramming them down your throat two at a time. Unless, of course, you have more self control than I do.

And I recommend storing in freezer. :)  And i forgot the cookies n creme.... Also delicious!

review/summary: Quality Energy Bar!
review/text: I've tried these a couple times now, and first of all, they are delicious for an energy bar. Second, I've eaten them before and during workouts and I really do notice a difference in my energy level and stamina. There's no stimulants in it, as far as I can tell - and I don't feel a caffiene buzz or anything, I just notice myself motivated to keep going at times when before I definitely would have stopped. It's really fascinating! Plus, I didn't feel any gnawing hunger to consume high energy (meat, cheese, etc.) stuff at the end of the workout like usual. I'm a skeptic when it comes to different health fads and supplements and stuff, and this looked sorta like one of those that looked fancy but just were a waste of money. But after this second time of trying one right before a workout, I'm convinced this is quality stuff, and I just bought 2 dozen more!

The berry flavor has a slight after taste and I wasn't a fan of the peanut butter flavor. These are great if you're watching carb intake and they make a guilt free quick snack.

review/text: I was looking for some protein bars that taste good and were soyless. These come close (soy lethicin is still listed).<br />Warning: don't order in warm climate/weather as the chocolate coating melts, even in your hands from holding it.<br />The stevia (sweetener) has a noticeable aftertaste that needs getting used to.<br />I still need to find a substitute protein bar that is good for you, not made of soy and tastes good.<br />I have to say, other than the above, these are light and crispy.

review/text: This is a great snack bar.  But don't expect normal chocolate taste.  It's different.  Not horrible, but different.  After the first bite and you kinda adjust it's fine.  I think the vanilla one is a little more of a real taste.  But the bar itself is great- I love the low sugar- definitely the best low sugar chocolate protein bar I have tasted.

review/summary: Guilt-free and delicious
review/text: Most protein bars are either loaded with sugar (and if you are in the market for protein bars, you probably don't want tons of simple carbs) or sugar alcohols (which are an excellent laxative! it does let manufacturers say say 'low sugar' on the packaging though), have a strange taste to them, and honestly aren't as good as a source of protein as they may appear -- most contain Soy protein.<br />They also tend to have a texture that isn't very appetizing, either really chewey or really gooey.<br /><br />The main difference with these bars is that they taste amazing. They taste what they look like - a giant chocolate wafer, have very little sugar and no sugar alcohols either. They have a pure whey protein source, no soy protein in these (I always read the packaging on protein bars and sadly soy protein is very common). Nutritionally they are not too bad at all, they are definitely great for a pre-workout treat. They are fairly high in fat, very low in carbs, and middle of the road protein (for a protein bar).  But the fact that it has 0 sugar alcohol, very low sugar, whey protein instead of soy and taste delicious really does make up for the higher fat content.<br /><br />Now it isn't really a downside but they are dry and make your mouth water a ton - make sure you have something to drink with them. But really these are my favorite protein/energy bars out there.

review/summary: It's like a cookie . . . with protein!  Yum, yum, yum.
review/text: I stumbled upon these quite by accident: a co-worker left them in the kitchen (people often bring in leftovers or things to share).  I read the package and mused "Creme filled wafer bar?  Intriguing."  I'd never heard the words "wafer" and "protein" used in the same sentence.  But I remembered how much I used to love going to my grandma's house as a kid because she used to keep vanilla, chocolate and strawberry wafer cookies in the cookie jar.<br /><br />These tasty, light crunchy wafers do remind me of those wafer cookies from my childhood.  The peanut butter ones are sweetened with fructose and stevia.  Stevia is a natural swetener with a sightly unusual taste that might be jarring if you're not used it.  It's sweet, but doesn't taste quite like sugar, which is what I like about it.  These bars are just sweet enough to be enjoyable, but not sweet enough that I would want to devour a whole box of them like I would a candy bar.<br /><br />They are light and crispy, and perfect as a snack or a treat.  They're only 10 grams of carbs and 5 grams of sugar [just over a teaspoon] - perfect if you're watching your carbs and want a sweet[ish] snack.  I brought the chocolate one with me to the movies the other night, and while other people had their candy, I had my own "candy" to enjoy, without the suagr high and with the benefit of 13 g of portein.  I can't see a big, buff muscley guy getting a lot out of them [men need more calories & protein], but for me, they are the perfect addition to my health and fitness plan.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change [for nutritional purposes] would be to add more fiber.  But I suppose adding that would affect the texture and possibly the taste.

review/summary: Best Power Bar.  Low Sugar
review/text: I have been searching for a power bar with high protein and very low sugar do to health reasons.  This is the perfect solution.  Tastes great...no cardboard taste here!!  The whey chocolate tastes like chocolate.  I almost feel guilty eating it!!  During vists with family and friends during Easter I was able to contain my urges during desert time.  While everyone else was chowing down on sugary cakes, pies and chocolate, I whipped out my protein bar and felt like part of the group!<br /><br />Thank you for the awesome product.  I will be ordering a lot more.

review/summary: My Doctor suggested these
review/text: So far I have only tried the Vanilla and Chocolate and they were both excellent! These bars were suggested by one of the top weight loss Doctors in the country. Combining these bars for breakfast, having a protein and vegetable for lunch and a protein and vegetable for dinner and sugar free jello or sugar free pudding .for dessert I have lost 14 pounds in 4 weeks and I don't have much more to lose!<br /><br />My Doctor told me that you must multiply the grams of protein in this bar times 2.5 to get the true grams of protein, since the protein used in these bars are di- and tri- peptides, and you absorb 2.5 more of the actual protein than in a regular protein meal. Therefore the true protein grams are:<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cream: 32.5g Protein<br />Peanut Butter Fudge: 32.5g Protein<br />Triple Chocolate: 32.5g Protein<br />Cookies & Cream: 35g Protein<br />Vanilla Cream: 35g Protein<br />Wild Berry Cream: 35g Protein

review/text: Gave the vanilla cookie to my husband who is a diabetic. He has been missing the sweet baked goods he used to be able to eat. He said this tasted like a cookie. The carb count is good but the fat content is high so we only use this as a treat when he really needs something sweet and other low carb food is not satisfying him. Highly recommend it in moderation. We want to try some of the other flavors now.

They aren't grainy like many others and they keep me full when I need it as an afternoon or preworkout snack. Sometimes there is a bit of dry after taste, but it is quickly solved with a swigg of water.

review/summary: Fantastic bar
review/text: I am recovering from pretty extensive GI surgery, so while I need a lot of protein, I have to be careful about what I eat to get it. I am on a bland diet and sensitive to many things right now, so I was having a hard time figuring out new things to eat during the day that are still somewhat healthy.<br /><br />I researched protein bars for days and all of them had either tons of sugar alcohols or were loaded with nuts or fiber. I needed one that would be easily digestible. I was SO glad when I found these but I only purchased one because I was still skeptical. Needless to say, here I am on Amazon buying them by the box.<br /><br />These bars are light, easy to digest, don't sit in your stomach like a brick, and one bar in the morning will curb your hunger until you're ready for lunch. I appreciate that they have 3 new bars that are sucralose free. I just wish they had more flavors!!!

This bar is lighter than most power bars on the market and tastes DELICIOUSLY like a desert!<br /><br />I only tried the vanilla flavor therefore I can't recommend other flavor but I am heading to my local Trader Joe's to get cookie n cream and the berry flavor to try (am tired of the chocolate and peanut butter varieties among all the energy bars).<br /><br />The vanilla wafer isn't too sweet and the crunch wafer is a great alternative from the usual soft/dense/chewy energy bars out there.

They do however have sugar in the ingredient list, but only have 5 grams of sugar for the whole bar.

review/summary: Puppy Soup good for MY soul
review/text: I went through several brands of wet food: Iaams, Eagle Pack, Canidae, etc. before finally settling on Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul as my girls canned food. They have tolerated it well (unlike the Iaams & Canidae which caused cowpie). My puppies are thriving, getting quality nutrition & ,thankfully, it's not breaking the bank. It's easy to find locally & online. That was the only downside to the Eagle Pack which did wonder's for one of my Dobergirl's HOD, I had a really hard time finding it locally. On Chicken Soup Puppy their coats are shiny & soft. I am very careful not to feed anything with corn, lamb, or wheat due to thier food allergies. I also like all the added veggies, vitamins & minerals found in this brand. Good stuff all for about the same cost as "grocery store" food....but MUCH higher quality.

review/summary: One of the best affordable wet puppy foods that I have found
review/text: After doing a bit of research I decided that I should either feed my dog this or Merrick puppy food.  All the other ones I saw either had ingredients that I didn't want to give him or cost considerably more.  Of the two, I think Merrick might be a better dog food, but this one didn't have anything in it that I found objectionable and the difference in price will add up over time so I decided to go with Chicken Soup.  My dog is still a puppy, but I accidentally ordered the adult formula instead of the puppy formula the first time I ordered it.  My dog didn't seem as interested in his food after I switched him from the adult to the puppy formula.  He got over that after a couple days, but I was surprised by that.  I was also surprised to find a can in the middle of the package that was severely dented on the side.  Since it was in the middle of the case that means that it was already dented when it was packaged and not damaged during shipment.  At least the seal wasn't broken, but if it had been dented any further it very well could have been.  Despite that I still think that this is an amazing deal for dog food of this quality.

review/summary: My dog loves it!
review/text: I have a Weimaraner puppy that I got at 8 months old he was a little underweight and I was having trouble keeping him from losing weight because he can be nervous in new situations. Since he lived in the counrt and moved to the city everything was new. I had him on Puppy Chow because that is what he was on when I got him. I bought a big bag the first week I had him home and wanted to give him a little something extra that was healthier than Puppy Chow. I did not realize how little meat was in the puppy chow at first:( Also he would not eat the puppy chow if I was not home so I started adding a little soft food in with his normal food. Some stuff he would eat, others he would just pick out, and some he would not eat at all. I found this stuff at Pet World and it had everything I wanted in it and it was inexpensive! I had to try it, and my dog loves it he will eat it even if I am not home. I only give him about � can with each meal at first and refrigerate the rest for his next meal. Now he is up to � to � a can each meal. This way he still has some hard food and some soft. It has been great he is gaining weight gradually and looks super healthy. His coat is nice and shinny and he is more active.  I love this food. You can even see pieces of meat and veggies in the food. It is not in chunks it is ground up so he does not try picking out the soft stuff and leaving out the hard food. Great food highly recommend

Besides these teas, I recently tried several other Bentley teas -- blueberry, raspberry, peach & ginger, and mango -- and I have to report that I also disliked them.  The Bentley teas seem to have very different smells compared to other teas, like Twinings, Tazo, Ahmad, etc.<br /><br />Although I've tried many teas that didn't impress me, the Bentley teas are the first that I have found that I completely dislike.  Given the mixture of very positive and very negative reviews for their teas, I'm guessing that it is a situation where people have strong reactions to the smell of their teas and either love them or hate them.

review/text: I loooooooooove this tea! It is simply delicious; I have shared it with many friends, and it's always a hit. Anyone who loves ginger will love it. The Tulsi adds a wonderful depth to the flavour that seems to mix very well with the ginger (I have also ordered the Organic India Tulsi Jasmine tea and was very disappointed; the Tulsi tasted kind of odd... I got used to it, but it was far from 'delicious'.) If you like sweet things, add honey. One word of caution: it takes a little trial and error to get the brewing length right for this tea; if you steep it too long it can (like any ginger tea, in fact) develop an unpleasant bitter taste.

review/text: I love blue corn tortillas and their products. I had been eating the Guiltless Gourmet brand Blue Corn Tortilla Chips for many years but ultimately found their chips a bit thick & bland. I decided to try out Garden of Eatin, and I am glad I did. Thinner and crispier than the GG brand with a richer blue corn flavor. If I didn't know they were baked, I'd think they were fried! My only complaint is the excessive salt which is super obvious on a dark blue chip. I just brush the extra salt off but this can be a pain. I'd buy a salt-free option if they offered it in their baked blue chips, but they only offer it in the fried blue chips. For now, these'll do. I like eating dipping them into my homemade, low-salt guacamole- YUM!!

review/summary: Too salty and nearly expired.
review/text: I ordered a case of these chips from Amazon because I like the regular Garden of Eatin blue chips and usually like baked chips better than fried.  I ordered a case (and put myself on subscription) to get the best price and figured I could eat a couple of cases a year.  But these chips are too salty - eating them actually burns my lips!  And all of the bags in the case I received from Amazon on January 5 have "best by" dates of February 3, 2010.  How am I supposed to eat 12 bags of too salty chips in less than a month?  Since Amazon does not allow returns on this item, I'll probably just donate my case to the food bank.  I highly recommend that before you order this item, buy a test bag at Whole Foods first.  And don't order a case unless you can use it within a month.  Learn from my experience!

review/summary: like stale popcorn
review/text: These 1.5" rounds are cut too small for dipping, and may be too fragile for proper Tortilla dishes - so it's a shame I'm now stuck with a case of them.  considering the soy is at the end of the ingredient list after various oils and before the salt, then such soy is just a marketing gimmick to help excuse such a disappointing blue corn chip.  Target's Archer Farms Organic Blue Corn With Flax Seed Tortilla Chips - are much better and cheaper.  Thank you Amazon for double boxing this and sending out a 3 Month long dated product during a 50% off sale.

review/summary: Watch Out Whole Foods
review/text: The chips are great, with a family of seven the only shelf life I worry about is keeping them there.  Really though, did you see the price?  Like $1.12 a bag. Whole foods may finnally have someone to hold them accountable destroying health food stores.  Thanks Amazon, for carring the brands whole foods wont bother with any more and for having prices that you can feed families with.

review/summary: Good, as long as they are still fresh
review/text: I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009.  When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected.  I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags....

review/summary: chips were stale, but my money was refunded
review/text: I purchased these chips since they are so much cheaper than what they cost on the grocery.  they did not expire for about 2 months, but the first 2 or 3 bags we ate were stale, plus many were broken up.  I wrote amazon and they did give me a prompt refund, so their customer service is excellent.<br />we have since opened some more bags and they do not seem as stale, but I still do not believe they taste as fresh as the ones from grocery.<br />I may try reordering these since they are such a good deal and hopefully can give a better review the next time.

review/summary: I love the sesame in these chips, you will too!
review/text: I love sesame in general. It makes foods more satisfying. There are two brands of blue corn sesame chips I know of; this one and one by Kettle. I think I might prefer the Kettle brand a little over this one since they use sprouted corn. Somehow that improves the flavor a little. These are still a 5 star product though. Sadly, I just searched for the Kettle chips and found they have been discontinued, so not only are these a great choice for sesame blue goodness they are your only choice!<br /><br />Of course chips like these are pretty high in fat, so it is not a good idea to eat them too often. They are quite addictive as well. For a little addition to a lunchtime meal you will not be disappointed. I hope you like them as much as I do.<br /><br />-Dan

review/summary: NOT a Black Bean chip!
review/text: Although labeled "Black Bean Chips," unlike the (now unavailable) Trader Joe's version these are CORN chips with some black bean thrown in.  That's misleading.  They should be labeled Corn & Black Bean chips.  They don't taste bad, as far as chips go.  But they are definitely nowhere near as good as the old Trader Joe's variety.

review/summary: Good quality with a quaint, natural taste
review/text: I've been eating these chips with my lunch every day for over two years now. I love the taste first of all. Unlike two other black bean corn chip products I have tried (and more and more chip makers seem to be making black bean corn chips now), these are what they say they are: corn chips with black beans in them - - no lime or herb or any other kind of "flavor enhancer".<br /><br />I like the price of the chips here on Amazon. A 7.5 ounce bag sells for around $3 a bag, sometimes less when on sale.  Here, the case price works out to about $2.25 a bag,  - and delivery is free.

But while traveling I bought a bag of these chips ($3.97 I might add) at a natural market type store and just loved them (other than the price).<br /><br />The chips themselves don't have a high oil or greasy taste that some enjoy, but the selection of spices and herbs that Garden of Eatin' has developed is just GREAT.<br /><br />I have bought three cases so far and just love them!

review/summary: The best corn chips out there
review/text: Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.  They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.  If you already know you like blue chips, get them here, as this price is unbeatable.

review/summary: The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization
review/text: Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet.  Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole "organic" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this "red hot" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.
