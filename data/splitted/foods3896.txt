review/summary: Didn't touch her at all.
review/text: This completely didn't work for my 4lb toy poodle. I even used two full syringes and NOTHING. She was still just as stressed during her walk in the city. She is a rescue with high anxiety levels even after 2 years of nothing but pure love. I'm trying to go the more natural way to help her anxiety, unfortunately it doesn't seem to be working.

review/summary: Limited Calming Effect
review/text: I bought this for my two teacup Yorkies, one is 11 years old and the other is only 4 months old.  I wasn't sure how much to use due to their tiny size (the 11 year old only weighs 2.5 lbs and the puppy weighs just 2lbs), so to be on the safe side I only used one drop (not dropperful but one drop) per dog, it seemed to work on my puppy but had no effect at all on my 11 year old, so I increased his dosage to 2 drops and then three drops but still didn't seem to calm him at all.  I have used it a few times on the puppy and it appears to work, however, it in no way lasts 6 hours.  Within a 30 to 45 minutes it had worn off.  I didn't want to overdose him so I didn't give him any more.  For my yorkies it has been hit and miss, I've tried to contact a vet to see if I could increase the dosage but can't get a clear answer.  Overall, I would say it was worth the money because it wasn't expensive and it does work somewhat for the puppy, but it doesn't have the calming effect that I thought it would for both dogs.

review/summary: This product is a GOD-send!
review/text: I have a Jack Russell Terrier (JRT), and they are naturally highstrung, and hyper. My dog has a fit when it's bath or nail trimming, or teeth brushing time, and gets carsick. Also, I work 3 nights a week, and he can be very destructive when left alone (JRT's need to be around people and suffer from separation anxiety).<br /><br />I give my little fella 2 dropperfuls about an hour before bathtime, and I can give him his bath, do his nails, and brush his teeth. YAYY!  I also find that giving him the same dosage helps him stay calm when I'm working those 3 nights and my son is better able to handle him.<br /><br />I truly love this product and stay stocked uo. BEST part is that it's all natural!

review/summary: This stuff is amazing
review/text: We recently moved to an area where there are frequent and massive thunder storms. Since we got here my husbands guide dog has developed a fear of thunder storms almost on the level of Marley in the book Marley and me. After listening to him howl, pace and try to dig through the walls I convinced my husband to try this on his dog. He was afraid it would interfere with the dogs ability to guide. Well it took 5 minutes and the dog was laying calmly on the floor snoozing. He would still look up and shift when the thunder and lightning stuck but he didn't  freak out. When the husband got up and went to work the dog guided butifully and even though the storm was still going on the dog was calm and relaxed, even managing to use the bathroom in the storm before going into the office.

review/summary: Doesn't Work.
review/text: I have 2 cats, 2 very hyper and active cats.  I gave them 3 drops, waited 2 hours and saw no change.  I thought it may work or kick in once they are in a stressful situation.  Last night a big thunderstorm came through, I gave both cats 7 drops (way above the max), still no change.  I got these drops to help calm them when they go to the vet.  My youngest cat hates the smell and taste, while the oldest one will do her best to eat all of it.  Both cats are affected by catnip, so I don't know why it doesn't work.  This is a waste of money, I will have to get medicine from the vet to calm them.<br /><br />Add:  Both cats are under 2 years old.  I'm not sure if that makes a difference.

review/summary: Questionable........
review/text: I bought Richard's Organics Pet Calm for our Yorkie to calm her down when we travel. My husband and I are long haul truck drivers and at first our youngest Yorkie was okay traveling over the road. However, when we travel over rough roads (and there are a lot of rough roads out there) she starts to pant and shake. She will take Richard's Organics Pet Calm readily enough (it has a sweet taste to it) and does get that "sleepy eyed" look, but I didn't see enough of a calming reaction to justify buying it again. However, I haven't tried it under "normal" stress circumstances, such as at home during a thunderstorm. I think that for milder stress situations, that Richard's Organics Pet Calm might work.

review/summary: Great for dog's that have a tough time traveling.
review/text: This stuff is amazing.  My poor little dog HATES traveling.  My family lives in AZ and I live in Los Angeles so whenever I drive home I take him with me.  He shakes and pants and whines the whole time.  Finally I'd had enough on the return trip so I picked up a bottle of this stuff.  The dosage says 1-4 droppers for dogs under 40 lbs.  He's 12 pounds.  I gave him 4.<br /><br />Within an hour, his ears had lowered, he couldn't keep his eyes open, his little legs were buckling.  It was actually hilarious, and extremely effective.  Little thing couldn't be stressed if he wanted to.  Definitely recommend it.  Now my grandma is using it for her dog that is a terrible traveler.  Working great for her too!

review/summary: Original ingredients(+5), Kava Kava (1) - I'm confused
review/text: The "original" Synergy Labs Richard's Organics Pet Calm WAS FANTASTIC.  However, if you look at the ingredients of the bottle "now" available, it shows only Kava-Kava as the active ingredient; not the original ingredients valarian, chamomile, hops, Passion flower, hops, skull cap.  Kava Kava has been under investigation.<br /><br />The ORIGINAL formula was wonderful.  I have a 6-yr old "Rottie" who loves it & it was one of the best things I had found for her. I won't order Kava Kava and have had to find another supplier using the other ingredients.  However; if Synergy Labs offers the original Pet Calm with the ORIGINAL ingredients; I will order 10 and have several pet groomers interested in the product.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: This soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy! I really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up, nice texture. It is very satisfying to me. I'm a single gal who doesn't really cook & am often in a hurry for my next meal, and I find that this soup really hits the spot. Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours.<br /><br />Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :)<br /><br />One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.) Oh well, can't have it all....

review/summary: The legendary cake still pleases!  Old-fashioned goodness
review/text: For those of you not familiar with the great Urban Legend of the Red Velvet Cake recipe that cost $240 dollars, see Jan Harold Brunvan's series of books on Urban Legends starting with THE VANISHING HITCHIKER available here on Amazon.  Most of us know the legend in it's more modern form as the "Mrs. Field's Chocolate Chip cookie recipe" that some poor unsuspecting soul requested and was told would cost "Two-forty" and who assumed that meant Two Dollars and forty cents only to receive a credit card bill of $240.  Needless to say the legend is NOT true, never WAS true & never will be true be it about the cookies, Red Velvet Cake or Waldorf Salad( Another part of the legend).<br /><br />Red Velvet Cake started out as a pretty and regional variant of Devil's Food cake and is really just a wonderfully light chocolate cake with red colouring added to it.  It is often topped with either a vanilla buttercream frosting or in more modern times with cream cheese frosting.  The Duncan Hines mix is probably a better option than any of the current recipes floating around that are often remnents of the old Urband Legend for a variety of reasons.  Many of the legendary recipes have bizarre added ingredients intended to make the recipe look weird or authentic and often call for far more food coloring than is needed, imparting a bitter flavor and ghastly colour to the finished cake.<br /><br />Having had the Duncan Hines mix as a child and again more recently, I can attest to its superiority over most of the existing recipes for Red Velvet Cake.  The Duncan Hines Cake Mix has a lovely chocolate flavor and just the right amount of red color to make the final product interesting.  When made as a layer cake (preferabley with four thin layers as opposed to two thick ones) and topped with Cream cheese icing, the Duncan Hines Red Velvet Cake makes a wonderfully festive Holiday cake sure to provoke conversation.  You may find yourself having to give away a number of the boxes of mix you now have to friends eager to make it themselves and share the intriguing legend.  The finished cake truly is a show-stopper!<br /><br />Conventional wisdom is that the cake itself began as a Southern tradition and indeed, it can still be found on the dessert menus of some venerable Southern eateries.  The best I ever had was in Nashville at an old Inn but it wasn't all that superior to the Duncan Hines mix which is more moist and lighter in texture than most Tradtional ( as opposed to "legendary" ) recipes.<br /><br />You can still find elaborate versions of Red Velvet cake popping up in places such as the Swiss Colony Holiday Catalog but for outragious prices.  Do what I do and make your own!  Since it is near impossible to find anywhere else, go ahead and order the mix here.  Even if you only make it a few times a year, the mix lasts a long time and is a good value when you consider its "Star Quality" as a dessert and a natural conversation piece!  I know of one mom whose daughter got an 'A' when using the cake as a demonstration of modern Folklore in her high-school social studies class!<br /><br />If all that info isn't enough inducement to try it...just remember..it's chocolate cake for heaven's sake!  And...it's pretty!  What more could a person want?

Though I'm not a cake making type of woman I decided to give it a try. I followed the directions on the box & my cake came out delicious.

review/summary: Staining
review/text: This cake is fine in terms of taste and texture, but it is far too messy.<br /><br />The dye is so strong that a single drop of the batter will stain your clothing and be incredibly difficult to wash out. Not only that, but even after the cake is cooked, the red dye is still active and even the solid crumbs can stain your clothing. If I serve this cake on a plate then put the dirty dish in the sink and then rinse the dirty dish, the sink area will turn pink and I end up having to wash the sink after I wash the dishes!

review/summary: great beans, get some but check shipping
review/text: ok, yeah, so, like, living here in the land of the pinto bean, I must admit, this is what I live on, along with guacamole for dinner, but these pinto beans have really taken over my digestive pipes and tank. This is where we grow them and this is where we eat them. Oh hey, refritos or refried beans really doesn't mean that you fry them AGAIN, it means they are so well cooked as to get mushy and easily able to be rendered into the consistency of mashed potatoes, which is how people like them and yeah, they are great htat way, too. So anyway, I saw this twenty five pound bag available here upon my beloved amazon and right away I am going, like, I am down, I'm there! but then I checked the shipping and it increases the cost by twice again, and I'm now going, like, you know, whoah Nelly . . .<br /><br />Still, gotto drive thirty miles or more to get a 25 or 50 or 100 pound bag, so does it all work out or what?<br /><br />I'll keep a close eye on that shipping, and on how many beans I have left. Running out fast . . .<br /><br />the food of life!<br />along with the other three sisters: corn and squash. I have kind of cut out the corn, and the flour tortillas too, hard to do in this northern Chihuahuan region, but yeah, and the squash, well, don't really know how to cook it much, but these beans? heavenly, although well, you might also want to get a case of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7QRSK">Beano Food Enzyme Dietary Supplement Tablets, 100-Count Bottles, (Pack of 2)</a> if not an old cranky hermit like me!

review/summary: eh... it weaned me off my addiction. that's a plus!
review/text: Ill say something positive first...The candy tasted ok for it being sugar free. I'm a fan of the jolly rancher gummy bears, so nothing will ever beat that. That's why I switched to this to cut down on the sugar. Instead this experience weaned me off gummies for sure lol I didn't think that would happen - ever. Anyways, every time a craving kicked in, I would forget my last experience and eat a handful. Mind you my hands are small, so within the hour my stomach would rumble and build up the most painful gas I have ever had. This would last for several hours and well into the next day. I had to squeeze my ass cheeks to keep the fart in until I was somewhere private several times to relieve the pressure only for it to build back up again minutes later. I thought it would be funny to play a prank on a friend of mine from this 5lb bag I bought that I was going to throw away well before even consuming less than a pound. If any of us lost, we had to eat 2 hands full of this candy. Of course I won, like I always do with him (haha) and it was so funny hearing him complain in anguish from the gas pressure. The string of farts was hilarious.

review/summary: Great Tasting Syrup
review/text: I have been trying many different brands and types of maple syrup because my family loves homemade waffles and pancakes and Coombs Organic Grade B is the best so far. The Grade B has a richer flavor than Grade A. It may be a little pricey but keep in mind that it lacks all of the chemicals and additives. It's just pure maple syrup!

review/summary: Super Sweet Deal
review/text: This is much better than man-made syrups. It is sweeter and has a deeper flavor than the high fructose or corn syrup varieties. I was expecting it to be thick, not runny, but that is not a problem with me. A little of this can go a long way. I was also expecting 32oz to "look" a little bigger than this jug, but it is well worth it.

review/text: this maple syrup is so rich in flavor-this is truly grade B maple syrup<br />the price is much better than in a specialty grocery store as well<br />the texture thickens in consistency if you keep it refrigerated, but once you leave it at room temperature it's a bit runny but still really delicious.<br />this grade of maple syrup tends to have such a richer flavor-it's like regular grade A times 4 in flavor but without the extra sugar.<br />it's still a bit pricey for some, but very worth it, you'll notice you won't need need to use a lot at one sitting as well because the flavor is so rich.

review/text: I did lots of research in my quest to find reasonably-priced, 100% maple syrup.  I settled on Coombs Family Farms Grade B, and we have been so pleased with it!  I have two children under the age of three, and they love the rich and savory flavor as much as we do.  It has been a big hit at our house!  After trying this maple syrup, I'll never buy anything less than 100%.  We like this brand a lot, but the price was good and we were able to get the 15% discount in addition.  If they continue to offer it, we would buy from them again.

review/summary: Fantastic Flavor...Hooked!
review/text: I admit that for many years I only liked the "bad" stuff in the grocery store that was chock full of high fructose corn syrup and didn't have maple syrup in it!  I just liked the flavor.  Other maple syrups (which were Grade A) just tasted watery to me and didn't have that rich flavor I wanted.<br /><br />But since we're trying to eat healthier now and getting rid of stuff with HFCS in it I wanted to find a syrup that tasted really good.  And I've found it!<br /><br />This syrup is really flavorful, dark in color, and very rich.  I just absolutely love it.  Never again will I go back to using the fake stuff when the real stuff is so incredibly tasty - not to mention better for you!  Thanks Coombs Family Farms for making this.  It's fantastic!

I remember reading that folks use grade A for eating and B more for cooking.  This is only be used for eating!!  I'm so glad I signed up for the subscription offering!

review/text: We really like maple syrup. We try to get grade B for the darker color and stronger flavor, but grade A is also pretty darn good. This is a big jug (32 oz) and will last you a while. We transfer it to smaller containers that we can heat up for use at the table. This probably isn't a better deal than you can get at the grocery (with shipping) but it is a good value if you live far away from a larger town and can combine your maple fix with other orders to defray or avoid shipping charges.

review/summary: Thick and just the right amount of sweetness and maple
review/text: I started subscribing to this syrup this summer as a replacement for my usual Nature's Promise syrup.  I'll admit it took me a little while to get used to because the taste and consistency are very different form the Nature's Promise (NP).<br /><br />Consistency<br />Coombs is thicker than NP which allows me to pour a thin and controlled stream onto my waffles. I don't like to drown my waffles. I do tend to lose a small amount of syrup onto the edge of the container but I think that must happen with all syrups.<br /><br />Flavor<br />I think the flavor is a little stronger than Nature's Promise. Maybe more than a little stronger.  I'll admit at first I liked Nature's Promise better but I just had to get used to the stronger flavor of Coombs.  Now that I have I can't go back.  And I even tried just out of curiosity.  NP is tasteless when compared to Coombs.  Coombs is a perfect compliment to my whole grain waffles.  Just the right amount of maple flavor and sweetness which allows me to also taste the waffles.<br /><br />Bottle<br />I like the bottle.  The extra unopened bottle sits on a small wooden kitchen cart with some other things and it looks good. Seems to fit in.  Of course you have to refrigerate the opened bottle.  It's easy to use. It has a small handle that I think can fit most people's index finger comfortably. Then you grab the skinny neck with your thumb and middle finger.  It really seems to be very ergonomic.  Very easy to pour.<br /><br />Value<br />When subscribing it's like getting a free bottle of Nature's Promise for every two 32 oz bottles I get.  And because I can easily control the pour I can make one bottle last about two months and that is using it almost every day.<br /><br />Great product.  I highly recommend.

review/text: Very tasty syrup & organic too. Grade B is less processed and should have more maple flavor than Grade A syrups. I'm knocking a star off because of the high price which reduces its value, but sometimes there are sales and coupons that make it a much better buy. If price were no object, then I'd give it 5 stars. Much better than pouring high fructose corn syrup with artificial flavors on your pancakes and waffles!

I've poured it out and placed it in a plastic bottle, so no big deal.  Coomb's farm:  I think people would still buy your product if you have an option of selling it in a bottle for $1 more.  But I guess it'll cost you guys more for shipping and another line of machinery.

review/text: Unlike most "Factory Farmed" maple forests, the forests that Coombs Family Farms use are 100% natural forests. I don't mind paying extra knowing that these trees weren't injected with any growth hormones, grown in high-density sapling nurseries or treated with any petro-chemicals, unlike most Vermont "Forests," where regular, non-organic maple syrup comes from.

review/summary: Yummy and organic, what's not to like?
review/text: I prefer Grade B because it has superior flavor.  I prefer organic because it doesn't utilize pesticides in the orchard or chemicals in the extraction process. I prefer Amazon because similar syrup is 30% more at the grocery store.<br /><br />I purchased this as a birthday gift for my husband since he is a maple syrup addict.  I hope he enjoys it because we're going back to our frozen fruit compote breakfast topping due to the amount of sugar in syrup. Yes, syrup *is* sugar.  But, fruit syrup is tasty too, with a side of nutrition.

review/summary: Price is good, but container is HDPE plastic
review/text: The price I paid ended up being 25% off what I would've spent at the grocery store on 32 oz of this brand in glass containers.<br /><br />However, with the price savings out of mind, I don't like that this comes in a HDPE (#2) plastic jug, simply because it is not reusable like glass is and HDPE breaks down easily with temperature changes over time, leaching into the product.<br /><br />Since real Maple Syrup only takes a dab for tons of flavor, even our large family of 5 won't get through this in a year likely (despite our weekly pancake breakfasts). This makes me wonder if the plastic molecules will start their leaching process and then we'll be eating plastic :-/ I think I'd rather get glass bottles in a smaller size - the savings isn't that great.

review/summary: a hit with the whole family
review/text: The negative:  Grade B syrup is normally 'mapley' with caramel notes. This syrup LACKS the strong maple flavors that make it suitable for cooking or a good match for those who like strong flavors, but it does NOT have the complexity or finesse of a Grade A Amber. In short it is rather bland and pedestrian for maple syrup. What we don't know is whether the trees tapped for this label vary from year to year but this batch is uninteresting. I bought it as an alternative to Whole Foods label (about $20) but quite frankly the Whole Foods Grade A Amber has a stronger maple flavor with more complexity and the Whole Foods Grade B is significantly stronger in flavor. I would rate the Whole Foods Grade A Amber as a 4 star minus, and the Grade B as 4-5 stars. Having grown up in sugar maple country and bought syrup from the farmers in unmarked gallon cans ('store syrup' never entered our house), I have plenty of experience with maple syrup. [Tip: maple trees and maple syrup are 'organic' by definition. Farmers who tap trees add nothing. Don't pay more for 'organic'.] At our house we 'sugared off' every Winter. For those who know what I'm talking about, read on. For those who don't have any idea, you may be happy with this product.<br />The positive: This syrup is priced right (purchased at $17.31). It is a good buy and you should not be shy at purchasing. It's really about a 3 star minus or 2.5 stars.

review/summary: First time buyer...mixed reaction
review/text: This is literally the first "real" maple syrup our family ever tried.<br />It was a good deal on Amazon, and I'm always looking for more natural choices to feed my family.  Overall, I like it.<br />My kids and hubby, however, have their reservations.  It is much thinner than standard "syrup" their used to, and the Grade B definitely has a strong maple flavor.  So if you like that, this is the syrup for you.<br /><br />Once this is all used up (I plan on baking with it as well), I plan on re-ordering the same brand,<br />only the Grade A.  Maybe that will ease them into true maple syrup a little easier!<br /><br />All in all, a great price and good syrup.  My family just isn't quite ready for the strong maple kick!  Three (and a half) stars.  Minus one star for super strong maple flavor and 1/2 star for too thin of consistency (for my tastes).  Best part is, the ingredient label!  If you force your picky husband to review his current imitation syrup in comparison to this, he'll be shocked.  100% pure maple syrup vs. Corn syrup, sugar, imitation flavorings/colorings, etc...  Go natural - buy real syrup!

review/text: This is only the second time I have purchased pure maple syrup.  The first I bought at the grocery store; it was a grade A.  It lacked much maple flavor.  So I bought this grade B syrup, thinking the stronger flavor would be better liked.  We hate it.  It has a very bitter after taste.  I don't know what to do now becuase we don't like the grade B, but the grade A isn't strong enough in flavor.

review/summary: Great stuff at first, but not for long (see my edit within review)
review/text: I liked the flavor of this syrup at first, as did my wife.  It has a unique, natural taste, albeit not as sweet as the "store-bought" name-brand syrups that you find in the grocery stores.  But then again, apparently the sugar content is less, thus it is undoubtedly better for you. But, I guess that's pointless if you end up not wanting to use it.  My kids would not touch the stuff.<br /><br />Also, it is expensive for what you get.  I bought it at a special discount from the regular Amazon price, and it was still expensive even with the discount.  A bit too expensive, IMHO.  The photo can be a bit deceiving too; it comes in a very small jug...check the ounce figure carefully before making your buying decision.<br /><br />Edit - Sept 2010:  I thought I would update this review and let you know that after a few months, we ended up throwing this syrup away (about a third was left) because it had stayed on the shelf for so long, mold started to grow.  My kids continued to refuse to eat it.  Even I started going back to the store-bought brands. I read an interesting article in Esquire magazine that made me remember this product and my review...and made me smile:<br /><br />"People give 100 percent real maple syrup as gifts. People take their kids to farms to see it collected and cooked. In the Northeast, it's extolled. Which is strange, because it's not as good as Aunt Jemima or Mrs. Butterworth's, its mass market imitators. First of all, syrup shouldn't run, it should ooze. Real maple syrup runs. The mass market stuff - the stuff you grew up on - that stuff oozes. It has viscosity. So instead of going straight into the pancakes, like water into a sponge, it maintains their integrity. And the taste: Mass-market syrup is sweet.  Real maple syrup is a beguiling combination of sugar and resin. Which is authentic, sure. But bark is authentic.  Is there anything else we eat that tastes vaguely of tree?"<br /><br />I couldn't have said it better. I'll give it two stars instead of one because we did muddle through the stuff for a week or two and at least at first, perhaps because of the novelty, we though we liked it.  However, our enthusiasm quickly dwindled.  Think twice before you buy.<br /><br />Second edit: Sept 2010 - I found this information regarding real maple syrup, which may be why this Grade B version made me (and my kids) avoid it...apparently this grade is best for cooking:<br /><br />Here's how real maple syrups differ from each other...<br /><br />Grade A Light Amber or Vermont Fancy usually is made early in the season and has a mild, delicate flavor. It's often used for maple candies.<br /><br />Grade A Medium Amber is darker and has a more robust maple flavor. It's typically used for pancakes and waffles.<br /><br />Grade A Dark Amber, darker still, has strong maple and caramel-like flavors. It can be used for pancakes if you like a more intense flavor, as well as for cooking.<br /><br />Grade B is very dark and has the strongest flavor, mostly maple but also with hints of caramel. It's the best choice for cooking.

review/summary: Grade B Organic
review/text: There are generally 3 grades of maple syrup. Grade A is the first run - Mild in taste, sweet and with fewer minerals than the other grades. It is more expensive and less desirable (health and taste wise). Grade B is the second run with more minerals plus more maple taste. Grade C is the third run with even more minerals and an even stronger taste of maple and it's slightly less pleasant for most people.<br /><br />Maple syrup has a large variety of minerals and vitamins and Grade B Organic is my favorite, considering it's stronger flavor and higher nutrition content. Of course, Organic is the only way to eat food now, but that's another story.<br /><br />Coombs Family Farm provides a very satisfactory grade B organic Maple Syrup! I've used a lot!

review/text: There's maple syrup and there's maple syrup. My wife and I are from the East Coast (she from Vermont) and we've tried maple syrup from other regions and those just don't measure up to a Vermont syrup. Although this product does say some of the raw materials come from Canada, this is an excellent example of a Vermont Maple Syrup. As a "Grade B" product, it has the rich, deep-bodied flavor and color one would expect, but this one makes pancakes and waffles a different experience entirely. I would recommend the Coombs product highly to anyone who's looking for a top quality maple syrup.

review/summary: Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug
review/text: Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug:<br /><br />I remember when my grandmother would make pancakes, waffles or potato pancakes and the maple syrup was just so delightful to the taste. She would warm it up on the old gas stove.  You'd think that all of the major brands of "pancake syrup maple flavored," would stop using high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />One day last week I had the chance to take my granddaughter out grocery shopping with me.  Not one of my best things to do, but I thought, how would she learn to shop and look for the good stuff, not the crap that's advertised on television, but the products that really work and the one's that are good for you.  Reading the labels is a major chore as what you thought was in the product wasn't even close to being in the product. Somebody has to teach her and it was my lucky day.<br /><br />Take for example, pancake syrup or what used to be called maple syrup in my day.  You look at the labels, today... never is there mention of a maple tree, not even close, all fructose or high fructose corn syrup.  So, I told her that maple syrup comes from sugar maple tree sap that has the water content reduced and I asked her if she could find a reference to a maple tree in the contents.  Well, you know the answer, there isn't any on the major or store brands.<br /><br />I told her that Coombs makes a maple syrup that reminded me of when I was growing up.  Well, after a few grocery stores later and checking their stock we came across the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup.<br /><br />Now, I know, I've been telling my granddaughter about how I grew up, so she wasn't going to let me off the hook so easily.  You guessed it... I made pancakes and we used the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup, warmed up on the stove just like grandma did.  She said, "That's the best Maple Syrup I've ever tasted."  I told her that's because it's real maple syrup.<br /><br />A lesson learned, and I was pleased to make pancakes for my granddaughter, this is one of those moments you don't forget in life.

review/text: Living in Nebraska, we can purchase real maple syrup in the store, but I really like supporting family farms directly.  This way, I'm pretty sure that the products I purchase are top quality.  If not, I can go to the producer.  I'm no conniseuer of maple syrup like some people on Amazon are, but I can say this has a great maple flavor, the consistency is a little thinner than store bought, imitation maple syrup, but that stuff has artificial thickeners in it.  Remember, this is tree sap, boiled down to reduce the water and increase the sugar content.  Nothing more nothing less.  This syrup makes you want to lick the plate when you're done with the pancakes.  One note, they need to do something to better protect the black plastic cap on the top of the jug because mine was broken when it came.  The jug is sealed well, so nothing spilled.  Not a big deal, but someone picky might pitch a fit about something trivial. Buy real maple syrup whether from this company or another, you owe it to yourself.

Do you think we would not notice the price change?<br />Watch what you pay since the subscribes are changing so much.  Plus, even if I asked for it now, the policy is not to ship until my assigned date next month anyway.<br />For now, I am going with another product and wait to see if they actually send me a jug of this or just cancel my current subscription to force me to change to the more expensive offer.

review/summary: One of the best syrups I've had
review/text: My family (myself, husband, toddler daughter) gobble this syrup up.  In the right syrup, we prefer Grade B over Grade A (which has nothing to do with the quality) because we like a more maple flavor (Granted, some syrups are bad no  matter what grade. This is not one of them).  This syrup has an amazing dark caramely aroma and a clean yet very full maple taste.  I am so glad that we don't need to use a lot for each pancake or waffle so that it lasts longer!  I also use this to make granola or add it to plain yogurt for a healthy snack.<br /><br />Past reviews have compared this to table syrup, also known as imitation syrup, such as Mrs. Butterworth's or Aunt Jemima's.  Please know that these two products are nothing alike and therefore really can't be compared.  It's the ol' apples and oranges thing.<br /><br />I hope you will try this syrup and enjoy it as much as we do!  We treat it like a bottle of liquid gold in the fridge.

review/text: The quote in the title of this review was from my boyfriend, who grew up in Canada and was convinced that America didn't have "real maple syrup." Determined to get better tasting stuff over the generic grade A syrup our grocery store had, I decided to try this Grade B Coombs Family Farms stuff based on the reviews. They weren't kidding, folks! It DOES taste better. The first few times we had breakfast with this, my bf exclaimed "This syrup is so good!" like he couldn't believe it. He still says it occasionally. Safe to say, this has earned its place as a staple pantry item in our household; with the subscribe and save, it's a pretty good deal.

review/text: True, natural goodness without high fructose corn syrup.  Just great maple flavor and sweetness with no GMO.  Coombs Family has great tasting maple syrup as Nature intended.  By the way, Grade B isn't lesser quality--it's darker, sweeter and fuller-bodied than the first run Grade A.

review/summary: Quality Grade B Syrup, Perfect For Cooking and Baking, Too
review/text: I love the taste of maple syrup. Well, that's not quite true. I love the taste of maple, period. :D<br /><br />I've been buying pure maple syrup for many, many years and was thrilled when I found out about Grade B syrup several years ago.<br /><br />Contrary to most rating systems, with maple syrup, the higher the grade, the more intense the flavor. I've seen some say that this syrup tastes too much like molasses. That wasn't my experience at all. I did find that to be true the one time I bought Grade C..that was too strong for sure. I've purchased several gallons of maple syrup over the years. This brand was right up there with brands that are much higher in price.<br /><br />I also use this syrup for regular applications like pancakes and french toast. I enjoy the strong flavor and the fact that it's not watery like grade A syrup can be. It's a must for cooking. I make a maple-walnut praline ice cream with it that is simply luscious. I've also used it to make maple breads, cakes and candies.<br /><br />A caveat: Please be sure to refrigerate the syrup after opening it. Mold can form in maple syrup if left at room temperature too long after opening (weeks, not hours). If you do forget and get mold, you can strain the syrup through cheesecloth and then boil it for 10 minutes or so, but it's better to avoid it altogether.<br /><br />If you like Log Cabin, this may not be the sryup for you.

review/summary: OMG This syrup is the best I have ever had
review/text: Every morning when my 5 year old gets up, he asks for pancakes, waffles, or french toast.  I am very happy about this because I love this syrup.  I have been even caught steeling a spoonful or 2 just for the flavor.  No more syrup from the store again.

review/text: I miss living in Vermont...and this syrup helps ease the pain, especially with pancakes! ;-)<br />It's a product of environmentally-friendly farms, too!<br />Get some for the coming cold months to prepare for those days when it snows and a nice hot breakfast with maple syrup will fit the bill!!

review/summary: Terrific!
review/text: Whoa! When reviewing this syrup, two things immediately come to mind: #1. Damn this is good syrup! #2.  Damn this is expensive syrup! With about 10 servings per 32 oz. jug (on pancakes) and at $23.00 per jug, you're averaging a little better than $2.00 per breakfast -- just for the syrup! Well, I can't afford that ..... Yet here I am buying ANOTHER jug. It really is that good. Last week in an attempt to save money I purchased a 64 oz. jug of Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup. It was $36.25 for a 64 oz. jug, which is vastly cheaper than Coombs Family Farms Organic Maple Syrup which is about $23.00 per 32 oz. jug; so you're looking at $46.00 per 64 oz. jug of Coombs compared to the $36.00 per 64 oz. jug of Hidden Springs Vermont. Unfortunately for us thrifty shoppers, the Hidden Springs Vermont is not in the same league as Coombs Organic, and even if I saved $25.00 per jug, I'd probably still go with Coombs -- that is an indication of just how much I love this syrup.<br /><br />Quite simply, I've never had syrup as delicious as Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B. I was raised on Ms. Buttersworth and other corn syrup w/ maple flavoring brands; in fact, I didn't try real maple syrup until about 6 months ago, and now I could never go back. I've tried a few brands including Highlands Sugarworks which was good and Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup which was not, yet none of them hold a candle to Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup.

review/summary: Dilute and runny
review/text: I like this Grade B product more than the Grade A product because of the stronger flavor.  Being organic, it is quite expensive.  My husband was shocked when he saw the size of the small jug.  Nonetheless, I am hoping my children are protected as much as possible from all the chemicals out there, though the degree of protection will be limited by the amount of chemical leachables from the plastic bottle.  I was disappointed that the packaging is not glass.  The product itself is very runny.  I am starting to believe that this is just the way natural syrup is.

review/summary: Robust, clean taste
review/text: This is a very good grade B maple syrup, with a deep, layered flavor and a good sweetness level.<br /><br />Contrary to what another reviewer mentioned, "organic" does not necessarily mean only that the farmer added nothing; "organic" means (according to Wikipedia, and others) that the syrups are produced using methods that do not involve modern synthetic inputs such as synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers.  If you have an organic farm, it means that there are no pesticides or chemical fertilizers used on the farm.<br /><br />I've tried other Grade B maple syrups (Highland, Trader Joe, plus another I can't remember the name of), and Coombs is at or near the top of the pack.<br /><br />A very good product.

review/summary: Deep, Rich Flavor and Family Owned Maple Farm
review/text: I love this maple syrup because it has a deep, rich flavor very wholesome tasting. How can people eat the artificial maple stuff from supermarkets?  There is no comparison between 100% maple syrup and the junk sold in supermarkets full of high fructose corn syrup and artificial flavors, additives.<br /><br />I have purchased it at natural food stores in the smaller 8 oz glass bottle, didn't note any difference in taste from the plastic jug - this is a terrific price since the 8 oz glass bottle sells for $9.00 which would work out to $36.00 compared to the big jug Subscribe and Save price you save a couple of dollars to purchase it in bulk.  Since 100% natural maple syrup has such a long shelf life it is a good deal.<br /><br />My favorite snack is fresh cranberries, walnuts, raisins, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg and cook it with rolled oats - drizzle Coombs Family Farm maple syrup in it - yummy - especially in the winter for breakfast.<br /><br />A post was written by a person who grew up on a New England maple syrup farm and said there is no difference between organic and non-organic maple syrup but I know I've seen non-organic maple syrup with additives like brown sugar, artifical additives, artificial flavors.
