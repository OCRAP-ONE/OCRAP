review/summary: Good, but I like Zevia Ginger Root Beer better
review/text: Even though I like Zevia ginger root beer better than this one, I seem to be drinking this up faster than Dr. Zevia, which is my second-favorite dark soda of theirs. (I bought this due to lack of availability of Zevia ginger root beer at a reasonable price.)

review/summary: best ever home cooked hashbrowns
review/text: I've tried my entire life to replicate a good plate of diner-style hash browns, I've finally found the trick.  These are essentially shelf-stable dehydrated potatoes.  I followed the box directions to cover in boiling water for a few minutes, then fry them up in margarine.  It worked great!  No question the best hash browns I've ever made, and a great accompaniment to my marinated steak grilled over an open fire.  see story and photo at http://www.baribob.net/?p=816

review/text: I love this product.  No stores in my area carried it, I wouldn't have gone on-line, however....the on-line purchase was for many boxes...and I'm okay with that!!  I've since found a store that carries it.<br /><br />YUM YUM....I've always love hash browns and here you can make them 'less greasy' than the kind you get when you eat out.  Though I confess I love to add olive oil to it to make them crispier.

review/summary: WAY TOO MUCH SEASONING
review/text: I am sorry I bought a dozen. I though I could save some money over store bought hash browns. But the onion taste and smell overpowers the dish.<br />I dumped out half of the first batch because of the strong taste and odor of onions. Then I tried rinsing thw second batch with lots of hot water, hoping to reduce the seasoning; but I could not reduce it.<br />I wrote the company asking them to make available the hash browns without seasoning but have not as yet had a response from them.<br />At the same time I bought a dozen of the Betty Crocker Cheddar Cheese dishes. I hoped we would eat one a week, but they use the same seasoning and too much of it. It was good the first time, okay the second and the third time the smell, which stunk up the whole house for a day, was outright objectional.<br />I signed up for the automatic shipment every six months but cancelled. I think we will have these for a year or more and may give give some to charity, too.

review/summary: Hard to find
review/text: We have been longtime fans of hash brown potatoes and Betty Crocker Hash Browns are a convenient and somewhat economical way to store them for spur of the moment use. Fresh grated potatoes taste a little better but take longer and are a mess to grate. Frozen potatoes cost more and take up more freezer space.I prefer to keep a few boxes of Betty Crocker Hash Brown mix in the pantry in case dinner plans change and I need something good that can be prepared in about twenty minutes.Unfortunately, my local supermarkets chose to stock three types of au gratin mix and not the Hash Browns. Thanks to Amazon, I can still buy them.

review/summary: My dog loves it!
review/text: We just recently added a corgi to our family, and I started researching different types of wet and dry foods for our pup. After trying different raw diets, we eventually settled on the Weruva brand of dog food. Our local pet store recommended it to us, and the girl working actually opened up a can and started eating it! It's processed in Thailand, and before that scares anybody, you have to realize that the food processing laws in Thailand are MUCH more strict than in America (read it up online!). They are not allowed to process by-product in their pet food, or use filler product. Weruva definitely does not have any of that--you can actually eat the dog food and it'll taste just like dinner.<br /><br />Our boy has a sensitive stomach and he's a very picky eater. The first night we got him the regular Chicken with Gravy he ate that whole can up. He loved it, and when we tried feeding him anything different he refused. Then we ordered him the Kobe Master flavor and it quickly became one of his favorites. I'd definitely recommend this brand, especially coming from a very concerned dog owner. I won't feed my dog anything else.

I'm saying all of this to say that she is super pickyk.  She'll only eat real chicken breast jerky, dingo brand bone with chicken in the middle, and the weruva brand wet food.  (And fresh vegies and fruit... mystery)  Anyhoo, of all the dog food/treat in the market, she LOVES this one the best.  That says a lot.

Weruva is one of the only genuinely human grade dog food products available.  My three pugs had totally gone off their food for days until I tried this brand .... I was going to buy Merrick (which they don't like very much) and found this instead.  It is spectacular.  Doesn't even smell like dogfood.  And, Amazon's price is very reasonable compared to my local retailer.  THIS IS A GREAT DOGFOOD PRODUCT and really worth trying out if you are an animal lover.  BTW - I now give it to my cats too and they are the fussiest eaters in the world -- they love it too.

She is a picky eater, and sometimes the other food, has to be put in the refrigerator because I don't want it to spoil. I don't give her this "flavor" all the time though, because I want it to be more of a reward type meal. Have not tried the Kobe flavors yet, but am looking forward to...am waiting for the economy to pick up a bit more to try these ones just in case she is not as crazy about these as she is the pork version.

review/text: This brand is not bad, the ingredients are all good. However, compared to Fromm's canned dog food, I was not impressed. There seemed to be more liquid in the can and the can was not as full. Also, my puppy's stool turned more runny after eating this. I did not have this problem with the Fromm's canned food which definitely was more solid and less liquid. I give the company credit for using quality ingredients but the food truly looked more watery and filled with liquid. Maybe that is good for cats but I tried their dog food for our puppy.  I will go back to Fromm's and exchange the remaining cans of Weruva.

review/summary: Good food, easy delivery
review/text: I have two small-ish dogs (both should weigh about 12-15 pounds each), who are 9 and 11 years old. Feeding them never used to be an issue; we used a nice quality dry food, and they ate out of one bowl together. A few years ago, though, one of them became dangerously ill, and is now diabetic with heavy cataracts in both eyes, so being sure she gets enough to eat at the right times has become much more important. I mix a quarter of a can with a half cup of our dry dog food for each dog twice a day. This gives both of them the right calories (the other dog is more plump because when food falls, she is the only one who can see it!), and the wet food ensures that my diabetic pup eats everything in her bowl. Amazon's price is better than what I pay locally, and it arrives sooner than what the delivery-by date is.

review/text: My pup, a corgi/chi mix who rarely gets people food yet somehow is so very picky, LOVES weruva. He has tried other very high quality brands and has now been turning his nose up to those after he has tried this. He has so far tried and loved the paw-lickin chicken, grandma's chicken soup, and wok the dog.  These are especially great if you like to have something to mix in with kibble because they have a good amount of sauce in it, though not too much in my opinion to feel like you're getting jipped.<br /><br />I have not yet purchased them from amazon so I cannot comment on the shipping quality.  Although I have bought online elsewhere and it arrived via fedex, some a little dented but all cans still useable.  Glad to see weruva is on amazon, will have to order from here next time I need to purchase.

review/summary: Excellent quality.  My dogs LOVE it!  =)
review/text: My Cavaliers absolutely love this product.  I give it to my nursing moms to keep weight on them.  Some of them tend to get picky when they're nursing, but this brand of food is always more than appreciated by my little mamas.  :) I would like to explain just a bit further.  My largest expense with my show dogs is for their top quality food, even more costly than our vet expenses!  If my spoiled fur family loves this food, I, for one, am convinced it's a top-notch product. I wish it were cheaper, but all things considered, it's an acceptable price for the quality.

review/summary: My saluki likes it well enough....but then she's a chow hound
review/text: I look for grain free food only as my sight hound is mostly raw meat fed.  In the AM she needs something to take up the extra bile her very acid belly produces.  I also need to mix her tick garlic tabs into something in order for her to eat them.  This does the trick as well as a couple other canned meat products do.

I also like to avoid raw hide since one of my previous dogs had stomach problems with raw hide.  I haven't noticed any issues with the ear pieces.<br />After looking at grocery and the pet store chains, this is a good price in comparison. I paid about $12 for the pound of Grillerz.

review/summary: Good for soapmaking
review/text: This coconut oil is perfect for soapmaking.  Anyone who has used coconut oil should know that it remains in a solid form if the temperature is under 76 degrees so I am not sure why that would be a negative.  I am also not concerned about the bottle;  it is perfectly sufficient.  I have also bought food grade lye from essential depot and the bottle does not have a problem holding that in so I'm not worried about the coconut oil leaking.  Overall it is a great product and fairly cheap for a large quantity of coconut oil.

review/text: Using the coconut oil is making my skin look great!  I wish it didn't harden below 76 degrees, especially in winter, but it turns back to liquid when you put the bottle in warm water for a little bit.  I've mixed it into homemade body wash with Dr Bronner's liquid soap, and it leaves my skin with a very moist feeling!  I also use it for chapstick; it's great that you can ingest it (from regular lip movement) without worrying about chemicals!  It's unscented, which makes it great for adding essential oils to.  Great price for the quantity!

review/text: I got this for soap making. I'm a beginner so I can't really say anything about the quality.<br /><br />I received my bottle today with it in solid form. Granted its around 45 degrees outside, so it was most likely becoming a solid. I guess I'll just have to keep it warm to let it go into liquid form.<br /><br />ALSO the biggest complaint I have besides it being in complete solid form is that there's a huge bubble meaning its definitely not a full one quart as advertised. On top of that the bottle seems incredibly cheap.<br /><br />We'll see how the quality is when I start making soap.

review/summary: Amazing customer service
review/text: When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert "3-4 mm" to inches and consequently discovered the "Coarse Grinder Salt" was almost 1/4" (1/6" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!

review/text: This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a "rounded" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.

review/summary: For more than salting foods.
review/text: Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron.

review/summary: super fast shipping, free samples
review/text: placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition, it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt, lemon citron flake salt, and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry, doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment).<br /><br />as far as product quality goes, i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet, but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping).

Why would you buy the one pound bag on something that never goes bad when you can get more than double for just a few dollars more.<br /><br />Dr. Mercola's comments regarding Himalaya salt benefits are what started me using this initially a few years ago. Many micronutrients, great purity. One person questioned the iodine: no salt naturally contains iodine unless it is iodized or contains some sort of seaweed. You can easily see his comments at mercola.com.<br /><br />Himalaya salt has a very 'clean' taste--add at the end of cooking.

In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.  If you're a neat freak, this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder.  Great salt and the bag lasts a long time.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: Just like in the store for a fraction of the price. I purchased this to refill my expensive pink salt grinder. A million times better than table salt. I don't know if it tastes any different from regular table salt but I think there is something about the shape of the crystals that changes the way the salt hits your tongue. If you have a good grinder I highly recommend checking this stuff out.

review/text: The bag was smaller than I expected, but that's probably just me being bad at estimating things.  The salt seems good, however, I was a little disappointed that the photo showed the salt to be much more vibrantly colored than they actually are.  I mean, they are pink, just not so bright pink as it shows.  The salt has a good flavor though.  I'd say it was worth the price.

review/text: Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon).

review/summary: SALT OF THE EARTH - Himalayan Style
review/text: Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.  So now, it's like buying a red, Ford Mustang.  It's all you see on the road or, in this case, on the shelves of the stores.<br /><br />I'm actually glad I purchased this and have stopped using regular old white salt almost totally.  The salt does seem to have a milder taste but I don't find myself using any more of it than I did with the good old "when it rains it pours" variety.<br /><br />Since ordering this from Amazon, I've managed to find some here in my little town but it is way expensive.  When you purchase this you will also need a salt grinder unless you like throwing big chunks of salt at your food.  Worth getting the two together, however, especially if you purchase a grinder with a glass container as the salt really looks attractive in a pretty, transparent grinder.  And, of course, it tastes good, too.  About it's nutritional value I admit to knowing zip.  Does salt HAVE nutritional value?  In the meantime, I give this four stars.  If I find out more about the actual food value I'll update this review.

review/summary: a WINNER in this coffee snob's book!!!
review/text: I take my coffee very seriously. So seriously to the point where I'm not one to even endorse the big name coffee giants that charge $8.00 for what tastes like a cup of warm milk and flavored syrup!!! That being said I was skeptical to buy this because I hadn't heard of it before and I like to smell and observe the texture of coffee before buying. But I gave it a shot because I needed something I could make everyday at the office. I am more than pleasantly surprised at the taste and quality of this coffee!!! It has a wonderful aroma and it is true to what it claims: It does make up to 10 cups of coffee per pack! It does not taste syrupy or leave a sugary aftertaste like some cheap flavored coffees. It's medium roast & very smooth...something a 1st time coffee drinker could enjoy as well as a pro. I absolutely love it and will definitely try it again. And I must say for the price, you really cant go wrong here. I'm on my way to ordering the hazelnut creme and the coconut. Once again, great price, great quality, excellent flavor! I would pay for this any day over some sugar-loaded, overpriced mochachococrappacino!!!

review/summary: Easy as Pie!
review/text: This pie crust mix is the easiest and most consistent I have used.  I love it.  I have been dealing with Celiac Disease for over 10 years.  I also live in a small rural community and can only get gluten free products with when going into Albuquerqe NM and visiting the health food store. Before my diagnosis I was a pie making queen (goddess if you will).  It was very hard to give up, but if you can't taste your wares, you loose all quality control.  I have experimented with different flours, tried different recipies and books everything.  This is the one that works the most like a typical pie crust.  This is my advice: 1) Use a hand mixer to cut in the shortening.  I don't know why it works, it wouldn't with regular flour, but it does.  2) Keep it in a ziploc bag at least over night.  The way the shortening combines with the dry ingredients overnight makes it much easier to work with.  3) Keep sweet rice flour, corn or potato starch on hand for rolling purposes, and roll it out using wax paper or foil.  I also prefer to make smaller tarts using a muffin pan just because rolling to that size is easiest and you can control serving size that way.  Good luck!

review/summary: Flaky pie crust
review/text: Learning to bake without gluten is a new process for me. I thought that working with the dough seemed more like making a cookie dough than rolling out a pie crust. Without gluten it lacks the elasticity that I am used to. Once I got the knack of working with the dough and doing some patching I was very pleased with the results. The flavor and appearance of the pie were not distinguishable from a crust made with wheat flour. In fact, the crust was flaky and even better than many pie crusts that I have eaten.

review/summary: Versatile and tasty mix
review/text: I have made one-crust pies with crumb topping, two-crust pies, quiches, and lemon squares with this wonderful, versatile mix.  It works well with my pastry recipes from former wheat-flour-eating days.  The crust is light and fragile, with very little grittiness (less than any other product I have tried thus far.)  Other family members not on a gluten-free diet happily eat items made with this Pie Crust mix and have requested the pies and lemon squares for family gatherings.  One suggestion for those wishing to make a two-crust pie: roll the top crust between two sheets of wax paper, peel off the top layer of wax paper, then carefully invert onto the pie and peel off the other sheet of wax paper so the crust doesn't break apart during handling.  Pieces that do break off will re-attach with your fingers.  Thanks for offering this superior product!

review/summary: Best gluten-free pie crust I've had!
review/text: I'm going to give this 5 stars, simply because it is the best gluten-free pie crust I've had. I've tried Whole Foods frozen crusts, and also made my own from scratch, both of which were so tough they couldn't be cut with a knife! I've also made crusts from gluten-free cookie crumbs which were actually very good. But for a rolled-out crust, this one so far is the very best. I did find that it required some patching, and after it was baked it tended to fall to pieces when cut. However, in my opinion that is much better than a tough crust, and is the sign of its tender, flakiness. I made mine with all butter because I did not have the butter-flavored shortening. The flavor was outstanding, and acutally tasted like a wheat crust. Kudos to Gluten-free pantry!

review/summary: LOVE TO MAKE SUGAR-FREE FLAKY "Pie Crust Cookies/Shortbread" with this mix
review/text: When I was growing up and Mom would make pie crusts, we would always take the trimmed off pieces and bake them as "pie crust cookies".<br /><br />I use this Gluten Free Pie Crust Mix to make "cookie/shortbread" because MANY of the GLuten Free Cookie/Cake Mixes already have sugar in them.<br /><br />I ALWAYS USE Coconut Oil instead of butter/margarine/shortening, which adds flavor and a bit of sweetness. I have sometimes used the Coconut Oil when it is melted, thinking, "Oh my, I ruined it," because then the mix becomes more runny than firm. Yet, when I added the liquids (cold water, "eggs" and Apple Cider Vinegar), the mix then becomes more firm and balls up. THe last time I made this, I only used a total of 15 tablespoons of the "butter/margarine/shortening" and this seems to make the cookies better to my taste.<br /><br />Since I am making cookies and not a Pie Crust, I do not chill the dough.<br /><br />I prepare the mix and press it into a 17.25"x 11.5"x1"cookie sheet.(parchment paper lined, optional)(Prepare cookie sheet as per your own needs for not sticking...)<br /><br />Then, I take a knife and gently cut the into preferred shapes before baking--square, rectangle or other.<br /><br />The oven I use cooks extra hot, so I adjust the temperature down and bake them, watching to make sure that they are light, golden brown without getting too browned.<br /><br />***********************************************************************<br /><br />That said, I like to experiment with how to add other flavors:<br /><br />Since I do not keep milk available, I just use 1 1/2 cups water and add other things to it for the flavor. To the water, I add double the amount of Vanilla Whey powder to make a strong flavor. Sometimes, I make a strong concentration of Blueberry Tea (4 or 6 tea bags per the 1 1/2 cups of "milk/liquid"). This creates lovely Blueberry flavor without Blueberries in the mix! OR try other tea blends/Chai flavors.<br /><br />While I am mixing the ingredients, I also add Four dropperfuls of Liquid Stevia as a sweetner (Optimum Nutrition's).<br /><br />You can add any flavors, nuts, chips, etc. as you can imagine. And even top each little cookie with some spread, frosting, nut, chip or other.<br /><br />************************************************************<br /><br />Sometimes for a topping/spread, I combine Coconut Oil and Almond Butter.<br /><br />There are Infinite Ways to play with this mix and make it your own.<br /><br />I hope this sparks other ways for you to enjoy and appreciate this wonderful Perfect Pie Crust Mix. Try something out and share your comments with the rest of us.<br /><br />BLessings always.

review/summary: Prefer Pamela's
review/text: Was out of Pamela's Bread Mix so picked up a box of this at a health food store.  With Pamela's I usually use the basic crust which is two, eight ounce sticks of butter and some water.  Held off my rating until I got another package of Pamela's and tried the flaky variant which is one, eight ounce stick of butter and eight ounces of shortening to compare the crusts.  GF pantry crust is definitely 'flakier' but not enough difference from Pamela's to sway me.  I'll stick to a "much less ingredient" mix but will buy more if I ever run out of Pamelas again.

No more crust-free pies for my husband - he thinks I'm trying to make him sick by feeding him the 'real' thing or he has died and gone to heaven.  He has to hide his dessert from everyone - including me - it's better than the traditional pie crusts and no kidding - easier to work with!  And it NEVER ends up in the trash like many of the other GF items we've tried.

You can always roll it out a few times before getting it right...the ONLY good thing about GF flour...you can work it several times and it does not change the consistency.  Enjoy

review/text: I followed the directions precisely but the end result was the same as using other pre-made GF crusts using a GF flour blend, palm shortening, ice water, salt. The crust looks and feels flaky, but when the fork hits your mouth, it dissolves into a grainy, pasty mush you either need to spit out or drink a glass of milk to get down.<br /><br />I don't know what needs to be added to give it the elasticity and ability to hold together, but whatever it is, this mix doesn't have it.

review/summary: Mix crust the day before
review/text: This mix created a lovely, delicate crust that I have used for both sweet and savory pies. I found that it works best if you double the amount of water, mix it the day before you use it, then rehydrate and roll. If you plan on using it the same day, don't, or you will have sand that doesn't roll out. The premixed crust also freezes very well, which is nice since each box really does make 4 single crusts.
