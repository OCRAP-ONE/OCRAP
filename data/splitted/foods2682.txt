review/summary: Not very good
review/text: I used to buy pistachios from The Nut Guys but they went out of business, so I decided to try these, in spite of the fact that there are really expensive, especially once you add the shipping. Unfortunately, these were not nearly as good. The taste was so-so, and the freshness was sub par. I hate to leave a bad review for a product made by a US farmer, I really do. But at this price, I feel like it just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />To be fair, I bought these in the winter, so maybe that explains the lack of freshness? But if that's the case, I might as well buy the cheap nuts at my local Costco. Very disappointed.

review/text: Our family is gluten-free and sugar-free (and some are dairy-free).  We recently discovered these and love them!  Not really like a cookie as we used to know them, but still a fun treat.  They're crunchy but have a great chocolatey-coconutty taste.  Our whole family likes them, including my husband, 5yo son & 1yo son.  This is the best price as compared to our local health food stores as well as local grocery store.  Especially if you do suscribe & save.

review/summary: WONDERFUL!
review/text: My husband is diabetic and I have a passion for decorating cakes. For months I had been struggling to find a frosting that wouldn't put my husband in danger. I had seen this here on Amazon but was not willing to pay $30 for something that may not work, tasted bad, or would end up runny.<br /><br />It seemed so foreign to me as a cake decorator to "just add water" to frosting, but I followed the instructions and was pleased that when it was done that it at least resembled frosting. I was concerned about the consistency since the cover pic looked like all you could do with it was smear it across the cake. Feeling a tad disappointed that it was not stiffer, I covered it and put it in the fridge for a couple of days. I had been trying to make a cake for my Hubby from the Sweet 'N Low "Yellow" cake (it still looked white) since he has been suffering through me working on practice cakes in preparation for doing his sister's wedding cake next month. I had held onto the very tiny hope that the Sugar Free frosting could actually be decorated with like a real cake.<br /><br />IT WORKED! After the two days I pulled the frosting out of the fridge and immediately re-whipped it and iced the cake, then put it in a frosting bag with a star tip. My shell borders came out perfect! It is really smooth and firm as long as it stays cold, then it works like buttercream!<br /><br />Hubby LOVED it and would have eaten it all at once if I hadn't made sure he didn't. He was really impressed that he got a 'real' cake.<br /><br />I am not a huge chocolate fan, nor do I like the chemical taste of a lot of sugar free foods, but even I liked how it tasted! It just tastes like a good milk chocolate frosting. Yummy! Just keep the cake refrigerated and the icing will stay firm. Next time I think I'll try a wider variety of tips, but I'm sure it should work just fine! I just hope the white frosting turns out as well!

The pretzels are pressed flat, like crackers, and are sturdy enough to use for dips or topped with cheese. They are the perfect combination of the pretzel and the cracker.<br /><br />I tried several of the flavors and it really hard picking a favorite as all the flavors went over well in my house. Pretzel Crisps are the perfect snack for those of us looking for a healthy, delicious alternative to chips.<br /><br /> I have tried them with soup, with dips, and covered in chocolate. (Chocolate? There went the healthy part.)<br /><br />My only fault I have is I find them quite addicting. They are so good, it's hard to stop at eating just a few.

When I first tried this, Thin Mints was the first thing to come to my mind, because the taste of chocolate, flour, and mint make for an awesome flavor. If you're a fan of Thin Mints or just mint-flavored stuff in general, give Mint Oreos a try, you won't be disappointed! And the mint filling is great to lick off the cookie! Yum!

review/summary: Addicting!
review/text: After buying Cool Mint Oreos from my grocery store (and they're never hard to find), eating a regular oreo just doesn't seem to cut it anymore! My husband hates this kind, but I think he's crazy. I really have to watch myself with these cookies. They are creamier than the original (hence the double-stuff), and 2 of these cookies have about the same amount of calories as 3 of the original. Recently I've found oreos to be too sweet and dry, but these are certainly an exception. The mint and creamy filling really seem to cut the sweetness. They're so good, the glass of milk is optional. Some mint-flavored products taste artificial and have a chemical taste to them (think McD's Shamrock Shakes, Necco Thin Mints, or toothpaste). Not these! The flavor comes from real peppermint oil. Though I wouldn't mind if the bright green coloring agents were omitted. Chocolate mint lovers, beware.

review/summary: keep on hand for sick cats
review/text: This is worth always having on hand in case your cat gets sick or can't eat because of a mouth injury, cancer, etc. Also stock up on oral syringes (the 3 milliliter size works well for cats' mouths). There are 33 calories per tablespoon, and it's very syringeable with 1:1 PDG:water mix (you can make it even more concentrated and still syringe it, but it's easier for the cat at 1:1). So I add a tbsp of water to a tbsp of PDG, and this fills about three 3 milliliter syringes. I feed about 1/2 milliliter at a time with no trouble (let the cat swallow and lick in between...), so in a few minutes I can get 33 calories into the cat with no fuss. An inactive small cat only needs about 4 to 5 times that much in a day. Some cats can eat up to 2 tbsp of PDG at a time. This works well when the cat isn't even able to eat baby food meat, and even when they can - it's good to supplement them with some syringe feeding to get both of you used to it and to get cat-specific good stuff into the cat. I don't restrain the cat, just put one hand on her shoulder and put the syringe up against her teeth, then when she opens her mouth I squirt about 1/2 milliliter into her, aiming toward the back of the mouth and to the side (don't want kitty to choke...). Just be gentle and you shouldn't need to do anything more than that. You also should try the PDG/water mix in a little bowl, some cats will lick that up all by themselves. Whenever syringe feeding, it's a good idea to have easily eatable food right there also, since sometimes cats just need a little jump start with syringe feeding and then they'll eat on their own. It takes energy to eat, for one thing.<br /><br />Cats should never go more than 24 hours to 48 hours max without food- their livers aren't all that efficient and they can get very sick very quickly without food, toxins release too quickly from stored fat for the liver. Dogs and people are different, they can fast without harm. But cats can very quickly go off their feed for various reasons, even if their nose if just stuffed up from a cold (if they can't smell it, they don't want to eat it) or if they are uncomfortable for some other reason.

review/text: Our family is Gluten Free and this bullion and it's companion flavors has been so helpful. We eat a lot of soup in our house and this is a wonderful base to help fill out the flavors. It's hard to find a tasty, GF product that doesn't break the bank. This is so handy. Shelf stable, easy to use and really good. My whole family approves. Compared to what I was using before we went GF it's a super deal too. I love that Amazon has it in the auto-ship packages so I can stock up and save. I highly recommend.

review/text: Since our Albertsons doesn't carry them, I ordered here.<br />I make vegetable soup often with mostly ingredients I have bought thru Amazon. Libby's cans of mixed vegetables to start, plus I add a can of Libby's asparagus. And, of course, add several cubes of Herbox beef boullion.

review/text: I couldn't find this in my local stores so had to order online and am glad I did. It arrived promptly. I tried several GF beef boullions from the stores but they were bland and I couldn't find the flavor.  Herb ox is the only product that tastes like my old GF bullion. Thanks Herb ox for making a GF product.

review/summary: Run of the Mill
review/text: The problem is that when you tried the best, if only for one time, you start comparing all the rest to that high standard. I had better boullion and this one is average. It works in the sense that if you add a couple to clear water some sort of flavor will develop but to call this flavor a clean beef taste is pushing it. But I did wanted some alternative a little more economical so this is what I chose based on happy reviews. There is not one hint of an above average product so I am rating it with a 3 but to be fair a 3.5 could also work. For the money it gives a lot, for the flavor not so much.

review/summary: best boullion or bouillon i have purchsed
review/text: i use this for stews and a broth to cook rice and lentils. it is the best bouillon i have used in that the salt is not to dominating and the herbs (parsley) are a pleasant addition. add some celery and carrot to it and it is hard to go wrong. i will say that it is still a bouillon cube and not as good as a homemade stock or an upper end commercial stock. if you use this type of product you won't be disappointed it is great addition to any budget stricken, ten minute meal chef.<br /><br />TO AMAZON IT IS BOUILLON NOT BOULLION. try checking in one of the million dictionaries you sell or read the package before posting it on the site.

review/summary: It's milk
review/text: I am definitely happy with the purchase of this nonfat milk. After reading the directions, I was able to make the milk easily without any special utensils except a measuring cup. It tasted like nonfat milk after chilling it in the refridgerator. I am happy with the taste, and I don't think it will go to waste.<br /><br />I am a  bit concerned about the overall price. I seems like this will only make 3 gallons of milk, maybe 4. Even at 4 gallons of milk, it costs more than the milk at the store, and this is before the shipping cost. I don't think it's economical for regular use, but it is good in an emergency or if you are going camping. The expiration says it lasts almost 2 years in the powdered form on the bags I received.

review/summary: Heat with a citrus kick, minus the vinegar and artificial colors
review/text: I love that this Tabanero hot sauce actually has some flavor to it, and isn't just adding heat to a dish with a mix of peppers and vinegar. The sauces blend of habanero peppers carrots and lime juice (with a few other natural ingredients) give your dishes a hot kick with a zesty tang of citrus. Two of my favorite things about this sauce are actually the two things that are not added to it, artificial coloring and vinegar. I'm allergic to artificial colors and vinegar can often cause me to have an upset stomach. So now I can finally have the heat with out the other issues. You can taste the freshness of the natural ingredients and the lime juice adds a brightness to the hot flavor. Absolutely delicious and very highly recommended. A sample was provided by the manufacturer for review.

review/summary: Fresh taste & flavorful
review/text: I am so used to Tabasco that it is now tastes boring to me. I tried many kinds though; some are disappointingly watered down, while some are so fire hot but taste like synthetic or chemicals on the tongue.  I also have the inexpensive favorite Sriracha; the problem with that is it does clogs sometimes at the tip. This is closer to the consistency of Frank's RedHot, but a bit spicier.<br /><br />I like the kick and fresh flavor of this hot sauce.  Maybe the absence of vinegar really makes a difference.  The color is more like orange, which is similar to duck sauce. It goes well with pizza, lo mein, soups, and most meat.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This is a complimentary item sent to me for review.

review/summary: Great Flavor and Heat - Highly Recommended
review/text: This Tabanero "Hot Sauce Picante" has a wonderful natural flavor and a good amount of "heat". My family loves hot sauces, but our tolerance range from medium (my wife and son) to fairly hot (me and my daughter), and this is right on upper limit of medium.<br /><br />Some hot sauces are hot just for the sake of being hot, but this is also very flavorful and can be used to enhance salsas, dips, or other foods that could use some zing. I like that the ingredients are all natural, including Habanero peppers, carrots, onions, Key Lime juice, agave, garlic salt, and grapefruit seed extract. Note that this does not contain vinegar like most other hot sauces, and it doesn't miss it all. This has a great fresh pepper flavor that is slightly sweet tasting with a hint of carrot flavor coming through. The sauce has a nice consistency that makes it easy to see how much has been added to your food.<br /><br />It is important to shake the bottle well before serving since this has a tendency to separate, with the hot pepper component rising to the top. I didn't shake it before testing it on my finger tip and found it to quite potent, providing some amusement for my son.<br /><br />This is a very different and enjoyable hot sauce that provides both heat and flavor!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Hot and complex
review/text: i have to start by telling you that in recent years I've started putting hot sauce (previously Tobasco or similar products) on about 3/4 of the food I eat. I've found that hot along with sweet, sour or salty taste really good and add to the overall flavor. So I was happy to discover and try this Tabanero Hot Sauce Picante. This isn't your run-of-the-mill vinegar and cayenne hot sauce. It actually has some interesting and complex notes of lime, grapefruit, onions and garlic with just a hint of sweetness. (Sounds like a wine review, huh?) The actual ingredients are: select Habanero peppers, carrots, onions, Key Lime juice, agave, garlic salt and grapefruit seed extract. I like that these ingredients are all natural and there aren't any chemicals added or anything I don't recognize.  The Key Lime juice adds the tartness that I'm used to in Tobasco sauce, but has a much more interesting flavor. Although carrots are the second ingredient, I didn't specifically taste them, other than they probably add to some of the sweetness and mouthfeel and they certainly add to the color. Now, although I've mentioned sweetness, the overall flavor of this sauce is hot/sour with the sweetness being much more subtle, not something that jumps out at you like in a BBQ sauce.<br /><br />At first when I saw that this contained Habanero peppers I thought that it might be too hot. I don't like sauces that leave me in tears and that set my mouth on fire for half an hour after eating. But this sauce isn't like that. It's a little hotter than Tobasco but the ingredients other than the Habaneros even it out and give it a wonderful flavor. So I can still sprinkle it liberally on my food without the fear of serious mouth burns.<br /><br />So far I've used it on burritos, in an Indian dish with lentils and curry, on lemongrass chicken and on steamed broccoli. (I know the steamed broccoli sounds weird, but it's really good!)  I've added it to a bean salad with black, kidney, pinto and garbanzo beans with sweet corn, cilantro, lime juice and onions. I've also sprinkled it on popcorn.  I added a couple of tablespoons of this hot sauce to a fudge recipe. Sweet and hot and chocolate. Seriously good! And only 1 calorie per teaspoon - not the fudge, just the hot sauce. Hey, we gotta conserve where we can!<br /><br />I received a complementary bottle of this Tabanero Hot Sauce Picante from Tabanero for review. I'll be purchasing more when this bottle is empty.  Two thumbs up for a hot and tasty product!

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: We like to add some heat to our meals in my family.  We all grew up in Southern California where the spiciness of Mexican food is a big part of our diet.  We use a lot of powders in our recipes:  Since we like the taste of smokey peppers, we use a lot of chipotle powder when we cook.  We don't use as many bottled pepper sauces though, because they're usually either boring and disappointing (like the same-old-same-old you get from Tabasco) or they're insanely hot.  I like heat in my food, but I don't like the stupidity of the heat that you find in some of the smaller brands.  Those sauces seem to be designed for &uuml;ber macho guys who are compensating for something.<br /><br />So my fridge has half used bottles of Tabasco, Tapatillo, Chalupa, etc.  We use them sometimes, but never with much enthusiasm.  We usually turn to those sauces when we're too lazy to spice things up right or when we're out of a better ingredient.  With that in mind, I wasn't too eager to open up another bottle of hot sauce.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I don't know what I love more, what this IS or what it ISN'T.<br /><br />First of all, what this sauce IS, is an incredible balance between flavor and heat.  I wouldn't exactly call this "mild", but it's not overpoweringly hot at all.  It's a great way to add some spicy flavor to an unspiced food.  It also has a unique flavor all of its own that is really good.  The main ingredient (and the source of the color) is carrots.  That might sound weird, but it works very well.  There is also a strong layer of citrus that catches your attention right away (in a good way).  And probably best of all, what you don't taste is any vinegar.  I get so tired of the overwhelming vinegar flavor from Tabasco sauce that it really makes me discriminate against the entire category of bottled hot sauces.  Luckily the flavor of Tabanero is good enough that I can overcome this bias.<br /><br />Here's what I've tried it on so far:<br /><br />*  First of all, I just wanted to taste it but I didn't want to wreck a meal.  I decided just to sample it on something I already had in the fridge.  I was in a hurry and lazy (but curious), so I just grabbed a slice of deli cheddar cheese and shook a bunch of this on it.  I was really surprised and definitely hooked.<br /><br />*  Next I tried it on some grilled chicken.  I put it on the chicken while it was on the grill and then I put some more on once it was on my plate.  It changed the chicken to something else and it really created a new variety.  My grilled chicken has always been very good, but this made it even better.<br /><br />*  I also tried it on some pizza.  We got one of those take-home, bake it yourself Walmart pizzas.  They're pretty mediocre pizzas, but they're cheap and they require absolutely zero brain cells too cook (we were tired and it had been a long weekend already).  As I grabbed the bottle, I had to stop myself and ask what it was that I was trying to accomplish:  Was I about to drown this pizza with hot sauce so I'd kill my taste buds and not have to taste the pizza?  Because with enough of this sauce, that was definitely an option.  Or was I going to apply just enough to transform this pizza into something better and turn it into something delicious.  I decided to try for option #2 and see if it was possible.  If that didn't work, I could always escalate things and add more sauce.  I was really surprised though.  By adding just enough Tabenero sauce, I ended up really enjoying this lousy pizza and turning it into something that I was happy to be eating (except for the obvious nutritional shortcomings).<br /><br />Bottom line:  I don't like most pepper sauces, but I LOVE this Tabenero sauce.  When this bottle is gone, I'll buy a couple more so I'll have some in the fridge and a backup bottle in the pantry.  And I'll probably toss out some of those other bottles from the fridge, because they don't serve a purpose anymore.<br /><br />I was provided this item for review (thank you!!!).

review/summary: Pleasantly hot and fresh-tasting hot sauce
review/text: The initial taste of Tabanero Hot Sauce Piquante is the unique chili habanero flavor and then a fresh, bright taste from the key lime juice with a gentle undertone of sweetness from the carrots and agave and perhaps a slight saltiness.  The chilies quickly begin producing a pleasant heat that develops for a minute or two and then lingers in the mouth for about ten more minutes.<br /><br />I have other hot sauces made with habaneros, carrots, and lime juice but they also contain vinegar, which muddies up the clean citric acid sourness with acetic acid.  Tabanero tastes fresher and has a pleasant pulpy texture.<br /><br />Archaeological evidence shows that domesticated chili habanero fruit have been part of Mexican cuisine for more than 8,000 years.  This hot sauce is actually made down in Tabasco, where the tropical climate is well-suited for growing chilies.<br /><br />Habaneros rate 100,000 to 350,000 on the Scoville scale, among the hottest of peppers commonly found in the grocery store, with much more heat than the peppers commonly used for standard hot sauce.  Tabanero is hot enough that it needs to be kept away from the eyes and out of the reach of toddlers who may be attracted by the beautiful orange color.<br /><br />Ingredients:  select habanero peppers, carrots, onions, key lime juice, agave, garlic, salt and grapefruit seed extract.<br /><br />A sample of this product was provided for unbiased review.

review/summary: My New Favorite Hot Sauce
review/text: How do I put this nicely? Hrm, ...Tabanero makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZSYS">TABASCO</a> taste like spicy vinegar-water in comparison. I personally don't mind a bit of vinegar in my hot sauces, but Tabanero has opened my eyes to how good a hot sauce actually can be. Try tasting Tabasco next Tabanero, and I'd be surprised if you prefer the former.<br /><br />Tabanero is really more of a food than a condiment. The ingredients include habanero peppers, carrots, onions, Key Lime juice, agave nectar and garlic; and they taste fresh and delicious. The agave nectar doesn't make Tabanero Picante sauce too sweet and it compliments the fire of the habanero's nicely. In fact, in a very short time Tabanero has become the staple hot sauce in my home. It has enough kick to make my taste buds stand up and take notice, but is mild enough to be used in a variety of dishes. It goes great with the usual suspects--from nachos to most Mexican dishes--yet is so versatile that I enjoy it with omelets and stuffed peppers too. Added to soup, it gives it a certain extra "something". You may think me odd, but I like a swig right out of the bottle when in need of a quick pick-me-up.<br /><br />Tabanero has hit gold with what I consider the perfect blend of ingredients in a tasty, versatile picante sauce that packs just the right amount of heat. The all natural ingredients are a plus, just be sure to vigorously shake your bottle before serving for maximum flavor. Any self-respecting hot sauce enthusiast needs to give this product a try.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/summary: What a great find!
review/text: I'm not a big fan of Mexican hot sauces. Cholula and El Yucateco I have<br />an affinity for, but the rest of the offerings from south of the border<br />just dont ring the bell knowhudahmsayin?<br /><br />But this Tabanero is a total home run IMO. I love the fact that the producers<br />have gone totally natural with this sauce, no fillers at all.. and no vinegar<br />which is a major plus. They've substituted lime and grapefruit here for the<br />usually present vinegar and that makes it work really well on fish, pork, and<br />other light dishes where a mild citrus blast is warranted.<br /><br />Ingredients: Habanero and Tabasco Peppers, Carrots, Onions, Key Lime Juice,<br />Agave Nectar, Garlic, Salt, Grapefruit Extract. See, all natural. And all the<br />flavors are present with the exception of the Agave. It looks like and has the<br />consistency of a good Caribbean sauce like Matouk's, but the overriding citrus<br />gives this a totally unique flavor, with a very mild habanero burn.<br /><br />This is now my "go to" sauce for fish, and the pulpy blend mixes well with off<br />the shelf barbecue sauces to give a real boost to a rack of ribs or chicken.<br />5 Stars for the visuals, taste, and packaging. Well done!

I'd recommend this food for someone who wants a high-quality food for their puppy, but doesn't need grain-free.

review/summary: I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!
review/text: I bought this product after hearing the company's founder, Dr. Lindsey, being interviewed on the radio.  I was intrigued by the interview and did more research on him and the products.  I decided on the Power4 to start with, as it encompassed many of the Superfruits that supposedly helped with a number of the things I wanted to improve, into one supplement.  I have been following the directions, taking one ounce in the morning and one in the afternoon each day.  Many complained about the taste.  I personally did not find it all that bad...strong, but not disgusting.  In any case, it is an ounce at a time... not a big deal.<br /><br />I finished half of the bottle and was starting to wonder if it was doing anything or helping in any way.  As soon as I started to doubt it, I realized it was doing more for me than I expected.  It is supposed to help increase the health of your skin, nails, and hair.  For the last couple of weeks I have wondered why my nails all of the sudden look so great.  I never have any nails and now they are long and strong and it took me days to connect the two together.  I also usually break out during "that time of the month".  This past week, when I would normally be fighting with 10 pimples... I had 2.  My hair is less dry, and seems to be more manageable.<br />It also helps supports a healthy libido...something I have been lacking in the last year or so.  What a difference!  I'll leave it at that!<br /><br />As far as the immunity benefits, I'm generally very healthy so it is hard to give support for that.<br /><br />The best part of the supplement, and the biggest reason I was looking for something, it is helps with creating healthy energy and healthy sleep patterns.  The last week or two I have had been sleep than in my entire life and feel so much better during the day.  I still get the occasional "2am blahs" but it is not nearly as bad as I used to.  I'm sleeping, for the most part, through the night, having little to no trouble falling asleep.  I have the energy to get through even the longest days and seem to be in a much better mood than I have been over the last few years.<br /><br />All in all, I would highly recommend this product if you feel like something in your life is lacking.  I have always been a healthy eater, exercise regularly, but have been struggling with a number of things that this truly seems to be helping.  I will continue to buy and take this supplement for as long as I can!

This stuff has a bad taste but you know it's the real deal. No fruit juice and fillers. I'm used to taking ancient chinese herbal elixirs so this stuff is not that bad. Definitely recommend it to everyone!!

review/text: I beleave it has helped a bad shoulder pain I have had for 2 years after getting the shingles. The pain is minimal the past month compaired to the last few years. My mood is much better / love life. And my energy seems to have maxed, I can't do enouph in a day! I am 48 years old and I don't purchase something twice if I don't beleave in it, at $40 a bottle no way! Only reason for 4 star is I'm eating healthyer now, and want eat healthy. But this may have come from drinking this juice also? I drink 2 ounces in the morning half hour before I eat. (never take herbs or over the counter medication or vitimins (i don't beleave in them, never did) I say try it! But be real, nothing is going to happen overnight.

review/text: I drink mostly sencha tea. I bought this product hoping to find a low cost sencha that was still palatable. This tea was not good in any way. And I learned a valuable lesson: you cannot return grocery items through Amazon. Or at least that's what they told me when I tried to return it. This is a Chinese sencha and while there are many Chinese teas that I really like, I've yet to have sencha grown in China that was anywhere near as good as Japanese sencha.

review/text: I eat several varieties of the Think Thin bars, and they are a good, low carb snack.  This particular variety, while VERY tasty (not to mention a higher fiber count than the other varieties), is not sugar-free...it contains honey.  For anyone NOT doing a low carb diet, this may not be an issue; however, for low-carbers out there, you know that the carb count alone isn't enough.  You have to read the ingredients.  I was sooooo disappointed to see honey on the list.<br /><br />Oh, well...it was a nice, one-time indulgence.

This bar was a great substitute without the high sugar (his trigycerides were much too high) and now it's part of his daily food choices. No complaints about taste, the crunch and chocolate are very satisfying. Buying on the monthly plan is also cost effective as they can be costly bought individully at the store. In all, a win win.

review/text: I usually buy a few of these for $1.70 each. They are perfect for people on-the-go. I am an active person, always on my feet at work. This box works out great because I don't run out after a few days and its works out to be more economical than paying per bar. They taste delicious and are low in sugar, high in protein. In between work and school, eating one of these with a bottle of water holds me over until I can get home for dinner, because who in NYC can afford to buy dinner every damn night? They arrived a day late, but it perfect condition, no melting and just a few were broken in half, but that even happens at the store. Great product and great price.

I would rather pay more but get a fresh product. Why doesn't Amazon do something about this? I am not the first person to have had this experience. I didn't bother reading the reviews before I ordered them on my iPhone. Oh well. I hope they fix this or at least that others will read this!

review/summary: Good crunch and not too sweet
review/text: I like these bars because you get the crunch and flavor of a nut bar without too much sugar. They are peanut-y, without the weird texture and gross sweetness of other peanut butter protein bars. In my mind these are positives.<br /><br />Be prepared that there is not likely to be a large amount of chocolate coating on any given bar. The first time I bought one, I was disappointed when I opened it and compared the appearance of the actual bar to the picture on the packaging. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste so I decided to buy more.<br /><br />They can sometimes leave an impression of being a bit dry or gritty, which I suppose is due to the soy crisps or tapioca starch, or maybe just how dry my own mouth happens to be that day. I simply make sure I have a glass of water available when I plan to eat one of these.

Whole nuts and soy crisps and everything.<br />But for a meal replacement, it's too sweet.<br />It says to be 70% less sugared than leading fruit and nut bars. I wonder which bar it's reffering to? It's still pretty sweet. I'd call it sweet snack than meal replacement.<br />When I have less than satisfying meal, I would eat it for desert. For me it's canndy bar replacement.<br />I feel guilty eating it instead of a meal.<br /><br />Everything is laced with so much sugar now days, when I eat something for health, I want no sugar or very little sugar in it.<br />This bar would taste even better if it were less sweet.

review/summary: Stale nuts
review/text: I read a review, commenting that the nuts were stale.  I thought it might have been an one-time deal.  The nuts in my bars are stale as well.  The expiration is Feb 2013.  Even though grocery cannot be returned on Amazon, customer service refunded me without asking for return.  (When I checked at the store, where the bars have been fresh, the expiration is April 2013.)

review/summary: they love these
review/text: Two member of my family have celiac sprue and so we have been plunged into gluten free living over the past few years. Although these are not organic, my husband and daughter do like these to have a bit of variety in their lives. There are only so many Larabars one can eat in a lifetime. If you are looking for a good organic snack type product and have not yet discovered Orgain drinks, run there and order them immediately.<br /><br />I purchased several varieties of the Thinkthins when they were on promotion. Best price I have found.

review/summary: I Like These Bars But They Don't Like Me
review/text: I love the taste and texture of these bars; they're sweet, but not overly-sweet and have a satisfying, nutty crunch and just enough chocolate to make them interesting.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY, I apparently have a severe negative reaction to the artificial sweetener, maltitol, used in the chocolate coating.  About an hour and a half after eating one, my abdomen puffs up like a balloon filled with air, resulting in a very sore, achy feeling tummy and (excuse me) painful gas that lasts about three hours.<br /><br />Many people have this reaction to maltitol; if you're one of them, you'll have to learn, as I painfully have, to avoid anything that contains this sweetener.<br /><br />Hopefully, the company can make some maltitol-free versions of these bars in the future.

review/summary: Crunchy, chewy, salty & sweet...yummy!
review/text: Tastes like a Payday candy bar but with protein and a genuinely nutty taste.  These bars are great for on-the-go, in your handbag, purse, or backpack and actually fill you up with a bottle of water and an apple for a healthy meal.  I don't recommend refrigeration, as they are already chewy and don't need to be hard on top of that.  I recommend these bars for athletes, students, moms, and kids alike.  They taste great and are very satisfying.

review/summary: The best bar Think Thin makes
review/text: I have always longed for a real crunch in the Think Thin bars. Until this bar came along this sensation was lacking. This bar combines a darker chocolate with nuts in every bite. It's very tasty, and with the crunch, it satisfies one's chewing crave. I have bought this product by the bar in Trader Joe's but when I saw that Amazon sold it by the box, I jumped at the price point. I haven't had any of the shipping problems that other reviewers have mentioned. (Mine are shipped to Maryland.) I will definitely order these bars again. I use these bars are a meal replacement, especially at breakfast.

review/summary: Perfect Snack, Taste Great
review/text: The bar taste much better than many other bars I have tasted such as Odwalla and such. The chocolate is kept to a minimum to the bottom layer, and the nuts used in this product are a good mix with the chocolate. Overall, a very good bar and I would definitely subscribe on this item monthly.

review/text: This bar is the best tasting low sugar bar I've had.<br />I am however concerned about the Maltitol in the bar.<br />This substance is used as a sweetener and I think it's synthetic.<br />I've also read that it helps Aluminum cross the blood brain<br />barrier, yikes!  I really love these bars but I'm going to look<br />for something else, because of the Maltitol.  Honestly, I think<br />I'm just going to have to make my own.

review/summary: Love Think Thin Products, Esp This One!
review/text: The ThinkThin Crunch, Chocolate Dipped Mixed Nuts with Chocolate are delicious! If you are looking for something a little sweeter than the chocolate peanut butter bars, this one is an excellent choice.  Not as filling as the dense bars, but I still actually like the taste of these better.  (And I like the one's dipped in white chocolate too!)
