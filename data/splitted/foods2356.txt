review/summary: These taste awesome, and do the job!
review/text: After trying GU gel (which made me gag), I decided to try these beans. The watermelon flavor was awesome, no fake taste like the gels that I've tried. They go down as easy as regular jellybeans. Do drink with water though to prevent stomach upset (it tells you that on the box). I haven't had any problems with them at all, as long as I drink water. They give me the most energy of any I've tried, plus caffeine -- which I really need before a run (as I don't usually drink my daily coffee before running). I would definitely buy these again!

review/summary: Taste way better than GU
review/text: I tried this out when a friend of mine who worked at a running shoe store recommended me this.<br /><br />Comparing Sport beans with GU is like comparing Chipotle with Mikey D.<br /><br />I used this for a full marathon, hikes on Grand Canyon, Mt.

review/summary: Tasty, but not that useful for me
review/text: These are really tasty, and make a decent snack, but I've found that they aren't that helpful for running. When I'm doing a long run (10+ miles), they are too sweet, and leave my mouth feeling weird. I had also thought I was ordering the version w/ caffeine, but... appears not (mea culpa). Anyway, lastly, don't seem to give my system much of a boost, so... these go into the snack pile, but I'll not be using them for endurance sports.

review/summary: Awesome Recovery Tools
review/text: I had my reservations about this product when I first saw this product.  But being a big fan of Jelly Belly I had to try them.  I've used this product off and on for two years now.  I has helped me recover from training sessions.  Long runs, cross fit sessions, and field exercises that would have left me dehydrated for the day just become "fond" memories after taking one of these packs.  I do not recommend eating these Jelly Bellies unless your body needs the electrolytes, they taste too sweet and salty.

review/summary: Perfect For An Energy Boost
review/text: These are not just ordinary jelly beans (I know, I tried comparing). They are just the right amount to provide an energy boost, whether it be first thing in the morning, mid-afternoon to fight off food-coma (or meeting malaise), or even as a snack before dinner. I first started using them to supplement on the train to or from nighttime grad classes. They're also handy to have on hand between sets, quarters, or whatever your sporting needs might be. Quite tasty, too.

review/summary: Excellent Flavored Coffee
review/text: I am 67 years old and have never been a fan of flavored coffees, except for Irish Coffee and Coffee Amaretto, but I don't drink those anymore.<br />My daughter sent me a bag of The Bean Organic coffee flavored with Egg Nog, another favorite beverage I can't drink anymore.<br />While being skeptical, I decided to try it and to my suprise, I found I really liked it a lot.<br />The coffee has a rich full bodied taste without being bitter and it is easy to vary the strength by adjusting the amount of coffee used.<br />The egg nog flavor tastes like egg nog and is neither overpowering nor too sweet.<br />I made this my weekend coffee and I'm drinking the first mug from the last pot right now.<br />I transferred the coffee to a tight container to keep it fresh and it has held up very well.<br />I just added it to my wish list in the hope that another bag will find its way to my door.<br />I am also wondering how the pumpkin flavored and the cinnamon flavored coffees taste.<br />After drinking and enjoying the egg nog coffee I'm sure the others are excellent too.<br />Kudos to The Bean Coffee Company for a most enjoyable product.<br /><br />Tom<br />Penny Hill<br />Delaware

review/summary: Subtle, Lovely Bedtime Tea
review/text: *****<br />This Bedtime Tea from Yogi Tea is an herbal tea that is relaxing and a natural sleep aid. Bedtime Tea is made from organic licorice root, organic spearmint leaf, organic chamomile flower, organic skullcap leaf, organic cardamom seed, organic cinnamon bark, organic St. John's Wort leaf & flower, organic rose hips, natural orange flavor, valerian root extract, organic raspberry leaf, organic English lavender flower, steveia leaf, and passion flower extract. The taste is mild, delicious, herb-y, and very slightly sweet. It is subtle and lovely.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Bedtime Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Organic Bedtime tea is a safe, gentle and delicious way to help you get a restful night's sleep.Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) and other calming herbs included in this organic formula have been used for centuries to promote sleep without the risk of a morning "hangover" that can sometimes result from the use of drug products. This healing formula also includes Organic Chamomile (Matricaria recutita), which has been used for years by Western herbalists to soothe and relax and for its effectiveness in combating nervousness and restlessness. Mild relaxants such as Organic St. John's Wort and Passion Flower are also included in this formula. St. John's Wort is well known for its positive effects on mood, while Passion Flower, a Native American herb containing the naturally occurring chemical chrysina, a flavonoid, has been shown to help reduce nervousness and anxiety. This tea is also enhanced with Organic Skullcap, which has scutellarian, a plant compound that has been shown to help reduce anxiety. To help promote better and deeper sleep, health practitioners recommend avoiding caffeine products. Drink organic Bedtime tea before bed for a good night's sleep."<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that this tea is not to be used during pregnancy or while nursing. If you are taking MAO inhibitors or other prescription drugs, you should consult your physician or health care professional before use. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal.<br /><br />Best of all, it works...I love drinking it before bed to relax and drift off into blissful sleep. This is a great tea that I highly recommend.<br />*****

review/text: There needs to be a choice for ZERO stars.<br /><br />While the pictures are nice, and their website (www amazingclubs com) specifically bolds the statement that they have the "freshest and most mouth-watering desserts" it is the complete opposite. The first month we received dry brownies that were slightly smashed and crumbling. The second month was a small dry marble bundt cake (no way would it serve 8-12 even if you wanted to) and just now received white chocolate chip cookies that were (you guessed it) dry. Hard to believe that they are getting away with selling a dozen or so average-at-best brownies and a few more cookies for $28 a pop. This is a great racket for them, but hopefully I can post this review in enough places that they won't take anymore people in. Definitely NOT gourmet - do not order this.

review/summary: Yummy brownies
review/text: The gift I received from Amazing Clubs was phenomenal. I got a shipment of dessert brownies and they were delicious. They were packed in a red tin and were kept incredibly fresh. I got two kinds, one seemed to be a coconut brownie and the other double chocolate. The coconut brownie was so fudgey and the coconut spread was prepared perfectly. It matched the fudgeyness of the brownie and had a great flavor. I thought that the double chocolate ones were going to be dry because I waited to eat them, but to my surprise they were just as good as the coconut ones. I received my shipment right on time and in perfect condition. I even called to inquire about when I would receive my gift, and customer service was able to track my order and give me a delivery date, not to mention they explained how my gift would be selected. I would highly recommend the brownies, they make a great gift and for someone looking for new gift ideas, Amazing Clubs is a great resource. Although most of these gifts I would probably take for myself before I could gift them. I cannot wait for my next shipment to see what I get next! Great gifts for a fair price.

review/summary: Disappointing Desserts
review/text: For Christmas, I was given the very generous gift of 6 months of Amazing Clubs "Dessert of the Month."  Overall, I was extremely disappointed in the professionalism of the company, particularly given how much my relative invested in what was truly a thoughtful and unique gift. The company does not provide either nutrition information or, perhaps more importantly, a list of ingredients, for most of their desserts. This can pose a serious risk to individuals with any food allergy.  Upon requesting such information,  I was simply told, and I quote: "We choose not to disclose our vendor's information to keep our clubs exclusive and a continuous surprise for our members." Of the six months of dessert we received, three desserts arrived with issues. We received a mango tart in dry ice that had clearly melted/evaporated. Since I didn't have the list of ingredients, nor any knowledge of how long it had been sitting "unrefrigerated," I had to throw the entire tart out. We received a cheese cake in the same state.  Cookies were shipped, one month, and upon receipt they were dry, and every one was broken and crumbling. This is not to say that every dessert was bad. We got two months of brownies (which were superb) and one month of a coffee cake (which did come with nutrition info/ingredients).  Dessert products aside, the shipments were always on time. While the company offers a wide variety of other clubs to try, given my experience with the Dessert of the Month club, I would be very hesitant to try any of the other options.

review/summary: delicious in most iced drinks, a little tricky to make, worth the effort; too much in this package
review/text: If you follow the instructions on cooking boba/tapioca/bubble tea, the consistency and taste is amazing. The only downside is that the pearls tend to crumble in the bag and are generally fragile before they begin to cook and darken. Also, if the water is not hot enough in the beginning, you get the same problem of the pearls dissolving and things getting a bit messy and/or sticky. If you are patient and dedicated, these are the best choice, but if you want a simpler alternative, try the black minute pearls instead. Less delicate, easy to make, and just as tasty in the end, they are a lovely alternative. It's your choice, though. Either way, boba/tapioca pearls are a deliciously addictive addition to most iced drinks, especially milk teas, but also quite a few juices.<br /><br />As for the quantity, unless you own a store that makes boba, this would be too much, especially considering the crumbling that happens at the bottom of the bag. By the weight alone, you'll be left with a lot of powder in the bottom, especially if you handle it often.

review/text: I've had this sauce; it's the only one my butcher sells.  I'm not a bbq sauce expert, and of course any premade sauce is going to be lacking in one way or another.  However, I find this one to be highly adaptable, not too heavy, but still good at adding the right sort of flavor you want in a slightly sweet, slightly vinegary, red bbq sauce.  This isn't the syrupy thick sort of coating, it's a bit lighter.  I particularly like it as a sauce for crockpot meat, which is super easy.  It seems to tenderize the meat as well.

Plus its not full of crazy you can't pronounce fillers and corn syrup. Because of that it is quite runny, but I have used it straight up barbecue and brushed a few coats on. This is also great in the crock pot as well. You will like this stuff, I assure you.

If you are thinking of using this as a condiment, think again. This is really only good for soaking, prepping meat that is going to be put on the grill. As a BBQ sauce goes I would put it up there with most store bought brands. This is not worth the price tag.

review/summary: Best bottled sauce I've ever had!
review/text: My husband and I have been making our own sauce for years because bottled sauces are so lame, but we think the alla vodka pasta sauce is fabulous.  It was being sampled at a grocery store so I tried it and I couldn't believe how much flavor it has.  Try it--you'll like it!

review/summary: Tasteless and bland. A disappointment
review/text: Thin, tasteless and boring. That pretty much describes this sauce (and the other sauces by this brand). It's so bad I'm shocked that Mario Batali put is name on this!<br /><br />The Pros: The sauce has a nice color and a nice texture with some chunkier peices in it.<br /><br />The Cons: The sauce is tasteless and in between the chunkier bits it doesn't cling well to the pasta. You can see bits of garlic, onion in the sauce but the flavor has been completely boiled out of it to point that all that's left the bitter part of the garlic and the acidic part of the tomatoes. To say the flavors don't blend is an understatement. There aren't any flavors to blend in the first place.<br /><br />I would be embarrassed to be Mario Batali right now. Obviously he has traded his expertise and food quality for the money making machine.<br /><br />I severed this my boyfiend and we all agreed it wasn't a good sauce and would rather eat pasta plain than suffer through this sauce again. Such a disappointment.

review/summary: Works like a charm...just don't breathe it.
review/text: I make jerky as a hobby, and before I got this I'd get the actual Habanero peppers.  Buying this powder, however, has made things a lot easier and a lot more uniform between batches.<br /><br />A slight bit of warning...don't breathe this stuff.<br /><br />Yes, I know, you're thinking "but...how does it smell?  Is this going to impart off-flavors into whatever I put it in?  Maybe just a quick sniff.  I won't inhale."<br /><br />Yeah, it's like being maced.  While I was at work, without thinking, I went ahead and pulled off the foil seal under the cap, and a tiny puff...so small you couldn't see it...wafted up towards my face.<br /><br />I instantly rethought my life choices and immediately debated purchasing some sort of chemical filtration/rebreather system for future uses...and I have these same thoughts whenever I reach in and pull out a 1/4th teaspoon dollop for my batch of jerky.<br /><br />This powder is *fantastic*...no off flavors and it brings the heat!

review/summary: &iexcl;Caramba!
review/text: I bought this powder for my famous Vegetarian Enchiladas, and I must admit it has certainly made them more interesting.  In my revised recipe, I find that the complex flavonoids in Sonoran Spice Habenero Powder (1 lb serving) enhance the umami from the main constituent (Brussels Sprouts) while balancing the texture of my Hand-Formed Diatomaceous Tortillas.  Since I started cooking with Sonoran Spice Habanero Powder (1 lb serving), the members of my group have enjoyed them immensely.  We have taken to mixing margaritas and bursting pinatas until the wee hours of the morning.  I have developed a keen interest in landscape maintenance.  I nap easily in the afternoon, cry when I play guitar, appreciate full-figured women, and am more adept at climbing fences and swimming through swift currents.  My mustache is thicker, and I'm a more passionate lover.<br /><br />But the best part is the deeper connections I have formed with my extended family - thirty-seven of whom now live in my apartment.<br /><br />Buy Sonoran Spice Habanero Powder (1 lb serving) - it will change your life!<br /><br />&iexcl;Espero que esto ayude!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CDEPD">Rodelle Organic Pure Vanilla Extract, 4-Ounce</a><br /><br />This is the best Organic vanilla I have found. It has a rich taste that really comes through in my baking. After trying Rodelle, I realized how watery-tasting other vanilla extracts can be. And the price is not far off from conventional store brands. I bake on a regular basis and Rodelle is the only vanilla I buy. They also make a killer vanilla sugar that is my favorite thing to put in coffee.

review/text: First found this brand in a grocery store.  Was suprised to see this large of a bottle for the price for real vanilla.  Bought it and have not used another brand since.  It's very good real pure vanilla flavor.  Very strong as it is only vanilla in alcohol, comparable to a pure Mexican vanilla, with no sugars added.  Glad to see it on Amazon.

review/summary: GREAT Vanilla Taste
review/text: I tried this vanilla on the recommendation of a friend at work, and I love it!  I think it has a great vanilla taste.  I was worried about using something different, as I am a McCormick kind-of-baker, and I haven't ever deviated from it.  I tried it in a round of cupcakes that I was making for Mother's Day, and the taste of the cupcakes were amazing!!  I think Rodelle's Vanilla Extract had such a stronger, more flavorful taste than McCormick.  Some people say some of these other brands aren't as strong as the mainstream brands, but Rodelle has a wonderful product!!  This is the only product of Rodelle's that I have used so far.  Normally during the summer months, I make homemade ice cream.  I can't wait to use their whole vanilla beans, as I am excited to see how the ice cream turns out!!  I just wish I could find the beans in our local supermarket!!

review/text: Probably the best vanilla I've ever used. However beware that if you are not used to using a quality product you may be surprised at the rich vanilla flavor it presents in your recipes. Using the same amount of this vanilla compared to other brands I've tried actually changed the way I put together some recipes. At times I've needed to reduce the amount of vanilla so the flavor didnt take over. Its absolutely the richest most pure vanilla flavor I've ever experienced. Will never be without this brand of vanilla.

review/text: I love the taste of vanilla.  In fact, I enjoy it so much that I often found myself doubling the amount called for in several of my dessert recipes.  With Rodelle Pure Vanilla extract I find that I don't need to do that.  The flavor is strong enough that the quantity called for flavors my baked goods "just right".  Personally, I love to add a dash of cinnamon and Rodelle Vanilla to my waffles.  Nothing beats the taste for our family when we're having a big family breakfast.  (Add in a cup of coffee flavored with a some Rodelle Vanilla Sugar and I'm in heaven.)

By the time I had finished that first bottle, I was hooked on the wonderful flavor of this vanilla.

Great job, Rodelle!  I will never go back to the others!

review/summary: Rodelle Vanilla - Great Taste, Great Price
review/text: I first found the Rodelle brand about six years ago when I was doing a lot of baking and ice cream making.  I was shocked at how inexpensive a "pure" vanilla was and thought sure it was a weak version of "pure" vanilla.  Well, to my surprise it was not!  Rodelle is not some off brand, low quality product.  I highly recommend it for all your baking needs.  I used double the amount of vanilla I use in a recipe when I used another brand, I don't have to do that with Rodelle.  So not only is it a richer flavor, so I'm not using as much as I would with the other brand, it's cheaper than the other brand. The next time I went to the store I bought 2 more bottles, plus a couple bottles of their vanilla beans - which by the way is simply delicious in homemade vanilla ice cream.  This was almost six years ago, and I still find they have the best price for QUALITY pure vanilla.

review/text: I used to buy large bottles of vanilla extract at Sams because the price was so much less than the brand at the supermarket but I thought the flavor was lacking (this was real vanilla, not the artificial stuff).<br /><br />I recently starting making my own ice cream and I wanted the best ingredients. I bought and used the Rodelle vanilla.  Everyone agreed: the ice cream came out incredibly tasty with a great vanilla flavor (I didn't use vanilla beans).<br /><br />I will never buy by price alone. If you value the results, buy the best.

review/text: First of all, the product does not look as pictured online.  The label is different.  Because I was thinking I was getting a new and different product from what I had in my cupboard, I ordered it, but alas, when it came it was the same Rodelle vanilla I've used in a 16 oz. bottle for the past 5 years with the same, to my eyes, tired label.  This vanilla is labeled "bourbon".  What is that all about?  I'm simply annoyed.  My old Rodelle with the same label, is not sub-labeled "bourbon".  This new stuff smells like vanilla, but who knows what someone has fiddled with in manufacturing this product.<br /><br />Do not order this vanilla if you want truth in advertising. I'll probably use it, but don't trust Amazon with aromatic extracts.

I use it for my BBQ or grilled chicken and pork, it's  a good sauce for that, but not much more. Lastly, it's not that "hot" of a sauce, just a nice chipotle/ smoke flavor

review/summary: I liked it at first...
review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/text: Mild taste. Just add some honey and it's just like any other mild tea you would buy. Supposed to be great for allergies and Stomach bloat after drinking/eating poorly, noticed it does calm my stomach down and aid in flattening the post drinking bloat. Worth it! Try to drink a cup before bed each night! Caffeine free!

review/summary: Great flavored tea
review/text: This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online.

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/text: This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store, so I bought it online. Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one. It tastes ok. Not great. But drinkable.<br />I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!
