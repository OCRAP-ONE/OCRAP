review/summary: Best darn pretzels, GF or not
review/text: These are the best pretzels we've ever eaten, and by far the best tasting gluten free product.  My family loves these, and it's only my son who has to eat gluten free.  It's nice to be able to give my son something that I don't feel like is a lesser product taste-wise than the "regular" version.  So glad to be able to buy them by the case since they are hard to find in stores.  The pretzel sticks seem to taste better than the traditional shaped pretzels--don't know why--could be mental on my part.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: My nephew is a picky eater. He would only eat cheddar goldfish. Recently, he was put on a gluten free diet and we were worried that we wouldn't be able to satisfy his cravings for something crunchy but gluten free. We started experimenting with all kinds of snacks and he hated pretty much everything. When he tried these pretzels, he wouldn't put them down. He won't even share!! They are delicious and he doesn't even ask for the goldfish anymore.

review/text: My kids were pretzels addicts before being finding out they had a wheat intolerance, so these pretzels were one of our first gluten-free purchases.  Many gluten-free products don't live up to their gluten filled counterparts, but these certainly do.  The kids loved them, and so do I.  We now keep them as a staple in our pantry.

review/summary: Great deal on best GF pretzels I've found!
review/text: I fell in love with Glutino stick pretzels when I started a gluten-free diet six months ago. I actually think they taste better than the regular pretzels I used to eat! The only downside was the price -- the local store charged $8.99 per 14 ounce bag. When I checked on Amazon, I was pleased to find they carry Glutino pretzels. Interestingly, the 8 ounce bags turn out to be a better price per ounce than the 14 ounce ones, so that's what I ordered. With the subscribe and save deal, the 8-ounce bags came out at just over $3 apiece. If you or your gluten-free child loves pretzels for a snack, and you have the space to store a dozen bags, this is an awesome deal! I have a handful of friends who also are gluten-free, so I've shared some of my order with them. These are amazingly good pretzels and Amazon's subscribe and save price is the best you're going to find anywhere!!

review/summary: Get these if need a POWERFUL LAXATIVE
review/text: I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch.  They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects.  Within about 7 hours after eating these my stomach started feeling awkward.  Shortly after I started having cramps and severe watery diarrhea several times throughout the evening and late night.  Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum.  The package I purchased said cellulose gum on the ingredients list, but on the web sites it is listed as carboxymethylcellulose.  You will find they are synonyms if you Google them.  All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping.  If you look up this ingredient, or look it up along with "side effects" you will find it is undigestible and can cause side effects such as bloating and diarrhea.  Never again.  All I can say is please post a review if this happened to you to others are forewarned!

review/text: As far as the product goes - these are excellent.  Can't even tell they're gluten free.  Nice and crispy and good flavor.  Usually they're packed well but the boxed was partially crushed on this last shipment and half the pretzels were broken. They had slapped a shipping label right over the "fragile" that was printed on the box.  Not good thinking.

review/summary: Awesome snack choice for Celiacs
review/text: I bought these pretzels for my dad, who suffers from Celiac disease and Type 1 diabetes. He has a hard time keeping any weight on due his restricted diet, and often resorts to potato chips for his sole source of carbs between meals. He absolutely loves these pretzels, and said he enjoys them more than the regular kinds. I think they taste excellent, with that very slight "burnt" flavor that makes pretzels so good. They also seem to have a delicious buttery aftertaste IMO. Plus, they're very satisfying and healthier than potato chips.

review/text: I love these pretzels.  They are just hard to find.  I think pretzels have too much salt on them and I am always trying to scratch off the salt with my finger nails or a knife or something.  Even if I wasn't trying to watch my salt intake I try to take the salt off because they just put too much salt on pretzels.  These pretzels are really very good tasting.  I was afraid because they are gluten free they wouldn't taste very good because a lot of the gluten free products you sacrifice taste.  But not with these.  These are very close to regular pretzels and I am so glad they come in salt free.  I buy them by the case.

Then they quickly dissolve; not very quickly, just more quickly than "real" pretzels.<br /><br />So far Snyder's gluten free pretzels are the closest thing to "real" pretzels I have tried yet. I just wish they were made in twists.

review/text: These pretzels have been a wonderful treat since discovering I am gluten sensitive, but at 6 grams of fat a serving you need to be careful of how many you eat!  Would rate them at five stars if they contained less fat, but then they might not be as yummy...

review/summary: Glutino Gluten Free Pretzels
review/text: If you Celiac or just perfer gluton-free, these pretzels are a good substitution for both other pretzels and other types of snacks. Despite what O'Reilly used as a tip at the end of his show, gluten-free usually mean more "carbs" for a similar serving.<br /> But as a Celiac, varity is truly the spice of life. Celiacs first response to diagnosis is to see all the walls between them and what used to be their favorite foods. Celiacs in this day and age are so much luckier than previous generations. Firstly, because Doctors are running the proper blood tests to diagnosis gluten-intolerance much more frequently. It might appear as if more folks are stricken with this these days, but I am convinced that is just because of this increased knowlegde by the Doctors.<br /> As to these pretzels. They may or may not strike you as better than your previous favorite, but you now understand that the previous favorite were the cause of "palor", malnutrision and gastro issues. So you must resign yourself to exploring the every expanding gluten-free offerings.<br /> These are not your Philly soft pretzels, but they make a great salty and crunchy "chip" with which to scoop up some hummus, peanutbutter, etc.<br /> Also, this size bag and the Amazon price for a box of these every month or two is one of the most affordable ways to enjoy these healthful snacks. They also good straight from the bag, but it easy to get carried away.<br /> My wife and I found out about my Celiac 5 years ago. It makes you read everylabel on every product you bring into your house. You may even go as far a throwing out all porous (i.e. wooden) utensils, your old toaster and several other things and can't be guaranteed sanitazied.<br /> You learn to trust mostly the food you make yourself, but when you learn that you can trust Glutino, and you can, subscribe to Amazon for regularly scheduled deliveries of all types of life giving goodies like the Pamela's Pancake Mix which go great with chopped, toasted walnuts, blueberries and a couple of raisins although, most maple, agava and other syrups are still safe.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8HY">Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists, 14.1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: These are the BEST gluten free pretzels
review/text: My wife and children are gluten intolerant and we searched for good pretzels for a long time. We finally found Glutino a few years ago and then began the quest of buying them at a reasonable price. Amazon S&S is the perfect place to find them at a good price per bag or price per ounce compared to a lot of grocery stores.<br /><br />These pretzels are so good I usually don't buy regular pretzels anymore and just eat a couple of these when I want to eat pretzels.<br /><br />If I had to make any negative comment it would be that they could probably use a little more salt.

review/summary: Wonderful Treat - Better Than Non-Gluten Pretzels
review/text: Not only is this snack delicious but it's one of the first items to be even better than regular pretzels that have wheat.  The recipe produces a light and very crispy pretzel, doesn't get stale after leaving it a month in ziploc like other pretzels.  Everyone that I've shared with agrees with me.  So it is very expensive though for those who cannot eat gluten, it's a must have.  I buy it by the case and sparingly share with others!

I had been getting them from my grocery store, but they are rather expensive, so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon for a less expensive price and I was able to get them for even less when I got them on auto-ship.  These pretzels are my main snack food and even my family loves them.  I would highly recommend them.

She even packed up some to take with her after tasting them. She was surprised, because she thought they were going to be salty - like "normal" pretzels.

review/text: These are my favorite of the gluten free pretezels but they are expensive. So I decided to order a case from Amazon. I was VERY disappointed when the package arrived. They sent the regular pretzels and further the order said no returns. I called and they did refund my money but did not offer to send me the right product. I would rather have had the sesame pretzel rings I ordered. I won't order anything else bulk from here. I have had such good luck ordering from Amazon I was really disappointed with this order and Amazon :(  I gave a one star on the review because I did not get the product I ordered. The pretzels are a 5 star in my book.

review/text: I recently discovered these at a local Walmart priced at about $5 or $6 a bag (about 4 servings).  I decided to check on Amazon and loved the lower price.  A case of 12 bags for about $31.  I have not been diagnosed with Celiac disease (so far), but I am very sensitive to gluten and to oats (migraines, intestinal pains, diarrhea).  These pretzels have never once caused a reaction of any kind , even if I pig out on an entire bag in one weekend.  The only negative thing I could say is that the fat count in higher than I'd like. 8 grams for 32 pretzels.  Salt content is moderately high at 540mg, but they are pretzels after all.  I highly, highly recommend these pretzels.

The Glutino Pretzels are the perfect thing.<br /><br />The taste is very close to a regular pretzel--perhaps more like a slightly stale regular pretzel.<br /><br />The subscribe and save option here on amazon makes these significantly less expensive than they are in stores.

review/summary: Where have all the pretzels gone?
review/text: I recently purchased the 20-pack of 2.6 oz. bags of Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists. They are excellent and my family agrees! The 2.6 oz. bag makes it easy to control portions for those who (like me) are on a restricted diet. Unfortunately, when I tried to re-order within the last week, they are not available or no longer stocked. Upon searching for other suppliers, I found a few who have these available. However, they are available at a higher price than on Amazon. I already consider these great tasting pretzels to be a splurge item - if you do the math you find they are a little pricey for a snack item, even at Amazon's price. I truly hope these Glutino gluten-free pretzels will soon become available. I had planned to buy them again and again. They are a good-tasting, crisp and crunchy, very satisfying snack food.

review/summary: I Take These to Family Parties!
review/text: Once my family tasted these at a party I threw, they love it when I bring them to their house to share for gatherings. Every person that has tried them, LOVE them. Very dense, crisp and satisfying you will not know they are gluten free--you'll just know they taste better than the rest. For those of us that are used to paying prices for GF food, these are not that far off. I also tend to savor them more, knowing they are a bit more costly than the rest.

review/text: My 4 year old loves these pretzels.  They have a sweet salty taste.  We use them as snacks and in recipes.  They do have more fat content than most pretzels.  Not a big deal for a kid though!  Best price is on Amazon with the discount and free shipping.  Grocery store sells them for ~$7.59.

review/summary: Delicious & Low-Carb, but Pricey
review/text: Having lost 15 lbs in the past 2 months on a low-carb diet, I use a number of weight-loss products regularly. These dark-chocolate covered sunflower seeds are 100 calories of rich chocolate flavor, and surprisingly low carb.<br /><br />You get .67 oz per serving. At the price, I am tempted to buy them in bulk and measuring them out into snack bags... Of course, the sealed nature of these little bags keep me from cheating...<br /><br />See my other reviews for opinions on more low-carb chocolate-based diet meal-replacement bars and snacks.

review/summary: FANTASTIC!!!
review/text: Anyone who does not have access to large grocery stores that specialize in specific foods of various culturs knows how difficult it can be to find the necessary items for even common dishes.  Buccatini pasta is one of those items that can cost around 10.00 per pound after shipping is added to the total cost.  This product tastes great and fits into my buget.  Buccatini is the type of pasta that must be served with Amatriciana.  There can be no substitutes.  Thanks amazon you have made my friends and family very happy!

review/text: I have such fond memories of my grandmother using bucatini in a soup with veggies as lunch during Lent.  Unfortunately I haven't been able to find it in local grocers, so couldn't recreate her dish.  Imagine my surprise when I found it on Amazon.  I had no idea they sell foodstuffs until my friend said she'd bought something she was looking for.  I think it will take me quite a bit of time to eat the whole case, but it was a good buy.  Besides serving a dish that brings back so many wonderful memories is, well - priceless.

review/summary: Wow! What a find!  Such a good deal!
review/text: This pasta is in class of its own.  So far I created a white wine clam sauce and added the bucatini.  Unlike other pasta, the bucatini absorbed all the sauce and created a very flavorful pasta dish.  This is an excellent value with Subscribe & Save. It works out to be $1.26 per package.  Take that, Prince Spaghetti!<br /><br />More updates to follow.<br /><br />Mangia!

review/text: I had been searching for this type of pasta for three years - ever since a friend in NY had served it to us - he had<br />bought it in Rome.  Could not find it anywhere locally and was thrilled to find it online.  It is like spaghetti only it<br />has a hole through the middle of it - makes it a "fluffier" type of pasta and the sauce can get inside the noodle.

Their packages look as if they have been drug behind the truck delivering them.  They promise to replace damaged or broken items, but the replacement never materializes.  The product is good though, if usable when you receive it.
