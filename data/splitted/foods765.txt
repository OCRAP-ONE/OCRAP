review/summary: Too thin
review/text: The description does not describe how thick these bully sticks are but for the price paid I expected a thicker bully stick.  I have bought this brand of chew in the store as singles and that was the size that I was expecting because the price of those is about 3.50 and I thought it would be good value for 6 of them.  These sticks were really really thin and not worth it at all.  I would rather buy the singles.

review/text: These bully sticks are probably the skinniest I have ever seen, we are talking pencil thin so of course my dog chewed them in about two seconds. For the price I paid I would really warn people off this brand as it is hard to find another brand with less bang for your buck. A complete rip off honestly.

review/summary: dog likes them
review/text: For the size/quantity, these chews are pretty expensive, but my dog likes them. He's somewhat particular about what he chews (doesn't like nyla bones, unflavored rawhide, most of his squeaky chew toys, or some antlers), but he's pretty happy to chew these, and supposedly they're better than rawhide for your dog (more protein, easily digestable). He's not CRAZY about these, and they're not enough to distract him if he's interested in something else, but if he's otherwise bored, he'll chew these over any of his rawhide chews.<br /><br />Also, note the size (about as thick as a pencil, 5" long), and take that into consideration. My dog is pretty smart about chewing, and will patiently put a chew between his paws and gnaw on the end until pieces break off that are small enough to swallow, but if he were more eager, he could easily swallow large pieces and potentially choke, so just be careful and watch your dog to see what he or she does with it.

review/summary: A Half the cans were dented & 3 of them weren't sealed
review/text: I didn't look at the case of dog food when it arrived too carefully.  When I started to feed it to my dog I found that half of the cans were dented.  Not a big deal, at least not until I got to the cans that were dented so badly that they had lost the seal.  It was all moldy at the top and I had to throw those ones out.  My dog does love this, but then he loves all canned food I have given him.  I bought this because it is one of very few canned dog foods that are meant for puppies, and it was one of the most affordable ones too.  I was disappointed that the food comes all ground up in a paste.  Some of the adult Purina canned foods have actual pieces of meat and rice that you can see (there is usually a picture of what it looks like on the back).  I have also read up on some of the ingredients here and I am going to switch to another brand with better ingredients and with ingredients that I can actually see, even if it means feeding my dog an adult formula.  Purina isn't bad, but if you can afford to spend a little more there are much better brands out there.

review/summary: Relax Refreshed, Enjoy It Now, While You Still Can
review/text: This is the original recipe Dr. Pepper. It is made with 100% pure cane sugar; none of the high-fructose corn syrup the soft-drink industry has been shoving down our throats for years. This means even people with corn allergies can enjoy Dr.Pepper. Unfortunately, after October 2012, manufacturing of original recipe Dr. Pepper will be forced to cease. Apparently Snapple purchased Dr. Pepper and will no longer allow the production of the original recipe.<br />Original recipe Dr. Pepper tastes great. It has the same calorie count and caffeine content as the "standard" Dr. Pepper.<br />I wonder if a petition would sway Snapple's decision?<br />While it is still available, it is a very good price, but shipping is a bit outrageous. (However, considering 24 cans weighs about 20 pounds, I can understand.)<br />I suggest you buy original recipe Dr. Pepper while you still can and perhaps send off a note to Snapple requesting they permit Dr. Pepper original recipe to co-exist with "standard" Dr. Pepper.

Every single can was dented in multiple places.  The dents were so bad I had to check each can to make sure that it hadn't filled with gas.  Lastly, each can expires in May 2012.  It's as if the store gave me all their OLD merchandise.  I will never make this purchase again.

review/summary: Best popcorn for those who like it tasty & simple.
review/text: This is the best low calorie popcorn I have tasted. It isn't exactly like movie theater popcorn. In my opinion it's better. Movie popcorn always turns out to be too salty and overloaded with unhealthy fat. Skinny Pop is lightly salted and is made with sunflower seed oil, which gives it a nice flavor. If you are looking for the strong movie theater popcorn taste, this is not it. But, this is a light yummy tasting popcorn that will keep you going back for more (I can seriously go through a large bag of these in one day). Can also be found at Whole Foods Market for those that have one in their area.

review/summary: Love the taste, but it isnt consistent in each bag.
review/text: I have bought this product about 10-12 times. The first bag I ever bought was OK, dry tasting like most light popcorns. I bought it again when it was on sale and that bag was great, really did taste like movie theater popcorn (more so than other light popcorns). Now having purchased this product a few times I can say that the amount of oil used in the batch is not evenly distrubuted. Some bags have very little oil while others have much more. The oil is obvoiusly where all the flavor lies so its very disappointing when I get a dry bag. It has happened 3 times out of the 10-12 times I have bought this. So maybe the people with the poor reviews got dry bags.<br /><br />Also Id like to add that calories must be different between the bags because of this discrpency ** so it makes me wonder is it 39 calories a cup, for the oiled popcorn or the dry popcorn...  ??

After buying several bags - (she 'loves' the stuff) - and after the merchant ran out of the product, I went online to find a new source.  (The merchant indicated they 'didn't know' if they would reorder, or not.)  She obviously likes the product 'very much'...(I'm not a popcorn eater, myself)...and I was pleased to find it on Amazon.com.  (Wal-Mart's website indicated they sold it as well, but the item was 'not available'.)  No other store (locally) carrys the product.  The order process was simple as always, the shipping time was quick, and the product was packaged 'very well' (from 'Peters Select').

review/summary: Best solution
review/text: After trying the other methods for preserving wine, I can say this one works the best. In order of effectiveness, I'd rank them as 3- pump,  2-nitrogen gas, and 1-wine shield. We used to use the pump, then switched to gas. With gas, we'd get 2 or more days out of a bottle depending on the wine. Whites can go a lot longer, but some reds would taste a little different after a day with gas. But with the wine shield, I have gone 4 days or so with very little change in red wines. We refrigerate them after opening and warm them up when ready to drink. The only issue I've found with the wine shield is it doesn't fit as well in some gewurztraminer bottles which are narrower, but gawurz keeps pretty well anyway, so we just use gas for those. We are regular wine drinkers, and polishing off one bottle a night between 2 people leaves me a little fuzzy the next day, and can get pricey. We usually drink a half bottle with dinner, and pair our wines, so we may have 3 open bottles at a time. This has been a great solution, and after 2 10 packs I am sold. I just went for the 130 pack.

review/summary: A true classic candy bar with a controversial name
review/text: You have heard the story about how the Baby Ruth candy bear was not named for Babe Ruth but for Ruth Cleveland, daughter of President Grover Cleveland.  Well, sorry to disappoint you, but that story is not true.  The first Baby Ruth bars were made by the Curtiss Candy Company, which was founded in Chicago in 1916 by Otto Schnering, who used his mother's maiden name since it was much more American-sounding and would not cause the problems that a German surname would during World War I.  The first confection made by Curtiss was the Kandy Kate, which featured a pastry center topped with nuts and coated with chocolate.  Then in 1921 revised the product so that was now a log-shaped bar made of caramel and peanuts, covered in chocolate.  Priced at only five cents, half the cost of competing candy bars, Schnering named it the Baby Ruth bar, which soon became one of the hottest selling candies on the market.<br /><br />Now, the explanation that the candy bar was named for "Baby" Ruth Cleveland, the former President's first-born daughter, has been the official explanation proffered by the Curtiss Candy Company since the 1920's while the Babe Ruth legend has been the obvious explanation, especially since Ruth had joine the Yankees in 1920 and in 1921, the year the Baby Ruth debuted, he hit a then-record 59 home runs.  However, the idea that the Baby Ruth bar was named after Ruth Cleveland is rather morbid given she died of diptheria at the age of 12 in 1904, seventeen years before the candy bar was named.<br /><br />The more reasonable explanation seems that the Curtiss Candy Company did indeed find a way to link their product to the Yankee slugger who was becoming the most famous person in the country.  Ironically, Curtiss had to fight off a challenge from a competitor who was attempting to market the Babe Ruth Home Run Bar, endorsed by the Babe himself.  The Curtiss claim that the bar was named for Ruth Cleveland was enough to fight off the challenge, since the names were too close to one another to allow the new product to be marketed that way.  The fact that Curtiss maintained for years that the Baby Ruth bar came out before years before Babe Ruth became famous is enough to pop the balloon since in 1920 Ruth had broken his single season home run record of 29 by hitting 54 round trippers.<br /><br />Of course all that matters now is that this is still a classic American candy bar.  Beneath the milk chocolate coating of Nestles popular 2.1 ounce candy bar is a chewy, peanut-covered center, wrapped in a nougat that is really more of a white or blonde fudge.  In terms of caloric ration the Baby Ruth is 46% Carbs, 48% Fats, and 6% Protein.  The candy bar is low in Sodium and very low in Cholesterol, which is good, but high in Saturated Fat, which is supposedly bad (where do people think the taste comes from?).  A large portion of the calories come from the sugars, which is how nature intended it.  If you want a candy bar with actual peanuts in it, the Baby Ruth is still a good choice.<br /><br />Ironically, I did find a Champion Cocker Spaniel named Baby Ruth, whelped in 1892, who was in all probability actually named for President Cleveland's daughter, Ruth, who had been the first child to be born in the White House the previous year.  She was bred by Joseph Smith of Canada and sold to Andrew Laidlaw and became the foundation on which Mepal built one of the strongest kennels in the United States.  All three Best in Show Cocker Spaniels at the Westminster Dog Show could trace their pedigree back to this particular Baby Ruth.

I have had several other candy bars and after they were gone I looked around for several months before I found the right bar, I compared it to the reeses bar of a similar price and definitly feel this is a much better candy bar."<br /><br />  Thats what a review should be like.<br /><br />  No offence buddy, I just messing with you, I really liked your review,  it was intersting. ( I found your review helpful:)

review/summary: They're OK
review/text: A friend of mine brought these over to my place a month ago for one of my horror movie marathons ("horrorthons").  I think they're just "OK".  Nothing great.  They have a cheese flavor added to them.  Vital nutrition information is as follows:  11 chips provide 160 calories, 1 gram of saturated fat, 4.5 grams of polyunsaturated fat, 4.5 grams of monounsaturated fat, 0 mg of cholesterol, 310 mg of sodium, 410 mg of potassium, 15 grams of carbohydrates, 1 gram of dietary fiber, 1 gram of sugar, 2 grams protein, 0% vitamin A, 2% calcium, 10% vitamin C, and 4% iron.<br /><br />This bag of potato chips is still sitting on top of my refrigerator, with half the bag left.  I'm not a fan of monosodium glutamate, and these chips contain it.<br /><br />One bag of these is enough for me, but you might want to try them.  You might like them.  To each their own.

review/text: While this is an excellent product, it is not exactly like the picture in the description.  The box in the picture has the word "chicken" written in a blue box.  That is the Swanson low sodium stock.  What I got was the box with "chicken" written in a gold box which is their standard stock. Not a big deal unless you're looking to cut back on salt.

review/text: I almost don't want to write this review because I want all of the vinegar to myself!  If you get this you won't be sorry.  The thickness of the vinegar is not because it's been reduced, but because it has been aged for so long and for so well.  The vinegar has a nice sweetness to it which is unbelievable since it contributes to the flavor in an undistracting way.  Great for topping caprese, prosciutto, serrano ham...the possibilities are endless...

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I am a candy bar addict and a sugar junkie, and when I head to the candy bar isle at the local Quicky-Mart I always pick up a 5th Avenue.<br /><br />5th Avenue is a wondeful blend of chocolate, peanut butter and crunch that will leave you hungry for more. 5th Avenue is unlike any other cany bar on the market, and if you've never tried one...do yourself a big favor. You won't regret it! Yum!<br /><br />Some history on the candy bar from Hershey's:<br /><br />William H. Luden (1859-1949) launched his fledgling candy business in 1879 and offered an extensive line, including cough drops, hard and soft candies, chocolates and marshmallow products. Unlike many confectioners during that time, Luden manufactured his own chocolate for his chocolate novelties and chocolate-coated candies. In 1936, he introduced the 5TH AVENUE candy bar, a milk chocolate bar with a crunchy peanut butter center.<br /><br />World War II forced Luden's to concentrate production efforts on Luden's menthol throat drops and 5TH AVENUE candy bars for military use. Immediately following the war, Luden's reverted to producing a full line of confectionery products including the famous Luden's menthol throat drops and 5TH AVENUE candy bar, as well as penny candy consisting of ladyfingers, pillowcases, mint patties, penny jujube novelties, penny hard candy, penny coconut novelties, cast marshmallow novelties, and a line of penny sugar-rolled jellies.<br /><br />Timeline<br /><br />1859  William H. Luden, founder, born.<br />1879  W. H. Luden Candy Company established.<br />1928  Acquired by Food Industries of Philadelphia, a holding company owned by the Dietrich family.<br />1936  5TH AVENUE candy bar introduced.<br />1980  Queen Anne Candy Company, Hammond, IN, acquired by Luden's Inc.<br />1986  Acquired by Hershey Foods Corporation.

review/summary: Love this packet sauce, great for adding to soup!
review/text: This taco sauce is bought by the military and I grab some whenever I eat on base to add flavor to food. It's like a hot sauce with more flavor then just mild heat. The description says hot but it's comparable to a taco bell hot taco sauce for heat so really at best a medium. Many in today's America would call it a mild. I really enjoy putting it in canned tomato based soups for added flavor it turns blah into decent. I'm happy Amazon has it and like the packets as opposed to a bottle so it will stay fresh longer and be more convenient to use for bag lunches and picnics. Heinz makes some great condiments, no doubt, and they are reasonably priced. I'm not sure what shipping costs are but it's under 10 cents a packet and while not as inexpensive as I would like is tolerable for me to order it if I owned a food place or wanted it for home use.

review/text: My daughter LOVES Annie's Sour Cream and Onion Bunnies--she calls them sour bunnies. It's the only cracker she'll eat in her lunch. They have sooo much more flavor than the regular cheddar bunnies. We would love to see these get a little wider distribution. Most of the major chains carry the cheddar bunnies, but none carry these delicious crackers. We cannot find them anywhere in North Houston and have to buy them by the dozen on Amazon--which really isn't so bad since we get a little savings in the process. And we know we don't have to worry about them all getting eaten!

review/text: These cookies were a seasonal offering at a local store.  I purchased one box.  After trying them at home, I returned to the store and purchased the remaining inventory! A simple scoop of vanilla ice cream is transformed by the inclusion of a butter crisp. I also love them with tea...or straight out of the box.  Don't be daunted by purchasing a pack of 12 boxes.  The cost is a little over half of what I paid in the store.  Lastly, unless you hide them in a dark corner of your pantry, you'll never have to worry about the shelf life, because they will be consumed quickly by family, friends, and yourself!

I also wondered when I opened the box how I would ever eat that amount of cookies, but now I'm pretty sure it's not going to be enough.  They did arrive broken somewhat even though Amazon put in extra packaging air bags. Doesn't change the taste, so I don't care.

review/summary: So Simple, So Fantastic
review/text: Sugar, butter and eggs are three staples of almost every kitchen.  Who knew that these three ingredients could combine in such a way to produce Jules Destrooper's wonderful butter crisps?<br /><br />I actually learned about butter crisps from my wife's aunt who makes them each year at Christmas.  She always gives us a lot of them and I always eat way more than I should.  I love these treats and they have become a highlight of Christmas for me.<br /><br />The other day I was walking through a local store and happened upon these Jules Destrooper Butter Crisps and immediately grabbed a box.  While they aren't quite as good as the homemade ones of my wife's aunt, they come in at an extremely close second place.<br /><br />Homemade always beats the store bought brand in my opinion, but Jules Destrooper will now get me through the year until December rolls around.  If you enjoy a lightly sweetened, terribly addictive treat, I highly recommend Jules Destrooper's butter crisps.  They are a great snack any time of year and are the perfect compliment to ice cream, coffee or all by themselves.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: They are crisp, buttery yet light.<br /><br />Unlike some other cookies, they even taste great when they are broken into smaller pieces (as shipping by Belgium is liable to do sometimes).<br /><br />The only downside is they are addicting - there are about 24 wafers per box and before you know, it's time to order another 12-pack :-)<br /><br />Yes, it seems like a lot but if you need to remove temptation - these make great gifts. As you can see, the boxes are classy and in most gourmet stores, EACH box can sell for nearly $6! ... so you will also seem a genuine benefactor :-)<br /><br />The only thing wrong with these cookies is that Amazon makes it too easy to obtain :-)

review/text: I know that product because I was raised in Belgium.<br /><br />I send Jules Destrooper to my adopted soldier and he loved the waffles more than<br />the thins.  But he nevertheless liked the thins more than expected.<br />His buddies liked them too and I doubt any package is left.<br /><br />Not everyone likes this specific taste (spekuloos is made with cinnamon)<br /><br />Personally I love Jules Destrooper tiny waffles best.  All is excellent tho.<br />highest quality.  Delacre is also excellent.  Lotus is less good. too much sugar.<br /><br />A favourite brand that develops taste without making you feel saturated with fat.

review/summary: Jules Destrooper Almond Thins review
review/text: These snacks are so delicious! Sadly during the shipping there was minimal cracking of the small crackers. Although it isn't an issue to me because my family and I just eat them plain; it may be for some who serve it with a parfait and want excellent presentation or something like that. But that was just my experience. Will be purchasing more most likely when we run out.

review/summary: Elegant cookies of excellent quality
review/text: All of the Jules Destrooper cookies are made in Belgium with good quality ingredients and packaged well.  They are quite attractive and whenever I serve them to someone who has never had them before, they always comment on them.<br /><br />The thins are especially elegant, thin and crisp, wonderful with ice cream or a warm beverage.  My only complaint about Jules Destrooper cookies is that it is very difficult not to eat a whole box at once.  Whenever I see them at the dollar store, I stock up and try to hide a few boxes in the top cabinet.<br /><br />Ginger Thins - These have plenty of nice chewy little bits of translucent candied ginger (5%) that contrast with the almost brittle cookie and have a good balance of spice (ginger and a hint of cinnamon) to sweet.  These are wonderful with tea.<br /><br />Almond Thins - Crispy with lots of almond slivers and slices (10%) and a pronounced flavor of both brown sugar and butter.  I appreciate that they aren't loaded up with almond extract, making the taste more delicate in than the usual almond cookie.  Especially good with ice cream, cr&egrave;me br�l&eacute;e, or any custard-based dessert.<br /><br />Butter Crisps - These are also nice and crunchy but with a more neutral flavor, very buttery, similar to an ice cream cone.  They are excellent with a thin smear of jam and hot chocolate or with ice cream.<br /><br />Paris Butter Waffles - These are not quite as brittle or elegant as the others but because of the deep waffle pattern, they are the perfect vehicle for hazelnut chocolate spread (Nutella) or speculoos spread (Biscoff spread) and a cup of coffee.  This variety does have artificial vanilla, which is actually preferred by many for baking cookies.

review/summary: My new found favorite.
review/text: These cookies are delicious. I first tasted them when a box came in a Mother's Day gift basket.  When the last crumb had vanished, I searched for more on Amazon and, sure enough, my favorite shopping spot came through.  This crunchy, buttery waffle cookie is a terrific addition to a bowl of Blue Bell (yes, I'm a loyal Texan) ice cream or a good cup of tea or coffee. We even eat them with a cup of yogurt or kefir as a light evening meal.  You'll find your own favorite situations for this tasty treat.  The only thing I would change is the packaging.  Each thin box holds only 8 cookies, although each cookie is about 1 1/2 x 3 inches, so one cookie is plenty to eat in most cases.  Also on the positive side, the small packaging ensures that the crispiness lasts after the box is opened. I should add, the cookies are in two plastic nests of four cookies inside a foil package inside the cardboard box, so a good clamp keeps the opened cookies crisp and whole. Bon apetit!

review/summary: Awesome and addicting
review/text: Wonderful flavor and crunch. I especially enjoy them with my tea. The ingredients are natural, and since I don't remember seeing the ingredient list with the product information I'll give it here: wheat flour, brown sugar, butter, almonds(10%), salt, leavening:sodium bicarbonate. I use to buy these at my grocery, but only if they were on sale. Amazon's price beats the sale price, so Amazon is a very good bargain. Knowing how thin the cookie is I was concerned about the shipping breaking the cookies, but frankly the product shipped from Amazon was in better condition than the grocery version. These truly are wonderful, but beware that once you've opened a box it's very hard to stop at a single serving (8 cookies). There are about 30 cookies per box, and I confess, I've eaten an entire box in a day. If you like the flavor combination of brown sugar, butter, and almonds then you will really like these cookies.

review/summary: The Swedish Chef Would Be Proud!
review/text: Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of all things swedish, from Lingonberries to salt cod to Lutefisk to those yummy red candy fish. When I saw that Jules Destrooper had invented yet another Swedish delectable, I could not wait for my package to arrive!<br /><br />After assaulting the UPS driver and absconding with my "butter waffles" (which are more like cookies), I went into my kitchen and sat down in my breakfast nook to eat them. A hearty glass of milk was all I needed to drench the entire box and consume it. In reality, I ended up saturating the cardboard box and must have eaten that as well, because when I was done there was nothing left save for some soggy nuggets stuck to my ceiling. I assume they are from my delicious waffles and not from my earlier experiment of stuffing a cornish game hen with popping corn to "make its own stuffing." I am still picking bits of hen from my bushy, inappropriately dark eyebrows.<br /><br />Also, some recipe ideas for these waffles include topping them with olives, tuna salad, anchovy and pretzel (an old Slavic favorite) and peanut butter. Sometimes I give these to the neighbor children when they behave themselves, and actually I have only given one out to one neighbor child. My neighbor's kids are usually misbehaving and absolutely do not deserve any of my tasty cookies! Anyway, it turns out the one kid I gave it to was actually a lawn jockey statue, which makes sense because my neighbors, the "Davenports," have very light skin. They are actually quite pasty and I am waiting for the day when one of them develops melanoma, because they are always out in the sun, in their pool, having a "heck of a time," under the sun's deadly rays, oblivious to the cellular damage they are inflicting on themselves. I prefer to stay inside during the daytime and nighttime hours, usually venturing from my house every fortnight to collect my mail. However, when I know a delivery of Jules Destrooper Butter waffles are arriving, I am on "high alert" and spring from my rascal mobility scooter whenever I hear a car door close.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE these waffles. Buy them, and If you don't love them too, send them off to me!!!

review/summary: Honest, It's Ever So Slightly (barely) Flavored Cheddar Corn Air
review/text: I just received these so-called Cheddar Skinny Sticks, and a lot of reviewers who said that these "Cheddar" Skinny Sticks had a mild or non-existent cheddar flavor were right!  However, they were ok (I know this seems contradictory) but needed cheddar flavor (CHEDDAR PLEASE. Or, please, don't misleadingly call it cheddar).<br />  Or, at least enough to justify calling this product "cheddar". This snack only has an  extremely barely noticeable (only a slight hint of) cheddar flavor.<br />  The taste was very light/airy- kind of like Corn Flavored Bugles!  That's why I thought that they were ok (per my giving it the 3star 'ok' rating).  And, if you have a taste for a nice corn snack with a, virtually, nonexistent Cheddar flavor, then here they are.<br />  But, most are here looking for Cheddar Flavored Snacks vs others because we want to taste the Cheddar!  So, 2stars off for the makers neglecting this crucial fact. I really wanted to like these- cause, yes, admittedly, I am trying to get skinny and need a good cheddar flavored healthy snack.<br />  How cheap can you be to call something Cheddar, then, when you make it- barely include a cheddar taste within it??  The makers of this product need to SERIOUSLY read the reviews and consider putting some Cheddar Flavor in this product before they can be honest about calling it Cheddar. I'm disappointed- but this makes an ok corn snack.<br />  You want something that, truthfully, advertises itself having a certain flavor and lives up to it:  Like Doritoes or Cheetos? Or, even near that? Then, honestly, you need to keep looking.<br />  I hope that I've been helpful.

review/text: Absolutely love this tea!  But it's not for you if you're looking for a mild experience. This one is designed to wake you up in every sense - especially the taste buds!  I've found this is available in stores, so look for yours today!

review/summary: MORE OVALTINE, PLEASE!
review/text: I love this stuff and will soon start buying it from here--you can't beat the price.<br /><br />I add this to "pre-chocolated" milk, muahahaha.  This makes milk taste rich, but not to the extent where it becomes over-powering.<br /><br />You've got to love the malt in it, too.

review/summary: Overpriced Ovaltine
review/text: The price here is just plain robbery!!  There are a number of stores including Target that have the 12 oz for under $4. Waste your money if you want.

review/summary: THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU ORDER
review/text: You will get the plain MALT and amazon will not fix it.  So I'm returning mine to Walmart.  There is a huge difference in taste btwn that malt and chocolate malt.  DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU WANT CHOCOLATE MALT!!!

review/summary: I'd Like To Actually Review This; But Amazon Won't Let Me
review/text: I've giving it three stars based on a guess and on the taste of the non-chocolate flavor. I sort of like the regular, non-chocolate malt, so I'll put the chocolate variety in the middle.  Though I might have given it five stars, had Amazon sent it to me.<br /><br />How about an explanation?<br /><br />OK, I ordered Ovaltine Chocolate Malt Drink Mix, like it says here.  I received malt, no chocolate.  Told Amazon.  They were very nice and immediately shipped another order... of plain malt again.  Since, I've tried to get a response from them.  No real answer, my emails are ignored (very unlike Amazon).<br /><br />I mean, if  they're having some sort of problem finding the right Ovaltine, at least respond and don't leave a very good customer hanging.  Just makes sense to me.  I appreciate courtesy, don't you?<br /><br />Now, at first, I was willing to forgive and forget; but stonewalling ain't nice.  Nope, not a proper way to treat customers.  I really must again add that this is not like Amazon; but somebody has really dropped this ball.  I even have gone to the trouble of paining them pictures,twice, giving links to the different Ovaltines.  No appreciation for my efforts; just silence.<br /><br />I mean, is it possible they expect me to accept what I didn't order but paid for?  Do they think sending another wrong item makes it OK?  Well, you see,their "expecting" that is what I don't like.  Changed my own generosity.  Come on, who likes to be stonewalled?  It's arrogant.<br /><br />So, if Amazon will just send the chocolate Ovaltine, as shown here, I'll re-edit this and tell you what I really think of the chocolate version.<br /><br />ADDENDUM<br /><br />Well, I still haven't tasted the chocolate; but I thank Amazon for refunding my money.  They say they found something wrong with the product.  Maybe it just wasn't there?
