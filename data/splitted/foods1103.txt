review/summary: Whiska's Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken Improved My Cats' Health
review/text: I used to never feed my cats wet food because they preferred dry and I thought it was fine as long as they drank plenty of water.  After losing one cat to death mysteriously and another one to kidney disease I decided to follow the advice of many on the web and switch to wet food.  I tried many brands including the most expensive, but my three cats prefer Whiskas Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken to all others.  I mix them together in the bowl.  All three of my cats run to the bowls to gobble up the food and they don't leave a morsel.  Also, my cats do not throw up this food like they do dry food.  I can't believe the change in their health.  In just a short time my two older boys went from being round fatties to having shape and nice healthy curves.  And their coats are absolutely gorgeous.  The oils in the food obviously create a nice sheen.  Also, the shedding is way down.  Thanks Whiskas and keep it comin'.

review/text: Received 24 packets of cat food - quantity was unclear in advertising.<br />The packaging protected against damage as if the packets were crystal glassware.<br />The shipping cost was too high for the amount of product received.<br />My cat loves it, so I will find some alternative to keep a supply.

review/summary: Great service
review/text: This is the only wet cat food that one of our cats will eat and we have been having problems always finding it in our local Wal-Mart.  So I was really pleased when I found that I could order it online and was also able to set up a schedule for monthly delivery.  I was even more pleased when I found that I could adjust the schedule when I needed to order it sooner than expected.  This is a great service for us and we have since set up another schedule for two of their other chicken products.

review/text: I have to say that I have tried all kinds of expensive catfood for my grown cat.  He does not like the good stuff!  He prefers the cheap stuff so I have just adjusted to that.  I thought this tuna entree would be great, but he does not like it.  Sorry for the bad review since I am sure there are cats out there with all different pallates of taste.  If your kitty likes tuna which looks like it came from a can - bon appetit!

I've been ordering their beans for years - long before they had a website - and now I'm glad they have a presence on Amazon.<br /><br />For reference, I grind this espresso bean with a Rancilio Rocky, and draw a 25-second shot with an Expobar Office Lever Plus.<br /><br />My wife gets the Dark French Roast bean, and likes it the most compared to other beans she's tried from elsewhere over several years.

Whether in a an esspresso machine or coffeemaker, this "classic dark" roast is fairly bland.The caffeine is there, but you need to use a lot of the beans in order to get much flavor.

review/summary: the coffee is not very good
review/text: This would be a great value, but the coffee isn't very good.  It has a nice high roast but it does nothing to enhance a not very good bean.<br /><br />I suspect the cause is the freshness of the beans.  They have oil but their flavor is odd and unpleasant.  You can create a coffee that smells fabulous when high roasted, but high roasting won't cover up an unfresh or not good bean.

review/text: I ordered this coffe directly from The Bean Coffee Company using a Groupon and have been profoundly disappointed.  When I was shopping and ordering their website said 1.25 lb bags, but I was only shipped 12 oz bags and now the website has changed.  I can't even get someone from the company to contact me.  In addition to this, the coffee lacks the depth of flavor I expect with espresso and it leaves a very bad aftertaste in my mouth.  I would not recommend ordering!

review/text: The prunes were moist and sweet and definitely not what I expected. They were nice and juicy  and I can easily see myself eating these on a regular basis. They're much larger than I expected them to be with only 2 Points Plus in four of them.  I like knowing that they are high in fiber and antioxidants.  I normally have a banana for breakfast but since these are also high in potassium, I have no problem switching back and forth for something a little different.

review/text: This product is (sadly) like so many so-called "healthy" choices we see in our supermarkets.  It's got reduced (or no) sugar or fat, but is loaded with artery-clogging trans fats to improve the taste.  This product seems to be one of the worst offenders.  Here's a hint: Any time you see the word "hydrogenated" in the ingredient list, run away screaming.  It's safer (and more dramatic) than eating it.

review/summary: Primo coffee, crazy high price
review/text: I like the Keurig coffee system in general. Most of the coffee selections are OK, some are quite good. Among the very good, the Barrista Prima Columbian is far and away my favorite. Great taste, a medium to dark roast, with lots of full bodied complex flavor, much more so than any of the other Keurig coffees I have sampled (a bunch). Since it is Columbian, it doesn't have that intense sometimes unpleasant sensation that you get from African coffee. This coffee is what Keurig coffee should have been all along.<br /><br />Four stars instead of five due to the crazy high cost- almost a buck a cup! Admittedly, this particular coffee is worth it, but man! I think as Keurig gets more popular, they are going to stick it to us.<br /><br />P.S. Another good coffee is the Dunkin'Donuts K-cup, available at DD stores only I'm told, but very popular and quite tasty. The DD decaf is just as good for you decaf drinkers out there. And it is competitively priced, about $11.99 / 18 K-cups, as of this posting.

I had been hunting for sources; now I am happy to see Amazon brings it to my door!

review/text: This sauce has a wonderful mix of salt, garlic, chili, and that "je ne sais quoi" of ground dried shrimp or something.<br /><br />My kids spoon it generously into our stir fry dishes--hot but not too hot.<br /><br />Lots of restaurants around here--Cantonese dim sum places--make their own versions, but none is better than this simple jarred sauce.<br /><br />Here in Oakland, CA, we have an old Hong Kong/Cantonese Chinatown where a couple grocers usually carry it, and our suburban-style full-line Asian supermarket, Ranch 99 Market, also stocks it. As you can tell, we find it worth searching for.

review/text: I too used to buy and eat a similar tasting chili oil on rice!  I believe it was called "Chili Sa-te" and was a Vietnamese product but, I think, made by Huy Fong Foods.  It was in a plastic jar with a green top and it was easily my favorite pantry food item. I have been looking for it to no avail for SO long. In fact, yesterday, I was on-line trying to find it and could not.  I have had such a craving for it that I drove to a Chinese supermarket I know and was disappointed not to see it - but I thought Chiu Chow looked similar.  I really LOVE it and am so happy that I found it.  Anyone else know what the "old" stuff is that I liked?

review/text: This is one of those ingredients that people either love or hate - but most people I have served it to love it.  The scent of the truffle in the honey is amazing.  It is best served with a nutty hard cheese such as parmesan regianno (this is how it is served in Italy) and a mild cracker or bread.<br /><br />I have tried other brands which are also good and sometimes have more truffle flakes, but in side by side comparisons, I prefer this brand.<br /><br />Try this:  Take a plain pizza shell with just a light brush of olive oil and some grated parmesan and a sprinkle of sea salt and bake until crisp and then remove from the oven, drizzle with the truffle honey and serve as a appetizer.

review/summary: Trying to decide it it's worth the splurge.
review/text: Like I said, I'm still trying to decide if this is worth the money. And I've never had fresh truffles, so I can't speak to their representation in this honey. What I do know is that the honey has an earthy smell and taste that is unique. I bought it to make Blue Cheese Truffle Honey souffle, and it was the best souffle I've ever had. I don't think I'll probably buy truffle honey again, but as far as it goes, this is pretty good.<br /><br />Just a non-product note: I initially received a package that contained one mostly full jar, one empty jar, and a lot of sticky mess. Neither jar was broken, or even open, they had just leaked. Amazon shipped me new ones without question, but it was still slightly inconvenient. This is probably a lot more likely to happen in warmer months.

review/summary: Great price, great taste and visible truffle in every jar!
review/text: I love truffles and a recent culinary experience brought good cheese, fresh bread and truffle honey to my table  - I was hooked by the combination so ordered a jar for over twenty dollars from an artisan cheese type place which of course also added shipping (which I was okay with as these was some good cheese in that order to) but alas  - or so I thought - they ran out of stock and the order was shipped with the honey omitted!<br /><br />With these cheese already on the way I thought I was going to have to seek out some local gourmet shops but as  often do - gave Amazon a quick try first and lo and behold come across this - two jars shipped for less than the price of one and reviews were good!<br /><br />The honey is amazing!! You could smell the truffles as soon as I retrieved the box off my doorstep - it was that strong! As I opened the box the smell became more pronounced...I knew this was going to be good stuff!! Also, worth noting - in each jar, you could actually see a small sliver of truffle, about the size of a quarter! Impressive given the price!<br /><br />So the price is good, the smell is good - but what about the taste!! This really is divine! Light, tasty honey with a strong truffle taste! Yum! My favorite way to eat this was drizzled over some Hudson Valley Camembert and some fresh bread! The combination was perfect!<br /><br />So yes this is from Amazon not some little boutique type cooking store and yes, its cheap given the competition...but YES this is worth it!!

review/text: The cereal diet is boring. Don't get me wrong, I love cereal, but going on the "special K" diet just messes with your head.<br /><br />This cereal bar helps! As has been said in other reviews, it is reminiscent of a rice krispy treat, but it is a little denser, not really marshmellowy or buttery and more like a cookie. I'm not using it as part of the cereal diet, but just as a snack instead of a candy bar. It is satisfying like a candy bar but with only 90 calories and with cereal as the first ingredient.<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthier alternative to a cookie or a more interesting snack than a chewy bar, this is a good way to go.

However, the raspberry cheesecake is my favorite followed by Chocolatey Chip Cookie.<br /><br />Does it have the flavor of a chocolate chip cookie?  YES!<br /><br />Does it look and feel like a chocolate chip cookie?  Of course NOT , its a "Special K" Bar!<br /><br />To me ALL "Special K" Bars resemble a rice crispy treat.<br />If you like other flavors of this bars and chocolate chip cookies, I think you will like this one!<br /><br />About summer shipping and chocolate... I live in Central Texas. To my surprise, even with it being 106 degrees outside they were only melted a tad. I was eating one before the UPS guy was even out of my drive! Some of the chips were stuck to the top of the wrapper , I licked that wrapper clean(like a kid would do!LOL). The next day I could not even tell they had melted at all. The wrappers were clean.  I am a prime member and got them in 2 days so I am sure that made the difference ;}

The Almond and Vanilla teas seem to hide the actual tea and I wish it wouldn't since I know how fantastic that tea taste can be.  That being said it deserves a strong 4 stars and am sure to order more of this tea in the future.

review/text: Wow! I've been buying dog treats for over 40 years and this one takes the cake! Pay no attention to the photo in the advertisement for this product. What you get is two (2) small chews in each of three (3) shrink wrapped over cardboard packages. That's a total of six (6) small chews for $30.00 not including shipping! I couldn't return my order quick enough.

review/text: I was not impressed about this product (Made in China). Cheaply made and not very good quality. Outside was coated with redish brown sweet something which stained the carpet.  My dog first tried to lick the coating and then bit the "bone".  It was like hard leather, more than bone, and left a mess of shreds about as well.

If you're looking for something that lasts much longer than a biscuit but doesn't need to last for hours like other rawhide treats then this is perfect.

review/text: The company that sent this was great, I got it in like 3 days of ordering it. Great price compared to other stores. Would buy from them again but the product itself was gross. I followed the instructions to the letter but the pearls are yucky. I was making Bubble Tea for my GS Troop and no one would eat the tapioca pearls. I really thought it would have some sort of flavoring, I was wrong. The drink itself was good flavor but to me the pearls don't add anything to the drink. It's a decoration thing. The pearls are pretty color but I think I would go with just a solid color next time. Like I said the company great product not so much and the seller has nothing to do with that.

review/summary: Kitten Heaven
review/text: This catnip is so potent my cat begs for it. We have to keep the container hidden away or she will try to pry off the lid with her teeth. After purchasing a "bulk" brand catnip at the local store, she turned her nose up and thought it was just terrible that we would expect her to go kitten wild over anything else.<br /><br />Cosmic Catnip is the one she loves and she will literally eat it out of the container by the mouthful if we let her. It is interesting that cats in nature actually eat wild catnip to aid with digestion. They recommend a tablespoon, but a teaspoon seems to be enough to make any cat a little bouncy and playful. Princess will nibble on some from the container and then we sprinkle some on the floor and she rolls around and acts like she is in kitten heaven.<br /><br />This is also good for toys and you can roll a toy in the catnip and your cat should be occupied for quite a while. While this herb makes cats wild, I drink a catnip tea and it seems calming.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: It's not like they're addicted. There's no withdrawal if I finish a tub. But this is the BEST, FRESHEST, most aromatic catnip I've found. My three cats don't agree on much, but they LOVE this stuff, sniff it, chew it, roll in it each time, going on three years now. It calms, delights, entertains them and makes me very popular on the home front. Plus it's mainly nice clean leaves, not so many seeds, so it's easy clean up.

review/summary: It's not what I was expecting
review/text: Sorry I can't give this stuff a screaming good review.  Maybe catnip is a sort of personal thing as our cat Tasha has shown great interest in catnip filled mice in the past but this catnip she's ambivalent to.  Hence why I can only give the product a neutral three stars.  I stuffed a catnip mouse with this product and she checked the freshly filled mouse out but showed a nearby older catnip laced mouse more interest.  I placed a small amount next to her on the back patio and yes, after two sessions, she ate it all but other than laying there, she seemed not to be affected by the catnip.  I fed some catnip to her a second time and she ate a bit but in the end, blew the rest of the catnip off.  In the morning while my wife and I are on the patio for coffee, Tasha's more animated in her morning play without then with.<br /><br />In summary, I can't say it's not good catnip, I can only say that Tasha didn't show a whole lot of interest in this product.  I guess like beer, everybody has their product preferences and for her, this doesn't seem to be knocking her socks off.  I'm currently looking at other catnip products, including sprays and extract oils.  FWIW, if we wanted, we can get this same product at our local pet store for a bit less then here; including California sales tax, $5.50.  When one takes into consideration the price of gas coupled to the time it takes to shop for a product of this kind, this is a reasonably priced product.  I'll keep trying to interest Tasha in this product as I'm not going throw the catnip away.  And if she shows more than a passing interest, I'll stop by, change my star rating and amend what I've written here.  Until then, hope my above helps with your shopping decision.

review/summary: Loving Crystal Light grapefruit drink!
review/text: My husband and I really enjoyed Crystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit Drink Mix,<br />but then we couldn't find it in our local grocery stores, so when my daughter<br />told me that I could get it from amazon.com,  I was delighted.  I ordered a year's supply.<br />so I won't have search any more.<br />  It is a refreshing thirst quencher without many calories.<br />  Now maybe I will look for another product that I can't find locally. . . .

review/summary: My family loves this flavor of Crystal Light.
review/text: I don't know if I would have tried this flavor if I just had to pick it off the shelf.  But someone else introduced me to it & my family can't get enough.  The only problem has been the local stores that used to carry this flavor don't anymore.  I was so excited when someone else, who's also hooked on it, told me she purchases it in bulk from Amazon.  Yeah!!!  My family is happy again.

review/summary: A lost favorite is found!
review/text: This flavor of Crystal Light is my absolute favorite,but suddenly none of the stores in my area carry it. So I figured it must have been discontinued. Such is my fate; I must have contrarian tastes! But Amazon to the rescue. Ruby Red Grapefruit Drink Mix flavor is super refreshing and I can (and do) drink gallons of it since the calories are few.

review/text: I love this drink and being diabetic it is impossible to find a juice that is no carb. I love the sweet/tartness of it and the taste comes close to the real thing. I was devasted when they pulled it from production. Tried everyone of the new concocotions  crystal light has currently on market and might as well been drinking kool-aid. I am an adult, not twenty and want something that tastes adult.<br />Finding it on Amazon was wonderful and pricing is fair. Shipping is perfection,no hassles which is a must in a busy life. Hope they continue to supply but in meantime stocking up.

review/text: We ordered this product because for some reason Kraft has elected to discontinue it.  It is by far the best Crystal Light flavor in our opinion.  We have always found it hard to find in the grocery store, it was always sold out.  We wonder why Kraft would discontinue producing such a great product.  I hope Amazon has a large supply so we can continue enjoying this drink.  We are certainly going to order more and hope Amazon can supply us!

review/text: THE MAIN REASON I LIKE CRYSTAL LIGHT IN THE RUBY RED GRAPEFRUIT IS BECAUSE IT IS NOT "OVERLY" SWEET LIKE ALOT OF THE DIET DRINKS. IT REALLY QUENCHES YOUR THIRST ON A HOT SUNNY DAY.<br />WHAT SURPRISED WE THE MOST ABOUT IT WAS THAT MY HUSBAND LIKES IT AS MUCH AS I DO.<br /><br />I BOUGHT IN ON AMAZON BECAUSE IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND AT THIS TIME AND IT WAS SHIPPED REALLY FAST. IT WAS ALSO THE BEST PRICE THAT I FOUND.<br /><br />IF YOU LIKE A LITTLE TANGY, TRY IT I THINK YOU WILL LIKE IT.

review/text: I was shocked to discover that Amazon has a supply of this great product. I have been searching high and low in every grocery store and market for it. I had finally given up and switched to other flavors. They pale in comparison. This flavor is stronger and can stand to be mixed with more water that the recommended 4 quarts. I will do my best to buy the remainder that is available.

review/text: I love this drink!  I'm so very disappointed that I can no longer find it in my neighborhood supermarket as the prices I have to pay now are twice what they were.  However, I must say it's worth it.  I'm stocking up with the fear that Kraft will discontinue this flavor altogether and I'll be left without my mainstay for hydration.  At this time, if it weren't for CL Ruby Red Grapefruit, there's a good chance I wouldn't drink much at all.<br /><br />Four stars for the excellent flavor, one off for the somewhat ridiculous price.  :(  I'm used to Amazon having better prices (in general).  I suppose when you're the only one selling a product that someone wants, you can charge whatever the market will bear... my Republican principles slapping me in the face! haha!

review/text: We live on Crystal Light in our home, drinking gallons of it,  and every so often I like to try new flavors.  What I like about Crystal Light is that it is calorie free and that there is rarely a chemical after taste.  What I love about this drink is that the hint of grapefruit makes the drink more tart than usual(I always dilute them more than recommended) It's a pleasant change from iced tea and I think will become a new staple in our fridge.

review/text: I along with the rest of you grapefruit fans am mad that Kraft thinks that this flavor isn't that popular. Whenever I went into a Walmart,(less than $3 price too) I would buy up all that they had, because it was ALWAYS SOLD OUT!!!!!! I urge you to email Kraft...google crystal light, go to the web page and they have a form to fill out your protest.  Here is what I sent them.<br /><br />Dear Kraft:<br /><br />I cannot believe that you aren't making ruby red grapefruit crystal light anymore!!! That is the only flavor that was any good in the entire product line besides the lemonade!!!! It was always sold out at Walmart - if you say that it wasn't popular, that is just wrong!!! What happened at Walmart here in Reno, NV was that the dumbass buyers never kept enough of it in stock!! I'm mad, and there are alot of other people that probably are also. If you are still making it, can I buy a case wholesale? I don't want to pay $5/package on Amazon for this when it sold for under $3 at walmart. You can take that nasty pomegranate stuff and stick it where the sun don't shine.

review/text: Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.<br /><br />Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.<br /><br />I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!

Second, when the box is empty, and if you are big enough you can be stuck in it.<br /><br />This tasty meal in a pop-top can, reminiscent of C rations takes some strength and skill to open so you will not hear the sound of lids pealing back in the middle of the night and cats slurping the juice.<br /><br />Some cats rub on the hand that opens the can. Others wait until you are out of sight before you hear them devouring the tasty can innards. Bottom line is this product is part of a balanced diet and has yet to encounter any detractors.

However, I am subscribed to this product for a shipment every few months and without fail each shipment has arrived VERY bashed up. The outside box will be fine but then a few of the cans will be smashed in. One case even came with dripping cat food liquid on it- YUCK! I wrote a message to packaging for Amazon and received no assistance or changes. Product gets 2 stars because of the food itself. Amazon gets 0 stars for the way they handle/pack/ship this product.
