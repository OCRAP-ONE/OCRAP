review/text: I really like Chai tea,  but this Twinings is so-so.  It is very weak chai,  so I use two or three bags per cup (12oz cup).  The minty after taste is not to my liking either.  The Stash Chai is much better imo.

review/summary: Awesome rootbeer extract
review/text: I stumbled upon this extract at my local home brew shop and had made other homebrew soda's before so thought I would give this a try. it was remarkably good with real root beer byte to it. If trying to replicate at home I also used champagne yeast to "brew" this root beer not the generic brewers or baker's yeast. I recommend Champaign yeast for all homemade soda brews you get lots of bubble and very little yeasty taste :)

review/summary: Excellent Alternative to Dairy & Soy
review/text: I have been using this for about 6 years - my boys all love it!  I chose to start them on Almond Milk instead of Cow's milk as babies, so the flavor to them is completely normal.  It's not exactly what I want to put on my cereal or in my coffee.  My kids love it on the cereal or in their oatmeal.  I frequently bake with it, and I have found the consistency to be an excellent alternative to dairy.<br />I pay $1.69 for 1 32 oz container at Trader Joes.  Don't be suckered into paying $48 for a 12 pack!  That's over $4 a container... what a rip-off!

review/summary: Good, But Not Great.
review/text: I've been looking over some alternatives to dairy drinks to go with my meals. Plus, I might add the meals of my little boy (3.5 years). So, I was looking around in a nearby Trader Joe's  and found this interesting Pacific Natural Foods Organic Almond non-dairy beverage. It has a good, if somewhat bland, flavor and goes down easily very much like a low-fat milk. The calories per serving are moderate but the fat is a little high. I should add that the fat is non-saturated and non-trans and there is no cholesterol. The 50-50 sodium to potassium ratio is about ideal. I think the drink is a little low in protein that I should substitute it for milk in my boy's diet. All in all, I'm favorably impressed and this was my first experience with an almond beverage. I'd have to rate it good, but not great.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Taste is horrid
review/text: I've tried several brands of almond milk and coconut milk (granted, I don't usually pay attention to if it's organic or not, this may one of the few organic options). I picked this up at the store as they were out of the coconut milk I usually get. This stuff tastes so bad, especially the smell. It has a faint smell of almonds, but a bitter soapy smell and tastes like soapy water. Maybe it's an acquired taste, but it was bad enough I wish I'd read a review first, and therefore thought I'd better leave one!<br /><br />Also, this is the same stuff I tried, but they may have reformulated it (my package didn't look quite the same, and it said "now with 25% less sugar").

review/text: I agree with the other reviews that said this did not have enough spice, not at all.  I mean when I buy a chocolate that has chili in it, I expect it to have a kick, but this had no spice or even a little bit of a kick to it.  It just tasted like chocolate.  If you want a good chocolate bar with chili that you can actually taste then I would suggest "Chuao Chocolate Bar: Spicy Maya"  It is so good and amazing!!!  Dont get me wrong, this is a great chocolate but dont expect a chili kick to it.

review/summary: Just enough spiciness to make it interesting
review/text: Someone brought a couple of Lindt Chocolates to a meeting at work, and this Chili bar was a big hit!<br />It has silky smooth dark chocolate, and after you eat it leaves a bit of lingering chili flavor.  Just enough to make it interesting, not too much to make it too spicy for those who don't like spicy foods. Just perfect for a candy bar.<br /><br />I would have raved more about this  wonderful chocolate bar, because I really liked it... But then I tried the second bar brought to the meeting and was totally blown away by its taste <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HQPI8Q">Lindt Excellence Intense Orange Dark Chocolate Bar, 3.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>.  I immediately had to order the Intense Orange to have it all to myself.<br /><br />Update 5/12/11<br /><br />I came back to order more when I saw the price really has gone up from $27 (eligible for free shipping) to $39.99 plus shipping. When  price fluctuates this much I use a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon.  This tool is called  "Online Price Alert".  This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top.  I find this tool to be very helpful.

All are very high quality melt on your tongue decadent chocolate. I can't even eat other brands like Ghiardelli anymore, Lindt is far superior.<br /><br />The chili mixes very well with the rich dark creamy chocolate. It is a very subtle warmth sensation on the back of the throat not hot on the tongue burning heat. The subtlety is perfect as it does not distract from the delicious chocolate it simply enhances it. The ancient Mayans would have used this as currency!

review/text: I love these, at first you taste dark succulent melt in your mouth chocolate, and shortly after, a nice burn comes along to heat up your mouth.  If you're prone to heartburn from spicy foods, I'd avoid them, but otherwise these are definitely very tasty.  The chili doesn't seem to affect the flavor of the chocolate at all, it just adds heat, so it's just a really good chocolate with a slight heat to follow it.  Good stuff.

First off, the fragrance of strawberries was very strong and it is one of the most unusual flavors I have ever experienced.  In the long term, however, I found the green peppercorn flavor to be overpowering and I did not want to go back to have more chocolate since all I could think about was the green peppercorn.  Hope this helps.  It is definitely interesting and worth trying once, although I won't buy it again.

review/summary: Relatively Better Hachez Bar
review/text: As is, Cocoa D'Arriba consists of the best and natural ingredients only; no emulsifier, no artificial Vanillin. Concerning the high ingredient quality and business ethics, these are huge pluses. However, as most reviewers have complained, there is barely any chocolate taste, let alone the fact that it is not rich or fulfilling for that matter. This is most likely due to the fact that Cocoa D'Arriba is ultra-refined (14 microns) to generate a smooth and mellow taste. That is, the chocolate is over-refined, thus very little has remained from the original rich chocolate taste. You can run into the same problem in olive oil industry, where sometimes the oil is ultra-refined during pressing, which brings about the lack of actual olive taste and thus character. Too sad.<br /><br />Hachez Orange Bar 77% Cocoa is certainly a more successful product in the series, however. The natural orange-oil in it brings about a very mellow yet significant and pleasing orange flavor to this dark chocolate bar. It definitely adds  much flavor and gives some character to this over-refined chocolate bar.

review/summary: Very mild with some subtle orange flavor, and distinct bitterness
review/text: This is a high-quality chocolate made with all natural ingredients, but not my favorite. It's got a very mild taste that to me is very far from chocolate. It lacks that smooth, fatty rich taste on the tongue. The bitterness, however, is definitely in here when you first chew it, with an orange-y finish that increases in intensity in your mouth. It's an interesting effect, but I can't say that I love this. The bitterness lingers for a while, so be aware if you're used to very sweet chocolates.<br /><br />According to what little German that I can understand, this chocolate is handmade (since 1890) and made without coloring or preservatives. It's beautifully wrapped and makes a wonderful gift (I got it from a German friend), but just be sure that the person likes bitter chocolate before you buy this. Price written on the back is 2.2 Euro.

All-in-all, a very good "emergency meat" product with a good flavor and unique texture (sort of like wood particle board if it were made from ham).<br /><br />The pull-tab can is a little hard to open, so I wouldn't recommend this product for anyone with arthritis or grip strength issues. You'll find a bit of gelatinous goo inside, but not a lot.<br /><br />I wanted to slice it longways to fry and it was a little tricky to slice this way due to its elliptical shape. I browned the slices in a non-stick pan with no oil and it was very tasty.<br /><br />All things considered, this is one of the best canned meat products I've ever eaten. Given its long, multi-year shelf life, I can't think of any reason not to keep a few cans in the cupboard at all times.<br /><br />Ingredients are listed as ham cured with water, salt, sugar, sodium phosphates, carrageenan, sodium erythorbate and sodium nitrite.<br /><br />Nutrition info for a 2 oz. serving (8 per container) is as follows: 100 calories (60 from fat), 7g total fat (10% of daily value based on a 2,000 calorie diet), 2g saturated fat (11% DV), 0g trans fat, 40mg cholesterol (13% DV), 620mg sodium (26% DV at time of canning), less than 1g carbohydrates, less than 1g sugars and 9g of protein.

review/text: Edison, Oppenheimer, Einstein, Dyson...some of the worlds greatest scientist would be slack jawed in amazement if presented with the savoury bounty that inhabits this innocous tin of meat. Man's Genius was pushed further up the hill of evolution by this single minded brilliance.<br />I used to buy cured meat at the delicatessen, and then after several weeks in a warm cupboard of my Little Rock Mansion i would always be dissapointed to discover the large colony of fly's that had now set up their own version of Utopia on what had been set aside for my eating!<br /><br />NO MORE HOWEVER!!! Now i can store the tin in a cupboard and the fly's gather at my window sobbing, their old home laid waste after the aluminum revolution of ham wrapping. Buy some today and say no to insect invasion!! It's the only choice!

review/text: I have this in my emergency food supplies. I sometimes have some without an emergency though. It's very good. Has a decent ham taste different from spam ( at least I think so) & makes very good ham salad. Also good in an omlet or a side to eggs. Very good stuff.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I am so pleased with this product.  The ham has a great flavor.  It is also just the right size for me.  I plan on buying two or three more of them because they are "prepper friendly."  No, I am not preparing for an apoc experience.  I simply like to keep a stock of good food on hand.  This ham is safe in the can for around 5 years.  If you want to have something on hand for unexpected guests then this is the thing to buy.  It's a product of Denmark.  Everyone knows that Denmark has the best hams.<br /><br />The price is more than right and the ease of use is, well, easy.  Did I mention that I really like this ham?

review/summary: Burgers' Smokehouse Biscuit Ham
review/text: I received a ham and 4 packages of the biscuit sized ham slices as a Christmas gift (2007) and must say the ham was wonderful, but the small biscuit sized slices were the biggest hit with my family.  We used them for our family gathering at breakfast and they went like hot cakes!  The small ones asked for more!  Perfect for children because of the tenderness and being so lean.  Just found their website - gotta have more!

review/summary: Buy for Tooth Benefit, Not Taste
review/text: As sugar-free gums go, this gum is awful.  The taste dissipates in no time, and the gum itself is far from elastic.<br /><br />Yet I still buy it.  Why?  Because it uses only XYLITOL as its sweetener, a substance that actually reverses tooth decay (minor reversal, mind you, but, well... I'll take anything).  It's actually GOOD for teeth.<br /><br />Other gums on the market that taste better have XYLITOL as an ingredient, but they also include other sugar-free sweeteners.<br /><br />Here's what Wikiipedia says about XYLITOL:  "Xylitol is a 'toothfriendly' sugar. In addition to not encouraging tooth decay (by replacing dietary sugars), xylitol may actively aid in repairing minor cavities caused by dental caries. Recent research[7] confirms a plaque-reducing effect and suggests that the compound, having some chemical properties similar to sucrose, attracts and then "starves" harmful micro-organisms, allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption."<br /><br />On top of all this, XYLITOL might actually improve bone density.<br /><br />Taste?  Not so good.  Benefit? Priceless.

review/summary: Ghost Pepper Starter Kit.
review/text: The first thing you need to know is that Ghost Peppers, or Naga Jolokias, rate out at 1,000,000<br />Scovilles. If you're not familiar with his scale, the hottest jalapeno maxes out at 5000 Scoville<br />units. Do the math.<br /><br />Now for the good news. The reason I call this a Starter Kit is because it contains no Ghost Pepper<br />extract, only powder. And its mixed with Habaneros, mangos, and lime juice, and tomato paste to<br />derate this down to a stated 22,000 Scovilles (according to the label), but I'd bet green money this<br />is closer to about 100,000. Its damn hot!<br /><br />I think this would be good on chicken in particular, sort of like a hot/sweet BBQ sauce. Be prepared<br />for a good long burn. Minus 1 star for the overuse of habanero/jolokia powder.

We have subscribed to this product for several months, and it's convienient to have it shipped. That said, I wish Amazon offered other less expensive decaf coffee options. The value is good, but after many rounds of drinking this coffee, I just don't like the taste. It has a very waxy aroma--not unusual for decaf--but, still, I'd love to see some more options.

review/summary: Try It!
review/text: If you've never had real Swiss fondue, you're really missing something special.  My only regret is that I live in an area that usually doesn't get cold enough to really enjoy fondue to its fullest.  To compensate (and because we love winter), my wife and I often go to the mountains where it does snow and when we do, one of the first things we enjoy is Swiss fondue.<p>I've found that the cheeses in this assortment make a wonderful and very authentic Swiss fondue.  Just be sure to have a loaf of crusty French bread handy as well as white wine and kirsch.  And don't skimp on the kirsch; it really makes the fondue special.<p>My family and I have found that fondue is best served the traditional Swiss way...as a main course.  It's just too filling for an appetizer and just so good you want to eat your fill!  There's nothing quite as relaxing as a good fondue on a cold winter's night.  This cheese assortment is the first really authentic fondue assortment I've found since my days of backpacking and hitchhiking around Europe.<p>I really can't praise this cheese assortment highly enough.  You really have to make a fondue yourself and taste how good it is to believe it.  Try it!  Please!  Once you do, you'll become an addict!

review/summary: Our first fondue experience wasn't what it should have been
review/text: Our first experience with fondue and I'm totally willing to concede that it's probably our inexperience with fondue.  Bought everything you can expect at a fondue party (we've been researching for months).  The chocolate fondue was a huge success however this product didn't live up to expectations.<br /><br />The flavors together were a sort of sharp cheese mix which we enjoyed however it was stringy and never truly melted into what you would expect in a fondue cheese pot.  We 'may' purchase this again to try however we're thinking of going with another cheese fondue mix (mexican anyone?).  We'll see<br /><br />Again the flavor was great and even following the directions on how to handle the fondue if it's stringy didn't seem to work.  Oh well.  Live and learn :-)

review/text: I don't know why Science Diet is being referred to as junk food, as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market. A lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be. But regardless, my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine. After some comparisons, Science Diet Mature Adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food. Both my cats, the younger one and the older (10) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it. They both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them. My younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy :)

review/summary: The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?
review/text: I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Kitty Junk Food
review/text: We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.

review/summary: Not minced, this is ground beef
review/text: Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef.  My cat ONLY likes minced.  Not chunks, not ground.  Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.<br /><br />I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.  The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all.

review/summary: Not minced
review/text: I ordered this because it is Science Diet and it says it is minced. Well, it is NOT minced and my cats do not like it. It is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they can't eat it. I am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too. Will not be buying it again. Returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so I would be losing money.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: All By-Product & Corn -- Don't Waste Your Money!
review/text: I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: Vinegar Packed!
review/text: This item was delivered on 9/20/12 and the bottle label was different.  It had a yellow and green background color and more importantly, stated "Green Peppercorns in Vinegar."  Of course the web site has a different label and advertises green peppercorns in brine which is what I was seeking.  Don't know if this is a onetime event due to an inventory mistake or what but just keep in mind that Amazon's policy is NO RETURNS ON FOOD ITEMS (including wrongly shipped food items).  I had to do a work around with the Amazon Returns online process (used a different refundable item to get a chat line open) and did manage a refund.  That's the good news.  The bad news is it took a lot more time than it should have to resolve an Amazon error.  If Amazon doesn't fix this issue (i.e., refunding ALL incorrectly shipped items that cannot be returned), I suggest not fooling around and just disputing charges directly with your credit card company and let Amazon sort it out on their time.

review/summary: good value, but
review/text: These are good tasting green peppercorns, slightly spicier than the brand I used to buy in the grocery store. They also have a little more of a "green" taste to them.<br />I cook regularly with green peppercorns (they also go great in tuna salad or tuna sandwiches). I recently moved to an area of the country that does not seem to know anything about green peppercorns. NONE of my local grocery stores stock green peppercorns, blank stares when I inquire to store employees. Sure, they are available in local specialty stores, but are very pricey.<br />With this 6-pack I now have at least a year's supply.

review/text: Agree-buying peppercorns at the grocery store can require a small loan. These are excellent quality at a great price.  Makes a great gift for that peppercorn afficianado. Light brine does not alter their taste.<br /><br />If you like that dash of peppercorns in your cooking, such as steak au poivre, these are wonderful tasty peppercorns that provide a nice dash of flavor.<br /><br />Consider grinding them up and adding a dash of peppery accent to your nice sauces and gravies. Just perfect.

review/summary: It's good, but a little overly mild
review/text: I love chamomile, especially when the weather gets colder. I was especially excited to give this product a try after hearing about one of the other flavors via Amazon Vine, so I went out of my way to keep my eyes open for this on the shelves of various supermarkets. I have to say that I'm somewhat underwhelmed.<br /><br />Now normally you don't have to brew a chamomile bag too overly long to really start getting flavor from it, but this one I had to steep for a longer period of time. If you like a strong cuppa, you'll want to either brew this for a very long time or you'll want to use two tea bags as one of the other reviewers recommends. This sort of irritates me, as I shouldn't have to use two teabags to get a stronger flavor. This won't bother everyone, but it does bother me somewhat.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, it's not bad once you tease out a bolder flavor. If you want mild you can easily get that out of this, but this is better when you let it steep for as long as possible. The pineapple isn't a very strong flavor here, which I preferred. I don't know that I'd have liked it if the pineapple overwhelmed the chamomile, but if you're hoping for a big pineapple taste then you'll be disappointed. Where this does very well is that when this is at its strongest, you don't have to use much or any sweeteners. It could be drunk without, if you don't have sweeteners or if you choose to go without.<br /><br />Overall this is decent but I think I'll probably pass on this particular flavor of chamomile tea from Lipton in the future, or at least not go out of my way to purchase a whole box. On a side note, I want to warn that the tea bags are fairly fragile and that when removing the string, you have to be gentle. I've torn one of the bags because I was a little too quick when detaching the string.

review/summary: Favorite Coffee
review/text: We love Cafe 1820 and used to get it from flight attendant friends of ours when they would fly to Costa Rica. Apparently this is a very popular coffee with International travelers from the US and can be found very inexpensively in certain grocery stores in Costa Rica. Unfortunately it's not sold here, and when we moved away from our friends, our sources dried up - until we found it on Amazon.com! The price is a lot higher than what we used to pay, but it's worth it. I stocked up with my first order, which helped to offset the shipping cost, so it wasn't so bad. We like this much better than Starbucks, Seattles Best, or Duncan Donuts coffee. It's very rich and smooth, and the aroma is outstanding. After I ordered, Amazon sent me an e-mail offering an automatic replenishment program where they'll ship you a certain number of bags each month. I may sign up when we get low on coffee again. I highly recommend Cafe 1820 and I'm a coffee addict!

review/text: If what I ordered and what I received were actually the same, why didn't the label say Flowering Orange Pekoe Tea? It did say Darjeeling Tea, Tippy Golden FOP, Camelia sinensis. It did not brew up with the bright Orange color I expected from my days at Standard Brands Tea purchasing facility in NYC. It may have been a case of paying your workers peanuts and getting monkeys as workers. It may have been a substitution. "Hay Charlie! We are out of orange pekoe. This turkey will never know the difference." It could have been an honest mistake by the printer, or that monkey could have been there and left the Flowering Orange Pekoe off the label to save time and ink. Who knows?

review/summary: BEWARE THESE ARE FROM VIET NAM NOT NORTH ATLANTIC
review/text: I purchased these thinking they were Harvested in the North ATLANTIC.  Yet when the box arrived it clearly states that it is a "PRODUCT OF VIET NAM".  I don't trust any fish from Southeast asia. The box arrived today and I haven't opened it up yet and plan on returning it for fraudulent advertising. If it doesn't bother you to purchase from VIET NAM, then go ahead and purchase it.  I wanted NORTH ATLANTIC WHICH THIS CLEARLY STATES IN THE DESCRIPTION.  Therefore, I gave it a one-star review.

review/text: A little above average, this coffee fits the time of year. Decided to mix it with a few more varieties of coffee beans, and came up, well, let's just say that it is being used daily. Had a couple of pots with the Hazelnut alone and it was a little better than average. Will I buy again? I seriously doubt it for it is not a very serious and worth repeating type of coffee. All the flavor coffees are considered by many to be the bottom of the barrel in terms of quality and presence, so they become the perfect mix for adding flavor. Wether that is true or not I have to agree on the fact that non flavor coffee is the better buy. 3.5 Stars.

review/text: It is the height of luxury and convenience to have fresh coffee beans delivered to my mailbox, and at a lesser price than I can buy them in the store.  We can always have the best coffee, freshly ground, and perfctly brewed.  What's not to like?

review/summary: Great cake flour
review/text: This flour is great in cakes and gives them a much lighter texture than say regular all purpose flour.  This cake flour is also made from soft winter wheat which sounds like a gimmick of some kind but it makes a difference in cakes.  The main differences between this and all purpose are that it is finer and contains much less gluten which is great for breads but makes cakes doughy especially if over mixed.  I will sometime use this flour if I want to lighten up one of my existing recipes by replacing 1/2 or 1/3 of the AP flour like if I want a more fluffy Madeline but still have a good crumb.  This flour is definitely not for bread as it lacks the gluten required but it is great for a perfect cakes (I used it in my three tier wedding cake).  Also note that this is not self rising but I prefer that as I can control the amount of leavening agent and salt.  This stuff is awesome for light and airy southern style biscuits ( I can't believe I ever used all purpose).  The flour comes sealed in a bag inside the box which seems to hold the approx 8 cups that I get out of each and although it pre sifted i always sift again for good measure.  Happy Baking!

review/summary: Great cake flour at a great price
review/text: Better price buying here than at the store (it costs anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 less). Cake flour is better for cakes in that it provides a nicer crumb, not as dense than All PUrpose flour. This flour, while I still sift it, is hardly in need of it, no lumps or dry "rocks" in it. Will buy again. Great delivery speed too.

review/summary: Great Cereal for toddlers
review/text: Nestle Cerelac is a great tasting cereal for toddlers. My toddler would spit out Gerber, Best Earth and Beech Nuts cereals. But Nestle celerac he loves it. I mix the cerelac with regular milk, not water.<br /><br />I use to drive about 30 miles away from my house to buy this cerelac. No stores around my area carried them, and I live in NYC (now one store carries it but only the rice one). I was so excited when I found them at Amazon last year. I immediately ordered a case of 4 cans with free super saver shipping (4 can package costed $25.71). This saved me time, $ from gas and mileage on my car; and its delivered to my doorstep. Thank you Amazon.

review/summary: toddler nutrition
review/text: My mom said that when I was a kid they use to put this in my milk... she said it made  me solid... I tried it on my son who is 15 months old to add to his daily nutrition. I put this is his toddler formula and he loves it. I know this is not the only reason he is big but I believe it has helped him. He is in the 98% of his height and weight class... considering I am only 4'9 anything I can do to make sure he grows all he can is good (dad is 5'9). I don't feed him junk food and he isn't fat but he weighs 31 lbs. Because this product contains honey I would not recommend it for children under 1 year old.

review/summary: Excellent, product, fast delivery
review/text: My husband and I have been ordering cerelac for a year now. We transitioned from the wheat and milk to the wheat, milk and honey after our daughter turned one. This breakfast cereal has been a God send for us as working parents, it is easy to fix, its clearly our babies favorite food and it is nutritious without all the sodium/sugars you may find in regular cereal. I highly recommend this product.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPBXG">Nestle Cerelac, Honey and Wheat with Milk, 14.11-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)</a>

review/text: I am 20 years old, and no I don't have a baby, I actually order cerelac for myself !! It is one of the most delicious things that I have ever tasted in my life, haha I don't know if this makes me weird. I order a pack of 4 every other week. To all the parents, you should also try it!! I put a lot of cerelac in a bowl and add enough cold milk to make it a chunky dish instead of a soup like dish, AMAZING

review/summary: The best.
review/text: My 2 year old has been drinking this since she was switched to Nido Prebio. She was a picky eater and I always knew that she would get some quality nutrition while eating this. I mix it into her milk  before bed and she also loves it mixed with warm milk as a cereal for breakfast. It is sold in stores but it is not the same. It is thinner and she can tell the difference. This one costs more but she lives it.
