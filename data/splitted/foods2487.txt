review/summary: Mini Cookies with Mini Merits
review/text: These bags never close well, so if you are a compulsive bag-closer, forget about it. Ah, the taste you ask? Dry, and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form. Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original "Chips Ahoy!" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes.

review/text: I have a bit of a sweet tooth. I've tried to ignore it in times past, but the reality is that I want--NEED--a cookie from time-to-time as a welcome addition to my brown bag lunch. These 1.4 ounce single servings make that easy without overdoing it. If I bring one with me I know I'll only end up eating one package and not HALF of a 12 ounce package! Single servings help keep the portion size healthy while not killing your soul by ignoring your need for some desert...<br /><br />Reasonably priced and shipped to your door, these are a great purchase.

review/text: Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces.  My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes.  If you like cookie dough, you most likely will enjoy these.  I'll stick with a crunchy, less sweet cookie.

review/summary: Are We Reviewing Our Mistakes Or These Cookies?
review/text: Wow.  So far, two two-star reviews.  One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of "calms" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not "crispy" cookies, or the blurb would say "crispy," rather than "chewy."  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order.

Arrived in perfect condition. Reason I went through Go Coffee Go, instead of Doma direct, was free shipping. GCG's price through Amazon is good, but you are going to have to pay shipping. Maybe someday they will have this through Amazon with Free Super Saver Shipping, so check back. Whatever you do, don't pass up this fantastic roast!

Also, for a caffeine free herbal tea, this one has a very good base flavor and brews quickly.  I don't like many herbals because they take too long to brew and/or taste watered down. This makes a nice hot or cold drink and is a great picker upper for those trying to cut out caffeine.

review/text: I got my first cup of this wild sweet orange tea in a cute coffee shop and then fell in love with its great aroma and tasty flavors. Then I found it at a high price (~$6/box) sold in single boxes at Starbucks. Naturally the next thing for me to do was to check on Amazon and found that if I buy them in big package (6 boxes) I can get this delicious tea at &lt;$5/box. So I bought a big pack and had been enjoying it till I grew a little tired of the flavor... I'm sure that after a little break away from it I will continue to enjoy my sweet orange tea time again! Or maybe next time I should buy the variety pack :)

Is there a shortage of oranges or something? But clearly I'm willing to pay the price - nothing else tastes like this. Makes great iced tea as well.

review/summary: Roland Pesto is crapola!
review/text: Let me just say up front that if I am hungry i will eat about anything.  This Pesto (without any pine nuts) is terrible.  Save you money.  It had good reviews and since I live in the Baja I thought i would try it since it had such good reviews and we can not buy this sort of stuff here where I live.<br /><br />Honestly, save you money.  There is not really a "Pesto flavor" with this product and it has a rancid sort of "off" taste to it.  Six very small (3 oz) jars are over $20.00.  It is fairly "pricey" to start with and since it has a terrible taste then it is ridiculously priced in my opinion.<br /><br />I am so irritated i bought this crapola and of course Amazon will not accept a return on it.  My reccomendation is the Classico brand "Traditional Basil Pesto sauce and spread".  I paid, i believe $2.00 a jar for the Classico brand of pesto on sale at a WalMart.  The jar size is 8.1 oz and i had five large meals with the Classico pesto sauce which has a wonderful flavor.  I boiled some Johnsonville sausage in a pan and afterwards boiled my pasta in the same pan of sausage water.  Had the Classico Brand of pesto with my pasta and the flavor was wonderful!  The Classico Pesto sauce was incredible on the sliced sausage.  So i tried to duplicte the same meal with the Roland Petso sauce and i barely ate half of it and tossed the rest.  I won't be eating the remainder of this RolandPestoCrapola.  I realize that individual tastes vary greatly but I can NOT imagine anyone choosing the Roland Pesto.

However, the jars are really small and the price is relatively high.  I use two jars per half a bag of 'Delicate-Cut Noodles' by Bali-Spice in order to have that strong basil taste.  Maybe San Remo does make a larger jar but I have not seen it on Amazon.  Still...I do recommend this sauce as a delicious change from the usual tomato sauces.  It's quite delectable!!

review/text: I had recently bought an Hawaiian Ice Machine from Great Northern which we love.  The kids loved the flavors and the added cones and straws are an added bonus.  A little pricey but delivered to your door and ready to go.

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: I purchased the 6-pack of these lemon tea cookies and waited with great anticipation for the melt-in-your-mouth, powdered sugar-covered shortbread lemon tea cookies I was expecting; what I received was 6 boxes of cookies that tasted like chemicals. I don't know if they were old and had gone off or had been stored in some plastic container that had leached the plastic into the cookies or if the makers just used some sort of artificial lemon flavoring rather than actual lemon but any lemon flavor they might've had was nearly undetectable, overpowered by a medicinal chemical flavor. They kind of tasted like Bactine smells. Needless to say I would not recommend these cookies to anyone but if you really want to try them let me know, I still have 5 unopened boxes... (To be fair, I can't say for sure ALL the boxes tasted like this, just the one I happened to open. I will not, however, be trying any of the other boxes I still have.)

review/text: These cookies are simply scrumptious! I gave my mother some as a gift, since she loves lemon flavored desserts. What a hit! They became her instant favorites, and she begged me to get her some more. They are small and round, about the size of a large marble, with a crisp, light consistency that just melts away in your mouth, covered with powdered sugar for sweetness, combined with that tart little zing of lemon. A very elegant and grown-up sort of cookie. I love them, too. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Oh Myyyyy
review/text: Now, I'm a Southern girl through and through, but I'm going to let you in on a little secret...I was born a Yankee. Yup, born in South Bend, Indiana and raised in Michigan until I was ten, when we moved to Tennessee. As a Michigander, I can say with complete confidence that Michigan blueberries are the best blueberries in the entire world. Blueberry season comes around and the state explodes into a world of deliciousness. You can stop at just about any roadside stand and get a ten pound box of blueberries, or you can head out to one of those you-pick places, if you're feeling particularly energetic (or you've got young kids...I'm looking at you, Mom!). Blueberries played a huge role in my childhood. We would snatch up all the blueberries we could during the season and freeze them. Blueberry pancakes, muffins, and cobblers were served all year round, but my favorite blueberry dish was blueberry ice cream. It's a real complicated recipe, y'all ready? You take frozen blueberries and pour cold milk over them. Yup. We're a simple folk.<br /><br />But my love of blueberries has come with me through my travels and life path. So when I spotted a blueberry matcha, my immediate reaction was one of "Um, heck yes, please!" The scent when I open the package is to die for. Oh my goodness, blueberry. In your face, juicy, sweet blueberry. My mouth is watering already.<br /><br />The taste? Oh my. No, no, let me rephrase that. Imagine that I'm George Takei. Oh myyyyyy. Yep, it's that good. George Takei "Oh myyy" inducing good. You know when you go into one of those bath and body stores, and you pick something blueberry up, smell it, and immediately tell your wife you wish you had something that tastes as good as it smells and then you lick it and it just plain doesn't taste as good as you want it to? No? Just me? Well, this matcha tastes the way those soaps smell. Intensely blueberry and incredibly delicious. Juicy is just the word that comes to mind with every sip...it's incredible. I have a few blueberry fans among my friends who will go ape over this.<br /><br />This review brought to you by the letter M and the number 2, which is the number of cups of matcha I've had this morning in an effort to taste them all and get my reviews written...and it's only nine o'clock. Pray for my wife, folks, she's in for a crazy morning.

review/summary: Fresh, plump, juicy blueberry Matcha!
review/text: Yummeh. Blueberries are not my favorite fruit, but when I opened my package I knew I was going to love this just as much as the mango. The scent was strong blueberry! It reminded me of fruit leather, deep purple, chewy, yummy homemade fruit leather by the hippie auntie I used to have. Ah sense memory, I love it so.<br />So I whisked up this delight with the plan to make a couple little lattes - one with soymilk, one with almond and one with regular. I don't know, I just wanted to taste the nuances and find my favorite pairing I guess! Also to see which milk went best with fruit flavoured matcha.<br /><br />Honestly though, I really enjoyed this one sans milk - just with some sugar. (I also experimented with sweetener, and found I prefer sugar over agave for my matcha).<br /><br />The froth! I got a crazy amount of froth with no clumps in this batch. I definitely credit the quality of the matcha for that, because my whisk skills are shoddy at best. That's when I knew I was in for a treat today. This blueberry matcha in particular was very smooth. The berry taste fluctuated from sip to sip - one sip it was a tart not quite ripe berry, the second it was an overly plump, huge juicy ripe berry. The aftertaste was definitely the latter. The flavouring felt more strong in this batch than I expected, but I loved that very much. What a deal :D Again, I love that this company uses natural flavouring - it really shows in the quality of this matcha that it tastes like the berries, not like a candy.<br />With almond milk, the matcha latte tastes almost like a baked good - a blueberry matcha scone or shortbread. The soymilk tasted, well, like soymilk (I think it was my least favorite of the 3). With hot frothed 2% milk it was very sweet. I find hot milk to be naturally sweet, so that probably accounts for it!<br /><br />Last, but certainly not least, I had it as an iced latte. (If you're wondering, with all this crazy matcha energy - I'm learning the ukulele!) I HIGHLY recommend enjoying these fruit flavour matchas from Red Leaf Tea as iced lattes. Oh my goodness! The fruit flavour just comes alive and honestly tasted like a blended real fruit smoothie. Of course, once I get a blended I will be making blended iced drinks 100% - but until then, the ice cubes will suffice.

review/summary: Mmmmm Matcha!
review/text: In the tea base and flavoring itself, is that the green matcha really nicely stands out even more so than in some of the other flavors I have bought. You know, the more I drink this the more I am loving it for that very reason. You lose none of the blueberry flavor mixing it with a shake, latte, smoothie, whatever... and the green matcha base comes out even MORE! Its like some magical blueberry matcha gnomes came in while I was not looking and sprinkled some mojo on it! Mmmmmm. Such an interesting flavor, as I continue to drink I seem to pick up different subtle nuisances in this tea mixture. I mean I am used to that in non matcha teas, but I have to say this is the first matcha, let alone a flavored matcha I have tasted something slightly different each and every time! Sometimes its just really fresh and refreshING, other sips I get more sweet, some sips I am getting far more of the matcha base with that vegetal buttery sensation, other times I get peppery note even! Its strange, and enjoyable.

review/text: The starfish included in this little gift is very likely not sustainably harvested. In fact just the opposite. Anyone who cares about the ocean or the environment should not buy this. OTOH, the idea of a bromeliad in a little crystal hanger is a lovely idea, and there are several other great products very similar to this, without the environmental consequences.<br /><br />What nice is that a bromeliad requires very little care, so even those with a black thumb can likely keep one for quite some time, thus making for a lasting gift.<br /><br />So, yes, a gift like this one is a good idea. Just not this particular version. Please.

review/text: Dave's Gourmet is known for its punchy hot sauces, but its pasta sauces are underrated... especially this one. Made in San Francisco from butternut squash harvested in Oregon's Willamette Valley, it's at once savory and sweet. It has such a filling flavor that even Parmesan cheese is beside the point. It's a great topping for gnocchi,pasta,etc. It's a wonderfully autumnal sauce. Bon appetit!

review/summary: the BEST sauce I ever had!!!
review/text: I have never written a review before...that's how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this sauce! I have never liked red tomato sauces of any kind and I've tried many. I usually make a white alfredo sauce for my pasta which is not exactly low fat and not the best choice for my slim down program. I was excited to find and try this sauce because I really like the taste of butternut squash. I didn't tell my husband what is was before he ate it because he's not a vegetable kind of guy and hesitates to try anything new. After I knew he liked it I told him. This is a great way to eat healthy (only 4 grams of fat per serving) and sooooooo tasty with just the right amount of sweetnesss. Amazon also has the best price on this sauce. Don't hesitate to try it...you won't be sorry. It's really a treat for me when I find a new food product I like. It's even more of a treat to find out it has good quality ingredients so it's good for us too!

I am  VERY leery of canned/jarred pasta sauce and almost always prefer to just make my own from scratch. However, this sauce is just divine! It has a very robust taste and is pleasantly sweet. I paired it with cheese ravioli and it was just perfect. I think that it would be great with just about any pasta. It is a pleasant change from a tomato based sauce and is very satisfying. I highly recommend!

review/summary: This stuff is incredible
review/text: When I first saw this sitting on a store shelf, my initial thought was, "what a great idea!"...<br /><br />After reading the (short & simple) list of ingredients, my next thought was something along the lines of, "what a welcome surprise - none of the non-food chemical smoke & mirror -like ick otherwise found in so many food products"...<br /><br />After opening the jar, I thought, "it looks 'real', & looks fresh"...<br /><br />After tasting it the first time, I thought, "WOW - this stuff is FANTASTIC!" - & then my mind & tastebuds were 'off to the races', as I pondered what other ways the sauce could be used - it would rock more than just pasta... this stuff is the kind of wondrous food product that upon discovery, launches one into a kind of, 'I've got to tell ___ about this' bit of excited celebration... you want to share the news with others, & honestly, a part of me was practically skipping inside (the part that 'cheerleads' transformative outcomes which render vegetables-that-get-a-bad-rap into a form of taste heaven, let alone versions of such that one could previously only dream of)...<br /><br />The taste of this sauce is such a pleasant surprise - don't let the 'looks like solid squash' aspect fool ya - there's a wonderful dance that all of the ingredients participate in, & the reaction I have with practically every taste of it is one of renewed surprise at how incredibly flavorful this sauce is (& consistent with another person's comments in a recent review, I found myself wondering about the potential of eating the sauce as a 'soup').<br /><br />Whoever was involved with creating, & ultimately fine-tuning, this delightful combination of ingredients (let alone having it turn out so darn pretty), deserves every accolade in whatever categories this sauce might ever qualify in, when it comes to the official 'food world' recognizing the achievement... the accolades emanating from blown away customers who taste it will be ongoing...

review/summary: Best pasta sauce I've ever had
review/text: I do most of the cooking in our house, and most of the dishes as well, so most dinners involve only one or two pots.  Consequently, pasta is a staple.  I like red sauces because of their lower calorie content, and my wife and son prefer white and cheese sauces.  Pasta night regularly involves the wrinkling of noses.<br /><br />Lately, my wife has been on a winter squash kick.  While shopping at a local grocery store, we bought a jar of 'Dave's Gourmet Butternut Squash Pasta Sauce' on Saturday on a whim since my wife really like's winter squash.<br /><br />Sunday, for lunch, we had it over ravioli. My son, who puts cheese on everything, added none to his bowl of ravioli and sauce.  This sauce is fabulous.  It's sweet, but just sweet enough. It's spicy, but just spicy enough.  The sauce immediately became our favorite pasta sauce, bar none.<br /><br />Today, we picked up four more jars. If it's still in stock in early December, I will probably give it as Christmas gifts.<br /><br />Yum!

review/summary: Good enough to be served as a soup
review/text: I found this sauce in our neighborhood Marshall's...lol, yup.  I don't normally shop there but I was bored one day and since it just opened, I wanted to check it out.  Since I was bored, I was "digging" for a good deal and taking my time looking through their stuff.  I made it to the really small section of foods, cooking utensils, pans and such when I spotted this sauce.  I had butternut squash soup at a wedding once and it was pretty good, so I scanned it with my iPhone to check it out.  It got great ratings and it was only $4.99 a bottle, half of its advertised price, so I gave it a shot.  That night, my wife made spinach and feta cheese perogies and used the butternut squash sauce and topped it with a little fresh ground pepper.  Ooooo mmmmmm geeeeeeee!!!!  Instantly I panicked cause I only bought one jar and I looooved this stuff.  I heated up a small bowl of it and added a little kosher salt and it tasted great all by itself.  Man, why haven't I heard of it before? Well, needless to say, I've gone back and purchase their entire stock of the stuff and plan to go back and get their other sauces too.  Maybe my palet isn't as refined as some of the other critics (booooo!) that said they didn't like it, but I do like to try new foods all the time especially healthy ones and this ones all good to me:)<br />I did notice on Dave's website the sauces are $1 cheaper than amazon.  Hope this helps, enjoy!

review/summary: Award Winning Pasta Sauce
review/text: I've always been a fan of squash raviolis, but I had never heard of squash pasta sauce until I saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AYV8RS">Dave's Gourmet Butternut Squash Pasta Sauce - 25.5 Ounces</a> at Costco. It's hailed as the first of its kind-- "all-natural butternut-squash pasta sauce...made with squash ripened in Oregon's Willamette Valley." The product is manufactured in San Francisco, CA and is made of the highest quality ingredients (order of the ingredients on the label):<br /><br />* Butternut Squash<br />* Water<br />* Tomato Paste<br />* Red Bell Peppers<br />* Evaporated Cane Juice<br />* Butter<br />* Celery<br />* Onion<br />* Garlic<br />* Sea Salt<br />* Citric Acid<br />* Black Pepper<br /><br />It does contain dairy, so if you are lactose intolerance or a vegan, you should avoid this pasta sauce. Still, I'm happy to report that the pasta sauce is gluten-free.<br /><br />As for the taste, the biggest criticism I have is that it's one of the sweetest pasta sauces I've ever eaten. It's not sweet as in "candy sweet." It's what I would call "savory-sweet." The ingredients that hit your taste buds the most are butternut squash and red bell peppers. Because butternut squash is one of the sweetest squashes out there, it's expected that this sauce would exemplify that flavor. If the sweetness bothers you, there is a way to rectify that issue. For myself, I simply add more black pepper to it, preferably freshly cracked peppercorn. The pepper transforms it to more of a traditional savory taste. If you're a garlic lover, adding some more of this spice also helps.<br /><br />As for the texture, the sauce is a good consistency when you first open it, not too watery and not too thick. However, if you don't use up all the sauce with your first batch of cooking, it will thicken inside the fridge. It tastes good fresh or after being stored in the refrigerator for a little bit. The only problem with letting it sit in the fridge is that the sauce gets more difficult to pour out from the bottle because of its thickness. A little bit of water added to the remaining sauce will allow you to maximize the amount of leftover sauce.<br /><br />There are many products you can use this pasta sauce with. Of course, there is traditional plain pasta. I paired the sauce with Barilla Plus Penne Pasta, and I was very happy with the overall taste and flavor of the meal. I've also used the butternut squash on polenta and cheese raviolis, again wonderful pairings. I did add aged Parmesan Cheese, pepper, garlic, and salt to all of these dishes to help tone down the sweetness of the sauce. The label also suggests using the sauce with tortellinis and lasagna. Basically, you can use this pasta sauce with any type of pasta dish and be assured that you will have "a delicious change of pace" to your meal.<br /><br />While doing some additional research about this pasta sauce, I discovered that it's an award-winning recipe. In 2009, Dave won a Gold Award for Outstanding Pasta Sauce (N.A.S.F.T.) for his Butternut Squash recipe. In fact, Dave's been winning awards for his tasty gourmet creations since 1994 when his Salute Dressing won the Outstanding Healthy/Nutritious Product (N.A.S.F.T). I'm very impressed at the amount of awards he's won, and I would be willing to try any of his other amazing products, especially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EKFBUE">Dave's Gourmet Organic Spicy Heirloom Marinara Pasta Sauce - 26 Ounces</a>. I highly suggest readers and potential consumers view all of Dave's award winning food products ([...]).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with this product. It's so good, I'm not ashamed to say that I like eating the sauce directly from the bottle (in small doses of course). I'm very happy that I visited Costco the day it was being featured. I wish that more non-bulk grocery stores offered samples because then I would have additional chances of discovering some fantastic products like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AYV8RS">Dave's Gourmet Butternut Squash Pasta Sauce - 25.5 Ounces</a>.

review/text: This sauce reminds me of the sauce my great-grandmother would make with canned tomatoes. This was so delicious, and I loved the sweetness of the sauce. If you prefer a more savory sauce just cut it with vegetable stock. I will definitely buy this again. Oh yeah, I found this cheaper in my local grocery store.

review/summary: OMG! We love this stuff!
review/text: We bought this 1 year ago and have not stopped buying it since. Last Nov/Dec Costco said it was seasonal at first because the manufacturer could not keep up with the demand. Well, its been at our Cosco for over 3 months now-I hope it's not seasonal anymore. We love this sauce. It is good on Ravioli and Tortalini but also good on Quinoa pasta with Feta and over veggies w/o pasta. Our family eats this almost every week. You won't be disapointed. BTW-we are gluten and dairy free and the butter in this sauce seems to be just fine for our family. Great stuff!

review/text: This sauce is really good. But I paid way to much on amazon for it. I wont do that again. for one jar I paid $25..for some reason I thought I was getting more then one jar...I think I am going to try to make this myself. I felt like I got ripped off. Maybe I should have read it closer. But all in all the sause is good.

review/summary: Love this sauce!
review/text: I picked up a jar of this sauce randomly the other week while at the grocery store, having never heard of Dave's products at all. SO happy I gave this a try! This sauce is so yummy, it's a little thick in the jar but works well with pasta. I think it has a hint of roasted red peppers in it (could be wrong?) and is just overall delicious. Like another reviewer mentioned, you really don't even parmesan cheese with with this sauce (and I'm someone who usually puts at least 1/2 cup of parmesan on my pasta, easily more). I put it on the other night and really thought the sauce was better without - never had that happen before!<br /><br />If you are curious about this sauce, please give it a try you won't be disappointed!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AYV8RS">Dave's Gourmet Butternut Squash Pasta Sauce - 25.5 Ounces</a><br />I served this with some chicken and cheese ravioli.  I expected that it would have a mellow, rather sweet butternut squash taste.  Instead, the predominate taste was that of the red bell peppers included in the sauce. I topped it with some parmesan, and it was just ok. I doubt that I'll serve this again.

review/summary: Best Hot Sauce in the World
review/text: I first tried Baron's West Indian Hot Sauce on my honeymoon in St. Lucia.  It added so much to my dining pleasure that I brought back a few bottles in my suitcase.  The scotch bonnet is a type of habenero.  What is unique about it is that it has a very fruity flavor along with the heat, and the mustard adds complexity.  The combination of fruit, heat, and spice is truly extraordinary.  I like it on fish, chicken, burgers, steaks, turkey sandwiches, egg sandwiches, french fries, and fruit, yes! Fruit!  If you want to completely blow your mind, try it on a wedge of drippy ripe mango.  It it is dynomite with omlettes and any egg dish at breakfast, no better way to start the day.  Just be careful who and where you kiss after eating this hot sauce.  I have also tried Glady's of St. Thomas, which is also excellent, I am a big fan.  Compared to Glady's I found that Baron's is more fruity, more consistant, and keeps better over long periods.

review/text: We first had this hot sauce on our honeymoon in St. Lucia and we were bummed that we couldnt bring any back with us.  However, we were able to find it here on Amazon.  I mistakenly had the shipping address incorrect (never changed to the new address) and once I noticed it and contacted Amazon and the seller, they were able to re-rout it after it had already been shipped.  I cant thank both the seller and Amazon for great customer service.  And the sauce is awesome, delicious and of course, HOT. Order a bottle and you wont be disappointed....unless you dont like spicy stuff!

review/summary: Einfach hervorragend
review/text: Habe diese Sauce mehr per Zufall mal in einem Asia-Supermarkt mitgehen lassen. Ich war sehr &uuml;berrascht, da ich bisher nur die Tabasco-&auml;hnlichen Essigbasierten Hot-Sauces gewohnt war. Eines vorweg: Die Sauce ist sehr scharf, dh f&uuml;r den normalen mitteleurop&auml;ischen Geschmack (F&uuml;r Chilli-Fanatiker wahrscheinlich eher im oberen Mittelfeld). Daneben, und das ist das besondere, hat sie auch einen vollen (sie enth&auml;lt auch Senf), in Ankl&auml;ngen sehr fruchtigen Geschmack (das macht die verwendete Chilli-Sorte). Daher eignet sie sich f&uuml;r eine Vielzahl von Gerichten, denen sie den letzten Geschmacks- und Sch&auml;rfekick zu geben vermag. Ich verwende sie zum Marinieren von Fleisch, in Saucen und Currys, aber auch in Suppen.<br />Auch nicht unwichtig: Ich habe keine "b&ouml;sen" Inhaltstoffe finden k&ouml;nnen.<br />Sofern man sie nicht eintrocken l&auml;sst, h&auml;lt sie sich auch sehr lange und hat daher einen Stammplatz in meinem K&uuml;hlschrank.

review/summary: H O T sauce with FLAVOR
review/text: Like most others in the reviews, I discovered this wonderful HOT sauce while on vacation in Saint Lucia. This is not your ordinary, run of the mill, so called hot sauce. It has a nice yellowish color, with red specks of goodness, (peppers) and is somewhat thick in consistency, as opposed to what you would expect to find in your typical hot sauce (Tabasco, Franks, Etc.)  This HOT sauce is H O T and has a LOT of flavor and character that seriously sets it apart from the afore mentioned sauces, no disrespect to them intended, I still love and use my Franks/Tabasco! BUT; Barons West Indian HOT Sauce is completely different: it is rather thick,(reminiscent of cheese dip) super tasty, and SUPER HOT! A little bit goes a  long  way! If you want just a touch of heat that is different from 'the red stuff', try Barons. If you don't like heat at all....STAY AWAY! If you don't mind some heat and are looking for something new to flavor your: tuna salad, cheese dip, pasta salad, mac & cheese, pizza, spaghetti, eggs, and the list goes on and on..... Barons West Indian hot sauce is woooooo....H O T.... but so good.

review/summary: Full of flavor and a variety of uses
review/text: Just got back from St. Lucia and purchased as much as I could of this Hot Sauce.  My first experience with it was on "Deviled Garlic Cheese Bread" at an upscale steakhouse in Rodney Bay, St. Lucia, West Indies.  When we tried this bread, which was mozzarella cheese and garlic on top of bread brushed with this hot sauce, we had no idea that we would experience so much flavor.  We ordered this bread about 4 more times during our stay there and ended up insisting that we know the secret.<br /><br />Since then, I've used this with a variety of other meals.  I've been known to pick up the Tabasco from time to time just because I want an interesting taste.  This Barron Hot Sauce is in a different league.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.  Also great as a gift for hot sauce lovers.

review/text: We went to St. Lucia on our honeymoon and stayed at Sandals resort.  The burger shack had a huge vat of this, and when I asked what it was they said it was the locally made hot sauce and warned me that it was super hot.  I tried it and instantly fell in love.  It is a mustard based hot sauce made with scotch bonnet peppers.  I have trouble finding very hot sauce that actually tastes good, and this really delivers.  I took home several bottles from St. Lucia and just recently ordered a couple off of Amazon.  As long as you like it hot and tasty, you will not be disappointed!  My favorite hot sauce and condiment bar none.

It's very hot, so if you like things mild it's not for you.  But it also has a great flavor.

Even my friends who usually do not like hot sauce fell in love with this fantastic sauce. If you love hot sauce you are in for a treat.  Baron's Saint Luican hot sauce is full of flavor and quite spicy and a little goes a long way. Great to cook with or sprinkle on your favorite dish.  Try it.  You will not be sorry.

review/summary: This Ready to Eat Meal Tastes Good
review/text: When hurricane season approaches, this is what we pick up for our emergency food rations.  The tuna salad is already mixed so there is no mess.  No can opener required.  This kit includes:<br /><br />2.9 oz. can of tuna salad<br />4.0 oz. snack cup of diced peaches<br />  foil wrapped pack of 6 crisp crackers<br />  chocolate chip cookie<br />  plastic fork/spoon<br /><br />It provides 500 calories.  I can assure you, having a chocolate chip cookie (even when it is dry) is a great comfort when your property is being shredded by howling winds.  These kits are packed well enough and light for travel, but not crush proof.  The soft lids peel right off without cutting fingers.<br /><br />I tried some MRE dehydrated hiking/hunting food.  Ugh!  I much prefer having my eggs in this tuna salad.  They are mixed with mayonaise, water chestnuts, carrots and celery.  The shelf life is one year if you can refrain from eating them that long.<br /><br />We enjoy eating these good tasting snacks when there are no emergencies.  We love premium quality Bumble Bee tuna.  It is Dolphin Safe.

review/summary: Great tasting tuna kit! Cookie, not so good.
review/text: This tuna kit is the best.  I've had the starkist brand a lot, but that one is so messy and hard to make.  With this one, all you do is pop the can open and enjoy delicious tuna on crackers! Speaking of which, there are never enough crackers in these kits to go with the amount of tuna, unless you heap the tuna on.  I like to keep an extra sleeve of crackers in my drawer at work to finish off the tuna.<br /><br />The tuna can looks small, but it is plenty for me.  The included peach cup is a nice touch to round out the lunch.<br /><br />The cookie on the other hand is bland, dry, brittle, and tasteless.  I'd almost prefer no cookie than what they have included in this kit.  They either need to drop the cookie all together or replace it with something a little better tasting.<br /><br />Despite the cookie, this kit is awesome, I will buy many more!

review/summary: So cheap! Great product!
review/text: I've tried this lunch kit before, seeing it on sale in the grocery store. It's a great concept, a "lunchable" for adults that doesn't need to be refrigerated. For $2.50/kit, it's also a great deal (especially with free shipping!). 500 calories for lunch isn't bad and the cookie can always be kept for later or given to someone else to cut calories further. I wouldn't recommend eating this everyday, as other reviewers have mentioned. Tuna has a high level of mercury, so you really want to limit yourself to eating 1 - 2 servings per week. I usually see the kits on sale for around $3, so it's not that great of a deal. However, it's really nice to have a case of 8 in the pantry. It's also something that can be used in food storage for emergencies.

I like my tuna and peaches cold, always have for some reason. I have one in the mini fridge, for when I get in my office in the morning; and bring an extra to put in for tomorrow. I love these along with a small juice pouch.<br /><br />I like the whole set: the tuna salad in the can with an easy open lid, the sweet juicy peaches, crackers for the tuna, and a cookie to top it off with. Yum! They go great with juice. This kit helps me avoid the community fridge, so I don't have to worry about the sorry excuse "I thought this was anybodys food in this fridge" when my tuna ends up missing.<br /><br />Luckily enough, I can shove the kit and pouch in the tiny Coke fridge of mine. For the price of this kit it's awesome! Plus it keeps me from the community fridge, it pays for itself right there!<br /><br />Yeah, this tuna deserves 5 stars! For the price and convienence, it's a steal. All the food is very good and full on flavor. I recommend this to anyone who loves tuna. Unfortunately Amazon no longer ships these 8 packs. I wish they would, cause it's a great combo.<br /><br />I also have a comment about one user complaining about it coming with some peaches; is it really that hard to toss those away? Plus, deduct 2 stars from a 5 star product just beause it gave extra accessories? I mean really, come on.

review/summary: Oh Myyyyy
review/text: Now, I'm a Southern girl through and through, but I'm going to let you in on a little secret...I was born a Yankee. Yup, born in South Bend, Indiana and raised in Michigan until I was ten, when we moved to Tennessee. As a Michigander, I can say with complete confidence that Michigan blueberries are the best blueberries in the entire world. Blueberry season comes around and the state explodes into a world of deliciousness. You can stop at just about any roadside stand and get a ten pound box of blueberries, or you can head out to one of those you-pick places, if you're feeling particularly energetic (or you've got young kids...I'm looking at you, Mom!). Blueberries played a huge role in my childhood. We would snatch up all the blueberries we could during the season and freeze them. Blueberry pancakes, muffins, and cobblers were served all year round, but my favorite blueberry dish was blueberry ice cream. It's a real complicated recipe, y'all ready? You take frozen blueberries and pour cold milk over them. Yup. We're a simple folk.<br /><br />But my love of blueberries has come with me through my travels and life path. So when I spotted a blueberry matcha, my immediate reaction was one of "Um, heck yes, please!" The scent when I open the package is to die for. Oh my goodness, blueberry. In your face, juicy, sweet blueberry. My mouth is watering already.<br /><br />The taste? Oh my. No, no, let me rephrase that. Imagine that I'm George Takei. Oh myyyyyy. Yep, it's that good. George Takei "Oh myyy" inducing good. You know when you go into one of those bath and body stores, and you pick something blueberry up, smell it, and immediately tell your wife you wish you had something that tastes as good as it smells and then you lick it and it just plain doesn't taste as good as you want it to? No? Just me? Well, this matcha tastes the way those soaps smell. Intensely blueberry and incredibly delicious. Juicy is just the word that comes to mind with every sip...it's incredible. I have a few blueberry fans among my friends who will go ape over this.<br /><br />This review brought to you by the letter M and the number 2, which is the number of cups of matcha I've had this morning in an effort to taste them all and get my reviews written...and it's only nine o'clock. Pray for my wife, folks, she's in for a crazy morning.

review/summary: Fresh, plump, juicy blueberry Matcha!
review/text: Yummeh. Blueberries are not my favorite fruit, but when I opened my package I knew I was going to love this just as much as the mango. The scent was strong blueberry! It reminded me of fruit leather, deep purple, chewy, yummy homemade fruit leather by the hippie auntie I used to have. Ah sense memory, I love it so.<br />So I whisked up this delight with the plan to make a couple little lattes - one with soymilk, one with almond and one with regular. I don't know, I just wanted to taste the nuances and find my favorite pairing I guess! Also to see which milk went best with fruit flavoured matcha.<br /><br />Honestly though, I really enjoyed this one sans milk - just with some sugar. (I also experimented with sweetener, and found I prefer sugar over agave for my matcha).<br /><br />The froth! I got a crazy amount of froth with no clumps in this batch. I definitely credit the quality of the matcha for that, because my whisk skills are shoddy at best. That's when I knew I was in for a treat today. This blueberry matcha in particular was very smooth. The berry taste fluctuated from sip to sip - one sip it was a tart not quite ripe berry, the second it was an overly plump, huge juicy ripe berry. The aftertaste was definitely the latter. The flavouring felt more strong in this batch than I expected, but I loved that very much. What a deal :D Again, I love that this company uses natural flavouring - it really shows in the quality of this matcha that it tastes like the berries, not like a candy.<br />With almond milk, the matcha latte tastes almost like a baked good - a blueberry matcha scone or shortbread. The soymilk tasted, well, like soymilk (I think it was my least favorite of the 3). With hot frothed 2% milk it was very sweet. I find hot milk to be naturally sweet, so that probably accounts for it!<br /><br />Last, but certainly not least, I had it as an iced latte. (If you're wondering, with all this crazy matcha energy - I'm learning the ukulele!) I HIGHLY recommend enjoying these fruit flavour matchas from Red Leaf Tea as iced lattes. Oh my goodness! The fruit flavour just comes alive and honestly tasted like a blended real fruit smoothie. Of course, once I get a blended I will be making blended iced drinks 100% - but until then, the ice cubes will suffice.

review/summary: Instant Favorite! Delicious!
review/text: Each sip of this Matcha was smooth and sweet, even though no sweetener was added. Its thickness made me imagine a sip of blueberry smoothie in my mouth, it even made me feel full after finishing the cup! It is a delightful experience. I also tried it iced which was delicious and refreshing.<br /><br />This Matcha is now permanently invited to live in my tea cabinet. It is a staple that I can't imagine living without now that I have tried it!

review/summary: Mmmmm Matcha!
review/text: In the tea base and flavoring itself, is that the green matcha really nicely stands out even more so than in some of the other flavors I have bought. You know, the more I drink this the more I am loving it for that very reason. You lose none of the blueberry flavor mixing it with a shake, latte, smoothie, whatever... and the green matcha base comes out even MORE! Its like some magical blueberry matcha gnomes came in while I was not looking and sprinkled some mojo on it! Mmmmmm. Such an interesting flavor, as I continue to drink I seem to pick up different subtle nuisances in this tea mixture. I mean I am used to that in non matcha teas, but I have to say this is the first matcha, let alone a flavored matcha I have tasted something slightly different each and every time! Sometimes its just really fresh and refreshING, other sips I get more sweet, some sips I am getting far more of the matcha base with that vegetal buttery sensation, other times I get peppery note even! Its strange, and enjoyable.

review/summary: better than some other Starbucks.....
review/text: I loved the Breakfast Blend (NOT the new Medium) before Starbucks dropped it completely.  I've been looking for a replacement, which is very hard to do, but heard that this Seattle's Best Level 3 was not bad.  I first tasted it at a local Subway, of all places, and it was incredibly good.  I ordered three from Amazon and continue to drink it, though it has yet to meet my preference for the old Breakfast Blend.  It does, however, if brewed a bit stronger than usual, have a very nice taste that I might just get used to.  It's not quite as sweet or smooth as the old B Blend, but it's fairly good overall.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: I ordered Seattle's Best Ground Blend Coffee, 12-Ounce (Pack of 2) and have brewed several pots with several changes in the amount of coffee used. I have yet to get a 'good' pot out of this. To be fair, what I expected from this was good flavor and strength. The coffee is weak, in my opinion. I also feel it lacks appealing flavor or flavor at all in some cases. I feel the taste is equal to making coffee from a bargain brand, which this is not. I would not re-order or recommend this coffee. Note that I love, however, the decaf version of this, which is very good- tasty and robust.

review/summary: Great wasabi flaovr not not pure wasabi
review/text: Wasabi can be a tricky thing to buy, as some sources coarse-gring the horseradish, and a lot comes as a paste.  This wasabi comes finely ground in a double sealed can to retain freshness.  It is easy to use in recipes and make into a paste, on an as-you-need basis, allowing you to always have wasabi on hand without the fear of it going bad or losing potency.  I would have given the wasabi 5-stars if it weren't for the fact that wasabi is actually the LAST ingredient in the product, with horseradish (i assume non-wasabi), mustard and tapioca starch preceeding wasabi on the list.  This would indicate that wasabi is actually less than 25% of the product content.  It does not affect the overall flavor but it is deceptive.
