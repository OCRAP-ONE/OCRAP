review/summary: misleading title
review/text: The title says Chicken with Rice and Vegetables, yet when I received the package, it was labeled Rice with Chicken and Vegetables.  The first one makes it sound like it has chicken as the main part of the meal, when it is actually rice.  That being said, they taste okay.  The chicken is fairly large chunks, and there's a mixture of veggies.  They taste a little bland, but they are okay to take for lunches.

review/summary: Much better than expected when I first saw it
review/text: When I first saw the size I was quite surprised because it looked like a snack for a 2 yr old.<br /><br />But actually because this has no water/soup in it - just actual rice, etc - it is more than expected looking at the size - I ended up ordering more of it.<br /><br />I like to mix it in to plain rice or with a can of condensed chicken and rice - it adds taste to these otherwise bland items. I like the taste which is better, more flavorful, than just plain rice and chicken soups - whether condensed or with water already added.<br /><br />Got hooked on it. Had to buy more.<br /><br />One odd thing is that this is the only microwavable bowl type that causes problems in the microwave - high pitch sound and even a flash. I put it into a microwave dish now. I tried it with 2 or 3 times and the same thing. But not with any other so far.

review/summary: Good Bargain Meal or Snack Staple
review/text: Perhaps, like me, you have been on diet plans that include prepackaged food items.  Sometimes I wonder if the primary goal of these diets is to deluge us with such foul and overpriced food that we will never want to eat again.  It's possible that this isn't the worst strategy, as people often lose weight on them, and I have found that my health is best when I follow them, both quantitatively and qualitatively.  However, while I may be forgiving of bad taste in the pursuit of a healthier me, I am not willing to throw all of my money into that black cauldron.<br /><br />So, as you may have guessed, I have decided to structure my own rigid meal plan using much less expensive store items.  Chef Boyardee is about as cheap as these canned soups get, and I set my expectations accordingly.  Upon first opening the can, I was pleased to find it stuffed tight with food.  This is quite good, as small cans of soup are sometimes filled with too much broth and not filling at all.  I find this is particularly true of "diet" soups, which simply lower the calories by increasing the amount of water.  As this soup is rice based, the primary concern is texture, and I was very pleased - not mushy and not crunchy.  The chicken and vegetables are in reasonable quantities for this price range and good quality.  I much prefer this to the discount soups stuffed with low quality chicken.<br /><br />Overall, I was very pleased with this soup, and would give it 5 stars given the price.  For a higher price, some competitors up the quality by including more chicken breast, but I find that they do little more in terms of creating a better flavor.

review/summary: As good as you'll get
review/text: The serving size, like all of these 7 ounce "bowls" is small. If you're an adult looking for a meal, this isn't it. It definitely works as a healthy snack or a meal substitute if you're dieting.<br /><br />The rice is mixed with chicken and veggies, and the whole thing tastes pretty darn good. It's not something you'd want to eat on a daily basis, but a couple times a week is fine.<br /><br />It heats up perfectly in one minute.<br /><br />Overall, not as well executed as the Ravioli, but not bad at all.

review/text: This Boyardee choice is a bit healthier than what you would get from ravioli or mac&cheese although not much. It is pretty tasty considering no refrigeration is needed and there are good sized chicken chunks in there along with a few veggies and the chicken fat. Make sure to heat it well so the fat can melt and spread otherwise you have a jelly.

review/summary: GREAT Baby/ TODDLER FOOD!!!!!! for my picky eater
review/text: I can't say enough goodness about this produc. The taste, texture is great for my toddler.  You do have to microwave it for a full minute then let it cool.  It sticks to itself so that your baby won't make a mess when they feed themselves, I do fish out the chunks of chicken.  Plenty of peas and carrots to put my mind at ease.  Pack some in the car, in the house, ready to go, it's the BEST for my picky little one. Especially nice since my kids don't like/eat tomato-based meals. DO NOT add water.

review/summary: Very delicious - hits that carb craving spot but not too badly
review/text: I have been buying the grass fed beef, the cagefree happy chicken eggs, the least pasteurized whole cream and watching my carbs in attempting to eat more healthfully. Then I discovered this Chef Boyardee Rice chicken & vegetables.  I may not eat perfectly all the time, but when the carb urge hits - plus me being asian - the rice in this entree is the perfect amount, and has the most delicious and satisfying taste! I had been buying Cambells chicken and rice soups but this Boyardee rice with chicken and vegies is more substantial.  To me, the mix of rice, vegies, and chicken is perfect and delicious.  I am so pleased that this product is available, and you can't fault its amazingly low price. Plus the container is so cute and it fits into your car trunk easily (for emergencies during the winter in Northern Virginia - when the snow is so bad and the traffic so bad that you can't go home for 13 hours while you are sitting in the car along with thousands of others stuck with you as in 2011's snow in DC) for you and to share with others - and also in your glove compartment and in your lunch tote!<br />I am so pleased this product is available!!!!

review/text: Such a disappointment! The first requirement of a lemon-flavored tea is that there be a lemon flavor. The reason for Richardson'e almost total failure to achieve this is seen in the ingredient list, which starts with dried honey. While there is a hint of lemon eventually, there is no comparison with Stash's Meyer Lemon tea - which uses Myer Lemon oil, as well as lemongrass, to assure that the advertised flavor is present. I'll be pitching the box.

Then, add 1 tsp of this paste into a warm glass of milk with black pepper sprinkled in. stir and drink. Watch how your asthma will improve rapidly! Drink twice per day, in morning and at night. Refrigerate the rest of the paste. The taste is ok. It stains so be careful not to spill the paste on anything. Also look into drinking raw milk and taking probiotics to help with your asthma or if you have eczema, which usually occur together. Not sure if turmeric supplements yield the same success..  but making a paste worked for my asthma, dramatically.

review/summary: Good brand, good size bags
review/text: When my husband first got our cat a few years ago, he started feeding her cheaper cat food.  She threw up one day all over the carpet, and it was really hard to get the "red" stains out from the color in the cat food.  He then switched her to Iams, and now on the rare occasion she has those problems, the carpet isn't stained like it was before.  Iams is a little more expensive than other brands, but it's definitely worth it.  Your cat doesn't cost that much money to keep anyway, so you might as well feed them better quality food.<br /><br />I defintely recommend buying this product from Amazon (the pack of 8 2-lb. bags).  You pay more up front, but it averages out to about the same, or maybe even a little less, as buying the 4 pound bags from the local stores.  Plus, your cat gets "fresher" food more often, which is especially good if you only have one cat and don't go through the bag as fast.  Yes, our cat is a little spoiled.

None are overweight and though the longhair gets frequent hairballs, that is not a result of the food, but rather how frequently I brush him. More brushing = less hairballs.

review/summary: GREAT DEAL, CONVENIENT
review/text: GREAT DEAL, CONVENIENT TOO.  Much cheaper than WalMart and I don't need to lug it home, it appears on my doorstep.  Cats hack up fewer hair balls and instead of adding petroleum products (ie-vaseline) like most HAIRBALL formulas, which causes diarrhea and blocks vitamin absorption, this one has probiotics, which make the digestive tract work better, thus eliminating most of the hairball problem in a healthy way.  (Nothing can prevent 100% of hairball hacking, it's just something all cats do once in awhile.)  A great deal on a great product, plus free shipping when you order over a certain amount.---Coos Bay Sandra

review/summary: Update: She got her first hairball
review/text: I have been feeding my cat all sorts of cat food.  She has long fur and hasn't had any hairballs.  If she gets hairballs on Iams Proactive hairball formula, I would definitely update this review.<br /><br />This food is different from any cat food I've ever bought because the kibble is shaped like tiny balls.  Up until now, my cat has eaten foods shaped like starfish or "Y" and "X."  She doesn't seem to mind the shape, though.<br /><br />My main beef with cat food is some of them smell so horribly bad (dead fish).  This one is fine.  That's what I buy for -- that and price.  If it does what it says, make my cat lose weight and controls hairballs, I will be a happy cat owner.<br /><br />Will come back in the future to update.<br /><br />____________________________<br /><br />UPDATE:  Well, this formula must not work.  After being on it for two months, my cat suffered her first hairball.

review/summary: Cat Had Bad Reaction
review/text: My sister has been feeding our cat Zoe this product for a few months now, recently she started to get a few cysts on her body, one on her face which caused the hair to fall out in that area. when we noticed this occurring we took her to the vet asap. The vet asked what type of food we feed her and my sister informed that we use Iams Weight Control (she has trouble loosing weight) The Vet told us that she has had a few animals come in lately with the SAME problem and EATING the same food!!!! we were told to stop feeding her Iams and use an all natural cat food with only half a cup of food in her bowl each day.. I DO NOT RECOMMEND! or your pet too can start getting cysts on their body.. no good

review/summary: Works for multi-cat families (Chicken Flavor)
review/text: If you have a multi-cat family and are struggling to find common ground to minimize digestion disturbances amongst all of them, this is a good bet.  My cats don't *love* this food, but they all tolerate it well and don't run away from it immediately after I pour it.<br /><br />Amazon's prices are unbeatable too, even for the small (2lb bags).  While it seems weird to get so many small bags, my cats appreciate it because the these bags don't reseal well, so with smaller bags, the food is fresher in general.<br /><br />As mentioned in the subject, this only applies to the Chicken flavor, my cats don't care for the others.

review/text: IAMS Original with Tuna Proactive Health Dry Cat Food has been a wonderful food for our 4 yr old female Manx.  Suddenly after years of good health & a beautiful coat we have to find something else she likes besides occasional raw fish or shrimp.  She will not eat IAMS salmon & brown rice, barely will touch the Chicken Proactive Health. I've finally backed down to Purina Tuna & Fish but I know it is not as healthy as IAMS. Why is the IAMS Tuna suddenly not available in HEBs, WalMarts, K-Mart, Feed Stores nor on-line?

review/summary: Delicious, Fresh...perfect!
review/text: I just tried a can of this C2O coconut water for the first time today and LOVE the flavor!  I bought it at the local chain natural market, despite being hesitant because other brands of coconut water have tasted weird and not much like the water from a fresh coconut at all.  Well, I liked it so much that I wanted to see if I could find it online.  I found it here, but it's too pricey.  At the market, I paid $1.79 + 10 cents CRV, so $1.89 for one can.  So I was sure I'd find it for a better deal here...not the case.  The sale price is $29 for a case of 12.  That's $2.42 per can.  Disappointing...Amazon is almost always the best deal or at least super close.  If Amazon can do better than $1.89 per can, I will definitely order because this C2O coconut water is awesome!!!

review/summary: The best packaged coconut water available
review/text: My wife and I have been heartily enjoying the delicious flavor and incredible health properties of coconut water for years now. When it was affordable to do so, we'd buy 10-20 raw young coconuts at a time and just drink the water straight from the husk. It was a magical time, but it became impractical to do that, unfortunately, and so we've searched for quite a while to find a suitable replacement. We've tried almost every brand of packaged coconut water available on the market. Most have been abysmally terrible, with extra sweetener added to mask the extra saltiness that is characteristic of the coastal locations most of those companies buy their coconuts from.<br /><br />This is not so with C20 coconut water. C20's water is absolutely incredible; it's amazingly light and super delicious. It's all natural too, with no extra sweetener added. It's simply young coconut water in all its glory. C20 use a special variety of young coconut unique to the groves they get their supply from, a variety with more sweetness and much less saltiness than the coastal coconuts most other brands get theirs' from. They also adhere to very specific and strict quality assurance processes to be certain that their product is always the highest quality available on the market. All of this clear devotion to the quality of their product as well as the quality of the water itself really sets C20 above all others out there. Exceptional stuff.<br /><br />My wife and I are raw foodists, and are conscientious of what processes most products go through before arriving on store shelves. I personally wrote to C20's customer service and asked about this, and they assured me that none of the nutrients, minerals, or enzymes are harmed in the process they are required by the FDA to go through before selling their products. This is a major selling point for us and hopefully that will help you health-conscious folks out there as well.<br /><br />Really, with the exception of going to the store and buying fresh young coconuts and draining them of their water straight from the husk, I'd argue there's no better way to experience coconut water than with C20. In fact, and I don't say this lightly, it may just match it. The only problem with this product is that oftentimes the price online will fluctuate between what's normal and what's unreasonable. If it's more than 24 dollars, then I recommend going to C20's website. From there, you can search for stores near you that sell their product, many of which offer discounts if you purchase entire 12-packs, which is nice. So whether you are a raw vegan who lives and swears by young coconut water, or an athlete who wants a very healthy drink that will replenish and revitalize you, or you're a regular person who just wants a delicious, natural, and healthy drink to enjoy, this is the best packaged coconut water on the market. Buy it, take in this incredibly refreshing and delicious water, and feel its awesome health benefits revitalize, replenish, and build-up your soul.<br /><br />*Update: 7/12/12*<br /><br />Just thought I'd mention that my wife and I have been buying about three cases of this coconut water a week for the past 7 months or so. We have a standing order of three cases just for us every week at our local grocery store, we get a special 10% "case" discount, and the local store we get them from seems to have had a perpetual sale that keeps the price at $1.79 per can instead of $2.20. When combined with the case discount, that's less than $20 a case (even less if you recycle the cans and get some cash back that way! :D). Sometimes the sale price is even lower. Great deal, but that's not the reason I posted this update. After 7 months of buying 3 cases every week, I still have not found a single unsatisfactory can of coconut water in that whole time. I'm not exaggerating and I'm not making this up. There genuinely isn't a single sip of C20 coconut water that I didn't love, and we've literally gone through hundreds of cans. If there ever were to be a bad can, I'd definitely remember it in contrast of the perpetual "awesome" streak we've had with this brand. The longer I drink it, the more I am astounded at this company's quality. Hope this helped solidify your confidence in this coconut water and that you'll be enjoying it yourself soon. Thanks for reading my review. Have a good day, Toodles. :D

review/summary: My new favorite packaged coconut water!
review/text: I just received a case of this stuff with some degree of anticipation, as the website for this product did an effective job of selling me on it.<br /><br />One of the interesting claims the site made about this was that the coconut trees were grown on or near fresh water, instead of salt, and that this would make a difference in how the coconut water tastes.<br /><br />Well, after looking at the can and seeing that these are from Thai coconuts, I figured this would taste a lot like Amy & Brians coconut water, and it does!<br /><br />Based on the one can I've consumed so far, I would say that it's a touch sweeter than the aforementioned coconut water, and maybe just a tad bit fresher tasting.  Otherwise, they are hard to tell apart.  Even the cans are pretty close to identical.<br /><br />All in all, I'd be happy with either brand, but given a choice, I'd lean towards the C2O.

review/summary: best coconut water
review/text: I taste tested this with vita coco and c2o came out superior with a blind test.  vita coco leaves a sour aftertaste while c2o is somehow just sweet enough to drink without feeling like crap.  I purchased 3 cases already and i tried it at first because joe rogan said its effing delicious. i drank up to 3 a day.  I'm about to order another case but i guess they recently changed the price.  before it was $24 with free shipping, now theres no free shipping and price increased to $29.  so with shipping its about $38 for 12.  unfortunately i am not rich enough to afford this so until the price gets realistic (cmon $3 a can) then i wont purchase any.  what a shame, this is the reason for my 3 stars, if it was more affordable then it would be 5

review/summary: IMO Best Coconut Water on the market
review/text: I visited a friend and she had me try C2O Coconut water.  I loved it, great in the morning or anytime.  A nice refreshing taste and it felt so good doing down, like I was doing something good for my body.  That was an unexpected bonus.<br /><br />Because of the price, I decided to taste test all of the coconut waters so I bought a few of each brand - Zico, A&B w/pulp, Vita Coconut, O.N.E to compare.  C2O just was the most refreshing and full flavored, tasted like the real thing.<br /><br />All of the brands I bought say they're just natural coconut water, but there is definitely a taste difference.  One has an after taste, another seemed watered down or flat, but C2O was consistantly good.<br /><br />The main problem is price.  I bought a case of C2O from Amazon last week, think it was $29. and free shipping.  I didnt realize it was on "Sale".  This week Amazon has it for $43.  Give me a break, that price difference is ridiculous.<br /><br />Amazon needs to work on their pricing for this product or else I'm going else where to buy.  Heard even Hi-Health had it for much cheaper than Amazon....<br /><br />Also, in reading some of the coconut water reviews, I started laughing at the "dented" cans.  Every one of the cans in my 12 case was dented when I received my shipment.  I thought it was odd at the time, but then saw this happened to others.  What's with that?

review/text: I grow up in Thailand and coconut water has been my favorite drinks. After moving to US, it's hard for me to find a good coconut water. I tried other brands that shipped from Asia before and hate it because those are all sugar added. After finding this in the local market, I was skeptical at first.. but wow! they did a great job packing the true flavor into this can. I'm immediately hooked. I'm also drinking Zico for my hot yoga since they have more mineral.. but the flavor of C20 is far better.

review/text: I really wanted to find a good coconut water after trying various kinds I didn't care for. I've tried those with added flavors and with the chunks of coconut included and I just didn't really like any of them. But I really love coconut, so I wanted to keep trying to find one I like. And this coconut water is just plain delicious. It has a great flavor and it is nicely sweet. It's not overwhelming or bland. Definitely the best thing to cracking open a young coconut and drinking it fresh, which I have done before.<br /><br />Although purchasing it on Amazon is about the same price as buying it a can at a time at my grocery store otherwise I'd consider getting a case. But I definitely recommend trying it. It's very refreshing and basically perfect coconut water.

review/text: This coconut water tasted better than another brand I was buying a few years ago. We couldn't get it locally and were very glad to find it on Amazon. I promise, it doesn't need added sweetener. Delicious as is.

review/summary: Excellent Coconut water
review/text: I have tried all brands and say this is one of the top ones. It has a very natural flavor and so far very consistent.  Not to sweet and not too bland. What I have noticed is that the local stores have this same product anywhere from 1.50-1.79 a can.  Amazon is way over priced for this item. With the buying power of Amazon, I'm sure they get this product for 1.25 a can so I'm buying local unless there is a price drop.

review/summary: Finally, SOMEONE GOT IT RIGHT!
review/text: I've tried EVERY BRAND of coconut water on Amazon and in stores that I could find. I've had fresh coconut water from all over... Brazil, Thailand, you name it. Just got back from a trip to Vietnam/Thailand in fact. Love coconut water.<br /><br />This is BY FAR the best brand on Amazon in my opinion. Not all coconuts are created equal, nor are the different packaged varieties.<br /><br />I think the closest any other brands came to this were VitaCoco and Amy&Brian brands, but they are not quite at the quality of C2O.<br /><br />Everything else is pretty much junk as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Just for the sake of saving others time, I'll throw out the WORST brand: Naked. Don't EVER buy Naked brand coconut water. It's an abomination.<br /><br />Oh, there was one more brand I can't remember - I got it from a local Chinese grocery and you can't even find the brand name on Google. It was also at the quality of C2O, but I really need a brand I can buy in bulk online so this is it for me!

review/summary: Really top notch tasting, natural sweetness and just great
review/text: really delicious, much sweeter in taste (though no added sugar) than Vita Coco and O.N.E., the only other brands of coconut water I've tried to date.  Though the shipping problems and relative cost of the better selling tetrapacks may mean I end up getting those again instead of this.<br /><br />The nutritional label does indicate about 40% less nutrients across the board than the more popular, and cheaper brands though.  The company says the sweeter taste is due to the use of inland coconuts so it's fresh water not salt water, and perhaps that has something to do with it, or it's just a different variety, or maybe the label's wrong.  Regardless, the taste is just really out of this world good.  The cans are industrial strength sturdy and heavy, which is good because Amazon made sure every single one of the twelve was dented upon arrival.  Impressive considering the cardboard box and plastic wrap around the 12-pack itself seemed intact, yet the sides of the cans, all of them, were dented, even the ones surrounded by other cans that were actually fine on the top and the bottom.  A few airpack bags thrown in on one of six sides of the 12 pack, and nothing else, as I've come to expect from Amazon shipped items.  Even if you bought a few things at once to try to get them to use a larger box, it wouldn't matter.  Can't even count on items shipping from same warehouse, so that doesn't work.<br /><br />Amazon really needs to make changes to ensure safe shipping on these, with use of different packing material or additional padding so that they arrive intact.  Since I think it's a new product, I wasn't concerned with them having sat around in damaged cans for long, and the company even has some superdoop expensive nonreactive can liner or so they say, so I just drank em down anyway.  I really can't do the taste justice, it would sound preachy and inadequate if I did.  Highly recommend.  Horrible Amazon shipping care though with a casual disregard for the contents.  It's a shame to order gourmet coconut water that costs twice what decent beer would and have it arrive all dented.

review/summary: The best coconut water around
review/text: Trust me, coconut water tastes different, not all the coconut waters tastes the same.<br /><br />I am from India and we have a coconut tree in our front porch - have been drinking coconut water almost every since I was born !  While there is a wide variation of the taste of coconut water within India, I had a shock when I tasted coconut water in Singapore - it was something out of the world, it was much sweeter than what we get in india and had a unique flavor to it.  Eversince then I wanted to find out what variety do they cultivate in Singapore/Thailand and wanted to get them to India and introduce them to local farmers - which I have never been able to do, but hopefully will do it one day !!<br /><br />In the US - Coconut water is pretty expensive and buy them once in a way - tried Zicco, C2O and a couple of other brands.<br /><br />My conclusion is that C2O coconut water is really the best in terms of taste and Zicco is the worst.  The only good thing about Zicco is the packaging !

review/summary: Gatoradeeee.... C2o!
review/text: Ambrosia. I first learned this ethereal term in high school when reading Greek fiction. It is the term used to describe the drink of the gods, but the description stops there. Often I wondered what It might taste like for it to be so popular amongst deities. Does it just taste great? Is that all a god is looking for in their beverage? Or is it invigorating? I supposed it would have to be, after all, reigning over the realm of mortals and hurling thunderbolts must wear a guy/gal out. Would it need to be healthy and nourishing?The gods ARE Immortal, but that doesn't mean they can't get sick of overweight, just look at Dionysus for instance.<br /><br />I would ponder the potential attributes of such a drink for days, wonder what powerful, maybe magical, properties it would need to have to satisfy such a lofty audience. Then, one day long after I had given up my quest, I got my answer.<br /><br />As I was perusing the vast inventory of our local whole foods grocery store, I stumped upon something called C2o, the very product I am reviewing today. My thought process was "I love coconut, why not coconut water" after all that reasoning had served me fairly well with other such substances (Lemonade, apple juice, ect....). My first taste was absolute shock, the drink was cold and smooth, it had a viscosity to it slightly greater than water, and a flavor that was mild yet distinct. Then the can was empty. I was distraught, so I turned back to the store to purchase another. The beverage has a subtle sweetness about it which is pleasant and not at all overpowering. It is as refreshing as a cold glass of water but with all the benefits of an one of those highly touted sports drinks. I was in hydration heaven...<br /><br />As I let the second can rattle to the floor, feeling a bit like a alcoholic, I realized I finally had my answer. THIS was ambrosia, this was what I had been trying to describe all those years ago. I needed more, but at 3.00$ a can I was looking at taking quite a hit in my wallet to feed this new addiction. So I turned to amazon and got a affordable solution. The cans were pretty banged up upon delivery but the C2o tasted none the worse for it. I plan on buying much more of this product as the year goes on.

review/summary: Very refreshing, loved it.
review/text: I really enjoyed this a lot.  It took no time to develop a taste for it, rather it was good from the first sip of the first can.  I haven't tried many coconut waters, I have tried one other kind called Vita Coco which I was able to buy at Wal-Mart.  That tasted like dishwater and I really couldn't finish it.  This was the second kind I tried, and if C2O is the best available on the market, then I'm ok with that because it is excellent without being overpowering.  Only problem here is that amazon is really the only place I can buy this C2O due to location, but the price is outrageous now.  I first bought it for $23.99 with free shipping due to being a prime member, the very next week I look into buying more and the price was $29.00 plus $13.00 shipping which is unacceptable for me.  I will try some others now, and hopefully amazon can start keeping this in stock and quit outsourcing it to outside sellers.

review/summary: Thai coconuts are the best!
review/text: First off, I 100% prefer Thai coconut water to the Brazilian varieties and I have tried every brand out there.  So, if you've never tried the Thai coconut water, I would encourage you to go out to the local grocery and buy a can. 17.5 oz cans of the Thai varieties average about two bucks in my local grocery. C2o tastes like the fraternal twin of Amy & Brian Natural Coconut Juice Pulp Free, 17.5 Ounce Tins (Pack of 12).  They are way less acidic (to me Brazilian coconut water has a prickly bite like pineapple) and sweeter tasting that the Brazilian coconut waters.  Those who watch carbs will note that C2o has 26 per 17.5 oz can and A&B has 32 carbs.  This is a more than the Brazilian ones, but I think the taste is worth it.  I usually only drink them if I feel dehydrated, while working out, or when I feel exhausted and need energy.  I sometimes work four 12-hour night shifts in a row and sleep away my next day off and wake up feeling dead tired and bone dry and the first thing I reach for is coconut water.  I've been buying  from the local Kroger for years, but they always only have four or so cans at a time and they are usually VERY dented.  I've ordered A&B online and they still come dented.  So do these C2o cans, though not as badly as the A&B. I usually don't buy dented cans, but these haven't killed me yet.

Hopefully the nutritional quality is there, and in that case, I'd be content.

Im guessing its the way they need to heat the coconut water in order to fill it in cans.<br />I gave it two stars because it does taste like coconut albeit a very sweet version. For the same price, I prefer a tetra pak brand like vita coco which has less sweet taste + nutritional components like potassium, magnesium.

review/summary: Great to satisfy your sweet tooth
review/text: My family has been working to eliminate corn syrup entirely from our diets.  While the surf sweets brand has helped with our gummy cravings, we were struggling to find a corn syrup free hard candy that was not a lollipop or too large (i.e. something small to suck on that wouldn't contribute too many calories or sugar to our diet).<br /><br />These have been a dream come true - the flavors are all vibrant and complex, the size is perfect (it has the circumference similar to a dime, and is as thick as five or six dimes stacked on top of each other), and the calorie count is not that bad (around 15 calories per drop).  They are also organic, nut free, and GMO free on top of not having corn syrup, which is an added bonus.  My only complaint is all the plastic involved - each candy is individually wrapped is a swath of clear plastic, which seems slightly wasteful (we are trying to be more conscious of a waste output and plastic usage).  I hope that in the future they find a more environmentally friendly way of presenting the sweets, but for now this is still the best corn syrup free candy I've found out there!

review/summary: Good Sampler of  All-Natural Fruit Hard Candies that Taste Like Real Fruit.
review/text: YummyEarth is probably the best-known brand of all-natural lollipops and hard candies in the US. They don't have a lot of competition, as I found out in my search for naturally-flavored candies. But they do offer a lot of flavors. YummyEarth offers 19 flavors of hard candies, 12 of which are fruit. I was looking for fruit, so I bought this "family size" (13 oz) "Freshest Fruit" assortment of Organic Candy Drops. It contains approximately 115 hard candies in 8 fruit flavors: watermelon, blueberry, apple, pomegranate, mango, blood orange, strawberry, and cherry. The candies are vegan, gluten-free, all-natural, and certified organic. They are sweetened with organic evaporated sugar cane juice (also known as Sucanat or Florida Crystals), organic tapioca syrup and/or organic rice syrup. Five candies (one serving) contain 70 calories and 17g carbohydrates.<br /><br />The first trick is to figure out which color is which flavor. It doesn't say on the bag, so here's a key:<br /><br />Wet-Face Watermelon: pink<br />Too Berry Blueberry: white/red<br />Sour Apple Tart: chartreuse<br />Pomegranate Pucker: dark red (white writing on wrapper)<br />Mango Tango: yellow/gold<br />Blood Orange Cocktail: red/gold<br />Strawberry Smash: red/pink<br />Very Very Cherry: dark red (blue writing on wrapper)<br /><br />As expected, the natural flavors are a lot better than artificial fruit flavors. Nothing could be worse than artificial strawberry flavor. YummyEarth's strawberry is a little more tart than a real strawberry. Watermelon also tastes of watermelon at first, but there is a second burst that is tart. They still taste good, but there is some room for improvement, as those are both naturally sweet flavors. I was surprised by the blueberry, because I don't like blueberries, but I like this candy. The blood orange and mango tasted to me the most like the fresh fruit. I was especially impressed by the blood orange candies. I expected them to taste like generic orange, but they really taste like blood orange. Mango is very fruity as well. Most of YummyEarth's fruit flavors are available only in big single bags, but this is a good sampler. Something for everyone. I only wish they made a citrus assortment.

review/summary: Approach freshest fruit in yummy's way
review/text: Hmm... Actually I was really satisfied by the flavors it provided. There are about 115 or so candy drops per bag, and the shape is medium so that it can last for a long time. The only pitiful thing was that all 8 flavors were not distributed properly, therefore most of the time I'm enjoying the limited kinds of sweetness instead of all... About the shipping rate, it's bearable (although slower than normal free 2-days shipping, as I was a prime member). Package is good. If you wanna give your life some hue in a healthy way, try it. Remember don't eat too much for one time, not because the freshness would plump out from your month, but because it was too natural (sour?) to make your tongue paralytic... Anyway I was addicted to it and undoubtedly would come bk and buy more. lol
