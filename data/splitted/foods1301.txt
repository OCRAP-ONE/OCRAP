review/summary: Great Energy, Great Product!
review/text: A friend of mine gave me some PepPod to try and I loved it! All you do is drop it in a glass or bottle of water. It tastes great, much better than most canned energy drinks. The energy is quite noticeable, it made me very alert and energized for hours. And i didn't crash like i do with most energy drinks - probably because they don't use any sugar in PepPod. I'm now a huge fan of PepPod, I take it with me everywhere i go. Its easy to use and much healthier than all other energy drinks. The packaging and design is really cool too! I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Great Energy Drink
review/text: This is a great product if you need a pick me up.  I bought it for post-skiing and post hot tub, when I start to fade!  I love the ability to carry it with me in my pocket or my purse.  I didn't have any side effects and the product seems to have a good combination of B vitamins.  I almost didn't purchase this product because of the one bad review that was posted.  I didn't experience anything that he posted with the nausea or jitters-- thought it was a much milder and healthier option than 5 hour energy and will definitely purchase again.

review/summary: Great product without all the sugar
review/text: We used the product and are very pleased with the results, it does not give you a artificial burst of energy but does give you the lift one is looking for without all the sugar highs. It gives one a feeling of well being as well as the extra energy one needs and looking for. It,s about time someone offered a product which I feel is giving the whole body a natural type of energy.

review/summary: Some like it HOT!!!!
review/text: I have been drinking PepPod for a while now, and I LOVE IT!  I keep the pods in a canister on my kitchen counter and every morning I make a cup of HotPod tea.  A few minutes later I am awake and alert with a feeling of well being to start my day!  I can't drink coffee because it gives me the jitters, but with PepPod I'm just up and away.  My son is in high school and he loves it too.  He drinks it every morning before school, and carries it in his backpack (since it's so small and light).  So glad he is off the Coke and Pepsi and is drinking something good for his body and his brain.  Sometimes I wonder if he's not trading it at lunch with his friends.<br /><br />Thank you PepPod people, for a wonderful mother's little helper.  I'm doing something good for me and my kids.  My hair is getting thicker and growing faster too.  B vitamins maybe??

review/summary: 2 Thumbs Down!!
review/text: I buy products online based solely on reviews of different products. I figured if the majority approve of it should be just fine. About 98% of the time, this is the case for me however, with PepPod this is NOT the case.<br /><br />PepPod comes in a tablet form and dissolves in your cup of water. The directions on the packaging give you an option to tailor your flavor from strong to strongest. Strong is 16oz of water, Stronger is 8oz and Strongest is 8oz of water. None of this is listed on the online description. According to the reviews and the product description PepPod is not like any other energy drink. You get a burst of energy naturally; no jitters, jittery feeling, racing heartbeats, and a crash after it wear off. It also has 81mg of caffeine and says on the packaging that if you are "sensitive" to caffeine maybe you should consult with your physician.<br /><br />I made sure to try it when I was tired. I was on my way to my part-time job after already working an 8-hour day and took mine in 10oz to be on the safe side. I was so excited because I have been trying to find something like PepPod. About 30 mins after drinking my PepPod I started feeling sick, nausea, jittery feelings and even more tired than I did before I drink it. I am NOT a caffeine drinker. I do not drink coffee or soda but I wouldn't consider myself sensitive to Caffeine as I have in the past but maybe I am now because I do not drink it now and haven't in years. What I do know is this product made me sick, it was ineffective, and everything it claimed to do it did NOT! To the caffeine drinkers maybe the 81 MG and the other ingredients will not affect you. To the non-caffeine drinkers this will certainly affect you and 81 mg of caffeine is equivalent to a cup of coffee. I will NOT recommend this product to anyone I will be returning it.

review/summary: Ghirardelli Chocolate Brownie Mix, Ultimate Fudge
review/text: Searching for a moist, true fudge brownie?  Look no further!  My own personal quest in the search for the ultimate brownie brought me to countless recipes on the internet which I tried, then promptly threw away.  Nothing worse than having a dry cake brownie when you want a decadent, deep rich, moist fudge brownie!  Having spied the Ghirardelli brownie box in the grocery store, I thought why not?  After all Ghirardelli does make chocolate.  By the way, the box says ultimate fudge and for good reason, it's a true statement!  These are so sinful, so delicious that I will never be trying another recipe for homemade.  Forget that when Ghirardelli makes it so easy.  The packet of fudge topping makes it all the more better.  Honestly if you desire a rich, sinful moist fudge brownie, this is it.  Hands down it's the winner and I would rate it at 10 stars if I could.

review/summary: most DELICIOUS BROWNIE MIX I've had in recent memory
review/text: I'm not much of a dessert person (I prefer savory foods to sweets), and especially not a super chocolate fan... but oh my, these brownies were AMAZING.  I admit, trying just the frosting at first turned me off, but upon trying the brownies themselves, omg, I was impressed.  They are pretty sweet, so I think I'd like it better if it had walnuts (will add some next time!), but still not overbearingly sweet for my tastes.<br /><br />I agree with the previous positive reviews, the texture is especially what makes these brownies so special.  VERY moist, chewy, and thick!!<br /><br />A++++ would eat again.

review/summary: Great for Chocolate lovers, can't mess these up!
review/text: I have had a long standing battle with brownie mixes. I could never get them to turn out like the brownies my neighbors made. Mine were always hard on the edges, or too runny in the middle. I wanted to find a mix that made the death by chocolate type homemade brownie but it a quick mix. This is the one. It is easy to use and I have never had a bad batch. They are so moist and they rarley last a few hours in my house. The kids all love them. Whenever I have a chocolate craving I make these. They are very rich tatsting. I use half the oil recommended and put in 1 tablespoon of softened butter. In closing I would say I usually am a bargain shopper and I could get brownie mixes free with coupons at my local grocery but this mix is a are exception in my shopping style, they are so good it is one item I will I pay the full price for.

review/summary: Short on brownie mix but otherwise good
review/text: Disappointing lack of chocolate taste for something from Ghiradelli. Odd taste and low overall volume. Edible, but I add a tablespoon of cocoa powder to the batter, because without it the overall taste is more 'burnt sugar' than chocolate, even the frosting. It's odd, more caramel than chocolate flavor. Whatever the reason, the taste is more burnt caramel than chocolate. I also think the amount of dough is 1/2 what it should be, they skimp on the volume. One could double up on boxes in an 8x8" pan.

review/summary: Too bad You can't compost these
review/text: I bought these on impulse on a sweep through Wally's, and I have to say I think they're only slightly better than some of the microwave mixes I've tried. Texture is awful, and the taste leaves me wanting that chocolately kick that good brownies have. They seem more like a cake, and not a good one at that, and we used the recipe for thicker brownies. The "fudge" topping is also boring. We ate them with Breyers Extra Creamy Vanilla Ice Cream which tastes like frozen marshmallow cream. Gross! We choked down one serving, and the rest went in the trash...brownies and ice cream.<br />Do yourself a favor and get these:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025VQIYY">Duncan Hines Brownie Mix, Double Fudge, 17.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br />Then top them with some Prairie Farms Premium Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. Duncan Hines has it right. Ghirardelli should stick to bar chocolate. And they call these Ultimate?

I tried to take the easy way out instead of making my own. Big mistake! Glad I wasn't serving these to company. So much for "premium" brownie mix.

review/summary: Very fragrant, low price
review/text: After scouring the web, this offering from Amazon was about the cheapest for one pound of cardamom powder shipped from a trustworthy source. Very fragrant even before I cut open the packet fully. It comes in a sealed plastic bag covered all over by silver lining. Storing it in the freezer.<br /><br />I bought this large a quantity because I add a few pinches of a spice mix that includes this powder for making indian milk tea. The spice mix contains this powder along with ginger, cinnamon, and clover powders in 3:3:1:0.5 proportion. To make indian milk tea use a 1:1 proportion for water:2% milk (for 1 cup of tea, add 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup milk). Add this mix to water prior to boiling then just when it begins to boil add 1 teaspoon (mounted) black tea power and bring it to a boil for 1 minute. Pre-heat the milk in the microwave and then add to the boiled tea liquid. Mix well and filter the entire mixture using a tea filter. Add sugar if desired. I make tea about 3-4 times a day for 2 or more people, a 1 lb caradamom usually lasts a year to make my spice mix.

But Herdez salsa is quite delicious. It never disappoints. It has a nice texture, like some crazy person actually decided to make it with chopped tomatoes and peppers.

If you want a delicious jarred salsa that doesn't disappoint, try Herdez. Or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017I1QB6">Arriba! Fire Roasted Mexican Red Salsa, Medium, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a>, which is my absolutely favorite jarred salsa of all time, except when I can find it it costs like ten bucks a jar and I don't love chips and salsa THAT much.

review/summary: Safe ingredients and pretty tasty!
review/text: I bought this a couple weeks ago while I was on vacation and craving hot chocolate.  I found it in a local natural foods store and it cost $8 for the 12 oz. package.<br /><br />My husband is allergic to MSG so we read ingredient lists and before this I've never found a hot cocoa mix he can drink, so we always make it from scratch.  I don't feel comfortable consuming a lot of the stuff contained in normal hot cocoa mixes.  The ingredient lists are SO long and full of a lot of bad stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, we found this Equal Exchange hot cocoa and I've been having it a lot lately.  At the store they had a spicy version and a regular version, and of course this review is for the regular version.<br /><br />The first time I had this hot cocoa I didn't really think it was all that great.  It isn't nearly as sweet as most commercial hot cocoas are.  I made it with water, and there wasn't as much flavor as I was expecting.  I think I was probably diluting it without realizing it.  Oops!<br /><br />Now, I use less water and more cocoa mix and I like it a lot.  It is a darker hot chocolate, more like something you would get at Starbucks, and less like one of the Nestle mixes.  I haven't made it with milk yet, but I suspect it would taste even better that way.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm not really into fair trade stuff all the time, but I DO like that this is organic, and I was really excited to find a hot cocoa mix with a "safe" ingredient list.  I will probably look for this at my local natural food stores and see if I can find it here; I would definitely buy it again.<br /><br />Ingredient list: organic evaporated sugar cane juice, organic nonfat dry milk powder, organic cocoa powder - processed with alkali, organic guar gum, sea salt, organic carob bean gum, organic vanilla powder (organic vanilla extract, organic maltodextrin and organic gum arabic).<br /><br />By weight it is 73% fair trade content. Kosher. Contains milk. Manufactured on equipment that processes products containing soy, wheat, and eggs.

It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff. Now, my dog spits out the all-natural kibble -which I assume he thinks tastes like cardboard after having his taste buds desensitized by all the salt. Kinda like a Pandora's box.<br /><br />The stool is softened soft serve ice cream consistency.

review/summary: Not worth buying on Amazon!!!!!!!!
review/text: Everytime I get this shipment delivered, the cans are broken and the food leaked out and there are bugs everywhere. I have to throw away part of the the shipment and go through the disgust and hassle of cleaning it up. This is the third shipment we received like this (I had one shipment damaged and had the shipments on automatic renew each month and the last shipments were damaged too) and I am fed up. I posted a comment to the seller about this after the frst shipment and never received a response and the problem keeps happening. SO NOT WORTH IT and I AM VERY UNHAPPY!!!! I am going to the local Walmart to get it there is not much of a difference in price and at least I know I am not getting bugs shipped to my home and having to throw out cans that are damaged. I cancelled my future shipments and DO NOT recommend anyone order this product from Amazon.

review/summary: Dog Food by the Case
review/text: I never knew you could by dog food at Amazon until one day I just happened to bounce upon it.  To my amazement it came right when it was promised and no shipping to top that off was a delight.  My dog is happy too because she never has to wait for her meal like in some days she did when I would run out and have to go to the store.  This just adds a nice portability to fresh dog food and I do mean it came fresh. I have bought this same brand at the store before and it was not fresh plus I paidd a higher price per can.  Boy that was disappointing.  But now I will always order her food this way.  I hope to add the cats food next time.

review/text: The first ingredient isn't even a specific type of meat. It's meat broth. You have NO IDEA what it is. The first ingredient should always be a specific kind of meat, like Chicken. The second ingredient is Meat By-Product. That is the part of a meat, yet again not specified like it should be, that is not approved for human consumption. Like the beaks and legs of a chicken. Unhealthy! ALWAYS LOOK AT THE LABELS.

review/summary: Tempted my 14 year 8 mo old dog to eat!
review/text: I tried some of this on my old guy, an American Staffordshire Terrier that is 14 years, 8 months old. He had just gone through a phase of refusing to eat his normal food, which is good stuff, but is a dry kibble mini disc type ( Bench & Field Holistic - Very good food! )<br />So I got some canned foods to try on him.  Got the Newman's, and 2 other organic kinds.  Buster just loves the canned foods, but the consistency of some of the others is sloppier and harder for him to eat, as they just seem to mash into the bowl, and he has to lick them instead of being able to eat them in soft chunks.  This food smells almost good enough to make me hungry...... and is easy to spoon into his dish, where it takes him less than a nano-second to select a nice chunk and eat it.  I just stand there, and spoon a few chunks at a time into his bowl and he looks for more.<br />So I am really happy with this food and even if he DOES get spoiled on it, he's so worth spoiling at his advanced age that I don't consider it a problem!<br />Before this, I was cooking human food to tempt him just to eat, so this is better balanced and seems to give him more energy.<br />( Before this, he was feed on free schedule, with a bowl of dry food out at all times, and he would eat every 3 days when he felt like it. That worked very well for 14 plus years!  I did the same with my first AmStaff, and he made it to 15. ) Also, Buster has NEVER had to make a vet visit for illness or medical problem his entire life until 2 weeks ago, so that eating arrangement obviously worked great for a very long time!  ; )

review/summary: HONEST REVIEW!
review/text: I live in Manhattan and i have a beagle (5yr old) n i ordered this food because the economy is bad and i need cheap afforable dog food. People talk about this food as if its garbage so i did my research by a co worker who used to work for pedigree and online. The food is proccess is nasty! but if has all the vitamins and protien needed for all dogs. I checked cans at a pet store and pediagree had more vitamins and more crude protien then science diet n others. I know the food is made bad but it isnt effecting your dog. I recieved the cans unharmed just 1 was a lil bent but it wasnt a biggy n i recieved it fairly quick and my dog loves the food. I recommend this food for low income pet owners.  N pedigree may be bad but feeding your dog people food is even worse. Think about that!. Also Pedigree was the #1 dog food back in the 80S n 90s but since all these new dog food came out and research was done on the food was declared garbage. It still used in shelters.

review/summary: Delicious Meaty Dog Food
review/text: Pedigree  smells delicious.  It is an enticing smell, good enough to make humans turn their noses toward it.  A black lab and a standard poodle in our family agree that it tastes delicious.  The meaty chunks of real beef  in a doggy-tasty gravy pleases the most finicky canines. None of the humans in the family have tried it though.<br /><br />It has all the meat in it that a dog needs for maintenance, and it can be mixed with dry food for extra crunch.  There is the right balance of calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth and bones, according to the Pedigree people.  It also has omega fatty acids and the essential nutrient for healthy skin and a shiny coat.  The dogs find it highly digestible so that the nutrients are easily absorbed.  (All these features are listed on the Pedigree web page.)<br /><br />Highly recommended!

I eventually used 4 tsp in a sugar cookie recipe and STILL could not discern any flavor hazelnut or otherwise! I tried it in a simple sugar and milk glaze thinking perhaps cooking had influenced the flavor. There was only the slightest vaguely bitter taste to the glaze. There was no flavor, pleasant or otherwise in anything I tried this product in.

review/summary: GF breading couldnt be easier... couldnt be better
review/text: Having been diagnosed with Ciliac, like everyone who is on a GF (Gluten Free) diet, there are many foods that are no longer an option. I've adjusted fairly well, but didn't realize how much I missed breaded foods until I used these Corn Flake Crumbs. It may sound silly, but I was thrilled when I had breaded chicken... It was delicious and the texture was just right! I've since used these crumbs on fish, shrimp, even jalapeno poppers! They're outstanding!<br /><br />They come in cans which make use and storage very easy. When I originally ordered, I was concerned about getting 6-cans on my first order... From that very first use, I'm glad I got all 6-cans!<br /><br />If you are on a GF diet or if you cook for someone who is... There isn't anything better out there.

They were horrible, I could tell from the way they looked(it looks like Corn Meal, not corn flakes)they were going to be bad, but since I spent so much on them I had to try. They wouldn't stick to the pork chop, they wouldn't brown, and when I put in the toaster oven to keep warm, it made the pork chop all soggy. No flavor at all.<br />Disgusting..don't waste your $$ on this!

review/text: I don't know what I would have done without these gluten-free corn flake crumbs. I use it as breading for my different fish and chicken. Being gluten intolerant limits choices for breading that tastes normal. Regular cornflakes are a no-no because of the malt flavoring. Order from Amazon.com and opt for the subscribe and save method and have it delivered to your door. Living in rural New Mexico limits accessibility to many of the foods I need. Amazon.com is the perfect answer for me. You won't be disappointed -- just remember to season the crumbs good before dipping.

They shipped far sooner then they predicted the cost for S/H on 3 bottles was still the same price as it was for 1 so I ordered 3, I am going to make a wedding cake for my daughter and with the leftovers I am going to make ice shave and juice drinks. Thanks for a great transaction and product.

review/summary: try with vodka and diet 7-up
review/text: I have tried several brands of unsweetened passion fruit concentrate besides this one, and they all are from Brazil and basically the same.<br /><br />I have bought this exact product several times from Andre's Cuban Market in San Diego. They adjust the price quite often but it is usually around $5 a bottle. It is concentrated and unsweetened, allowing me to use a small amount of natural or artificial sweetener to get my desired taste. Most other products claiming to have passion fruit have a very small amount, under 20%, and so much sugar is mixed in that the flavor is ruined.<br /><br />This is a great substitute product for me when passion fruit is out of season, or for making marinades, cocktails, and flavored soft drinks any time of year.<br /><br />I have tried mixing with various soft drinks and determined mixing one part of this to 3 parts diet 7-up is the best. The result is still quite sour, if you want something sweeter use more 7-up.<br /><br />I consider the 4.39 price listed here a very good value given the level of concentration and the long life it has in the refrigerator due to its strong acidity.

review/text: I have been looking for a genuine source of true maracuja flavor to make juice and to make an Indian drink called a lassi.  I was so thrilled to find this product and the lassi was incredible.  I first encountered passion fruit flavor when I was in brazil.  An old woman placed a real passion fruit in a blender and then added water and sugar after straining the seeds.  After 27 years I have never forgotten the intense and tart flavor.  What a thrill to experience it again.

review/summary: Tastes Great!
review/text: Since visiting Hawaii, I have fallen in love with Passion Fruit Juice.  This flavor is hard to find, even in California.  Often other tropical flavors are mixed in.<br /><br />This tastes exactly like I expected it too.  It is very concentrated.  I am happy with about an ounce in a 20 ounce bottle.  I add water, ice and Splenda to taste.  The directions say to mix the 16.9 ounce bottle with 8 more bottles of water = makes over a gallon.  As far as I can tell, it is unsweetened.  It does contain some preservatives including cirtic acid, sodium bezoate and metabisulphite.  This comes from Brazil.<br /><br />Great product!! I use it for juice, to flavor Greek yogurt, and to add to a white or yellow cake for a tropical flavor.  You can also make a great pie.  Follow your favorite lemon chiffon recipe, and use this instead of the lemon juice.  I will be buying more.  I bought 4 bottles = same shipping cost as one bottle!!!

This is the next best thing to using fresh passion fruit puree.  It's outstanding for cocktails and has allowed me to recreate several tiki cocktails that I had when I was in Hawaii where they used fresh passion fruit.  I try to keep this stuff on hand at all times.

I liked to make Ramen with lots of vegetables and meat and then stir an egg in and then have some Sriracha sauce on the side.  This is not a food you should eat every day.  It has a lot of salt and oil.  But when the Ramen craving hits you you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: A consistent 5 star coffee improves
review/text: I've been enjoying the delicious mellow flavor of Eight O'Clock Whole Bean Colombian coffee for years. Accordingly I don't normally right a review every time I order it but I was compelled by what seems to me to be a noticeable improvement in the packaging of this coffee. I ordered two packs of this 40 ounce package and they were delivered to me today. So, they've changed the color of the packaging from primarily brown to primarily white. But most importantly, the two bags I got were vacuum packed tighter than I've ever experienced before. This will undoubtedly assure that when I open that second bag a few weeks down the road, it will be every bit as fresh tasting as the first package that will be opened in about a week from now.<br /><br />It's always nice, because it's rare, to make a good thing better. Kudos to Eight O'Clock for the most excellent vacuum sealing of your product.<br /><br />By the way, do NOT buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NRD0DY">8 O' Clock Wholebean Coffee 100% Colombian - 42 oz. (Original)</a>. I and others have ordered this but the merchant shipping this ships, via fulfillment by Amazon, Eight O'Clock "Original" Whole Bean. It is not the Colombian and you will have to go through the hassle of returning it.

review/summary: No better value
review/text: A few years ago we got hooked on Dunkin' Donuts whole bean coffee that was only sold at their donut shops.  But at the time it was definitely worth the hassle.  Then the grocery stores started carrying it, and its popularity continued to rise.  But then we noticed the price started to go up. Looking for a comparable alternative, we tried the 8 o'clock Colombian.  It was considerably cheaper than the DD we were used to drinking.  But the hook was the taste.  See, I like to grind my beans to a fine powder, so that it feels like flour or cornstarch.  And when we tried it, we never went back to anything else.  Of course I will buy DD on occasion, but it would have to be comparably priced, which is pretty rare nowadays.  So the 40 oz. bag is a great deal on a superior coffee.  I'll definitely be going back to Amazon to take full advantage of a low, low price.

After many years of learning what types of coffee I enjoy, which ones are best coupled with cream, and ones that are simply too bitter to enjoy, this brand (and particularly the Columbian brew) is the perfect combination of smoothness and strength.<br /><br />I am not one to drink coffee black, but after purchasing this product, I am good with no cream or sugar :-)<br /><br />If you're used to the regular store brands seen advertised on TV everyday, I would definitely recommend trying a small package of this product. It's changed what I feel a "good cup of joe" really is! I no longer have to spend $4 on one cup of coffee, and with the scheduled shipping Amazon offers, you can't beat the price!

But it's really bad. Even when we make it really strong, it's still really bad.  Think IHOP or Farmers Coffee, and you'll get some idea of what I mean. I can't help but suspect some of these other reviews were compensated endorsements. We expected Starbucks/Peets quality. What we wound up with is not even close. I guess we got what we paid for.

review/text: Eight O'Clock Coffee has to be the cheapest whole bean coffee on Amazon, and while you are sacrificing quality for price, you aren't sacrificing too much.  If you're looking for something especially good, this isn't the coffee for you, but it's a nice backup coffee that you won't make you feel like you're money was wasted.  My biggest problem is that, with the large size, the coffee begins to go stale towards the end of the bag (but then again most of the coffee you find at the grocery store comes stale anyways, so it's better than nothing).

I have subscribed to the "coffee club," as I call it, as I intend to continue to use this coffee for the long term. I would recommend this coffee to anyone looking for an excellent cup of coffee for a decent price. For the price and quality, you just can't beat it with a shovel.

review/summary: Extremely disappointed!
review/text: I am a long time user of Dunkin Donut's coffee subscription, and was looking for a more economical solution when they raised their prices recently. I hoped that the Eight O'Clock coffee would be a good substitute, as I had fond memories of it from my childhood. I should have listened to my sister, who said that the Eight O'Clock coffee of the present lacked the silky taste of years past.<br /><br />The bag of coffee that I received was extremely dark. I generally buy dark, rich full bodies roasts, and I especially like Colombian coffee, so I had high hopes. This coffee was so bitter that it tasted almost burned. The beans themselves were extremely dark and smelled bitter. A whole bag later, we still could not tinker enough to make a decent non- bitter and acid-y cup of coffee. Even when we diluted to the point of a very weak brew, the acid, bitter taste remained. Maybe I had a bad bag, but this was a really unpleasant coffee. I finally tried blending a small amount in with my favored Dunkin Donuts coffee beans, but the unpleasant aroma, taste and aftertaste still lingered. I finally decided that it was worth the small amount of extra money to go back to my old coffee, which delivers a consistently good cup of coffee year after year. In my opinion, skip the Eight O'Clock and go check out DD's website instead.

My husband and I live in Argentina and were using a Costco brand whole bean coffee that was quite delicious, especially for the price. When we ran out I searched Amazon for an inexpensive highly rated coffee.<br />Well overall, my husband and I find this hard to drink. My husband isn't usually as picky as I am but even he finds this hard to swallow. The coffee is bitter, extremely acidic and the awful flavor lingers on your tongue after every sip. I feel like I'm drinking the remnants of week-old 7-11 coffee. Even when putting a creamer into it, it is still difficult to taste anything but off-putting sludge. My husband and I will finish the bag but warn everyone against this coffee.

review/text: a good brew, not starbucks, but not store brand.  Decent coffee w/ over 100 yrs of history.  I believe this used to be A & P coffee many decades ago...<br /><br />some sheen & shine to the beans, not as oily as I prefer, but good.

review/summary: 8 'Clock is great.
review/text: We have tried a lot of different coffees.  For the price and the quality I think you'd have a hard time beating this one.  Ethiopian is pretty good though...but a lot more dough.

review/summary: The smart thing to do!
review/text: This bulk size just makes sense for us!  We grind and brew our coffee for the work day at home and we go through this pack in about a month - we now have it on subscribe and save and for about $11 get coffee for the month!  Less packaging = less price and better for the environment.  Awesome!

review/summary: Love the taste; and the price
review/text: This is the first time I ordered 8 O'clock coffee. I usually drink columbian and buy my stock from Joe Traders. From taste point, 8 O'clock coffee is nowhere behind Joe Trader's coffee or for that matter any other columbian coffee. However, price is a lot cheaper compared to other brands. I got a 40Oz bag for $10 and I call that a substantial savings in a market when everything costs more. Overall, I am very satisfied and will buy again.
