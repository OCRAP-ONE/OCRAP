review/summary: Read the other reviews and *Stay Away*
review/text: I should have trusted the other reviews and stayed away from this. Some reviewers compare this to gas station machine cappuccino but I have had way better "cappuccinos" from gas station machines than this.<br /><br />Edit (10/9/2012) : I now see a ton of 5 star reviews in the last month or two for this trash! The surprise is that all of them are "Amazon Verified Purchase" and most of them are the only review the purchaser has written. If this isn't a case of cooked up reviews, I don't know what is!!

Can't taste any "espresso" or coffee.  My first time buying this Grove Square brand and this flavor.  Won't make same mistake again.  Will buy only 1 box to try next time.  Disappointed.

review/summary: Great tasting and good price
review/text: First off i am not sure what people expect. This Fr Vanilla Cap has a great taste, creamy texture and needs nothing added to it.<br />But AGAIN, i read the product info and it stated (sugar/sucralose blend)<br /><br />I use SPLENDA brand sucralose anyway in my coffee. If you do not like the artificial sweetener, then do not order this product. But do not vote it down because you didn't read the info and/or sucralose leaves an after-taste.<br />I have no after-taste from it and therefore I enjoy this product very much.<br /><br />I use this in the B60 Keurig on the middle setting (8oz if i remember correctly)<br />My Pros:<br />-Good price<br />-Creamy texture<br />-Tastes great<br /><br />Will buy again<br />For people with the dopey comments:<br />Let me add: IT IS MACHINE-MADE cappuccino! What do you think a cheap Keurig is? Gourmet coffee?

review/text: It tastes like a decent powdered cappuccino because that's exactly what it is. I noticed the used k-cup was very light compared to the other ones I had brewed, I opened the top and it was empty. There's no actual coffee in this, just instant. I think it's an okay value for the price, but I wouldn't purchase it again.

review/summary: Product Listing Incorrect- Actually Box of 24 bags
review/text: When I placed this order I had a hard time getting information about this product from Amazon.  The listing is faulty, it looks like you are paying about $19 for one 1.8oz bag, especially since it indicates you are paying $10.46/oz.  I knew this had to be incorrect, so before placing the order, I contacted Amazon who indicated there was a listing error but they thought this listing for actually supposed to be for 12 bags.  I thought this didn't make sense either since the theater sized boxes, 3.1oz each, was only $10.52 for 12 boxes.  This listing would cost almost double for far less product.  I suspected that this was actually a box of 24 bags since the regular sour patch kids in the 1.8 oz size were listed as a box of 24.  I took a chance and ordered this and I am happy to report that it is, in fact, a box of 24 individual bags.  I just wanted to share this information to help the next person who stumbles upon the listing.  The gummis themselves are actually quite good.

review/summary: What health-food foodies make for dinner when they're too busy to cook
review/text: Although I love to cook (look at the number of cookbook reviews I've written!) I don't always have the time or energy to make dinner. Rather than turn to a box of Mac-and-cheese (albeit a health-food one), I strongly prefer grabbing a bottle of this stew mix. It's delicious, easy, and makes enough for at least two meals for the two of us.<br /><br />I live in the southwest, so I know a good pot of tomatillo-based chile when I see one. This is at *least* as good as something I'd make myself, though far easier. Brown a pound or two of meat, dump in a bottle of this stuff, and in 20 minutes... hey, lunch just appeared! I usually have a single pork tenderloin in the freezer, so this is a great "pantry dinner" option.<br /><br />None of the ingredients are objectionable, either. No refined sugar, chemistry, or anything else that makes me crinkle up my nose.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Fairly bland soda, not bad, but nothing special.
review/text: I like the fairly rare (and tart) taste of rhubarb, so I jumped at the chance to order some rhubarb soda. Okay, I didn't really jump, but I scooted my chair closer to the computer and clicked some keys to order it.  The soda showed up quickly, and was packaged in a clever way to make sure none of the bottles broke. So, 2 "plus" points there. The soda, however, had a weak-ish flavor to me. Instead of making my mouth pucker up, which I expected, it had a very light, almost watered down taste, which left me wanting something much stronger. I noticed the calorie count was about half what it would be for regular sodas, so that explains some of the lack of flavor. Less additives means lower caloric intake, but also less flavor. If you want something more lightly flavored, you might enjoy this. It was not bad, but I expected the taste to pop/kick/sting a lot more than it did.

I don't see them at the grocery stores around here.<br /><br />I saw some complaints about the size.  However, the ones I got were one ounce, just like it says in the description.<br /><br />My only complaint is that every single one of them was broken into at least two or three pieces.  It's not the worst thing, as they are tasty, but I would prefer to have them arrive unbroken.<br /><br />The date on mine was less than two months out, so I was concerned about their freshness, but my concern was unfounded as they have been very fresh-tasting and crisp.  I got them right into an airtight container so that they will stay fresh.  If I didn't have airtight containers I probably wouldn't feel very comfortable about them not having a date further out.

review/text: ... that's what happens when you want something and you want it in 2 days.<br /><br />I bought this thinking that 1 oz was the size typically sold in one of my favorite candy stores. Unfortunately, this is much smaller than the "wand-size" Chick-O-Sticks I'm used to ... and, they were stale! Also, definitely overpriced - the 25-cent mark is printed on the wrappers, so if you paid $14 for this you'll feel ripped off when you know it's only $6 for the box. Was disappointed that my one of my beloved childhood treats came overpriced, smaller than expected, and stale.

Bakery on Main has solved that problem. When I tried this oatmeal, I was instantly transported back to being 10 years old again with a still warm strawberry shortcake in my hand. There are huge pieces of strawberries and this wonderful buttery shortbread flavor throughout this oatmeal. Such a treat.

review/summary: Just when I thought that it couldn't get any better than Caribou's signature blend, along comes Daybreak!
review/text: When I picked up a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, I really thought I'd found the best good-cuppa-coffee to please everyone in our household. Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee. With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.<br /><br />I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings. I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!<br /><br />I enjoy a medium roast with a kick. Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma. And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments. This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop. It goes great with a little skim milk, too. A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us. So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly). Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it. It's my new go-to k cup!

I heard you can buy these cheaper someplace else like a dollar store, but...since I didn't know of any places/dollar stores that sold these I bought them from here. I might buy these again for Christmas for my dad. (:<br /><br />Just so you know...<br />The candy came in a plastic bag, not a "Bit-O-Honey" bag, if that makes sense. So if you're looking for this candy in it's original bag, look someplace else. My order also came with a copy of the nutritional facts, I didn't give it to my dad though 'cause hey, it's his birthday, so don't let this little paper worry your loved ones unless they ask for it, haha.

review/summary: Tough Fruit Pieces and Bland Flavor Affect This Product's Rating...
review/text: Based on my experience with other Smucker's Orchard's Finest Preserves, I had high hopes for Smucker's Orchard's Finest Preserves Coastal Valley Peach Apricot Preserves.  I love apricots, I love peaches, and so I was looking forward to the combination promised by these preserves.  The five ingredient content - peaches, apricots, sugar, pectin, and citric acid - was a plus, as well.  Like old-fashioned, homemade jams, jellies, and preserves, this product contains no corn syrup or artificial preservatives.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the flavor embodied in this product is neither peach or apricot, nor is it a pleasing combination of the two; in fact, I found it to be rather bland.  Further, the fruit pieces were tough and very chewy.  It was almost as if Smuckers had used dried fruit, rather than fresh, as an ingredient.<br /><br />Like other Smuckers Orchard Fresh products, Smucker's Orchard's Finest Preserves Coastal Valley Peach Apricot Preserves had a very thick consistency which made it difficult to spread.  I solved this issue by scooping the entire jar into a bowl and beating it with my portable mixer. This broke the jell down to a spreadable product and did not otherwise affect the preserves. I thought that Smuckers could have cut the sugar content of this product so that it was less sweet. However, my preference for a less sweet preserve is not shared by other members of my family and most individuals will agree with their assessment.<br /><br />I was disappointed in this particular Smuckers Orchard's Finest Preserve and can give it only three stars.  I think that our local grocer's house-brand apricot preserve is far better tasting and a much better value.  If you decide to try Smucker's Orchard's Finest Preserves Coastal Valley Peach Apricot Preserves, shop around - I have seen the price as low as $1.50.

The squeeze bottle is great, though I'm at the point where I need to keep it upside down so I can get to the rest (which isn't easy to balance that way, but no big deal).<br /><br />Overall, it tastes very good.  A little expensive, in my opinion, for what I got out of it.  I will consider buying again.

review/text: Great flavor.<br /><br />I didn't really know what to expect, but was happy to find that this sauce was delicious.Takes like white chocolate and not the imitation white chocolate that has no cocoa butter, and only made with vanilla. Will be buying this bottle regularly for my Mr. Coffee machine for frappe's.<br /><br />I just wish the squeeze bottle was a little bigger. I know that there is a larger container being sold, but a squeeze bottle is a bit easier to maneuver when making drinks I think.<br /><br />Anyway, great product. Will be buying again in the future. :)

review/summary: O.K., but Not as nice as the prime example in the photo.
review/text: This little bonsai was not a prime example like the one in the photograph. Mine is smaller with a more compact shape. It also arrived in a larger and not as decorative a pot. And while it arrived in three days, it was bone dry and some leaves wre bent from the packing peanuts; they are great for cushioning breakable items, but much firmer than plant foliage so do more harm than good. I think now thst maybe I should have indicated it was for a gift (t was but for myself.) in order to get one of their beetter specimens. I guess it will be OK after a few more days of recovery.

review/text: I have to praise these cookies to high heaven!  I used to do a lot of baking when I was younger so I remember what "real" shortbread cookies taste like.  I have given in to buying commercial shortbread for years, but when I tried these, they were absolutely like homemade, but even better.  No aftertaste, no weird ingredients.  Just simple flour, sugar, etc.  Light, yet crispy!  Buttery and flaky!  They are the absolute best commercial cookies I have ever tried.  And yes, I do agree they are very delicate so can be easily pulverized if not packaged well or handled gently.  But even so I highly recommend them!

Thought I was left only with buying the expensive local supermarket products. Decided to give Durkee's a try. What a difference! This brand actually tastes like chives, and has a very "chivey" aroma. Well done, Durkee. I'm a convert. If you're looking to give bulk freeze dried chives a test, give these a whirl.

Much to her chagrin on her first shopping trip she found nobody carries this type of dressing in Texas. Actually the first clue was when we went out to eat and the waiter at the restaurant had no idea what it was when we asked. Anyway being a vegetarian salad dressing is a must so I ordered this as a surprise and she was very happy. I will order again when needed.

review/summary: Apparently the supplier read the reviews about packaging
review/text: I received my 70 cup sampler pack, but had low expectations about the packaging and concern about the expiration date on the cups.  Looks like whoever makes these packs read up on the reviews.  My cups arrived in a beautiful box with a flip top and each cup nestled in its own little 'cell'.  Beautifully packaged and absolutely ideal for gifting.<br /><br />The 70 cups were unique, although there was more decaf than I need at least there werent 15 different french roasts and 15 different hazelnuts!  I sampled about 10 expiration dates and they were all in the future, from 2-5 months away.  I have heard about some problems with many k-cup manufacturers giving incentives to their production folks for how many they turned out, but someone forgot the sales incentive because they made way more than have sold, so many places allegedly have expired or nearly expired cups.  Glad to see that wasnt a problem here.  I found at least six coffee's I havent tried yet (and I've had a LOT of different k-cups) but wanted to before buying a big box of them.<br /><br />Very pleased with the purchase.<br /><br />Edit: I've pretty much given up on Crazy Cups variety boxes at this point.  While I was happy with them at first when I wrote the original review, my last order for a summer variety had christmas cups in it, and the most recent 70 pack was about half decaf and the grove square powdered cups.  Guys, most people don't drink any decaf, let alone in these volumes and the powdered stuff not only clogs the nozzles on the brewer, you can get a packaged powdered coffee/hot cocoa/whatever for a lot less money and the quality is better in the packages.  Most of the powdered cups have nasty oils in them and fake sweeteners.  Ick.<br /><br />So since these guys aren't focused on delivering a quality product, at these prices I can just buy a bunch of regular variety packs without the decaf and powdered cups and get a better price per cup.

review/text: I gave this product 5 Stars because well...it's awesome. The value was incredible, and the variety was superb.<br /><br />My only gripe...if you even want to call it that...is that this is advertised as Crazy Cups 70-Pack that comes in those pretty display boxes. I know the difference between these, because I ordered this 70-Pack not to long ago for about $10 more!<br /><br />That's pretty much why I gave it 5 Stars. I got 70 awesome K-Cups as advertised, they just happen to be thrown into a USPS flat-rate box of sorts. I can assure you though there was not ONE K-Cup damaged, and I'm enjoying the hell out of these. So again, 5-Stars all around, just be aware you probably won't get them in those 2 display boxes, and that could really piss you off if you happen to be gifting these to somebody, MAYBE?<br /><br />Personally? I'll be buying again for sure.

review/summary: My favorite k-cup coffee sampler to date!
review/text: Okay, first and foremost I want to say I am in LOVE with my Keurig machine and I don't mind decaf coffee (especially because most taste wonderful) I bought this sampler and was not disappointed in the least. The day I got my package I opened it up to find 2 beautiful boxes neatly containing a vast variety of different brands/flavors. No duplicates came in my samplers and I was so over joyed with my purchase that before EVEN TRYING a k-cup I put in for a second order that same day and 2 days later I was beaming with joy when my next sampler pack came in. I am a coffee addict and I don't mind decaf (mind you, I need caffeinated coffee in the morning's before work) I just love the flavor of coffee, period. I don't always need the jitters so I'm cool with the amount of decaf that comes in these samplers. There were about 15-20 in each order of 70 -not bad at all, plus a cider or hot chocolate. All in all I recommend this product to coffee lovers of BOTH caffeinated and decaf. If you're all about caffeinated then this isn't the sampler for you, plain and simple. *raises mug*

review/text: I ordered this because I wanted a variety of coffee.  I was happy when it said absolutely no duplicates.  I read the reviews about some duplicates, but it was always the same flavor in decaf and in regular.  I was going through my box (which was packaged very nicely!) and saw Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee coffee, which looked great to me.  I opened the next box and saw Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee again.  I went back to make sure and there they were, both regular versions of Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee.  I went through the whole box to see if there were any other duplicates and found Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic twice!  Again, both regular.  I feel cheated out of two different coffees and think this should not read "no duplicates" because I clearly got TWO!<br /><br />Also, 20% of my box was decaf (14 cups), which is not horrible, but just to let everyone reading know.
