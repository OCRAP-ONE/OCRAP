review/text: This is THE BEST popcorn in a bag I've ever tasted, it comes close to being as good as my "homemade" air popped loaded with real butter without have the extra fat and calories.  The product is a bit pricey but I do wonder if its because they don't use GMO ingredients.

review/summary: Helped with illness and recovery!
review/text: I rescued a 3 year old Doberman Lily a few months ago who was not in the best of health, and after getting a checkup at the Vet, I found out that she has heartworms.  After all the shots she just received, she had to go through a lengthy treatment with more medications than I would ever want to give my dog, but I had no choice.  I was determined to get her healthy again, and knew that good nutrition would be especially important during this time of illness and treatment.  Lily received Olewo Carrots and Red Beets with her daily meals, and while the carrots improved her digestive health, I feel it was the Olewo Red Beets which played an important role in her recovery.  The red beets are a great natural detoxifier and helped get rid of the toxins in her system from all the medications. It also helped strengthen her immune system.  At the very beginning of her treatment she was sleeping most of the time, but after adding the red beets to her diet, she had more energy and was more active.  Lily is doing well now and will continue to receive Olewo to make sure she remains in good health.

review/summary: For the Discerning Cat
review/text: My dowager cat loves, loves, loves these treats. She meows for them whenever I walk by the cabinet where they are stored and will balance on her back legs to reach for one, if I'm moving too slowly. Although I had been buying them at a local pet supply shop, they kept running out, so I checked amazin' Amazon.com and of course, they had them at a decent price. I did have to pay shipping (Prime has me spoiled!) but they were still an OK value compared to the local, unreliable shop.

I have tried getting her to let me clean her teeth but she hates it so I love the fact that she can do it by herself now and at the same time it is a treat. She meows every time i walk by the cubbard i keep them in.<br /><br />Even if you dont need something for teeth cleaning i still reccomend these because cats absolutely love them.<br /><br />They came three days before the expected date and they are well worth the money.

review/summary: A super food!
review/text: This is such an amazing product! I am a busy mom of three and always on the go-- this has been a life saver- it it is my go to food when I have no time to prepare something but want something healthy (for myself and my family)  For breakfast, we eat it on a banana or apples, for lunch we'll spread it on a peice of healthy bread with some honey. I've even made a smoothie out of it with a frozen banana and soy milk.  My husband and i took it to Kauai with us and had it every day for breakfast and hiking since it is a great, satifying energy food.  We saved a fortune not eating an expensive hotel breakfasts and now he's also addicted.  It is the one food that we have that our whole family loves and that is also healthy.  I first tried it a couple years ago and have told all my friends about it and we are all hooked.  Then recently I saw Dr. Oz featured it as the one thing he can't live without.  We always keep a jar on hand.  I love this peanut free product and the original nuttzo.

review/summary: Truly a Blast from the Past
review/text: I think I was ten years old when my friend and I got our Spud guns.  They may have been advertised on TV.  There were two toy stores within our bike range.  The first had only one left.  79 cents.  The other store had plenty.  They were made of some kind of die-cast metal.  Who knows, even back then--1950's--they may have been a reincarnation of a previous version, although I doubt it, as we were probably the first generation willing to waste food that way.<br /><br />In any case, our big problem was ammunition.  My mother would let me have one potato and no more.  Once the outside of that was gone, we'd try using the next layer.  No good.  It needs the peeling to get a good seal.  Still, as someone else mentioned, it's worth a few pounds of potatos to get those kids out running around instead of playing video games!

Pop the barrel and get three bits for long distance shotgun effect. The fin at the end of the gun is also great for rubber bands. 5 stars.

review/summary: A dud.  It was the gun that never fired.
review/text: It is a very interesting idea to have a potato as your bullet, sounds like a lot of fun.  It claims to get 300 shots out of a single piece of potato.  The only thing I can see trouble is the hundreds of pellets that would be lying around the house, on the couch, under the furniture, behind the TV, etc.  But anyway, the most awaited test for the gun turned out to be a failure. The gun was a complete dud.  It was the gun that never fired.<br /><br />The construction is cheap...which I have expected. But what I also have expected is that at least it will work, it never did. It is made of 2 pieces of plastics with a spring and a plunger. I am a bit frustrated right now, with a whole punctured potato on my hand, and a worthless potato gun.  Makes me wonder how many out of ten potato guns work?

review/summary: Good Fun
review/text: Bought seven of these for my children and their friends (and one for me).  We played with them for a long time and the kids seemed really fascinated by them - nice to see them interested in something that is not electronic!  They are cheap, plastic guns that shoot potato plugs a fair distance - basic fun.  My only concern is that they could hurt if someone is shot in the eyes with them (or directly in the ears, as the kids tried to do on one occasion) and I had to monitor the children while they played with them as they tended to get a little over enthused about shooting at each other. I don't think they will be very durable, but well worth it for the fun we had.  Sometimes the potato plug does not form a proper seal (the gun uses air pressure) so you have to add more potato plug for it to fire (the kids thought the gun was broken) and it can be a bit hard for younger ones to master due to the stiffness of the spring.  One note, if you pull the trigger without a potato plug for the first shot, a gob of what appears to be petroleum jelly will shoot out - so don't dry shoot it inside.

I took them apart and cleaned them, unplugged them when they stopped functioning, etc and so am quite familiar with how they work, so believe me when I tell you, these are simply defective toys.  I purchased four of these guns and all four did not have enough compression to fire the potato pellet.  I tried cleaning them, lubricating them, nothing helped.  DONT BUY THIS ITEM! THEY DO NOT WORK!

review/text: I ordered this for my son and his friend as a gag gift for Christmas. I got two of them and one worked and the other was broken. The spring was cracked. Must have been damaged through the mail not sure.. The one gun that did work was ok but lost interest in it after 30 minutes. I also ordered them the Marshmellow shooter and they both worked and LOVED THEM!!

Now there's a sugar-free Oreo that tastes JUST like the Oreos I grew-up with! I'm in heaven! Sometimes I break them up and put them in my sugar-free Jello pudding, or my sugar-free ice cream!

They really are a blessing.  You could eat the whole box but they have a chemical in them called Maltitol that if you eat too many you might have to use the bathroom in a hurry.  Which is good because it actually prevents you from eating the whole box.<br /><br />I love Sugar-Free Oreos!!!

review/text: My sister ordered me as a birthday gift, a box of every cookie WOW baking company made, except the lemon ones (she wasn't sure if I liked them or not) and when I received them, WOW had included a couple of lemon ones for me to try.  Well I did, and all I can say is that these are the best GF lemon cookies I've had.  Pamela's were ok, but a bit too bitter lemon for me.  But these little beauties are amazing.  The texture is great, buttery without being oily, and the lemon is not overpowering.  The only bad thing I have to say about these cookies is that I have a hard time just eating one or two, they are that addictive and good!

review/text: Finally!!!!! I love eggs, but don't like to carry them backpacking for obvious reasons; weight, breakage and spoilage, but every powered, dehydrated or other egg-like product just tastes awful!!! But these eggs actually taste like eggs!!! I made them as just plain old scrambled eggs, omelet, and I used it in fried rice and soup. The quantity of the bag, 12 eggs was definitely 12 eggs, between 3 of us, we managed two breakfasts and plenty for soup. I can't rave enough about these eggs, if you camp, hike, backpack, even hotel stays where you have a kitchen, this is a great product to take along.

Checked again a few days later and found these, so bought 2.  Glad smaller packages are available.  I was able to make my cupcakes.  Still have most of the first bag left too.  It looks well processed and clean and just like real powdered eggs that it is. No additives. Will be buying more. Shipping was quick, and that is important to me.  I am anxious to try scrambling some to see if they taste like fresh eggs. I will do a follow-up if I do.

I knew they were going to be ok when I was mixing them up, they actually smelled like...eggs!  I used just a little salt & pepper for the taste test; I didn't want anything else to hide their true taste.  I'm pleased to report that they were, for powdered eggs, great.  I'm planning on purchasing more and as good as these were, may not feel the need to take fresh eggs again.  So, if you're looking for something to take backpacking or car camping.  Trust me when I say these are worth the money and you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Not like in the Army...
review/text: Last time I had powdered eggs was in the Army several decades ago....Well, I ordered these to put in my emergency food supply thinking they'd be better than nothing in an emergency. I tried them out as soon as them came in and I was amazed at how good they are! I love eggs, scrambled, over easy, poached, soft boiled, etc. I cook them carefully because I'm particular about their flavor and texture - no overcooked rubbery scrambled eggs for me. I followed the direction precisely, making enough for about 2 eggs (4 parts powder and 6 parts water). I cooked them gently, took them off the fire just before done and let them finish in the pan. They were very moist and full of flavor. They are very close to 'real' eggs in texture and flavor. I was very pleasantly surprised and pleased with them.<br /><br />I am especially pleased that they require so little water to re-constitute. I think the 2 eggs took about 3 tablespoons of water! That would be ideal in a survival situation, as my goal is to have my emergency foods require no water to prepare.<br /><br />I don't know if it is only this brand that is so good, so I'll check out some other brands and update this review.<br /><br />The only drawback is the price. At $9, they are about 6 times more expensive than eggs. But, if you're sitting in a pile of rubble that used to be your house, the cost wouldn't be very important....<br /><br />-Mike

review/summary: Best Powdered Eggs!
review/text: Recently I've been sampling a large amount of long-term storage foods (I'm creating a emergency food pantry) and this are by far the best powered eggs I've tried. In fact they may be the best product in the pantry so far. These eggs for all practical purposes are not powdered eggs, they are eggs in a bag. Powdered eggs (and powdered foods in general) have a bad rep in a lot of people's minds of not being real. These are real eggs without a traditional expiration date. Tried these with the family making scrambled eggs and omelets, and nobody was the wiser. The only things that distinguishes them from "regular" eggs is a slight bit of texture. Regular eggs have a bit more of a rough texture. Imaging taking a couple eggs and scrambling them in a blended before cooking, this is the smoothness you get. It's not a negative at all, it simply tastes like someone spent the time to create the smoothest, silkiest eggs you've ever had. It's like comparing the texture of a cake to a cheesecake. These are absolutely awesome, and are perhaps the best addition to my emergency food pantry, yet.

review/summary: JUST like eggs in a carton!
review/text: We needed to carry 2 doz eggs on a backpacking trip to make breakfast for a large group. I had tried the usual backpacking eggs and wasn't at all impressed, and they were much more expensive than these. I was a little unsure about this, but decided there would be enough cheese and veggies that it probably wouldn't matter, and besides they couldn't be worse than the powdered variety. We reconstituted them with water following the directions, and used a small whisk to whisk out any clumps. Following that, they looked just like regular eggs that had been cracked and scrambled. Poured them in the pan and they cooked up just like regular eggs, no watery spots, fluffy, tender. Cheese and veggies added after tasting them plain, I could eat these plain! Real egg texture and taste, in a tiny little bag! Everyone was very impressed with breakfast! I will definitely be buying these again! The dozen is an ample dozen, not a scrawny dozen so a great lightweight choice for a hearty fast cooking breakfast! Just be aware that you have to handle them like raw eggs as far as cleanliness goes

review/text: I've been waiting to try these eggs for a couple of years but hadn't been able to find them in a store locally, though they are produced in our area (Pacific Northwest).  The rave reviews made them sound great, and I thought they were going to be just the thing for an emergency food, like for breakfast or to add protein to Top Ramen.  They were fairly easy to prepare, but I was so disappointed once I tasted them.  They were almost flavorless, and tasted more like cardboard than anything else.  They wern't bad, just not good.  I was so surprised because they got such rave reviews.  The only thing I can say is that they are better than the Mountain House freeze dried eggs, which, when I tried them, caused me to gag (probably from their freaky texture).

review/text: We were very impressed with Ova Easy eggs.  They tasted just like fresh scrambled eggs.  We could hardly tell the difference.  I bought these for backpacking because the freeze dried eggs that you just add boiling water to just aren't very good.  These are totally different.  The pre-packaged freeze dried eggs sold at backpacking stores are pre-cooked then freeze dried and you just reconstitute them with boiling water.  These are raw eggs that are dried somehow and you add water to the egg powder and cook them for the first time.  This works much better.  These will be a part of my backpacking breakfasts from now on.

review/summary: As good as fresh Eggs
review/text: Our kayaking crew is constantly trying new food products for our various long distance treks and these eggs have just rocketed to the top of the "Must Take" list.  We have tried a few different brands of powdered eggs and have learned to keep the Tabasco close at hand; but these eggs are simply amazing in both taste and texture.  Mix in a few diced peppers, bac-Os,and a bit of shredded cheddar and you absolutely cannot tell the difference between these eggs and the real thing. Two of these packets fed 9 hungry young men who had grown tired of their every morning oatmeal.  They provided a real breakfast feast halfway through our six day trip.<br /><br />As a note of caution, one of our packets was missing the little measuring scoop that comes inside, so make sure you feel it through the packet before opening.  You need it to get the right measure of water to powder.

review/summary: Great eggs!
review/text: I took OvaEasy with us on our four day backpacking trip. They were a big hit with everyone. Great taste. I used them one morning for breakfast scrambled with onions, sun dried tomatoes and dried chives served with pita bread. Delicious! I also used them to make fried rice one night for dinner. I'm a very particular with the quality of food I eat and I'm not into junk food while camping just for the sake of convenience. I will re-order these to keep some with my camping supplies and also in the earthquake kit.

review/summary: Bought this for food storage
review/text: I bought these egg crystals for my food storage pantry.  I haven't tried them yet...but all the reviews have been good, and I watched a local news reporter make and eat them and he seemed to think they tasted just like fresh eggs.  With the horrible taste of yesterday's egg powders, that's good enough for me.  A dozen eggs for 5 bucks is a little steep...but they keep for a very long time...and could be a high quality protein, life saver in an emergency.

Both were well worth what I paid at an average of $.99 a can, compared to $3+ in my local grocery store.<br /><br />These are great chopped up and added to salads, but another great idea is as a topping for baked chicken.<br /><br />In a bowl combine 1 can of chopped artichoke hearts, 1/2 cup shredded parmesan, 1 clove minced garlic, 1/2 cup mayonnaise and salt and pepper to taste. Then in a baking dish lay out boneless skinless chicken breasts and top with artichoke mixture.  Bake at 375*F until juices run clear. Delicious and easy!

review/summary: Great Deal When on Sale
review/text: I was lucky enough to catch these on a Friday sale here at around $1/can.<br />These "Extra Small" artichoke hearts are about 1" in diameter, and are even good to eat plain as a snack. It's fun to peel the little "leaves" off one at a time. I always rinse them before eating.<br /><br />They would be great for pizza or pasta - I like to saute fresh zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper, onions and garlic in EVOO, add the halved or quartered artichoke hearts, then season with oregano, basil & parsley (preferably fresh), then toss with some whole wheat rotini or penne Or I use that mixture as a pizza topping. Mmmm, that's making me hungry!<br /><br />BTW, The can's are very convenient with the pull tab top - no can opener required.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I highly recommend buying these when they are on sale (though it's unlikely they'll ever go that low again!), and wish I had bought more than one case. Yum!

Not to mention the perfect size to top a salad or pizza without cutting up. Drain and serve these petite morsels, no muss no fuss.

review/summary: EGG WHITES are not recommended for babies under a year old
review/text: My 10 month old daughter is eating chunky foods such as this and table foods that are appropriate for her. This Gerber lasagna with meat sauce states that it is appropriate for crawlers (babies usually crawl way before hitting the one year mark).  Yet in the ingredients states that it contains egg whites, which are not recommended for babies under a year old.  I'm glad I read the label before serving it to her!  I asked my daughter's pediatrician at her 9 month check up about this and was told never to give a baby egg whites in any form, until after a year, as it is known to trigger severe allergic reactions.  Otherwise, I love Gerber 3rd Stage foods for my 10 month old, she gobbles them up.  But we will hold off on this flavor until she's a year old.

He basically sucks the sauce off of the little pasta chunks and then spits them out.  He has had other jars of food with chunks in them, so I know it's not the pieces that bother him.  Overall, pretty disappointed in this jar, but maybe someone else's baby would like it more than mine did.

Lots of kernels left unpopped, but not an overly unacceptable amount.  Sprinkled some salt on it, and tried it.<br /><br />Not only ARE there hulls left on the popcorn, the popped amount is so small that all you can taste are the hulls!  Other reviews stated that this tasted sweeter than normal popcorn, and we have to disagree.  It tasted plain, and the hulls really bothered me.  Harder than normal popped corn, it was very disappointing.<br /><br />I'm very glad that I only ordered a small bag of this, as it will probably get thrown out.  Unacceptable to us and a waste of money.  Everyone's taste may vary, but we'll take normal-sized popcorn for our snacking needs.

review/summary: Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor
review/text: To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words "Medium Extra Bold" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Amazon should correct that description  and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other.

review/summary: My Favorite by a Landslide so Far
review/text: I must admit that I have gone a little overboard with my k-cup sampling.  So far I must have tried about 50 different blends.  OVerall I must say that the vast majority of them have been pleasant, better than what I used to make in my coffee brewer.  Then I tried the Donut Shop brand.  When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about.  When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing.  Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe.  My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day.  Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one.  It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.  I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it.  I hope you like -- no strike that -- I hope you love this coffee as much as I do.

Green Mountain Nantucket Blend and Timothy's Italian Blend are also favorites.<br /><br />One reviewer remarked about Subscribe & Save costing less. It's only a dollar and a few pennies cheaper than this packaging and Subscribe and Save does not offer Donut Shop "regular" but instead has "Extra Bold". Also, this packaging gives you 50 k-cups as opposed to 48 (2) 24 count packages in Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about not having the standard boxes to dispense the coffee. I purchased a K-Cup carousel, available on Amazon for $19.95 that holds 26 k-cups; it looks nicer by my Keurig than cardboard boxes.

review/text: We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch. It is rich, syrupy and just a bit sweet. My experience, thus far, has been that the K-Cups listed as "extra bold" produce the best cups of coffee, but many of those are only available in dark roasts, while I prefer a medium roast. If you're a fan of a good, old fashioned diner-style cup of coffee (like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that), then this is the brew for you. We love it and make sure we always have some on hand.

review/summary: Great taste - poor packaging wastes k-cups
review/text: I love the taste of this coffee.  But apparently they have poor quality control.  These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly.  You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to.  Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem.<br /><br />It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens.<br /><br />I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them.<br /><br />Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing.

A good, strong cup of coffee is hard to come by when you are using some of these newer brewing machines, but the Keurig system is definitely the exception and this variety of k-cup is the best we have ever tasted.

review/text: I have tried many, many brands and blends in my Keurig coffee maker and this is definetely one of my favorites.  The type of coffe I drink depends on my mood.  Sometimes I want a strong, bold cup like, Newman's Own Extra-bold Special Blend K-cups, 80 Pk for Keurig Brewers and sometimes I want something more mild like, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NP30XQ">Green Mountain K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108-ct.- Nantucket Blend</a>  But ever since I have had my Keurig I have been looking for one of my favorite coffees.  The Dunkin Donut brand.<br /><br />This coffee is superb and very much like the Dunkin Donut brand.  Not bold or bitter.  Not weak or under flavored.  It is smooth and very flavorful.  It is the perfect crowd pleasing blend for any time of day or night.<br /><br />I have shopped all over and you can't beat the variety or the price here on Amazon when you join their club.  A great value.<br /><br />I do wish that Amazon would change the name by removing "Extra Bold".  It is not.  It is, at most, a medium roast.  Even when brewed with the smallest setting of the Keurig I would not concider it bold.  It comes out great on the medium size setting.  Very remanicent of that great cup of Joe you would get in the old days at your favorite diner.

review/summary: Save Money & Get great Coffee
review/text: This coffee is exactly what you would get at a coffee shop. Sweet and aromatic, not bitter or too bold. I like the pack of 50 and it comes in one box, so there is no waste of packaging or more trash to throw away. If they only made a box of with 100... We love the K-Cups and get great consistent coffee every day without wasting half a pot. My favs are Timothy's German Chocolate (desert coffee!), Donut Shop (mid Morning) and Emeril's Big Bold Easy (first thing in the morning!).

review/summary: Quality control needed ASAP!
review/text: Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control.  I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each.  In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in.  Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.  I hope the folk at Coffee People can rectify this situation, as this is my favorite coffee, but I will not order this product again without some resolve on their side.
