review/summary: You will LOVE this rice!
review/text: We used to buy this, then moved to another state and could not find it anymore.  Yay Amazon!  As another reviewer mentioned, this is not cheap, but you will LOVE the rich nutty pecan flavor of the rice.  It takes about 25 minutes to prepare, but goes with so many meals.  You definitely will not throw out any leftovers of this.  You can add vegetables or meat to it, but just as it is tastes terrific.  Also, the price on here with shipping is around $4 per box, so it's affordable for a great rice to serve for a break from the normal everyday fare.

review/text: We love this rice.  I've been using it for years but for some reason my local grocery store no longer carries it.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon (and where else would one look?). It's not cheap but it really is good! It has an amazing subtle pecan flavor....for additional flavor add a small amount of ground pecans and butter and salt and you've got a wonderful side dish.

review/summary: No Doubts Expressed by My 10-Month Old Twins - Although I Have Some Doubts
review/text: It's good to give your baby a naturally orange food if you expect nutrients that are normally present in orange foods.  Squash is one of the original flavor brands from the vegetable variety pack, the first case of Earth's Best I ever bought.  While sweet potato followed by carrot were their favorites, they liked squash right from the start.<br /><br />I think it was pretty innovative to mix squash with turkey (as opposed to chicken).  This combination worked well and they loved it from the first taste.  I sincerly don't think those of us parents had it so good at this tender age.  We might be handing the next generation for too much public debt, but at least we're starting them out with healthy and interesting foods.  But is this as healthy as it appears?<br /><br />I believe your baby will love this one if he/she is anywhere near mine in age and I would love to hear comments should others try this one out on their precious little baby.<br /><br />Ingredients listed on the label: Organic Butternut Squash, Water, Organic Ground Turkey, Organic Whole Grain Kamut Flour, Organic Whole Grain Quinoa Flour.<br /><br />This one was different in that water was not the first ingredient.  It is not runny, but all the flour surely absorbed the water anyway (note how much flour must have been used).<br /><br />One jar has 60 calories, 12% protein, 2% vitamin C, 6% calcium and 4% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/summary: Buy in stores before buying in bulk. Son Gagged
review/text: My son normally loves Earth's Best jarred foods. But this was a strong exception. I thought I take a chance and buy this flavor from Amazon since my son LOOOVEED the Chicken Sweet Potato dinner. I'm not sure if its the tomato or the wheat but it's VERY thick. It made my son gag. I thought maybe he wasn't use to it but when I tried it the next day he gagged again. Now I have 10 jars untouched. Maybe I'll wait another month before trying it again. (Son was 8.5 months when he tried it).

review/summary: More "fragrant" than flavorful
review/text: We bought this in hopes of turning our homemade lattes into white chocolate mochas, based on the rave reviews. I was disappointed by this product. It's not terrible, and does taste moderately decent, but really, I don't see what all the fuss is about. I've had plenty of white chocolate mochas in my life, and this product just didn't deliver. We usually use organic brown sugar to sweeten our coffees, and in all honesty that tastes WAY better. And is a lot cheaper!<br />The powder is a strange mix of ingredients - none of them real white chocolate. I don't like the fact that it contains Partially Hydrogenated Oils, and, I don't even like using it because it feels like someone just shot a dustcan of vanilla up your nose every time you use it no matter how careful you are. Or like you've snorted vanilla talcum powder. The only thing I can compare it with, is the odd way that microwave popcorn flavoring used to get ya right in the nose, before they removed the diacetyl. ... It feels invasive and chemically induced LOL.<br />Also, when you taste the coffee you make with this product, you're more smelling than tasting. Try holding your nose. Yeah I know scent is a huge part of taste, but this product seems strangely reliant on its phony vanilla scent, and there's really no flavor without it. It also tastes and smells completely unnatural - fake chemical white chocolatey taste/smell instead of real white chocolatey taste/smell. I expected much more from a brand like Ghiradelli, and for the price.<br />It's not great for the waistline either, by adding a whopping 21 grams of carbohydrate to your cup of joe, and 2.5 grams of SATURATED fat per serving. My organic sugar adds between 4-8 grams of carbs, depending on whether I double the serving!<br />Overall, it's fun to try, but not when you have to buy this much of it at one time, and is now a 7/8 full tub of disappointment sitting on our countertop. It's best moment: We experimented and tried it on buttered popcorn. That was kind of good, made a sort of kettle corn taste, aside from the vanilla powder nasal invasion.<br /><br />I'm listing the ingredients here, because I really feel that calling this "ground white chocolate powder" is so misleading it's unfair to the consumer, and I don't see the ingredients shown in the listing.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Coconut Oil, Corn Syrup Solids, Sodium Caseinate, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Dipotassium Phosphate, Propylene Glycol Esthers of Fatty Acids (not kidding), Mono- and Di-Glycerides, Sodium Silico Aluminate (Mmmm), Salt, Soy Lecithin, Calcium Carageenan, and Artificial Color.<br /><br />Just a tip, consider trying organic brown sugar in your lattes and cappuchinos instead. Not the "sugar in the raw" brand, but a real organic brown. We find it adds a nice (natural) caramel-ly taste, kind of a cross between a Starbucks white chocolate mocha and caramel macchiato - very tasty.

review/summary: Tasty, but bad for you
review/text: Wow, this stuff makes very tasty frappes.  As long as you have a nice blender, the end product is as good as what you get in fancy coffee shops, only for a fraction of the price.<br /><br />I pretty much follow the recipe on the can (using skim milk), and it turns out plenty creamy.  The substitution I make is that, because I do not have an espresso maker, I use strong coffee.  I put in maybe a cup of coffee, and subtract some from the milk so it doesn't end up having too much liquid.<br /><br />The downside of this product is the trans and saturated fat.  I had no idea this things were so bad for me!<br /><br />Another approach to making frappes, without the saturated fat, is to mix hot coffee with chocolate pudding mix (not instant -- it has a terrible off taste!), then blend it up with some ice and milk.  It's probably not quite as good as with this mix, but it's way better for your heart.

review/summary: not white chocolate, but tasty for mochas
review/text: Easy to use and good flavor. This product is a fine white powder, with clearly visible sugar crystals, that mixes very easily with the espresso and frothed milk for our white chocolate mochas. Product has a good flavor when mixed according to directions: not too sweet. Be aware, this is a flavored powder, probably not white chocolate at all, because it contains no cocoa butter, which I believe is used to make white chocolate. White chocolate isn't chocolate at all. The first three ingredients of this product are sugar, partially hydrogenated coconut oil, and corn syrup solids. You decide whether the price for this is a good value, or whether this is really a white chocolate product or, as the label states, "SWEET GROUND WHITE CHOCOLATE" followed by the very important word, in smaller print, "FLAVOR." We will continue to search for the perfect white chocolate flavoring for our mochas, but we are pleased with this one.

review/summary: Like having a coffee shop in my own house.
review/text: I used to buy a mocha frappe every single day at my local coffee shop. Needless to say, it was expensive. I had tried many different ways of making it at home and none of them worked until this product. The consistency of it is perfect and it doesn't melt before I'm done drinking it. Just like the ones I get at the cofffee shop, it stays thick until the very last drop. The chocolatey flavor is perfection in my opinion... and I'm very picky, having tasted many of these over the years.<br /><br />Also, one of the problems that I used to have trying to make mocha frappe's at home was that the ice would never get very well blended because my blender is a cheaper one, and I couldn't afford to buy a nice one like those in coffee shops that cost hundreds of dollars. With Ghirardelli frappe mix I don't have that problem anymore. Even with a cheaper blender all the ice gets perfectly blended.<br /><br />I'm not even sure just how much money I've saved since I stopped visiting the coffee shop every day and started using this product, but I know it's a huge amount.

review/summary: Great Stuff - and Can Size is Fine
review/text: I bought this when the pack of 6 cans Amazon offers was unavailable, because we're not sure life is worth living without Ghiradelli chocolate in our morning coffee, and Amazon's prices are so much more reasonable than those in local stores.  I was worried about the can size - but the three-pound is really just as convenient - it barely takes up more space than the one-pound cans on my kitchen counter.  (Granted, if I were keeping it in a cabinet, it would be a tighter fit - but still, it's not as bulky as one might expect.)  And the chocolate, of course, is wonderful.  Ghiradelli makes the best!

review/text: I love this product! I actually discovered it back in college as it was what my favorite coffee cart lady used in her "white caps". It is smooth and has a light flavor. It is sweet enough that you don't need any extra sugar and I like to add just a dash of cream, too. There is no such thing as real "white chocolate" so people who are expecting a heavy chocolate flavor might do best to stick with the regular brown stuff. No, it is not great for you, but I cannot imagine anyone that thinks most of the coffee drinks found in your favorite shops are "good for you". They are a treat and are meant to be enjoyed as such.

review/summary: Great Chocolate in Mass Quantities
review/text: Lately, Ghirardelli Sweet Ground Chocolate has been getting harder to find in my area, and when found, only available in one pound cans, selling for $6.99.  I thought I might try to find bulk pricing on Amazon, since I use this stuff in my coffee on a daily basis, in mochas, in hot cocoa, etc., and there it was, well priced with free supersaver shipping.<br /><br />What more could you ask for?

review/summary: Not the same as Ghirardelli white chocolate chips
review/text: I thought the powder would contain the same ingredients as the white chocolate chips made by the same company Ghirardelli, but they don't.  The powder and the chips are 2 different products.<br /><br />My favorite drink at Starbucks is White Chocolate Mocha, so I always wanted to make a copycat version at home.  In my opinion, the chips tastes so much closer to Starbucks' white mocha.  The powder doesn't even taste like white chocolate.  I wanted to buy the powder so that I can dissolve it easier, but didn't realize the powder and the chips are two different products.  I'm disappointed that Ghirardelli called both the chips and the powder "white chocolate," because it's misleading.<br /><br />If you want to make White Chocolate Mocha like Starbucks', you would need to get the white chocolate chips, not powder.  Also, Ghirardelli's white chips are way better than Nestle's white chips.

I called the company because I was worried about BPA in canned goods, but they said it is free of BPA, so that's good too.  This is so much cheaper than fresh salmon.  Nowhere near as good as fresh, but one of the better canned salmons I've eaten.  I add some olive oil, apple cider vinegar, sea salt, and a few spices and I've really gotten to like it.

review/text: Everyone recommends consuming fish oils for everything from ADHD and brain function to heart health. Eating salmon is the tastiest way to do it.  I live in Seattle, which could argue that it is the salmon capital of the world.  People catch salmon in the lake across the street from my practice and in the bay across the street from my home.<br /><br />Our grocery stores have oodles of varieties of canned salmon.  This was the best tasting and the best value. And with its low sodium content of 50 mg per serving, I recommend this to my patients.<br /><br />Then found I could save a ton by getting it at Amazon.com.  Because the 12 pack bumps into the free shipping level, you can't beat it.<br /><br />Oh, and salmon has less of the poison, mercury, than Tuna.

review/summary: Good Flavor & No Salt...Center Spine Section w/Skin & Bones
review/text: I've never had canned salmon with no salt added before.  It is not bad, but it is different.  You can definitely taste the salmon, but in truth, I've had canned salmon numerous times before that had salt in it and it tasted like salmon, too.  The drawback on this particular canned salmon is that it does look like cat food.  If you remove the bones, any large pieces of fish are now in much smaller pieces.  This may work for you, but it isn't exactly what I've become used to with skinless and boneless versions.  The really strong argument for this product is that this is wild-caught Alaskan salmon at a good price.  Plus, if you need a no salt added version or the ability to control the level of salt with self-seasoning, this will definitely work.<br /><br />I have considered buying the skinless and boneless version that Crown Prince puts out, but I have some reservations.  First off is the cost.  You pay more for cans that weigh less (though, maybe the 1.5 ounce weight difference is negated if you remove the bones and skin?).  Second, one reviewer said that the first can was so salty that the remaining eleven cans were going to be donated.  That is a pretty negative reaction, but three other reviewers gave the skinless and boneless version a full five stars.  Finally, the omega-3 seems to be less in the skinless and boneless version, too.  1.5g in the no salt version compared to 0.235g in the skinless and boneless version.  Though, if you end up picking out the skin and bones, doesn't that lower the omega-3 you are consuming?  So, perhaps that is a wash, too.  I guess I'm still not sure.  I may end up going to the skinless and boneless version, but for now, I'll keep up with this one when it comes to my Subscribe & Save.

That is where the wonderful doctor-recommended Omega-3's are contained.<br />Each can is sufficient to make two hefty sandwiches. I like to mix in two tablespoons of quick oats (to absorb the oil); some chopped onion; my favorite condiments and spices; and a bit of Redmond Real Salt (available at Amazon). Let rest a few minutes, and then spread it over whole wheat toast, or into tortillas or pita.<br />Great Stuff!

review/summary: High quality, appetizing, healthy, tasty and reasonably priced
review/text: I bought the Crown Prince Alaskan Pink Salmon, no salt added, to cut down on my sodium intake.  I eat a lot of canned fish --- salmon, tuna and sardines --- but am not happy with the high sodium content in what is available in the supermarkets, Whole Foods excepted.<br /><br />My low sodium diet is a self-imposed dietary restriction rather than a mandate from my physician.  I know that the human body requires only 500 - 700 mg of sodium per day under most conditions, but have found from tracking my dietary intake that it is difficult to get intake of sodium below perhaps 2400 mg/day unless I make a conscious, deliberate effort to do so.  This Crown Prince salmon has made the task a bit easier.<br /><br />The salmon has become an invaluable, healthy part of my diet. I use it in large green salads and occasionally as a quick meal eaten directly from the can. Not elegant dining, perhaps, but it works for me.  I find the taste of the salmon to be quite good, as I have long since gotten used to eating unsalted and minimally salted foods.<br /><br />When I made my original purchase thru Amazon on the 20th of July this year, I went on a 2-month subscription.  Under the subscription my second order of the salmon is due to be shipped tomorrow, the 20th of September.  As I finished off my last can of the original shipment a few days back, I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of the new supply.

review/summary: High-quality low-salt canned salmon
review/text: Excellent flavor without the high salt content typical of other canned salmon - it's so good I even drink the extra liquid from the can. Since the fish itself is not salty it goes well with higher-salt dressings like pesto sauce. Great source of supplemental protein and fatty acids too.

review/summary: Too much crunch for me
review/text: Good flavor for canned stuff and I understand from others that it's the "norm" to have some small chunks of bone in canned salmon, but I wasn't expecting so many little square chunks of crunchy spine - the texture might be acceptable for some folks but it makes me gag.  I'll stick with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003RWVFEI">Chicken of the Sea Premium Skinless & Boneless Pink Salmon (Pack of 12)</a> which tastes just as good and doesn't crunch.

review/summary: Blackened Salmon-Yum Yum
review/text: While not a big fan of salmon (I prefer the Crown Prince lump crab meat for crab cakes), I have been buying this product for a few years, mostly making salmon patties and occasionally eating it out of the can when lazy and hungry.<br /><br />I recently found a great tasting blackened seasoning recipe via Google search (Tom's Blackened Seasoning recipe) and made it up. I then made my patties as usual but did not put on the usual seasoned breadcrumbs. Instead I used the blackened seasoning top and bottom (I bake it, less fat). It was terrific! I cannot wait for my next salmon meal! Best yet, I no longer need to get my blackened kick from eating red fish at the restaurant:)

review/summary: Give me the skin & bones!
review/text: Given a choice between fresh and canned I'd take fresh, of course.  Given a choice between canned skinless/boneless & canned WITH skin/bones, WITH wins every time.<br /><br />The skin is where most of the Omega-3 fatty acids come from and the bones (which, as you become accustomed to eating them, become prized sought after morsels) contain a lot of calcium.  I used to be disgusted by the bones, but now I absolutely love them.<br /><br />The Crown Prince brand is very good.  Comparable to Trader Joe's wild caught sockeye Alaskan salmon & the Whole Foods 365 brand wild caught Alaskan salmon.  Kirkland also now carries an alaskan salmon with skin & bones, but in olive oil (the one in the black can, not the bear & wolf).  I like the salmon in water as I prefer my foods to be as little processed/whole as possible.  Fish don't swim in olive oil, do they?

I initially bought this product so my 11 month old could eat salmon without being overloaded by salt, but my husband and I love it too.  There are skin and bones, but not overwhelmingly so.  The skin and bones are not bad for you--the bones are soft and edible.  I will definitely be getting this regularly through S&S from now on.

review/text: Salmon is supposed to be a healthy fish to eat and is recommended that we eat the fish a couple of times a week.  I put a couple of cans of the salmon in a tupperware bowl, after giving my cats the juice and a little of the salmon (they love the juice, but prefer tuna fish).  For me, I add a couple of shallot onions to the salmon and a bunch of green grapes.  It's a tasty meal for two or so days.

review/text: This salmon is good stuff! But, you must be prepared for some bones and lack of salt. I have been eating Bear and Wolf brand--which is farm-raised salmon. It has some salt and no bones. I tried this Crown Prince brand because Costco was out of the Bear-Wolf. I "do" like this natural salmon, but not sure I would buy it again thru Amazon, as I bought a case of it. I like to eat this canned fish right outta the can, with olive oil and pepper--very good!!! Crown Prince is a good natural product. Maybe next time I will just buy a can or two.

review/text: This canned salmon is the real deal. It doesn't have a pungent fishy smell and it consists of mostly large chunks. Yes there's skin and bones, but the bones are brittle and edible (not to mention full of minerals). I can eat it straight out of the can with just a little salt and pepper. For WILD CAUGHT (farmed raised salmon isn't real food) alaskan salmon, this stuff is great.

review/summary: really good pink salmon
review/text: Athough we prefer red salmon for its higher Omega 3 content, this is one of the best brands of pink salmon we've tried.  You can use this pink salmon for salad or salmon patties.  It's good however you use it. I like the small can size because it is perfect for 2 servings with no left overs to make the refrigerator smell like fish.<br /><br />I do not drain the liquid:  Just dump the contents of the can into a bowl and "mash" to with a fork to blend it, then add some finely chopped celery and sweet onion and freshly squeezed lemon juice and enjoy! Sometimes I add some homemade ranch dip and then put the salmon mixture on top of huge plates of mixed baby greens for a delicious and filling meal.

review/summary: Crown Prince Salmon...an excellent choice!
review/text: I LOVE this salmon, and so does my husband. Sometimes I make salmon salad, but mostly, I make salmon patties that are to die for. Finally, after many recipe trials, I concocted what I think are the best salmon patties. To be brief, I take two cans of Crown Prince salmon, clean off the leftover skin, add half cup of corn flake crumbs, a half cup of potato flakes, and Mrs. Dash according to taste. Then I whisk up a half cup of mayonnaise with one egg, a little water, and a couple of generous squirts of mustard (I use Grey Poupon or spicy Gulden's. Mix it all together, then form eight generous patties. Fry in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil on low medium heat (between 4 and 5 on a control that goes from 1 to 10). You won't even need tartar sauce.

So we will keep subscribing it!<br /><br />Pro:<br />-- Less salty! So the taste is light and real.<br />-- With bones and skin its more nutritious.<br /><br />Con:<br />-- fish chunk in water - not very presentable when compared to smoked sockeye in olive oil<br /><br />Recipe: drain water, then add pepper, 3 spoons of mayo and mix.

review/summary: Great
review/text: Alaskan Pink Salmon is a good seafood choice, relatively low in mercury (compared to King Salmon and Tuna which are dangerously high). Crown Prince's low-sodium pink salmon tastes pretty good. It has the bones and skin which I prefer because it's high in calcium and other nutrients. Bones are soft enough to eat and they're actually my favorite parts. I sometimes open the can, rinse and soak it in water overnight in the fridge to remove more sodium.<br /><br />I was initially worried about the condition the item will be when it arrived, but it shipped perfectly, no dents or anything. (In the past, I've experienced Amazon bottles broken and cans dented during shipping.) Good job Amazon.

When I tried to track the order UPS does not have the tracking number in the database cause the number is bogus. for some reason I cannot contact the merchant to tell them what's going on so I have to dispute the charge on my credit card.
