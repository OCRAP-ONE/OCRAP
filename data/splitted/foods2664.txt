review/summary: Mix it with Sprite
review/text: I bought the lemon lime flavor to try and recreate a drink at a local restaurant called "Green River." It's super simple: just mix 1 part lemon lime snow cone syrup with 4-5 parts Sprite. It's very sweet, but very good. I chose to buy the Hawaiian brand because it had good reviews. Though shipping is a little expensive, which you might expect when shipping a liquid, the syrup is good, it was delivered quickly (I actually received it before the rest of my Amazon order), and it was packed well/carefully.

review/summary: My favorite shaved ice syrup.
review/text: I love snowcones. Year 'round. Even more than ice cream, if that's possible. Hawaiian Shaved Ice is my favorite brand of snowcone syrup. That's why I'm a repeat customer with them. They have a great selection of flavors. I have my favorites, of course, but I haven't found a bad one in the bunch. The classics are all here, along with some fun wacky flavors, as well. The concentration of the syrup and the nuances of flavoring are just right. I use a little snowcone machine that gets the ice to the proper consistency, put it in an ice ice cream cup, and then with the Hawaiian brand syrup it's as good as they have at the amusement park. If I have any little complaint, it's merely that the last bottle I ordered didn't have the little smiley face sun character on the label anymore. I say "bring him back!"

review/summary: It's just another black tea
review/text: and not worth the premium price. I had seen this tea before and when Amazon offer the $10 off I decided to try the Yata Watte & the Breakfast teas.<br /><br />I give this pretty much the same review I gave the Yata - in fact I have trouble telling them apart in a blind taste test. About the only difference is this is ground finer.<br /><br />Twinings Ceylon has a distinctive - as they call it - "bright" flavor, but I can't detect any taste that comes close here. This tea isn't that different than from PG tips, Yorkshire gold or any decent quality black tea.<br /><br />Second issue is the packaging, if you go to the Dilmah web site you see the owner patting himself on the back, for what a good guy he is, how he runs his plantations. He should try producing a little less waste for us consumers to throw away. First a shrink wrap holding the 3 cans together, then each can is shrink wrapped, an outer lid, an inner lid. The yata is in a foil & plastic bag and the breakfast tea has plastic handle on the inner lid. Not only does it gripe the conscientious consumer in me to see so much waste, but it is adding 2-3 dollars for something that may get second use or second best goes to recycling.<br />Comment Comment | Permalink | Why no voting but

review/summary: fine tea, but not whole leaf
review/text: I had never heard of this tea until finding it here while scanning for something different. Different from the PG Tips I've been using. I prefer loose leaf but PGTips are pyramid bags.<br /><br />So I searched and found the Dilmah web site. All the tea is from the same estates. Not blended, they say.<br /><br />One disappointment is that this is broken tea rather than whole leaves. What do they do with the whole leaf? It is 'loose', but not 'loose leaf'. The quality of the taste is certainly not impaired. Far better than PG Tips. More expensive as well.

review/summary: Robust Ceylon Tea
review/text: Not sure why I am reading the reviews I am reading, as no where in the description it states that it is a whole leaf tea. The tea leaves are small as to make a very robust and strong tea with a character. Whole leaf teas usually produce a fine and mellow teas and are not that robust. We had tried this tea from another seller when Amazon was out of stock and found it to be of very high quality. If you like a Pure black Ceylon tea of very quality, then you have to try Dilmah English Breakfast tea. It comes sealed in a beautiful container with a inner lid for keeping the moisture out and making a perfect brew.

If you are someone who is looking for a taste alternative and is amenable to cane sugar then this is a great alternative!!

review/text: I absolutely adore this popcorn, and have enjoyed it since I was a tiny child. Popcorn was always a very "friendly" snack, for me, along with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. Smartfood succeeds in creating an excellent balance between the high quality popcorn and white cheese in their product. It isn't too greasy, has a fantastic, lip smacking flavor and also is very light and airy. I am amazed that they sell so many bags at one time. The price seems a little higher than I pay at the drugstore, but, this is an online item.

review/text: I love popcorn and I love cheese, so naturally I love Smartfood popcorn. The white cheddar flavor is what does it for me- it's so delicious, I can eat entire bags by myself! I am actually thinking of having some right now as I write this review. My mouth is literally watering with anticipating! xD The popcorn itself is always light and fluffy. The bags are actually filled pretty nicely so you're getting your money's worth. My favorite part about eating Smartfood is the end- when there's a ton of yummy tiny pieces of popcorn at the bottom of the bag. They were usually the cheesiest. :D Can't say I enjoy having white fingers though.

review/text: This pump works great - that's not the problem.  The problem is that it makes the bottle about 2 feet tall when it is inserted.  That'a way too tall for your kitchen, or even in your cabinet.  All I can think is that it's perfect if you have a bar, or something where you display all of your bottles.  Otherwise it just looks foolish.  I took mine out, and now I just pour.

review/summary: Excellent product. Great energy food and surprising appetite suppressant.
review/text: I tried this product after reading research regarding the excellent nutritional value of the product - high level of omega 3, high fibre content, high calcium and iron levels in addition to its impact on glycemic levels and cholesterol. The research was conducted by St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and was led by a professor of Medicine from the University of Toronto. After trying it out for a month, I have noticed an improvement in my energy level and surprisingly, some inadvertent weight loss. It turns out that since this product absorbs water, it acts as an appetite suppressant as well. I can't say enough about this and highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to boost energy and add nutrients to their diet. I usually add this to cereal, but have also sprinkled this onto blueberry muffin dough before baking. Surprisingly light nutty taste that does not interfere with anything I add it to. I recommend the whole seeds rather than the grain which tends to make liquids thicken up almost immediately.

review/text: I recently read about how awesome chia seeds are for your health. I also read that Salba is the variety to consume because they are standardized and are the variety of chia that has been so thoroughly tested.<br />We got these chia seeds not too long ago and we love them. They are smaller than sesame seeds and very mild in flavor. They are slightly nutty and quite easy to incorporate into foods. I've sprinkled them in the topping of a berry crumble, on top of my bagel and cream cheese, and in most of the dinners I've made they've ended up sprinkled on that too.<br />I won't make any bold health statements as I haven't had them in our diet for that long, but if you look into the research, you'll see why I immediately wanted to try them.<br />Psst: these seeds will grow (amazingly quickly) when planted as well! So they taste good and they're great for you. Sounds like a good recipe!

review/text: This product was recommended to me by a physician - it was presented as a tasty and heathful way to lower cholesterol and weight - sooooooo nothing ventured....<br />I have been very pleased with Salba - I most frequently add it to yogurt and it provides a pleasant crunch not unlike the granola that I used to mix in -<br />It has a mild flavor and can be added to any foodstuff without altering the taste- It can be used in baking and/or cooking but it does then lose the crunch factor.<br />I plan to make it a regular part of my diet.

review/summary: Just okay Coffee
review/text: This coffee is not quite what I thought it to be. Taste a little on the strong side. It is rather pricy, and yet I found it on sale, so I thought. I have plenty of caribou and that should hold me for a while until the seasonal coffees come out, hopefully they will not be so high in price. Saw a review on the Kcup coffees and found that they got the rating of being simply just "ok", so it is more of the easy of making the coffee rather than the price or quality of the brew of coffee. I shall keep my eyes peeled for the cheapest place to buy my kcups. The day break of the caribou is the best variety of the caribou brand.

review/summary: Taste is obviously subjective
review/text: I find it interesting when I see a wide range of comments for a product, particularly if for a food or drink. Taste is obviously very subjective. If I was a Maxwell House drinker I might say this coffee was great. If on the other hand, I roasted my own beans (I do), I would say this coffee is disappointing. I bought a Keurig and Breville machine for convenience. I generally use the "My K cup" and grind my own beans. At the office, however, I do use packaged K cups. I prefer a stronger brew, but a medium roast. So far I have found Wolfgang Puck's Vienna Coffee House blend to be very nice. The Caribou Blend was too weak for my taste. This morning I used 2 k cups for 1 mug. It was stronger, but lacked any real flavor. On another point, I wish there was some consistency or change in language when k cups are described as bold. Too many people thing that means a dark roast. It does not. I see so many people comment that bold is roasted too dark for their taste (like Starbucks). Bottom line .... I'll use 2 k cups of the Caribou Blend until I use the 2 boxes I have, then it's back to Wolfgang.

review/summary: Very Smooth - Best Keurig Coffee I've Tried, So Far
review/text: I'm a big fan of Illy coffee. It is a very smooth coffee. I was tired of having to work (clean stuff)to make my coffee so I purchased a Keurig.<br /><br />I purchased a sample pack. The only coffee I was impressed by was the Caribou. It's a slight bit weak for my taste but it is oh so smooth and flavorful. I actually purchased this pack because it was so good. It's as close as I can come to Illy on my Keurig, so far.<br /><br />I also purchased the Caribou Mahogany but it has not delivered yet. I'm hoping it's stronger, yet smooth like the Caribou blend. I like strong but smooth. I'm not interested in bitter.<br /><br />If you want a delightful smooth full bodied coffee, this is it. I drink coffee more for the taste than anything else and I'm extremely picky so I was pleasantly surprised when I was pleased by the Caribou Blend.

review/summary: Good coffee
review/text: Most of the reviews I have read were pretty much how the coffee tasted to people. Since everyone's taste is different, I think it's a moot point. What is important is how fresh the coffee is. I found that each cup had the same freshness so that's a nod to consistency. As for my own personal taste preferences, I drank Folgers Classic Roast for years and since that isn't available in K cup, I've been drinking the Caribou Coffee blend as a replacement. It tastes fine to me and the caffeine keeps me going all day.  I haven't had any problems with using the Caribou Coffee K cup either. When company comes, this is one coffee I don't share :)

review/text: The aroma of this blend is sharp and bold, but not as appealing as some of the other varieties ive tried, semi astringent. I brewed this on the 7.25oz setting and found it to be strong and dark enough to use milk and one tsp of sugar.<br />The taste is underwhelming, and seems to be along the lines of an average at best cup of coffee. The taste characteristic is along the lines of walnut and brandy, which is nice but not present enough to make this blend memorable.<br />It is as drinkable as a mild cup of starbucks coffee...

review/summary: Doesn't Bite back
review/text: I just received my order from 1 Quick cup of this coffee today and was never so anxious to try a Kcup due to all the raving reviews. I brewed it in my B40 @ the 9.25 mug size and added cream and a sugar substitute. This is a wonderfully blend; not harsh not weak and it doesn't try to be something it is not. I know that sounded a bit odd but that was my first impression. This is my third cup this afternoon so I would like to try another cup without the nuances of the other kcups on my palate<br /><br />Not to be redundant from what the other reviewers have written; it's very mellow yet rich and doesn't bite back and leaves no harsh after taste. Can't wait to try it later @ the 7.25 mug size.<br /><br />UPDATE: Well I just had my Caribou @ the 7.25 mug size and it was as delicious as the larger mug size. A bit more after taste but again not offensive. Though I read that this coffee is a medium roast, to me, it tastes more like a light roast which I seem to gravitate to. I will brew it @ the larger mug size just so I can enjoy it longer. Caribou differently hit the nail on the head with this one. So it wins a spot on my top ten favorite Kcups list.

review/summary: good coffee but NOT a 24-pack!!
review/text: This variety of coffee came as a sample with my Keurig brewer and I LOVED it, so I ordered this from Amazon. When it arrived today I thought it rattled more than usual so I opened up the carton and dumped them out to count them -- only 22 in the package.  Looks like I'll have to re-order a couple of days sooner than I had planned.

review/text: For a regular cup of coffee, I like the smooth taste of Donut House Extra Bold or Green Mountain Breakfast blend.  I did not like this one at all--I guess it just depends on your taste.  I could tell by the burnt unappealing aroma of it that I wouldn't like it.  It tasted bitter to me with a little bit of a bite to it.  This one's for you if you like a more bitter/bittersweet coffee--it just didn't appeal to me because I like a smoother taste with less of an aftertaste.

review/summary: Smooth ideal blend - not too dark and not too light and no bitterness
review/text: Caribou Coffee is one of my favorites in spite of the fact I have to order the regular type online since we don't have any where I live. I ran into these K-cups at Target and thought I'd give them a go.<br /><br />I have occasion to offer people coffee in my office and the K-cup Keurig brewer is perfect for this as it makes just that cup for that person and it's fresh. Without exception everyone I served this too has loved it and asked for the name to purchase for themselves. It is full flavored but not dark and it has a very smooth taste with no bitterness (this is important to me..I find many K-cups to have a bitter aftertaste that affects the aroma of the coffee as well). A normal adding of cream and sugar works fine as well - you don't need more or less than your usual (again helpful when you are making it for clients and such).<br /><br />This is THE favorite for my office and one we will continue to purchase. Enjoy!

review/summary: Disappointed in coffee choice
review/text: On the recommendation of someone else's review which said this coffee was mild, I chose to purchase a box.  It is still stronger than I like.  I have to use much creamer and sugar, plus run more water through a second time.  Not what i hoped for.  Sorry.<br /><br />Would like a truly mild tasting coffee, there were some in the first sample box I bought, but the next two sample boxes had too many strong coffees and many tea cups.  I already have a good selection of tea, etc and only wanted coffee samples.  Am not sure how to find a coffee to my taste without a lot of waste.

review/text: I got this in a sampler package.  I won't be buying it again.  It had a sort of stale taste, like coffee that has been sitting in a pot for hours.  I like fairly strong coffee. Coffee People Donut Shop for example.  But this doesn't come close.  It's not weak, just stale.  And no, it wasn't even close to the expiration date.

review/summary: Didn't appeal to me at all
review/text: This K-Cup was one of the samples that came with my Mr. Coffee BVMC-KG1 Single Serve Brewing System, Silver.  I hate to be the lone dissenter, but I didn't like this coffee at all; in fact, it was the first of the four samples I've tried so far that I did not like.  To me, it tasted like over-brewed coffee--i.e., like coffee that has been sitting in the pot for several hours.  It wasn't bitter, exactly, but it just did not have a particularly appealing flavor.  I definitely would not buy this coffee again, and I would not recommend it.

review/text: Hi!  I have that coffee maker at home - the Keurig thing.  I love it.  And I love coffee - I have some every single morning.  I can't live without it.  I love my coffee maker - and I tried many, many, MANY of the numerous types of coffee that are available for it via these "K-Cups".  Let me tell you, that as an avid coffee drinker, this is hands-down my #1 favorite brand to make at home. It's mild, it's not overly bold, it's nice and mellow, it's not bitter in the least, it's not watery, it's PERFECT.  I like my coffee with milk and sugar and this one is just the BEST.  I am sick of the "Extra Bold" coffees they make for this machine - they all taste the same and are just too harsh for me.  This one - this Caribou one - ROCKS.

After having experimented with many others, I will stick with this one.

review/summary: Caribou Pulls a Fast One on Loyal Customers
review/text: I've been drinking Caribou Blend for years and it is just right for my taste... or at least it was. Got a new shipment in and I noticed a color change on the K-cup, orange to light green. Uh-oh, wrong product? I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change. My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad. I would have gladly paid more for my favorite. The new blend is far inferior. If you're a regular, have someone brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference. Time for a new favorite with a company that doesn't play sleazy tricks on its loyal customers. If and when prices return to normal, watch the return to the old orange based on "we listen to our customers" and more corporate-speak BS.

review/summary: Caribou Wins Hands Down
review/text: After sampling about every K-Cup out there, I have to say the Caribou blend is the best one for daily, regular coffee drinkers. I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffees, nor do I love the dark, bitter, bold types. I simply want a smooth cup of Joe I can drink daily and feel comforted it will be consistently the same tasting and awesome. Caribou's are the perfect fit for me. I would go as far as to say that brewing Caribou in K-Cups at home has kept me from going to Starbucks for over a month...it just tastes better!

review/text: I received a Keurig machine for Christmas and was eager to sample all of the coffees that were included.  Unfortunately the Caribou Blend was absent in my sampler.  Lucky for me I decided to pick up a box of this coffee once the sampler was depleted.  I can sum up my experience with one word... "WOW!"  This coffee is very smooth but loaded with flavor, even on the largest cup setting.  I was taken aback when I took my first sip; the subtle hint of berry and chocolate was so pleasant.  I would say this is one of the best, if not THE best, coffees I've ever tasted.

review/text: LOVED Caribou Blend.  Found a great price at Amazon, ordered enough to last 5 or 6 months.  K-Cups had a different logo than my previous purchases, and tasted sooooo bad I couldn't drink it.  After opening several boxes and brewing several cups from each box, each cup as bad as the last, I decided to return the unopened boxes.  BUYER BEWARE--I had no idea that the seller would refuse to take back or refund anything on "consumable" products.  I'm out a lot of money for really bad coffee and can't find another brand that is as good as my old Caribou Blend.  Any suggestions??

review/summary: Pretty much a perfect all-around drinking coffee
review/text: This coffee is just great.  Not overpowering, but still relatively complete, even when brewed as a "large" cup, or even 2X small -- many of the K-cups come out tasting thin when you do this, but not this one!  It's so mellow that some may find it to be lacking in unique personality, and I suppose that being a "medium-bodied" blend, it doesn't shout out anything at the drinker.  Still, this is a very nice, all-around coffee that is great for everyday drinking.

review/summary: Caribou Coffee Blend K-Cups for Keurig K-Cup Brewers
review/text: Caribou Coffee Blend is our family's favorite K-Cup flavor. It's strong and smooth in the extra bold package so you can make a max-size cup without it tasting weak. Other flavors we've tried (and like, just not quite as well) are Green Mountain Double Black Diamond, Coffee People Black Tiger, Brooklyn Bean Colombian, Wolfgang Puck Chef's Reserve Colombian. The Caribou Coffee packs seem to be more fully filled with nitrogen which makes them puffy and seems like it may keep the coffee fresher.<br /><br />NOTE: We tend not to prefer dark roast so this review may not help you if you like darker roasts.<br /><br />Also, if you read the other reviews, AZS was correct that these 80 count packs are cheaper at S*ms. Wish Amazon was a little more competitive on the price.

review/summary: Truly Disappointing. Product Changed. Not for the better!
review/text: We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible!<br /><br />Deserves 0 Stars...<br /><br />Update - a note from Caribou Corporate:<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us.<br /><br />We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.<br /><br />We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda<br /><br />Caribou Coffee Customer Relations<br /><br />The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change. Oh, well. Goodbye Caribou Coffee.

review/text: I have to agree with the other reviewers here.  I recently bought the Keurig model B77 at Costco.  And when I tried the Caribou Blend, I found myself sitting on the couch, sipping this nectar, and literally saying out loud to no one in particular, "Man, this is good coffee."  I like mine with about a third of a teaspoon of Splenda.  I'm definitely buying more.
