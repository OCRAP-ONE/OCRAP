review/summary: perfect for homemade baby food!
review/text: I bought these trays because I was originally using plastic ice cube trays and they kept breaking everytime I would take the food out. These trays work wonderful! They slide right out and are the perfect portion size! Love them! A little expensive, but worth every penny!

review/summary: Great product but not airtight
review/text: This product is a must-have for any parents making their own baby food and looking for an easy and convenient freezer storage solution. The 7 compartments can hold 2 oz each and the frozen food easily slips out of each compartment, thanks to the flexible silicone.<br />The only downside to this product, is that the plastic lid isn't airtight, despite claims that it is exactly that. Instead of the lid snapping onto the tray all around the edge and closing tightly, it only clicks into place in 5 different places, allowing air to get in and resulting in freezer burn. To prevent this I plastic wrap the tray before putting the lid on.

review/summary: Happy With Product
review/text: This product is sturdy and well made.  The portion is perfect. It has a lid which keeps food clean and easy to stack. I have one in orange as well as green.  My baby is 11 months now.  I wish I would have purchased more in different colors but I got by with freezing and storing in freezer bags.  I think I can reuse Beaba freezer trays after I stop making baby food.

review/summary: not airtight
review/text: this freezer tray is not airtight --- so the puree will get freezer burn. I've had to enclose the tray in a plastic freezer bag before storing. I would expect it to work better for the price. However it is very easy to pop-out when ready to defrost.

review/summary: Love the style/benefits, but hard to get some frozen items out
review/text: I am a mom concerned about BPA and wanted to find something I could safely use in the freezer, and found this one among others and I liked that this one came with a lid and they style of it is pretty cool.  The only thing I don't like is that when I am freezing things that are more dense, like my homemade rice pudding, they are hard to push out when they are still in their frozen form.  When I freeze the same thing in a traditional ice tray, I don't seem to have that problem (I think because it is flexible rather than ridged, the tray flexes rather than releasing the food)...  things that are more watery like frozen juice are not as hard to get out.  Over all, I like it, and it makes really fun round popcicles!

review/summary: Great product, but carries a bad odor
review/text: I have the Beaba baby food maker and two of the trays.  I also use my food processor to make food.  I have twins and make a lot of organic food to freeze.  I freeze the food in the trays and then transfer then to FoodSaver bags so they never get freezer burned.  The one thing I HATE about the trays is that they have a weird, unpleasant odor to them.  The odor does not smell like the foods I stored in them.  For the most part, I wash them by hand. I tried soaking them in vinegar and figured the steam from the dishwasher might help, but nothing gets rid of the odor.  When I first got the trays, I had to run hot water over them to pop the food out.<br /><br />Now that I've been using them for a while, I can easily pop the food out without water.  I do try to transfer the food as soon as possible b/c the seal on the trays is not perfect and freezer burn can happen if you let them sit for too long.  I do feel the trays are overpriced.  I have 2 trays and could easily use 2-4 more to freeze the batches I make.  It's annoying to have to keep rotating the food to try to freeze it before it goes bad.

review/summary: LOVE THIS PRODUCT!
review/text: We have 6 of these trays in various colors.  My husband and I both work and make our daughter's baby food instead of buying jars.  We make large batches on the weekends and having multiple trays allows us to make a variety of foods that we can then combine when defrosted during the week.  I love that they stack neatly in the freezer, have a lid (which a lot of other baby food trays don't have), and the frozen portions pop out easily.  Another reviewer wrote they use it as a serving tray for baby instead of many bowls--I will most certainly try that when baby is ready to feed herself.<br /><br />As a tip...the lid isn't completely airtight (as other mentioned) so I wouldn't recommend leaving the food in the tray until you're ready to serve.  We pop food portions out after freezing over night and store in labeled bags.  This is very handy for grabbing foods quickly.

review/summary: Easy to get food out
review/text: I have several types of baby food molds and this is my favorite. It is soft and rubbery so I am able to push up from the bottom of the mold to remove the food. I don't like having to run hot water over the back, like I have to with my other molds, because I don't like tap water getting on the food. (I'm a little obsessive, compulsive) Just make sure not to fill the molds all the way to the top because the food expands and then you'll have food on the lid. Makes for easier cleaning if you don't get food on the lid.

review/summary: Total waste of money
review/text: I am a total sucker for kitchen gadgets, but this just goes too far. The price is insane for what is essentially a glorified ice cube tray, which does not work as well as your basic ice cube tray. It's difficult to get the cubes out of this tray, it has an odd shape that wastes space in your freezer, and it makes 2 ounce servings, which are fine if you know you want 2 ounces, but I prefer to make 1 ounce sizes so that I can combine different flavors, or make just 1 (or 3) ounces if my baby is not as hungry and I don't want any waste. The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because of the lid - that IS handy, I must admit. But you can buy ice cube trays with lids too, that will actually fit in your freezer and stack well. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. Okay, it IS cute. I wish it wasn't so cute...

review/summary: great ice cubes for baby food
review/text: I bought one of each color, blue, orange and green. I love this cubes. They are 2.5 oz, perfect portions for my baby. Now that he's eating more, for example at lunch, I thaw 2 cubes for his entree (salty) and one for desert (fruit). Once the cubes are frozen it is very easy to pop them out and store them in a zip-lock bag, they are also very easy o clean. I highly recommend this product.

But, it's important for me to make him healthy homemade meals and this container helps me by allowing me to make large batches of food on the weekends and fill them up for the freezer.

review/summary: One of my favorite baby products
review/text: The Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray is one of our favorite baby products.  We use a steamer and a food processor to make baby food.  We put the food in one of these freezer trays, freeze for a couple of hours, and then pop the food out and store it in the freezer in Ziplock bags, labeled with the type of food and the date.<br /><br />I saw a previous comment that the serving sizes were too large.  Um, no they are not.  If you want less - don't fill the cup all the way.  Crazy how that works!  I fill the cups to the top, and my son eats almost the entire serving.  I am glad that the cups are as big as they are.<br /><br />Clean up is a breeze - we don't put it in the dishwasher, we just run it under hot water.<br /><br />To prepare the frozen cubes, I pop them in the microwave for 15 seconds - then stir.  Another 15 seconds, and another stir.  Sometimes, another 10 seconds if I want to serve it warm.<br /><br />Great product for those who want to make cooking their own baby food even easier.

review/summary: Worth the expensive price
review/text: I bought this product because I needed freezer trays and was trying to use up the remainder of a gift card I had. Im glad that I had the gift card to go towards this product because I know that it is very expensive. here are the reasons that I enjoy this product:<br /><br />1) I use it often, every 3-6 days. If I think about it like that then I feel like Im really getting my moneys worth<br />2) The silicone makes it not only easy to clean and durable but a breeze to pop food out without having to worry about breaking the device<br />3) I like that it has a lid, and for the most part I really feel like they did the best that they could to make the lid fit on properly and snuggly<br />4) The size of the cubes are perfect for my needs. they are a good helping size and I never need to feed my baby anymore at one sitting. I dont waste a lot of food, if any, and my baby doesnt leave wanting more<br /><br />suggestions to this product and its use:<br /><br />1) I have a small freezer, its not standard size and therefore things freezer burn in my freezer at double the rate. Due to this issue that has nothing to do with the product, I overfill these cubes so that the top is touching the lid and no freezer burn is able to form before I can transfer them over into a freezer bag<br />2) because the cubes are bigger I thaw them out the night before in my refridgerator so that by midday they are thawed all the way through and i can easy heat the food evenly from there.<br /><br />I gave this a four instead of five stars simply because they could have devised a snap lock lid system for the money they are charging and made this an overall outstanding item and also because the price point is a little high, Im sure that its not even close to that much money to put together some silicone! i think baby items should be reasonably priced so that even those that are a little less fortunate can enjoy quality baby products such as a way to freeze food.

review/summary: I love these, price aside
review/text: I got these as gifts and absolutely love them. Yes, you can use ice cube trays to freeze baby food & other things but these are so much more convenient for me since they're = a jar of baby food, plus the reason I really love them is that I have continued to use them all the time after we were done with purees. I have 19 month old twins & made all their purees & continue to make a lot of their food and freeze things ahead for easy defrost & prep at the end of my work day when we get home & they're starving.  I'm not sure why another person was trying to scoop the portions out with a spoon (?) but all you have to do is run hot water over the back side for about 30 sec and everything pops out no problem. I have the same issue w/ ice cube trays so I don't really understand the issue others have reported.<br />So, in addition to purees, I have frozen things like the following in these to = 1/2 or full portion sizes for my kids (depending on how old they were, obviously I need to defrost more of them as they get older): risottos, ground beef/turkey, small meatballs & sauce, mac & cheese, small portions of elbow macaroni (when they were younger & couldn't eat as much), and anything else really that can be smooshed into the container. These are things that would not work in an ice cube tray & freezing in a million containers or one big one is not practical, at least for me.<br /><br />It's too bad they're not a little more affordable but I do think they're great.

review/summary: Gets the job done but not a good value
review/text: My parents bought two of these trays as a Christmas gift for me since I make much of our daughter's baby food.<br /><br />Pros:<br />~ Easy to fill<br />~ Easy to pop cubes out<br /><br />Cons:<br />~ Awkward, bulky shape<br />~ Large cube size (our mostly-breastfed 7 month old eats at most 1.5-2 oz of food right now)<br />~ Extremely overpriced compared to alternatives<br /><br />I purchased the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003I868DY">Annabel Karmel Freeze Cube Tray</a> and not only is it just as easy to use as the Beaba freezer trays, but the cubes are a bit smaller and the tray itself is more compact.  It's also less than half the price, which to me is the most important aspect.  The Beaba trays work fine for their intended purpose but are extremely over-priced.

review/summary: Good product
review/text: I have two.  I like this product for a few reasons and dislike it for only one reason.  This is a good product because it gives you perfect 2oz portions.  It is easy to clean and store and fit in the freezer.  The only down side is that the plastic scent is a bit strong and sometimes the food scent stays on it even after I wash it in the dishwasher.  Maybe it is because I do not take them out once they freeze and place them in ziplock bags.  I just leave the food in and take 1 or 2 out at a time.  I still make and store my little one her apple sauce even though she is a finger food baby and not a puree baby anymore.  I still use this product and recommend it.

review/text: This tray is huge, bulky, and awkward in the freezer.  It makes 2 oz portions, which are fine if you want to feed your baby 2 ounces of the same food, but I like to combine one ounce of this with one ounce of that.  Also, the cubes are fairly impossible to pop out of the tray.  You can run it under hot water as other users have done, but that makes a big wet avocado-ey mess.  I prefer to use regular ice cube trays with some saran wrap on top!

My biggest complaint is that it is difficult to get the frozen items out of the tray once they are done.  I usually have to run it under hot water for a few minutes, which is not a big deal but just one more step.  Also, the price is very high for what this is.  I could use a second one but at this price I'll make due with the one I've got.

review/text: My daughter wanted 3 of these so she could make my 1st grandbaby her food. I bought them and then 3 boxes of the One Step reusable stackable Fresh and Freeze as i thought the latter would be better.<br />These are hard to remove when frozen and you end up touching the other sections and contaminating them. You have to run hot water over the section you want to remove. You cannot see thru the lid if you put different food in a container.<br />These are way too expensive when you can buy the other Fresh and Freeze by One Step Ahead that can go from the freezer, microwave then the dishwasher.<br />I do not recommend wasting your $$$ when yoy can have the same results with ice cube trays covered to freeze than placing them in baggies. Idea is to make the food freeze it and leave it until ready to use:)

review/text: The Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray is perfect for freezing baby food.  I made my own baby food for my two children, and this is a simple way of getting it done quick and easy.  Plus, it is easy to push the frozen portions out after freezing because the tray is flexible.

review/summary: The Best On The Market
review/text: The Best On The Market<br /><br />I was looking for a several good Ice cube Tray ,  in order to freeze what i need for making Excellent Iced Coffee In Granita Style !<br /><br />I have search and search on amazon and there are so many...<br /><br />AND THIS ONE'S ARE THE BEST<br /><br />And why ?<br /><br />Because it made from Silicone , it very easy to pull out the cubes , it does not receive odor as it has cover , it will never brake and it will lass for many years of use , it is much more comfortable then any other ice cube tray , and it is EXCELLENT for freeze stuff for Blender use .<br /><br />So for example:<br />You purchase a special powder coffee which the coffee company's sale for Iced Coffee (it comes in a pack of 1 Kg) , and if you want to make it in a blander carafe of 1.5 Liter  , then you take 250 grams of this special coffee powder and you mix it with around 50 ml of worm water.<br />You freeze apart 1.4  Liter of milk in this Trays , and you also freeze around 50 ml fresh espresso , and then you put all in the blender and blend it.<br />Viola - you have Iced Coffee same as in the restaurant without the need to use granita machine which cost $2000.00 USD<br />You can add Kalua Liqueur or Irish Cream Liqueur to the blender mix if you like.<br /><br />AS for the Coffee Powder:<br />You have to contact one of the Coffee Company's like Segafredo Coffee , Or Lavazza Coffee Or illy Coffee , and all of them sale's powder coffee for Iced Coffee for Granita Machine.<br />So you purchase it from them , and you use it in your blender in the way i described here above.<br /><br />Thanks

review/summary: Great for larger portions
review/text: These are great for making larger portions of baby food. I think I'll use them more as my baby gets older. For my 7-month-old, one cube makes about 2-3 servings of food for her. I love that it has a cover, and the silicone makes it really easy to pop the food out. But, it's pretty pricey for just 7 slots of food, and the fewer slots make it harder to mass-produce baby food unless you buy multiples of the trays.

review/text: I bought these to freeze my son's baby food. Well, they work just like you want them too.

If it wasn't for the price, I would own a few more!

review/text: After trying several other products for freezing baby food, I came accross this item and although I was not thrilled about the price, ordered it and was pleased with the ease of use. The tray is easy to fill, has a working lid, easy to empty once frozen and easy to wash. If you're making big batches of baby food (like I was) then you will need to buy more than one tray, but it's worth it to have a product that delivers.

review/summary: Great for things other than baby food as well
review/text: My baby isn't born yet so I haven't used this for baby food yet, but I HAVE used it for freezing homemade chicken stock. I just filled the 2 ounce cups, popped it into the freezer and then stuck the frozen segments into a ziplock and then repeated. It makes the perfect-sized little portions and is extremely easy to use. I love how flexible the silicone is and am looking forward to finding other uses for this. I would highly recommend this to anyone, not just those wanting to use it for baby food.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, it is not airtight so it could get freezer burn. But I have never had this issue and you can avoid it as well by simply transferring the portions to a freezer bag once it's frozen. If you are looking for a container to hold what you make in the freezer indefinitely, this is not the product for you.<br /><br />I like this so much, in fact, I would have purchased a second or even third one for convenience if it weren't for the price. Once my baby is old enough, I have a feeling I will be investing in another though.

We definitely got our money's worth!!<br /><br />After five months, we had a little issue with a funny smell (it did not smell like any of the food we froze) so I tossed the trays.  Scandinavian Child replaced them immediately.  they even tried to match the colors we had!<br />they REALLY stand behind their product. Their customer service was amazing; their genuine helpfulness and accountability for their product is so refreshing!!<br /><br />I look forward to having they trays again, and I would definitely recommend them.

It is great to make your portions and then throw this in the freezer. Once frozen I pop out the portions with ease and bag them for later use. If there is anything you need to freeze (such as portions of stock, or soup) these are perfect for that. A great multi-use product.

review/summary: I Love These Trays!!!!!!!
review/text: I have been making my baby food since she was 6 months old.  These trays are fantastic and allow me to make large batches of baby food and freeze for reheating throughout the week.  I originally purchased two trays, but my 8 month old baby is eating two servings for lunch and dinner, so I ordered two more trays.  Not only are they colorful and fun, but so easy to clean and the frozen baby food pops right out after running the tray under warm water for a few seconds.  Although these trays are kind of expensive, they are totally worth the money if you only feed your baby homemade food.  I wish that these trays would have been on the market back when my son was a baby, as I had the entire door of my freeze full of small tupperwear with baby food and these trays would have made my life easier back then.  By the way, if you want to save more space in your freezer, you can just pop the baby food out of the trays and store in a freezer bag.  I absolutely love them and I highly recommend this product.

I love that they are made of silicone and come with its own lid. The silicone material keeps the tray flexible so that it's easier to remove the food balls (as my husband calls them). Just a few twists and turns on the tray and the food balls pop out. They're so easy to clean too, dishwasher safe. I bought 3 more of these so I have 4 trays in different colors. Looks super cute in my freezer! :)  I would DEFINITELY recommend these to my friends.

review/text: I bought the Beaba freezer trays along with the Beaba Babycook. Initially I thought why on earth did I spent that money?? However, after making baby food for three months, I can say it was totally worth it.<br />The trays are indeed expensive, but they are far superior to your average ice cube tray. If you do not overfill it, the frozen food does pop out super easy. It is BPA free, so safe for baby. And it lasts a lot longer than a normal ice tray, which I also use to freeze my baby food if I run out of the beaba ones (I freeze in batches).<br />Just a great product, and it has helped making my daughter's food a lot of fun and super simple.

review/text: This is by far the easiest way I've found to freeze baby food and get it out again. The getting it out again is key - it can be really hard to get frozen puree out of ice cube trays without cracking the tray. It's also dishwasher safe. The only drawback is that it doesn't prevent freezer burn so if that's a concern for you, you'll need to put it inside of a freezer bag.

review/summary: DOGGIE MANIA
review/text: My dogs are absolutely nuts for these ham treats!  I break them into smaller pieces for the little dogs and can barely keep up the supply as they gobble them up.  They enjoy the chicken ones too but the ham is definitely their favorite.

review/summary: Probably the safest treat..dogs love 'em
review/text: Well I don't feel perfectly comfortable giving a Chinese-made product 5 stars but these are the best treats I have come across so far. I would hope the South Carolina company that distributes them will practice strict quality control in view of some of the poisonous crap the Chinese  have produced for our dogs, ourselves and our homes.<br />Besides the fact that dogs absolutely love them they are actually soft and pliable.  This reduces the danger that the extremely hard chicken treats and to a certain extent duck treats pose of oral and esophageal lacerations and difficulty swallowing. They are easy to cut into bite size pieces with household scissors whereas chicken treats require anvil type pruners to cut and fly all over the place..  As i said, "5 stars" until proven otherwise.<br />Purchased ours at Costco but don't remember who was cheaper.

review/summary: DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I purchased the Waggin' Train brand Duck Jerky and my dog became sick immediately. He was throwing up and also began to lose hair on his ear. Luckily I only given about 10 pieces in the week that I purchased the jerky. I immediately stopped giving him the treats since that was the only new item introduced. Lucky for me, my dog was able to recover from the issues brought on by the jerky. Don't ever buy anything that you can ingest which is made in China. Or better yet, just don't buy anything made in china.

review/summary: Potentially Poisonous - DO NOT BUY
review/text: Like the other reviewers, I agree that dog treats made in china are potentially poisonous, and should be avoided at all costs.  My dog is too precious to me to even take the risk.  Chinese people eat dogs, they don't care about yours.  I urge all consumers to send emails to Waggin Train AND Milos Kitchen and let them know these products are NOT ACCEPTABLE to Americans.  There's no reason why hard-working Americans can't make tasty dog treats, and we would make them with love instead of poison.  I WOULD pay a little more if these treats were American.  Rachael Ray has a terrific line of dog treats, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Y7TRJ2">Rachael Ray Dog Treats Nutrish Soup Bones Long Lasting Chews - Real Chicken and Veggies Flavor</a> which are made in USA and my lil Daisy LOVES them!

You would think this means you would receive a "box" of 24 Mars Bars or 24 Cadbury Fruit & Nut Bars or a 12 pack of the Cadbury Crunchies. These are the items I ordered and they all arrived thrown in a cardboard box.  I was told this is how they come!! How can you gift this?  I was told the master box is 48 count.

review/text: Who does not love Cadbury? and Flake is one chocolate that is hard to find in the States. I've not ordered it from amazon.com before, but I'm considering. It is a nice chance that it is available on here for people to try. This chocolate, just like its name, is flaky. It melts in your mouth once you bite into it because of its flakyness. It is a bit messy, so I suggest you keep it away from the kids. There are other versions other than milk chocolate. I've seen a dark chocolate, a white chocolate, a milk chocolate flake covered with milk chocolate, and a white chocolate flake covered with milk chocolate. My favorite is the plain original milk chocolate flake.

They are very good, and it's really wonderful to get my traditional English tea using my Keurig.  My only comment is that they leave a little residue in the bottom of the cup because the tea is ground so fine for the brewing, but otherwise, the taste is great, and of course so fast with the Keurig.

review/summary: Good Chew
review/text: I purchased one of these hoofers at my local PetCo and my small (16lb) dog loves it. The picture doesn't show it that well, but is is the whole hoof of a bovine, the toes with the bones and meat and skin all there. It is dried and not cured, which I am really pleased with.<br /><br />It doesn't smell bad like sometimes just the clipped hoof can, and infact even when my dog has been chewing on it for a long time I don't notice it being smelly. I've had rawhides after being chewed smell pretty bad from the curing chemicals but this hoofer doesn't smell gross. Even though it has more stuff in it than just a rawhide it doesn't get super stinky, a big plus for our apartment since we can't leave chews outside.<br /><br />Over all I recommend this hoofer as a good alternative to rawhides. If you have a big dog you may want to monitor them since it does have the toe bones inside and they are small.

Product was fresh, soft & had that powder coating that helps make a marshmallow a marshmallow. I ran this bag though the testing lab lol... It toasted well, melted down in hot chocolate, worked on candy sweet potatoes and was yummy out of the package. I plan on getting more for my holiday cooking.

review/summary: My daughter is hooked on these...
review/text: My friend gave us a package of these that her son had outgrown.  We were using the Gerber banana puffs and I did not think our baby would like these Green puffs (Spinach, Collard Greens and Kale).  She does not like peas or green vegetables very much.  Boy was I wrong!  She loves these things.  They are by far her favorite (second favorite: Gerber Peach flavor).<br /><br />These are a great value here on Amazon especially if you do the subscribe & save.  The HappyBaby puffs give you 40% more puffs in a container than the Gerber variety, so consider that when purchasing.  These puffs are a little "poofier" - softer - than the Gerber variety and maybe a tiny bit larger.  Neither is bad or good, just an observation.  These are a big hit in my household, and I figure at least she's getting a few green vegetables in her diet somehow. :-)  I agree with the other reviewer that they kind of taste like a Cheerio, but you do get a bit of that vegetable taste on the "finish"...

The jar itself is great, and I love that they are BPA free, but the lid is a bit loose, and so it doesn't stay on well.  My 10 1/2 month old son loves the green flavor, but he wasn't so fond of the apple.  I tasted them to see if I could come up with a reason.  The "Green" puffs were more flavorful.  For this reason, I will probably not buy the apple again, but I will definitely buy the "Green" again.

review/summary: Great for baby's!
review/text: Tasty and healthy snack.  My little guy loved them!  Though, now that he's 14 months and has a good variety of other foods, he's less interested.  Tasty snack for baby's though!

review/summary: good food my daughter loves
review/text: my daughter first tried this at a friend's birthday party. she kept asking for more. she learned the word puffs really fast. we went to wholefoods to get other flavors and she loved those too. I tried them and they were tasteless to me so I don't know why she likes them but she does. at least they are orgainc. but a bit pricey but it's worth it.
