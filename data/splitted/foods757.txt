review/summary: GREAT for low carb/glycemic diets
review/text: This is my favorite flavor but all the BOLD flavors are helping me stay on my low carb diet.  They taste great, crunchy, mouth full of flavor.  My whole office is now eating my "diet food."  If the sodium is high for your diet, mix them 50:50 with plain unsalted almonds. just YUMMY!

review/summary: Full of flavor
review/text: To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor.

review/summary: Wasabi Soy Flavor is too salty!
review/text: I got this wasabi soy flavor a few weeks ago. Tastes all right. But last week I got up out of bed and I was dizzy. I thought, "hey that happens, no big deal..." A few days ago I was running and I got really light headed. I thought, "hey that happens, it's hot out..." But yesterday I ate a few of these and I realized, "hey these are really salty" Now I don't know if all these things are related, but if there's one thing i'm sure of - it's that these are pretty salty.

review/text: I love the lime and chili almonds from blue diamond and they are a great snack if you are on a low carb diet. In addition buying the 3-pack of 16oz bags at amazon is a great deal considering that the 6oz can usually costs $3.79 at my grocery store. At first I thought "When am I ever going to finish 3x 16oz bags of almonds" but that's no problem at all. I even have to trick myself and put just a few in a bowl so I won't eat half the bag on one evening. I am addicted to lime and chili almonds and I am O.K. with it. I hope you will enjoy them too.

review/text: I am so delighted to get these Salt and vinegar Almonds.  None of the stores near me carry them.  They are actually great for my diet.  I can eat as many as I like yet the amount has less calories than if I was eating chips.  I can only eat so many nuts at a time while I can pig out on chips and waste lots of calories. My friends are always digging in my closet to see if I have any when they visit.  Love them.<br /><br />mls

review/text: We discovered these Blue Diamond almond snacks while on vacation a couple of months ago.  We loved them!  Our favorites are the Lime and Chili as well as the Salt and Vinegar.  They are very tasty as well as healthy.  When we got home, we purchased them from Amazon.  We bought the 1.5 ounce snack bags.  They are perfect for lunches or travel snacks.  They also help with portion control!<br />By purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, we are able to get them for $1 or less per bag.  When we purchased them from a convenience store on our vacation we paid $2+ per bag.  It's a great savings to buy them here.

review/summary: A good flavor but not bold in comparison to some of the other flavors and more salt!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word "Bold" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a "Bold" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!

They are both Low Carb, which is a big plus, (only 1 Carb per cup of milk) (2) Two they both taste good,(It has a refreshing nutty taste, closer in taste to real milk)(3)three they don't have any sugar cane or any other sweeteners mixed in or any odd chemicals or ingredients that would be bad for you, which is a huge plus for me, and (4) Fourth I love the fact that it has Omega 3's packed naturally into the milk. Hemp naturally has its own Omega 3's, so it's not added it's there naturally. AND Omega 3's are really important for the brain. So, since I can't drink Raw Milk, because of Casein sensitivities. . .I now choose Living Harvest Original and Vanilla unsweetened to drink and cook with. I hope they will continue to make these two milks.

review/text: I've tried all of the major hemp milk brands, and this one is by far the best.  It has a smooth, creamy texture and pleasant taste, one similar to half & half.  I use it in smoothies, on cereal, and add it to tea and coffee.

I've tried this product again and I still like it and now have no worries about carageenan.)<br />I really liked this. It has a nice consistency and tastes good, AND it's unsweetened. And the price is good here on Amazon.

review/summary: Great with Vanilla, Hard to find!
review/text: Just got my 12 pack. I wasn't sure what it would taste like because I couldn't find the UNSWEETENED AND VANILLA anywhere.<br /><br />I could barely taste the Vanilla, but it was better than the Unsweetened. Unlike many unsweetened products that taste like water, this has great consistency. It is now our #1 go to milk.<br /><br />I do wish it was a little cheaper, but until they sell more of it in the retail, I won't expect that to change. Also do a subscribe and save (for every 6 months) and save another 15% or so.

review/text: I was looking for a milk-alternative for my son because of concerns/issues with cow's milk. I researched the other alternatives and decided that Hemp Milk was the best choice.  The calcium, Vitamin D, calories are similar (if not more than) cow's milk.  The natural Omega 3, no sugar (cow's milk has 11g), and other nutrients made it the perfect choice.  He's getting everything milk provides without the gas/constipation that came from drinking cow's milk.  It works well for us!

review/summary: This is the future
review/text: Hemp is the future with so many benefits exceeding not only milk(where you get a product from a animal that typically lives 25 yrs but in production farms only 5 because of the high amounts of constant impregnating and milking which infects,weakens the cows utters( "pus" is a problem) which then need harmful antibiotics. plus there giving hormones to produce more milk and they leave a huge carbon(methane bad) imprint on the planet ,yeah we don't like to look at how we really get our food.This is the only??? civilized country that doesn't allow hemp farming-BS! knowledge is power and we can't afford to have people who's ideology is so antiquated and easily stereotypical of many BS stereotypes in the US. Sorry about the rant but I'm passionate about the "right" things that benefit this country/people and hemp, which offers us and was used in the past for 1000's of yrs. for clothing, paper and now it's many edible health attributes is the way to go. just watch how the USDA and lobbyist  for the milk, paper, clothing industries will try and "mislabel" hemp. this is a great product and who needs any sugar(slow poison) in a food product? In terms of sugar, Stevia is the way to go, the only naturally derived sweetener which offers nutritional value(Puritin's Pride, just purchased 5?! boxes of 100 packets each for approx. $25)

But taste is a personally subjective judgement.<br /><br />*The packaging: I do not see how 25 fairly large and thick foil packets and a rather thick, heavy and large round box (they are much larger than they look in the pics) can be ecologically preferable to 25 K-cups from that standpoint. Kind of a close tie imho.<br /><br />*No more convenient than scooping loose ground coffee into a Solofill which I use.

review/summary: Not bad!
review/text: It doesn't have the same nutty sweet pastry smell as the original Dunkin Donuts brand, but it's not bad either. The packaging is much bigger than it appears in the pictures, and you are best using 1/2 to 2/3 of a serving pack instead of the whole pouch. So instead of 25 cups of coffee from this, expect probably closer to 35-40 or so depending on how much you use when you find your taste.<br /><br />I would order these again!

review/summary: Coffee is "OK," packaging is terrible
review/text: The coffee itself is a decent brew - the flavor is there, but it just seems muted.  It's not as robust as other "Donut" coffees.  These are marketed along with the EkoBrew K-Cup replacement, which is how I have been using them.  The thing is - these "single serve packets" don't fit into the Ekobrew K-cup - there is too much coffee. There is no practical way to "save" the remaining grounds for use another time/day.  I don't drink the same flavor every day, so it would be a few days before I rotate back to this flavor, and then I'd have to open another package to even out the amount - leaving me with another partial package.<br /><br />In summary: taste is there, but not "rich" like other donut coffees.  Package size leaves a lot to be desired.

I prefer the Donut Cafe, Sumatran, French Roast, Breakfast Blend, West Coast, then Honduran.  They each have subtle differences and are a good alternative to more expensive Green Mountain (K-cups) varieties.  These tend to work better with the My K Cup (reusable filter) than Folgers or other regular coffees due to the finer grind and package size.  I paid $3.82 per 25 count container on my last order before the price went back up to $11.99 and would pay that again.  I don't think I would pay regular price however.

review/text: I found this coffee to have a nice smooth flavor with not a whole lot of bitterness. The only complaint I really have is that these premeasured packets are supposed to be a perfect measure of coffee for the Ekojava reusable k-cup. However, there seems to be too much coffee in these packets. If I try using the entire packet it seems to bog down my Cuisinart Keurig brewer and sometimes bogs it down so much that it will not even make a full cup of coffee. I have found that by using most but not all of the coffee in the packet that it seems to brew much easier.

review/text: Mixing with lower percentages of chocolate to make truffles.I made a ganache with full 70.4% and it was a tad bit chalky, but the flavor is great, especially for coating as well. Product came in unmelted (yay!) And packaged well. Definitely buying again for such an amazing price!

review/text: Chocolate freaks agree that callebaut is amongst the best of the best chocolates. These are fabulous in homemade chocolate chip ice cream, or melted into any chocolate recipe. They used to make straight bars for eating but for some reason they aren't oriented to the consumer market any longer. A shame.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I'm picky when comes to chocolate. I like dark chocolate, at least 70% of cocoa content or more. Recently I bought a bag of Nest semi-sweet chocolete chips, and I ended up through it away--it's extremely rear for me to throw away food that didn't go bad (I even don't take expiration date seriously). But those chocolate chips tasted weird to me. No, they didn't go bad, I'm pretty sure the "strange" taste was intended, in other words, that product just doesn't work for me.<br /><br />These dark chocolate chips taste great! No strange taste, and not overly sweet. The package is simple, but given the taste, I believe it's real quality product.<br /><br />I would give it 10 starts if possible.

review/text: I was looking for some vanilla powder for my homemade lattes. I saw this was offered via Amazon prime (ie, i'd get it fast). So, I went with it.<br /><br />Well, there's 20 bucks down the drain. This is good-sized amount of what is essentially a tasteless, sweetish powder. No beautiful vanilla scent. No beautiful vanilla taste. I ended putting 2 teaspoons worth trying to get some vanilla flavor (without much luck).<br /><br />Spare yourself. Skip this. Find a different vanilla powder. I totally regret buying this.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: Deceptive product description
review/text: The description ("Product Description" right above) says that hulled barley is also called pearled. This is nonsense: pearled and hulled are two different things:<br /><br />1. "hulled" is whole grain with only the husk removed<br />2. "pearled" means polished (meaning it's low in nutrients, just like it is with rice).<br /><br />What you want is hulled. What you DON'T WANT is pearled.<br /><br />And so, which kind is this product? Pearled or hulled? Why can't the seller post an adequately informative description of their own product? I'll remove this warning once the product description is corrected.

The barley was very clean, and could be put right into the grinder without any further sorting, winnowing, or cleaning. I ground it into a wonderful flower that made spectacular bread.<br /><br />I don't know how this product works if you are getting it for sprouting, but I can say it makes excellent flour and bread.

A hint, do not hold under running facet to soften, they break, fill a large plate with water and gently push down. One at a time.<br />I am using my food proceesor to make a big container of cabbage, carrots and cilantro, add rice vinegar, and the continer keeps for a week. It takes just minute to soften a wrap, add the veggies, dash of soy , and wrap and let dry. yum.<br /><br />a week later, i am having issues, 1/2 down the first package the papers are cracked, almost in half, I store flat on a shelf, in bag,use two hands to bring out,,so removed a star

review/text: I must say that I love spring/summer rolls and had to try them out.  So, I read up online for which ones were the best and found these.  I tried them and absolutely love them.  Very very easy to make these rolls at home, so I am pleased that for the cost of these and some veggies, I can make them for a fraction of what they cost in the restaurant.<br /><br />It'll take me quite a while to go through three packages.  Personally, I think there were way more than 30 pieces to a package, but then again, maybe it's just my excitement!

review/text: I ordered these to make Thai Shrimp Rolls and I found of all the brands I tried, these were the best.  They handle beautifully and taste great.  They're very simply to use, just run under hot water for 5-7 seconds and although they may seem stiff at first, they'll continue to soften as you are loading them up with your ingredients and will roll perfectly every time.  I tried other brands that were thicker and tasted rubbery and others that were so flimsy they fell apart.  I also found the taste superior - they result in a clean refreshing roll and have no cardboard like taste as many other brands do.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: I buy this exact same product at a large oriental market here in Florida...same size package for $1.49. I think they are fantastic for making sushi summer rolls. Make sure you are rolling them tight enough and don't soak them as long as the package says...as some of the product you add will add more moisture...I actually spritz mine instead of soaking and you can always spritz a little water on them later if need be. These performed for me just as they should.

review/text: I tried making eggrolls with these, and they just totally don't work if you're going to fry them. The rice paper sticks to the papertowels, and to the other eggrolls, and they fall apart when you try to remove them. When they're first wet and wrapped, they're really flimsy as well. They easily fall apart. Not good for real eggrolls. I'm dumping these things, as I have no use for them.

review/text: I'll make it brief.  These are terriibbllee!  They don't have a taste, so, it isn't that.  It's the texture.  When you wet them and they become pliable, they become slippery and rubbery when they are in your mouth.  I can't even compare them to anything else because they aren't food-like at all.  If texture is as important to you with food as it is for me, don't buy these!!

It was warm still in Arizona in September, but this was something you would expect to happen to chocolate candy but not to gummi rings or bears.  Be warned if you order this brand in warm months you may open the box to find a scary looking surprise. This has never happened to me with the Haribo brand so I will stick to those from now on.  Amazon did refund the price, they are great about that if you call them up and whine a little.

review/text: This is what I wanted: Solo brand almond paste. In conjunction with other purchases, it shipped for free, and it was cheaper than anything I can get locally (Florida panhandle). What I found odd is that the cans arrived loosely rolling in a box with some bubble wrap. I had wondered about the four-can "case," but hadn't wanted to look a gift horse in the mouth. I am still happy with my gift horse (it's almond paste: it's nearly always sweetened and flavored; if you want it plain, make your own, but it won't be as smooth), but it was a little odd.

review/summary: Almost perfect oil.
review/text: This is the non-organic version of its organic sister.  I've used them both and cannot see a difference.  Therefore, I'm repeating the same review I published for the organic version without any reservations.<br /><br />My favorite oil "cold pressed virgin olive oil" has one big flaw; it cannot handle high temperatures, and can be a little too flavorful for some dishes. And forget about what's called "pure olive oil" for those problems. It is no better than any other commercial oil. That's where the canola oil comes in. It's actually better than olive oil in some other ways, notably the omega-3 content. But it's not easy to find cold pressed canola oil, and when you do it's priced at obscene levels.<br /><br />I've been delighted to find out about this product, and it hasn't been disappointing. I use it generously in many dishes except in desserts, for which I use virgin coconut oil (another delight).<br /><br />UPDATE: At the time I originally reviewed this product, they offered organic and non-organic versions.  I'm glad to see that they only offer the organic canola oil now.
