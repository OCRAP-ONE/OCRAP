review/summary: Most awesome tasting Energy Chews we have found!
review/text: We do a lot of bicycle riding in the heat and longer rides as well. We don't want to crash from lack of carbs in our system. Other energy products don't taste as good as these do. They are conveniently packed in little pouches so they are easy to grab and take along when we ride. Good stuff!

review/summary: Skip this if you don't want to Bonk!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Stinger products. However, these little gummy gels do nothing as compared to the Stinger Honey Packs. If you are a road or mountain biker and need a good burst of quick energy to keep from bonking on that last hill, these will not help. In fact, the only benefit that I (or any of my riding buddies) have found is that they make your mouth water. Conceivably, this could help with water consumption when riding through the desert (Moab, Fruita). It is my guess that these are not intended for exercising. Maybe, people just use them at work to keep from eating Starburst or something less healthy?!

review/summary: Good For Hiking
review/text: Heard about these from a triathlete who said that they worked fast.  An avid hiker, I have used other energy gels with limited success.  Taken about 15 minutes before an uphill climb, they provide the extra boost you need.  The chews have a great texture and taste like gummi bear candy.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: These taste great!  And it's true what other reviewers have said about the consistency being good and them not sticking in your teeth.  However, as an energy boost for running, they don't do a thing for me.  In fact, they actually cause a stitch.  So I just eat them whenever I feel I need a sugary 'fix'.

review/text: I'm not a fan of messy gels, or stopping for PowerAde during a race. When I do my own long runs or if I'm doing a half, mess and inconvenience factor aside I also don't want to consume junk. These are organic and contain honey, and while soft & squishy somehow don't get stuck to each other when shoved in a gel pocket during a run. The taste is so delicious that my son tries to swipe them as well!

review/summary: Great for Marathon Training
review/text: I'm training for my first marathon in November 2011 and these chews have kept me going during my long 18 to 20 mile training runs.  I dissolve them in water rather than carry them as chews and sip steadily after mile 8.  They taste like concentrated hawaiian punch and do not upset my stomach whatsoever.  I also eat them prior to a workout if I am feeling low energy and will even snack on them in lieu of candy.  Seriously, they are that good.  I have tried GU as well as Powerbar gels and both do the trick but are nowhere near as tasty.  The consistency of the chews are slightly softer than DOTs candy.

review/summary: Great tasting with help keeping energy up.
review/text: I was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running.  I am 60 years old and about 50 pounds overweight.  I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still, everything is organic which I suppose should add to it's value.  I found that I felt no energy boost during my activities but I can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going.  It's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going.  I don't like feeling like I'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that.  I think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising.  The only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them.  I will purchase again when my grocery money allows.  I would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy pickup to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost.

Of the many brands I tried, most all were roughly the same in taste, texture, etc.  But these Honey Stingers stood out to me.  They have a much smoother texture, and have a great sweetness to them that really makes them taste great.  I'm a huge fan... gonna by a bunch more boxes for snacks and workouts.

review/text: When I opened the package, I only found 11 packets of the Honey Stingers. There should have been 12. I counted and re-counted 4 times to be sure. The packets were in a thin cardboard display box, wrapped in a sealed plastic bag, and shipped in a sturdy cardboard box. I don't really want to go through the hassle of returning the item, so I guess I'm out a pack.  It'd be nice if amazon shipped me one more packet! ;-)

review/summary: Honey Stingers....the perfect natural energy
review/text: These are the most awesome little energy snack possible!  Brought a box of these on a hunt for a week with some buddies for the first time...along with a box of Sharkies. Prior to this, Sharkies where our mainstay when needing a boost and energy replacement.  Have to say, even the Sharkies fan in the group had to admit Honey Stingers fairly surpassed Sharkies in both taste and performance.  Will still probably bring both next time for variety, but definitely twice as many Honey Stingers.  Honey IS the perfect food!

review/summary: My Choicest Black Tea
review/text: This is my favorite tea to drink. I am a big fan of Yunnan black teas, so this fits my palate nicely.<br /><br />I love the smell of this tea. It's earthy with notes of cocoa and malt. There is also a honey-like sweetness to the nose.<br /><br />The taste is excellent: the malty and cocoa notes are quite obvious, but they are present after that honey-sweet earthiness mentioned before. One of my favorite things about this tea is that there is little to no bitterness at all (Personally, I have found that 3-4 minutes at 195 degrees is a good temperature that brings out flavor without causing bitterness).<br /><br />The second cup is just like the first, except the honey and malt take a backseat to the cocoa and earthiness. This tea doesn't get noticeably weak to me until the 4th+ steeping. However, it is not a hugely apparent loss of flavor. In short, you'll get many infusions with this one.<br /><br />Don't let the price scare you away -- anyone who has tried many Yunnan teas knows the difference in quality with price. For this particular concoction, $15/2 oz. is a reasonable buy. I use three pearls per 8 oz. water, and I haven't used mine up in weeks! Go buy this stuff and enjoy.

review/summary: Didn't do much for my Teflon stomach
review/text: First, I should say that I ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVSVO">Triple Leaf Tea, Tea Bags, Super Slimming, 1.4-Ounce Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and was sent this item instead. The shipment was fulfilled by Amazon and is correctly labeled, so that was Amazon's shortcoming, not the seller. Be prepared to receive the wrong tea. I realized it when I logged in to write a review about how this product doesn't really work for me.<br /><br />I have a very strong stomach. I eat the spiciest of foods, tons of sugar, anything. I don't get stomach aches. I don't vomit. I don't get diarrhea. A co-worker of mine brought me this cheap tea and told me it was very cleansing. I was dieting and was looking for a good detox. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OLA0EO">Diet Ginseng Slim Tea for Weight Loss, Extra Strength, 3g X 18bags (1.90 Oz) (Pack of 2)</a>) This tea worked for others in the office in 4 hours. It took 8 hours for me. OMG. The Ginseng tea is VERY AGGRESSIVE. It was like vomitting from the other end- totally involuntary.  The Ultra Slim shares two ingredients with the other tea, but the Korean Ginseng is not one of them. I think this is why this tea doesn't work. Also, the herbs may not be a very good grade.<br /><br />I was very disappointed, unbeknownst to me that I had received the wrong product. The tea made me a li'l gassy, but that was all. No movement whatsoever. And what's worse, it tastes JUST like the one that DOES work, like wet, dirty socks.<br /><br />I do like that the bags are individually wrapped and the product is made in the USA. Each box of tea comes shrink wrapped separately if you wish to give them as gifts or buy as a group and split cost. Inside each box is a list of Triple Leaf's Entire line of products along with their ingredients and uses.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this product again.

I should have just went with another company in the first place because it took approximately two weeks just to receive the shipment.

I have no regret buying it, except for the fact I can't get enough!  I blended it with some mandarin oranges, olive oil, cilantro, and an Agave nectar stick . . . . . YUM. Great on baby lettuce with goat cheese, dried cranberries, crushed walnuts and mandarin oranges slices on top!! I also made a chicken wardolf salad with a tablespoon of the above dressing added to some mayonnaise. Find a store near you.<br />***Note - This vinegar is $2.99 in TraderJoe's.

review/text: When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert "3-4 mm" to inches and consequently discovered the "Coarse Grinder Salt" was almost 1/4" (1/6" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!

review/text: This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a "rounded" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.

review/summary: For more than salting foods.
review/text: Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron.

review/summary: Excellent Flavor
review/text: This is the first time I have used land mined salt.  I usually use salt from various sea sources.  After reading several reviews here on Amazon I decided to try this salt.  I was very pleasantly surprised the first time I tasted the salt. The flavor was fresh and subtle.  Not like the salt you usually buy in the grocery stores. Plus it has a lot of trace minerals your body needs.  I highly recommend this salt.

review/text: The product has far fewer pink crystals than shown in the picture, which is perfectly fine with me.  The salt is coarse, excellent for salt mills.  It tastes great and the size is what I wanted and haven't been able to find elsewhere.  The price and service is excellent, as well.

review/summary: the only salt I use--except herbamare and trocomare
review/text: I have not purchased this from Amazon yet as still on what I purchased elsewhere BUT I noticed many people buying the one pound bag. Just to let you know: one kilo equals 2.2 lbs. Why would you buy the one pound bag on something that never goes bad when you can get more than double for just a few dollars more.<br /><br />Dr. Mercola's comments regarding Himalaya salt benefits are what started me using this initially a few years ago. Many micronutrients, great purity. One person questioned the iodine: no salt naturally contains iodine unless it is iodized or contains some sort of seaweed. You can easily see his comments at mercola.com.<br /><br />Himalaya salt has a very 'clean' taste--add at the end of cooking.

review/text: I'll certainly be a repeat customer. I had a tough time finding large salt crystals to refill a grinder, but this fit the bill nicely.<br /><br />Flavor is clean with slight minerality. The color is not a deep as some other himalayan pink I've seen, but it's a very good finishing salt, and a good conversation piece when put on the table in a clear grinder.<br /><br />Also, the seller included a coupon for a future purchase in the package, which was a nice bonus.

review/summary: Great taste!
review/text: This salt is so tasty!  It tastes nothing like the iodized table salt.  This has a light, mild taste that greatly enhances meats, vegetables, etc.  It's pink/peach color also looks very pretty in my clear Cole/Mason grinder.  It grinds very finely with no issue.  In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.  If you're a neat freak, this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder.  Great salt and the bag lasts a long time.

review/text: Just like in the store for a fraction of the price. I purchased this to refill my expensive pink salt grinder. A million times better than table salt. I don't know if it tastes any different from regular table salt but I think there is something about the shape of the crystals that changes the way the salt hits your tongue. If you have a good grinder I highly recommend checking this stuff out.

review/text: Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon).

review/summary: SALT OF THE EARTH - Himalayan Style
review/text: Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.  So now, it's like buying a red, Ford Mustang.  It's all you see on the road or, in this case, on the shelves of the stores.<br /><br />I'm actually glad I purchased this and have stopped using regular old white salt almost totally.  The salt does seem to have a milder taste but I don't find myself using any more of it than I did with the good old "when it rains it pours" variety.<br /><br />Since ordering this from Amazon, I've managed to find some here in my little town but it is way expensive.  When you purchase this you will also need a salt grinder unless you like throwing big chunks of salt at your food.  Worth getting the two together, however, especially if you purchase a grinder with a glass container as the salt really looks attractive in a pretty, transparent grinder.  And, of course, it tastes good, too.  About it's nutritional value I admit to knowing zip.  Does salt HAVE nutritional value?  In the meantime, I give this four stars.  If I find out more about the actual food value I'll update this review.

review/text: I bought two bags of this along with some beef broth from the same company.  Despite the negative reviews from a couple of folks here that it has MSG, and that it also contains chicken broth (really??....Duh!), I highly recommend this powder for its excellent value and rich taste.  Since it comes in a powdered form it is much easier to personalize to your taste.  It also contains a little less sodium than cubed bouillon.  (For anyone that cares about that sort of thing). I don't make chicken soup every day, and hardly ever during the summer months.  So when I do I want it to taste really yummy.  And that means using the best tasting stock I can find.  Unless you are someone that is either sensitive to MSG, or just chooses to avoid it, I highly recommend this chicken powder. Trust me, I think you will like it....Bon Appetite!

I'm neither vegan nor anti-msg, and was actually looking for a real chicken broth powder.<br /><br />At [...] , their own website, the picture of the product shows a different ingredient list than the description. Chicken fat, MSG are shown while they explicitly advertise vegan and NO MSG.  I was hoping that they did not intend to mislead, with either the photo or description was for an older version. I emailed them multiple times over the last few weeks (literally resending my questions over and over), without a single reply.  All I wanted was a final answer as to the ingredients! Not much to ask before I consume a food product of theirs.<br /><br />As I have not received any reply, I can assume they do not care, are intentionally misleading, or do not ever read customer emails. None of these is acceptable. It's a shame because I had planned on buying alot of dried vegetable products, but cannot support such shoddy company behavior.

Unless its ACTING like MSG then why put it in? It would be a better product with out it.

Much to my dismay, I turned each bag over to discover that they are vegan AND contain HVP or HPP (MSG).  I wasn't looking for vegan and I certainly don't want MSG.  Too bad the "detail" pages for these products don't contain the ingredients or I never would have ordered them.  Glad I only got 1 of each to try out.  Apparently I should have gone to the vendors web site to check for ingredients first.  Aside from that, it took about 3 weeks for this to arrive.  I guess I'm just spoiled by quick service elsewhere.  I won't be ordering from these folks again.

review/summary: KING OF THE CHOCOLATES
review/text: If you like chocolate you'll love  Koeze's.  Their chocolate is flavorful and rich whether it's the dark or milk chocolate.  These candies deserve to be called gourmet as they're several cuts above others we've tasted.<br /><br /> Our favorites are the Chocolate Pecan Puddles (called "turtles" by some manufacturers).  The caramel is buttery while the nuts are large and taste fresh.  Our household's likes are evenly divided between dark and milk chocolate so we like to order the mixed container.<br /><br /> Kudos to Koeze's!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke

review/summary: Another Bias Review
review/text: What can you possibly dislike about Puddles? Koeze's puddles are by far the most amazing puddle/turtle/bear-claw candy out there. End of story!<br /><br />Puddles are a holiday tradition in my husband's family. After a few years of rationing the small jar through January, I ordered my own box.  We've now moved on to the larger jar of milk and dark... with a few random orders throughout the year ;)  The caramel is sooo soft and delicious, the nuts are perfect, and the chocolate is a nice quality. I've never met a person who disliked puddles. The price and almost exclusively online availability aren't necessarily a selling point, but those two factors may be the only thing stopping me form living on Puddles for the rest of my life or moving into the Koeze's parking lot.  If you think I'm joking than you've obviously never eaten a Puddle.<br /><br />They can be hard to find closer to Christmas; just about everyone sells out by the 15th of December. The price is fairly consistent and most sites ship from Koeze's directly.  Order early and stock up!

review/text: My local grocery store used to carry these cookies, but stopped.  When I saw that they were available through Amazon for about the same as I had been paying, I decided to give it a try, even though it meant I had to buy 4 packs at once (not sure I can eat THAT many cookies!).  Anyway, since they were coming from England, it obviously was going to take a bit of time.  What a nice surprise when they showed up a week sooner than expected, each sleeve of cookies wrapped in bubblewrap (they are very fragile), with the added bonus of a local English newspaper using as packing material - fun reading material!

review/summary: Chocolate Tea!
review/text: I've only recently begun to branch out in my tea selections from fruity teas to dessert teas.  I don't like sweeteners in my tea, and I was afraid that teas that were meant to taste like desserts would have to taste as if they were sweetened.  Thankfully I was wrong!  I've now tried several of Adagio's dessert teas and they are wonderful- chocolate is one of the best.  The flavor of this tea is strong, and it tastes unmistakably of chocolate.  But thankfully, somehow, it does not taste as thought it is has been sweetened with sugar.  It's amazing- I have no idea how Adagio manages it, but the taste is smooth, rich, creamy chocolate, just not sugary.  This works beautifully as an after-dinner tea, and it fulfills my need for dessert after dinner (well, most of the time).  I think it is excellent with a splash of milk.  I didn't really know what to expect from this tea flavor-wise, but I am very, very pleased. This is a high quality loose tea.  It always brews a nice cup for me. I'll certainly be buying more.

review/text: I bought these caramels because I needed a treat that is individually wrapped (they stand along side Jolly Ranchers and Starbursts!)  They taste great; creamy and delicious.  If caramels run into a problem it's generally that they're too hard and chewy.  Not these caramels!  Not sure what else can be said about their actual taste.  All is as it should be.<br /><br />Each caramel is approximately 3/4" x 3/4" x 1/2" and the entire 5 pound bag displaces approximately 1.5 gallons of space.<br /><br />They arrived in a rectangle flat box sealed in a plastic bag with a label that has a bar code (X0003AQ51L) and the text "Caramel Squares 5lb" and "New", though no date... This is the reason for the one star deduction as I believe nutritional info, ingredients, born on/exp date should have been provided.<br /><br />Seems a good product, a pity the seller didn't do more to stand beside it.

I got them to give my survival students as a little treat and boost.  I have had better in Africa but these are second best. Although these have some toffee constancy they taste like real caramel.  Trust me, I know my caramel so well that when I urinate on a camp fire it smells like caramel.  They do melt easily but I have yet to use them for apples or other recipes.  If you know of any good ones let me know.

review/summary: Incredible, but...
review/text: This is one superb chocolate, but primarily for the more sophisticated chocolate lover. It is intense, rich, smooth, and fills the mouth with its dense flavor the way a good, full-bodied red wine does, but those who eat primarily milk chocolate will probably find Eclipse inedible. An analogy might be someone who loves beer, but primarily drinks Budweiser or Corona, having his first sip of Guinness or Anchor Porter. For those who might find Eclipse too bitter, try working your way up to it over time by eating Dagoba's milk chocolate (the best milk chocolate I've ever had), 59% chocolate, and 74% bars first. All are delicious but not as "intimidating" as the Eclipse bar.

review/text: This is my favourite of all the stonewall cheese ball mixes. It is so savory and delicious. I find all of these stonewall kitchen cheese ball mixes are best served with crackers though, not chips...but that's just me. I find there is enough mix in the package of the sweet pepper flavour to use 2 (8-oz) blocks of cream cheese instead of one. I also do it a bit differently if I'm in a hurry...just add packet #1 to room temperature cream cheese, mix well and scrape into a bowl and smoothe it down then sprinkle packet #2 on top. You don't have to use all, just enough to cover it nicely. You can stick it in the fridge for about half hour if you want, but I don't bother. Just serve. YUM YUM YUM.<br />The Roasted Garlic Onion flavour is also good, and so is the Garden Vegetable. But if you like savory, the sweet pepper one is the way to go.

review/summary: Great Way To Sample Blue
review/text: This is the genuine article Johnnie Walker Blue Label, packaged in a smaller, more affordable, 200mL bottle. On a per drink price, this is a more expensive way to buy Blue. If the price of admission for a 750mL or 1L bottle is too high or risky, this small size is a good deal for a first taste.<br /><br />Johnnie Walker Blue Label became my favorite Scotch whisky a few years ago when a good friend brought me a bottle as a gift for a party I threw (yes he is a great friend). I was a single malt fanatic, Lagavulin was my preferred Scotch, and I basically would drink nothing but single malt.<br /><br />Blue Label has changed my mind about blended Scotch. Right now, I would rather save my money for a bottle of this incredible drink, than squander it on other Whiskies.<br /><br />This is an incredibly smooth Scotch. There is a light smoke flavor, but the biggest notes are fruit, oak, and spices. There is nothing better than a glass of this, a fine cigar (Opus X), and good company. Not to push snobbery or useless glassware for this drink, but it does improve with a medium sized round glass. There's no need to go crazy with a huge brandy fish bowl, but a nice Riedel red wine stemless glass is just great.<br /><br />There is nothing in the world wrong with adding an ice cube to this whisky (I know purists will hate trying this). The interesting thing about ice, the first few sips are nice and smoky. As the ice melts and adds some water to the Scotch (adding a small amount of water to Scotch is an accepted way to bring out different flavors), the smoke flavor softens and other flavors come out. Then as the drink gets cold, the smoke comes back. Ice adds an interesting change to this beautiful drink - it doesn't just dilute. After all, this is your bottle of Scotch and can do what you will with it.<br /><br />Every single person I've ever shared this with has loved it. At one time Johnnie Walker had the most amazing sampler box - 200mL each of Black, Gold (sometimes Green), Single, and Blue. If you ever find that sampler, it is the best value around. This is the perfect method to compare four of the better blended Scotches made - each with their own unique character. Without fail, the fourth bottle in the tasting, Blue, is always gone by the end of the evening. Tasting is a strange word to use; it's more three people sitting around enjoying Scotch. Johnnie Walker Collection 800ML<br /><br />Cardhu is the single malt that makes up the backbone of most of the Johnnie Walker blends.<br /><br />A way to try this Scotch is to watch for Johnnie Walker events. They hold free tasting events in major cities across the country. Their website has details and a schedule.<br /><br />Is this Scotch worth the huge premium? I've tried a lot of amazing expensive and not so expensive spirits, and I say this is worth every single penny. It is the bottle I pour when something good happens and I want to celebrate, or the bottle I open when things don't go so well and I need to lift my mood. It is an incredible drink; I like to call nectar of the gods.<br /><br />There's another unique Sctoch made by Johnnie Walker, Swing. Swing is kind of hard to find, it is about half the price of Blue. It is a super smooth Scotch that's I've started to really like a lot. It's been nice in the middle of winter. Check it out if you have a chance: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HQTEYU">Johnnie Walker Scotch Swing 750ML</a>.

This is a sauce where even chile novices could get some use out of, in small amounts.<br /><br />And like all HBD products, it has a fantastic flavor.  I love this sauce on chicken and rice.  It's also equally great on a burrito, or whatever you want to put it on really.<br /><br />The flavor of this sauce is on par with the other HBD sauces I have had, which in short means the flavor of this hot sauce is as good as it gets.<br /><br />In short, the only thing keeping this out of my top 5 and possibly even my #1 favorite ever is the other HBD sauces I like better only because they are hotter.

review/summary: Not so good...
review/text: I'm a fan and repeat customer for Leonard Mountain soup mixes, but I was very disappointed with the Minestrone Italian Soup.  It was awful.  I started by gently sauteing onions, celery and carrots in a little olive oil.  Even that base didn't help.  I don't like to waste food, but actually dumped this soup down the garbage disposal. And I do love minestrone soup from Olive Garden, Progresso, as well as my homemade versions.

review/summary: This is great cheese sauce!
review/text: I bought this cheese to make nachos, chili-cheese fries, philly cheese-steaks, etc.  It's delicious!  Mine came in 2-106 ounce cans.  It's a lot of cheese, and will last me for awhile.  The jalapeno flavor is very mild to unnoticeable.  I heat mine up in a pan on the stove.  It's easy to prepare and very versatile.  I love it!

review/summary: AMAZING!!!!  Definitely deserving of all 5 stars!!!  One of my fave's!!
review/text: This is literally gold in a cup.  Harney & Sons are GENIUS when it comes to mixing flavors in tea.  This has a taste of green apple in it and the aroma is amazing!  Very flavorful chamomile from the first sip to the end.  You don't need sugar in this one.<br /><br />My other favorite is the Hot Cinammon Spice Tea they make.

review/summary: Our favorite tea
review/text: I first tried this tea at Einstein Bros. Bagels, and it is the only tea the we drink now. It has the greatest flavor, and is the finest tea that I have ever tasted. I have offered it to many friends that do not like tea and they have tried it and loved it. We all like it without cream or sugar, the flavors are so rich and vibrant that it easily stands on its own.<br />Harney & Sons even somehow got my boyfriend off of soda, he bought a bunch of different flavors and has them with his meals instead now. They compliment meals very well, and are a wonderful way to start your day and unwind in the evenings.

review/summary: delicious and calming
review/text: The tea is one of the best mass market teas I've purchased - most mass brand teas taste bland or overly flavored (processed).  This camomile tea tastes smooth and rich;  and you can really see the flowers through the triangular shaped bag.  I am planning to buy more and will likely try more Harney & Son's teas.

review/summary: Excellent chamomile tea
review/text: Really excellent tea, flowers are visible in the bag so I know it's the real thing.  The tin is beautiful! My husband loves chamomile tea before bed, and this is a good one.  Will definitely buy again.
