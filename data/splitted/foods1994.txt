review/summary: Taco Bell
review/text: I truly like Mexican food and flavors so I thought this sauce would be great, boy was I fooled. I did not like it. We would try it on salads, tacos and chips to no avail it was bad. This sauce is very hot that was nice, I think  the combination of other ingredients  that has been mixed into the sauce is a bad mix. Eat this at your own risk. I will not eat it again.

review/summary: Creamy and tangy - a good topping or side sauce
review/text: The easiest way to describe this product -- "it's a salad dressing". That will give you an idea of the consistency and flavor. It has a very "ranch" flavor to it, with the hidden heat of jalapeno.<br /><br />It looks appetizing and tastes good. It has a slight green color that might put some people off, but if you can get past the color, the flavor is quite good. However, a 2-tablespoon serving tops in at around 110 calories -- again, about the same as many high-calorie salad dressings. The sodium content is also a high 310 mg and fat is 11g, so if "healthy" is on your mind, you may want to avoid this or use it lightly.<br /><br />Good uses for this product include toppings for tacos, a side-dip for tortilla chips, and a dressing for a mexican-themed salad. You could also probably add it into other types of salads (potato and macaroni, for example) to add a different flavor and some kick.<br /><br />It's worth trying, but only good in small amounts.

review/summary: Tangy and Creamy, But Hot or Bold?
review/text: I can do little but add my two cents to reaffirm what others have already said: for a jalepeno sauce, this was neither hot nor "bold" as advertised. The best way I can describe it is a creamy sauce that tastes almost like a guacamole that has a bit of the flavor (but not the spice) of a pickled jalepeno. I actually think the sauce is quite flavorful and would be good on a taco (particularly with white meat like fish or chicken). But I am a little bit disappointed that a sauce billed as hot and bold was not... hot or bold. So, three stars for flavor, because it is a good sauce, but subtract two stars for failing to live up to the idea of a Jalepeno Sauce.

review/summary: A different touch to my Taco
review/text: My wife makes tacos about once a week and I have almost always used a typical red sauce type taco sauce (usually Ortega or even sometimes the Taco Bell one if we can find it).  I received a bottle of the Taco bell Jalapeno sauce to try which I figured would spruce up my weekly Taco intake.  I added a touch to my tacos just in case I didn't like it.  Overall, it adds a bit of creaminess to the taco and had a very nice taste.  It is not hot for a jalapeno sauce.  I ended up making nachos the next day with some of the leftover taco beef I had and added the sauce to the mix before I cooked them.  I did not like the way they came out.  This sauce is definitely better as an add on rather than something to cook with.<br /><br />It's an Ok sauce (hence my star rating) but I won't be using this as my regular taco sauce as I still prefer the red typical sauce I had been using.  This will be used to change things up a bit when I am tired of eating my usual taco.  I have also recieved the chipotle Taco Bell sauce but, as of the time of this writing, I have not tried it yet.

review/summary: Big hit with the whole family
review/text: Since it is named Taco Bell, I expected this to be about on the heat level of Heinz 57 sauce.  Was I surprised! There's a decent kick to this stuff (and you can always add hot salsa if it isn't hot enough) yet it doesn't dominate the taste of whatever you put it on.  It's a bit too thick to be a good salad dressing, but it's great as a taco or burrito sauce, veggie dip, sandwich spread, burger topping or even on hot dogs.  Kids, husband and I all love it.  Will get again!

review/summary: green cheese
review/text: avocado in color i expected as much in taste, and i was not disappointed.  afterwards, reading the ingredients on the label i did not see avocado.  maybe I was tasting the soy oil.  cheddar cheese is listed, and on subsequent tastings i did taste the cheese.  lana did not taste cheese, though she admitted to a vegetable flavor.  the jalapeno flavor comes through without too much bite, both lana and i agree on this.  i did not shake the bottle as i used the sauce.  the peppers settle at the bottom of the bottle so my suggestion is do not shake the bottle if you enjoy a spicer, that is, a hotter, sauce.<br /><br />i am not a fan of tacos, however i do enjoy a good sauce, and i seasoned several dishes from vegetables to pork chops and was never disappointed.  this is a sauce i highly recommend.<br /><br />a favorite dish.  broiled salmon, covered in olive oil and sprinkled with powdered red pepper.  cook until the fish is slightly browned.  remove from oven and pour on the bold and creamy jalapeno sauce.  serve with mixed vegetables, and a glass of zinfandel.

review/summary: GOLDILOCKS HOT!
review/text: I like to think I'am a hot aficionado. I've been in hot chili pepper eating contests and I'am constantly checking out different peppers & hot sauces. So, when I came across Taco Bell's Jalapeno Sauce, I picked it right up.<br /> I originally tried it on a taco and the 'hot tang' was 'just right' to suit my taste. Now, I mix it with other sauces & creams to taste. I use it on my hamburgers as well. I mix a little with my French Onion Dip also. In short, when something requires a little extra in the 'hot' sense, I mix it or apply it straight, according to taste.<br /><br /> In conclusion, If your also one of "The Some Like It Hot Crowd" ...check it out.

review/summary: Love it,
review/text: I like the fact that since I do not eat at Taco Bell so often I get the opportunity to try their jalapeno sauce on things other than mexican food.  I love just about all things spicy and this has a nice taste to it, nothing too soft or overbearing, but just right for a sandwhich or wrap.  The sauce itself is thick like mayo and some mustards.  I have used it separately and combined with other condiments and have enjoyed it.

The flavor of this sauce is not bad, but there's nothing special about it either.  Of all the competing sauces available, this Taco Bell sauce would be rank similar to processed cheese slices--it has it's place but is probably not a key component in a special meal.

review/summary: Not bad, but also not hot and not memorable
review/text: I received my bottle of Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review of the product.<br /><br />I love hot spicy foods, and I love Taco Bell for the occasional fast food treat.  So I was pleased to see this item offered for review.  The day it arrived, I fixed tacos for dinner, and mixed a little of this sauce in the meat mixture.  My family said it tasted like ranch dressing, but slightly spicier.  I found it to be sort of like Green Goddess salad dressing, which is buttermilk based with a cucumber taste.  I kept hoping it would deliver some heat, but it is very mild.<br /><br />Tonight I tried a little on my spinach salad, and it was pretty good.  Still not hot in any way, but tasty enough.  I'm disappointed that this product isn't spicier, but I suppose it's formulated for the average American palate.<br /><br />I might buy it again, but probably not.  We use mainly homemade Italian dressing, and unless they offer this in a spicier version I'll stick to sprinkling Tabasco or cayenne pepper on my food.

review/text: According to the label this product is "A perfect finishing touch for your tacos, Mexican salads and sandwich wraps". Cool, although I do not make a habit of keeping tacos and sandwich wraps hanging around the house, and if I'm having a Mexican salad someone else is going to be making it for me :)<br /><br />I do like to have a spicy dipping something or other around for my ever-so-boring turkey and I usually use a kicked up mustard like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EY5TA8">Beaver Brand Sweet Hot Mustard</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EY7PA0">Beaver Brand Jalapeno Mustard</a> so when this popped up on Vine I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />The verdict? Not bad at all and rather warm, although not as warm as the wasabi mayonnaise I get from the specialty store with the initials TJ (do try that on a sandwich). It worked well enough as a condiment to my main entree, albeit with a slightly oily texture (I think I'll stick with the mustards). The bottle itself is very easy to hold and an easy flip open, squeeze top. I don't much care for the red background/black print on the back of the label, the ingredient list is rather difficult to read for us older readers.

review/summary: Not Bad--Better Than I Expected
review/text: If Mexican cheese dip married salad dressing and had a baby, this might be the result. I first tried it as a dip for tortilla chips. It was a hit, and I suspect it'll go best with Mexican dishes. I also tried it as a salad dressing for a spinach salad. It was okay, not great. I'm looking forward to trying it as a sauce for bean and cheese burritos or tacos.<br /><br />It's got more ingredients than I like, but fairly typical for a product like this. Because of this, I wouldn't make it a daily diet item.

review/summary: OK but prefer the Taco Spicey Ranchero
review/text: I like the taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce OK, but I found the Taco Bell Spicey Ranchero, which I previously reviewed, to be more spicey and flavorful than the Taco Jalapeno Sauce.  The Jalapeno Sauce does have a taste of Jalapeno, but there is something about it that falls somewhat short in my opinion.  I cannot be more exact as to why.  Perhaps it needs more Jalapeno.  Anyway, even though I like Jalapeno flavor, in this case I found the Spicey Ranchero more flavorful.  Go figure.

review/text: I was hoping for a sharp taste of jalapeno in this sauce, but didn't find it.  For me, it wasn't terribly different from something called "Green Goddess dressing".  I tried this Jalepeno Sauce on tacos and as a chip dip, and even on some rice, but wasn't impressed enough to want to buy it again.  It really is best used as a salad dressing.  I think Taco Bell should make it spicier, and it would be a much more interesting sauce.

review/summary: hot sauce
review/text: Not knowing what to expect, it was difficult to determine where to use the Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce. I tried it on a combination vegetable dish which was stir fried. The stir fry included zuccini, potatoes, beans, green peppers, chives, broccoli and a little bacon. (all fresh from the garden except of course the bacon) I poured a little sauce on the mixture on my plate and loved it. My wife who does not care for hot spicy food didn't care for it. I would rate the heat at about a medium for taco sauces. It should be good on chicken tacos and other Mexican dishes. It has good flavor, a bit of heat and a creamy texture. It also appears to be free of MSG, Trans-fat and corn syrup. I wish someone would make a sauce with less dyes, etc. though. I recommend this sauce and plan to purchase it again.

review/text: This sauce is just not hot enough for my tastes.  FYI, I eat quite a lot of jalapenos, both pickled and raw.  I was looking forward to this sauce, but it was simply not spicy enough for me.  The flavor is similar to the sauce Taco Bell used for their flatbread sandwiches they offered a while back.  There is a slight hint more jalapeno flavor than the flatbread sauce, but texturally and flavor-wise it is almost the same.  I believe this sauce is in the perfect wheelhouse for someone that does not like overly spicy food.  For people that like their faces to turn beet red and steam to come out of their ears while eating, look elsewhere.

review/text: Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce is a creamy dressing for salad or tacos. It is a thick dressing, medium hot, with a slight egg & strong mayo-salt flavor. 100 out of 110 calories come from fat-so this is not health food.  I think it is tasty, but not delicious. However, it should go well with taco's if not over applied. Of course, IMO adding your own fresh Jalapeno's and fresh sour cream to your taco will taste much better then using this dressing.<br /><br />It is doubtful, I would buy it with all the many (better & more healthy) alternative dressings on the market.

review/summary: 4.25 stars: Tangy, savory, creamy, salty & a bit spicy
review/text: Zingy, rich and with a hint of heat, Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce will be a great accompaniment to lots of foods.  It would be great on tacos or taco salads, a dip for chips, on a baked potato, spread on wraps or sandwiches, drizzled over a grilled flat iron steak, on chicken fingers or wings.  Anything you'd do with ranch dressing you could use this for.  I tested it on crispy fries with chili powder type spices and it was excellent.  The flavor, texture and consistency is like you took your favorite ranch dressing and blended it with pickled jalapeno rings and something tangy.  Its not the grassy heat flavor of fresh jalapenos.  If the only jalapenos you've ever had were rings from a jar, then that is the flavor I mean by pickled and the one I prefer personally.  It's noticeably salty, but I like a bit more salt so that doesn't offend me.<br /><br />This is so subjective, but I would say that the heat level is mild.  I noticed a lot of reviewers complained that it's not 'bold' enough and they expected more heat.  The label says 'bold & creamy' and that's how I would describe the flavor also, but not the heat level.  A little goes a long way because of the strong, kicky flavor and the richness.  Taco Bell has to appeal to a large, middle of the road audience and most people don't like things that hot.  And besides, I think people who want blow-the-top-of-your-head-off heat know you're not going to find that in Taco Bell restaurants or their super market products.  I don't think there would be too many people who would have a hard time with the heat of this sauce.<br /><br />I usually try to keep to a low-carb diet so I'm always looking for interesting low to no carb dressings for salads with grilled proteins(pretend like I didn't just tell you how I ate this on the evil french fries).  And the only nutrition info I found online said it had zero carbs but it has three per serving.  So here are the nutrition facts for those who are interested:<br /><br />Serving Size: 2 tablespoons (and that's enough imo because it is rich)<br />Calories 110<br />Fat 11 g<br />Sat fat 1.5 g<br />Sodium 310<br />Carb 3 g<br />Fiber 0 g<br />Sugar 1 g

Slight artificial taste, but altogether not bad at all.

review/text: I am a fan of all things spicy, so I was curious to see how this would stand up. The sauce itself isn't that bad - not real thick, not really spicy but good enough to give whatever you're eating a bit of a kick. It's not something that I'd use frequently so I don't know if I'd really feel it necessary to have an 8oz bottle at my disposal. Instead of it being a "must" to pair with with various meats, it was the other way around and feeling that since I had a big bottle of sauce, I figured that I had to try it out with things in the kitchen. It worked out well with tacos and chicken. Overall, not too bad.

review/summary: Versatile product
review/text: Taco Bell "Bold and Creamy" Jalapeno Sauce is a good tasting sauce.  It is quite versatile; it can be used as a topping on foods like tacos, nachos, and Mexican salads, or as a sandwich spread, or as a dipping sauce for pretzels or veggies.  However, it is a bit high in fat, so it's best to use sparingly, especially if using as a salad dressing or dip.  ("Creamy" in a food name/description often means higher in fat.)  Two tablespoons of this sauce contains 11g fat, including 1.5g saturated fat and 0g trans fat, and has 110 calories, 100 of which are fat calories.

review/summary: Better and More Useful Than I Expected
review/text: I wasn't really optimistic about this sauce; I mean, after all--Taco Bell brand? How gourmet can it be? To my surprise, it's pretty good, and it has potential for several different uses; understand I'm speaking as a somewhat opportunistic cook.<br /><br />If you taste it straight, there is a slight artificial taste to it, but this is not noticeable at all when you combine it with other food. We had it as a taco sauce tonight--that seems to be its intended basic use--and it went well; even the Picky Eater I'm married to liked it. It has the spicy part just about right for those of us who want many foods to be a tad on the hot side, but who also want to be able to enjoy the taste of the food more than the heat of the pepper. It's a bit spicier than I thought it would be, but in a good way.<br /><br />I also put some in a small bowl to use as a dip, and that was also quite good. I think next time I will add some finely chopped tomatoes (I have a garden, and it's tomato-plethora time as I write this) and scallions. Experience says it will be good.<br /><br />I think it would make a decent salad dressing, and there I might add some extra peppers, maybe serranos (it's pepper-plethora time, too), and some cilantro--maybe just a tiny shot of olive oil to thin it out a bit.<br /><br />In short, it's one of those items that can stand alone in some things and also make a very useful ingredient. No, it's not an authentic, gourmet, classy sauce; but it can be one of those reliable things that make the lot of the person putting together a meal in a hurry a better one.

review/summary: Jalapeno Sauce
review/text: I have to admit that I like hot and spicy foods and can tolerate a bit of heat so when I tried this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRMG98">Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> sauce I already knew it would not provide the kick I enjoy so that is not a factor in this review.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this sauce did have a nice jalapeno flavor and a creamy texture more akin to salad dressing than to sour creme.  I've used this sauce as a dip on chips as well as on entree foods such as burritos and quesadillas and found it pleasant enough even though there does seem to be a slight thickener feel if too much is applied -- almost like a non-fat salad dressing.<br /><br />For a very mild touch of jalapeno flavor this sauce is fine but it's easily overpowered with highly spiced foods.  The sauce, however, does temper those same spices and creates a nice rich body to whatever you're eating.  One thing that I did find to be a bit off was that the sauce has a sweetness to which I feel is unnecessary.<br /><br />So a mixed bag here but both not unpleasant.<br /><br />You won't get a blast of jalapeno flavor with this condiment but you will get a rich creamy taste with each bite.  I suggest just adding some fresh jalapenos for flavor and heat and enjoy the sauce as a dip or accompaniment with your South-of-the-Border meal.

review/summary: Creamy maybe, but not bold
review/text: The quality "Bold" stated in the title of this jalapeno sauce is a misnomer.  The jalapeno flavor is very mild.  Very, very mild.  And it is even somewhat sweet to boot.<br /><br />The sauce is not thick, therefore, it might do quite nicely as a dip with potato chips as it wouldn't crush or break them.  But you'd have to like the flavor.<br /><br />It would also probably be suitable as a light salad dressing, e.g., lettuce and tomato.  (Re-edited version:  after I posted this, I tried the sauce on just such a light salad, and it did turn out to taste quite pleasant on it.)<br /><br />As for its being right as a taco sauce, as a long-time veteran of tacos living near the Mexican border, I find that claim absurd.  We're a bit more daring with our beloved taco sauces here in the West.<br /><br />As for sandwich wraps, it might do.  Personally, I'd prefer good old mayonnaise or even mustard.<br /><br />Some of the ingredients are:  buttermilk, egg yolk, sugar and salt, with less than two percent of cheddar cheese and red and green bell peppers.  The sodium level seems high at 310 mg., and two tablespoons of the sauce contain 110 calories.  The only vitamin noted is Vitamin A at four percent.<br /><br />Although this sauce is definitely not to my taste, it might appeal to those who like "a little bit of Mexico" on their food, but not too much.<br /><br />Just a little bit!

review/summary: Not for everyday use....
review/text: Taco Bell has a few good items that I like to have but not on an everyday basis in my refrigerator. This is the case with this sauce.The best way I can describe the flavor is a sweetened sour cream with jalapeno flavor. It is a bit warm, but not overbearingly hot. While it is tasty on chips and lettuce, it is not something I would buy again in bottle form to keep around. It's nice once in awhile as a treat, just like Taco Bell meals, but not something I "can't live without". I do think this would be good on some of TB's chicken burritos etc.

review/summary: *gag*
review/text: I wasn't expecting much from a Taco Bell product, but I was at least expecting something edible, with a little heat, that I could offer as a sauce for tacos.  A pretty low bar, right?  But this 'Jalapeno' Sauce doesn't even meet that criteria.<br /><br />First of all: "Bold & Creamy"?  I guess it's creamy, in a gag-inducing way, but there is no bold there.  Perhaps someone passed a jalapeno over the bottle as a flavoring. Maybe.  There is no heat, no kick at all.  Which would be fine; some people don't like kick.  Except they named it Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce.  So....yeah.<br /><br />Even if you accept that this is a mild sauce, it's still gross.  There is buttermilk in it, which gives it a tang, but soybean oil & water are the first two ingredients (of more than 25).  The whole thing just tastes really chemical-y and fake and bad.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  I have teenage boys.  Who run cross country.  They're hungry at dinnertime, and not what you'd call discerning.  And even they wouldn't eat this stuff.

It worked well on all these items, but surprisingly, it was really good on the fries. But I like mayonnaise on my fries, so go figure.<br /><br />If your looking for a ranch type sauce with a little pepper kick then this is for you. If you're looking for a jalapeno sauce to kick you 'in-the-you-know-whats' then try something else.

review/summary: Bold and creamy might be a misnomer
review/text: I received this Jalapeno sauce from the Amazon Vine program for review. Here's my take on it:<br /><br />I'm not a habitue of Taco Bell, preferring to make my food from scratch, so my expectations weren't high for this sauce, especially after trying the orange-y chipotle sauce. That said, I didn't find it as objectionable as many reviewers. It is creamy, in a processed way, and there's definitely a bit of a jalapeno bite, though not strong.<br /><br />I tried it on a few seasoned Doritos and felt the chip seasoning overwhelmed the sauce, which is quite mild. I compared it with the chipotle sauce and feel it is the better tasting of the two. That said, it isn't a sauce I'd put on a taco. I use my home made chipotle crema or a spicy salsa or pico de gallo. It might be good on a wrap in place of mayonnaise and would certainly spice up chopped lettuce. My rating: a 3.5, partly because the sodium is high at 310 and the calories are high as well.

review/text: A great sauce not just for Tacos but salads.  I love Tacos and I am always creating new ways to spice them up.  This definitely will replace my current favorite sour cream, mayonnaise, and taco seasoning mix that I currently use.  The taste I would describe is buttermilk ranch with a bit of a Jalapeno kick.  Not hot or overpowering just a little tang and zest.  Would make a great Mexican style salad dressing or bean dip.  Another family member tried a taste and they described it as a creamy sour cream with Jalapeno zing.  The Jalapeno gives it a flavor that is very unique to whatever you try this on.  Not just for Tacos, but a great dipping sauce for wings or chicken also.  Thank you Taco Bell and Amazon Vine!

review/text: We LOVE Mexican Food, and I love Jalapeno's.  I love the little kick they give to my food, not overly hot, but just enough heat to tingle the taste buds.  We are also big fans of sour cream, love the tang it gives to our tacos, nachos or enchiladas.<br /><br />So, when I saw this I thought this might be a great addition to the table, especially for the kids.  Jalapeno's are a bit spicy for them, but they also like something a bit more.  This was perfect!  Since we only use a little bit, I didn't pay too much attention to the nutritional information.  This is just a condiment, not something you need much of.<br /><br />The price is about right as well-a little goes a long way, though my husband liked to use it as a dip with his chips.  About $2.50 a bottle-not bad!<br /><br />I will be adding this to our fridge as a staple.

It has a bit more of a kick than I expected from a mainstream product, but that's a good thing.  In addition to the spiciness, it's a tad on the sweet side, and while there are jalapenos, and green and red peppers on the ingredients list, it reminded me more of chili powder seasoning - probably because of the sweetness.<br />At he end of the day, this is one product I will likely buy again once the trial sample is gone.

review/text: This Sauce(more like a dressing, since the off-white product has a texture like ranch dressing) has a definite, strong Jalapeno flavor and kick, and though the heat won't burn, you can definitely feel a slight trace of the heat on your tongue,even after you finish consuming it. At first, I tried this sauce with tortilla chips, and, while it can be used like a salsa, the product is packaged in a bottle shaped like a salad dressing bottle, which suggested that I should try it with vegetables, so I tried dipping baby carrots into it, and found that dipping vegetables is an ideal use for this product. I suppose that it could be used as a salad dressing, but in the quantities that you'd have to use to reasonably coat a salad, it might prove to be too powerful.

review/text: If you like the true flavors of Mexican food and the spicy kick of jalape&ntilde;os, then avoid this sauce. The first word of their description was "SPICY" so I jumped at the chance to try it. It was not remotely spicy. We tried the sauce on our tacos (which we do make spicy) and all this served to do was muddle the flavors of the meat and give us an unpleasant aftertaste. I tasted it on its own and it was quite disappointing. There was no jalape&ntilde;o flavor and it tasted like it was full of artificial flavors that had gone bad. We are huge fans of the Tex-Mex restaurant, Chuy's, and they have a creamy jalape&ntilde;o sauce that is the perfect blend of the heat from the peppers and the chill of the cream. Taco Bell's Jalape&ntilde;o sauce had none of that.

review/summary: Not so hot...
review/text: Do your lettuce a favor...don't inflict this dressing on it.  The taste is not fresh, and the texture is kind of slimy. It was too salty for me, and I'm the girl who puts salt on salted potato chips. You actually can taste a little of the jalapeno flavor and there is a bit of heat, but other than that, this is a glorified version of that packaged onion dip we used to gobble up when we were in college...you know, the one that went so well with the Anne Greensprings Berry Frost.<br /><br />I don't know what foods this "sauce" should be poured on or over. It turns a salad into a salty, slimy mess.  I tried it as a dip for carrots, celery and corn chips.  It did not improve any of them. I even schlepped out to the nearest tacqueria and ordered one cabeza and one al pastor.  The lady behind the counter "tsk tsked" me for ignoring her fresh salsa--so full of chopped fresh jalapenos and onion and tomato and cilantro, the smell alone had passersby falling to their knees in silent adoration.  Anyway I dolloped on the Taco Bell sauce, took one bite and apologized to the poor cow who's noggin I was munching for desecrating her sacrifice.  The nice lady behind the counter clonked me on the hand with a very heavy ladle when I tried to pour the Taco Bell stuff on the the al Pastor, so I used her fresh sauce instead. It was so good, I went cross-eyed for about three hours and didn't mind losing the use of my hand for 20 minutes from the mighty blow of her avenging ladle. Besides, now that I think of it, she had forks right there too and could have used one of those.  Anyway, the tacqueria lady's Jalapeno Taco Sauce is the real thing.  Hand made, fresh, chunky vibrant and just plain good.  The Taco Bell stuff is the polar opposite, physically, morally and spiritually. The Taco Lady told me to leave the bottle, and since she was wielding her ladle, I did.  She picked up the bottle with two fingers and disposed of it, presumably where children or small animals could not find it.<br /><br />And for the record, I like a lot of bottled dressings. I'm not a salad dressing snob, I don't require Extra Extra Virgin Olive Oil squeezed between the knees of unsullied maidens, nor do I hunt out balsamic vinegar aged for 1,000 years under the headpieces of Sicilian nuns.  Sure I prefer hand-crafted dressings, as long as somebody else's hands are doing the crafting, but when I'm doing the work, I find Oriental Chef Asian Sesame just fine for salads, and Buttermilk Ranch perfect for dipping celery or carrots (which don't deserve anything better).  And as far as Kraft Cole Slaw dressing is concerned, it's perfect. Mayonnaisy, sweet but not too sweet, just like Momma made, if momma had made cole slaw instead of picking it up from the deli like a normal person.<br /><br />So what would I suggest serving with Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce?  You might give it to your kids to put on a turkey burger if you are the kind of evil degenerate who pretends ground turkey is food and wants Junior to dump you into a nursing home when you grow your first gray hair. In the meantime, I think you should visit a certain taco stand on Sherman Way in Van Nuys. Tell the lady that you want a turker burger taco with miracle whip. Heh heh.

review/text: This slightly creamy sauce has quite a good flavor and you can definitely taste the jalapeno in it. Good news is that it's moderately spicy, so it adds a lot of flavor and some "kick" without overdoing it and making your food so hot you can't taste it. I was pleasantly surprised because I'll admit I wasn't expecting much from a product with the Taco Bell name on it, but it tastes quite good. I've found this sauce quite good for seasoning ground beef for homemade hamburger patties.

Producers seem terrified of the smallest hint of heat, and so even though they add jalapenos and even habaneras, they are added in such low doses that the results are wimpy little sauces at best.<br /><br />Case in point, this "Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce."  If there are jalapenos in here, I couldn't find them.  More of a "hint of jalapenos," to add just the faintest dash of flavor, without any robustness or courage.<br /><br />The flavor isn't bad, just typically bland.  And I couldn't imagine using this as a taco sauce.  This is basically re-named ranch dressing, and who wants to put ranch dressing on their tacos?  I did end up using it as a salad dressing, although I thinned it out with a little milk.<br /><br />I am glad I gave it a shot once, but I won't be buying this again.

review/summary: Bold and Creamy
review/text: I like Taco Bell, so when I saw this available at Amazon.com, as part of there vine program, (for free,) To generate reviews, I thought I would give this chance. I tried it with Chips as an hot sauce to go with some soft tacos I made. And I have to say I like it allot. It tastes like a creamy Jalape&ntilde;o, just like the description. On a scale of heat I would say its a delayed effect an its medium. Its not Hot or Super Hot. I and my family enjoyed it and I would buy it and use it again.

review/summary: Whipped cream, vermouth, sunblock lotion
review/text: I first tried this product, Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce, in a 10-inch tortilla wrap rolled with baby swiss cheese and extra-thin slices of roast beef.  I thought it added fine notes of flavors, and I would use it again for this exact purpose.  I like most of the flavors and textures this sauce brings.<br /><br />PROBLEM<br /><br />But I don't detect much jalape&ntilde;o flavor, which is one of my favorites, and which is why I chose this to begin with.<br /><br />===== Which is why I subtract ONE STAR.<br /><br />SOLUTION<br /><br />Using the nearest blade, I simply chopped up a few slices from a jar of jalape&ntilde;os (using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00093090Y">Victorinox 47547 10-1/4-Inch Wavy Bread Knife, Black Fibrox Handle</a>), dumped them and a little bit of the jar's juice into the bottle, and gave it a pretty sincere shaking.  Voila.<br /><br />I ordered this product rather than some similar one for a secondary purpose, which is to make the following point, which I insist you not only read carefully but also find interesting.<br /><br />As you know, the word jalape&ntilde;os is properly pronounced as follows:<br /><br />hall aah PAY nyos.  But I have heard it pronounced, and you might too, as follows:<br /><br />jal uh PEE nuhz.<br /><br />This is a remarkably poor pronunciation, and I think it might set some sort of record for the greatest density of mistakes.<br /><br />1.  It's h, not j.<br />2.  It's all, not Al.<br />3.  It's aah, not uh.<br />4.  It's pay, not pee.<br />5.  It's ny, not n.<br />6.  It's os, not us.<br />7.  And it's os, not ohz.<br /><br />That's nearly 2 mistakes per syllable, or one every 1.3 letters in only 9 letters.  Can you think of a word that is more severely mispronounced?<br /><br />===== For this I subtract TWO MORE STARS from the product.<br /><br />Although it is not my choice as a substitute for picante sauce on a taco or pretty much any Mexican food, that's just my personal preference.  It does make a striking salad dressing, and it can be used as a base for a dipping sauce for tortillo chips or the like.  And I like a little mixed into mashed potatoes or a topping for a baked potato, but again that's just me.<br /><br />I tried other applications just for this Amazon review, and here are the results.<br /><br />-- Drizzled onto a pumpkin pie<br /><br />This turned out to be just awful.  The flavors of a well-made pumpkin pie are not only not enhanced by the addition of this sauce on top of it, they are positively worsened, especially when compared to the use of a substance such as, say, whipped cream.  If you are thinking of duplicating this test just to make sure I'm not merely making this up, I recommend that you drizzle the sauce onto the top of a single slice and not the whole entire pumpkin pie as I did, just in case you get the same result and wish you hadn't.<br /><br />-- As a substitute for vermouth in a classic straight-up gin martini<br /><br />This result also was ghastly.  Whoever perfected the first classic martini did a good thing for the dlrow of people who like the classic martini, or the fourth one, as the case may be in your time zone.  Whoever thought of using Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce instead of vermouth made, in my opinion, a grievous mistake.  Another griebous mistake is to make a whole batch of martinish this way instead of just one.  Live and learn, though, right?<br /><br />-- Sunblock<br /><br />This is a closer call, so let me list the pros and the cons.  The best argument in favor of using this sauce as a substitute for any of the regular, purpose-made sunblock lotions that are approved by The United States FDA and are available in many convenient stores is that it does work in the sense that whereever you have it slathered on thick enough, it will surely reduce the harmful effects of the sun's ultraviolet-range radiation on your skin, I would think, to some extent or other.  I am not inclined to test the exact SPF value of this sauce under the many exact various circumstances such as Hawaii unless YUM Brands wants to fund the research!<br /><br />As a sunblock Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce does suffer from a number of problems.  One is that it slides off of pretty much any part of you that isn't bowl-shaped or at least flat and horizontal in your particular bodily configuration when it's applied.  For example, if you're lying supine you can pop open the top, which is handily hinged, and squeeze out some of this particular sauce (I have the eight-ounce size) into your navel and have a fair chance it will provide some degree or other of protection to the skin thereunder, assuming you have an innie.<br /><br />Another drawback is that no one -- at least no one I asked over a period of dozens of hours spread out over several weeks at various pools and beaches this summer -- seems to want to help you apply this exact sauce to your back.<br /><br />A third con to this optional sunblock use is that in the hot sun this sauce reeks out a noisome aroma within a three-foot radius that is not only not nearly as pleasant as the reminiscigential smell of suntan lotion, it is decidedly worse than neutral.  In fact, I think I'd rather smell three feet.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but when I balance the pros and the cons I weigh the sunblock cons more heavily.<br /><br />===== So, because of its failure as a substitute for whipped cream and vermouth and sunblock lotion, I subtract YET 1 MORE STAR.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />If you like a little jalape&ntilde;o flavor in this type of sauce, buy this product.  If you like more, you can add it.

review/summary: Tastes okay, small bottle
review/text: I tried this sauce with some friends of mine (along with the Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce) when we got together and made burritos. We all seemed to agree that the sauce tastes fine, but it's probably not worth buying. It was definitely creamy as advertised, but the flavor wasn't very memorable. This sauce tasted a little bit spicier than the Ranchero version. I was hoping for a little bit more, though. The spice level was perhaps comparable to medium salsa.<br /><br />In addition to the rather underwhelming flavor, this sauce comes in an extremely small bottle. It's shaped in a somewhat deceptive manner that maximizes its surface area, but the reality is that the sauce inside will fill a soda can two-thirds of the way to the top. This stuff tastes fine, but there have to be better-tasting sauces out there that are cheaper besides.

review/text: This sauce has a nice spicy zing, just like the other two flavors Taco Bell makes. But it is also very creamy like the other sauces, which for some reason was slightly surprising (but I guess it shouldn't have been). The taste also has a slight garlic or horseradish taste to it, but that could be just me. Overall, these sauces are a great way to makes your tacos and many other things you would put a special sauce on taste very different so I recommend them all.

It's delicious; so, that's what I immediately thought of when I saw this.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is very good - and it's just the right consistency for a chip dip. I love spicy food; so, most people don't trust my "Spicy Meter" - but I didn't think this was spicy at all.<br /><br />When it comes to tacos, I think I'll stick with actual jalapenos and salsa; but, as a dip, this sauce is very good.

review/summary: Great for fish tacos and chicken dishes.
review/text: I had the opportunity to sample and evaluate 3 different flavors of Taco Bell's bottled sauces. These were the Jalapeno, Chipotle and Spicey Ranchero flavors. Of the 3, I personally liked the Jalapeno flavor the most with the Spicey Ranchero coming in a close second. The flavors are bold so a little sauce goes a long way.<br /><br />I approached this evaluation from the standpoint that these sauces are condiments, like ketchup or mustard, and not just sauces that you might put on your tacos and burritos. That said, I tasted each flavor on fish sticks with pleasant results. The only sauce I did NOT like on them was the Chipotle sauce, which I feel might be better suited to dishes that include beef. The Jalapeno and Spicy Ranchero both work really well with fish (and would be great for fish tacos) as well as chicken. Used as a condiment, these sauces can add a new flavor experience to everything from deli sandwiches to casseroles. I added about 2 tbsp of the Spicey Ranchero to a batch of left over rice along with some cheese and a bit of sour cream to make a great side dish. A lot of recipes that call for mayo might be livened up or rejuvenated with a measure of your favorite sauce.

review/summary: Lacking in jalepeno character.  Has a creepy, unnatural light-green color
review/text: The most distinctive qualities of this sauce are its light green color and creaminess. The sauce has a slightly hot flavor, that is, where the hotness is provided by that most famous of spicey molecules, "capsaicin." Capsaicin is what makes peppers naturally not. At any rate, the good folks in Iowa who work tirelessly to put corn and pork on the table, might consider this sauce to be adventuresome or "out there." However, folks from the San Francisco Bay area, where practically every block contains a Thai restaurant, a Chinese restaurant, or a Korean restaurant, will find this sauce to be bland or tame. Thus, although the label reads, "BOLD & CREAMY," it cannot be said that the flavor of this product is "bold." In view of the fact that the product is called, "Jalapeno Sauce," I would expect to find crunchy bits or slivvers of jalapeno peppers or, if not that, crunchy bits or slivvers of ordinary bell peppers. But there are no crunchy things. There are some tiny specks, perhaps measuring having a length of one millimeter. In addition to the hot flavor of this product, it does seem to have the typical flavor of a pepper (this flavor could be classified as bitter, since the flavor is not sweet and not sour). But in my opinion, this bitter flavor should have been a bit stronger. Food chemists have synthesized the pepper flavor molecule (I am not referring here to capsaicin), and I would have appreciated a product with a bit more of this pepper flavor molecule. Also, I would have liked to see a product that is darker green. The sauce is light green -- there are no jalepenos that are colored light green. Jalepenos are only dark green or red. But now, I think I will be more honest. While this "sauce" does have a mild hot flavor, it is notably lacking in any other flavor. The light-green color gives me the creeps.

review/summary: Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce
review/text: While not very "bold" or all that hot (relative to other jalapeno products), I did like this jalapeno sauce.  I tried it on tacos, enchiladas, nachos and taco salad and liked it on all of them, but was not to fond of it as a stand-alone dip with tortilla chips.  I would say it compliments the flavor of what it is on, providing a bit of zip, but doesn't quite cut it as the main flavor (as in use as a dip, or even a plain lettuce salad).  I primarily used it as a substitute for sour cream on most of the foods, including as a baked on glaze instead of sour cream on enchiladas and enjoyed it each time.  I don't know that I would use it every time, but would certainly use it now and then to mix things up.  If you are familiar with the other Taco Bell creamy sauces, I would rate this about the same as their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRKEH4">Chipotle Sauce</a> and better than their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRO1S2">Bold & Creamy, Spicy Ranchero Sauce</a> for my personal tastes.  Not an authentic Mexican food experience, but definitely worth trying again.

review/text: The taste is creamy, much like Arby's Horsey Sauce. It has a distinct jalape&ntilde;o flavor much like Arby's has a horseradish flavor. While there is a distinct hotness, the heat is between mild and medium, depending on how much you use. I tried it on a hamburger sandwich and liked the kick it gave to the overall taste. If you want pure heat, I suggest a regular red pepper hot sauce. If you just want to spice up something, this works.

review/summary: Good for Tuna Salad
review/text: My first thought was that the Taco Bell sauce would be good as a dip. Since my garden is now producing cucumbers at a scary rate, I tried the sauce as a cucumber salad dressing as soon as I opened the bottle. It worked very well. The sauce is smooth, has some sharpness to it, but is not overly spicy. After the cucumber experiment, I placed the opened bottle in the refrigerator. I will try it again as a salad dressing when the tomatoes in the garden turn red, Right now they are still green. They will probably turn all at once, so I will have to figure out ways to consume them.<br /><br />My impression of the Taco Bell sauce after refrigeration was that it has almost the same consistency as mayonnaise, This gave me another idea. I usually make tuna salad by mixing mayonnaise, hot sauce, and a few spices into the tuna. This time I mixed in only the Taco Bell sauce. Incidentally, the sauce has half the calories per tablespoon compared to the mayonnaise. The tuna salad turned out well. It was very similar to my mayonnaise-based version.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by my initial experiments with the sauce. I have tried both the Chipotle and Jalapeno versions. They both work equally well. That is, I find it hard to tell the differences in taste. The one negative is that they contain artificial coloring and flavoring. They lose a star on that account.

review/text: These Taco Bell condiments are pretty good, considering what they are: more-or-less standard, corn syrup-sweetened and preservative-laden sauces that go down easy - not too spicy for most folks, and a tad on the sweet side. Not nearly spicy enough and a bit too sweet for me, though. (However, I will admit to dipping cold grilled chicken in this stuff, and eating it rather gleefully...)

review/text: This is not going to be a review that will go in-depth.  The bottom line is that I love jalapeno anything and this was not 'jalapeno' flavored in the least bit.  The sauce is very creamy and just too bland for my tastes.  DO I love spicy and hot flavored anything?  Yes!  This sauce did not even provide a bit of a kick.  Nothing.  Just creamy awkward tasting blandness.  To add insult to injury Amazon decided to ship me expired products.  Yes... expired.  I took the risk and still tried it but I still found the taste to be bland.  I am hoping that my taste was off because it was not used by the :best if used by date:, because in my opinion it is best if it is never used.<br /><br />Do not recommend and very disappointed in the fact that Amazon sent an expired product to a consumer.  I usually love Taco Bell's little packets and had high hopes for their new creamy/spicy line.  Sadly... I was not impressed.  I will also be reviewing another variety and had the same experience.  That is why the review will be identical this time.  I truly had nothing good to say about either and did not want to waste anymore time.

Watched forks over knives DVD, and especially loved the DVD called FAT, SICK & NEARLY DEAD....Had a heart attack a year ago so really trying to clean up my act. I want to go the way of Dr Esselsyn but I keep back sliding since my health is not yet near any life & death situation. Yet, at age 62 I see why NOW is the time to change! I never had any cholesterol issues either until AFTER they put me on Statins and other beta blockers etc. It DOUBLED in 4 months. SO MUCH FOR Doctors and their medicine on MY old self....<br /><br />  I went back to my juicing and using my VitaMix and in the past 60 days lost over 40 pounds. My wife makes me Vegan wraps and this is where my TACO Bell "treats come into the picture. I just add 6 (yes exactly 6) DROPS to these wraps that each contain less than 90 calories. Along with a dinner salad, that is all I have for diner so the assorted Taco Bell sauces are my TREAT. Now they are not what most ANY doctor I have read would say is a good choice. But I am not using them as most would. I use them as an accent flavor enhancer to add some darn flavor to my very limited diet. And it works great! I have now kept my weight off over 4 months and continue to lose a couple pounds per week since I went back to Cheerios & skim milk for breakfast along with my juicing part time. I (so far) like this and the Taco Bell Spicy Ranchero sauce the best. So I have to give this 4 full stars for how it helps ME....If I used it as you are supposed to I would lower it to 2 stars as I do not feel it is a healthy choice. but used in moderation I can feel like I am eating that good old junk food and yet keeping my cholesterol down below 175. How can I not love this stuff?

I didn't detect any off flavors or nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />I tried it on a roll-up with roast beef and cheese, and it was a nice compliment.<br /><br />I think it would be a bit too spicy for me to use as a salad dressing (a serving suggestion), but I can see using this on a hamburger, roast beef sandwich, fajitas, baked potato, or a panini. I can also see using this as a dip for veggies or fried appetizers like mushrooms, poppers, or even calamari.<br /><br />It ain't health food and I don't expect many healthy ingredients, but on the whole this isn't too bad. Like most processed foods, it has too much salt and a lot more chemicals for my liking, but as an occasional condiment it's o.k.<br /><br />Overall, I'd buy this.

review/summary: Flavored Mayonnaise, Anyone?
review/text: I enjoy trying new flavors, especially sauces and sandwich dressings.  I once inadvertently discovered that a certain flavor of a certain brand of salad dressing is pure heaven on a roast beef sandwich, and now I won't eat roast beef without it.<br /><br />When I saw that Taco Bell had come out with a new line of sandwich dressings, I figured it couldn't hurt to try.  As an Amazon Vine customer, I was able to get two free bottles, so I chose Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Chipotle sauce and Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  The idea of trying them on a sandwich made my mouth water.<br /><br />I had a guest who wanted to try the Chipotle sauce.  OK by me; I figured I'd keep the Jalape&ntilde;o for myself.  He took one bite, on a ham and cheese sandwich, and pronounced it, "Flavored mayonnaise".  I remember thinking it couldn't be that bad, but it didn't bode well that he didn't finish the sandwich.<br /><br />A week or so later, I got some take-out chicken fingers and figured they'd be good to try the sauce with.  Since the Chipotle was already opened, I poured some on a plate used it to dip my chicken fingers in.  I dipped it in.  I tried one, two, three chicken fingers.  My friend was wrong.  It didn't taste like flavored mayonnaise.  It tasted like generic, store brand flavored mayonnaise.  Like real Chipotle, it had a mildly smoky, bacon flavor.  But beyond cheap - it was very, very cheap tasting.<br /><br />This brings us to today.  I had a friend over, and I made some frozen chicken (General Taos's Chicken, if you must know).  As the chicken was frozen and rather bland, I figured it was time to try the Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  I put some out in a dish and we tried it, dipping our chicken into it.  Yecch!  This time, it tasted like generic, Jalape&ntilde;o flavored store brand flavored mayonnaise.  It wasn't very spicy, as I would expect Jalape&ntilde;o to be.  It also wasn't terribly flavorful and, on the whole, it reminded me of the Chipotle sauce, just a little more spicy and maybe a little more boring and cheap tasting.  I wanted to be as fair as possible, so I gamely continued on for another few pieces.  When I realized it had ruined my dinner and I'd had enough, I'd had enough.<br /><br />Shortly before starting this review, I dumped the two half-empty bottles of sauce into my garbage can.  From now on, when I think of sandwich sauces, well, "Yo no quiero Taco Bell".<br /><br />Not recommended.

review/summary: Just the Right Amount of Fire
review/text: My husband is a fan of very spicy food.  He enjoys a lot of heat, but I don't.  If I eat spicy, I usually order mild rather than risk getting something inedible.  Despite the fact that we are pretty much opposites in this area, we both liked this sauce a lot.  He said he wouldn't mind if it was a little hotter, but the flavor was good.  For me, it was getting close to the threshold of too hot, but it didn't cross it. I agree about the flavor overall.<br /><br />The sauce is smooth, and the consistency of bottled salad dressing, if a bit on the thin side.  Not watery, but thinner than, say, ranch dressing.  It's fine drizzled on a salad.  We preferred it as a dip for pretzels and chips.  It was different from any other dip we'd had, but very good.<br /><br />So, four thumbs up - two from each of us!

review/summary: Good if you don't want to use real peppers
review/text: The jalape&ntilde;o sauce looks like many other premade, condiments in the supermarket shelf, except it's lightly green in color, and could be easily glossed over but it is worth another look. Jalapeno's are not just a spicy condiment but they have their own distinct flavor and if you're looking for something that is hot and a little new. This could be for you.<br /><br />The container is easy to open. I know that sounds odd but some bottles become frustrating in how tightly wrapped they are. This is easy to open and access. The sauce itself, pale, pale green with darker colored flecks is fairly smooth but not too watery. Since the spice is powerful this is important. It's not going to run all over the plate when you turn it up, meaning it will not get on foods you don't want it on.<br /><br />Like real jalapenos, the sauce has a bite that sneaks up on you about half way through the meal, so keep a tissue near at hand. The one down side to this is there is a sense of `other' in the sauce. If I were making the sauce from scratch I'd use mayo to carry the flavor but because it has to sit on a shelf this uses soy as a base and has other things mixed in with it with flavor, like garlic. The additions also make it high in sodium and calories.<br /><br />The bottom line is if you want convenience and a different flavor and don't want to take the time with real jalapenos this is good for you. If, however, you're use to working with the real peppers then this will be convenient but you will feel something extra is missing.

review/summary: Different, but not necessary
review/text: I usually dip my french fries in some ranch dressing, occasionally also mixed with hot sauce.  Some of you may find that disgusting.  I find it really adds flavor to a sometimes bland french fry.  And, the hotter the better.<br /><br />When I got the Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce, I decided to try this in place of my usual dipping sauce for french fries (see above).  It had some good flavor to it, but not much "kick."  What jalapeno there is or might be in the sauce is fairly nonexistent.  Give me Taco Bell's "Fire" sauce over this jalapeno sauce any day.  You can taste the jalapeno flavor somewhat, but really none of the heat.<br /><br />Is it good?  Yeah, it's ok, but it didn't knock me off my feet.  Is it necessary?  No.  This sauce doesn't really fill any need or desire for me, though, so I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get it again.

review/text: This "bold & creamy jalape&ntilde;o sauce" is creamy, has the kick of a very mild jalape&ntilde;o, and is bold perhaps by Taco Bell standards. I could not discern a jalape&ntilde;o taste, but the taste is pleasant enough as a dip and would serve nicely as a topping for homemade tacos as an alternative to a traditional taco sauce. I plan to use my bottle as a dip for vegetables and as an addition to salads. I like it well enough but don't think that I will buy another bottle of it.

review/summary: A little different
review/text: Contrary to the implication of the "bold" moniker, this sauce does not have a real strong flavor.  The jalapeno taste is subtle, which is actually a good thing for folks that like just a little bite to their sauce without having to worry about their tongues burning off.  If you are looking for a powerful hot pepper jolt, you aren't going to find it in this product. But it is a bit different of a taste, with a combination of spice and sweetness that fits with a variety of foods.<br /><br />But, at 70 calories a serving, you can accidentally pack on a lot of empty calories using this product.  Compare that to the typical taco sauce with around 10 calories per serving, and that can add up.

review/summary: The Jalapeno Story
review/text: I love the taste of jalapenos but not if they're too hot. My grandfather used to eat jalapeno sandwiches with white bread. I once begged him for a bite and it was so hot I spit it out as I turned red as a beet. I never asked him for another bite but he sure had a good laugh. Anyway, this sauce is a little too hot for my tastes so I add a little ranch to it.<br />I did spread a fine layer on a quesadilla and it tasted great. It's a little runny so watch out!<br />P.S. If you're canning salsa this fall and use jalapenos, wear surgical gloves when you cut them up. I didn't and rubbed my eyes as I was cutting up the onions. It burned so bad!<br />If my grandfather could have seen my eyes burning red and the tears streaming down my face, he would have another good laugh. He's probably in heaven laughing at me anyway.

review/summary: Good on hamburgers and fries
review/text: I'm not a great cook, so we wind up eating a lot of burgers and fries in our house. Instead of picking up fast food, I prepare frozen burger patties and fries in the oven. I tried some of this Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce tonight on the burgers and as a dip for the fries instead of the usual ketchup and mustard. It really woke up the taste and made a normally boring meal a little bit special.<br /><br />I don't know which particular thickening agents are responsible for mouth-feel in a dressing, but I tend to dislike whatever Kraft uses in their salad dressings and sauces; they tend to feel almost slimey or gummy (for lack of a better word) on my tongue with a decidedly "plastic" (i.e., overly processed/fake-food) taste. (And forget the low-fat versions of anything; I'd rather do without than have to taste those!) I prefer the taste and mouth-feel of Ken's salad dressings (especially the 0-carb Creamy Caesar), so if you are familiar with both of these products, maybe the following will make sense to you:<br /><br />The Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce is a lot closer to the mouth-feel of Ken's than to Kraft, but it still has something in it with a bit of that gummy feel to it. It's not nearly as "plastic"-tasting, though, and it's quite tasty on hamburgers I think. It's not scorching hot, but it's got a bit of a kick to it. It pairs well with a slice of raw onion. I actually like it better thinned with a little Duke's mayonnaise, but only because that cuts down even more on the slight gumminess.<br /><br />I expect we'll buy more.

review/summary: Not Quite Sauce, Not Quite Spread, Not Quite Bold
review/text: Now, I love spicy food.  I know from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R6HC2A">Tabasco</a> (I've been to the factory), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZHPFI">Crystal</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004JQW54">Texas Pete</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZHO">Sriracha</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QFRJSA">Cholula</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MGEU0W">sambal</a>, Indian green curry, Jamaican jerk, and all manner of Asian and Southeast Asian hot.  So, this item caught my eye.<br /><br />It's not entirely clear what Taco Bell is going for with this product.  It's a gastronomic oxymoron: a sauce that's kinda spreadable, and a spread you can use as a sauce, and it's creamy and smooth like a friendly salad dressing, yet somehow also spicy and bold.  None of these worked for this consumer.  Decide on one product, Taco Bell, and roll with that.<br /><br />That being said, I think I get the marketing angle.  There are Americans who like the hint of spice, and who love to tell their friends and Facebook that they just loooooove spicy food so totally much, yo.  But what they mean by spicy is the toned-down peppered-ketchup buffalo wings at Applebee's, or maybe even that "bold and spicy" steak sauce they had a tiny taste of once, the one with the cracked pepper in it.  "Bold n' spicy" has marketing cachet these days, and it looks to me like this product is angling to get in on it.  But, this consumer is not impressed, because this sauce is not bold, it's lame.  "Creamy" is for dessert toppings and coffee add-ins, not some faux-TexMex factory liquid.  The attempt to conflate the two together is a failure.<br /><br />It's neither sauce nor spread.  The copy says it's the "perfect finishing touch for your tacos, Mexican salads and sandwich wraps!"  Well, I put truly spicy salsa verde on my tacos, really chunky sauce that has flecks of browned chili skin from the roasting, and has bite and sting...you know, truly spicy, to go with the garlic, onions, black olives, all of the other bold--most certainly non creamy--tastes and textures in Mexican food.  Honestly, even an authentic guacamole isn't "creamy."  I can't really imagine what kind of "Mexican salad" this would go into.  I've made a taco salad or two in my day, and chunky salsa is the only dressing for that; putting this stuff on it would ruin it.  I did, however, make an effort to use this sauce in some sandwich wraps.  Sadly, it's too, uh, saucy, to use as a spread, too runny, with the sauce running out the bottom of the wrap.  If it's going to be a mayo-like (the ingredients list egg yolks, whey, soybean oil and buttermilk) product, it's got to be more firm and spreadable, not a thin sauce.<br /><br />Let's be clear: this product did not taste bad.  I got a slight twinge of jalapeno in there, but nothing even close to spicy, not even "bold."  The taste has a definite mayo/ranch twinge and feel to it.  There are some dark green flecks of some sort in the sauce yielding the slightest hint at texture; it's totally unclear what they are, maybe the bell peppers, parsley or spinach listed in the ingredients.<br /><br />I also don't understand the size of the product, only 8 ounces.  If this is a multi-use product, for all kinds of different dishes and apparently intended as another tableside condiment like ketchup and ranch dressing, why the small package?  It needs to come in at at least 12 ounces to be taken seriously.  I made four sandwich wraps and put some of this sauce on some sausage at dinner, and this package was done.  If Taco Bell wants this to get used, they need to upsize the package.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's sauce, that much is evident, but I'm at a loss as to what I'd put this in while cooking, or what I'd pour it over upon serving.  It's creamy, yeah, but one usually doesn't associate bold, spicy food with creaminess.  Taco Bell is trying to cover all bases with this product, and for me it doesn't work.

review/summary: Really good but is very high calorie
review/text: I like this sauce.  It has just the right spice not to give me heartburn.  Additionally, it goes just well flavoring a burger or on top that good chief salad.  The creamy dressing (less sauce than dressing) gives a zip to a plain salad.  Indeed, I love a nice cottage cheese, tomato, over a bed of lettuce salad.  This adds a nice zing to it.  My teen age son thought it added a lot to his tomato and lettuce cheese burger.  Weirdly, he said this sauce is less hot than the mustard he usually uses.<br /><br />Normally, I would give this a five star ranking.  But it's very high calorie.  Two tablespoons are nearly 110 calories!  Wow, that's a little higher than I like.  That is almost the same calories as 100% olive oil.  "Lite" this isn't.<br /><br />Still, it's mildly hot, good tasting, and goes well with most salads.

review/summary: So-so sauce
review/text: I am giving this a so-so rating of 3 because the sauce itself just didn't jump out at me as being anything special.  It wasn't especially good, but it wasn't especially bad either.<br /><br />On salads I go oil and vinegar all the way so I am unlikely to ever try this on a salad.  However what I do use a variety of sauces for, is flavoring for other dishes.  In particular I often make a dish that consists mostly of lentils and brown rice which is quite delicious and made more so by adding different sauces to it for each serving.  For that reason I am always looking for new and different flavors to add, since each new sauce makes the dish different than the time before, keeping me from getting bored with it.<br /><br />In addition, I love spicy foods.  I don't think of Jalapeno as being especially hot - the only hot Jalapeno peppers I've ever had were the ones I grew and ate fresh-picked.  Nevertheless, I thought a sauce with even a slight kick to it would be great with my lentils.  I was a little disappointed to find that there is not even a slight kick to this sauce.  That said, it wasn't bad either.  It is sort of a creamy, pleasantly flavored sauce that didn't clash with any of the other flavors it was paired with.

review/text: Even in the middle of a heat wave, I love heat: hot sun, spicy food, cayenne, ginger, and jalapenos. So when I saw that Taco Bell had released Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce, I was anxious to try it. They eye pleasing pastel green color with fleck of Jalapeno hints at the kick to come. The sauce base tastes slightly mayonnaise and pours with the consistency of good ranch dressing. It is not runny the way Tabasco sauces are, it stays where you put it. The jalapeno bite is relatively mild, but definitely there. My mouth tingled a good ten minutes after, and never became over bearing.<br />It didn't induce perspiration, cause eye watering or make my head feel as though the top if needed to come off to release the heat. It was pleasantly spicy. I put mine on my breakfast egg wrap and loved every bite.<br />Taco Bell left themselves some room here to increase heat levels (bold, bolder and boldest ever). As far as heat comparisons, I'd say it's probably in the family with Louisiana Hot Sauce or Red Hot.<br />My family likes adding Ranch dressing to Cajun Rice; Bold & Creamy will be an exciting addition. This sauce is creamy enough to get away with using as a salad dressing or veggie dip. If you want to try a finishing sauce with a little kick over grilled chicken, I highly recommend this one and will be telling all my spice loving friends about it. Who knows, even the fearful ones may try this. It could lead to more spice in your life!

review/text: This Taco Bell sauce is a light green, slightly thin product, which reminds me more of a salad type dressing than a sauce for items like burritos.  That's ok, though, because it made a delicious salad dressing.  It has a little peppery heat, less than I would have liked, but still flavorful.  I was taken aback by the 110 calorie count for a 2 tablespoon serving, about what I used for my salad.  It does not have the richness that most high calorie dressings have.  Otherwise, I found it a great alternative to the usual dressing flavors, and I look forward to trying it on my next burrito.

review/summary: Mild heat, slightly sweet
review/text: I received 1 bottle of Taco Ball Jalapeno Sauce as part of the Amazon Vine reviewer program.  Being a lover of all things spicy, especially jalapeno flavored, I was eager to try this product. It says on the bottle that it's to be used on tacos, taco salads and wraps.  I tried it on roast turkey in a pita - the closest to those things I had in my house.<br /><br />A 2 tablespoon serving size is 110 calories, which is probably a generous portion for most people as the spiciness of the sauce is noticeable with very little used. I wouldn't label it 'hot', but mild heat definitely comes through.  Similar to the heat found in Taco Bell's hot sauce, but jalapeno flavor.  Very light green in color, the sauce has the consistency of Ranch dressing.  When tasting it I noted the heat right away and then the jalapeno flavor, which I liked.  What I didn't like was that the longer it was in my mouth, the more it tasted 'sweet' to me.<br /><br />I could see where some will really enjoy this sauce on a taco salad in addition to sour cream and guacamole, but for me the sweetness isn't a flavor I enjoy with Mexican dishes.  I like a bit of 'tart' versus sweet and I'd rather stick with non-creamy varieties of sauces made with jalapeno like salsa verde, or salsas like hot pico de gallo.

I suppose if you are drunk enough at 3 am and weave through the drive thru this stuff all over a soft taco would be heavenly, unfortunately I tasted it stone cold sober in my kitchen and I actually uttered the word "BLECH" ...I bleched and that is a bad sign.<br /><br />This is one bottle of sauce I will not dip into.

review/summary: He says "AMAZING!", I say "Big whoop."
review/text: I was recently hanging at my brother's house and a friend came over. He had stopped at Taco Bell on his way over and commenced eating his lunch while we played a rousing game of Scrabble. At one point, I had grabbed his Taco Bell bag off the table with the intention of throwing it away to clear space on the table when he snatched the bag and said I almost threw away his green sauce. He explained that Taco Bell has this AMAZING new sauce and that he had snaged lots of packets of the stuff so he could stockpile some at home. When I asked if I could try it, he refused to share.<br /><br />When I received my monthly Amazon Vine newsletter, I noticed they were offering up some of Taco Bell's AMAZING green sauce, so out of curiosity I requested it. My final opinion? Whoop-de-doo! It's got some mild kick (I emphasize mild, because I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy foods and I had no problem with it), which can add a bit of dimension to some bland food, but the sauce itself is borderline tasteless. I tried it on tacos and found it less than thrilling. It added some creaminess, but I think I still prefer adding some good 'ole fashioned salsa to my taco. I then started adding it to random foods to see where it would fit in... As a dip for chicken strips? Nope. Dip for fries? Definitely not. Chip dip? No. As a substitute for mayo on a sandwich? Yeah, it works there. Seeing as it fit best as a sandwich condiment, I'd be more likely to grab this if I saw it in with the mayo than I would be if I was in the Mexican food section at Walmart.<br /><br />Nutritionally, it's not exactly healthy (it's a creamy sauce, what can you expect?) but then again, if you're planning on adding condiments to your Taco Bell Cheesy Gordita Crunch, I'm thinking calorie counting isn't your thing. Give it a try- obviously there are those out there who love this stuff! Personallly, I'll stick with my salsa and guacamole.

review/summary: Awful - has an off flavor
review/text: Let me just kick this off by saying that I like most of what Taco Bell has to offer in their fast food restaurants. I can't stand their red sauce that comes on some of the burritos but that is about it.<br /><br />How are you going to know if your taste matches mine? Let me list a few like and dislikes and that may help you decide if this sauce is for you.<br /><br />Like: Mustard, sour creme, ketchup, buttermilk ranch dressing (on pizza only), sweet hot mustard, brown mustard, spicy stuff. So, generally savory condiments and food.<br /><br />Dislike: Mayo of any kind shape or form. All salad dressing except Ranch as noted above (that's right, I eat my salads plain and it is oh so good). Sweet things that should be savory like sweet pickles or relish or chow chow. Things I know are mayo based like guacamole.<br /><br />This jalapeno sauce is savory not sweet.<br /><br />Really TB won me over about 20 years ago when they came out with their Wild Sauce. That stuff was awesome! Anyway, since then I am always open minded when they come out with something new.<br /><br />So, when I saw this in the store a while back I grabbed it up! Jalapeno sauce?! Yum! heh<br /><br />Made tacos that night just so I could try it out. Yuck. I gave it a real try too, first just a taste and then a good little amount. I tried it with a little on a tortilla chip. I had another person try it. She didn't like it either.<br /><br />First off, there is a distinct flavor that has nothing to do with jalapenos. And it is not a good flavor. I assume this sauce is sour creme based but I guess they could be using some kind of cheap mayo. Whatever.<br /><br />Secondly, jalapeno? Where's the jalapeno flavor? Perhaps it has one but it is so mild it is overpowered by the other strong flavor in the base of whatever makes up this sauce.<br /><br />It wasn't spicy.<br /><br />So. If you are not a big fan of TB then I'd give this a wide berth.<br /><br />If you love all things TB then I think you should try it out. This is the sort of thing that really demands a taste test to know if you'll like it or not.

review/summary: Versatile Spicy Sauce
review/text: I was amazed to see that something from Taco Bell didn't have any partially hydrogenated oils, but I suppose with a sauce of this nature, room-temperature solids aren't necessary. The ingredients aren't completely natural, of course (there are few 'x's in the ingredient list), but it's not horrendous. The creamy and spicy flavor is unique and works well on a salad or in tacos to add a richer dimension to whatever you're having. It will never replace my Tapatio, but it could make a good complement every once in a while.

review/summary: Spicy!
review/text: This is spicy but tastes great.  However, its not for folks that don't like jalapenos.  My kids didn't care for it and they are used to spicy stuff.  I would use sparingly at first.  Plan to keep some in my fridge for taco night!

review/summary: Not so good
review/text: To keep it plain and simple - this sauce is not very good. If you are looking for that distinct Taco Bell taste at home this just doesn't do the job. It isn't that it's necessarily bad, it's just if you're going to put a sauce on your food it should enhance the flavor, not overpower it like this does. I tried to use it 3 times but ended up throwing it away. Back to the drawing board, Taco Bell

review/summary: Not a fan... they need to have a Baja sauce available instead!
review/text: This sauce was not what I expected from a "Jalapeno" flavored product. It didn't taste much like jalapenos, instead it tasted like a bad ranch. I was really disappointed with this sauce. I tried just a taste out of the bottle before using it with food and was not impressed. When I added it to my tacos, it felt like I had added a strange tasting ranch to it (no improvement when combined with other taco toppings/seasonings). I threw it in the garbage after a few days. My husband did not like it either and he is usually a fan of jalapeno flavored things as well. Not worth it. Now if they only offered Baja sauce... ;)

review/summary: Creamy and flavorful and perfectly seasoned
review/text: I love spicy foods and dips so I was happy to try this and was pleasantly surprised that the flavor was rich & creamy and while you can taste the jalapenos it is NOT spicy hot at all. It is great as a dip for chips or even chicken strips and I used it in a potato au gratin casserole with cheese and sour cream and it added great flavor and even the kids liked it. I would use it as a sauce over chicken or pork too.

review/summary: A slightly zesty, overly thick ranch dressing
review/text: Don't get me wrong, for stuff marketed in the name of the cheapest fast food joint in the multiverse, this is pretty good. That said, it's only about as good as you'd expected for stuff marketed in the name of the cheapest fast food joint in the multiverse.<br /><br />I can see this stuff being helpful in seriously watering down an overly spicy batch of burrito beef or something, but really it's no better suited for that than sour cream, which is much cheaper. Also, this stuff tastes a little plasticky and caots your throat in a very unpleasant manner.<br /><br />If they have little squeezey packets of this at Taco Bell, I might use a bit of it on my next chalupa. Otherwise, it's eminently forgettable.

review/summary: A Little Spicy, Mostly Creamy: An Interesting Take on Dressing
review/text: You should be forewarned, this is no picante sauce -- in fact, if anything, it's quite a bit more like a salad dressing: a creamy, ranch style dressing with hints of tex-mex seasoning and a very slight degree of heat.<br /><br />It is a very versatile sauce. Clearly, it makes for a great salad dressing on Taco Night, if you do that sort of thing. It also works well in a number of other applications. Playing around with my usual tex-mex routine, I found this dressing worked very well as a compliment to spinach in a quesadilla, a combination I would highly recommend.

review/text: The family loved this and the product was used up rather quickly.  Placed on salads and main dishes, the sauce added a spicy tang to the flavor without overwhelming the dish.  The flavor was reminiscent of other Taco bell dishes, so those of you who like to eat there will thoroughly enjoy this sauce.

review/summary: Eh... its just ok.... creamy, no kick...
review/text: Well, its creamy but not bold... there's really no kick to it. I would think for jalapeno sauce it would have some sort of kick to it. Although it is tasty at first.. its not something we would continue to buy and keep trying. Maybe once it a while... but unlikely for us. By all means its not bad... and for someone people you may like the creamy taste with not a big kick to it. Its going to be trial and error but if your looking for that huge kick flavor its not there....<br /><br />We used it on potatoe chips and its a good dip texture wise, not to thick so it doesn't break the chip. Did attempt on a salad but... it did not taste to well. Again think it comes down to everyones taste buds are different.

review/text: This jalapeno sauce is pretty good. The flavor is new and different than other jalapeno sauces I have tried - it is a fresh take on taco sauce. It is not as spicy as expected/hoped, but is still good. The sauce is nice and creamy (reminds me a little of sour cream). A great topping for your favorite taco!

review/text: Good sauce...close your eyes, and you'll think you made a Taco Bell run.  That statement is either a turn-on or a turn-off, depending on your view of Taco Bell.<br /><br />Not too spicy, but man...does it have alot of fat calories!  I'd say- if you REALLY love Taco Bell, if you REALLY love their jalapeno sauce, go for it. Otherwise, go for something with a little less fat but just as much taste.

review/text: This sauce was too spicy--it tasted as if the sauce was relying on its other spices to do the work rather than giving it enough of a jalapeno flavor. It's an okay sauce--nothing that I would do a midnight run to the store for.

review/text: Look , jalepeno sauce is an acquired taste. Some sauces are wimpy and unsatisfying. Some are so overbearing that it detracts from the taste. This Taco Bell issue is exactly where it needs to be. Too little , and you add more ; too much and it's find me a paper towel to wipe the sweat from my brow . !  I'm thrilled Taco Bell has put their products out for the general public. A great value , as the bottle lasted a very long time.

review/summary: Tasty and creamy
review/text: We tried this sauce on several different dishes, both Mexican and not, and it worked well with all of them. Think of it as a creamy salad dressing with a nice jalapeno bite to it. Our only reservation is that it has a very slight "bottled" flavor to it, i.e., not completely fresh, so I wouldn't recommend it for that haute cuisine meal you're making for the boss. Kids like it but don't want too much of it because of the jalapeno taste. I'd recommend it for casual eating wherever you need a creamy and spicy sauce.

review/summary: Jalapeno illusion
review/text: The sauce is green, and that's about as "jalepeno" as it gets.  I didn't detect even a hint of jalapeno flavor, and as for heat, it's like looking for it in the heart of the Antarctic.  It just isn't there.<br /><br />That doesn't mean it's a total loss though--it's a great sauce for burgers, dip for chicken nuggets, etc. when you want something different.  The flavor is hard to describe, somewhat creamy, somewhat tangy, but mostly vague and innocuous.  I wasn't thrilled, neither was my husband.  We wouldn't buy this flavor again, as it was a disappointing jalapeno illusion.<br /><br />It's best success for us was on a turkey burger with avocado, tomato, lettuce and onion.  No heat, but it really does remind me more of some kind of "dressing" than it does anything I'd call a "sauce".  Even so, if I had to choose between ranch and this for the turkey burger--the ranch dressing wins.

review/text: This is a mayo based sauce with a strong vinegar tase and just mild heat. I cannot imagine using it on a crispy taco as pictured on the product label. I tried it as a dip for tamales and it was horrible. It has that odd taste like old mayo that you need to throw out. Maybe it could work on a wrap, a sandwich, or mixed into a pasta or potato salad, but this is NOT a match for ANY Mexican food I can think of. Yuk.
