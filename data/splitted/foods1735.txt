review/summary: YUMMY!
review/text: I love these bars!  It is hard to find decent gluten-free snacks, and, these are a treasure!  They are packed with crunchy nuts and sweet fruit.  I like that they are all natural, too.  I don't feel guilty indulging with these.  They are great to take along to the office, for lunch or snacks, or on the road, and, considering their size, they are really quite filling and satisfying! They are, of course, a little pricey, but, buying them by the case from Amazon (especially if you use Subscribe and Save) makes them less expensive than they are at the local health food store. Excellent!

review/summary: one of a KIND, delicious gluten free bar
review/text: I have never been one to rely on nor crave a bar. Following a gluten-free and low- allergy controlled diet, I stumbled across these KIND bars while looking for nutritious options for my teens, thinking I would be able to try them. Well indeed they truly are scrumptuous. My 18 year old loves them and when running out the door will grab one or two for the road. I have only tried the Walnut and Date and the Cranbery, Almonds and Oxidants as I follow a blood type diet and do not love things that are too sweet. We are on our second box of each and I will be looking at the other varieties to try in time.

review/text: I'm currently doing a self experiment where I have cut out all dairy and all gluten for a month.  I didn't realize that in doing this, I'd have to be making almost every single meal I ate from scratch.<br /><br />I knew about Larabars, but I wanted something with more crunch for snacks that I could throw in my bag.  I stumbled upon these at a local store, bought one of each flavor, and just fell in love.  The Almond Coconut is my favorite.  It really tastes like a candy bar!  It's so nice to have something so healthy in my bag so that I can avoid temptation when temptation strikes!  Thanks KIND!!!<br /><br />Oh, and I ordered these on a Wednesday morning, and they were delivered on that Friday afternoon!  Thanks Amazon!

Sugar and Glucose in the cranberry bars and honey and Glucose in the almond & coconut. Don't get me wrong, they are pretty tasty and somewhat healthy but just a little too sweet for me. knock some of the sugar out and it would be an excellent health snack.

I mean, I am not excessively chewing or anything, I am pretty sure I am using a normal mastication pace, but after eating a full bar, my mouth would be pretty tired. I think this bar is for diets or something.

review/text: These bars are made from a host of natural sources and taste great, but are also calorie dense and high in fats (nuts are high in fat), high in carbs, and are very sweet. I ordered the apricot/coconut which is heavenly, and almost inhaled two boxes. I started to notice some weight gain and when I checked the calorie count, I was shocked to see that one little bar has up to 190 calories! I was eating up to 3-4 bars a day because they taste so good and are small and light. I realized that I consuming over 700 additional calories daily. Yikes! I think these are great for athletes and runners who burn lots of calories and need the extra fuel or as a snack in between meals. The only problem is that they are small and light and for me I don't get enough satisfaction from just one bar.

review/summary: Eat at your own risk
review/text: Kind bars taste great and pack a nutritional punch, but they pack another kind of punch as well.  On October 10, I bit into an almond/fruit bar and broke a front crown.  What made it worse (and more expensive) is that I was en route from Chicago to San Francisco at the time so the accident made it imperative to seek emergency dental care for a temporary crown in SF and then have the permanent crown made upon my return home.  Total sticker price for that Kind bar:  $1665, not counting the cost of the bar itself.  I called Kind's corporate headquarters in New York and was referred to its insurance company, Chubb, which declined to assist me with any of my bills on the grounds that the company was not negligent.  That's a matter of interpretation, I think, but rather than pursue silly litigation that would cost more than I've already spent, I think I'll just do my civic duty and warn Kind's buyers in the most public way I can think of to beware when eating these bars.  They're delicious, but they can break teeth.  Let the Kind eater beware:  caveat emptor, caveat vore.

review/text: I was looking for a healty snack and these got good reviews. My first impression was that these are very small and extremely bland tasting. The almonds were slightly soft and did not thaste very much like almonds, but it was edible. The second bar had a spot that tasted really bad as if one of the nuts were bad. The third bar was ok, but then it was almost every bar after that was bad. I ended upo throwing the last few bars away. The packaging was sealed properly and it was well within it's expiration date. These bars also have a way of twisting your teeth around to the point I thought I might have damaged one of my teeth. If you want an equally healthy snack for a better price, pick up a bag of mixed nuts/trail mix from your grocery store.

review/text: The almond and apricot bars make the best emergency snacks I've found. The bar is pliable rather than extra chewy or crunchy, and while it's definitely sweet it's not as sweet as the ones with yogurt. Finishing one is usually enough to fix a hungry headache or blood-sugar crash, and satiating enough that I'm not rooting around for more food if I've somehow skipped lunch. The gluten-free is an extra bonus; I've got a few friends with celiac, so being able to share with them is quite nice.

I highly recommend this product, and will certainly be adding them to my to overall healthy diet. You will not be sorry if you purchase this product.

review/text: I love these bars although the sesame is one of my least favorite flavors but the dark chocolate with nuts or peanut butter and the fruit nut or coconut are wonderful flavors and i think they make for a perfect healthy snack. If i want something sweet i will grab one of these and im satisfied. I also love that these are gluten free!!!

review/summary: My favorite food, finally fresh and best possible price!
review/text: I use these bars (macadamia and apricot are my favorite) as meal replacements on the go. They have a tremendous energy punch and satiate my hunger for a long time. The best thing about them is that they taste like real food, not some dry rice crispy treat like so many others.<br /><br />Getting these through Amazon is wonderful because I finally get fresh bars (usually expired in the health food stores near me if I can find them at all) and a terrific price. I definitely recommend subscribing. It's a great service.

review/summary: This Made My Day
review/text: After searching high and low for some kind of snack food bar to stash in my purse that wasn't chock full of soy, hydrogenated oils and other nasty things I gave these a go - and I was amazed!<br /><br />These are delectable - really almost like eating candy, only good for you. I tried about four different flavors so far and have liked them all. I appreciate that the labels are quite clear, so those of us who can't have soy can see at a glance exactly which ones we can and can't have.<br /><br />These did not get mushed or sticky or stale the way so many things do - they are a fantastic option and I will definitely be buying more!

review/text: My husband is diagnosed with Celiac Disease and therefore always looking for gluten-free foods.  The Kind Bars have become a regular staple item in our food pantry.  They are ideal for a quick snack or as a travel snack. He is pleased to have found them available from Amazon in bulk quantity, therefore reducing the cost.  Gluten-free foods tend to be very expensive and being able to get them from Amazon is wonderful.

review/summary: One of my favorite
review/text: I absolutely love the flavor of the Kind bars, and this one is my favorite.  For people complaining about the fat.....NUTS HAVE FAT.  But that is the only source of fat in these bars.  Nuts are also full of vitamins and minerals..oh yes and PROTEIN.  These actually do taste like candy, and are a great pick me up snack.  If you want something filling though, and more of a meal replacement...go with Clif bars.  They can keep you going for quite awhile.  My real complaint with these?  The price.  No matter where you get them, they are on the high end.  I have 4 children and I cannot afford to keep these around as a regular staple.  Even buying directly, you have to get them in cases of 72..for over a 100 bucks.  Larabars if I am savvy I can get for about 1.00 a bar, and even though the texture is different (since they pretty much pulverize the nuts) are awesome and simple healthy organic, non GMO, gluten free, raw diet, vegan, most are lactose free variety's, and if the word peanut is not in the ingredients they were made in a non-peanut plant.  Kind can boast most of these too....larabars do take a couple extra steps.  they are also free-trade certified.....Oh and they have 19 flavors of their basic bars.

review/summary: great sweet treat
review/text: Every once in a while, I'll have a KIND bar for my 3 'o clock snack at work. I had no problem polishing off my whole box in around 2 weeks all by myself, because they're so delicious!<br /><br />Like other reviewers have said, the bar tastes really sweet. I'm a candy/chocolate-loving person and I prefer the KIND bar for my sugar fix. It does have 16g carbs, of which 13g are sugar, so while it may be "all natural", it has quite a bit of "all natural" sugar. While not the healthiest snack option, its satisfying and yummy enough to keep me away from my even less healthy options.<br /><br />Though I enjoyed the Almond & Apricot bar, my favorite is the Macadamia and Apricot. If you're worried about a lot of chewiness like some of the other reviewers, try the Macadamia option. It is truly melt-in-your-mouth delicious and the soft macadamias perfectly complement the sweet chewiness of the fruit and coconut with an amazing texture. I haven't tried any other flavors, but I will soon!

review/summary: Better than most bars, for sure- very nutty!
review/text: I usually don't like "nutrition" bars- if I'm hungry and in a hurry, I don't like to try and choke down a grain-type bar that requires a lot of water  or liquid to get it down. These bars are great because there's no grain involved. It's just a delightful blend of dried fruit and crunchy toasted almonds- a bit of a tang to balance out the sweetness. Not TOO dry- still moist, chewy, crunchy, and very delicious.<br />I realize grains may be important to some people, but I usually just have trouble eating those style bars.<br />This, I look forward to- and in a pinch, it makes a tasty dessert- healthier than lots of other things.

review/text: Like others have commented, Amazon has done a really poor job with the packaging on these.  The 12-pack ships from Missouri, and I'm not sure what kind of storage facilities Amazon or UPS has, but the bars are completed melted by the time you receive them, which is very disappointing.  When Amazon used to carry the sesame-peanut-chocolate in the 8-pack, the biggest complaint was that those bars were too tough to chew.  Now they're just mushy.  Bring back the tough bars!

review/summary: I like Kind bars but not this flavor
review/text: This flavor has an overwhelming peanut, i.e. peanut butter flavor with a tart, fruity flavor reminding me of a PB&J sandwich.  I didn't enjoy it but that may be because I don't like peanut butter.  Too many peanuts ("nuts" to me doesn't mean a majority of peanuts) and too tart of fruit, too pasty texture of fruit as well as too much of it.  I prefer nutty with no peanuts and chewy, sweeter fruit pieces.  My bars were fresh and chewy (a tad on the soft side).  I'd picked up various flavors at small local stores and enjoyed them so grabbed this when it went on sale to try.  I'll not buy this flavor again but do recommend the brand.

review/text: The cost of the items is very high.  Almost $1.60 for each bar.  In my opinion, this is excessive.<br /><br />However, these bars are fantastic and you can literally see all of the nuts (whole) that make the bar.  The exterior is slightly sweet, but is really balanced with the falvor and crunch of the nuts.  It is about the perfect size bar for my breakfast.<br /><br />I bought the one's in the yogurt since it gives the bar a creamy smooth flavor.<br /><br />I will continue to buy them since they're the best nut bar I've had.

Boy was I blown away by its freshness and rich flavors. I started with the coconut almond. So yummy and filling. A perfect way to grab a quick bite when you're on the go and without sacrificing health or flavor. Highly recommended!

review/summary: A little stale...but I'll give them another chance
review/text: I searched out my favorite KIND bars on Amazon because I was buying them every day at the mini mart for nearly two dollars each.  These are the best; not too sweet, very filling, perfect for a post-workout craving.  I signed up for Subscribe and Save to get the best deal and because I know I'll go through these things. My first delivery came within a week but I'm sad to say that they were stale.  Not flat-out gross, thankfully they still taste good. But they are super hard and chewy (much more so than normal) and appear to have been exposed to high heat, like they melted a bit at some point.  I've got to admit that I never looked at the expiration date on one that I've bought at a mini mart, but that's probably because they've never been stale or given me cause to question the freshness. As it turns out, the case I have now was delivered in September 2012 and expires in October 2013, so they should be fine. Hopefully, this was just a fluke and the next case will be better.  If not, they're getting returned and I'll find another source.  So, the KIND Fruit & Nut bars would normally get 5 stars from me, but my experience by ordering them through Amazon brought them down a few stars.  I'll try to remember to update in the future.

review/summary: Stays better intact than protein bars in the heat
review/text: Usually, I consume protein bars during my work day, but I had to search for something to replace those bars during the hotter months in my part of California because protein bars melt quite quickly if not stored in a cooler with ice packs. I was on the search for something that would not weigh me down during the work day, taste good, and portable. I tried several other flavors before I found two that agreed with my taste buds - almond & coconut and nut delight.

review/summary: Best healthy bars ever!
review/text: I'm 73yrs old and have eaten lots of bars that are new or old to the market, plus the ones I make myself or are homemade by others. Got lots of favorites, but none of them beat KIND for flavor, calories, variety, healthfulness, ingredients, etc.<br /><br />I am going to order more today and will keep ordering until I've tried them all with few exceptions.

This is also the cheapest way to buy KIND bars,  especially when you get free shipping from Amazon.  And, because they are all-natural and gluten-free, I can confidently share them with all of my friends.

review/summary: On A Snack Mission
review/text: I grabbed a variety of various protein/energy bars, including a few different KIND bars after I got a free sample of the Dark Chocolate & Sea Salt. The DCK & Sea Salt flavor is now my ultimate measuring stick for the rest of the salty sweet snacks KIND provides. The Almond & Apricot flavor is particularly disappointing, unfortunately. Many of the other varieties are very satiating and flavorful, but the apricot fruit in combination with the nuts in this bar are a misplaced one. They just don't make sense on my pallet.

review/summary: In the past 6 months the bars got smaller and price went up
review/text: Even though I like the taste of these bars (Apricot & Macademia) because of presense of macademia nuts, i am kind of upset with the company (KIND).  In the past 6 months, the bars got A LOT smaller, and price for an individual bar went up.  I hate when companies do that. It's called greed.<br />As the the stale taste (in other reviews) -- I do know that macademia nuts go stale very fast.  I don't know what can be done about that, short of making them salty for preservation.

review/summary: BILLED AS NEW FLAVOR AUGUST 2012
review/text: This was billed as a new flavor being carried on Amazon in August 2012. I bought it on a Gold Deal Special.<br /><br />I have 5 cats and they all absolutly love it. This spoiled group of kids are given their wet food at about 5 pm each evening. Kibble is available all day, but wet food is treat time.<br /><br />On the evening of the day I received this, I gave my inside kitties (4) a total of 6 three oz cans of wet food, with two of them being the Chicken, Tuna, and Wild Rice entree. Additionally, my outside kitty, who is Feral, but has been trapped and neutered, also got a can.<br /><br />All three can were immediately eaten and eaten before the other flavors; although, I did include  a Tiki flavor<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0MFX0">TIKI Cat Napili Wild Salmon & Chicken in Chicken Consomme (Pack of 12 2.8 Ounce Cans)</a> and a Fancy Feast favorite which was a Talipia Appetizer<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQDDY">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Steamed Tilapia, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a> in the mix so I could be certain that the Pro Plan was being eaten because it was liked and Not because it was the only decent thing available. And to be totally fair, I put out Pro Plan favorites which were a Turkey and a Salmon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TACYNG">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food, Salmon, Shrimp and Rice Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CI96G">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Turkey and Rice Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />It has been two or three weeks since I first received this Chicken and Tuna Entree made by Pro Plan. It continues to dissapear every night; although, a half dish of some flavors always make it to morning.And though the Chicken and Tuna is a great meal, the Pro Plan White Meat Chicken and Veggies is their favorite in the Pro Plan Chicken line up....at least so far:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TACZDU">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food, White Meat Chicken and Vegetable Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />So, I would recommend this to all my Amazon Friends' Kitties. My Kitties say your kitties will most likely love this IF THEY ARE CHICKEN eater...we know how delicate they all are. So, thank you from: Trinity, Gabriella, Wisdom,Mercy and "Yellow Kitty...my feral guy."

review/summary: Best BBQ Sauce - My favorite!
review/text: Have been to Rendezvous in Memphis several times and have decided that this is my very favorite sauce, hands down.  I like the regular and the Hot, along with the rub.  Born and raised in the South, lived in Texas for a while, and have been eating delicious BBQ all my life.  I was partial to a sweeter sauce until I met Rendezvous. Give it a try - you won't be disappointed!  And be sure to visit the restaurant in Memphis - it's a real winner!

review/summary: Good but STINKY
review/text: We constantly search for the right treats- no arsenic laden rawhides for our girl, but what to give her? At only 15 pounds, she is half beagle, so she fits into a power chewer category. We loved this bag of bully bites, and so does she- she gets to pick one out every nite - it's her bedtime "chewie" -- but SOMETIMES we have to counteract it's "fragrance" with a little room deodorizer.  Just opening the bag will produce a pretty pungent smell, which of course, the dog loves... it's just a but harsh on human noses....<br />still better than rawhides, 100% protein, no wheat, no corn, no fillers, just little bites of baked bullwinkles... I guess if you're a dog, it would be heavenly....

review/summary: Dog goes bonkers for these, keeps him occupied for quite a while
review/text: These are pretty dry, so they last a while. I do like to check on my dog to make sure that he doesn't try to swallow the bigger pieces that he chews off, but it's still a great product. He loves to chew them, if I need some time to do something and don't want to put him in his crate, this is a sure-fire way to occupy him.<br /><br />The saddest part is when I take one away. I like to rotate through a few of them, after it gets saturated with spit it becomes very easy to destroy, so if you let them dry in between chewing sessions they seem to last longer. Gross, but it works.<br /><br />I would say that my dog is a fairly aggressive chewer, and he takes 40-60 minutes total to destroy one, but that's when you let it dry in between sessions. If I gave it to him and let him go nuts, he'd probably have it gone in 30.

review/summary: Excellent creamy, rich, and chocolaty
review/text: As the title suggests, this coffee to be creamy, rich, and chocolaty in a savory way.  It is not over the top chocolaty.  Most importantly it has a crisp and fresh taste.  I brewed this in a French press and currently this is the favorite flavor of the month.  Having tried many different mocha coffee beans that run the gambit in quality and flavor, I rate this one worst buying.<br /><br />There is no such thing as the perfect coffee and even if there was, the water and the process of making it is as important as the coffee beans.  On top of that, it is most subjective.  So I rate this as 5 stars because it is a great quality blend where it is possible to achieve that "Wow, this is great coffee!" effect.  Your mileage may vary.
