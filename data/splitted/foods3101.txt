review/text: In the stressful world we live in it's nice to relax with a warm cup of Natural Calm Magnesium at the end of the day - I get better results with this product than any magnesium pill I've tried.  My kids love it too and say it helps them fall asleep faster.  Arrived quick, and a better price than at the local store!

review/summary: Love this stuff!!!
review/text: I don't usually leave product reviews, but this stuff is worthy of doing so.  I have taken magnesium supplements in various forms in hopes that they would help me get to sleep and stay asleep.  Natural Calm is the only supplement that has helped with my insomnia.  Every evening, I have a mug with a heaping teaspoon of Natural Calm in some water.  It really does help with my ability to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep all night.  I used to lie in bed and wait to fall asleep, sometimes for hours.  Now I can't even remember trying to get to sleep.  This product is wonderful!

review/summary: Good, but FAR TOO SWEET!!
review/text: I use this to calm my generally overactive system, deal with stress and sleep better, and it's not unpleasant. It's sweetened with Stevia, which I prefer to any other sweetener. One star off: it's horribly SWEET!! Most American-made sweet goods are sweet to such a degree that sometimes it's hard to detect any other taste, but even by those standards this stuff is incredibly oversweetened. I'll use it, but I wish there were another, less sweet and more natural flavor available. How about, say, mango or grape...?

review/text: I am disappointed to report that although this product did seem to have an effect on my anxiety the first time I took it, the second time I took it, it made me very nauseated. It may be the stevia; I am quite sensitive to artificial sweeteners (although I thought stevia was natural). At any rate, I am going to have to get rid of this product because I'd rather be anxious than vomiting. Call me crazy. If you are sensitive to non-sugar sweeteners, you may want to try a sample of this beforehand if you can find one before you shell out the money.

review/text: This stuff is truly amazing. Previously I had chemotherapy and the drugs took just about all the hormones away, hence giving me hot flashes. Calm helped to restore the balance and get me back on track, since I was kind of young for menopause. It has also taken my monthly cycle from 30-45 days right down to 28 days. It really is a great product. Magnesium is also wonderful for helping the body absorb calcium. I have been taking it for almost 8 months and I wouldn't think of stopping.

I actually look forward to having this in the AM with my breakfast and in the PM before bed. You can feel the relaxation slightly, it is not overwhelming. Not the kind of thing that knocks you out when you take it, but if you pay attention you can feel it.<br /><br />The great thing about the calcium is it is a great way to help sustain and maintain weight loss. This is the best flavor they offer no doubt about it.

review/summary: Don't get Orange flavor
review/text: orange seemed most appealing to me, but I do not like it. It works, but I have to build up to it. I just really don't like drinking it. It is really tart, slightly orange tasting, and I have a hard time getting it down. I have to chug it quickly. I'd rather take a pill and get it over with quickly. Just blech. I'd rather take Bluebonnet Calcium/Mag Vit D liquid, and that is a thick goopy liquid but I only need 2 TB of it. This is just hard drinking a whole glass. Aside from the texture/sense issue, the product works well, and I don't get restless legs at night. It does help me sleep and I am in a better mood since taking it.

review/text: I have had a very easy pregnancy except for these insane charlie horses in the middle of the night. My midwife prescribed a magnesium supplement and suggested this brand. It took about 2 - 2.5 weeks for the leg cramps to go away completely but I haven't had a leg cramp since (unless I don't take it every day). I also find that I fall asleep faster and I am able to go straight back to bed after getting up in the night to go to the bathroom.

review/summary: GREAT STOOL SOFTENER!
review/text: I do not get the calm relaxing better sleeping side effects from this. What I do get though is something that keeps my bowels regular. I take a medicine that causes heavy constipation, some users resort to taking laxatives every day which is addictive and dangerous. This is the best thing to clear you out and move things along. I've had two children and they send you home with a stool softener (Collace for me) and this works far better than collace. I started out about a week on just one large teaspoon. I was very bloated and backed up the entire time, it wasn't really doing much, then I upped to two large teaspons, without being graphic, it completely fixed my problem, although there were a few times if I hadn't been very close to a bathroom it could have resulted in a very traumatizing event. I don't think it tastes bad at all, I enjoy the warm drink in the evening, I put honey in mine, and use the natural one.

review/summary: LOVE this stuff!
review/text: Our chiropractor recommended Natural Calm for more muscle relaxation and deeper sleep - and my entire family takes it.  We've adjusted the dose for our 10 y/o downward (1/4 t. per day) and that's been better for him, but for my husband and me, the 1/2 t. dose is just right.  :)<br /><br />Our child has benefitted from it in that when he sleeps more deeply and doesn't wake easily, he has better days in lessons and is better able to focus.  That alone would make me re-purchase this product!  :)<br /><br />When we take it, we sleep better, more deeply, and if(when) we get up in the night to use the restroom, we don't struggle to fall back asleep - sleep is just *there*.  :)  I've also found that my "side stitches" - where the muscles at my ribcage contract and pull (it's uncomfortable) - go away when I take NC.  That's a beautiful side effect from taking it - and one I didn't expect.  My husband's infamous "Charley Horses" that wrack his legs with pain are virtually gone, too - and adding the NC has been the only change in his habits, so it's not like he's attributing the lack of cramps to anything else he's doing.<br /><br />I'm also a PCOS patient, which means I trend towards overproducing insulin.  With that, comes rough elbows and ridiculously dry skin - the NC has helped in that area as well.  My normal moisturizer doesn't touch my elbow-roughness, but the NC takes care of it on its own.  w00t!<br /><br />We like the lemon-raspberry flavour as well - it's like a hot lemonade in a mug.  :)<br /><br />All in all, we'll definitely be ordering more - I don't ever want to be without this supplement!

review/text: I can't write this review based off of continued use, as we just received it this week.  However, I wanted to say how glad I am that this product is available.  I have one child with asthma and another with autism.  Magnesium is suppose to benefit them both a lot, BUT getting children to take it is another story!  It's very sour and zingy, if that's a word, so the magnesium has taken a lot of coaxing to get them to take daily.  So I find this product of Peter Gillham's, and I'm so happy.  The kids say it tastes like warm sweet lemonade, and down it goes like a treat.  Also, very comforting to take just before going to bed.  Yeah!

It does have a "good" effect on your bowel movement, it's not a bad thing, it keeps you cleansed. I would highly recommend this for any with muscle, joint or bone pain.

review/summary: Natural flavor is NOT neutral
review/text: I bought the "natural" flavor, assuming it would be flavorless.  WRONG!  I bought it with the intention of adding it to my morning protein shake but it has a somewhat bitter citrus-y flavor that doesn't work in the shake.  I guess I need to try it just in water and see if I can tolerate it that way.  It's probably a great product/supplement but I'm having trouble getting past the taste.  Probably would have been better to get a flavored variety.

review/text: This product delivers all it claims, helps to relax your mind and muscles for a good nights sleep. I would have been purchasing this before now if I had known about it. With all the medications for sleep on the market it was nice to find a natural non-pharmaceutical, non-addictive calming sleep aid.

review/text: This is a 2 fold product and you must be aware of this. It is great at making me drowsy before bedtime but it is also a stool softener! So...you need to experiment with how much you need/can take comfortably. I call it my cheese to magnesium ratio! It is a great product and I use it a lot...just with care. One rounded teaspoon in very warm water before bed seems to be " my level". Great product and service.

review/text: I drink this every afternoon with two heaping teaspoons in 16 ounces of water. This does not make me either sleepy nor calm. However it is both a good way to hydrate (the stuff tastes good) and get a daily dose of magnesium so I like it and will purchase it again.<br /><br />I am writing this a month or two later and this, in fact does calm me and it also promotes a good night's sleep.

review/summary: I am not sure if it has helped me
review/text: I have purchased this product due to its amazing reviews.  I have been having horrible health issues that started after taking a diet pill which has caused me drastic changes to my health.  I have been having issues with my digestive system, emotions, IBS, I never had heartburn now I do, I have cracked tongue, dry tongue, metallic taste in my mouth, I dont digest well my food.  I have done too many tests and nothing has been coming up but only GERD and have taken so many treatments for this but nothing helps me. :(<br /><br />I thought maybe this would help me but I dont see any change in anything.  Its been 5 days since I started.  I started with half teaspoon in morning and night, and then after a day did 1 tsp twice a day, then did 2 x a day but started to have diarrhea so now I am back to 1 twice a day.  I do not see it has made any changes, maybe it takes time, we will see.<br /><br />The delivery was fast taking into consideration I live in Doha, Qatar. and the package was in good condition.<br /><br />Will keep updating.

review/summary: THIS IS THE REAL DEAL! Ended years of IBS-C suffering
review/text: I tried every possible remedy I could find and nothing gave me consistent results. This product changed my life after 20 years of suffering from IBS-C. I only take one heaping tablespoon a day. I have been using it for about 2 years now and the results are very consistent. I ramped up my dose until I experienced loose stools and then backed off just a little until everything became normal. I am now thinking of breaking it into two smaller doses because the effervescent nature makes me burp like crazy for the first 15 minutes after taking it. But believe me, no matter what, it is worth it. I will most likely take this product for the rest of my life. THANK YOU to the makers.

review/text: I think the great majoority of us are magnesium defficient and I think this is a great way to up you magnesium intake. I do sleep better when I take it and tend to not wake up in the middle of the night.<br /><br />One caution would be to work up to your proper dose. Just don't go and start out with thee heaping teaspons! If you do you will need to keep the location of the nearest restroom in mind. Start at around a teaspoon and work up.<br /><br />This has a pleasant taste and I look forard to taking it in the evening. The container mentions mixing it in warm water and while I tried that I do not find that it is necessary. I just put two heaping teaspoons in a glass, add about six ounces of cool tap water and stir. After the fizzing goes away and it clears up drink it on down.<br /><br />I do recommend the larger sizes as it is more cost effective.

review/text: Needed a sleep aid, The reviews amazed me so I ordered some.  Brought it back with me from the states to Costa Rica.  Finally opened it up, tried it before bedtime, went easy on the quantity due to reviewers suggestions.  Next morning, I did feel like I slept well enough, but the bowels were very active.  So be very easy on the tiny spoonful of it is all I can say.  It takes a lot for me to have loose bowels.  This is like a natural laxative.  I don't use it every night though.  Don't want to worry I need to stay home to be near the toilet.

review/text: Hi, does this supplement make you super thirsty?  I wanted to check because I have been feeling very thirsty especially in the late evening.  It has coincided with me taking this supplement.  But I have heard that excessive thirst is also symptom of diabetes.  Is it documented anywhere that magnesium can result in thirst?  If anyone can share this info, it would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />As for the product, I just started it.  The taste is citrusy.  I have had no side effects other than thirst.  But I don't know how much is psychological I have already been feeling more energy.  I will update if I continue this for a longer time hopefully.

review/text: For the most part, I'll just echo what previous reviewers have said. This stuff is wonderful for putting you to sleep fast, as well as helping with anything to do with muscle relaxation. I've found it helps with both the cramps and mood swings of PMS, and even seems to lessen eye strain headaches. It's also proving invaluable as a way to counteract the rebound insomnia and moodiness of withdrawal from a prescription sleep medication. I take away one star (and would make that a half if I could), because in its raw form (or merely blended with water), it tastes terrible. But mixed with a sweet juice, it's decently palatable.

review/text: This is an excellent source of magnesium which provides a number of health benefits.  Some obvious and some not so obvious.  I have trouble sleeping, waking up many times at night and like everybody else I deal with my fair share of stress.<br /><br />I take a 1/2 teaspoon at night about an hour before bed time along with 5-htp and phenibut powder, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007YY2XQE">5-HTP Powder 10 Grams + FREE Primaforce Phenibut Powder 100 Grams</a>.  I started taking the magnesium long before the 5-htp or anything else, taking them together definitely enhances the mood and sleep stabilizing effects, if that's what your looking for.<br /><br />The Raspberry Lemon flavor doesn't taste delicious but it certainly does not taste bad so it is not a chore what-so-ever to drink a glass each night before going to bed.  Since I've started this nightly ritual nights have become more peaceful, days have become brighter (i.e. tears from stressful situations do not rear their ugly head nearly as much).  I've been happier, plain and simple.

review/summary: This one supplement has changed my life!
review/text: I eat well.  I read a lot of research on health.  I'm a Medline junkie.  I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs.  Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.)<br /><br />None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life.<br /><br />That is, until Natural Calm.<br /><br />This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically!<br /><br />Here are the things this supplement has helped with:<br /><br />Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night.<br />Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed.  Also increased my ability to deal with difficult "crisis" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right??  Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without.  It has made that important an improvement in my life.  It is almost like a miracle.  Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume.  Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume.  In America this ratio is about 4 to 1.  Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1.  I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day.  (Try "The Magnesium Factor" by Margaret Seelig or "The Magnesium Miracle" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two.  You probably won't need that long.  I noticed an improvement in two days.  A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results.  Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want.<br /><br />Here's wishing you great health!

review/summary: Review on TASTE
review/text: I'm writing this review, because it's exactly the kind of review I was looking for before I bought this product, but could not find anywhere.<br /><br />When I first started using Natural Calm I bought it in the Raspberry-Lemon flavor, thinking it sounded the best and used it with water (usually just put it inside a water bottle and shook it up to mix it and drank it that way). Both me and my husband used it and HE really liked the taste, but for me this stuff tasted BAD. I don't know why, but I did not like the taste at all. I guess some people do (obviously my husband did or at least didn't mind it) but I definitely did not. It made drinking it everyday a CHORE.<br /><br />So, this next time I decided to try the one that isn't flavored and I like it SO MUCH better, like a million times better. I just mix it in with my blueberry-pomegranate juice and it's great! It is virtually tasteless and just adds a little 'fizz' to the juice that I actually LIKE. I also put it in teas as well.<br /><br />I wanted to write this review just to let people know that not everyone loves the raspberry-leomon flavor (and I didn't think I'd like the orange to begin with, but haven't tried it yet and probably never will). There are a lot of reviews claiming it tastes great... but for me not so much. I recommend the flavor-less one.<br /><br />Also, be careful when starting out to use the recommendation on the bottle and start with 1/2 a teaspoon a day and then work up from there. :-) I never had any negative side effects, but I guess some people get diarrhia if they take too much in the beginning.<br /><br />This stuff really is amazing and will help you feel GREAT! :-) If you're thinking about trying it don't hesitate. It has many, many benefits. You might just be using it to help with mood or to help with ADHD/concentration, or just for a natural way to keep from becoming constipated... There are MANY benefits. But no matter what you're using it for, it's bound to help out your body and mood in other ways as well! :-) Can't say enough good things about this product! Just try to get the flavor-less one first, it's so much better!! I hated having to drink it when we had the raspberry-lemon one. But now I definitely don't, and like the little fizz it gives my blueberry-pomegranate juice & teas! :-) Drinking it right now and loving it! And loving the way it makes me feel and the concentration it gives me!

review/summary: OMG It WORKS!
review/text: I have been using this product for almost a week now and my only complaint is that I didn't find pit about it sooner! First, a bit about myself. I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess!<br /><br />I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM.<br /><br />Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep!<br /><br />Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too.<br /><br />Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day! I feel so much lighter, my friends and family always said I was full of crap and I guess they were right!<br /><br />I guess after reading my review you are thinking either she is being paid for this or it really works, well it is definitely the latter! It is working for me and I believe it will work for you too, try it what have you got to lose besides a crappy mood, sleepless night, a lot of crap and cramps? Jeez, I think $23.00 is a pretty fair trade off don't you.<br /><br />One more thing the dosage that I am using is two teaspoons at night and one teaspoon in the morning, both with 3 teaspoons of benefiber mixed in  girl still needs her fiber! and BTW it's a store brand). I hope this review helps and if you have any questions please contact me, I am real and this review is real!

review/summary: A major improvement in menopausal symptoms
review/text: I tried this product after researching menopausal heart palpitations and internal tremors on www.power-surge.com.  The relief was immediate!  What surprised me was the improvement in many other aspects of my health.<br />No more headaches that feel like a tight cap binding my scalp.  Reduction of my migraines. No more nightmares (brought on by hormone fluctuations).  No more "internal earthquakes" or buggy-crawling sensations on my skin.  Less anxiety (formerly triggered by hormonal changes). No more weak nails.  Monthly acid reflux greatly reduced, sometimes none at all. Greatly reduced frequency of colds, flus and sinusitus.<br />I chose the Calm with Calcium since I am dairy allergic.  My body assimilates it well, much better than calcium & magnesium pills, which had little to no effect on the above-mentioned problems (in ANY ratio).<br />Overall, I feel much calmer & more energetic.  Not a cure-all, but definitely has raised the quality of my life.<br />I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: " A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!"
review/text: I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try "Natural Calm"; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot.<br /><br />I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because "Natural Calm" does the job.<br /><br />I've been taking "Natural Calm" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff.<br /><br />As for negatives to "Natural Calm"...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick.<br /><br />All in all 5+ stars. "Natural Calm" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer.

review/summary: Great for multiple things
review/text: I originally started taking Calm for the magnesium to help with my Chronic Idiopathic Constipation. I put a couple of teaspoons in hot water and drink a mugful before bed every night and I have been very regular ever since. The taste is almost too sweet but that's probably a perk for some people. It tastes like hot lemonade, nothing chalky about it which is nice. It can be drunk cold but I find that 1) it works better when used with hot water and 2) it tastes better in hot water (cold water doesn't dissolve it well enough and you end up swallowing chunks of the magnesium). Within the first day or two of taking the Calm I realized that not only was I regular but I was sleeping much better. After one mugful, I fall asleep within the hour and also the cramping I was getting in my legs at night has diminished. I started taking this for one reason but realized there are a lot of benefits to it. I will warn you, on the directions it says "add 1oz of water, watch it fizz...", and it FIZZES. I made the mistake of filling my cup with water first and then added the Calm and made an enormous mess! It fizzes up at the slightest splash of water and also when you stir so just do it little by little and you'll be fine :)

review/summary: Natural Calm Magnesium
review/text: I have used this product before in the calcium/magnesium blend. It was suppose to be tasteless.  It wasn't.  It tastes awful.  This lemon-raspberry tastes okay and the product is more reactive when the hot water is added.<br /><br />I was medically advised to take my magnesium in this form because of slipped disks in my back.  This is only one piece of my back program however I can attest to the efficacy of the product.  My disks are no longer slipped.  It has helped me to heal.<br /><br />A bonus benefit for me is that taking the magnesium in this form has stopped the migraines that I have had for 36 years of my life.  I have learned that if a headache begins that I need a dose of Natural Calm.  I was dealing with a magnesium deficiency.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to anyone with muscle or joint issues, migraines,and back issues.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE">Natural Calm Raspberry Lemon Flavor 16oz, Natural Vitality</a>

review/summary: one of the most important minerals for asthmatics
review/text: I've been taking this for over a year before going to bed and have not had any problems going to sleep or staying asleep at night since I've started taking it.  According to the experts, it's one of the most important minerals for asthmatics to take because it relaxes the bronchial tube muscles hence either eliminating or reducing bronchial tightness/restriction.  Although my asthma has been asymptomatic for quite some time, the magnesium is good to use for so many other reasons and to maintain my health.  It's also a natural laxitive and helps prevent indigestion.  This is 100% natural elemental magnesium citrate so there is no need to worry about taking in any strange chemicals as you would when taking a synthetic vitamin supplement.

review/summary: Wouldn't Go Without It
review/text: I've had frequent headaches, muscle cramps, and headaches since I was a child.  I have vivid memories of laying awake into the late hours of the night before exhaustion and sleep would settle in.  When I reached high school, the stress transformed the frequent headaches into occasional migraines.  I treated them for a while with prescription medicine but eventually decided I'd rather live with the pains and adjust in the necessary ways than continue taking medication.  About a year ago, I read an article about Natural CALM and figured `What the heck.'  I was highly doubtful.  I've never been so glad to be wrong.<br /><br />I buy the raspberry-lemon flavor.  To me, it tastes like a bit of raspberry lemonade Crystal Light mixed with an Alka-Seltzer.  I certainly wouldn't drink it just because I'm thirsty, but I can tolerate a 12 oz. glass of it in the evening.  In the beginning, I didn't feel much of a difference.  However, once I started taking about 1 teaspoon - which you have to work up to - I noticed a difference in my quality of sleep.  I kept slowly raising the amount and now use about 2 teaspoons nightly.  I don't find that the CALM makes me fall asleep earlier/faster, but I have found that I don't constantly wake up like I did before.  The nighttime leg cramps have almost completely gone.  And the headaches - the constant pounding and throbbing and aching in my head has diminished to just the occasional headache.  As an added benefit, I seem to deal with stress (especially work stress) much better than I did before.  I tried something else to help with sleep (see below) and, after I stopped taking that, I didn't start taking the CALM again for a little while to see if I could actually tell a difference in the way I felt, slept, and reacted to events.  I did - and so did some others around me!  From now on, I don't plan to go without it.<br /><br />I love this stuff and I turn as many people onto it as I can.  A friend purchased some CALM (the regular flavor:  it worked but tasted pretty bad and made the nightly dose challenging to keep up with) and decided to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N23AE8">SERIPHOS - 100 - Capsule</a> when she ran out of CALM.  While I was visiting, she gave me some to try.  We both found that it gave us the oddest nightmares and made us very groggy/tired in the morning.  My mother, at her doctor's recommendation, started taking a small dose of melatonin to help her get to sleep and stay asleep through the entire night (she'd often get up about 3 AM and couldn't get back to sleep).  Several times after she started taking it, I called her and she slurred her words as if she were taking some sort of narcotic and she wouldn't remember that she'd even spoken to me on the phone.  I sent her a bottle of the orange flavor (she said it tastes ok - like a Sunny D Alka-Seltzer) and she actually adds it to her morning and bedtime cups of decaf orange tea instead of using the melatonin.  She's sleeping like a champ now.<br /><br />If you're considering the purchase, do it!  Like everything, it may not work for everyone, but it's worth a try if you're even thinking about it.

review/summary: Headaches
review/text: I am getting serious headaches from using this product. I know it is supposed to help with migraines but it seems to be having the opposite affect on me. I took 2 teaspoons yesterday and i got a raging headache. Is this too much for the first time? i've been using Mag supplements for years and thought my body would be used to it. Any suggestions or recommendations i would surely love to hear them<br /><br />I still gave this product 4 stars because i think it is great and has huge potential. Like i said i've taken several high quality mag supplements for years and none of them stopped leg cramps and muscle spasms, eye twitches so quickly.It did give me better sleep but not the best but i'm sure that comes with time. The pills i was taking were big horse pills and i didn't take them alot because of the size. I am taking this because of my Vitamin D deficiency that i just can't seem shake, although it's only been 7 months. You have to have Magnesium for Vitamin D to absorb properly. This does loosen your stools some, but i've never had a problem in that area, thank goodness.<br /><br />I am open to suggestions about the dosage. I will wait a few days and maybe start with 1/2 teaspoon ans see how that goes.

review/text: I bought this product, based on many positive reviews, and was not satisfied. I got the original flavor, which I followed the directions while preparing it. First of all, it is vile. My husband tried it also and agreed it is like the taste of acid, and burns the throat just as bad. I purchased this in hopes of getting some relief from my anxiety and also to relieve my IBS. To put it nicely I'm lucky to "poo" twice a week, but when I'm stressed it is non stop. So every week is different. This product boasts its ability to regulate you, as well as to relieve stress and anxiety. I have not found this to be true so far. The taste is hard enough to get over, but it is not the worst part. After drinking it my stomach fills with air to the point that it is painful. I still can't "poo" but my husband will not be pleased tonight while I fart all over him in my sleep. It sounds funny, but it sucks. I gave it two stars only because I seem to be the exception rather than the rule. I am disappointed.

review/summary: Not sure bottle was sealed
review/text: I srewed the top off the bottle without removing the hard plastic pull ring. Makes me wonder if it's safe to use. There is not other covering and I put the cap back on and it looks like it's never been opened! Since it's a powered supplement this doesnt look safe. I gave it a two because of the seal and the fact that I'll probably have to return it.

review/summary: Chemical supplements should be taken based on the advice of a qualified health care provider
review/text: As I have problems with sleep at night and tried all sorts of things which are most commonly recommended to improve it, I tought I try this well rated product. I tried it in all the various recommended dosages. But it didn't make the slightest difference for me. Thus I guess that it probably only works if the cause of the unrest is a magnesium deficiency.<br />Reportedly:<br />"With supplements, overdose is possible, however, particularly in people with poor renal function; occasionally, with use of high cathartic doses of magnesium salts, severe hypermagnesemia has been reported to occur even without renal dysfunction".<br />"Safety Issues<br />The US government has set the following upper limits for use of magnesium supplements:<br />Children<br />1-3 years: 65 mg<br />4-8 years: 110 mg<br />Adults: 350 mg<br />Pregnant or Nursing Women: 350 mg"<br />"It has been called nature's calcium channel blocker."<br />"Magnesium assists in calcium uptake, but it also competes with dietary calcium for the same absorption site in the intestine. Excessive dietary calcium (or phosphorus) is much more likely to block magnesium absorption than vice- versa in the typical American diet. Magnesium absorption is also inhibited by excessive dietary fat, phosphate, lactose, phytates and oxalates which form insoluble compounds with magnesium. Magnesium is also lost in diarrhea, long term use of diuretics, excessive sugar intake and protein malnutrition...<br />...  there are lower levels of minerals in food today due to depletion of the soil in modern farming methods. (23) Modern methods of milling, processing and the preservation of food cause nutrient losses, eg 85% of magnesium is removed from whole wheat in the milling."<br />Thus it is advisable to consult a qualified health care provider if a deficiency is suspected.<br />It's usually best to avoid deficiencies by a healthy diet: "Kelp is very high in magnesium, as are whole grains, almonds, and cashews..."

review/summary: The Best Supplement EVER!!!
review/text: When I read one of the reviews that stated that this supplement changed their life, I was immediately excited because this supplement has changed my life as well!  I started taking this supplement as a part of my diet plan (Ideal Protein).  I took it to help me with bowel movements.  Lucky for me, not only did it improve my bowel movements, it fixed my insomnia problem.  I had insomnia and could not fall into deep sleep for years.  Within 2 weeks of taking this supplement, I was sleeping like a new born baby!  In addition, I became more relaxed and my anxiety completely disappeared!!  It did not stop there...my menstrual cycle is regular now and I no longer have muscle twitches.  TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE!<br /><br />I was soo excited about the improvement in the quality of my life, so I quickly spread the news to all my family and friends.  I worked like wonders for all of my family members.  The results from my friends was a mixed bag.  I think that for the people that have a true magnesium deficiency, this is a miracle supplement.  For those that may not have a true magnesium deficiency, this may not be the magic bullet for them.  I hope that this review was helpful.  I was compelled to spread the word about this supplement because it has truly changed my life!!!

review/summary: Worked on leg cramps, no effect on sleep
review/text: Since starting this powder about 6 weeks ago, I haven't noticed any effect on my sleep, but the number of times I have been woken up by leg cramps (a.k.a. charley horses) has diminished considerably. (I'm pregnant, so both sleep disturbances and leg cramps are common.) As to the taste, the powder mixed with water is not unpleasant and doesn't have much of a taste. I prefer to mix it with water, lemon juice, and pomegranate juice -- it's delicious!

review/summary: Peaceful LIfe
review/text: This is the absolutely best product. I have spent lots of money trying many different products to relax and calm me. The very first time I used it I could tell a huge difference. It relaxes me during the day so I don't feel stressed out. When I take it at night, I sleep great. When my shoulders and neck are tight and tense I take it and it relaxes them. I think this product is expensive...but it is SO worth it.

review/summary: Weird and Amazing!
review/text: I purchased this product because my muscles were very tight. It does a great job relaxing my muscles. The strange thing is, I can't take very much or I have the wildest dreams imaginable. It also makes me tired if I take even so much as a level teaspoon each day.<br /><br />I started taking much less so that I wouldn't have those hyper-realistic dreams. I take 1/8 teaspoon twice a day. Here's the amazing thing. I get these spells of "skipped" heartbeats -- PVCs and PACs. A mere 1/8 teaspoon of this stuff nips it in the bud in minutes! I quit taking the betablockers I have on standby for this problem because this product is so effective.<br /><br />This morning, my husband accidentally made me 16 oz. of caffeinated coffee. Since I have significant issues with anxiety, I *never* drink caffeine. I gulped it down and started feeling incredibly jittery and anxious. When I realized what had happened (and that I wasn't merely going crazy), I took 1/8 teaspoon of Natural Calm. While I still felt hyper-alert, the jitteriness went away entirely.<br /><br />LOVE this stuff, and am so thankful that it is available!
