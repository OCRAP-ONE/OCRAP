review/summary: Chili and calamansi - delicious!
review/text: These noodles are flavorful and zesty thanks to the calamansi (Philippine lemon) in the flavor packet.  They cook up a little oilier than your typical ramen, and they have a slight peanut oil scent without the flavor pack. The chili oil in the mixture might be a little much for some folks, but it's great if you're looking for some variety in your instant ramen repertoire.

review/text: These noodles were actually quite good, but I'd never in a million years order them again, because they made my friend and I very sick instantly after eating. I gave the noodles another chance and they made me sick again. Will not try anything else from this company again either, I've learned my lesson.

review/text: This is pretty much the best value and coolest product available for Tea K-Cups on Amazon. Each K-Cup was 100% unique as advertised! I've drank about 4 or 5 of these so far, and the taste in my opinion is even more robust and full than steeping bags the traditional way! I would recommend this sampler to anyone with a K-Cup maker that loves hot tea. Be sure to pick up some raw honey and fresh lemons before buying this! :)

review/summary: Mighty Tasty and Useful Too
review/text: Recently I had the misfortune to fall off a bus--no laughing is allowed.  To make it worse, I had next to no food in my apartment aside from a box of these Taste Adventure Beans, assorted frozen veggies, rice and tortillas.  A co-worker had given the beans to me to try as they hadn't worked for her "project" (a nacho fund raiser).  Thank goodness for the beans.  One can only eat so many bowls of frozen veggies and rice without going nuts.<br /><br />Once I tasted the beans, I was hooked.  The ingredient list is one that I can get behind:  precooked pinto beans and sea salt.  That's it.<br /><br />I now keep a box in my desk at work for those emergency snacks.  I do doctor my beans with a bit of cumin and chili powder.  And they are great for those week's where I forget to soak beans for my weekly batch of refried beans.<br /><br />Will I be buying more?  Most assuredly.

review/text: Highly recommended! We typically cook 4-6cups of beans in the crock pot over night, but that means you have to clean them, wash them and wait about 8hrs before they are ready and store/freeze them when you are done. We still do that but if need beans on a moments notice these are perfect. Not quite as good as home cooked from scratch but with very very close. I like to keep a couple boxes in the cupboard. For about the same price as canned beans, you can have instant better tasting beans just by adding a little water.

review/summary: Drink Me
review/text: There's nothing like a nice refreshing glass of cool water on a hot day.  However, in damp, foggy San Francisco, I don't necessarily find myself craving as much water as I should ideally drink in a day.  And while I seek some flavor to my beverages, I don't want to indulge in too much sugar, caffine, or calories.  Consequently, I've been addicted to the little powdered drink packets designed to be used with half-liter bottles of water.<br /><br />When I saw this product on the grocery shelf, I immediately wanted to try it.  It has several advantages over the powder packets in my mind.  First, you can flavor any amount of water, whether 8 ounces or 25 ounces.  Also, you don't need a shakeable container with a lid.  Mixing up the MIO beverage can be accomplished with a squirt and a swish.  Finally, you can flavor to taste and make your peach tea a little stronger or weaker as you like it.  All of these anticipated benefits have indeed proven to be true.<br /><br />But what's more important than everything above is taste.  My immediate response to my first taste was, "This tastes like artificial sweetener."  It wasn't the most positive first impression, but as I continued to drink and got used to a new flavor, I found it palatable enough.  Nothing to rave about, but good enough for me to keep drinking.  The peach tea does have a nice tartness to it that I like.<br /><br />As for other pluses and minuses, well, this product is very portable, but it's more likely to spill or leak than a powder packet.  That said, the bottle design seems quite secure, and I'm not especially worried about that happening.  Finally, the bottle promises that it can make up to "24 servings," but you have to read the fine print to see that a serving is 8 ounces, and it's very likely that your beverage serving is considerably larger than that.  So, figure that into your math when you consider the economics of this product.<br /><br />As for me, I like it enough that I'll try a second flavor and see what I think of it.  Happy drinking!

review/summary: Not your mother's peach tea
review/text: First, I feel a bit like a fraud reviewing this as I didn't get it so much for the tea as I did for another use--based on another reviewer's experiences. She found when her bottle was leaking and she left it in the sink, the excess liquid leaking out cleaned her stained sink!<br /><br />So, my feelings about the liquid used as a tea are mixed. Peach isn't my favorite flavor, but I do like a good herbal tea on a hot day. The liquid tea left a bit of a chemical taste and I was unable to get the liquid tea vs. amount of water right to where I was satisfied. It seemed either too weak or too strong.<br /><br />The reason I ordered this product was more to do with cleaning the tile in my shower. I had let my grandchildren use the washable crayons on the tile and still can't get some of the crayon off. So I dabbed on some of the liquid full strength. It didn't get the crayon off, but wow did it clean the white tiles to a shine. Where I scrubbed the crayon markings, the tile shone (well it still had the crayon markings), but the areas where the tea had been brushed on that I wiped down were also clean. I looked at the ingredients and am not sure which one is doing the cleaning, but it was impressive.<br /><br />A little expensive for a shower cleaner, but it might be worth it on stubborn stains.<br /><br />So therefore I am giving the product three stars. One star for tea and five for a shower cleaner! The average is three.

review/summary: A refreshing twist on water, conveniently carried
review/text: I've been drinking a lot more water these days than soda, which does save money and has to be healthier for you, but water does get boring. I was given the chance to try the MiO Peach Tea flavor, and I found I really like it. The first time I squirted it, I missed my glass, so be sure you aim it straight down where you want it to go!<br /><br />Like so many other food products these days, MiO does depend on chemical sweeteners (for 0g of everything), so I don't think I would be using a lot of it. But just a little squirt perks up cold water really well. A good thing, too, is the fact that you can cut down on your use of plastic by using MiO for your flavoring. Just ask for water at a restaurant or fill your bottle from the water fountain, squeeze in a little, and voila! The MiO bottle is about the size of a laptop mouse, so it will easily tuck into a bag or pocket.

review/summary: Watch out!
review/text: The directions say to use one sqeeze for each 8 oz of water.  Not knowing how it came out of the container, I didn't tip it completely upside down over my glass when I gave it a gentle squeeze.  Boy, did it ever squirt out! All over me and outside my glass!  So, a word of advice, it doesn't come out of the container until you squeeze it, so definitely turn it upside down before squeezing.<br /><br />I am a water drinker and try to avoid caffeine.  I do, however, enjoy having a little flavor in my drink, occasionally.  I am limited in my choices.  I had seen the ads for Mio and had picked it up in the store, but didn't see whether or not there was any caffeine.  The description I read on Amazon said there was none, so I decided to take a chance.  I also liked the no calorie part.<br /><br />Once I had the Mio in the glass of water, I was able to try it out.  I started with one squeeze and stirred it up.  The color was very pale, for tea.  The smell was peachy, but not like a real peach.  More like a peach fragrance in a lotion or candle.  The taste was pretty weak, so I put in another squeeze.  The smell and taste was now stronger and the color was a light pinky-brown.  The taste is pretty artificial.  Tastes like there are a lot of chemicals used to achieve this taste.  there is a label, which did not pull off cleanly, over my ingredients list, but from what I can see, there is a good reason it tastes like chemicals.

review/text: This comes in a portable bottle that will fit in your pocket. Pocket flavor for on the go. Add to your water bottle or anywhere use to add to glass of water. MIO makes it easy to limit those extra calories from sodas, high sugar drinks or to stay on diabetic low sugar diet. Reminds me of those peach teas that you get as an option in resturants.  This does not leave any nasty after taste when swallowed, so you can enjoy a low calorie fruit tea without a nasty after taste.

review/summary: MIO Liquid Peach Tea
review/text: First of all, the packaging of MIO is cool! Well designed and thought out, easy to carry and no drips when you use it.<br />However, the Peach Tea has a very off putting smell when you open it. It smells exactly like chlorinated pool water. I decided to give it a try despite the smell. One squirt in a 20 oz bottle of water gave a very, very light taste, mostly chemical in flavor. A second squirt made it sweeter, and gave it a Kool Aid type peach taste, but no tea flavor at all. A third squirt made it undrinkable, sickeningly artificially sweet. Blech!

review/text: I did not care for the Sweet Tea and Mango Peach MIO's, you can see my reviews on those.<br /><br />I generally like Crystal Light and other additives to bottled water to break up the boredom of drinking water. The other two flavors of MIO that I tried, I did not care for. However the Peach Tea was much better. Start off light on this, taste it and adjust one drop at a time. You can go from 'not strong enough' to WHOA that's too much, in a hurry.<br /><br />The only con with this, like the other MIO's, was that I still get that slimy 'snails in the mouth' aftereffect when drinking it, and I can't figure out why. It makes my mouth feel oily.

review/summary: Good flavor, exceptional convenience
review/text: I have tried various flavors of Mio in the past, and they are usually hit or miss for me.  I really enjoy the Fruit Punch, but that might just be because I was raised on the sugar-free version of Kool-Aid.  My daughter loves the sweet tea, which remains one of my least favorite flavors.<br /><br />I had the opportunity here to try Mio's Peach Tea, and I have to say that this one's pretty much a winner.  Here in Texas we take sweet tea seriously, and while this cannot hold a candle to genuine brewed sweet peach tea, it's about as tasty as you can possibly get from squeezing liquid into a bottle of water.  The peach flavor is bold but not overpowering.  I was pleased to taste that the artificial sweetness of the Sweet Tea flavor was not present in this variation.  In fact, I would have to rank this pretty close to Fruit Punch as my favorite Mio variety.<br /><br />Beyond taste, you simply cannot beat the convenience factor.  I hate ordering my toddler a separate tea/soda at restaurants when she's eating off an adult plate, yet she absolutely hates drinking water with her meal.  So we have found Mio to be a wonderful compromise.  A little squirt of the "Magic Fruit Punch" (that seems to be her name for Mio, regardless of the flavor), and she's as happy as if I had ordered her a kid's drink.  That saves me a dollar or so per meal, so this little container pays for itself quickly.<br /><br />If you hate water but know you need to drink it, or if you just want a little something more after a walk or workout (without the added calories), or if you or your kids want to save a few bucks when dining out, Mio is pretty wonderful.  Recommended.

review/summary: No side effects yet
review/text: A few drops of MiO caused the water in my glass to turn brownish red. I tasted it. A somewhat pleasant bitter-sweet, vaguely hinting at Cr&egrave;me Br�l&eacute;e or maybe just burned sugar. I forced myself to finish the glass and, 24 hours later there were no side effects other than some mild aftertaste that slowly faded away and changed into more bitter and less sweet. I must disclose that I haven't submitted myself to a thorough medical exam yet.<br /><br />My review sample had a sticky label over the contents disclosure but patience goes a long way. This is what I learned after I removed the sticky: this product contains mostly... nothing. 0 calories, 0% fat, 0% sodium, 0% carbs, 0% protein. It has no or only trace amounts of cholesterol, fiber, saturated fat, transfats, Vitamin C, Calcium or Iron.<br /><br />Then... what is this tea made of? According to the ingredients list, the main ingredient besides 'water' is Propylene Glycol. It's worth checking it out on the Wiki because it's a very useful chemical. They have a long list of good uses there including as a: solvent used in mixing photographic chemicals, working fluid in hydraulic presses, the main ingredient in deodorant sticks, the killing and preserving agent in pitfall traps and to capture ground beetles, cooling agent for beer and wine glycol jacketed fermentation tanks and so many other useful activities such as to regulate humidity in a cigar humidor.<br /><br />All of this is great because, like I said, one day later I'm still okay and smell like a rose or... Cr&egrave;me Br�l&eacute;e? - the deodorant effect- but... where's the tea? I am going to grant this product 2 stars because, after I consumed it in moderation (one glass) it did not make me sick.

review/text: I love flavored tea (my favorite is the Chili's strawberry flavor, just to give you an idea of the flavor I like), so I thought I'd give this a try.  It's a really neat idea and the bottle is small enough to fit in your pocket, a small purse, or your car console.  It has zero calories, sugar, etc., so it is a diet drink and tastes like it no matter how much or little you use.  The one thing I really don't like about it is that it does not drip out in small drops, you squeeze it and the least that you can squeeze out is about a full tablespoon, which means your water really can't ever taste like water with a touch of flavored tea, it tastes like watered down flavored tea.  I was hoping you could do smaller drops to get more of a light flavored water taste, but it doesn't work that way.

review/summary: Artificial tasting chemical concotion from Kraft
review/text: If you're looking for all-natural refreshment, please move along. This product is not made with real tea or peach juice, despite having "peach tea" in the name. The front of the item says "natural flavor with other natural flavor." Natural what? I really don't know. Whatever natural flavor is in here is less than 2% and is not specified. The rest is dyes, artificial sweeteners, and preservatives: propylene glycol, potassium sorbate, red 40, blue 1, yellow 5, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. It has zero calories, but is having all that junk inside your body worth the trade-off? It doesn't even taste good. The undiluted liquid smells somewhat like paint (from the proplyene glycol, a form of alcohol).<br /><br />The egg-shaped bottle is cute and convenient to carry, but I'm concerned about all the additives. The bottle is type-7 plastic, which is non-recyclable in many municipalities (only 1 and 2 are recyclable in my city). Not recommended. Seek healthier alternatives, or just drink plain water instead.

It does add variety and flavor, but I'm not sure if the flavor is anything I ever want to taste again.  To me, it makes water taste worse than it naturally does.<br /><br />The only way to make this product the slightest bit enjoyable, for me, is to heavily dilute it.  When you use half or less than the recommended quantity, it kind of accomplishes the intent of giving water a unique flavor, similar to the effect of adding a few jobs of fruit juice.<br /><br />If taste wasn't such a subjective thing, I would probably only give this product 1 star.  Even though I don't like the way that it tastes, you might.

review/summary: Tastes good and is easy to take with you, cost is slightly high
review/text: Mio is a concentrated water enhancer that doesn't need to be refrigerated and can easily be taken anywhere. I like that I can take it with me on the road and turn any water into flavored water. I have never liked to drink plain tap water but with some Mio it's much better. Each bottle is said to last 24 servings but it will change depending on your personal taste preference. One serving is a brief squirt or � teaspoon of Mio.  It's doesn't have any calories or carbs which is important to me because I am trying watch my weight. I like the taste of it but I mainly taste peach and don't really taste tea in the flavor. Maybe I would taste it more if I would use more than one serving in my glass but I prefer the lighter taste. I haven't noticed any aftertaste with this product so far. The cost seems high for such a small bottle but it will flavor 192 oz. of water so it's not so bad considering that.

review/summary: Convenient and Love the Peach Tea!
review/text: I'm a big fan of Crystal Light Peach Tea and this tastes the same to me. It comes in a convenient concentrated liquid so you just mix the amount that you want right into water whether a glass or a bottle of water. To me it's easier to use and better than the Crystal Light individual powder packs, those have always been hard to mix and not ever the exact amount for the water I'm drinking. MIO can be added just a little or a lot to customize to your taste preference. I found it to be convenient for bottled water and for taking to restaurants so I can order water and add my own flavoring. The liquid is just much easier to mix than powdered versions. I like the taste so much though that I have found that I'm just adding it to water around the house too. To me, there is no off taste or after taste.

review/summary: My spouse and son use this almost daily, compact and very portable
review/text: If the price of this product leaves you gasping, it shouldn't. It is highly concentrated and my spouse uses it to create flavored water when plain water isn't appealing. It goes a long way. With so many Mio flavor choices, even if you don't like the peach you ought to find others you enjoy. But the peach MIO is one of our favorites.<br /><br />I do think it is important to note that reviewers tend to either love or hate this product so you might want to check out a number of reviews. But for the record, we love it, have purchased more after getting a free sample, and keep a regular supply on hand.<br /><br />Mostly we use this as an alternative to soft drinks and it fits nicely into our diet plan, making it easier to avoid weight gain, although we also exercise and eat a balanced diet (most of the time) . Sometimes we add this to Kefir, especially when flavored Kefir is unavailable.<br /><br />Even if you can find flavored Kefirs, they often contains plenty of sugar so the Mio is an excellent way to add taste without boosting sugar levels.<br /><br />If you have limited space, each container takes up very little room in your cabinets. This also makes it highly portable, adding minimal weight. The container can even be put in a backpack or purse....and no, the top doesn't open easily.<br /><br />We also keep a few of these in our desks while at work. At his university, our student son uses it to flavor fizzy water. You can even get more than the 24 servings noted on the container, depending on your taste. We do use enough to have a strong taste so it doesn't last as long but sometimes we can stretch it a bit. It really depends on what food or drink you flavor and how much satisfies your taste buds.<br /><br />About that taste....the peach Mio has a nice, fruity tang, very full-bodied. For those reviewers who complain about the after taste, we get around that issue by using just enough to avoid that problem. It is really that simple.Tweak the amount you use and see if that doesn't prevent any unpleasant after taste.<br /><br />If you keep in mind how much space the average bottle of water of water or soda needs, this is a far better choice. For small apartments, dorm rooms, and tiny office cubicles, you can't beat this for convenience and a tiny footprint. Even when added to tap water instead of bottled or fizzy water, there is a noticeable improvement if you want some variety in the beverages you drink.

review/summary: Bad after-taste
review/text: Okay, I really wanted to like this product.  I tried and tried, but hated it every time, no matter how much or little I used in my water.  Love the concept - a small container that travels easily and has very little packaging, but that just doesn't make up for an unpleasant taste!  I found it very hard to measure a consistent amount, because it doesn't "drip" out (thereby you could at least count the drips).  You have to squeeze it, and guess how much you are putting in. And each squeeze delivers a different amount.  Very annoying.  I have used competing products on a regular basis (the powdered stuff that comes in single packets), and since I enjoy almost any brand of those, I figured I would probably like this stuff.  Wrong.  This product has an "off" taste, and leaves a very bad aftertaste in your mouth.  It's a very "chemical" taste, and just not enjoyable.  In fact, it made me nauseous most of the time.  It was so bad, I ended up throwing this away before finishing the bottle.  They get one star for clever packaging and clever concept.

review/summary: Great for what it is
review/text: I live in the heart of the peach district, in the second largest peach=producing state, most years. We make peach tea with real, fresh, tree-ripened peaches. This is not that. It is a tasty beverage--very useful when you are traveling to doctor water that is not the best-tasting, or just to make a refreshing diet beverage on the go--you can slip this in your purse or shirt pocket (well, my dad does, anyway), and you're good to go. The best thing, for me, is that I can easily control the strength of the drink--I usually dilute Crystal light to half strength because it's just too sweet for me--here I can add one drop instead of two and get just the right strength to flavor a bottle of water or large glass of water.

review/summary: Could be peachier.
review/text: The idea of carrying a neat little container of liquid that allows me to turn a bottle of water into peach tea is good. I was excited to try it. It takes more product than I expected to get the results though. I'm accustomed to the more exciting peach tea flavor of instant sugar free tea that comes in a jar. One more negative thought: it seems a little expensive.<br /><br />One of the positives is that it contains malic acid, a product which, according to a physiatrist who used to treat me, relieves the pain of fibromyalgia. Malic acid does indeed seem to help the muscle aches.

review/text: It's just okay. I don't dislike it, but I don't love it. I like the idea of Mio. It's easy to carry in my purse so I can use it to flavor my water at work. It's much handier than the little powder packets and you can add as much flavor as you want. Not to mention, you don't have the powder flying up in your face when you pour it. It's easy to control. It won't leak out when you tip the bottle. You have to squeeze for any liquid to come out. I heard that fruit punch is the best flavor and may try it sometime. I like Mio because flavoring my water gets me to drink more water and Mio contains 0 calories.

review/summary: This tasted so incredibly good. I loved it!
review/text: I really like peach flavor, so I was worried that this would taste too much like tea. I could only taste the peach, and I couldn't taste the tea. It's also not caffeinated, so I'm not sure what they mean by "tea." I'm also really super weird. I like the smell of bleach, and chlorine, and this tastes like peach plus what I'm guessing bleach would taste like, if it tasted good. (I've never actually tasted bleach.) So, you might not like this, but you really should try it.<br /><br />This is the first MIO that I've tried, and I really like the container. It does make enough for 24 small glasses, even though I made about 12 big glasses with mine. I like how it mixes a little bit without having to stir it, but you could stir it if you wanted.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+I love this flavor<br />+Peach flavor<br />+Great concept of choose your own drink intensity<br />+Clean way of mixing your own drink<br />+Very sturdy packaging<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Not everyone will love this flavor, as it's pretty unique

review/summary: You had me at Caffeine Free!
review/text: I love tea, and I love flavored teas.  Unfortunately, I can't have caffeine, and finding fruit teas in decaf is not easy.  So a major plus for this product is that it's decaf.<br /><br />But a bad-tasting decaf tea is as bad as no decaf at all.  Thankfully, this tastes very good.  The real benefit to MIO is that you can add as much or as little flavoring as you want to get the taste you want.  You can also use it in any size container/glass that you want -- no longer are you limited to 20 oz. bottles and full flavor packets.<br /><br />The individual MIO bottles are also easy to carry with you, either in a purse or pocket, even in a lunch box or tote bag.  It's easy to use (and share).  Just one warning -- be careful of how much you put in, especially when you first use it.  Remember that you can always add more, but once it's in the water you can't get it back out!!

Other members of my family also tried it, to see if it was just a taste thing I lack, and no one liked it enough to take a second sip. The flavor reminds me of the smell of a sweaty steam sauna.

My husband and kids both like the packets of peach tea mix that you can add to 20 oz bottles of water to make a tea-like drink.  I thought the MIO liquid would be a nice way to provide the same type of drink.  It wasn't.  It was horrible.  I do not recommend it at all.  Yuk.  Even when we added more, trying to make it taste less like weakly flavored water and more like tea, it just got worse and worse. Do not waste your money.

review/summary: Peach, yes. Tea?
review/text: I drink a lot of water [96oz+] daily for the health benefits and grew up on Crystal Light because of my mom. I consider this product the 2012 version of Crystal Light [and my mom loves this product too - go figure.] This lightly or strongly flavors your water depending on how much you squirt it. I prefer the light flavor in my Nalgene bottle, which still requires a significant "squirt" for the 32oz bottle.<br /><br />The taste of this product is good, but I don't know how they figure this is peach tea. I can taste the peach flavor, but not the tea. Which is not a bad thing, as I am not the biggest fan of tea "flavor" as opposed to brewed tea. I like this flavor, I would buy it again, as I think it is one of the better flavors. However, I don't love the Mio product, I don't need it to drink my water, but if it's on sale I would buy to put in my water occasionally.

review/summary: Not appealing
review/text: I am a Crystal Light peach tea fan so I was anxious to try this. My gold standard is Snapple diet peach.  Crystal light relatively closely approximates that.<br /><br />It seemed like Mio it would be convenient to use.<br /><br />First I had trouble with the packaging.  It was hard to appropriately tear the plastic cover off.  I also had trouble with the directions.  I am 49 and my near vision is going the way most people in their 40s goes... I can't read the directions without finding reading glasses.  Could the manufacturers possibly consider their over-40 customers valuable and print just a little bigger?!<br /><br />My first squirt of the liquid went past the glass.  Ok.  So that will only happen once but..  Although mixing crystal light powder doesn't bother me and I am sure this is a liquid version of something similar, squirting the brown liquid into the water was not appetizing.  I felt like it was a chemistry experiment.<br /><br />When I drank the tea, I continued to think of it as a chemical experiment.  It tasted "chemically"  Again, just not appealing.  I admit I may have been influenced by the "squirting in" process.<br /><br />It is not something I will buy again.  I will stick to Crystal Light and Snapple.

review/summary: Pleasant enough peachy taste
review/text: I tried this drink this past week, just putting one squeeze into 8 ounces of water at first. The colored liquid didn't seem to be dissipating, so I stirred with a straw. When I took a drink, it was a very light, subtle peach flavor. Pleasant. After I drank about half the glass, I had to try another squeeze to see what it would do. Better.<br /><br />I appreciated the seal at the top of the bottle, which when you tear it, twirls around the bottle until you reach the perforation. Regarding the instructions, though: Wasn't sure what "Flip It" meant at first -- was I supposed to shake the bottle? (I did.) But it means flip the lid of the bottle. Of course, from a marketing perspective, I understand the need to be catchy / pithy! The "click it twice to lock tight" instruction on the label is also interesting -- normally, the user would just close the lid, which is what you do here, and perhaps not notice that there are two clicks. If you do just one click, it's obvious it's not closed all the way.<br /><br />I appreciate that it's sugar-free with no calories, along with caffeine-free. For sweetening, it uses Splenda (sucralose) rather than Nutrasweet (aspartame), which I also appreciate.

The obvious advantage is that you can create how much flavor as you want.  Although billed as without sugar whatever is used I found to be too saccharine, even at the most modest level.  Again, if you're used to the taste of artificial sweeteners you might want to give this a try.

review/summary: Great flavor enhancer for your water!
review/text: I struggle to drink enough water, so I'm always looking for ways to make it taste better. Those powder drink packets are great, but what if your cup is larger or smaller than the recommended size? You can try to adjust amounts, but it's hard to guess just right.<br /><br />Enter MiO. It's a liquid, and you can squirt as little or as much as you want into your water. It diffuses through the water rapidly (no shaking, stirring, or globs of undissolved powder). It may take one or two tries to get the right amount of flavoring for your water, but after that, it becomes pretty easy to eyeball it.<br /><br />The taste is similar to Crystal Light's Peach Tea. I've tried a couple other MiO flavors, too, but Peach Tea is definitely my favorite. It has become my go-to water enhancer--I go through one bottle a month at work.<br /><br />MiO is a great product that I highly recommend!

review/summary: too "artificial" tasting for my tastes
review/text: Like many others, I am trying to give up sodas and drink more water.  In the past I have used the crystal light drink add-ins with mixed results, so when I saw this product I wanted to give it a try.  I like the concept of the liquid flavoring, that would eliminate the problem of the powders not dissolving all the way.  In addition, the bottle would allow the user to add as little or as much of the flavoring as he/she would like, for a customized beverage.<br /><br />With all of that in mind, I had high hopes for this product, and I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed once I actually used the product.  First, the bottle states to use "two drops" of flavoring for a 16 oz bottle of water.  I did use two drops, and aside from making a slight change in the color of the water, there was no change to the flavor of the water.  I took another bottle of water and added two "squirts" of flavoring to the water, and the results were more dramatic.  I must first add that fortunately for me, I did not experience the "chemically" or "bleach" smell that others seem to have experienced with this product.  What I did smell was the strong smell of "artificial" peach scent.  The scent immediately reminded me of a peach candle - that is to say very strong and artificial.  Despite the smell, I started to drink and while the flavor of the drink (while drinking it) wasn't too bad, it did leave an aftertaste in my mouth that I did not care for.  Also, bringing the bottle to my mouth caused my nose to be assaulted by the fake-peach smell again.  Try as I might, I was not able to finish that bottle.<br /><br />In order to provide an accurate appraisal of the product, I experimented more with the flavoring, slowly adding more drops (but less than the two squirts) until a more acceptable scent was acheived.  The first thing I determined is that there is no way to acheive as many bottles of flavored water as the package states.  Most people would have to use twice as much (at the minimum) to get any kind of flavor at all, which greatly reduces the amount of water you can flavor from one bottle.  Unfortunately, even with less flavoring, there was still a lingering after-taste.  I have talked with friends of mine who like the MIO products, and they have suggested that maybe it is the "tea" part of the flavoring that is leaving the after-taste, as they have not had that problem with other flavors of the product.<br /><br />Overall, I am disappointed that this product did not live up to my expectaions.  Although I know of people who use and like this flavoring, I am not sure I will be purchasing any additional flavors.  The cost of this item in grocery stores is somewhat high, and I am hesitant to purchase a 4-pk from Amazon in the event that I won't use them.  The overpowering smell, as well as the after-taste from the flavoring has led me to determine that I will be best served by continuing to use crystal light.<br /><br />UPDATE*******<br />While my rating of the peach tea remains the same, armed with a high value coupon I did purchase another flavor of MIO - this time the strawberry-watermelon flavor, and I was very pleased with the results.  I will be posting a review for that item later.

I've bought several more vials since trying this one, and have been carrying it regularly in my purse. I like it a bit stronger than the label suggests, which means it doesn't make quite as many servings as expected, but it's still far cheaper than buying a bottle of anything when you want a flavored beverage. I also like it better than the packets I'd tried before, because it won't accidentally rip open in my purse. (I do still use the packets at work on occasion, where they can stay safely in my desk drawer.)<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this product, and even this specific flavor.

review/summary: Ok if you like artificial tea flavor
review/text: First of all, the bottle is just downright cute.  It's not very big--easily stored as it doesn't take up much space.  You can even take it with you because there is an extra precaution they take to make sure the bottle is sealed.  If you read the directions, you must hear two clicks to make sure it's closed properly.  It's also a nice concept, this liquid water enhancer.  The only other flavor I've tried is the Mango Peach which, to me, tastes much better.  I've always disliked artificial tea flavors and this product is no exception.  If you like Nestea or other powdered tea drinks, you would like this product as well.  It is the same type of flavor but in a liquid form.  It's also sugar-free.<br /><br />I give this product 2 stars because of my dislike for artificial teas.

review/summary: Unpleasant After Taste
review/text: The idea of having a liquid concentrated peach tea is great since there's no need to mess with powders. It's simply squirt in the amount you want, stir or shake, and it's ready to drink.<br /><br />I've tried the other MIO flavors, like Mango, and it is much more tastier than this peach tea. This one leaves a chemical after taste, like really strong artificial sugar. I tried using less liquid peach tea and more water and even when it's diluted, the nasty after taste is there.<br /><br />Great idea, but avoid the peach tea flavor. Perhaps try the mango peach tea one.

review/summary: Bitter Aftertaste
review/text: I love the packaging and idea behind this product, just not the flavor. I tried it in water with just a few drops and a bunch, but every time I got a lingering artificial sweetener bitterness. I will say that the squirt action on these bottles is very cool and works quite well for controlling the amount you add.

review/summary: Convenient packaging, refreshing taste
review/text: The MiO peach flavor has a nice refreshing taste. I often drink peach tea and I didn't taste a lot of tea in this but the peach was definitely there. Once I got a feel for squeezing the right amount into the water bottle it tasted good. Add too much and there is an aftertaste, don't add enough and it's too bland.<br /><br />Previously I had used powdered or liquid packets for flavoring. Having a liquid but in a bottle is very convenient, much easier to use and allows me to add just the right amount for the size water bottle I'm using. Also, the packaging is very nice. I tossed it in my bag to take along and it didn't leak or open, the top snaps shut and the bottle is spill proof.

review/summary: A Decent Flavor Option
review/text: I am a water drinker, it is my drink of choice, but occasionally I like a little flavor. The Peach Tea flavored Mio is a really good option for adding just that little touch of flavor to my water without overpowering it. I would have given the flavor 5 stars if there was a little more "tea" in my "peach tea" flavored Mio. The flavor is a strong peach flavor only slightly tampered by any tea flavoring. It is much better than the Mango Peach flavor, which I also tried, in that it's not nearly as overly sweet as the Mango Peach.

review/summary: Too sweet and unrefreshing
review/text: My first impression is that this product is just another way to sell artificial sweetener. I tried 2 flavors and the overwhelming characteristic is sweetness. Some may like this, but I do not. The main drawback, though, is the flavoring is not very complex. What I mean is that there is a narrow range of flavor receptors working on your tongue when you drink it. Cast in this mixture of sweetness is a single flavor, it seems. It is not complex; you clearly taste just 2 things: sweetness and a specific flavor.<br /><br />If you enjoy drinking something that is refreshing and/or interesting, this isn't it. For example, if you add a freshly squeezed lemon and some sugar to your water, your whole mouth seems to pick up a range of flavors and sensations that leaves a slight, but satisfying aftertaste. The MiO, on the other hand, hits your tongue with a strong blast of sweetness and flavor, disappears, then leaves an aftertaste lingering on the back of your tongue of that vague, yet strangely familiar taste all artificial sweeteners seem to have.<br /><br />There are better ways to flavor water, I'm afraid, than this.

review/text: The bottle MIO comes in is great--small enough for pocket or purse, and it doesn't seem to leak--but I wasn't thrilled with the taste when using plain water. It's peachy enough, but I really couldn't taste any tea. I far prefer it, however, when using it to flavor tea instead. In this way, I'm able to enjoy TRUE "peach tea."  I suggest using it creatively to flavor things other than water, and you'll probably be a lot happier with it.

review/summary: Goldilocks and the Peach Tea
review/text: Peach tea is a favourite of mine, and Mio Liquid Peach Tea gets it right. The flavour is crisp and clean, very refreshing with no weird aftertaste. It makes for an excellent drink when mixed right.<br /><br />And therein lies the tricky part.<br /><br />Mixing Mio is pretty simple - a few quick squirts of Mio into a glass or a bottle, add water and drink. A "squirt," however, can be variable, and its a process of trial and error to find the right mix for you. It's fun to experiment, but it does end up feeling a little like that old fairy tale - this one's a little too weak, that one a little too strong...oh, this one's just right!<br /><br />And when it's just right, Mio Peach Tea is a drink I'll definitely want more of.

review/text: I was skeptical about the Mio Peach Tea flavor, because it's hard to get a natural-tasting peach flavor out of anything but a really ripe peach (I used to have a cheesecake biz and wrestled unsuccessfully with a peach cheesecake that never had enough peach flavor without my coating it in peach preserves!). Two quirts of this stuff and I am a believer! It really is flavorful and tastes JUST like peach tea, without the sugar, calories or caffeine (I can't have caffeine). My teenager hates plain water, so the Mio will help me get more water into him. And it's awesome because we can customize the taste based on personal preferences and how big the glass or water bottle is. It's a small package and could easily fit into a desk drawer at work too. Yummy!! We're hooked.

review/summary: Fresh peaches
review/text: Are you a peach lover?  Then this is the drink mixer for you!<br /><br />I put two small squeezes into a 16 oz. bottle of water and it gave a good but not overpowering flavor of fresh peaches.  It didn't make me think I was drinking peach flavored tea but rather fresh peach juice.  I know it says tea in the name but I decided to try adding it in my plain tea anyway.  It tasted pleasantly of peaches as well.<br /><br />It comes in a plastic squeeze bottle with a snap closure.  No refrigeration is needed so you can take it to work or put it in your car to use whenever you want a refreshing peach drink.  Since it is caffeine-free and has no calories or sugar, it is a sure way to have flavor while watching your weight.  At 1.62 oz. per package, it says it will flavor 24 bottles but I'm betting I will get more than 24 bottles out of it!

review/summary: Decent, But Not Really Special...
review/text: I regularly drink herbal iced teas at home, but I also bring powdered flavor packets and bottled water to drink at work.  I much prefer the flavor of real iced tea, but flavored water can be a good convenient and cost effective drink while away from home.  The MIO flavoring is a good concept for flavoring water easily since you don't have to deal with messy powders  (which often seem to spill and go everywhere), but it has some flaws that keep it from being a great product.<br /><br />I have tried two different flavors of MIO, and those were the Mango Peach and the Peach Tea.  The Peach Tea is much better than the Mango Peach (which is unbearably acidic).  As far as taste goes, it's pretty good for a drink flavoring, but about on par with various powdered flavor packets I've tried.  This wouldn't be a bad option if it were pretty cost-effective...<br /><br />So, let's talk price.  These things are not cheap.  They are about $5 a piece and even though they flavor multiple drinks, I ended up having to use two whole squirts to get it to an acceptable flavor level.  This is more than their recommended amount of one squirt.  So, really, the value is not that great here.  However, if you are interested in MIO despite its price, just try the Peach Tea one because it was the best tasting of the two I tried.

review/text: I don't know that water really needs "enhancing" but sometimes a little blast of flavor is nice.  With no carbs, calories or fat, this product breaks the just plain water monotony.<br /><br />Packaged in a nifty little bottle, it is easy to use.  Just flip the cap, tip into your beveage and squeeze, one or two squeezes does the trick. Click the top back on to secure.  Despite the lack of natural ingredients, the flavor was pleasantly peachy.  It was not too sweet and I did not notice any heavy chemical aftertaste.  I have tried it in water, plain seltzer water for a nifty peach soda, iced tea and hot tea.  The flavor provided a nice change.  The bottle is small enough to pop into a backpack or purse and when closed properly does not leak.  I wish this item was all natural but even so, I will keep a bottle on hand just for a change of pace.

review/summary: It's like Crystal Light, as a liquid with flexible portions
review/text: If you like Crystal Light Peach Tea, you'll like MIO peach tea.  Personally, I can't discern a taste difference between the two.  Where this product is different, however, is in portions.  The Crystal packets are one-size-fits-all, made for a 1/2 liter water bottle.  If your bottle is 20 ounces, you'll get a weaker tea.  If you have an 8 or 12 ounce glass, good luck estimating half or 3/4 of a packet to match your water volume.<br /><br />The MIO container, on the other hand, is good for any size portion, though it may take some practice to master it.  One average squeeze of the teardrop is good for 8 ounces, two for a half-liter, and so on.  Each person's squeeze is variable, so you'll need to get the hang of how much works for you, and for how strong you like your tea.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it's hard to tell when the teardrop container is on it's last squeeze.  I ended up with a bottle with 20 ounces of water and enough tea concentrate for about 12 - very weak tea, indeed, and a waste.

review/text: I'm trying real hard to kick the diet soda habit. When I heard about Mio, I figured the flavor enhancer would be a great way to get me to drink more water.<br /><br />There is no big issue or secret to making Mio peach tea. Add a few drops and gently stir and you've got a glass of peach tea. Best of all, no sugar added and my caffeine-intolerant husband can even drink Mio's peach tea.<br /><br />The tea tastes great at first.  I found the taste was pleasant without being too surgary for me.  But before finishing small 8 oz glass of the tea, I started tasting an after- taste, which isn't pleasant.<br /><br />The Mio does work as advertised and is a great way to drink more water, but you're going to have to rinse out your mouth if a stale after-taste bothers you.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, November 2011

review/text: MiO's Liquid Peach is a low-to-no-calorie mixer.  Mixing a squirt or two of it with an 8 to 16 oz. glass of water creates the equivalent of what I'll call "peach water."  While that tastes fine, mixing in more liquid makes the drink stronger than I prefer.  The peach flavor, however, is a nice change from water with lime or lemon and doesn't require me to wring the juice out of a peach.  Worth a try.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4CCSQ">MiO Liquid Peach Tea</a> is a very clever product, a squeeze bottle of sweeteners and coloring agents that can transform water into peach tea with only a squirt. While I appreciate the design and portability of the bottle and can see many applications for it (especially for busy parents), the proof of the "enhanced water" is in the drinking... and, while refreshing, I did not enjoy the flavor.<br /><br />Although it says "natural flavor with other natural flavor" on the label, this tasted particularly artificial to me, better than store brand instant iced tea mix but nowhere near as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E52VR0">Crystal Light Peach Tea</a>. While some would surely appreciate the taste adjustment afforded by a squeeze bottle - add as much or as little as you like - I found it difficult to make a consistent glass, sometimes making it too weak, other times sickly sweet and cloying.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you like other MiO flavors, you may very well like this one. It wasn't my cup of tea.

review/summary: I prefer other flavors, but great idea
review/text: Mio Peach Teach Water Flavoring comes in a handy small package that lets you instantly add sugar-free, calorie-free flavor to any water. You can use it at work, at the gym, on the road, you name it.<br /><br />The small plastic container - about the size of a deck of cards - has a snap-tight lid and holds 24 servings of flavoring. To add flavor to water you simply open up the lid, squirt in the flavoring, and stir or shake the water. The liquid quickly dissolves /spreads throughout the water and gives it a flavor.<br /><br />The peach tea flavor is a bit odd to me. I really liked the mango peach flavor, but here it tastes more artificial. It tastes almost cloyingly sweet, even at a light level. However, I'm sure some people like that kind of flavor. Also, since you are the one mixing it up, you can make the flavor as strong or light as you wish.<br /><br />This is one of the unit's weaknesses, though. You have in essence a squeeze-toy and are squeezing it manually with your hand to get liquid to come out. This is far from an exact science. There's no fine line between a teaspoon and a tablespoon. You need to squirt less and then add a little more if you need to. There's no way, of course, to unsquirt the flavoring once it's in the water. The most you could do is add more water.<br /><br />Still, I have to say I think this is fairly brilliant. In the past there were powder options to carry with you that were messy and hard to use. You'd spill the powder. You'd have trouble getting the powder to really mix into the liquid. With this liquid flavoring option, it's so much simpler. The unit squirts without dripping. The liquid blends into the water pretty much instantly. It carries easily in your purse and with its 24-serving ability it means if a friend or two want some as well you can share.<br /><br />For nutrition, there's no calories, no fat, no sodium, no carbs, no protein, no nothing. It adds flavor to your water and nothing else. This is a great way to get you to drink more water, which is important for your health!<br /><br />The sweeteners used here are sucralose and acesulfame potassium. The amounts are so tiny (under 2%) that I really wouldn't worry about that and, again, if you're currently not drinking enough water and this will help you do that, then I'm all in favor of that.<br /><br />Well recommended!

You may or may not agree but taste and color is the main difference between the two. Both are very handy, especially when traveling. No calories, no caffeine and no sugar are a big plus in making plain water more appetizing. The MIO is a bit on the pricey side because I don't get anywhere near the "up to 24" glasses of drink from this tiny bottle. Of course MIO left themselves an out with the "up to" part. My taste buds are not sensitive enough to get 24 glasses out of one Mio bottle but I do get around 18. Looking forward to trying other flavors.

review/text: There are people that love water and can drink glass after glass.  Then there are those that can't stand the taste (or lack there of.  That's where Mio Liquid comes in.  Sure, there have been little powder packets that sweeten and flavor your water, but you have to take what they give you, and sometimes and can be too weak or two strong with no way to adjust (except adding more water if too strong).  I like that Mio gives you the ability to set the flavor as strong or as weak as you want by adding it drop by drop.  However, the first time out with this product your going to find your self adding and subtracting quite a bit until you find your acceptable flavor.  If you have varying servings of water, then you have to experiment all over again.  Peach Tea didn't really impress me or taste much like it, but there are many other flavors out there that I'm willing to experiment with.

review/summary: I love these little things!
review/text: I find that something with some flavor quenches my thirst better and motivates me to drink more. So I always carry the sticks of powdered flavoring or the True Lemon packets. These, however, don't have to dissolve, which is a problem with some of the powders, especially if you have ice in the beverage. Some of the Mios taste great, like this one, and some not so great (like the mango) but they're all convenient. I think perhaps I don't like the ones that have too strong a Splenda taste, which I've never liked. The peach tea seems to hide it better. I tend to make mine with a lot less flavoring than recommended and this one lends a nice light flavor. One word of caution: if you like to carry the little bottles in a bag or purse put it in a ziploc. I've had them come open and get that highly colored liquid all over!

review/summary: I love this stuff!
review/text: Personally, I've been drinking diet soda and artificially sweetened tea for so long that I'm almost offended if there isn't a low caloric drink option to select from (whether at a restaurant or party).  But too often, those options tend to be limited, that's where the MIO Liquid Peach Tea comes in handy.  Its small enough to slip into your pocket, then just add a few (or a lot if you're a flavor fiend) drops to cold water; and with a minimum of stirring etc. you have a delicious glass of zero calorie peach tea.<br /><br />Taste?  Let's face it, if it didn't taste good, this wouldn't be an option.  Fortunately it tastes great! and tere are a number of flavors available.  I just happen to prefer the peach.  And the fact that it's a liquid means that you don't need to forcefully stir anything just to get the drink you wanted.<br /><br />It's ideal for camping and road trips as well.  Obviously, if you can find some suitable drinking water, you have tea.

review/summary: Hey, not bad!
review/text: Prior to trying this product, I had been using the single-serving powder packs from various manufacturers -- Crystal Light, generic Wal-Mart brand, etc. -- so I would say those are the primary competition for a product like MiO. One thing MiO has going for it right away is that there is less mess involved. Sometimes the powdered drinks don't cooperate as well when being poured (I've accidentally inhaled some of that stuff) and they definitely don't mix in with water as seamlessly as a few drops of MiO does. The second advantage with MiO is it is easier to make your beverage stronger or weaker to taste than with the powdered packets. Sometimes I'd have a bigger beverage cup and would have to open up a second package of a powdered drink to get enough flavor in there. I'd only wind up using half of the second package and the rest of it would go to waste. MiO makes it easier to adjust for the size of your beverage container with no waste.<br /><br />Onto the flavor -- tea-flavored drinks can be VERY hit and miss but MiO's peach tea flavor is surprisingly pleasant. When you first mix it in, it fizzes for a moment. I have to admit I was pretty skeptical. But the flavor of this was far superior to any flavored teas that come in jars as well as any brand of single-serving powder packets that I've tried. Its flavor teeters somewhere between the powdered teas and the fresh-brewed/bottled teas. I would definitely buy this product and can't wait to try some of their other flavors!

review/summary: Great for sprucing up your water
review/text: This stuff is great for sprucing up your water. If you drink a lot of water, as I do, you'll enjoy the ability to add a bit of flavor to your water to change things up so to speak. You can add a few drops for a hint of flavor or add a whole bunch to make it a full flavored peach tea.<br /><br />The flavor is quite good with natural peach flavor and good fresh brewed teat taste. The artificial sweetener is hardly noticed and leaves minimal after taste.  You can add it to a cup of water or to your bottle. Take to a restaurant and add to ice water for a glass of tea.<br /><br />Since it is liquid it easily dissolves and leaves no clumps or grittiness like the powders so often do.

review/summary: Not bad taste but really fake coloring
review/text: Let's face it. Water is the best drink for you and I agree. But it does get a little boring, so Mio is a nice to have change. It comes in several flavors, and I tried the Peach Tea. The taste is not bad, but you have to experiment with just how much you want to squeeze into your water. Too much and it tastes really sweet with an aftertaste, and really doesn't taste like tea at all. Too little and it's just colored water with no taste.<br /><br />One thing I did not like about the Peach Tea flavor is the color. It does not look like tea, or peach, at all. While this might seem petty, the fake color looks, well...fake, and it cheapens it somewhat. It's like buying peach ice cream that is the color of an orange. It has artificial written all over it.<br /><br />I also tried the pomegranate flavor and liked the taste of that. But again, you have to experiment to find the right amount for your palate. A neat idea in a neatly sized package.

review/summary: Normal usage = 27 servings tested for me, and about the coloring
review/text: I posted a picture that says it all about servings. Some of the reviews seem skeptical so I started keeping track with a mark after each use. My usage was 27 servings from one bottle.<br /><br />Some people have said these have too much food color in them but I realized why: the color is serving strength feedback. People expect tea to be a certain color so they heavily color the MiO so that you'll get the color you expect at the dosage you should use. This is clearly purposeful product design.<br /><br />I did not find the smell or aftertaste odd the way some people did. I drank this at my desk and during workouts to get some flavor without empty calories and it worked great.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: This "water enhancer" was really tasty and you don't have to use a lot of it to flavor even a large glass of water. The flavor was good without being overpowering, and it's fun using the little bottle. My only complaint is the price. At $3.99 per bottle (Kraft's listed price on their site, not Amazon's), you're paying more for the bottle and the wow-factor than the actual flavoring itself. While this is a really good product, I don't imagine I'll be spending four bucks on less than two ounces of flavoring and a "futuristic" bottle.

review/text: ...but don't add too much. In a 16.9oz. bottle of water, 3 squirts is enough for me and I like sweet-ish drinks. Something about the peach flavors I noticed is that the peach overpowers the other flavor. I have another review on here for the Mango Peach where I talk about how I taste more peach than mango. The same is true for this one. I taste more peach than I do tea.  Overall, this is a tasty low-cal, low-carb alternative for those who are looking for a drink that won't cause them to rack-up calories throughout the day.

review/summary: Ethylene Glycol
review/text: Honestly, I really can't stand the Peach Tea flavor. It's terrible. The other flavors, especially the Strawberry Watermelon flavor, are quite good. But I am still giving the Peach Tea flavor 5 stars because someone decided to copy and paste a rumor they heard on "da internetz" about Propylene Glycol (an ingredient in MiO) being an ingredient in anti-freeze without doing research, and I wanted to offset the rating system.<br /><br />ETHYLENE glycol, sound familiar? That's because you put it in your car, in the form of anti-freeze, NOT PROPYLENE GLYCOL, which is found in MiO. Propylene glycol won't poison your pets. In fact, research indicates it would be nearly impossible to reach toxic levels by consuming foods or supplements.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't care if people buy this product or not. If you're not a fan of chemicals, don't buy MiO, because I'm pretty sure it's loaded with them. But my advice is do your freakin' research BEFORE you start slamming a product.

review/text: I've seen the commercials for this product for about six months and only in the last month have they gotten it in the local stores.  So, I decided to try it and wow, it was a good change from the other water enhancers.  It was sweet without being too sweet.  Another good thing was the fact that I got to choose how much or how little flavor I put in.  That a plus!!  The only thing that I've had a problem with is that I put too much in the first time and it gave me quite a pucker.

review/summary: Skeptical at first, really glad I tried it
review/text: MiO uses sucralose (600 times sweeter than sugar) as the primary sweetener.  I was skeptical, worried in fact that this would be way too artificial for me, but it was pleasantly surprising.  And then it became obsessively addictive!<br /><br />The peach tea flavor is awesome.  It's about 5 times better than the diet Snapple one - and the cost works out to about 75% cheaper - depending on how concentrated you like it.<br /><br />Before you use for the first time - be aware - there is a membrane top under the cover.  Best bet - hold VERY low to your water - or it will hit the ice cubes and go all the place!<br /><br />Next, when you achieve the perfect level of taste for YOU - and that is the whole purpose - to customize your water perfectly - memorize the shade.  That way you can easily duplicate the taste and you too, will soon become addicted.<br /><br />Plain ice water is absolutely great with me, but I will admit that I am drinking an additional 2-3 large (3 cup size) glasses of ice water more than I usually do.<br /><br />Give it a try.  I plan on adding a few flavors.

review/text: I've seen the ads for MIO many, many, many times, but never considered it as anything but another gimmick.  After receiving the MIO Mango Peach, and the Peach Tea from Amazon Vine I can testify that these are actually wonderful.  The ease of use and taste is excellent.  We go through lots and lots of drink products and, in general, they take up enormous amounts of shelf space when we buy them in bulk to save money during sales.<br /><br />I haven't calculated the cost effectiveness of MIO yet, but I could store several bottles of this in very little space.  Normally we buy Arizona Tea either in the cans or the gallon jugs, and using MIO would be a great alternative.<br /><br />MIO will now be a favorite at our house along with Crystal Light Lemonade.

review/text: Well, was this ever a nice surprise! A bitty squirt, and I DO mean bitty, into a glass of water and voila!  Instant peach iced tea!  The flavor is quite nice, sweetened but not so much so that it gags you, and the peach flavor is quite present but not overpowering.  It is very refreshing, just awesome actually. One of those products you literally stumble upon and see yourself using it the rest of your life.  Kids love it too so that's the ultimate test in my book!  It's best with ice cubes though - the flavor kinda grabs you otherwise.  You don't need much - just a bit of a squirt into an 8-ounce glass of water and you're done.  The package will last for about 10-12 glasses of good tea, which isn't too bad and it doesn't need refrigerated after opening.  You need to use it within 30 days, however, after opening.<br /><br />Great product, a great idea and a very fast pick-me-up at work.  Highly, highly recommend!

review/text: This is the first time I've tried Mio, and I like it very much! One of the features I like is how you can easily control the amount and customize it to your preferences. Most enhancers I've had are too sweet (I'm not a fan of any super sweet beverages) or they have little flavor. Mio Peach tea seems to have the perfect balance. My husband, who likes his tea sweeter, actually likes this too. He uses a bit more than I do, and that's why this is such a great idea - it suits everyone. I am looking forward to trying the other flavors as well.

review/summary: Great item for traveling, especially overseas
review/text: One of our disappointments in traveling last year to Costa Rica--and other countries over the years--was the absence of iced tea. Sorry folks---we've been hooked on iced tea for 50 years! Anyway, we don't drink wine or beer, and water/carbonated beverages got old in the tropics. In Germany, for three years we longed for having iced tea with our schnitzel! This year we tried taking a few small bottles of MIO in Peach Tea and Sweet Tea flavors. Outstanding! Made a LOT of difference, whether at meals or just drinking bottled water. Advantage over powdered flavorings is that you can adjust the strength of the mixture a squirt at a time. (What would you do with a glass of water, but with an envelope of powdered flavoring for a quart of water?) And, for those concerned about passing airport security, these contain only 1.6oz. Use 'em at the office for drinks during the day. Very convenient.

review/summary: chemical candy like flavor
review/text: If this had been the first MIO I tried, I wouldn't have risked any other flavor.<br /><br />The concept is great, sugar and caffeine free, portable and an option for people who dislike plain water or who are on sugar-restricted diets. Since hydration is an issue for people who drink too much coffee or soda, it's a great idea.<br /><br />This flavor reminds me of candy more than fruit. How some fruit flavored candies don't taste anything like the fruit they are supposed to be. The artificial sweetener makes the chemical taste worse. I liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4EBMG">MIO Mango Peach)</a>, this missed the mark for me.<br /><br />So why two extra stars? My son disagrees with me, and likes the peach flavor quite a bit. He also likes it mixed into homemade yogurt.<br /><br />If you like sweetness and flavor, this maybe better for you than it was for me. I'll stick the Mango Peach when I'm out and want a bit of flavor and sweetness. When at home, I prefer chilled brewed herbal teas to hydrate with flavor.

review/summary: Takes a few times to get used to - but surprisingly good and convenient
review/text: Kraft gives the water enhancer market a try with this MiO line of water enhancers. I tried this peach tea flavor with an open mind. Here at my thoughts:<br /><br />* It takes some time to get used to. For me, after about 2 tries, it tasted like well, peach tea. It doesn't taste as juicy, but it was close. I would put the taste consistency somewhere between Cool Aid and Tang. While it may not give you much nutrition, at least it does tastes like Peach<br /><br />* I like the convenience of the bottle "squeeze." Every time you squeeze the bottle, one squirt will fill (according to the bottle), 8 fl ounces. That's about one cup. Each bottle has 24 squeezes. In my experimentation, one squirt in a big bottle (24 fl ounces) still has the peach flavor. For one cup, it actually tastes very strong. I like it mild and not too heavy. The "squeeze" is nice because it gives you a measure for the concentration of the flavor.<br /><br />* It's portable. Compared to a big containers of Lipton sweeteners or Tang, this little guy packs a punch in a small package. This is great for someone on-the-go and wants to add some flavor to water.<br /><br />Occasionally, there are many people like me who want to drink something sweet, but not too heavy. When I don't feel like drinking soda, fruit juices, this MiO liquid Peach tea is actually a good alternative. Plain water can be boring sometimes. I drink lots of water at work, so adding a little flavor to my water is a little refreshing. Kraft did a good job with their first try at water enhancers. Looking forward to seeing what they can do in the near future.<br /><br />P.S. I also recommend the Lipton line of sweeteners, like the  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006004C8">Lipton Iced Tea Sugar Sweetened Iced Tea Mix, Natural Lemon Flavor, 74.2-Ounce Containers (Pack of 2)</a>.

review/summary: Peachy, but not peachy keen.
review/text: Peach is always a good flavor, and while I'm not a tea drinker at all, I decided to give this peach tea drink by MIO a shot. I was surprised at the packaging being this tiny little capsule that you squeeze the dark orange flavoring out of, and quickly realized that you don't need to squeeze very hard. I've only had a couple servings of this drink, and I'm still on the fence with it. On one hand, it doesn't taste bad. On the other, it doesn't taste great, and it uses sucralose (think Splenda). That's never a good thing in my book, and many people share the same view.<br /><br />You know what else isn't that great? The fact that this stuff has pretty much no nutrition at all. Isn't this where you start to wonder what the point of buying this is when there's, you know, REAL tea out there? Of course, the key selling feature for this line of drink is the fact that it's super portable and can fit in your pocket, purse, backpack, whatever and isn't at much of a risk of breaking open. Some people have mentioned this stuff having a bad aftertaste, but I didn't experience that. Heck, I drank a small glass of this just before I started the review and there's no aftertaste to speak of. Maybe I was more conservative in my portions.<br /><br />I'd recommend this only for people who need some flavor every now and then, but if you want something on a regular basis, go with something healthy and real.

review/text: If "I liked it" could constitute a review, then I could say it in three words, but to be really helpful, I should say that while this product adequately gave me as much flavor as I wanted in adding it to my water, it also lends itself to getting carried away. You are supposed to introduce it to water drop by drop, but I'm too impatient for that, and it ends up not being a very economical addition because I just shoot it into the water. It does the job, however; it dresses up water if plainness is not what you had in mind, and it's easier than having to shake up powdery products.

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:35 Mins<br /><br /></span>MiO Liquid Water Enhancer is adult Kool Aid, for better or worse. However, a tip of the hat should go to the marketing team that developed the "water enhancer" description as well as the product's attractive logo and packaging. As far as water additives go, MiO stands out among its competitors.<br /><br />However, when it comes to taste, MiO fails to capture the subtlety of home brewed peach tea. The artificial coloring - Yellow 5, Blue 1 and Red 40 - transform a clear glass of water into a Kool-Aidesque concoction. I didn't care for the jaw-aching sweetness in my first sip or the chemical aftertaste that lingered on (and colored) my tongue.<br /><br />MiO offers six flavors: Berry Pomegranate, Strawberry Watermelon, Fruit Punch, Mango Peach, Sweet Tea and Peach Tea, the latter being the flavor I received from Amazon Vine to test. As you can see in my video, MiO is easy to use and quickly changes the look, smell and taste of plain water. Again, for better or worse, depending on your own taste.<br /><br />Each MiO bottle provides roughly 24 servings, depending on how strong you mix your drink. The ingredients are: water, Malic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Citrict Acid, Contains less than 2% of natural flavor, Sucralose and Acesulfame potassium (sweeteners), Potassium citrate, Yellow 5, Blue 1, Red 40, Potassium Sorbate (preservative).<br /><br />In summary, I didn't care for MiO's peach tea flavor, its artificial colors and its aftertaste. The product packaging is excellent and, should Kraft release another formula, I'd be interested in trying this again.<br /><br />Rating: Two stars

review/summary: Not the Best Mio Flavor, but Not Bad Either
review/text: I adore Mio. I have tried ALL the flavors that they have out. This flavor was the last one that I tried since I am not a huge peach fan. I decided to give it a shot anyhow because I do like tea and they had it in Vine.<br /><br />I can no longer have sugar due to health issues and Mio makes it a lot easier for me to drink water (I actually love plain water, but sometimes you just need/want some flavor). I love that it is so portable and you can mix it in ANY amount of liquid (whether you have a 20oz bottle of water or a gallon) and in any container (bottles, cups, gallon jugs, pitchers, etc.). You can also decide how much to add. If you like it strong and sweet, just add more Mio. If you want your flavor faint, then add only a tiny bit. It is easy, delicious and it doesn't have carbs or sugar. The only bad thing I can say about Mio is that there is a lot of coloring and it can stain your clothes or desk. I do wish it had less coloring.<br /><br />On to the flavor, I was pleasantly surprised that the peach flavor was not overpowering. I am still not quite sure if this tastes like flavored tea, but it is nice and refreshing. While this is not my favorite flavor, it is pretty good. If you are a huge peach fan then you will probably love it. I personally will not buy this flavor again, but that is just because I like other flavors better. I am going to stick with my favorite flavors (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOQGO">MIO Orange Tangerine, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4FUGW">MIO Berry Pomegranate, 1.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOQKA">MIO Black Cherry, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>).

review/summary: Mio Peach Tea - Nasty Aftertaste
review/text: I love peach tea, my favorite is Snapple Peach.  That is amazing stuff.  I also drink Crystal Light Peach Tea, and it's okay.  I like my drinks lightly flavored though, so the Crystal Light isn't good for traveling since I only use a little bit of powder and the rest is difficult to store.  I saw Mio and thought it was an awesome idea.  Easy to carry and I can flavor to taste.  Unfortunately, for me, it taste like chemicals and has a horrible aftertaste.  It's a peachy, oily, plasticky flavor.  Hard to drink.  As I'm typing this, my mouth feels like it's coated with chemicals. I initially gave it 2 stars, but lowered it to one. I could only make it through half a bottle of water.<br /><br />The idea is genius, but the peach tea misses the mark for me. I may try other flavors, but I would expect them to have a similar aftertaste.  The concept is 5 star, but the peaches execution is a 1.<br /><br />Edit:  I tried it again with more flavor and it's better.  Still slightly chemical, but drinkable.  Unfortunately, I like my drinks just slightly flavored and it's a little too sweet for me.  Up to 3 stars.

review/summary: Good Taste but Strange Smell
review/text: I've been trying to give up sodas and switch to water but was just getting bored so decided to give Mio a try.  Peach Tea flavor is the first one I've purchased and it definitely didn't work for me.  When you open the small container, there is an immediate smell that I can only describe as bleach-like - sort of like an overly chlorinated indoor swimming pool on a hot day.  I thought it was probably just because it was concentrated and would be okay once diluted in water.  I added 2 squirts to my full bottle of water (20 oz.) and took a sip.  The flavor is actually pretty good, not Snapple tea good, but passable.  The smell, however, was just as strong as it was in the concentrate.  Every sip was like taking a big mouthful of pool water.  I couldn't finish it. I ended up tossing it out.  A couple of co-workers tried it and both said the same thing.  "It smells like bleach."<br />I don't know if I'll try other flavors after my experience with Peach Tea but definitely would not recommend this flavor to anyone.

review/summary: Favorite Flavor
review/text: I've tried several of the other Mio flavors and think they're okay, but this one is great.  Reviews are mixed, obviously because everyone's tastes are different. It's cheap, much healthier than sodas, and if you like the flavor it will encourage you to drink more water. You've got very little to lose. I'm going to stock up on this one.

review/summary: Peachy keen
review/text: Great little product... put a tiny squirt into your bottle of water and you'll have a lightly-flavored peach beverage, or put a bigger squirt and get a drink reminiscent of a bottle of peach-flavored Snapple.  Depending on my mood, I go back and forth.<br /><br />And don't be fooled by the tiny squeeze container.  Even if you routinely go for that extra squirt, each 1.62-ounce container will still last you quite a while.  Because even if you like that extra bit of sweetness in your beverage, you still won't need to use all that much of the product each time you grab for it.<br /><br />And the peach taste is not merely serviceable or "good".  With a natural fruit taste underscored with a bit of "zing", the final result is actually quite tasty.  In fact, it's probably a little better than peach-flavored Snapple.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this product sample, and when the time comes I'll buy a new supply of it at my own expense, with no qualms.

review/summary: tastes like home made peach tea! PERFECT!
review/text: Having company over one day I discovered horrifically I had no tea to serve. I had some MIO in my purse, and it saved the day. I took each glass, squirted in some MIO peach tea flavor, filled each glass with ice and water and a quick stir, and VIOLA, instant tea with home made taste. THIS IS MY FAVORITE MIO flavor by far, this is EXCELLENT!

review/summary: This is not good, which is sad, because I wanted it to be good.
review/text: As someone who struggles to drink enough water, I wanted to like this product. I'm always searching for healthy, non-sugary drinks. We tested the MIO in filtered water in clean glass cups with the suggested ratio of MIO to water. The peach MIO has a light flavor, but the taste is about 33% peach and 67% artificial flavor that is unpleasantly chemical. I can't even call the chemical flavor an "aftertaste" because it was bad going down as well as lingering. The product is a good idea because it's boring to drink water all the time, but MIO is going to have to work on its peach flavor.

review/summary: Artificial Taste, no Nutritional Value, and Questionable Ingredients..Are You Ready to Try?
review/text: Drinking water is important, but many among us do not drink as much as we should. One reason is the lack of taste and this is where Mio Liquid Water Enhancer Peach Tea flavor can make a difference. It offers a convenient, quick means to add a little flavor to otherwise bland water, increasing the chances that we will drink as much water as we should.<br /><br />I have seen and heard about these Mio products for some time, but this one, the peach flavor, is the first one I have ever tried. And now that the experience is behind me, I must admit that my feelings are mixed. Yes, it is better tasting than a plain glass of water and it does encourage me to drink more water on a regular basis. But the flavor is a tad too sweet and there is actually very little peach or tea taste. The overall flavor profile is artificial and not nearly as good as the flavor of a fresh, real, fruity drink.<br /><br />Along with the taste, another issue I have with this product is the odd smell. It is chemical- like in nature and very unappetizing. I would never guess, by smell alone, that this was a peach flavored liquid. It has an artificial smell that makes you hesitate to try it. I can assure you that it tastes better than it smells once it is diluted in water, but the smell is still unappealing.<br /><br />There is no nutritional value with this drink, but also no calories so it won't expand the waistline. I recommend not looking at the ingredient list because it will raise many concerns due to the artificial colors and preservatives. These are certainly not good qualities, but on the other hand, most of the beverages on the store shelves are no better and some would say they are even worse. At least with a product like this, you are actually consuming a very small amount of the liquid with each serving, so the negative effects are minimal.<br /><br />Taking everything into account, Mio Liquid Water Enhancer Peach Tea flavor is a tough product to rate. The taste is okay, but nothing amazing. The ingredient list raises some eyebrows, but is no worse than many other common beverages. There is no nutritional value, but also no calories. On the positive side, the product is packaged in a small container, is very convenient, and encourages consumption of water. So, with all of these good and bad qualities, I am going to take the take the middle ground and give this beverage flavoring a middle rating overall. It isn't anything special, but it has enough going for it to consider a sample.

review/summary: "Controversial" Ingredients, chemical taste
review/text: Here is the MIO Peach Tea ingredient list that KRAFT has so well hidden on their site that I actually had to go to another website to find them:<br /><br />Water, Malic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Flavor(s) Natural, Sucralose and Acesulfame Potassium Sweetener, Potassium Citrate, Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1, Potassium Sorbate Preservative<br /><br />The controversial ingredients are as follows: 1) Propylene Glycol, 2) "Flavors Natural" 3) Acesulfame Potassium Sweetener, 4) Red 40, 5) Yellow 5 and (last but not least controversial!) 6) Blue 1<br /><br />You can find out more about Franken-foods such as MIO Peach Tea Water Enhancer in the "Food Facts" website.<br /><br />KRAFT should try something really controversial like making a peach tea from TEA LEAVES, PEACHES & SWEETENER.

review/summary: Water enhancer -- make it "your way"
review/text: I am not really fond of drinking plain water. I try all sorts of additives to try to make it flavorful so I will actually drink enough to meet my fluid requirements. Finding the perfect taste blend hasn't been easy! My ultimate favorite beverage mix has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9U6">Crystal Light Peach Tea Drink Mix (12-Quart), 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>. As noted, you have to make 2 quarts at a time unless you buy the packets of individual servings to add to water bottles when on the go.<br /><br />The best things about this MIO Liquid Peach Tea:<br />1) It's a liquid and no issues with particulates - dissolves easily<br />2) You can add as much or as little as you want to a volume of water to get the right flavor for your personal taste<br />3) No calories, no caffeine<br />4) Small compact carrying size goes easily into purse, bag, pocket, backpack, etc. and does not leak or crush<br /><br />Whether or not you like the taste is the bottom line and you will just have to try it in order to determine that. The only other issue is cost. MIO vs ready-to-drink flavored water or some other brand -- prices vary greatly.

review/summary: Peach Flavor? Nah, It's Sugar Plastic Flavor!
review/text: Well, if I wanted to know what artificial peaches tasted like, now I know. MiO Liquid is a "water enhancer". I.e. it adds flavor to water. The idea is a good one. Making water more flavorful without adding any calories. I love regular, good old, peach tea; so, I thought I would give this a try. It is not that good. It is not good at all. I can barely taste the peaches. Instead, all I can taste is sugar and artificial flavors. Tastes like plastic. My mouth feels very dry and I am thirsty after drinking this. This tastes better if you add just a few drops.<br /><br />As I mentioned, this has no calories, fat or anything else. The ingredients list is way too long for what it is. how about just taking the essence of good old pea tea.<br /><br />Although it is convenient and easy to carry, I would not buy it.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy product.
review/text: As a person who loves a brand name bottle of  flavored water without calories,I was really excited to try "MIO Liquid Peach Tea." I get 24 glasses of this product per container.  I can pay up to $1.49 a day per 24 ounce bottle of the other product drinking at the very least 5 bottles a day.  Costly.  MIO Liquid Peach Tea, 1.62-Ounce, (Pack of 4) offers you 24 glasses of water with this delicious peach tea flavoring while allowing you to chose the amount of intensity you desire.<br /><br />It is a must better choice for the environment as these small containers hold enough flavoring drops to make 24 glasses of enhanced water.  I know the plastic bottles fill up my garbage can soooooooooooo quickly and  that has been really bothering me.<br /><br />An extra plus is they come in a variety of flavors.  One won't tire as quickly of the same taste.<br /><br />Great product with a very pleasing taste!!!

review/summary: Tastes ok at first, not sure about the hype
review/text: I like certain fruit flavors in beverages, like peach and orange - provided they are natural.  This tastes okay going in, but is far too artificial and leaves a nasty after taste.  The smell is a little off for peach - almsot chlorine like.  Perhaps that explains the reviewer who said she was able to bleach her porcelein sink.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the hype with these are.  I'd rather buy tea from Snapple or Arizona.  Or, even better, brew flavored tea and then ice it.<br /><br />While this may make a lot, it seems very expensive.  I am not going to buy this or try it again.

review/summary: I wasn't expecting to like this at all...(and upon reflection, I don't)
review/text: I was weary about even trying this product.  I've seen them advertised for a while now, but the whole idea of a water flavorer just seemed odd to me, and I had this feeling that it was going to either be cloyingly sweet or so muted `flavor-wise' that it would resemble those bottles of cheap `flavored water' you get at Walmart.  While it can verge on too sweet at times, depending on how hard you squeeze that bottle (thus the amount of syrup you get out of a single `serving'), this really does taste pretty darn good.  It's a nice way to add some flavor to a sodaless diet (something I've been trying hard to eliminate).  I wouldn't recommend drinking this all the time (LOL at all the facts pointing to it not being good for you, and the fact that it can clean your counters), and it's odd that the aftertaste (which clings to the back of your throat) doesn't really hit you until a few minutes after you're done drinking it, but it is pretty tasty and is a nice change of pace for a day, week, month that consists of water, water and more water.<br /><br />EDIT:  Wow, so as this day wore on that aftertaste clung to the back of my throat in the grossest of ways.  Seriously, it is still there and I can't get it to go away.  It rests in the back of your mouth, and basically coats everything you eat or drink from there on out.  So, my original grade of 4 is now demoted to a 2 because the sickening aftertaste is enough to keep me from ever drinking this again.

review/summary: 24 servings per container for less than a quarter each
review/text: A 1.62 ounce container of MIO is said (on the label) to be enough for 24 drinks. The serving size (of MIO before it's added to water) is 2 mL. Using a cup with mL measurements (from a bottle of cough medicine) I measured 2 mL to see exactly how much of a drink it can make. Added to 8 ounces of water, the peach flavored MIO makes a drink as peachy and sweet as I would want. The bottom line is, depending on how much one pays for a single container of MIO, one should be able to make 24 8 ounce drinks at less than twenty five cents per drink. And that is without having to buy a bulky, heavy, environmentally unfriendly package of two dozen 8 ounce drinks in containers that you have to discard.<br /><br />My daughter convinced me of the importance of keeping well-hydrated, and for a few years I've been using Crystal Light (often a generic version) to help make H2O more desirable. Two things I don't like about Crystal Light are that it tends to seem tart or acidic, and I only like it cold (from a pitcher in the refrigerator or over ice). (In addition, when I see the residue that Crystal Light leaves in glass pitchers, residue that takes a bit of scrubbing to remove, I wonder what it might leave in me.) Ice cold beverages are fine in the summer, but sometimes I prefer room temperature water in the winter, and I find MIO (both the peach and iced tea flavors) palatable when mixed in room temp water. I've always hesitated to buy MIO in stores because of the price, but this was before I figured out how relatively little each serving costs.<br /><br />MIO is also of course convenient, for one can carry the little container just about anywhere - I've tested it and have never had any spillage - and as long as there's water (including in restaurants), one can have an instant, flavored, no calorie drink.

review/summary: A pleasant change
review/text: I drink a lot of water throughout the day and sometimes it gets old, I start to crave a little flavor and that's usually when I make a bad choice and grab a soda. I've been wanting to try mio for a while so when it got offered to me through Amazon Vine I went ahead and grabbed it. I'm so glad I did, it makes my water delicious just be careful just a little goes a long way. No calories no carbs and no sugar, this stuff is perfect for everyone especially those trying to loose weight and increase their water intake. Ive recommend it to everyone even my mom who is sugar sensitive. Oh mio where have you been, great product indeed!
