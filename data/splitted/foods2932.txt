review/summary: Exactly what I expected and wanted
review/text: I got this before I got my keurig because a few of us at the office pitch in for the machine at work. I got my box super fast. The exp date is in dec which isn't bad because 35 cups should be gone by then. I was expecting the brown bag but got a box marked coffee instead. I'm ok with that. I had all 35 cups and no duplicates. In all I had 4 teas, 2 hot chocolates, 6 flavored coffees, 2 cappuccinos, 1 iced coffee, and 1 decaf, the rest was a nice variety of roasts and brands. I really can't complain and will order again. I get easily bored with the same coffee so this really helps me a lot. Thank you.

review/text: This mix of drink mixes is a good starter kit to figure out what you like. I wasn't sure what I was looking for and it was a good mix for my wife and I. I prefer the darker stuff and she likes the lighter stuff. We both found what we like it here. Plus, it comes with some iced-t and hot chocolate.

review/summary: Nice Sampler !
review/text: Sampler was EXACTLY as described. I enjoy flavored coffees so this was just the ticket! I received 35 fresh cups of differing product: Coffees - flavored & regular, light roast, medium and dark.(all good brands as well) Even got a sweet cappucino which was excellent. Not too crazy about the teas but my daughters enjoyed them.(only received about 4 of these so not a big deal) I get tired of the "same old thing" so this is a great way to try something new without buying a whole box. It is also one of the cheapest for the amount. I did not mind the paper bag it came in. It was packaged well and I plan to purchase this again!

review/summary: Nice selection. No repeats
review/text: I bought this after the office bought a new coffee machine, figuring that I'd prefer to buy my own k-cups rather than pay $1/cup for whatever flavor they had that week. This was a nice way to try a bunch of flavors at once, at the price is good (equivalent to buying a box of any one flavor on Amazon). I didn't get any repeats and most of the k-cups were good quality. A lot of it was from Brooklyn Bean Roastery and Wolgang Puck. A few cups were slightly smushed which isn't too surprising considering they came in a brown paper bag. Overall, a happy customer.

review/summary: Great variety, could have been shipped in a box
review/text: I ordered this for my new Keurig with the hopes to find a brand, flavor I liked. I received a brown paper sack with 35 k cups. I will say that there was a fantastic variety of coffee, decafs, teas, and even a few varieties of apple ciders. I know a few other people were irritated with the decafs and teas but I dont mind them. All in all, for the price (I paid .60 cent per k cup) its a cheaper way to find out what brands and flavors you like. My only complaint was that they came in a brown paper sack. I ordered other items that came in a larger box which I suppose made shipping easier. I had to find alternate storage.

review/summary: Fantastic!  This is what a variety pack should be like.
review/text: Keurigs are stupidly expensive and even though I got my machine for free, I feel like I'm flushing money down the toilet with this coffee.  What's even worse is that I'm really curious about different flavors and brands, different kinds of dark roasts and other varieties.  This sampler set is fantastic because not only does it really have 35 different K-cups, it also offers a really unique selection.  You don't get the typical Green Mountain varieties, I got Island Coconut, Mocha Nut Fudge, Southern Pecan and a few other unique flavors.  You'll even get some brands that you may have not heard of, like Brooklyn Bean Roasters.  This makes a great gift for you or someone who has a Keurig and really wants to see what else the company offers.

I've been enjoying having a wide variety of choices when I go for a drink.  We put out all the cups in two big bowls in the kitchen which are gradually emptying out.

review/summary: everything as it should be
review/text: Okay, getting past the strange packaging (a stapled paper bag inside a plastic bag inside a box), I found the contents, undamaged, fresh, and the loose k-cup count correct.<br /><br />The variety was interesting - there was no duplication, mostly brands and varieties I have seen readily available (the interesting newcomer was Brooklyn Brewery) - a nice balance between flavored and 'traditional' blend coffees.  There were about 4-5 teas (I ordered 2 samplers), and one hot chocolate in each sampler. 4-5 decafs in each.  The overall variety in each sampler was similar but different as well.<br /><br />I am very pleased with what I received and at .60/cup, that's a good deal!  And now I can try some types I have wanted to without making the major investment (chocolate glazed donut house, green mountain island coconut, wolfgang puck sorrento).<br /><br />I would buy again.

review/summary: Great assortment
review/text: These arrived in a brown bag and had a big assortment of coffee, decaf, tea, iced tea and iced coffee. Lots of different brands I'd never seen (Rev, Brooklyn) and lots of familiar ones (Donut House, Emeril, Gloria Jean). Nothing was past due and most expire at the end of 2012 or in 2013. A few were things I'm not sure I cared about-decaf Earl Grey tea for example-but I'm pretty sure SOMEONE at the office will drink it. Great price for them, nice variety, shipped fast and nothing stale. However, if you're looking for a more specific variety (like just coffee and no decaf or tea) you might be disappointed. This is the best price and most variety in a K-cup package I've ordered.

review/summary: Decent variety.
review/text: I read many of the reviews of this product before purchasing.  I have to agree with many of the other reviews.  The product did come in a brown bag, which I felt was a little haphazard, but ultimately ended up being okay (none of the coffees were damaged or anything).  More importantly, there were only a few duplicates, but there were SEVERAL coffees from the same company/brand but with different roasts/flavors.  I would guess that out of the 30-something coffees sent, 15 were the same brand.  Although, it was nice to see how this one company/brand has many different roasts/flavors, I really would have preferred to get a much wider perspective on many different brands and roasts.  However, for the most part, I was fairly satisfied.  When I am wanting a variety of different coffees, I will try this product once more.

review/summary: Disappointed-lots of different  bad coffees
review/text: Disappointed with pack---heavy on Brooklyn brand coffee (I don't like-not good coffee) & multiple mediocre brands of the same bold or medium brew.  Very low on flavored (only 3 pods) -not even 1 hazelnut-and too many premade "coffee drinks" with the hydrogenated fat creamer (high trans fat -YUK-not real coffee), iced coffee (with corn syrup or trans fat"creamer" - another YUK) or presweetened tea (a corn-syrup laden YUK to me).  Very few good brands (WG Puck & 1 Newmans Own pod being exceptions)- I gave away about 1/3 of the pods after opening the pack.  I have had better luck with Timothy or Gloria Jean variety packs.  Not for true coffee lovers - will not order again.

review/summary: Satisfied with the selection
review/text: Of the 35 k-cups, none of the dates that I saw were expired. All were at least 3 months out in the future. There were:<br /><br />- 28 caffeinated coffees<br />- 1 decaf<br />- 3 teas<br />- 1 apple cider<br />- 2 hot chocolates<br /><br />There was a good selection of brands. I was slightly bummed to get 5 that were Grove Square, as to me that's lower end quality. Overall there were only a couple exotic flavors, so most of them were just various roasts.<br /><br />- Don't buy it if it's a gift, at least not if you want nice packaging. If you want it for yourself, the brown bag didn't bother me and not a single cup was dented or open<br />- Don't buy it if you have your heart set on certain brands or flavors. You won't necessarily get what's advertised here or in your ideal amount. But if you're flexible and just want to try some different flavors without buying boxes of each, this fits the bill!

review/text: The good thing about this is there were no duplicates.  The bad part is, they were still all very similar and so far I haven't particularly enjoyed anything I've tasted.  Bitter and rather stale tasting frankly.  And my biggest issue is the fact that of 35 packs, only 5 were flavored.  We were hoping to discover something new by ordering 35 packs and it turns out that most of them are just bold coffees.  I already get that with my Sumatra k-cups from Starbucks.  I would definitely not purchase this again and would not recommend it.

review/text: I was a little apprehensive reading some of the other companies reviews on the random selections.  It seems that some come with multiple duplicates and bad variety.  Well these folks delivered a great product.  I ordered two 35 pack boxes (in case one might be better than the other) and there were zero duplicates in either box as well as only a few decaf.  That is exactly what I was looking for.  The selection was excellent, if I had any small complaint, it was the two boxes were almost identical.  But that is not to detract from the quick shipping and me being a very happy consumer.  I will definately continue to get these, I would recommend them highly if you are looking for a good variety of good coffee.

review/text: This package gives you a nice variety of coffees but not such a great variety of other products. I expected more hot chocolate, teas and ciders in this variety pack. (If I wanted so much coffee I would have ordered the coffee variety pack) You receive only 3 hot chocolates, all from Cafe Escapes. What about Swiss Miss or a white chocolate variety? The tea variety was OK but still based on the size of the pack I thought I would be getting more of a variety. Only received 1 cider, why not a regular and spiced? Overall I liked it, just not loved it.

However, I do say this gets 5 stars because I got exactly what I ordered: a nice variety pack for my new Keurig. Only one coffee -- the Wolfgang Puck Sorrento Medium Roast -- was doubled.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying all of these new drinks!

review/summary: Was apprehensive to order....
review/text: as the reviews were varied.  But so glad I did.  I got my stapled brown paper bag today and must say I am very happy with the selection I received.  A few flavored teas, Hot Chocolates (dark and milk), couple different apple ciders, even 1 Iced coffee. A couple cappuccinos, very good combination of coffees (mild, med. and bold), most of which I would of picked myself, nice assortment of flavored coffees and only 1 decaf.  Expiration dates were at least a couple of months away but most were into next year. All n' all, I am extremely satisfied with this assortment and can't wait to start trying them out.

review/summary: GREAT ASSORTMENT OF COFFEES & TEAS
review/text: Wanted to sample a variety of different coffees & teas before purchasing a big box.  Received 3 hot cocoa, 2 cider drink mixes, 3 cappuccino, 4 teas, & the rest are various types of coffee.  The brands include: Wolfgang Puck, Barista Prima, Brooklyn Bean Roastery, Donut House, Donut Shop, Starbucks, Kahlua, Caribou, Gloria Jean's, Green Mountain, REVV, Tully's, Newman's Own, Grove Square, Cafe Escapes, Celestial Seasonings, & Bigelow.  Received very quickly.  And the K-cups do come in a paper bag, but the bag is inside of an Amazon box.  If it was wrapped in plastic, the flavor of the coffee might be affected.  I am very happy with my purchase & will order from this seller again!

review/text: As new Keurig users, we wanted to try a lot of different types of drinks before we bought any full packs. This is a great way to do just that. We got 35 cups and one 1 repeat. About 25 of the cups were coffee types, then the rest were a mixture of coffee, cider, and tea. Very happy with our purchase!

review/summary: Wonderful Variety of Coffee
review/text: I just got a Keurig about a week ago and was overwhelmed by all the choices I had for K-cups.  Luckily, I found this deal.  I, too, was concerned that I would get a lot of duplicates, but after reading the reviews, I thought, "What the heck...Nothing to lose.  Even if I get 35 of the same thing, I'm still getting a good price for K-cups."  Well, needless to say, I didn't get "35 of the same thing."  Here's what was shipped in my bag:<br /><br />1  Green Mountain Island Coconut<br />1  Green Mountain Southern Pecan<br />1  Donut House by Green Mountain: Chocolate Glazed Donut<br />1  Revv<br />1  Starbucks Pike Place Roast - Medium<br />1  Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee<br />1  Caribou Coffee Daybreak Morning Blend<br />1  Timothy's Kahlua Original<br />1 Coffee People Donut Shop<br />1 Coffee People Donut Shop Decaf<br />1 Coffee People Donut Shop Sweet & Creamy Regular Iced Coffee<br />1  Celestial Seasonings Green TEA with white tea<br />1  Celestial Seasonings Lemon Zinger Herbal Tea<br />1  Celestial Seasonings Perfect Iced Tea Half & Half Black Tea and Lemonade<br />1 Tully's Coffee House Blend<br />1 Nermans's Own Special Blend<br />1 Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa<br />1 Bigelow Mint Medley Herb Tea<br />2 Wolfgang Puck Sorrento Medium Roast Extra Bold<br />1 Wolfgang Puck Chef's Reserve Colombian Dark Roast<br />1 Wolfgang Puck Rodeo Dr Blend Medium Roast<br />1 Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya Dark Roast<br />1  Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino<br />1  Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino<br />1  Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuccino<br />1  Grove Square Spiced Apple Cider<br />1  Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider<br />1  Grove Square Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa<br />1  Grove Square Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa<br />2 Brooklyn Cyclone Extra Bold Dark Roast<br />1 Brooklyn Boardwalk Blend Medium Roast<br />1 Barista Prima Colombia<br />1 Barista Prima French Roast<br /><br />I only received duplicates on 2 flavors.  I'll take that deal any day of the week.  Once I finish making my way through these, I may "spin the wheel" again and see what other flavors I end up with.  I would definitely recommend this product.  If you are a new Keurig owner, this is a fantastic way to hone in on what your new brew will be.  And even if you've had your Keurig a while now, this is a great way to spice up your morning coffee routine.  :)

review/text: I'm sure the K cups are fine and a matter of taste like most flavored things. This selection came in an ordinary paper bag stapled across the top with ordinary office staples.  No identifying label - definitely no frills.  I only mention it because a box would have been nice and it immediately pointed out the reason they invented K cup drawers and carousels.

review/summary: It REALLY depends on who does the shipping on this
review/text: I've ordered this sampler twice: 1 from the Coffee Mix - LOVED their selection, absolutely NO repeats and shipped in a white box.  2nd from the Sampler King, a few repeats and some off season stuff.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't pay close attention to expiration dates on either since I personally find that many products (especially coffee)"expire" before there's really any effect on the taste.<br /><br />Overall though, I've been happy with both shippers as they both offered a good variety of mixed coffees which allow this K-cup newbie to narrow down what I like.<br /><br />Update:  I ordered yet again and it was Sampler King that sent my 3rd order.  I was much more disappointed with the selection (a LOT more repeats and off season stuff).  I wish Coffee Mix was a bit cheaper or offered Prime Shipping again.  They truly had no repeats and an amazing selection.<br /><br />I've also ordered from CTech and just like Sampler King, they have no repeats and include a great selection.

review/text: I received my sampler pack today and I was very pleased with the assortment I received.  My husband and I have very different tastes in coffee so this sampler pack will serve us well.  I received:<br /><br />-9 flavored coffees (4 special editions)<br />-14 regular coffees<br />-1 hot cocoa<br />-6 teas<br />-6 decafs<br /><br />Flavor wise we only got two duplicates which is fine by me because I love french vanilla.<br /><br />Some people are really turned off by the brown paper bag packaging but it didn't bother me.  It reminded me of the grab bags I used to get at the 99 cent store when I was a kid.<br /><br />I'm already working on trades with my co-workers for the flavors I don't think I will like.  Goodbye Pumpkin Spice, hello Raspberry Truffle!

review/text: I bought this product because it offered a wide selection of cups. Upon arrival I was impressed with the selection. There was a nice range of coffee and coffee with flavors. There was also some tea, hot cocoa and iced drinks. I was able to try to the tea and iced drinks without having to purchase a lot of the same. I did not have any repeats and I felt the price was good when comparing to the others. Overall if you a looking for a large selection of cups I would recommend this as a good way to try different options with your keurig. I had no issue with the seller I used and it was shipped quickly and arrived without issue.

review/summary: 35 wonderful cups!  Good variety!
review/text: I was nervous about buying a sample package because we aren't big fans of the extra bold coffees but I didn't want to buy another pack of one kind and have the same 20 cups in a row.<br /><br />We received the package today and it was in a brown bag that was stapled at the top (that bag was in another box since we ordered something else too) but all the cups were in fine condition.  There were 35 different cups and surprisingly there were only a couple extra bolds.  None of the cups were expired and most had months before the did expire.  We got a lot of Grove Square (7-8) and Wolfgang Puck (4), Green Mountain (4) but the rest were pretty varied.  We got hot chocolates (we already had those and they were tasty), ciders, flavored coffees, teas, regular coffees, cappuccinos, and I think one is actually an energy booster or something (Revv?)and a couple of specialty/seasonal coffees.<br /><br />I would definitely order this pack again and recommend it if you aren't too particular about what you are looking for and just want to try a bunch of different cups.

review/summary: Nice variety
review/text: Price wise it seems a pretty good value for a sampler.  Sampler packs usually cost more per cup than single flavor packs but I'd rather buy an initially more expensive sampler pack than waste alot of money on a single flavor pack and hate it  Actually it is a "unique" sampler.  Every k-cup was different and most were from a variety of brands. Use by dates are a good 5-6 months away. They were packaged loosely in a cardboard box and all the cups were intact.  I've found a few already that I'll be ordering later. Donut House Cinnamon Roll coffee and Barista Prima Italian Roast were quite good for their categories so far.

review/text: I just received my order today.  As noted in other reviews, the K cups came in a stapled brown bag.  However, unlike the previous review, all the K cups were clean and undamaged.  None of them were expired, and the earliest expiration was in mid-August .... plenty of time for my family.  I was so pleased with the selection in my bag!  Here are the details:<br /><br />12 regular coffees<br />10 flavored coffees (including several limited edition flavors)<br />3 hot teas<br />3 cappuccinos<br />2 iced coffees<br />2 decafs<br />1 iced tea<br />1 cider<br />and 1 hot cocoa<br /><br />I love that I have the opportunity to try so many different brands and flavors.  If I am looking for a variety pack in the future, I will definitely order again!

Some are strong coffee, others the way we like it :) . For a sampler, this is good, but packing is not consistent with advertisement (all different).

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised with the variety offered in this bundle. Many different manufacturers and K-Cup types were included. My main goal was to try a bunch of different types of available K-Cups to find some new ones I liked and I achieved this goal.<br /><br />The packaging was a brown paper bag stappled shut inside a shipping box and everything was in tact. My only real issue was that there was one duplicate in the "Guaranteed 35 Different K-cup Flavors". There were two of the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend. Overall though, I'd order again.

review/text: The Coffee Max Fabulous 35 K-cup Samples, was one of the best buys I have made in a long time. There were only two that neither I nor my husband would drink. But 35 flavors to try was great and undoubtedly prevented some purchases we would not have been happy with along with some, I never thought I would like that I enjoyed very much. There would be little reason to buy it again for myself, but would certainly consider it as a gift for anyone with a Keurig type coffee machine. I am 65 years old and would never, ever have considered making iced coffee until I got this selection then discovered several of the blends are good as iced coffee.

review/text: This was awesome! I got 35 different flavors of kcups, with mixed flavors and brands.<br /><br />Here is a rough breakdown off the top of my head:<br /><br />I got 5 different Celestial teas<br />1 hot chocolate<br />5-ish decafs<br />7-8 varieties of regular coffee (different strengths including "Jet Fuel")<br />and the rest were flavored coffees. Some of the highlights were Butter toffee, cinnamon roll, blueberry, french toast, too many to list!<br />Most of the kcups expire in December, which is plenty of time to drink them.<br /><br />There were a few seasonal ones (Pumpkin, Eggnog, Gingerbread) that expire in August, which is a little bit of a bummer, but I guess it's to be expected because those are seasonal ones. I'm still glad I got them, so I can try them to determine if I want to order whole cases of them this winter.<br /><br />I will definitely order again!! I'm really happy with it!

I have 35 completely different flavours including the Apple Cider, Pumpkin Spice, Iced Coffees etc. I just received my shipment today in acceptable packaging , haven't tried any of them a yet so this review is positive up to this point. Let's hope when I actually start to use the k-cups, I will not regret this positive review.

review/text: I saw the negative reviews for this product, but decided the positive outweighed the negative and it was worth a chance. Think of it just like that - a bit of a gamble. Maybe you'll get a good mix, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll get 35 cups, maybe not. I got 31 cups and they were not all unique - some were duplicates. All that said, the cups that I did get included a nice variety and there are several flavors that I had wanted to try and I am now getting to do so. I wish my mix had included more coffee and a bit less cocoa, but I feel like I totally signed-on for that gamble. I did, however, expect to receive the number of cups advertised.<br /><br />I waited to do my review because I contacted the seller and was hoping the situation would be corrected, but it's been nearly two weeks and I've had no response.

review/text: Considering we have a new Keurig machine at our house we wanted to try a variety of coffee/tea products.  Instead of buying 4 boxes of flavors we opted to purchase this "variety" product.  After reading quite a few reviews on Amazon I was skeptical on purchasing a "variety" pack thinking I wouldn't truly get a "big variety."  However, this sampler says you are "guaranteed 35 different K-cups" and they are right-we recieved all different cups, hot chocolate, caramel apple cider, flavored coffee, non-flavored coffee, iced tea, chai tea and decaf.  Some were even "limited edition" flavors.  I will buy from this company again-wonderful supply!

Only 3 were past or very close to their Best Used Before Date. I plan on buying this deal again.<br /><br />The Kcups were packaged in a brown paper bag with the top rolled down and stapled and then that bag was placed inside a plastic bag which was so helpfully labeled that the plastic bag is not a toy. ;) My box was rained on before I could retrieve it from my doorstep, so I do appreciate the protection of the plastic and don't resent the waste.<br /><br />I haven't sampled any yet, so I can't comment on the flavors yet, but wanted to get this review out the same day I received my package so that customers can see what they will most likely receive. No old, holiday clearance bin Kcups in this assortment!  :)

review/text: I was leery about purchasing a variety pack because there had been a lot of negative reviews about duplicates and boring selections for the other variety packs available on Amazon. I took the chance, anyway, and this purchase was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />Inside there were 35 different flavors, as advertised, including about six teas, two hot cocoas and six flavors of decaf. Yes, there were a lot of flavors from Green Mountain and Tully's, but there were also some really cool flavors from Coffee People and other brands, as well.<br /><br />I was expecting the package arrive in a box, however, it came in a brown paper bag that was simply stapled and shipped. Everything arrived in good condition, though, so who am I to complain.<br /><br />If you're looking for a true selection of 35 different flavors, this one is the one for you.

review/summary: Dislike - Not what's described.
review/text: Dislike this assorment of K-cups; came in brown paper bag more like someone purchased coffee and all that they disliked they resold.  This was more a mix of teas not coffee.  I will never buy from this seller again.  Mix did not include any Apple Ciders and few I would say approximately 5 k-cups of coffee the rest was teas and decafs.  Hate this assortment.<br /><br />Lydia,

review/summary: Dirty, bad selection!
review/text: My husband is overseas and wanted to surprise me with a variety of coffee to try as I recently purchased a Keurig coffee maker. This order arrived in a brown paper bag stapled together with an expiration date of 8-23-12 written on it (it's almost June so not much time to consume these!). I was hesitant to even open the bag it just seemed a little strange to pack K-Cups this way (another order he sent me through a different seller came in unopened BOXES). I opened the bag to find DIRTY K-cups inside! Gross. There were crumbs of some sort stuck around the rim of a few cups. A few more felt hard as rocks as though they had been exposed to moisture somehow. I was completely taken aback. It seemed as though someone picked through the flavors and threw all the ones they did not want in this bag. Lots of decaf coffee, teas, one hot chocolate and a few other random coffee's I have never heard of were included. Needless to say, I will not be consuming any of these due to the packaging as it did not seem sanitary.

review/text: I ordered this from Liquid nation and what I received was not as described. First of all I didn't receive all different K-cup as promised. I had recieved multiple duplicates in my package as well as 9 that had expired last year. I also received one K-cup that was clearly punctured in multiple locations on the top. I tried to contact the company of the poor quality of the item, but have yet to hear anything. Do not order!!<br /><br />Correction: The company corrected the mistake, and replaced the faulty/expired K-cups.

review/text: Great assortment of K-cups. I thought there was going to be 2-3 of the same kind of coffee, nope! EVERY k-cup is different. This was my first order of k-cups and it gives me a good sample of what flavors are my favorite and what to order in the future. This assortment would also be ideal for parties because it has plenty of decafs, teas, and even hot chocolate! This coffee is great tasting and fresh. Other reviews mentioned that some K-cups were expired and broken upon delivery. All my K-cups were sealed, none were broken or smashed during shipping. K-cups did come in a brown plastic bag that was just stapled shut, but the bag was placed in a box and therefore package was not damaged. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase!

review/summary: Not that great/empty, moldy pods
review/text: I admit I might be a bit harsh, but I am really not that satisfied with what I paid for. First, it looks like somebody just swept their arm across a shelf and dumped a bunch of random stuff in a box. I shouldn't gripe that much about packaging, BUT, as I was unpacking them and putting them away, I noticed that both of the pods from Grove square seemed a bit lite. I shook them around and they sounded empty. I opened them up to see if they were empty, and, well, you can see from my pictures what was in them. One of them looked like it had already been run through a brew cycle and then left to mold in the sun. The second one, again as you can see in the picture, was pretty much empty except for what looked like a moldy piece of pocket lint. Keep in mind that both of these pods were sealed airtight when I got them. I guess I need to blame the maker of the pods, but this is just not acceptable.<br /><br />I think it is safe to say I WILL NOT EVER be buying anything like this again and would highly advise others to look elsewhere as well

review/text: These are someone's rejects thrown in a brown paper bag. 25 of the 35 cups were not from the brands they show. The package contained 1 Gloria Jean Butter Toffee, 1 Timothy's Kahlua, 1 Emeril (wow real coffee), 1 Donut House Chocolate Glazed donut, and lots of off brand flavored stuff, teas, coco etc.. There are 8 Brooklyn K cups which get terrible reviews. We are afraid to even use them since the reviews state they tend to explode and make a mess of the coffee maker.  It's junk and there is a no return policy.

review/text: I would not recommend this to anyone.  I didn't read the other reviews before I placed my order which I know was my fault.  The K-Cups arrived in a brown paper bag, stapled with a hot pink sticky-note on it.  And that in my opinion is pretty ghetto.  Some of them were dented so who knows where each of them has been and I am not even going to use them.  Wasted funds because you can't return them either.<br /><br />My friend ordered a sampler pack described just like this. His came in a box with each K-Cup individually seated and looked like an actual product.  Not something that someone is taking from their school or work and then reselling them on Amazon.

review/summary: This is definitely a big gamble.....
review/text: I was so anxious to get my assortment of K-cups so I could try before I buy big packages.  Well, they arrived yesterday, and much to my dismay, many of the ones pictured are missing.  I saw the notation that they may be replaced, but my word, the variety I received is less than satisfactory.  I have an abundance of tea/cider that I refuse to drink.  Gross!  I have an abundance of plain coffee and decaf....decaf?  Are you serious?  That's like taking a bath with your clothes on, IMO.  If I wanted decaf, I wouldn't be ordering coffee at all.  That just defeats the purpose of coffee totally.  If I wanted plain coffee, I didn't need to try before I buy, either.  I have several hot chocolates....if I wanted that, I'd have ordered it.  I don't need to try cocoa before buying.  Besides, I'm diabetic, and I can't drink them....unless they are sugar free.  What I don't have is a big variety of flavored coffee that I wanted.  I did get three flavors I wanted to try, but the cinnamon roll and mocha nut fudge were not included, so I can't try those.  I think the mudslide is horrible...tastes like coconut.  I think the butter toffee is bitter and doesn't have a toffee flavor at all.  The chocolate glazed donut is doable but it's not the best thing ever.  There are 3 others that I will try, southern pecan, french vanilla supreme, and caramel cappuccino.  So, out of 35 cups, I got 6 to try.  It basically was a complete waste of money, IMO.  So now I'm stuck with a dilemma....do I buy a big box of flavors and hope that I like them enough to continue drinking them or do I put the Mr. Coffee single-cup maker I just bought in a cabinet and forget it?  That would be another big waste of money.  I already wasted $20 on a carousel that doesn't live up to its description...the K-cups do NOT fit in there properly and fall out.  It does NOT hold 35 cups at all.  You have to skip every other one for them to fit.  Piece of junk.  I had to order a different one that holds less cups and isn't a carousel :-(  This whole ordeal just stinks.....and just an FYI here:  I ordered all this because I missed my English Toffee cappuccino (that I can't have any longer as it's not sugar free) and was hoping I could find a decent replacement with K-cups.  I lost this battle :-(  Buyer beware unless you like regular and decaf coffees, cocoa, tea, and cider......

But I wasn't expecting a third of my shipment to be flavors/brands that weren't listed (that I don't like.) I am very disappointed that there was only 1 Gloria Jean's, 1 Caribou, and 1 Timothy's, and only 1 flavored Donut Shop coffee.  I am also very disappointed that there were only 3 tea varieties, and NO iced tea flavors! I wonder had they not put 9 k-cups in my package that I didn't want to order, if I would have gotten more of the varieties I ordered this for. But I have company coming tomorrow, so I guess I'll run out to BBB and buy some different non-coffee flavors in person so the non-coffee drinkers have something to choose from.

review/text: When I received the package, I was excited to see what was included.  I pulled out all of the K-cups out of the brown paper bag (what is up with that?) and as I was doing so, I noticed some of the cups rattling.  To see why these were rattling, I opened up one of the K-cups to discover a hard brown lump of coffee sitting on the bottom of the cup, yuck!  I took pictures of the cup to upload to the review; however, that option is not available on Amazon's site.  Believe me, it was not pretty!

review/summary: A coffee medley
review/text: I purchased this coffee medley because it looked good in the advertisement. When I got it, the medley was TOO diverse and contained stuff I did not like.

review/summary: Big let down
review/text: It seems like a lot of the kinds they couldn't sell. This seems like it would great if you didn't drink cofee but wanted a mix for your office or to have for your fiends who drink coffee. 9 were not coffee- I knew there would be a few but 9? 5 of them were decafe.  There were only 5 flavors that were light (like mudslide). I guess I didn't look close enough at the description.  I wanted a yummy coffee mix- this was not it.  I would never buy this again!

review/text: I was very unhappy when I received my order today, I only had three different flavored coffees, I received 6 different favors of tea and all the rest were regular coffee, although there were different companies I received 5 house blend....I was hoping for some iced coffee and iced teas and received none. I will not purchase this variety pack again.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I read the previous reviews and decided to take a chance, but I was one of the disappointed ones. A great variety of coffee, but only 4 teas and NO hot chocolate or cider. I don't like coffee or tea so I'm not happy with this selection. I understand the concept of how this vendor is creating an assortment so you don't have to buy a whole package of each flavor, but how hard would it be to just make sure there are at least some of everything promised in the assortment.

review/summary: A hit
review/text: I ordered this shortly after getting my Keurig. It was the first bulk order of K-Cups I had placed, and I am very pleased with the results! True to their word, there were 35 completely different selections. I put them all on my K-Cup Carousel.<br /><br />When I wake up I generally am too dead to the world to peruse a wide selection, so I generally stick with the store bought boxes of one of my favorites for that, but this selection has been a conversation piece and source of much joy when I have company over. Lots of "ooohs" and "hmmms." The only downside is that I am going to have to start cutting off/charging my friends!! I just ordered the 50 pack Sampler and I'm almost giddy about it.

review/summary: Some of the sampler arrived open
review/text: I have Keurig at works and I drank variety of brewers all the time.  Finally decide to buy a unit at home for myself.  Amazon sales it in a bundle and it looks like a good deal, so I bought the samplers.  It is unfortunately a wrong thing to do.  I don't know whether it is due to the pressure during the shipments, several cups lose their tight seal upon arrival.  We didn't notice until we put it in the unit and some of the coffee grounds leaked it into the cup.  I also notice some sampler tasted stale.  Perhaps it is from the shipper, but it is bad.  You will be better off just go to Publics, Target, or Beals to buy them fresh.<br />About a third of the items on this 35 different sampler amount to either lose sealed or bad taste items.  I don't know if it is even possible to ask for a refund?  Does it worth my time and postage to mail them back??

This really doesn't bother me - I don't think of them as expired, they are "best before". Still, if it were more than three and worth the effort, I might ask for replacements.<br /><br />I'm perfectly happy. It was kind of like opening a Christmas stocking.

review/summary: Very Dissapointed :(
review/text: Well, I am very dissapointed in this package as I got ALOT of the "same" coffees that were of different Brands(and they were mostly regular coffees).  I got ALOT of the "Bold" coffees which I cannot stand.  Some of the coffees were outdated.  The oldest was outdated September of 2011 (so far).  NOT ONE cocoa, NOT ONE Apple Cider, NOT ONE Iced Coffee, NOT ONE Iced Tea.  I got very few of the flavored coffees which is what I was hoping for and I really wanted the Cocoa and Apple cider.  I have a 7yr old daughter who would have LOVED the cocoa!  And I couldn't wait for my husband to try the Apple Cider that he loves.  The only thing good about this package is that it came fast (of course, that was thanks to Amazon Prime shipping).  I will not order from these people again unless they make it RIGHT with me!!!  Had it been a good shipment I would have ordered over and over again, as I entertain alot.

review/text: Mostly decaf. I won't order this mix again. While I knew there would be a few in the mix I assumed it would be mostly caffeine. Lots of teas. At least 2 of the cups are past the "best before" date. One of the cups had been cut open & had leaked coffee grounds in the package. I'm not very satisfied.

review/summary: Great for a new owner
review/text: If you are a new keurig owner, this is a great variety pack to see what is out there.  I got regular, decaf, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, cappuccino, and even "brew over ice" products.  Yes, the packaging is a little funny - once I got a brown paper bag and once a very generic looking box.  However, from what I can tell, all the sellers of this type of k-cup variety product are home based businesses, so that seems to be the standard.  And if you look around, cup for cup, this is a good price.  Will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Several Near-Empty Cups
review/text: We order these for our office on a regular basis. While not every cup is absolutely unique, that has never bothered us. For the most part, there is always a good mix, even if a few are duplicates.<br /><br />However, in every recent batch that we have purchased, there have been a few cups that were nearly empty. You can tell by shaking them. We tried brewing a few of these to verify that we were not just assuming they should be full. And, I would not recommend this, as the coffee they produce is absolutely horrible.<br /><br />It is very apparent these are defective cups. I thought it was an anomaly at first, but I found 3 more in our most recent order. All of them that suffer from this problem tend to be from Grove Square, in our experience.<br /><br />1. Until this issue is resolved, I think customers should expect to throw away 2-5 cups upon arrival. So, consider the price as if you were purchasing around 30 cups.<br />2. The seller of this product should seriously consider dropping the Grove Square cups until this is resolved.<br />3. The seller should consider doing quick quality assurance by simply shaking the cup before packing it.<br /><br />That said, we will likely continue to purchase this product since it is a great deal, but if the issue gets worse, we will probably look elsewhere.<br /><br />See the customer image I posted of the near empty cups from our most recent order.<br /><br />UPDATE: After a few more empty cups, we have decided to go with other options. It was not worth it to throw out around 5 cups from every batch when other K-Cup options are getting cheaper and cheaper.

review/summary: Won't Buy Again
review/text: I knew I was rolling the dice with this mixed grab bag.  Based on some of the positive reviews, I took a chance.  Couldn't be more disappointed.  One third of the k cups are the cheap Grove Square  brand...some of which I immediately through away because they shook like a rattle with a dried up "chunk" of coffee in them.  The others sound like they have about a teaspoon of dried up indtant coffee grounds in them.  No comparison to any of the other k cup brands. Grove Square sells for approximately half the price of other k cup brands in retail stores. That is because it is instant coffee designed to look like a k cup.  Makes the purchase price of this mix really steep since one third of my k cups were these cheapies!  I tried them once before and to me they are absolutely undrinkable. Should note that the product picture and written description does not show or mention Grove Square as one of the possible brands in the mix.  I also got 4 teas, 4 decafs and about 10 flavored coffees.  Overall, a horrible mix that was not worth the price I paid.  Won't risk it again. Unless you like the taste of instant coffee or are willing to overpay per cup to get to try some other actual k cup brands in different flavors...don't buy this.

review/text: There was a lot of variety in the pack, which I greatly appreciate and I'm excited to try all of these new flavors!  There are even several teas and cappuccino's, which are very nice.  However, the quality assurance could have been much better handled prior to shipping.  I had to throw out two of the k-cups as soon as they arrived because the contents of the coffee inside were literally hard (they were more than likely expired.)  Also, they were not carefully packaged and just all thrown into a box with some paper thrown in there.  If you're ordering this, expect to throw a couple of them out from the onset.

review/text: I was not sure about this product. Placing my order was a gamble. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box. Shipping was fast, it was at my door several days before the deadline. Package was undamaged, I received 37 K-cups, instead of 35. All were in date and there were no doubles. Not all of the brands pictured were sent to me, but that was fine with me.<br /><br />The only thing I noticed about this product is that the price jumped significantly after I ordered it. I am very happy with my order and will order from this company again, once the price goes back down.<br /><br />Whitney

review/text: I ordered three (ugh!) of these sampler packages intended as gifts to people to whom I had previously given Keurig's.  What a disppointment to see that they come in distasteful brown paper bag packaging with a 90 day expiration sticker right on the front!  Shame on me for not reading all the details closer and the reviews ahead of time, which I now see have the same complaints about shoddy packaging and what appears to be someone's leftover flavors.  Buyer beware!
