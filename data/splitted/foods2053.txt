review/summary: The Best!
review/text: These dried mangoes are the best! The taste and texture is perfect and delicious. Whenever I share them with friends, they always want to know where they can get them. They also have the unfortunate tendency to eat all of mine. I ordered these for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I already need to put in my third order. The only setback is that these are not cheap, though I do believe they're worth it.

review/summary: Looking For More.
review/text: These dried mangos are excellent. I picked them up at Costco and was hesitant because the bag was so large. False problem. These Philippine Brand dried mangos are excellent. Perhaps they might be a little higher in sugar than I would like, but they really taste good. They're nice and chewy and have excellent, although highly variable from piece to piece, flavor. Good product. I'm down to the bottom of the bag and looking for more.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: I have other brands and they can be very stringy & hard to chew or just not as sweet. This is the best brand of dried mangos I've ever had. This is also a GREAT deal as this is a 10oz bag. Even way cheaper than you could get them at WalMart. Also since they are dried they last a long time (I think the usual expiration date on them is about a year and I bet they are probably good past that. Thus making them a great survival food to stock up on).

review/text: I have been buying these for years from Walmart and Sam's, but this is the best price I have found so far. There are a few tough, chewy pieces, but not so many to stop me from coming back for more. These are lightly sweetened which I really like because fruit is already sweet. They are a great, healthy snack and quite the luxury.

review/text: Years ago we would purchase dried mango in bulk, and it was always a treat for our family. For my son's BD last week, I wanted to surprise him with some.I read a lot of reviews of the different brands of dried mango, and this one looked like it was the winner! Mmmmmm! Mmmmmm! Mmmmmm! We have tasted and then eaten and eaten and fallen in love with these mango!! We've not had any tough fiber ones in the two bags we finished (as mentioned by other reviewer); all have been perfectly sweet and had just the right amount of chewy! We've already placed another order. Unfortunately they probably should be eaten in moderation as they are not zero calories.

I was surprised at how many broken ones were in each packet.<br /><br />Buying a whole case at a time makes for a very affordable treat whether you are dieting or not.  Overall, I ended up stashing the box in the garage and will bring it back out when I am on the maintenence part of the HCG Diet.  These little treats are so tempting that I found myself wanting more than the recommended 2 per day :)<br /><br />I also recommend:<br />Stevia Clear Liquid Vanilla Creme 2 Ounces<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H23X2S">Old London Melba Toast, Classic, 5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Great breadsticks for the HCG diet
review/text: The HCG diet is one hell of a great way to lose weight and Grissini breadsticks are recommended on the original protocol. It's hilarious how these crunchy little basically tasteless sticks of flour and water can become DELICIOUS when you eat 500 calories for 4 weeks composed of no carbs except for these. It's really easy to stay on the plan, to be honest, and you drop fat like crazy, but these tiny Italian treasures take on a life of their own during the process.  Melba toast doesn't stand a chance!

review/text: Ordered a case for use on the HCG diet. They taste wonderful. My only complaint is that most every box had only 2 or 3 bread sticks in tact. A huge amount of breakage, I think. And, it is a little odd to be measuring bits and pieces of cracker to assemble the equivalent of one breadstick so as to meet the requirements of the diet! That said, I will order them again, and hope that someone has figured out how to ship these yummy crackers without so much breakage.

The flavors are very subtle in all three, with spring vegetable tasting like water with a bit of celery steeped in it. With the spicy chicken, I often find myself doubling up flavor packets or draining a lot of water to taste the sauce better. Done correctly, this can be made somewhat spicy. It's also good with a splash of sriracha.

review/text: This is so delicious. I want to buy a case. I tried this today for lunch and these are the most delicious noodles Ive tasted. Fresh noodles in a savory and spicy broth. Not too spicy but just spicy enough.  Better than other instant noodle soup brands. Would recommend it to anyone who likes ramen or spicy food. Even if you're not a spicy food lover they are ok, they arent too spicy.

review/summary: worst gf baking mix EVER
review/text: this may have been one of the earliest mixes because gf food has come a LONG way from having to eat this.  The texture is gritty and the taste is bitter.  It even says on the box that it will turn out flatter, harder, and more crumbly than regular bread or biscuits---how's that for advertising?  I have tried biscuits and cookies with this mix.  Both look, feel, and taste like hockey pucks, and i KNOW it's not my cooking.  You are far better off making a mix of your own like bette hagman's classic mix of white rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch.  for pancakes and waffles, and even biscuits, use the new gluten free Bisquick-they know what they are doing, and they turn out great!  don't buy this mix.  it is expensive, and you will be disappointed.

review/summary: Need to know how to use it
review/text: I'd like to say that I really like this baking mix, but I don't know if it is for me or not. And maybe I should have known what I was buying, so I have excess boxes of flour. First of all, I've baked the biscuits on the recipes on the back of the box, and the scones. Both taste the same to me, I see no difference. Although, I've made the blueberry muffins that is also shown how to make on the back of the box too, but that is pretty much all I can make. I've tried substituting for other things, but they never turn out right because there are no instruction on how to convert recipes with all-purpose flour. This box contains baking soda and powder in it, so it is hard to gauge how much more to put in, if at all. I think if there was a way for Arrowhead Mills to provide recipes for their products, I'd recommend it. This is for people who probably know what to do with this baking mix.

review/text: My son is gluten free, and when we started the diet, the hardest part was giving up my homemade choc. chip cookies.  They were his favotire!  This mix is the only one that has brought me successful cookies, even to the point where I can serve them to the unsuspecting, and they don't know they are gluten free!  I've used it in peanut butter cookies, oatmeal cookies, and choc. chip, and have had great success!  I substitute equal amounts for the all purpose flour in the original recipe, but use about 20% coconut or almond flour, which takes away some of the bitterness and gives it the sweetness that the cookies need.

review/text: As a long time tea drinker, I have tried many kinds of green tea.  Dragonwell has the BEST flavor. I just love getting up while it is still dark out; looking out over the mountains at the stars and drinking my Dragonwell tea. One of the simple joys in life. I use to only drink loose leaf tea  since most tea bags alter the flavor way too much. This kind of bag allows the leaves to expand which preserves the true taste. I buy from this company (The Coffee Bean And Tea Leaf) when I  visit my Mom in Scottsdale, Arizona. I usually pay about $8 a can so this price on Amazon is a good deal.

Also, the company actually answers the phone with a live person if you call the number on the package! I had one pack of the 4 soup mixes I ordered from Amazon arrive missing its seasoning packet.

The Leonard Mountain 'Amigos' are favorites with my friends and family.  We didn't care to much for the others varieties but haven't tried the Peppadew Stew yet.  You get a big bang for your buck with this product since there is little prep and you can really bulk it up with lots of additions to stretch the number of portions.  We like to top it with dollop of sourcream.

review/text: I had bought this the first time in California at a grocery store for some steaks I was gonna grill. I instantly fell in love with the sauce. I tried to find this particular product here in Va Beach VA but no stores carried it. I had used other chimichurri sauces but I sorely missed this type. Surfing through Amazon website I saw that they sold this in bulk which was a Godsend. I received all six of the jars sealed in a plastic bag with plastic cushion pillows so they won't break in the box. The only problem was the lids kinda leaked a little bit of the sauce. I just washed each one and tightened each jar. If you like chimichurri you'll like this.

But I mainly use this<br />as a marinade rather than a finisher. This has a tangy herbaceous flavor<br />and you will taste the blend of garlic, parsley, olive oil, cider vinegar<br />and oregano. Want more flavor, add your own herbs or garlic.<br /><br />It can also be used as a spread with bread or to add a boost to vegetables,<br />salads and soups. And while mainly used for steak, this stuff works really<br />well on fish and grilled shrimp too or for making Bruchetta, or even just<br />with cheese and crackers. Its very versatile and you will find any number<br />of uses for this terrific concoction.

review/summary: Questionable Quality
review/text: Recently I decided to switch my French Bulldog to Royal Canin Bulldog 24 after he developed food allergies. Royal Canin came highly recommended from our vet and being "specially formulated for a Bulldog's needs" I thought this food would be a good fit. The label on the bag tauts features like "highly digestible proteins and starches" that reduce a Bulldog's rather active digestive system. In my experience it doesn't.<br /><br />I was skeptical too of the ingredients list which lists the first ingredients as: Chicken meal, rice, brown rice, oatmeal, soy protein isolate, rice flour, chicken fat, and natural chicken flavor. For an "ultra-premium" brand this is not an impressive list of ingredients. Similarly priced dog foods like Canidae, Solid Gold, Wellness, Innova, and Orijen feature ingredients like chicken off the bone and other high quality sources of protein as the main ingredients.<br /><br />After about 3 weeks of struggling with my pup's very loose stool, gas and all around lethargy I decided enough was enough and stopped feeding my dog Royal Canin. In the meantime I decided to educate myself on dog food, the ingredients and the manufacturing processes. I think that although many of the premium dog food brands on the market now are certainly better than run-of-the-mill grocery brand dog foods, there is still a lot to be desired.<br /><br />I think that the bottom line when it comes to Royal Canin (and many other dog food brands) is that many of the large corporations who produce these dog foods do not have you or your dogs best interests at heart. Royal Canin is now fully owned by the Mars/Masterfood Group - a massive conglomerate that makes everything from candy bars to dog food.<br /><br />In short I think that whatever was once Royal Canin - is now something different altogether. That something being a company more mindful of it's bottom line and marketing practices than the ingredients in their product.<br /><br />I really recommend anyone interested in Royal Canin to do a bit more research and compare to the other brands I mentioned above. In most cases you can get a better food for the same price.<br /><br />Most definitely not recommended.

review/summary: Poor quality, full of bugs
review/text: The wheat I received was either old or stored improperly. Weevils (bugs) are an unavoidable aspect of whole grains. All grains have weevil eggs in them. But when you buy grains, they should be free of mature, live bugs when they arrive, and they should stay that way for a long time. When you buy organic brown rice, do you expect to find bugs in it when you get home? No. With proper storage, it should remain bug-free for the shelf life of the grain. After sifting through several cups, the bug problem forced me to toss this wheat.<br /><br />Another complaint is that the wheat was not very well cleaned. I had to remove a lot of foreign seeds and the occasional small rock.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: First of all, remember that they are what they are: sugar-free candies. Sugar substitutes generally create laxative effects, depending on the person, that can range from mild gassiness to, well, let's not get into that. I think more than one piece is safe--at least 3 or 4 in most cases--but it depends on you. And that's not the fault of the candy, it's the territory in general--most, if not all such candies have that effect.<br /><br />That said, this is one of my favorite diabetic-friendly candies. They taste very much like the sugary ones I ate as a child. Everyone will have their favorite flavors, but the selection they have is bound to be most satisfying; the flavors are good, the taste well-crafted.<br /><br />The one drawback I found: if left too long, they will start to congeal or melt in the wrappers. One time I ordered them and it took a month or two for this to start happening; another time I ordered them, they were already starting to go.<br /><br />All told, it's a product I will be buying often over time.

Bai was the perfect way to start my day. It was a nice pick me up and never gave me the shakes. Now, I'm hooked on it and it's replaced my morning joe!

The low calorie/low glycemic response was the first thing that caught his eye, but the flavor cinched the deal.  Not too sweet and true-to-the-fruit.  No weird after taste.  All the low-cal flavors were amazing (to us, though, the citrus reminded us of old time Tang) but blueberry was our favorite.  We are really enjoying this refreshing and power-packed drink.

review/text: Jamaica Blueberry is my favorite of the bai flavors, coming in slightly ahead of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JLQ6UE">Panama Peach</a>. The taste is reminiscent of a slice of Maine blueberry pie -- kind of sweet, kind of tart, but not over-powering or sugary. Using Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" program, I keep my fridge stocked with two cases of bai5, getting it delivered on a monthly basis. It's a cold, caffeinated alternative to soda and is healthier (and more flavorful in my opinion) than Snapple, Honest Tea, or Nantucket Nectars. There aren't a lot of blueberry drinks out there; so if you like blueberries, this is the drink for you. While not five calories, like the "bai5" varietals, the 140 calories is well worth it.

review/text: I am just wild about this product. Being in my late 30's I am all about health and self preservation. So I needed a drink that would both taste great and be good for my well being.  The flavor of the blueberries just flows with out being overly powerful.  I enjoy this drink with my meals and when I just need a pick me up, Jamaica Blueberry over ice is perfect. There is hardly any caffine to talk about and the axtioxidents make me feel good about myself after have it.  This is the best flavor that bai makes and I recommend it to anyone looking for an healthy alternative to the usual junk drinks that are out there.

review/text: Jamaica Blue Berry Bai is my favorite flavor. It isn't too sweet or strong, it's just right. I've been drinking these almost daily for over a year and I'm happy to say that I've been much less sick with head colds, viruses, etc. than I have ever been. I believe in this stuff like some people swear by Airborne but I think this works better cause it prevents me from getting sick in the first place. It tastes great and keeps mine and my family's immune systems stronger. Gotta love it!

review/text: I tried the Blueberry Bai a few weeks ago and I was really impressed with how smooth the flavor is. Blueberry-flavored drinks tend to be overpowering, but Bai gets it right with this one. The "energy" doesn't make me jittery, but rather more alert without a crash later. I'd recommend this to anyone, it's the perfect alternative for anyone looking for a boost that doesn't want to resort to more coffee or a sugary energy drink

review/summary: Very Tasty - And a Great use of the Coffee Berry!
review/text: Although it uses (organic &lt;:-) cane juice as a sweetener, it did not give me the usual sugar crash that other sweetened fruit drinks do. I though the taste was wonderful -- not bitter, not too sweet -- very blueberry-ish. And it's abut time someone used the "once forgettable" and often discarded coffee berry, which in fact was what led to the discovery of the coffee bean itself.<br /><br />bai contains caffeine in abundance but also in abundance are the antioxidants -- so this is a good fruity fun drink that gives you a lift, and IS good for you. Nothing artificial here.

review/summary: Ideal drink
review/text: Bai products are the ideal beverages for the twenty-first century. Using a base of half a liter of filtered spring water they are satisfying thirst quenchers while stimulating the taste buds with exotic fruit flavors satisfying the innate craving for sweets.  For anyone focused on fitness they provide hydration before, during and after physical activity and simultaneously neutralize the free radicals automatically generated by exercise with a natural antioxidant infusion. Dieters and the health-minded can safely incorporate these low and very low calorie drinks into their plans without concern about the documented harmful effects of fructose and artificial sweeteners. They compliment food and snacks and by themselves  are refreshing pick ups. Try a Bai and you'll keep on buying.

review/summary: A Horse Is a Horse Is a Snack, Of Course
review/text: My dog is constantly out to get me. Keeping little miss 'Princess Paws' from rooting through the trash, diddling the carpets or wrecking the house is like trying to keep Lindsey Lohan out of dive bars, crack dens and paparazzi mug shots. In other words -- nearly impossible.<br /><br />But lord help me, I try.<br /><br />I bought a bag of these biscuits, thinking I could coax the mutt into good behavior through 'positive reinforcement'. Though the idea sort of fizzles when the dog is too finicky to eat the stupid things. She gave the tiniest of disinterested exploratory sniffs, then scrunched her furry little schnozz like I was offering her a handful of barf-encrusted crap.<br /><br />(Which, based on her previous dietary choices, she would actually eat. Tasty baked tidbit? No, thanks; I'm trying to keep my greyhoundish figure.<br /><br />The poop du jour in half-digested BLEEEH-rnaise sauce? Mmmm-mmmm! Bon appeturd!)<br /><br />I tried to entice her, but she wasn't having it. I even tried a little nibble myself, to prove I wasn't trying to poison her. (Yet.)<br /><br />And actually, the biscuit was pretty good. It's got a nice crunch, with a taste somewhere between a heavy water cracker and reconstituted horse meal. But pretty light on the 'horse meal' part. All in all, not bad. I'd give it about a four on the people-food scale -- somewhere between a stale bag of Funyuns and a plain rice cake eaten off a sweaty Clydesdale's back. I finished the first one and had another. Pretty soon I'd gone through half the bag.<br /><br />So this was a complete waste for the dog. But I found a new snack for TV nights. Now if I'm out of popcorn, I set out a bowl of biscuits and munch away. They're not gourmet. But they're filling, and I'm getting my recommended daily allowance of hoof meat all in one sitting. That's a winner.
