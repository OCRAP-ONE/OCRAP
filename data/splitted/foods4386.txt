review/summary: My first "expensive" cheese
review/text: I first received this cheese from a cheese club. Tasted so good I actually went hunting for it online because it's not available locally. The price threw me a bit but decided I was well worth it. The cheese has the perfect amount of saltiness to suit my taste. I use it grated on everything that I would normally grate cheese on - and some things that don't normally get cheese. Shreds of it in a salad give the dish a boost. I've added it to macaroni and cheese, grilled cheese sandwiches, and cheese grits! Have not found anything yet that it's not good with. It's great just to nibble on also.

review/summary: Dinner Is Served!
review/text: Who knew dog food could be this delicious, this nutritious, this fun to serve? How can you go wrong with a product named "Stella & Chewy's" -- the name alone makes you want to hug the package.<br /><br />But dogs can't read. So the real test came when I opened the package and popped out the dry, puck-sized wafer and put it in front of Madeleine, our 4.5 lb Papillon. Madeleine gobbled it down like she hadn't had a thing to eat in months. Sold.<br /><br />What's in the wafers? Freeze-dried, RAW farm raised chicken with no imitation anything. It's also CERTIFIED safe raw and pathogen free food.<br /><br />Do I trust those words? In today's FDA-scammed market, they aren't what they used to be.  And yet, the whole package just seems to ooze with clues this company is ethical, responsible, progressive, and aware of the potential damage "ordinary" dog food brings to the table. I just have a feeling this company knows more about perfecting the domestic dog diet than I do.<br /><br />This stuff is "Made in Wisconsin" according to the emblem on the front, but there's French writing all over the place. That's because Stella & Chewys' LLC is exporting their gourmet dog food to France, complying with French law by pointing out that it is indeed "Fabrique aux Etats-Unis" and it is "Nourriture pour chiens".<br /><br />Given the exchange rate and the shipping costs, by the time it reaches the Left Bank, it must cost a bundle.  And worth every Franc.<br /><br />Botttom line: I think these people at Stella & Chewy's care about the same things I care about. That may be irrelevant in the business world.  Profits are hard enough to come by these days.<br /><br />But they aren't cutting any corners in Chewy's Chicken Dinner.  Because it's a healthy blend of this, that and the other thing, it's even healthier than, say, pure Chicken or Steak right off the dinner table.  This has fruits and vegetables mixed in (organic blueberries, apples, carrots, squash, beets, broccoli, cranberries and pumpkin seeds).  That's important for a happy, healthy dog.  No wonder Madeleine is hooked.

review/summary: Great for travel!
review/text: My dog is on a raw diet, which is impractical when traveling.  I feed Stella & Chewy's freeze-dried food during trips and it works out beautifully. The patties may be re-hydrated or fed dry - my dog loves them either way.<br /><br />IMO the true measure of dog food's quality is the dog's "output."  I'm happy to report that whenever my dog eats this food for a few days his stools are *normal* without any dietary upset whatsoever, despite the fact there's often stress involved in travel.<br /><br />Some people feed this food as a main diet, but it can get expensive depending on the size of your dog.<br /><br />If you're dabbling in raw feeding or need a practical alternative for traveling, buy Stella & Chewy's without hesitation.  It's a great product and all of the flavors are delicious according to my dog.  :-)

review/summary: Perfection.
review/text: A friend of mine got a free bag of this of gave me a few patties that i crumbled to serve as treats, he loved them so much that i searched for a deal and bought him a couple of bags. He LOVES them. Firstly, if my dog was not a toy size dog I would not be feeding him this very often, it is EXPENSIVE. For my 8lb it would be 3 large bags a month, $80. So no way. I find a way to get discounts and it ends up being $60/mo for an 8lb pup.<br /><br />The packaging says your dog should drink 1/4 cup water for every patty, so i make sure i serve them re-hydrated so that i don't have to worry that he's drinking enough water afterward. He gobbles it up without fail.<br /><br />They are easy to measure, for my dog's size he eats about 3 1/4 patties a day, I break the patty into quarters and put them in water to rehydrate; they are ready to serve in less than 2 minutes. The ingredients are awesome and not only do they include all the meat products as the first ingredients but then vegetables that follow are organic. And to top it off they include probiotics for intestinal health.<br /><br />I can't report any increase in energy or anything like that because my dog is only 2 years old so he's got all the energy in the world. But i love that raw-type foods, even if not the frozen kind, are very easy to digest compared to dry food, that's always better for the system.<br /><br />Anyway, we've only tried this flavor so far, duck is next. : )<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken Ground with Bone, Chicken Liver, Chicken Gizzard, Pumpkin Seed, Potassium Chloride, Organic Cranberries, Organic Spinach, Organic Broccoli, Organic Beets, Sodium Phosphate Monobasic, Organic Carrots, Organic Squash, Organic Apples, Organic Blueberries, Choline Chloride, Dried Pediococcus Acidilactici Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophilus Fermentation Product, Dried Bifidobacterium Longum Fermentation Product, Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Taurine, Tocopherols (Preservative), Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Zinc Sulfate, Iron Sulfate, Iron Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Niacin, Copper Sulfate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Sulfate, Sodium Selenite, Manganese Proteinate, Thiamine Monohydrate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin B12 Supplement.

review/summary: FIRE HAZARD!
review/text: I bought the Kettle Corn variety Pop-Up Bowl. The first bag I tried to pop totally burned within 12 seconds (with smoke pouring out of the microwave), well before it was even fully popped, and the second bag, which I set on a lower temperature (even though it specifically says to use HIGH) actually caught on fire! Avoid this fire trap product at all costs. To avoid throwing all the rest of the bags out, I settled for cutting the bags open, scraping the contents into a heavy, lidded-skillet, and cooking it old-school. Those came out fine, as there's nothing the matter with the popcorn, just the packaging. So, unless you have a desire to destroy a perfectly good microwave, and possibly burn down your house in the process, avoid this packaging at all costs. Mark my words, this is going to come up in the future. The Orville Redenbacher brand is going to see lawsuits for this one! I wanted to give it ZERO STARS, but the program wouldn't let me! Be forewarned!

review/summary: Potential fire hazard
review/text: I'm a sucker for convenience, but with two kids and a job - do you really blame me? I'm the stereotypical busy mom, and I thought these would be great. I bought the popcorn in early August but quickly forgot about it as we moved into the fall months. While cleaning our pantry, I re-discovered them.<br /><br />Today I thought it would make a great addition to my lunch. I went to the break room, popped it on and waited patiently.<br /><br />It was still popping when I pulled out, but it just smelled burnt.<br /><br />To my surprise, it was. Not only that, but the bag had sprung a leak. Unpopped kernels and butter leaked out. Had I let it go the full 2 minutes, we would have been facing a massive fire. Cleaning the microwave after that was bad enough, but having to deal with the possible problems it could have caused? Even worse.<br /><br />I've only used one bag, but I'm throwing the rest of the box away. A fire hazard isn't worth it.

review/summary: Orville is rolling in his grave
review/text: So far, I've popped two bags (bowls) and both times, I've ended up with burnt popcorn, and many, many unpopped kernals.  These two things (burnt popcorn and large volumes of unpopped kernals) shouldn't occur together.  My guess is that this is the result of the grey heat reflector portion of the bag being smaller to accomodate the removable "bowl" lid.  So there is less surface area for the popcorn to be in contact with this reflector.  I will definitely not be purchasing any more boxes of these dumb "bowls" in the future.  It was a good idea, but very poorly executed.  Orville is surely rolling in his grave over the number of unpopped kernals with his name on them!

review/summary: Low Quality Product
review/text: A few observations on this product:<br />- The pop-up bowl sells for a premium over the regular bag version yet it seems to be worse.<br />- Is this really a bowl or just a paper bag held sideways? There is big difference between the portrayal on the package and the product inside. The "bowl" end result will not look like the package illustration but more like a paper hat partially filled with popcorn.<br />- The product did not cook as well as the bag version and actually came out a bit scorched. It seems to make less popcorn than the bag version, and is definitely not like portrayal of the product on the box in which popcorn overflows from the "pop-up bowl."<br /><br />Overall, this product seems like an interesting idea that was executed on the cheap. And the problem is compounded by charging a premium to the consumer.  The company is degrading its image by putting out this product under the Orville Redenbacher brand name.

review/summary: Sprayed orange grease all over the inside of the microwave
review/text: The pop-up bowl sounds like a great idea, but evidently they rushed it to market before all the bugs were out.<br /><br />The first bag I cooked was fine, except the instructions for opening the bag are far from clear, and even after you figure out how to do it it's a lot of trouble and makes a big mess.<br /><br />But the second bag evidently sprang a leak - it sprayed bright orange grease all over the inside of my microwave, even into the tiny vent holes inside the top and side. I always watch popcorn carefully while it pops, but I could not see the grease spray until after it was done and I opened the door. Cleaning it all out was a horrible ordeal, and I'm sure everything I cook in the microwave will come out smelling like popcorn grease for weeks.<br /><br />They released this product too soon. It needs serious redesign. I will not buy it again.

review/summary: Flawed design
review/text: I loved the idea of popcorn that would pop in its own bowl. I gave it a try tonight as I settled in to watch a movie. The first thing I noticed as it popped was that the sides of the bag were a red see through type of material so you could see the popcorn popping. Not sure if that's needed but I liked it so it was a plus. The "bowl" was disappointing though. Essentially, its just a bag of popcorn that you place on it's side, rip the side off & you eat the popcorn this way so you have a wide opening to eat from. Problem is, where you tear the side off doesn't work well. I followed the directions and found the area that is supposed to rip off didn't go smoothly & part of it didn't tear where it should & I ended up having to go back & rip more areas off, etc. Perhaps with practice you can get it right but it was a little underwhelming. The popcorn was a little bland also. Great idea but poor design. Hopefully someone will improve on it.

review/text: Either the people who have reviewed this product are idiots, or they've greatly improved the product design by the time I bought it. Please take note. The 'popcorn button' on your microwave sucks. Stand there for the 2-3 minutes it takes and listen for the popping to slow. When there's 10-15 (if not less) delay in between, you have perfect popcorn.<br /><br />The bowls were nice. The top ripped off easily all but one time. Don't know what happened there, but I'm willing to chalk it up to a human error on my part. The only part I didn't like was they left very little room to shake up the popcorn and equally distribute salt.

review/summary: Pop Up Bowl is Terrible
review/text: The bowl bag does not pop in the same amount of time as a normal bag so it makes your microwave's popcorn button useless. Additionally, about half of the bags are faulty and open when popping resulting in very little popped popcorn. Last, I have found it almost impossible to get the bag to pop completely even when watching it pop (since I can't use the popcorn button!). Overall, this new bowl design is terrible and I would recommend switching to another brand until they go bag to the old bags that work.

review/summary: Ripoff
review/text: In all of the groceries that I've been to in my area, these new "Pop-Up Bowls" of popcorn are replacing the traditional bags.  But the price for the new bowls is always the same as the price for the old bags, and there was 13% more popcorn in the older bags (3.3 oz bags, vs. 2.9 oz bowls).  This seems to be another in a series of sly moves by food retailers to disguise significant price hikes by subtle quantity reductions, like Tropicana did when they reduced their cartons from 64 oz to 59 oz.  The old bags were fine, and I'd much rather have 13% more popcorn than the new bowl.  If Redenbacher had been honest about the price hike, and charged 13% more but kept the quantity the same; or if they offered a choice between the old larger bags and the new smaller bowls instead of outright replacing the bags with the bowls, then I could respect this change.  But given how they've made this change, I'm shopping for a new brand (Central Market, mabye?).

review/summary: My daughters love it.
review/text: My teenage daughters think this is the best-tasting microwave popcorn there is (although it's a bit buttery for my tastes as I'm used to the dry diet kind) and they love the bowl.<br /><br />It felt awkward to pull the top off the first time, but now that we've done it about a dozen times, it's really easy.  Hold the bag where indicated and pull the red plastic up from one corner.  It's neatest if you pull it about halfway and then repeat from the other side, otherwise a few pieces inevitably end up on the counter.  This takes a total of about 5 seconds, there's nothing to wash, and it's much easier to eat.<br /><br />The only downside I can see is it isn't offered at my local warehouse club, so I'm stuck buying many boxes at a time, and it's expensive.  That's why I came to Amazon, and I'm hoping they carry it in large quantities soon.

review/summary: Delicious addition to espresso, hot or cold
review/text: I've been purchasing and using the sweet ground white chocolate for a few years now.  I add it to my hot espresso drinks as well as cold. It's perfect year round.  The ability to purchase it in the 3 lb can adds to the cost savings I get over going to a coffee house to get espresso.

review/summary: More than what I expected
review/text: I bought this product to try and find a white hot chocolate mix.  I will admit that this is a bit on the pricy side as it only has enough to make about 25 coffee cups worth.  The taste though is worth every cent.  I wish that I could say how great this product is in words, but I think the name Ghirardelli says it all.

review/summary: Amazing taste and aroma! Pleasant surprise!
review/text: I purchased this from Amazon after trying the Starbucks Fontana White Chocolate Sauce that I believe they use on their beverages of White Mocha. I purchased the Fontana from here but it was sold by Starbucks and let me tell you something, this stuff, the Ghirardelli is way far more superior than ANYTHING I tasted in the white chocolate beverage range. It is very aromatic, adds very nice sweet but not overly sweet notes to the beverage, let it be espresso , latte or cappuccino. it is also easy to dissolve and doesn't "clog". Also it has instructions on the back telling you how much you need for different drinks and sizes. Highly recommended, quality stuff.

review/summary: Goes great with cold beverages, not hot
review/text: The best way to have this is half a cup of it blended with ice and two shots of espresso. Takes like a white chocolate cooler. I would not recommend using this as an addition to hot drinks. It gets lost in the coffee and milk but shines when blended with ice and espresso as mentioned before. I worked in a coffee shop and we used it only for cold drinks and syrup for the hot since syrup seems to blend better in warm beverages and holds its flavor better.

review/summary: The product is awesome, ordering directly from Ghirardelli is not
review/text: First of all, I would rate this product as a 5 star product!  I've bought it for the last 12 years and LOVE it!  You have to mix it into a hot liquid or it will not dissolve, but it is AWESOME in iced white mochas!  Just mix it in with the hot shots, add milk and ice and you have yourself a sinfully delicious little treat ;)<br /><br />However...<br /><br />Buyer Beware of purchasing directly from Ghirardelli!  While the quoted shipping price was high, but reasonable, upon checkout I was only given the Expidited Shipping option without a cost break down in a large order from multiple sellers.  Only when I went into my Amazon account to check the status of an order, did I see that I was charged nearly 4 times as much in shipping and it was past the reasonable Expidited Shipping deadline!<br /><br />I have yet to hear from Ghirardelli, Amazon can not help (because I purchased from a third party seller) and I have filed a claim, so we will see...<br /><br />8/3/11 Update- Still no product.  Got a call from Ghirardelli 2 days ago stating that they would honor the quoted shipping price and send it out on next day shipping so I should have had it yesterday, but still no chocolate powder.  The most frustrating part is that they charged my card the FULL amount of the 4 times inflated shipping charge!!!!  NOW, I have to file a claim with my bank...awesome.

review/summary: Better than the current formula in the grocery store
review/text: I've never purchased this via Amazon, but we used to live in Waco, TX and were able to buy this at the Dr. Pepper Museum there (Dr. Pepper was invented in Waco). The glass bottles are the best, and the smaller size is perfect for a nice treat (they're about 100 calories each). This original recipe is better than what you buy in the store today - it has pure cane sugar as opposed to corn syrup, and you can taste the difference. Nice and crisp; a sharp sweetness that just can't be captured with corn syrup. I miss being able to drive a few miles to get this! We stocked up before we moved, but we've run out and are craving it :)<br /><br />I like how the big beverage companies are going "retro" and re-introducing their original tasty recipes with real sugar, and this is no exception. This is a great gift for yourself or a Dr. Pepper fan, because I don't think you can find it outside of Texas.

review/summary: Heaven
review/text: After trying Dublin Dr. Pepper, even if I hadn't given up HFCS and wasn't allergic to Nutra-Sweet, I would never go back to drinking "regular" Dr. Pepper again.  There's even a difference between the Dublin version and the "Heritage"/"throwback" versions that Dr. Pepper Snapple produce from time to time.  The Imperial cane sugar makes a huge difference.  This is so much better than what I've been used to.<br /><br />Update 10/21/2011:<br />I just got my second shipment. I was going through withdrawals after the first one ran out about 2 weeks ago. This stuff is addictive. If you cannot afford to keep this habit, you probably shouldn't start it.<br /><br />Update 4/25/2012:<br />Sadly, Dublin Dr. Pepper is no more. Dr. Pepper Snapple sued them and as part of the "settlement," Dublin no longer produces this soda. The bottler who was actually doing the work for Dublin Dr. Pepper also makes this soda with the same cane sugar but different packaging, but so far I've been unable to find any for sale on Amazon. I'll be kind to Amazon and not list their competitors name, but there is another site on the web that does sell the Dr. Pepper Imperial Cane Sugar version. Hopefully Amazon will do so soon.

review/summary: the drink of a lifetime
review/text: So, I grew up in Houston, and was weaned to Coca-Cola, which like every other respectable soda, was made with real cane sugar, Imperial even, because of the cane fields and processing plant SW of Houston.  Think late 40s, early 50s timeline.  Howard Hughes was brewing Grand Prize beer and Golden Age soft drinks in orange, grape and strawberry (which was called "Big Red" by my name-unconscious younger brother).  All soda came in 6 or 8 ounce bottles, except Royal Crown (RC) Cola, whose big marketing ploy was a 12 ounce bottle - "Twice as much for the same price!"  In the summer, we would visit our grandparents in Erath County, only 14 miles from the golden hub - the Dublin Dr Pepper Company.  The neighborhood grocery sold Dublin DP, and my grandfather was very fond of it. If we wanted a Coke, we had to cross the street and buy it ourselves. I drank DDP rather than blow my movie money on a difference of opinion.  As we got older, we spent fewer summer weeks at our grandparents' house, playing dominoes and drinking DDP.  That elusive flavor called to me, Mr. Pibb, various store brands that promised to taste the same, but they failed the test.  For nearly 2 years I lived in the Dublin "territory" in the 70s.  Then I moved to Austin. About 30 years ago, my father, looking for retirement, bought 3 farms in Hamilton County.<br />When we went to visit, we would bootleg Mr.Pibb into Dublin territory.  Once I discovered Hamilton County was located in DDP territory,I gave up Mr. Pibb and began doing calculations on how many cases we had to take home each visit so we didn't run out before the next trip.  I began to travel everywhere with the car half-filled with Dr Pepper and the rest with husband, self, a litte baggage and a few dogs. I actually flew to MA to attend a fellowship course at Tufts Vet Med School. Earlier ventures east of the Mississippi and north of<br />the Tennessee had blown it into my face that they didn't carry that pansy-assed tea party fare in those parts. A major fast food chain had never heard of it. But one of the doctors at Tufts actually drank DP! And he wouldn't share it at our box lunch socials.  I one-upped him with Dublin DP, and while I wouldn't share either, I sent him a case from Texas.  Next year, he came to a conference in Texas and looked for DDP everywhere. I finally told him the territorial secret and gave him Willie Kloster's Dublin factory address. I don't know if he could afford it on a vet/professor's salary (the shipping will kill you), but at least he had tasted Heaven.  I gave up alcohol, inherited a farm in DDP territory,and changed my life, dedicating myself to good deeds.  Is that a witness or not!  Truly, I love Dublin Dr Pepper, and met Willie Kloster on a plant tour, complete with a cold bottle of his brew from the machine (he put up the dimes).  On a side note, James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux likes Dr Pepper over crushed ice, but he doesn't have access to the good stuff.  You don't water it down. Maybe he would have stopped drinking sooner if Willie could have sold his product in LA.  Insert silly emoticon here. Dublin Dr Pepper has about a 1% share of Snapple Dr Pepper sales, but other distributors see Willie's original formula as a threat and are suing to restrict sales of Dublin Dr Pepper to the original 6 counties and to take Dublin out of the name.  Never happen.  It is the greatest stuff ever, and will persist in the environment as long as DDT, but it is better for you.

review/summary: Dublin's the Best Dr. Pepper
review/text: If you prefer Dr. Pepper, you need to try this cold and fresh at least once.  Drink one of these a day for six days and good luck going back to regular without missing it.<br /><br />Sure it is only 8 ounces and about $2 a bottle, including shipping.  Both aluminum and plastic affect taste.  Additionally, not even the beet sugar they had out compares to the cane sugar.  Real sugar soda is more satisfying, so you'll be full/satisfied faster.  IF you're satisfied from a 12 ounce serving, you'll be satisfied by this 8 ounce. I can't always afford Dublin, over regular, but I'd always take it over regular.  Given the smaller portion and higher price, this is definitely soda for once a day or less and savored, not chugged (which is the healthier way to consume soda, anyways).<br /><br />Admittedly, if this was cheaper/more available, I would probably drink two of these a day, no matter how bad it was for me and what caffeine withdrawal I would face without them.<br /><br />I've never gotten this from Amazon, but from local restaurant or Dublin's web site.<br /><br />Worst of all, Corporate Dr. Pepper has sued Dublin, which is outrageous.  Get this before corporate stupidity stops production of the best Dr. Pepper (and in my opinion soft drink) on the planet.  Seriously, if this stops being available, I'm going to ban corporate.<br /><br />My fave beverages are certain water, Dr. Pepper, Green Tea and Milk.  Certainly I enjoy other beverages.<br /><br />Those trying a real sugar soda, coming from high fructose corn syrup, should be aware that real sugar soda tastes a little sweeter.  Obviously, this product isn't ideal for those for who want quantity over quality, non glass containers, etc.  It is possible to get Dublin DP in cans, but that isn't the best way to taste test.

I immediately cut out all high fructose corn syrup, and suddenly no more symptoms, after six years, I was delighted!!!<br /><br />Well, my favorite drink is Dr. Pepper. I hate diet soda, and refuse to drink it, forget it. I gave up soda completely, and moved on with my life.<br /><br />On a recent trip to Colorado, an antiques shop had Dublin Dr. Pepper. I had no idea anyone still made Dr. Pepper with real cane sugar anymore, and I was ecstatic!!! I bought five bottles and hoarded them greedily! Of course, five bottles simply wasn't nearly enough, and now I find out Amazon carries this! I am so happy, of course the price is outrageous, but it is far better than not having any!

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 4:44 Mins<br /><br /></span>The soda is a nice dark caramel color. There is mild carbonation and a slight froth at the top. It smells like the characteristic Dr. Pepper smell, which is slightly fruity, spicy, and sweet. There is a faint minty undertone to it. It is made with Imperial Pure Cane Sugar instead of High Fructose Corn Syrup, and the sweetness of it is just perfect. It has a creamy consistency and is very very smooth to drink. It has the Dr. Pepper taste, yet unlike the canned version of the soda, it is not acidic or harsh in any way, and is not overpowered with carbonation of sweetness. The Dublin Dr. Pepper is very delicious. After drinking this, I am left wanting more!

review/summary: The current store bought Dr Pepper cannot compare!!!
review/text: For those not within driving distance to Dublin, Tx, you just need to cough up the higher cost plus shipping. In Dublin you can buy them for about $1 each. I grew up drinking the original Dr Pepper 45 years ago in the 10oz bottles.  In the mid 70's, my family's construction business built a new bottling plant in Irving, Tx. They still used the original receipe.  We have some cool commemoritive bottles.  When the US went nuts and started using high fructose syrup, all soft drinks became garbage.  I all but stopped drinking soft drinks. Then I rediscovered my coveted (Dublin) Dr Pepper at a local (Dallas) market. That was a one time only deal.  Now I have to drive to Dublin. Many stores now carry the new "pure cane sugar" from Dr Pepper but it is NOT the original recipe developed in Waco, Tx and is ONLY available now in Dublin, Texas. The difference in taste is stark even though both are using imperial pure cane sugar. The 8oz bottles are 100 calories and are the perfect size. I have no financial interest in Dublin Dr Pepper, they are simply the best Dr Pepper you will ever taste. Cheers!!

review/text: I got into salts, the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt,  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.  They seem so anyway.  Now the darker shades of salt do have different minerals, depending where they're from.  You need to be careful though , remember these gourmet salts do not have iodine, so make sure you continue to use table salt, though it is hard to do so.  Love this salt on salads and steak,  trust me.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.<br /><br />To me, "French gray" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table.

review/summary: Wholesome Goodness That My Pup Loves!
review/text: I know a lot about dogs. People consider me a future dog lady and I preach the words of Cesar Millan. My pup is the cutest 8 lb. Yorkie. Stella and Chewy's was recommended to me by an expensive pet store in NYC's West Village where my friend works. These treats are probably the closest things that your dog will get to a "wild" nutrition. The meat is freeze-dried so the texture is light and flaky. For those worried about parasites, there is a pathogen-free guarantee on the label. The package is SMALL. My pup flies through these things. His favorite is the duck flavor and he doesn't really like S&C's Kisses.

review/summary: Best Barbecue Chicken Glaze . The General Does It Right
review/text: I'm not the biggest chicken fan, but a friend of mine, Chef Mike,<br />of West Creek, NJ ...barbecued chicken for the first time ...<br />Matter-of-fact, he cremated it and was about to throw all 6lbs.<br />out ...  Luckily, I took a bite before it hit the garbage bin.<br /><br />And From this point, I was addicted. Chef Mike made all the mistakes<br />that day of a beginning barbecue novice. He didn't marinate the chicken,<br />just slapped it on the chicken and threw it on the grill (low settings).<br />He turned the chicken 4 times. The skin was blackened ... charred ...<br />but the taste, at least to me, was addicting, out of this world.<br /><br />He made the same chicken for my visit last week the exact same way<br />because I raved about his recipe (remember, I'm not a big chicken eater)<br /> .... Again ... Totally blackened on the outside, perfectly cooked inside.<br />NO raw,rubbery taste.<br /><br />I went to my mom's this weekend. We tried to replicate Chef Mike's chicken.<br />We used a generic ShopRite Barbecue sauce. No way. It wasn't the same. After<br />three pieces, I had had it (and so did everyone else).<br /><br />I guess this sauce, General Tso's, along with the blackened flavor is what gave<br />Mike's chicken that unique, addicting taste, one of a kind, taste sensation (I<br />ate 5 lbs of chicken myself, at one sitting).<br /><br />Give it a try ... and if you like the really like the flavor of<br />sizzling grilled chicken .. try a piece or two... and if you get hooked,<br />make sure you invite me over for your next grilling !

review/text: Honey sticks are average size, (what i wanted). Honey is sweet and mild but nothing like a clover honey. I'm a bit of a honey addict so to have an easier way to eat it other than dipping a spoon into a jar like Winnie the poo is great=] To open, grab edge of honey stick with thumb and pointer. Hold the honey stick so the edge is vertical and bite down the edge with your front teeth. I open them very easily with this technique. Some of my friends struggle opening them their first time. it's really easy though.

review/text: These Wildflower honey sticks are an extremely sweet, delicious delight for those who love honey. It's enough for a cup of tea for me, yet may not be for others. Each stick is approximately a teaspoon of honey. This is also a great snack for you kids because it's much healthier than the sugary, high fructose chemical junk in most snacks these days. LOVE that it's a 100 percent USA product as well and not made in CHINA. My only beef about AMAZON is price. Sometimes their prices are very reasonable. I just bought a few days ago for $10 and now see they are $12 for 50 sticks.

review/text: There is no caramel flavor here to be found, unless you add your own. The coffee itself is good but it is very disappointing if you are expecting it to taste like caramel. For people who dislike flavored coffee this might be a good choice (though why would those people be looking at this product I'm not sure...) The description has one thing right - "hint of caramel". With this subtle a hint, I don't think anyone would guess it was caramel flavored coffee without reading the label.

review/summary: Caramel Flavor So Mild, It Barely Exists...
review/text: I love a cup of Starbucks coffee, and I love a good flavored coffee.  When Starbucks announced Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I really looked forward to purchasing and tasting it.  Caramel-flavored coffee is one of my personal favorites - as long as it is not sickenly artificial, e.g. Ghirardelli Chocolate Caramel flavored coffee.  Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark.  The Caramel Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no caramel odor and has even less caramel taste.  Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging.  In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup.  This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the caramel flavor.  Because the coffee does have a mild caramel tone, it actually has a bit of a burnt taste.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Caramel Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew.  If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's and put the word "fusions" in the search box.  You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards.

review/summary: Strange Color, Smells Weird, Bad Aftertaste
review/text: To give a bit of credit the side of the bag explains that the coffee is a dark roast flavored with burnt sugar, licorice root, orange peel, cinnamon and nutmeg - not quite the delicious buttery caramel that they picture on the front. I feel it's deceiving though - the coffee looks unusually dark, has a strange chemical smell [perhaps from the licorice, but I love licorice and this smells like a solvent] and a noticeably bad aftertaste. Even with extra cream. For the eight bucks I paid in-store I'd rather have bought some Folgers and a bag of Werthers caramels to mix in - would have been a better value.

review/summary: Yay for quality
review/text: There is no Starbucks in my town, and this is the next best thing. It beats every other ground coffee on the shelf. Also, I save my empty bags so when I visit a town with a Starbucks, I can get a free cup of coffee! Rewarding responsibility is a great thing.

review/summary: i couldn't even have half a bag
review/text: this coffee has been extremely disappointing for me, i can't finish it it's so bad.<br />i am a HUGE starbucks fan and pay their premium for coffee because it's good but this is unacceptable.<br />the coffee has a burnt flavor, and not as in pike place roast burnt- BURNT, and the caramel flavor which is almost non-existent is disgusting.<br />if you like starbucks with caramel, get pike place roast, the christmas blend, or something else comparable and add torani or hershey caramel syrup.

review/summary: Amazing Coffee
review/text: I thoroughly enjoyed buying this coffee. I am a Starbucks coffee lover, and I had never seen this line before so I was curious. It was definitely a plus that I received the items before the initial shipped date! It was delivered fairly quickly as well! I would definitely buy this favor of coffee again, and the price was a steal!!!

review/summary: Wonderful Coffee Blend
review/text: This came in phenomenal time.  I was shocked at how fast it arrived.  The coffee itself does taste like caramel, but it's not too sweet nor does it have that strange aftertaste that some flavored coffees can have.  I would use this seller again in a heartbeat and look forward to trying more of their coffee.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I love flavored teas and don't like flavored coffee, mainly because the flavoring is too strong or as in some like the Door County brand, taste like chemicals.  Yuck.  This coffee is perfect, coffee taste with just a little caramel.  It is a little pricey, at least for me.

review/summary: Great taste!
review/text: I read the bad reviews on this coffee and am glad that I didn't let them dissuade me from buying this product.  I like the Natural Fusions vanilla coffee by Starbucks and this one is just as good.  It's a pleasing coffee with subtle caramel undertones.  I'll buy it again in the future if it's available.

review/summary: Horrible odor, Smells like no coffee I ever enjoyed.
review/text: I love coffee, and have a terrible addiction to Starbucks! So, when I was in the coffee aisle looking for a nice flavor to try I saw the Starbucks Caramel Natural Fusions. I was so excited to set up my coffee maker so that all I had to do was hit the switch in the morning! There is nothing I love more than the smell of fresh coffee when a new package is opened but when I opened up this coffee I almost gagged. The smell was overwhelming, sort of like burnt dirt. It was extremely dark in color too, almost like soil. I still have yet to hit the brew button on the coffee maker tomorrow morn, but I figure I would give it a fair shot. After reading some of the reviews here tonight, I am already expecting to be tossing it down the drain.

review/summary: Absolutely Disgusting!
review/text: My office of 4 women tried this coffee. Every single one of us thought it was disgusting. Some of us checked to see if the beans had mold on them because it tasted SO bad.  And the SMELL! We didn't notice it when we were making the coffee but if you take a little sniff from the bag, it almost makes you want to vomit. A couple of us decided that it smelled like a filthy behind/tush.  I seriously can't believe that any business, let alone Starbucks, would sell this!!! FOR GOODNESS SAKES DON'T BUY THIS! It's HORRIBLE.
