review/summary: It's indeed "bold" but good
review/text: Newman's K-cup coffee is indeed bold coffee which I like but it's best if you have cups that can accommodate the largest brewing setting on the Keurig machine. My wife thinks the coffee is too strong but I presume Newman's makes a milder form which I have not been able to find. I also like the idea that the Newman brand supports a charity.

review/summary: Really good cup of coffee
review/text: We are new to the Kuerig machine and love it.  Still trying the many different varieties of coffee available.  This one is a keeper for sure.  Newmans Own Special Blend is a great strong cup, even at the largest cup setting. (9.25 OZ on our B60 machine)<br />No bitter taste, no after taste I've detected.  Just a nice strong "wake-up call" for the morning.<br />I will always have some of this around.

review/summary: My Favorite Organic Dried Apple Chip
review/text: I have tried many dried apple chips including all the varieties carried by Bare Fruit including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017I753O">Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Cinnamon Apple Chips, 2.6 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017IAMU2">Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Granny Smith Apple Chips, 2.6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>, my favorite of these all are the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017I96LI">Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Fuji Apple Chips, 2.6 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>.  They have a delicious nutritious flavor and satisfy that I wanna-crunchy-chip craving and are great right out of the bag or as an accompaniment to a sandwich or entree or on top of yogurt/ice cream, etc - well i can't think of one thing that these fuji apple chips wouldn't taste great with combo!<br /><br />I ordered mine from Amazon and they arrived with 11 months to expiration - that means we need to eat one bag a little more frequently than once per month - no problem!  We signed up for subscribe-n-save as we can eat them faster than that!  I can't imagine who wouldn't love these!  They are available at my local Jimbo's for $2.59/bag so I appreciate saving money buying them in bulk from Amazon subscribe-n-save!

I was delighted to find them at a lower cost with free shipping through Amazon.com...what convenience.<br /><br />My younger son's comment was, "Mom, these are friggin delicious!" They hike, bike and camp. His wife is in medical school, studying long hours. What could be an easier snack? Each bag has the equilivent of 5 organic apples. They're crisp and sweet, with 29 calories per serving.<br /><br />These are a hit with our family. We'll be ordering more.

review/summary: Best dried fruit out there in my book!
review/text: I've tried all the dried fruit brands and this is by far my favorite.<br /><br />The apples are thinly sliced and crispy.  There is no fake flavoring or junk added to these apple chips.  The coloring is natural and not processed, meaning that some of the chips are darker than others and flawed, yet they all taste consistent.  They actually taste like real apples.<br /><br />It says on the bag that there are five apples inside, which I believe.  If I eat half a bag, I feel fine, but if I eat the entire thing I get a stomach ache from too much.  I know - only eat half a bag!<br /><br />Stays fresh after opening for a few days without any issues.  LOVE these!

They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. There are 6 servings in every 2.6 ounce bag, with 29 calories in each serving. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Low calorie snacks, while good for you.
review/text: They are a good snack to have on hand when you get that sudden craving to eat on finger foods.<br />Like potato chips, but much healthier and low in fat.<br />There are no added sugar, just the dried fuji apples.<br /><br />The apples are sweet, though it does vary with each apple.<br />A little expensive, but I don't mind it.  A dozen lasts me for a little while :)<br />Long shelf life.<br />The only complaint I would have is that they only give half a bag of the apples, fill the rest with air.<br />But then again, most chips bags are like that.

review/summary: Stale Perhaps?
review/text: I bought a few bags of these at my local store. My bag was full of delicious tasting, crunchy, crisp textured apple pieces. I was in heaven. I have teeth issues, and so a lot of raw foods are difficult for me to eat and so this seemed like a wonderful alternative. I immediately hopped on Amazon to purchase the 12 pack. These, however must not be the "fresh" ones. Every bag I have opened, the chips are what I would consider stale. They aren't crips, they aren't even really chewy in the conventional dried apple sense. They are difficult to chew. The taste is the same, but it's a struggle to eat. Even my husband, whos teeth do not have issues are disappointed in the change. I don't know what it is, but I won't be buying again. I will just have to stick to paying way too much in the store.

I love the crisp of the chips, They are 100% organic & gluten-free.<br /><br />They say there are 5 apples in a bag but it doesn't feel that way & sometimes you end up getting the core of the apple (extra chewy, not a fan).<br /><br />But with that said, you should know that my coworkers and I order in bulk (up to 4 packs of 12 in one order) because it's so popular here!

review/summary: Dried Organic Apple "Crumbs"
review/text: I've opened three of the bags so far - these are tiny dried bits / crumbs of brown color dried apple.  The taste is alright - not as good as some of the other brands purchased locally.  They certainly didn't look anything like the photo on the bag (that is a photo - not a clear window).  Would not order again.  I will donate balance of bags to local food bank - hopefully someone will enjoy these more than I did.

Good taste and you can drink hot or cold but make sure you use at least 3 heaping tsp for a small mug and up to 6 for a large mug. For diversity add flavored creamers or ice cream.  Less expensive than most of the cold coffees out there and better.<br />My only negative is that I don't understand why its so much more expensive than the Amaretto or Peppermint Mocha and why its not on the same shipping schedule as they are.

There is no doubt about having a perfect cup of Cappucino right from your own kitchen. Here is  where my biggest concern is. I'm a runner and I know what foods/drinks enhance my running and what worsen it. In comparison, drinking this before a run causes my breathing harder than coffee with milk/cream. I feel very asthmatic. For athletes, this is a no-no, do not touch drink. The other thing that's just as bad for runners...carbonated beverages.<br /><br />I'm really curious to what the "real" ingredients are in this product.

It makes the best breakfast drink and I drink it in the afternoons for "high tea"!<br />My store was ALWAYS out of  stock on the Mocha Cappuccino and it seems that would tell them they needed to stock it in larger quantities----DUH!<br />So I decided to go online and search for it.  Amazon came up right away and I have been very excited to get it!<br />I placed my order this evening and can't wait for it to arrive!<br />THANKS AMAZON!

review/summary: Awesome product -- now it's easy to add quinoa to your diet
review/text: Each of the containers has a large serving of quinoa (but only 170 calories) that is already perfectly cooked. I am not much of a cook myself and cooking dry quinoa, particularly just a single serving, didn't work for me.  Since it is already perfectly cooked, but totally plain, I can use it as a really quick and healthier base for many things where white rice or brown rice would work.  It can also be stirred into any strongly flavored sauced dish that needs a little toning down or extra hardiness or texture.  I use it most often as a nice substitute for rice in what used to be a "rice bowl" with meat and other ingredients on top.  I have now bought this item 3 times.  As far as I have found, this is a completely unique product and no one else makes anything as flexible and convenient with quinoa.

review/summary: Great product for busy people
review/text: Quinoa is a relatively new grain to the North American market, but it's an ancient staple in South America.  And I'm really glad it's finally gotten popular, because it is an INCREDIBLE source of vegetable protein -- there are six grams of protein in each of these meal-size servings.  It has a mild taste, just as rice does.  It's a natural grain, and can be the equivalent of rice or potatoes in a traditional meal.  But, there's so much more you can do with it!  I've scrambled it into eggs, to provide more protein and volume.  I've added it to soups, I've just heated it, thrown in blueberries, and had it with a little hazelnut milk as a breakfast cereal.  I've had it warmed for lunch with a little salsa and avocado on it.  I've added it to recipes for breads, muffins, health bars.  I've used it to thicken casseroles, it's just a great, all-purpose pantry item.  And, it's organic, and fully prepared.  I like to mix a pack of this quinoa, with a pack of the McDougall's Lentil Curry that Amazon also carries -- and then I spoon that mix into romaine lettuce leaves, with a dollop of salsa, to make great tasting lettuce wraps for a fun frisky lunch.  This ready-to-serve organic quinoa gets five stars and two thumbs up from me.

review/text: This brand of quinoa tasted very green/unripened.  I added chicken and mixed veggies and a partial packet of condensed chicken stock but the taste of the quinoa was too strong.  I've had quinoa lots of times but it never tasted like this.  It might work okay if you dumped it in a big pot of home made soup but I'd be concerned of ruining it.  I won't be buying it again and I'm not really sure what to do with the rest of the shipment.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: I tried this despite the mixed reviews and am glad I did.  I question whether the critical reviews are of quinoa, often an acquired taste, rather than this product.  I like quinoa and use it in place of rice for its nutritional value, and this product is well-prepared quinoa.  It does not have the soapy flavor of the inadequately pre-rinsed  grain, and it's thoroughly cooked but not mushy.  I've had two containers of it now, and took a big bite of it alone from the first to evaluate the flavor and was happy with it.<br />The packaging is handy for a healthy portable lunch - one of these with a packet of prepared beans is quick and convenient.

review/text: I recently started eating Quinoa and I must that I was excited to see these ready made packages. Yes Quinoa is easy to make but they are great for the office or on the go.<br /><br />I will agree that this Quinoa is not full of flavor, but im a little confused as to what quinoa these other reviewers are making that is so tasty. Its my experience that pretty much ALL quinoa is bland in its natural state. The idea is to mix things into to spice it up. That being said, I find this quinoa to be very good. I have been adding a can of tuna or boneless sardines to it, some avacado and some lemmon juice to moisten it up and wow what a great lunch.<br /><br />Now im sure you can make better quinoa at home, especially if you toast it and cook it with chicken stock, but for what this is, its great. I will be buying more.

review/summary: Very flavorful Salsa, nice Jalapeno flavor and kick to it
review/text: This salsa is very green (unlike the picture) and has a great flavor along with a powerful kick to it.  Frankly it's become something we really enjoy in our home.  It's got just the right balance of flavor and kick.  Some salsas focus too much on the kick and they forget about the flavor!  This has a really nice flavor and still has enough kick that you know you're eating a nice hot salsa.<br /><br />If you can find this locally, it's a much better deal, under five bucks a bottle when you can find it.  Online I'm not sure why they have such a premium price.  I actually track which stores in my area stock this (none very close to me) so I buy several bottles at a time when I'm near the stores that have it.<br /><br />4 stars, the salsa is actually 5 but the price and shipping they charge here lower it down a notch.

I don't know how they do it, but the flakes are super light and crispy with whole-grain heartiness and a sweetness that tastes so naturally pleasant!  Plus, if you leave it in milk or water for a while (or even put it in the microwave for a bit), you can recreate the most scrumptious version of "oatmeal" I've ever had!  Plus it's great for topping with fruit or nuts.  GREAT cereal!

review/text: I first saw these at a cousins house and was just amazed.  They are the best for roasting and making GIANT s'mores.  When I got back home I could not find them in stores and ended up purchasing them here.  They shipped fine and arrived looking tasty. Highly recommend to impress your friends.

review/summary: Giant Marshmallows...Giant Fun!!!
review/text: My children first experienced these marshmallows at a friend's home over the summer and could not stop talking about them. We searched everywhere for months to purchase them for S'mores with no luck. Amazon is always my first internet stop when I can't find something locally, and again hasn't failed me. When we opened the box, the entire kitchen was filled with the sweet scent of the puffy gems. The kids couldnt wait to get their hands on them and promised to consume the entire bag the night we roasted them. They fell a little short....after eating the first one they leisurely positioned a second on the sticks and took their time transforming the silky beauties into crunches caramel nuggets...half way through this round I started hearing mumbles and murmurs of stomachaches...half of the second marshmallows turned into a fire-show because I wouldn't let them feed them to the dogs. Even I couldn't eat them BUT I WANTED TO. However, one giant marshmallow must be the equivalent of at least five regular sized marshmallows and I am ashamed to say that I ate both of mine. They have a good, mild vanilla flavor, more delicate than Kraft. They are fluffier than the other brands as well. The most surprising thing to me is that THERE IS NO ARTIFICIAL BLUE COLORANT ADDED TO THIS PRODUCT!!!! ABSOLUTELY YUMMY AND FUN!!!!

review/text: These giant marshmallows are show stoppers! If you like to roast your marshmallow and eat the outside off, you can do that like 3 times with these bad boys. They are soo big you can just keep goin! I love em! I get to have a nice big bite of marshmallow, instead of a petite little nibble from the normal sized ones.

review/text: I gave this whitefish roe 4 stars because of the great quality of the product and the free next day shipping.  It arrived a day early and ice cold.  HOWEVER, I don't like this roe.  Nothing against the company or the actual roe -- it's just my preference.  It doesn't give that "pop" in the mouth that I love with caviar.  What a shame because it tastes great - mild and not too salty at all -- but the mouth-feel and texture are a turn-off.  For $27 dollars and free prime shipping, it was worth the try but it really feels like I'm trying to chew tiny glass beads.  At least my cat loves it so it isn't a total waste.

He calls it "smokey tea" instead of it's real name.<br />It's one of those things that you either will love it or hate it, there's no in between.  If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of "softens" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!

review/text: This is my first bag of chai tea and I have to say, it's extremely strong if you try to drink this straight. I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.

review/summary: Bitter Grass Clippings
review/text: I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea "leaves" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/summary: Daughter's first choice
review/text: My adult daughter is "into" saving the planet, tigers, water resources, trees, etc. She chose this chai tea after discovering an old tea infuser in the kitchen drawer thinking it would be grand to make tea "the old fashioned way".  She realized with the first brewed cup that loose tea has a much fresher, intense flavor than teas in a bag. I doubt that she will go back to using tea bags again and will probably research and request more Stash tea products in the future.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a "premium" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.

review/text: Having purchased a package of this tea and one of Stash's Pinhead Gunpowder Green, I can safely say that the Gunpowder is much better tea. The "Organic Premium" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better.

review/summary: Very Bergamot-y Tea!
review/text: ****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: "Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it."<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****

I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.

It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.

review/text: ****<br />This is a good, albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash. It is made from blended black teas. I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****

review/text: i was a die hard Teavana fan until they discontinued (retired) several of my favorite teas<br />including Assam Gold Rain FTGFOP though i had some left i decided to give this a try and was<br />pleasantly surprised, it is full bodied w slight astringent qualities balanced by sweet notes at<br />the start w a nice malty finish.<br />i drink it straight up w raw sugar &/ or raw honey.<br />it is about the same price as Teavana's Assam was (if you buy it on Amazon) i will be buying more soon<br />my friends and family love it also by the way.
