review/summary: Superb Dark Roast
review/text: On their web site, Coffee Bean Direct advertises this as their darkest roast. Previously, on Amazon, I reviewed Coffee Bean Direct's Italian Espresso Roast and find the Super Dark Espresso to be equally good and only slightly different. For my basic observations see the previous review; this review will serve to give the reader my observations made in a side-by-side comparison.<br /><br />I have uploaded an image of the two roasts, the Italian Espresso on the left, the Super Dark Espresso on the right. Both are, clearly, Espresso roasts as evidenced by the surface oil on the beans. Both roasts are slightly unevenly roasted, the Italian Espresso more so than the Super Dark. Not clearly shown in the image is the fact that a small percentage of the beans of the Super Dark roast are starting to break apart, a consequence of exceeding the usual roasting temperatures of the so-called "second crack." So what? It indicates to me that the Super Dark roast beans have been roasted to a point beyond which further roasting would not be possible without destroying the beans (yielding a charcoal-like product). However, as noted, the added roasting has produced a more even dark roast which, in turn, has produced a coffee that is slightly more rich than the Italian Espresso roast. Here I would emphasize the word "slightly"; apart from a side-by-side sampling, I doubt I could distinguish one from the other on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br />In a word, both roasts are superb and nicely priced. If I recall correctly, the Super Dark roast cost $3.00 more than the Italian Espresso roast, I should think a reasonable difference if one's palate is able to differentiate between the two roasts.<br /><br />In either case, I think anyone who enjoys dark roast coffees or Espresso will be happy with either of these blends.

review/summary: Great Roast but Bad Beans
review/text: One of the methods used to judge the quality of beans is by size (with some exceptions, like peaberry). Another way to evaluate beans is by consistency of size. The best beans should be large and all of the same size.<br /><br />The beans used in this super dark roast are, for the most part, very small and are of varying sizes. I put them beside the the French Roast Papua New Guinea I bought before this bag and there's a quite noticeable difference. The New Guinea beans are larger and far more uniform. Look in the picture the other user posted and you can see the tiny beans in there.<br /><br />So, there's a super dark roast, nice and oily and luscious looking, on some bad beans. The result: Meh.<br /><br />This coffee is "Meh". there's nothing bad about it, but there's also nothing at all exciting or interesting about it. The roast is very dark but this isn't a very robust cup of coffee (I made mine using a drip maker). It's also possible my bag had been sitting around for a while, no way to know. I won't be ordering this one again.

review/summary: Good alternative to more expensive expresso
review/text: We typically use Black Cat but decided to find an everyday, more affordable alternative.  This bean is roasted close to delivery and oily enough to produce a decent crema.  The flavor is more acidic, thus handles milk well without diluting taste.  Certainly there are better beans out there but these cannot be excluded from consideration.

review/summary: My favorite of the Envirokidz lineup by a mile!
review/text: I am an adult who has to follow a gluten free diet.  I check out the Envirokids brand(as well as any other gluten free cereal)if I ever see them on sale.  I just decided to pick up a box of Koala Crisp today and I must say this is my favorite flavor and style that they have to offer.  I find the other 2 that I have tried(panda puffs, gorilla munch)to be decent but i couldn't quite get into the texture of them.  The coala crisp soaks perfectly into the milk and has just enough crunch to go along with that sweet cocoa flavor to satisfy my cravings.  I personally only eat cereal on the occasion as it doesn't fill me up all that well(not to mention I keep wanting to have another bowl, and another), but these are perfect for the occasional treat. Congratulations envirokidz, a 24 year old has bestowed upon you 5 stars.

review/summary: Excellent price, excellent packaging and excellent product!
review/text: I was sold on this cereal a while back. My child has celiac and the Envirokidz lineup is a lifesaver for us. This cereal has all the qualifications I look for in his processed foods - gluten free certified, Organic certified, Made in the USA,  non GMO, no preservatives, no food colorings and no irradiation.<br /><br />Packaging was my main concern when trying out the enviropakz. I've bought this cereal often in the boxes and the air filled into the inner plastic bag seems to be what keeps the cereal from crumbling. My concern was that shipping in a plastic bag alone would cause a lot of the cereal to get crushed. This was NOT the case. The 3 bags were shipped inside an amazon box that was almost exactly the right size so that there ws no shifting of the product inside. The enviropakz themselves are not filled with air but filled sufficiently so that the cereal does not shift around inside the bag.<br /><br />Bottom line - excellent product for the environmentally concious, GF consumer!

review/summary: Previously reviewed in smaller package - this is even better!
review/text: I've been eating this cereal for several years now, and really like it.  I previously reviewed it, but Amazon is giving me another chance to review it - presumably because I'm now getting it in the much larger packaging.  So here goes:<br /><br />1.  It beats the price of a good, organic, gluten-free cereal in the local grocery store or health food store hands down, particularly in the large 26-ounce bag (package of three) - price it out on a per-ounce basis and it's far better.  Sometimes this organic, gluten free cereal in this packaging is LESS expensive than typical grocery store shelf offerings.  The fact that a well known national brand crispy rice cereal has recently gone gluten free doesn't matter as far as I'm concerned.  Koala Crisp adds organic to its strong points, and it's STILL less expensive than the new gluten free national brand.<br /><br />2.  I like the taste and texture.  These are NOT 90% air like certain crispy rice cereals made by a big-name national brand.  If you like "soggy," fine - just let it soak a few extra minutes before eating.  It's good either way.<br /><br />3.  In my other review of this product, one person that commented tried to take issue with the nutritional content of the product.  My response to that was to simply compare the nutritional label of this product with the nutritional label of unprocessed whole grain brown rice.  One would have to say that whole grain brown rice was unhealthy in order to objectively say this product is also not healthy.<br /><br />Back to the packaging - presumably the reason Amazon gave me another opportunity to review it.  When Nature's Path (the company making this and other great gluten free cereals) came out with the "Enviropackz" for many of their cereals, that dropped the price, and everybody won.  I think the manufacturer is to be commended for doing so.<br /><br />In short, great cereal, not just for kids.  I eat it very frequently and have no plans to stop eating it.  My suggestion: go to a local health food store (or section of a large grocery chain) and try to get just one box to try it out.  If you like it, I highly recommend the "subscription" program.  You can save an additional 15% with your very first order, and you choose the quantity and the frequency for delivery.  What's not to like?!?

review/text: This was good coffee at a very good price. I was hoping "Dark Roast Espresso" meant "espresso roast", but it's merely finely ground. Taste-wise, it seems more of a medium-dark than a dark roast. It's tasty, but lacks the citrus-like tang I prefer, though this might be best for most American coffee drinkers.<br /><br />Overall, this was a better than adequate coffee for an excellent price. If you're reading this, chances are you'll like the coffee. For those like myself that generally feel that the darker the roast, the better, it's still worth a buy for the cost, but don't get your hopes up for the wording on the package.

Make no mistake, you are not going to get a full pound of high-quality matcha for less than several hundred dollars.<br />This is not matcha for drinking; it is matcha for cooking, baking, and even adventurously powdering breakfast cereal and ice cream with. If you want the stuff used in a Japanese tea ceremony, plan to pay a minimum of a dollar a gram, but if you want a lot of decent matcha for other purposes at a good price, this is it.

review/summary: Culinary teas bulk matcha vs. "tea ceremony quality" matcha
review/text: I am new to matcha drinking, so was somewhat concerned re: customer comments Culinary Teas matcha being "brown" (i.e. a not the correct bright green color). I had only tried Starbucks Matcha (PLEASE BE ADVISED - it is very tasty, but probably because the number one ingredient on the label is sugar). Also, a pound of Starbucks Matcha (as sold on a popular auction site) costs about the same as a pound of Culinary Teas bulk Matcha)...so you are getting far less of the expensive and healthful green tea powder and more sugar (the Starbucks product is somehow micronized so it does mix into solution much easier than a less processed pure tea powder). The teaspoon on the right is Teavana (at $16 for 30 grams - thats 2 Tbsp) they said it was the highest "tea ceremony" quality matcha. The teaspoon on the left is the bulk (1 lb, silver bag) CT product. Photo taken without a flash and not retouched so actual colors show. CT matcha  is slightly less brilliant green. I mixed exact quantities (1/2 tsp) of matcha in 8 oz of liquid with exact quantities of sweetener (a blend of xylitol and stevia that I am experimenting with). The CT matcha tastes slightly less "green" and slightly more bitter than the Teavana, but I did the math ( a pound of CT would cost $240 at the Teavana $16 per 30 g cost) - so I am very happy with my CT purchase. Will use the smaller container for my "working" supply, freeze the rest and use as needed. Am finding Matcha to be a great substitute for my "too much coffee" habit and prefer the less instantaneous (but prolonged) energy boost it gives - not too mention alkalizing instead of acidifying, ECGC, and possible metabolism boosting effect.<br />PS Most Starbucks barristas do not know the Matcha powder contains sugar, so they will tell you the are not adding any. As consumers, we need to ask companies to STOP ADDING SUGAR (in whatever processed form it takes) to everything they make.

review/text: It tastes good enough and is affordable enough to use every day. It's not sweet and super bright, almost-neon green like medium and high grade matcha, but it's not bitter, unpleasant, stale, and brownish like Malden's similarly priced matcha. It is only slightly more expensive than Malden's matcha ($3.40/oz. or $2.62/oz. in bulk vs. Malden's $2.50/oz) but the quality is superior. I highly recommend this as an overall good mathca at a really good price.<br /><br />If this is the first matcha you try you won't be disappointed. But if you're not impressed with the taste keep in mind that the next step up in quality available through Amazon is at around $10/oz (ex. DoMatcha's 2nd Harvest).

review/text: At first glance it may seem that this product is somewhat expensive--$30+ for tea, right? But a pound of green tea powder is A LOT!!! For a 6 oz cup of tea or most other uses you only need to use about a half a teaspoon or things get a little strong and murky. But I add it to everything--my morning protein shake, yogurt, Gatorade for the gym, etc., etc. and still I have yet to make a dent in the bag. I have also looked at green tea powder at places like Whole Foods and Asian super markets, and this is a really good deal in comparison. So buy some and enjoy!

review/summary: You get what you pay for - Quality worth every penny spent
review/text: This product is everything you would expect, and then some. The shipping was fast. The Matcha is sent in a resealable, heavy-duty FOILED plastic bag, EXCELLENT quality. I recommend using a small tin for everyday use, taking no more than an ounce or two from the larger bag, to preserve the flavor and freshness.<br /><br />The taste is WONDERFUL. Very fresh, very green, very subtle, yet intense.<br />I purchased this product after Starbucks raised their prices (again!), because I had become a frozen green tea frappucino addict...Now I am just a Matcha addict.<br /><br />I love it in the evening warm, in a large mug with a good splash of milk, and simply adore it from the blender with milk, ice cubes, some vanilla syrup and a splash of whipping cream for the frothy, creamy taste...<br /><br />I use 2 level teaspoons, not packed, to a 20 oz. mug, so figure 1 teaspoon per "regular" coffee cup.<br /><br />The illustrative picture is what your matcha will look like. None of the other vendors show the color/quality of their product...For something like this, being able to see what you will get is half the issue. I can tell you that the flavor, which is the other half, is also the quality you would expect and wish for.

review/summary: Good but not quite starbucks
review/text: I bought this item based on the good reviews it got and for the price. I think this is a product that is more useful in baking than a hot tea - it seems to require a lot of careful mixing that is too much hassle for a quick cuppa. It was green and not brown like one of the reviews here stated. I just bought an ice cream maker and am planning to use it for that or just to add to my morning smoothie for a boost. I recently got a bag of the Starbucks version that is mixed with sugar and it blends very easily with hot water. They don't sell it in their stores in powder form like you can buy coffee, but I know enough people in the Starbucks biz to get it on a regular basis. I think I will stick with that version for a hot tea, but I think this 1lb bag is good value for my baking purposes. Hopefully the ice cream will be as good as I want it to be!

If you looking for top shelf, well then pay the high prices and get the best you can afford.  If you want second best I recommend DoMatcha's 2nd Harvest.  If you want cooking, smoothie or food grade matcha at an affordable price, ten this is the stuff. It is not brown. It is green.  Bright green no, but green.  Considering the price, the quick delivery and if you want to be able to afford to drink this at least twice a day, this is perfect.  No complaints.

review/summary: Great Product!!!!!!
review/text: Matcha green really works! I am so glad I decided to give it a chance. I am quite a skeptic about trying new products. It does exactly what I have been researching. It gives me energy and controls my appetite. I also tried it as a facial mask. It left my skin with a nice and beautiful glow. I have recommended this product to my mother-in-law, great aunt, my dad and my husband. A week ago my husband drank his first cup of matcha green tea. I came home from work, he had dinner cooked, and he cleaned the house. I will always have matcha green tea in my house with a 180 like this one. I am very, very pleased and satisfied with my purchase.

review/summary: Quite pleased with the transaction and the product
review/text: Fast shipping, quality product in durable bag with ziplock. Good quantity and cheap. Good taste. The only drawbacks is that product is really difficult to dissolve. I like to make mine with vanilla soy milk, but I always have to stir out the powder in a small quantity of boiling water before adding the soy milk and then microwaving or steeming it. It still does not dissolve completely. Also this is a problem because green tea should be made with water that is about 60 degrees to preserve the best taste...  I would like for the color to be more like the color in the photo, but it is a much more muddy green color. Not like starbucks...but maybe that means it is more natural - I dunno.

review/text: I just got into drinking Matcha and have been fascinated by it. This is an excellant product for a reasonable price. I have been drinking it once a day and this quantity of a half pound will last 3-4 months. Not bad for $16. I greatly enjoy the calmness of mind and energy it gives me. I like to add a little honey to it. For a good read on its health benefits check out the amnio acid that is in it called L-theanine.

review/summary: better than expected
review/text: I purchased some macha at a health food store and figured it was the best quality. I was assuming that with the bright color and smell it was the best. It was good-----but this macha tea is BETTER in my opinion. The color is darker-but the smell is stronger--which told me this was going to be more potent than what I had tried before. So far it gives me a great boost and my body likes it as well. ---I'm highly sensative to what I put into my body and I was happy to feel I made a great choice with this company and product. ****I plan to buy more in the future------

review/summary: Absolutely delicious! Great quality matcha.
review/text: Firstly, I received my matcha a day earlier than Amazon expected, which was awesome, I was so anxious to get it. The matcha came in neatly packaged with a note from the company who makes it.<br />Secondly, the first thing I did was to make a cold cinnamon matcha smoothie with 2% milk. It was delicious! The matcha is a deep green color and had a very fine grain, there was hardly a difference between this and ridiculously expensive "ceremonial grade" matcha. This matcha, as long as it is properly sifted and mixed properly, will make beautiful drinks.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering more of this when I run out but that won't be for a while- I ordered the 8oz bag. :)<br /><br />I can't wait to make matcha sugar cookies, and mocha cupcakes with matcha frosting. So many delicious possibilities!

review/summary: Solid Product, Fast shipping
review/text: The matcha green tea powder had a great color too it. The packaging was in a large, sealed reflective foil bag with a label showing the manufacture's nutrition information. (Note: The bag was not resealable, so make sure you have a container to store it in after opening.)<br /><br />The tea itself was a nice green color, very close to what is pictured in the description. I did not find it having a brownish tint at all, unlike some of the reviews that I have seen on here. It was all green. I could not find a better price for 8 oz. of matcha tea powder.<br /><br />I personally started drinking matcha tea recently so I cannot determine how much better or worse it is compared to other brands. I do, however, have to say that I love the taste of this tea. I drink it unsweetened as both hot and iced tea. I also have successfully replicated great smoothie recipes and  an iced latte recipe from my favorite beverage establishments (this stuff has saved me so much $$$ in smoothies that it has already paid for itself.)<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product. I was even more impressed with how fast it arrived. I was expecting 7-10 business days for it to be shipped and arrive, but it was at my doorstep in 3 business days!

review/summary: Strong but deelish!
review/text: By looking for an affordable substitute to the big coffee chains, I found this. It's excellent and more healthy because it is not full of sugar like other powders. At first I kept making it WAAAAY too strong because I've tried many other types of powder that required 2-3 tbsp per cup. This powder is pure green tea and a little goes a long way. Because a little goes a long way, it is definitely worth paying a little more $$ for this product...the other ones might be cheaper but you need a lot more in your cup to make a good quality green tea latte.

review/summary: extreme mediocritiy
review/text: The Matcha came promptly.  There is plenty of it.  Those are the positives.<br />The color of the Matcha looks nothing like the photo.  It is a deeper,  darker more muted green.  It tastes similar to what it looks-muddy,  sort of like dirty,  grassy, water.<br />I have purchased much higher quality Matcha at very reasonable prices ($18.00 for 8oz.) in Japanese markets in NYC and L.A.  I purchased this to drink every morning and to use in cooking and frappuccinos.  So far,  it is best for frappuccinos where the flavor is enhanced with plenty of sugar and Mimic Cream (almond, cashew cream substitute).<br />I would not recommend this product.  Either spend more or keep looking.  Good luck!

review/summary: Ok Matcha for the price
review/text: Tried matcha green tea powder for the first time and this one is actually not too bad.  It doesn't taste muddy and I taste the matcha green tea flavor.  So far, I've only tried this with hot water and as an ice tea. I will try it in smoothies next week.  Satisfied with the product and price but the only drawback is the packaging.  I cut a slit on the side and fold it after using, but a lot of the powder came out! So I had to pour it all in a tuber ware. You gotta change the packaging to a zip lock bag or something.  I wanted to order more but in the 16 oz, but the only thing stopping me is that there is a shipping fee AND it's sold by another company, why is that??

review/text: Bought to use in a cheesecake recipe that we've been enjoying for a year now using instant powder subsitutes...this is a reasonably-priced nice-sized sample to use. $5 shipping is a bit goofy for a soft 1-oz. packet of powder, but luckily I had a gift certificate. I look forward to trying different recipes with this. Cheesecake tastes good, a lot earthier/more organic now that we have the real matcha. I think I'll try making iced lattes now. Too bad it didn't come in the cute little round tin that they show it in...that was an appealing package but the resealable soft packet is nice too.

review/text: Have been using sea salt for years, but never have had the enjoyment of such a low-sodium alternative like Nutra-Salt.  It is a total "foodie" product, with all the benefits of approx. 66% lower sodium compared to regular salt.<br /><br />But the "enhancement" of food needing salt, is just joyous.<br /><br />PROBLEM:  The company cannot deliver in a timely manner.  And they don't answer phone or email inquiries on orders.  VERY frustrating.  Expect to wait a VERY LONG TIME for any order.  Shame on them!!  They are more focused on direct-retail, so if you can purchase it at a health food or retail market, do so.  Ordering on Amazon is a nightmare!!!!<br /><br />BC

review/text: I am solely interested in the health aspects, and sodium is of paramount concern.  Therefore, I am thrilled with the fact that this product actually has 66% less sodium, and a satisfactory flavor. Warning, be sure not to use too much - only a little is needed or your recipe will be too salty.  I do wish the holes in the shaker top were smaller, and for that reason, if making a small amount of something I oftentimes will put a tiny bit in my palm first and add pinches as needed, tasting as I go.  By the way, NutraSalt's seasoned salt and other savory blends are also very good..... I use them a lot.

review/summary: NutraSalt Low Sodium Seat Salt
review/text: i love this low sodium sea salt.  It makes it easy to keep our sodium consumption very low. Both my husband and I have to watch our sodium intake but it is so difficult to find products on the super market shelves that are truly low sodium.  Many that state low sodium on the label are still too high (ie; low sodium canned chicken broth is still 570mg per cup - yikes, versus reg. chicken broth at 970mg per cup). NutraSalt has 66% less sodium than regular sea salt.  Wow! We cook every day and eat out about once or twice a month.  This helps us stay healthier as restaurant fare is notoriously high in fat and sodium. The flavor of NutraSalt is not as strong as regular salt, therefore, be careful not to overdo it. I've never seen this product in any store so it's great to be able to buy it from Amazon.

review/summary: Amazing flavor in a small form!
review/text: These oils may come in a small bottle; however, they go a long way!  I first started to purchase the Garlic Oil from Costo about a year ago.  I was very disappointed to find that my local warehouse had discontinued the product, leaving me with only a few drops in my bottle.  I was thrilled to find this on Amazon and have since ordered several times.  This set makes a perfect gift or stocking stuffer for the holidays.  The 3 pack deal makes it an even better offer. After giving 6 sets this holiday season I have heard nothing but wonderful reviews.<br /><br />One of my favorite ways to use the garlic oil is for garlic bread. Take a loaf of Italian bread and slice about 1" thick.  Brush both side with the oil and sprinkle with a small amount of sea salt.  I cook the bread on the grill right before taking steaks off - about 2 minutes per side.<br /><br />All of the other oils are just a great and work very well in marinades and stir-fries.  You can really use them for just about anything - including dipping oils.  I will be back to purchase these time and time again.
