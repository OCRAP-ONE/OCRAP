review/summary: Sulfite-free makes a huge difference
review/text: Before buying these tomatoes, I bought a bulk order of some other sun-dried tomatoes that had been treated with sulfite.  They stunk up my entire kitchen for weeks, until I finally threw them out without finishing them.  In contrast, these sulfite-free tomatoes smell and taste like nothing but tomato.  I am giving them four stars instead of five because they are so expensive-- I suppose all sun-dried tomatoes are expensive, but I hold out hope they will come down in price.

review/text: I entered search for Kosher marshmallows and I got excited that an old campfire brand was now kosher. Hmmmm. Not. Why put it up with the real kosher or halal ones? Sorry to say to the Muslim manufacturers, halal marshmallows are NOT what American Muslims think of. Same for the pink or square chewy kosher brands. When you have a childhood memory, and then you clear pigs from your diet, this is not going to make it.

I typically just make a 6oz cup each time, not too much, but just enough to savor. Godiva's Caramel Hot Cocoa is even better but I haven't been able to find it anywhere even online or Godiva shops.<br /><br />As a stand alone hot chocolate, it's good enough. Everyone's taste buds are different so you really have to try it to know whether you like it or not.

Just mix one tea spoon of coffee with boiled water and it is ready. No suspended particles at all. If you add milk and sugar make sure you add the milk first and mix it and only then add the sugar. If you add them the other way around you will get particles of coffee suspended. No coffee machine, no filters, and fast preparation. EXCELLENT PRODUCT.

Just gives the Co. address in NJ. They are no better than any you can buy at your grocery store. No comparison to Mangia or DeCecco, both products of Italy...and not nearly as good as Racconto or Muir Glen, products of U.S., either. I won't buy them again. I could have just gotten a bad crop or something, but these are not good at all in comparison to the other Italian tomatoes I mentioned above. Not close.

review/summary: great chocolates, but...
review/text: the variety is very poor.  I've bought a few bag of these chocolates at the grocery store and the good news is that they're GREAT.  I wouldn't know they're sugar-free by the taste, they're divine.  The bad news is that one bag had dark chocolate candies, and caramel filled candies and only maybe one raspberry filled chocolate.  The next bag had the chocolates and the raspberries, but none of the caramel filled.  So if you're not worried about how many of each kind you'll get, these are great, but if you don't like the plain dark-chocolate candies, you might feel a bit ripped-off.

review/text: Got these on a whim hoping to find a lower fat alternative to the regular brand of salt & vinegar kettle chips I buy.  The brand that arrived was Michael Season's (not Herr's as shown) & they were very bland & a little bitter tasting.  If you did a blindfold taste-test on these, you would not be able to tell they have vinegar.  They are 40% less fat though, so a better alternative for lunches.  Price was okay, but going forward I will stick to buying the variety boxes of Mrs. Vickie's kettle chips at Sam's.

review/text: Caribou Coffee Daybreak Blend<br /><br />[[ASIN: B00451U7T4 Caribou Coffee Daybreak Blend Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)]]<br /><br />I am a fan of light roasts, and since I am also needing to follow an allergen free diet/lifestyle, (No dairy, soy or gluten, etc.), I buy this and all my coffees Whole Bean and grind my own blends.  I just discovered this about a week ago when looking for something to lighten up my current blend of Sam's Members Mark medium roast, Caribou Kenya and Caribou La Minita (Peaberry).  I inadvertently forgot myself and add way too much of the MM, so I bought this, round up about 1/3 C. of beans and added it to my stunningly strong mistaken blend.  WOW!!! It suddenly took on that lightly robust flavor I so love.  And YUMM is an understatement.  It is Art to drink!  In the Fall, I add Amy's blend to my mix, usually only adding about 1- 15. Cups of the Sam's MM to a blend of the other two or three<br />flavors.  Now I am back on track.  I HIGHLY recommend this if you are not a fan of "stand a spoon in the cup" coffee.<br /><br />My recipe:<br />In a tall storage container with good seal put:<br />1/2-3/4 bags each of Caribou Kenya, Peaberry (La Minita) and, if available Amy's Blend, HOWEVER, the Kenya and Peaberry are the most readily available - Be sure to buy enough to carry you for several months).<br />Add 1 C. Sam's Member's Mark<br />&<br />1/2 bag of Caribou Coffee Daybreak Blend.<br /><br />Close lid securely and then turn container about to mix the beans.  Store in the refrigerator.<br /><br />To grind, only grind about 1/2 C. mixed beans at a time and store ground mix in refrig in another securely closed container.<br />YUMMM!!!<br /><br />PS:<br /> This is a VERY Good price!  The best I have seen!!!  And, this is LOVELY all on its own!

And to make it all just a bit better: the bag contains in addition to the bad dried leaves - small particles of grass and herbs dust.

I drink it icy cold and it's like drinking water - no better, no worse.  People can add sweetener and drink it hot or warm also, but I just drink it in place of one of my usual water beverages because that is what I prefer.  It's a health drink and I can't imagine anyone disliking it, and that's the main thing.  You don't have to hold your nose and choke it down.  It's fine.

I tested my blood pressure after drinking it and it was definitely lower than usual.  I've read in other forums that people with low blood pressure should use caution when drinking Soursop juice because it may lower their blood pressure to unsafe levels.

review/summary: This organic Peach Applesauce has a wonderfully delicate flavor that "tastes just like my grandmother used to make!"
review/text: I started buying this unique "applesauce" last summer and was quite pleased with the taste.  The price is steep, but comparable to what I'd pay for it in a store.  I purchased it at Cold Hollow Cider Mill here in Vermont and anything sold there is of the highest quality.  This peach applesauce is pureed and has the texture (if you'd call it that) of baby food.  We usually serve it up with a meal, but they can easily be put in a lunchbox or bag.  They don't have to be chilled and maintain that sweet, delicate peach and apple taste when served warm.<br /><br />NUTRITION FACTS<br /><br />Serving Size - 4 oz.<br />Servings Per Cup - 1<br /><br />Calories - 70<br /><br />Total Fat - 0g<br />Sodium - 0mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate - 16g<br />Dietary Fiber - 2g<br />Sugars - 15g<br /><br />Protein - 1g<br /><br />This peach applesauce has a wonderful homemade taste that I love.  The blend is such that it creates its own unique flavor, something I find very appealing.  Everyone has tried applesauce blended with berries, flavored with cinnamon, and an assortment of fruit blends, but this one is particularly tasty.  It is certified USDA organic and contains "organic apples, organic peach and apple puree, vitamin C, natural flavor." It is also gluten free.  For me it's a definite winner.  It's expensive, but well worth the price ... as they say, you get what you pay for.

review/summary: finding the items we can't live without
review/text: Thank you Amazon.  When my local Natual Foods COOP failed financially last year I was lost in this rural community without many of the foods that had become a part of our daily life.  Twisted fruit is family favorite and Amazon is my favorite suppler.  This is a healthy pocket food for my teenager and a stuffer for my elementry son's lunches.

review/summary: The kids LOVE them (and so does Mom!)
review/text: In the spirit of helping my children learn that healthier eating DOES NOT necessarily mean no more treats, we got a couple of these on a Buy 1, Get 1 deal at a local store. We packed them for lunches on a few different days as a treat, and they have been requested ever since. They taste delicious, according to the kids.<br /><br />As for Mom, I like them because they are much more healthy than the standard high-fructose corn syrup laden "fruit" treats that are typically marketed for kids. We tried the Clif Z-bars first (rave reviews) and then moved on to these. It says a lot to me that these children's treats were among the first to comply with California's more strict school-lunch laws. I have no problem keeping these stocked in the pantry for an occasional treat, and the kids have no problem eating them!

review/text: I have yet to find a kid that does not LOVE these fruit twists!!!  Even the pickiest of kids seems to love them.  They are healthy, delicious and made with really awesome ingredients!  Also, they are great for diabetic kids to keep in their backpacks for when their blood glucose levels get low.  The only flavor I did not care for was the pineapple... but it was still leagues better than the any of the fruit roll-ups brand.

review/text: I think I like these more than my son, who I purchsed them for as an easy and healthy snack.  I don't think there's much difference between the flavors, and the sour apple is fairly tart.  But overall, I think they're good, and they're really a great way to bring a serving of fruit with you anywhere.

review/text: Being a big clif bar fan, I thought these would be great. However, they were very bland. Thankfully they were not sickeningly sweet like a fruit roll up and the ingredients were healthy. When I think of the taste of these snacks, mediocre is the word that comes to mind.<br /><br />Since this is more something I would get for the kids, I had them taste the snacks. They didn't like them at all and refused to even put them in their lunchboxes.<br /><br />These fruit snacks are healthy, but not tasty.

review/text: These fruit ropes are innovative and delicious. Even though they are marketed as a child's product, they truly are great for kids of all ages! I enjoy them as much as my grandchildren. Especially if you are a licorice lover, these twists make an excellent, healthy substitute. Of course, nothing can compare with a child eating a real piece of fruit to get their daily requirements, but for finicky eaters, or when it's treat time, these fruit snacks cannot be beat. Both my grandchildren, and myself, highly recommend them!

review/summary: Convenient on-the-go nutrition, sans sweetener.
review/text: This is a perfectly sized, neatly packaged, fantastically fragrant hunk of hunger-appeasement. Kids will find the plastic wrapper easy to open, and not too hard to crimp shut should they want to save half for later, which they might: dried fruits are always more intense than fresh, and this snack packs a wallop of organic apple puree and organic fruit flavors, bound together with organic apple juice and pectin.  That is some rarified fruity madness.<br />I don't have kids, but if I did I'd sneak these into their backpacks every morning; instead, I keep these in the car and in my purse, for when I get so busy I forget to eat. It happens. I'm blonde. My husband snacks on them before *and* after meals; I can be convinced of their desert-worthiness with a hunk of high grade chocolate sharing their plate.<br />These snacks are a good source of potassium (great for writer's cramp or lost-weekend-recovery), with almost no sodium and very little sugar.  At 70 calories each, they're just the thing when you're too hungry to decide what you want to eat for dinner. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This is an amazing tasting product. It is real fruit, no artificial ingredients. It has a great texture. The size is prefect for a purse, pocket, brief case, or lunch box. It only has 70 calories, which is equivalent to two organic fruit strips. It is the perfect size for a snack in between meals or for a nice energy boost. The only caution is if you have dental work (braces, crowns, loose fillings, etc), you might want to stick with fruit strips. This is very chewy and may cause damage. I found that out the hard way. Otherwise, highly recommended!

review/summary: Fruity and easy to take along :-)
review/text: These fruit snacks come in individual wrappers, so they are good for lunchboxes and travel. They are moist, sweet and fruity - probably high in carbohydrates, but also concentrated with micronutrients. It's a pleasant way to get a serving of fruit when you are not close to a fruit stand.

review/summary: Tart but tasty, my 20 month old loves them too
review/text: I got these through the amazon Vine program. It was nice that they sent a whole pack this time since it allowed both me and my son to try them out.<br /><br />If you look at the ingredients there is no added sugar, the sweetener is apple juice.  There are also some added vitamins in there which is an interesting idea for a fruit snack.<br /><br />When I tried them I thought there were very tart, almost sour, and definitely not overly sweet.  I liked the tartness though, as I am not a big sweet person.  They require a small effort to chew off a bite; not like jerky but tougher than a fruit roll-up.  I was worried that my 20 month old son would have trouble eating them because of the chewiness.<br /><br />Well, my 20 month old would give them 6 stars if he could.  He loves them.  I was surprised he liked them so much since they are a bit sour.  He does have to work some at chewing them; but he seems to like that, he kind of uses them as a teether.  Also they are coated in a light layer of oil so they aren't too sticky in his hands.  I don't know if I will get to eat any more of them because he got the box of them off the counter and has declared that the "Fruities are mine!"  I finally had to hide the box after he ate two of them, so he would lay off and find something else to do :-)<br /><br />All in all a great snack.  I like that all of the sugar is from fruit, that there are some added vitamins, and the taste is great too.  Great snack for my toddler too!

review/summary: Like a Tasty Organic Twizzler, way better than other so called "Fruit Snacks"
review/text: The Clif Kids Twisted Fruit rope is a great product.  It can replace those nasty "fruit flavored" roll ups and "fruit snacks" that are made primarily of corn syrup and artificial color and usually no fruit at all.  The twisted fruit rope is made out of actual furit, and even provides one serving per rope.  The ingredients are simple: apple puree, apple juice concentrate (makes it sweet), flavors, pectin, and fruit and vegetable colorings.  None of the chemicals from those bright "fruit flavored" concoctions, and everything is organic!<br /><br />The taste is great, too.  It's a bit tart, but with a nice berry flavor.  The texture is chewy, and it looks, tastes, and feels like a big Twizzler.  The ropes are packaged individually to throw in lunch boxes or backpacks, but I found myself reaching for at least 2 at a time.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I didn't like.  The strips are a little sticky;  it helps if you hold them by the wrapper instead of taking them out.  The sugar is also still fairly high.  There are 9 grams of sugar, a whopping 45% out of each 20 gram rope.  It's not added refined sugar, but the sugar comes from apple juice concentrate, which is much sweeter than natural apple juice.  Combine that with the sticky nature of the product and it's probably a good idea to have your kids rinse their teeth after eating one.<br /><br />Those drawbacks aside, these snacks remain far superior to candy or those gooey little "fruit snacks" as a tasty treat for kids (or adults!).  Keep in mind actual fruit is always a better choice, but if you need something portable, these are a great option.

review/summary: Awesome, heathy, low calorie boost for the active kid or adult.
review/text: I don't have any kids--that I know of--and I'm not a health nut but I eat a lot of Clif Bars while cycling.  It's the only real food that's truly portable and it comes in a great variety of flavors.  And now they've come out with the same sort of thing for active kids, at a portable and properly sized 70 calories of fruity fueling deliciousness.<br /><br />The thing that Clif understands that most people don't is, snacks are like kindling for the fire that keeps your internal engine going strong.  If you're sitting at your office desk drinking Gatorade and chomping down sports nutrition bars, you're really doing nothing more than producing fat and consuming too much salt (which is what electrolytes are), which increases your blood pressure, adds to stress, et cetera.  On the other hand, if you're out even just walking around the town or city that you live in for more than an hour at a shot (shopping, sightseeing, whatever), and eat something while continuing to move, your body will immediately use that to give you an energy boost, and will burn more calories--given that the activity level continues and is high enough to burn more than you are consuming--by turning to your fat stores next.  People know this instinctively, but tend to overconsume in those times of need.  The sudden influx of calories, particularly sugars, is like spraying lighter fluid on a fire that's already burning--which of course will suddenly burn hotter--ergo, you will lose weight or at least your endurance will increase if you're already thin--but if you consume too many calories at those times your body's systems will be overwhelmed (getting you ready for a recovery nap).<br /><br />I tested these out while cycling, where I usually go an hour before consuming anything but water, then eat a Clif Bar, and go on for another hour for my average ride or several hours during an event such as a 100 mile "Century" ride.  I found that because the twisted fruit rope is just sugary enough and has a good amount of carbs for fuels (with only 70 calories per serving), it gave me an immediate boost that lasted a good half hour.  I only consumed a 70 calories--the calories in one Clif Kid Twisted Fruit, Strawberry--but during that 30 minutes I burned at least 250 calories (if it was a casual ride, which it wasn't).<br /><br /> (During a recent 100 mile bike ride, I burned about 900 calories per hour on average, for 6 hours, which is 5,400 calories or 1.5 pounds of fat, or 2.7 large pizzas worth of calories or 42 Hostess Cupcakes--or 36 PINTS OF GUINNESS!  I would need to eat 77 of these Clif Kid Twisted Fruit, Strawberry ropes to stay even at calories consumed vs. burned, and then add 2050 calories more to account for my resting metabolism.)<br /><br />But I'm not on the bike every day like I used to be, so like any office worker/weekend warrior, I have to do both--consume an enormous amount of calories while at play, and consume a minimum of calories during work days (Wall Street job, power sitting a good 10 hours a day).  This seems the perfect snack for both because it has an extremely reasonable amount of calories--only 70--and yet it's a refreshingly sweet item that will give me a nice little boost maybe twice a day.<br /><br />For a kid, this effect will be far better since kids are more active.  You could give a child two or three of these for the day and tell her/him to eat them whenever they like--which more than likely will be a bit before lunch, another in the afternoon, and another around when they're heading home.  Perfect.  Conversely, if you give your kids money for whatever snacks they like, inevitably they'll get all their calories at once, with lunch and likely from the highest calorie source (and the schools should be sued for selling candy in their cafeterias--so friggin irresponsible).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This kid sized snack is great for even us big kids who sit around all day working.  I don't have any children, but I'll be buying these for myself from now on.  Perfect nutrition for both work and play.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Certified Organic. Kosher Parve. Sweet 'n tangy strawberry flavor. Wonderful fruity aroma. Fun. A single "rope" in an individually wrapped package. Perfect for on-the-go, a quick healthy snack, or your favorite anyone's lunchbag. 70 calories per snack. An organic healthy version of the red twizzlers I used to enjoy when I was a boy. Made with organic apple puree, organic apple juice concentrate, organic flavors, pectin, and fruit & vegetable juice colors. Clif is a trusted brand and leader in healthy organic energy bars and snacks. Another winner just for kids. Hide the box well from any 'big' kids and still young-at-heart adults. Highly recommended.

review/text: I give it credit for being organic but the flavor is off. I got the strawberry and I don't think it tastes like strawberry at all, maybe it's just me but I found that I don't really care for the flavor. The ingredients say everything is organic but it is made from apples and not straberries. It says it has organic flavoring but does not state what the flavoring is from. I don't think I would buy this again only because I didn't like the taste.

I like to find snacks that are nutritious to give to the kids because I don't think starting a habit of eating a lot of junk food all the time is the right message to send. With these they taste good enough that its almost like giving them junk food without them knowing that its good for them.

review/summary: Awesome taste -- and no added sugar!
review/text: I like that this entirely made from organic ingredients, each serving has an entire serving of fruit, and it has no added sugar.  Even the coloring comes from fruit and vegetable juice.  The best part?  It tastes wonderful!  It has a tart strawberry flavor, and the texture is great.  It's not gritty at all, like some natural fruit snacks are.  I got Clif Kid Organic Twisted Fruits to keep around for my grandchildren.  If they're lucky, I *might* still have some left when they get here!  I've definitely got to buy some more.  If I didn't already know these had no added sugar, I never would've guessed it from the taste.<br /><br />I've tried all the flavors.  They're all good, and they all have good texture, but strawberry is my favorite, probably because it tastes purer to me (only one fruit flavor, instead of two or more fruits competing for my taste buds).

review/summary: Not just for kids!
review/text: This is a great item to keep in a desk drawer, brief case, glove box or purse to hold you over until the next meal.  Not only is it organic, but each stick is the equivalent of a serving of fruit.  (Another bonus: no artificial colors or preservatives.)<br /><br />I don't even LIKE strawberry flavored items...I prefer fresh strawberries. That's why this product came as a real surprise. The taste is tart and sweet and fresh.  Excellent!<br /><br />Also, the twisted stick form is easier to eat than the flat fruit "leathers" I tried.  Therefore it would be less messy in the hands of little ones.  (The wrapper can be slid down or pulled back like a banana peel, preventing sticky little fingers...a very helpful feature for snacking in the car.)

review/summary: Chewy Goodness
review/text: This Twisted Fruit is billed as a healthier alternative to other snacks targeted at kids.  This snack boasts one serving of fruit, a good source of vitamins C and B, and tastes almost as good as a less healthy alternative although the strawberry has almost a more grape taste than strawberry.  It also says it is fun it untwist and eat but it really isn't that easy to untwist and the snack itself is a little greasy to hold and you will be reaching to wipe your hands after eating.  Plus the snack does get caught in your teeth like other snacks of its ilk.  But the organic make up and the fact it does leave kids fairly full, adults may want two or more to be satisfied, makes this a much better alternative to the sugar snacks that currently flood the market.

review/summary: Tangy, Convenient, AND It's Healthy
review/text: I got these Clif Kid Twisted Fruit snacks because I'm a fan of other Clif brand products (Clif Bars, Luna Bars, Luna Minis) and I'm always looking for healthy food that's easy to eat on the go.  Even though I'm not a kid, I do enjoy having convenient, go anywhere fruit that I can eat.  I have tried various dried fruits and fruit leathers, but they are always either too dry and tough or too overly sugared.  Clif Twisted Fruit is a nice compromise, while still being all natural.<br /><br />Each twisted fruit is about 70 calories and has the "nutritional value" of a piece of fruit (so says the label).  I'm not sure how they really transfer the nutritional value of actual fruit into a processed product, so I wouldn't recommend this as a fruit substitute, but it does taste good.  The Strawberry flavor I tried is tangy and not overly sugared like most processed strawberry flavors.  The twist is brownish red, like natural strawberry preserves, not bright red. It is sort of gummy like fruit snacks, but the texture is not dry and tough.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed these fruit snacks.  My husband did too.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good lunch/snack food for either kids or adults--both sometimes need to be tricked into healthy eating!

review/summary: Great Snack for the whole family!!
review/text: Everyone in my family loves these. The are a cross between a twizzler and a fruit snack. They come individually wrapped so they are easy to take on the go or throw into lunches. There are 70 calories per package. Which isn't to bad since they are pretty chewy and fun to eat.  I would recommend these to friends and family. They are a treat you can feel good about eating.

review/summary: A healthy, tastier alternative to Twizzlers/Red Vines
review/text: Our three-year-old should probably be writing this review since he can never get enough of these twisted takes on fruit ropes.<br />The Clif Bar folks have taken organic apple and apple juice puree, mixed in a natural strawberry flavor and come up with a healthier version of Red Vines or Twizzlers that packs an intense fruit flavor.<br />Each chewy piece contains one serving of fruit and there are no artifical colors.<br />The pectin leaves a bit of a waxy coating on your lips that feels not unlike lip balm--it would probably be a bonus in the cold, winter months.

review/summary: Not Just for Kids
review/text: Food is one of my obsessions, so I'm always happy to sample something that's possibly delicious AND healthful (and, to conform to my dietary restrictions, vegetarian). This turned out to be a good choice, with organic certification thrown in for good measure.<br />Clif Kid Twisted Fruit contains only fruit puree, fruit and/or vegetable juice, organic flavoring, and pectin. One serving contains a modest 70 calories and, considering the size of the serving, a fairly impressive daily percentage of several vitamins (mostly B's) and minerals. It's definitely the sort of snack you'd encourage your child to eat.<br />All of this, however, is meaningless unless the snack in question, shall we say, exceeds "palatable." No problem! The strawberry flavor explodes in your mouth as soon as you bite in, and it just gets better from there. The flavor is just sweet enough and very tangy, and the texture is chewy and smooth. I imagine that if soaked overnight in some water, a Twisted Fruit would be an excellent addition to a smoothie as well.<br />Twisted Fruits also work for grown-ups. They're easy to toss into a bag for a "whenever" pick-me-up and would be a nice, tasty way to take in some light nutrition after a workout. A versatile, healthful means of satisfying a sweet tooth (or, in my case, "teeth") that's appropriate for all ages.<br />BTW, MANY thanks to Clif Bar and Co. for providing such a generous sample for our review. I like to think that what goes around, comes around.  :)<br />Update: My friend's fruit-loving five-year-old went nuts for them. A hit with the target audience!

review/summary: Great for Adults
review/text: I have long been a big fan of Clif bars (Chocolate Brownie flavor), so I was eager to try this product. I was pleased to see that just one of these ropes equals a full serving of fruit, and that the added sweetening comes from fruit juice.<br />Texture is pleasingly firm, although a friend who tried it wondered whether kids would like it because it the "chew" didn't last long enough. The flavor is intense mainly because of the concentrated fruit content and there is an interesting "sweet-sour" flavor probably due to the added pectin. Kids who are used to very sweet fruit treats may not like this aspect, though.<br />Here's a Pro/Con list to summarize:<br />PRO<br />-Certified USDA organic<br />-Full serving of fruit in each rope<br />-No added sugar or high-fructose corn syrup<br />-Convenient (see comment about packaging, below)<br />CON<br />-Kids may not enjoy the sweet-sour flavor<br />-Individual packaging (it's a compromise between being convenient or being green)

review/summary: I LOVE THEM
review/text: I was hoping they would be good as a healthy snack and they are but best of all THEY TASTE GREAT. It is like biting into a nice fresh tasting granny smith apple. Sweet and  tart at the same time. Chewy enough to give you a nice bite but not tough at all. More like a soft licorice.<br />  I just love that they are not overly sweet. That has always been my problem with these fruit snacks. And just to put the icing on this cake, they are all organic and only 70 calories so they fit nicely into my healthy diet. I slip one into my purse for a nice snack and I also get in one fruit serving for the day.<br />  Good JOB Clif Bar and Com. LOVE THEM

review/summary: These are FANTASTIC...just not quite strawberry.
review/text: Delicious fruit-twists with a great, chewy texture - the twist is thick enough to feel substantial.  Way better than those "Fruit Roll-ups" of old times.  Would definitely recommend to anyone with kids or infants instead of other sweetened snacks (that would probably contain some kind of weird chemical)...this stuff is all natural.<br /><br />The 9 grams of sugar may be a bit much for an 2-3 year old to have more than one or two per day (unless you don't mind them running around with their arms above their head, bouncing off walls, and yelling with a big smile on their face.)<br /><br />On a final note - this review is for the Strawberry flavor.  While it does have sweetness and light strawberry flavor, it is rather "tart" for a strawberry.  In fact, the ingredients don't actually list "strawberries" anywhere in them:  Organic Apple Puree, Organic Apple Juice Concentrate, Organic Flavors, Pectin, colored with Fruit and Vegetable Juice.  With that said...the apple puree/apple juice taste like they were Granny Smith or maybe Gravensteins.<br /><br />So, while not exactly tasting like a fresh picked strawberry by any stretch of the imagination (hence the 4 stars rather than 5), they are very tasty.  (If given a Strawberry one without knowing which flavor it was prior, I don't think everybody would agree that it's strawberry.)  At any rate, I will certainly buy these in the future - will try other flavors to see if they all have "tart apple with hint of &lt;flavor>" flavored.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy and very convenient.
review/text: I'll be short and to the point.  This is a very good product.<br /><br />Each Clif Kid Organic Twisted Fruit serving has only 70 calories, but is all organic with no added sugar.  I think it's a great snack for adults as well as kids.  I'm one of those people with a sweet tooth and I've got to have some form of sweets around at all times.  One thing is for sure, munching on one of these is a lot better for you than reaching for that candy bar.<br /><br />The only slight criticisms I have is that it's a touch more tart than expected and the primary ingredients are "apple puree" and "apple juice concentrate" with no specific mention of strawberries.  Also, while the price is a reasonable value, it's not a terrific one.  I'd strongly recommend that you consider the "Subscribe and Save" option, which knocks an extra 15% off of the price.  You can always cancel S&S later if you change your mind, so there's no downside to signing up and it will save you money.

review/summary: Sadly, one of the only sources of fruit my son will eat!
review/text: I can not express how surprised (and happy!) I was to find out my son loves these fruit ropes.  The Mixed Berry were the first we tried and they are actually pretty tart.  I did not think that would go over well with a kid that really only tolerates a bland banana or apple every now and then.  But he LOVES them.  I added them to Subscribe and Save and almost every month I have to order more before the scheduled delivery.<br /><br />There's not much to them as far as a filling snack, but they apparently satisfy the little ones.  They are "dense" and chewy so they take a few minutes to eat and satisfy the craving to have a snack.  With a full serving of fruit and added nutrients, it seems like a no brainer.  When you include our neighbors that visit all the time, these are a hit with at least ages 3 to 10!<br /><br />I am anxious to try more flavors and will go for the Variety Pack next.

review/text: These are awesome.  They are organic and one full serving of fruit.  They aren't flat, they are wide chewy twists, and they taste like CANDY!  I also love that they are fortified with some extra vitamins because my 3-year-old is a very picky eater.  Since they are pretty thick and a so chewy, I don't give them to my 1-year-old yet.  With him I stick with the flattened fruit.  Don't tell the kids, but I sneak a few of these to work to help get another fruit serving into my own diet.  I love the sour apple.  I just subscribed to get a box every month.  I didn't know you could do that.  Cool!

review/summary: Children LOVE these!
review/text: The first time we ordered the Clif Kid Twisted Fruit Ropes we ordered the Variety Pack to sample all the flavors so we could make a better decision when ordering the next pack.  While my seven-year-old enjoyed every flavor very much, strawberry came out slightly ahead in taste.  This time when we received the strawberry-only pack he was thrilled to have a whole box of his favorite but still hoped for a bit of variety.  While he is an avid fan of the flavor of these fruit twists, I am a fan of the ingredients and am happy to serve them to him.  The wholesome ingredients of the Strawberry flavor are as follows: Organic Apple Puree, Organic Apple Juice Concentrate, Organic Flavors, Pectin, Colored with Fruit and Vegetable Juice.<br /><br />These fruit twists make a great alternative to the fruit snacks his friends seem to always get in their lunchbox but are a much healthier choice.  If my son is not able to finish his lunch (which seems to be the case most days with the school's 10-15 minute time allotment for lunch) after school during pick-up he will take the fruit twists out of his lunchbox and the other children beg him to trade with him.  Most times he refuses because he enjoys them so much.  I will be re-buying these and packing these in his lunch every once in awhile for a treat.  However, when ordering again I will probably choose the Variety Pack as you get a 24 pack for the same price as a single flavored 18 pack.<br /><br />My personal opinion of the product's flavor is that it is delicious but a bit too sour/tart/tangy.  I can't eat them on a regular basis but my child who loves sour/tart fruit and the occasional sour candy says it is perfect.  Additionally, the product does have a tendency to stick to the teeth.  My child's molars are sealed and he has never had a cavity so it is not an issue for our family but may be something to consider in your purchase.

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: The taste just isn't good enough to fit the price.  Overpriced, not healthy enough for that "organic and good for you!" price and the taste didn't impress anyone in my family including a slew of teenagers.  It will now sit in my closet. Sticky/chewy/tart/odd flavor is how I'd describe it.  I bought it after reading the good reviews but it's just too strange a taste for us to ever repurchase or to justify that high price.

review/summary: Real fruit, unreal flavors.
review/text: I was expecting the  strawberry flavored CLIF kid Organic Twisted Fruit to contain strawberries, but the ingredient list doesn't mention strawberries at all. It is made from organic apple puree and apple juice concetrate and "organic flavors" (whatever that means).<br />The list of vitamins and minerals is rather extensive, and I don't doubt the "One Serving of Fruit" claim is valid. So it is a relatively healthy snack.<br />How does it taste? Very tart with a flavor similar to old strawberry preserves.<br />Will kids eat it? Yes. After trying one, my daughter took a few to school with her.

review/summary: Really great tasting snack
review/text: With a delicious strawberry flavor, these fruit twists have a great texture, easy to chew  and they are organic!  I liked them a lot better than the fruit strip type products, which tend to be sticky and a bit tough to bite or chew.

review/summary: Strawberry Twisted Fruit Review
review/text: What an awesome yummy taste this twisted fruit has!  You take a bite and the sweet and tangy taste explodes in your mouth.  I love it, my kids love them and that it has a whole serving of fruit per piece is wonderful!  It's organic to boot and has 18 pieces per pack allowing for a special treat for lunches or a healthy snack for after school.  Our family will look forward to ordering and eating more!  :)

review/summary: 9 yr olds ate the entire box
review/text: I didn't like this product all that well. It was really tangy and hurt my stomach. I was more than a little surprised when my picky eater 9 yr olds ate 17 sticks in one sitting between them. I guess that's why they are labeled for KIDS.

review/summary: intense and somewhat sour
review/text: This strawberry product does not taste very sweet and is not as candy like as traditional fruit roll ups.  It is a shorter all natural version of the Twizzler strawberry licorice straw.

review/summary: delicous snack for picky kids
review/text: These are very good and good for you.  A full serving of fruit and not like the other fruit snacks you buy.  They are a bit tart, but in a good way.  I tried the Strawberry and enjoyed them a lot.  The kids around here also really liked them as well.  They are chewy, but do not get stuck in teeth.  Great product.

review/summary: Tastes bad, smell weird.
review/text: Well, I was sad when all of my kids thought these were nasty.  They LOVE the Clif Z-Bars, so I thought these would be kid friendly also. Not so much.<br />I have the big variety box, and we've tried all of the flavors...none of them was a hit.

review/summary: Tasty, but doesn't leave you full; high calories, expensive.
review/text: The Clif bar organic fruit comes in a plastic wrapper that is easy to open so kids (or adults with frail hands) wont have any trouble opening it.  The actual piece of nourishment is only a few inches long as is very sticky so you don't want to get your hands on it<br /><br />There's a slightly spicy, fruity taste to the strawberry flavor I consumed.  I was able to chomp down on the stick in a matter of seconds and I was left not feeling full either.  I could easily eat several of these in one sitting -- but you wouldn't want to do that as these have 70 calories a piece.  If children are consuming these you really need to watch out that they don't have access to too many as they too could easily eat several of these in front of a TV (will make them FAT).<br /><br />Overall, I am not happy about the high calorie count versus feeling of fullness.  Even a granola bar leaves me far more satisfied, but these fruit sticks do no such thing.  The prices is also high, being about 90 cents a piece when bought in the bulk pack.  I would like to see the price decrease to 50 cents a piece at least.  As such, I am awarding only 3 stars to this product.

review/summary: Best thing since Sliced Bread....Awesome !!!
review/text: I am not a big fan of fruit roll-ups as they tend to be more like candy than fruit with added sugar. These Twisted Fruit ropes are a "whole" other story. They are Organic and provide ONE FULL Serving of Fruit! Each one is 70 calories and best of it, they are satisfying. And I love its dense, chewy texture. It's SO GOOD that I enjoy it as much as my children do ! So far, I have had the pleasure of trying the strawberry, sour apple, and tropical fruit twists. I love them all although the sour apple is indeed "sour". It will make your mouth pucker which I personally love but I buy the strawberry & tropical flavors for my children. I just wish that they were less expensive but I can see how they cost more to produce so I am willing to pay more to get a better, more nutritious fruit snack ! Btw, Amazon has the best prices on these esp. if you "subscribe and save". They are not yet readily available and at my Whole Foods Supermarket, they sell for 99 cents EACH !
