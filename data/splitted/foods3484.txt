review/summary: changed the ingredients!!
review/text: I have been ordering this coconut milk forever because it had NO additives. I just received my latest shipment, popped open a can, and had a little taste. It didn't taste right, so I looked at the label. They've just started adding guar gum! My son can't have that, so the case is useless. I just looked at a can from my last order. They've changed it. What a waste.

review/summary: Very runny
review/text: This is very runny. I used it in my coffee and it doesn't add the creaminess that Thai Kitchen's coconut milk did. It also doesn't have that coconut milk flavor. It just tastes bland. I'm quite disappointed. Now I have 11 cans I have to figure out how to use.<br /><br />I wanted to update. The can has a money-back guarantee printed on the label. I emailed them and they sent me a refund. While I'm still unhappy with the product, the customer service was fantastic.

review/summary: No longer as advertised
review/text: The first two cases I bought were very satisfactory. I mixed the coconut milk into a shake, along with bananas and cocoa and drank it straight. It was great, very fresh. I could use it on anything: salads, etc. The third case I bought had a completely different texture, smooth and creamy versus the flaky, part solid/part liquid texture of the first two cases. Unsure about it, I put a sparing amount in my shake. Minutes later, my stomach starting to act up. It couldn't digest this coconut milk properly. My wife's stomach's reaction was even worse than mine. (I've also had a similar reaction before with another brand of coconut milk, bought much less expensively at an Asian grocery). So then I looked at the ingredients, and lo and behold, there were at the end: "guar gum, stabilizers." Looking back at the description of this item here on Amazon, I see it says "No Preservatives. No Stabilizers." I also have found from other reviews that people have discovered the ingredients have changed. A once-great product is no longer, and in fact, is not as advertised.

review/summary: Very good quality, natural coconut milk
review/text: A very good quality, natural coconut milk with no additives. I bought a case of this online after trying the coconut milk available at the supermarket in my new home town - pretty dire (Thai Kitchen). This is just what is says on the tin: coconut milk, no additives, does what it should: separates into liquid and hard coconut milk/fat in the can when cold. Perfect for Thai green curry. No artificial taste or texture (the other milk tasted like a thin paste made from flour and water). Five stars. Gonna buy another dozen cans soon...

review/text: I ordered a case of this about four months ago to replenish my dwindling supply of coconut milk.  Fast-forward to today and you can imagine my shock when I opened not one but two! cans of coconut milk with the foulest odor imaginable.  I also notice that the taste is not so much of a coconut flavor AND it seems to be runnier than other coconut milks.  I hope this is just an odd batch and does not happen to my next batch.  Does anyone have the same experience with this brand of milk???

review/summary: Does Not Taste Like Coconut
review/text: I bought this brand of coconut milk after a great deal of research. I wanted to avoid the additives and preservatives that most other brands contain. I have made my own coconut milk at home in the past from dessicafed coconut. It turns out incredibly delicious but is a LOT of work. I was looking for a convenient and safe alternative. Natural value was a huge disappointment. There is nothing about the taste or smell that suggests that it is made out of coconut. It has an unappealing bland taste. Why buy coconut milk if it tastes nothing like coconut? I will never purchase this product again.

review/summary: The best available!
review/text: My family drinks a lot of coconut milk (about a can a day) and this is one of the best brands available.  I also recommend Chaokoh but it isn't available directly from Amazon yet and is probably better to just purchase locally.  This Natural Value Coconut Milk is one of the few that has no fillers or preservatives though which means it is perfect for making healthy coconut yogurt with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SUHY">Salton YM9 1-Quart Yogurt Maker</a>.  If you haven't tried making coconut yogurt yet I highly recommend it!<br /><br />A lot of people are still under the impression that Coconut milk is bad for you.  There was some faulty research done years ago on hydrogenated coconut oil which is mostly to blame for this.  If you are one of those people that are still convinced coconut is bad I highly recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416569502">The Good Fat Cookbook</a>.

I use it for baking, cooking, anywhere I would use milk. And if you don't know what to do with the congealed oil at the top of the can, you can either heat the can a little and it will melt back into the coconut milk, or you can take it out of the can and use it in place of butter.

review/text: Although some extraction methods might be superior, or other products be organic, this one suits my needs very well, and the price can't be beat with the shelf price in local supermarkets at about $3 to $4 per can. The ingredients of Natural Value are "Pure Coconut Extract, Water" and the fat content is 17 to 19 %. It is very rich and creamy with a mild flavor and aroma, and works well in Indian cooking. I took off one star because the cans are not BPA free. I am disappointed that it is not currently available as I went through a full case very quickly.

review/summary: Odd taste/smell and texture...
review/text: I have purchased the Organic coconut milk many times.  It has a fresh, coconut taste and is very smooth.  But, it has guar gum added.  I decided to give the regular Natural Value a try (non-organic, no guar gum).  It is a very different product.  The coconut milk has a strange smell and flavor.  It is unpleasant and does not taste like coconut.  The can contains a lot of liquid and the coconut solid is somewhat grainy in texture compared to the organic.  Overall, I am unhappy with this product.  I cannot recommend it.

Well, when I scooped this one out, and tried to whip it I was extremely disappointed! It turned into a liquid and wouldn't whip up at all! And not only that, but there is no "USDA organic" label on the cans. It says "natural" but I'm really not convinced. I think that label most of the time is a gimmick anyway. I think I'm going to just get mine at Whole Foods next time. I know that kind was truly organic and it whipped.

review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

Showed up in 3 days.<br />The salt has undertones of clay, which gives it a deeper flavor and was used as a rub it the recipe.  The liquid smoke overpowered it, but the flavor was there.  I think it best used as a rub or finishing salt.<br />There is also black Hawaiian salt... somehow mixed in with lava!  Have to try that next...<br />P.S.  The salt was well packaged in a jar.

review/text: I "borrowed" a couple of these from a popular seafood resturant several years ago.  I have searched for them for a long time.  VERY easy to use, does a great job on the giant crab legs.  Much easier than "crackers".

review/summary: Smooth & Awakening!
review/text: Tazo Awake Full Leaf Tea is the best black tea I have ever tasted.  It is much better than the ground tea bags you would find in the grocery store (even of the same brand and type!).  It is very smooth, yet bold, delicious drank straight or with a splash of milk and a little sugar.<br /><br />The caffeine content is perfect to give you a little heart racing boost and get your day started.  I am not a coffee drinker so I use this as my morning wake up drink.  Love it and always have it on me, even when traveling.

review/summary: Great work and on the go tea
review/text: I am a big fan of drinking tea, and love a good earl grey.  This is one of the best earl greys you can get, unless you upgrade to the loose leaf teas.  It's great at work and on the go, where you don't have time or equipment to brew loose leaf teas.  The tea holds up well through a range of temperatures and doesn't taste as bitter as some others out there.  I recommend brewing it at temperature below boiling to produce smoother flavor (I usually add a little bit of cold water to the cup before pouring in boiling water to control the steeping).  The only downside is it's a little expensive for 15 servings.  Would recommend without hesitation to anybody looking for a decent earl grey.

review/text: The packaging is great for a gift.  The teabags are pyramidal in shape.  As far as taste, if you're just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla, then this Tazo brand will do it for you. If you're looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste, then the addition of vanilla at least in this brand of tea, Tazo, will disappoint you.  The raw rooibos taste, without these "improvements" such as vanilla, is full-bodied and has its own unique taste.  I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings, Republic of Tea, and Numi.

review/text: I tried this tea as my introduction to Rooibos.  I was very excited after hearing of the benefits of rooibos.  To my dissapointment I thought this tea was disgusting!<br /><br /> Luckily, I didn't give up and tried other brands (Numi and Yogi are great) of rooibos and they were all fantastic.  This tea has a stale vanilla taste that completely covers up the natural flavor of rooibos.  Stay away from this tea.  Plain rooibos without added flavors is perfect on it's own.

review/summary: Wonderful treat gone bad
review/text: My two dogs USED TO LOVE these treats. Just the right size - not giant (and therefore affordable) but they still took a while for them to chew through. These WERE their favorite treats. And they were healthy and good for their teeth and gums.<br />But having received a recent re-order, I am now editing my own review and downgrading from five stars to one. THEY HAVE CHANGED THESE TREATS. They are NOT WRAPPED IN CHICKEN anymore. They have some kind of PAINT on them instead of chicken. It doesn't even smell like chicken. This is so disappointing. If you are re-ordering these thinking you'll get the old wonderful Chewritos - you won't. Change is significant enough that I recommend NOT ORDERING. It's misleading labeling. It's NOT a chicken wrap. It is a rawhide wrap that has been dipped in some kind of chemical/yeast/smoke flavor coating.

review/text: Product says "duck wraps rawhide treats", sounds great, right? well this is the sorriest dog treat I have ever purchased, and I have purchased a lot of them.  First, there is no duck, the item is coated with some brown crusty dyed-on stuff, looks like it is painted on.  Then the so-called rawhide is more like a 3 by 4 inch piece of cardboard, folded into thirds.  I know cardboard when I see it!  My dog likes to lick the brown stuff off, but then nothing.  And he even likes cardboard!! don't waste your money.

When I went to re-order, I read the review about the treats now being "basted" with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird, because my order was the same. That is, until I received this last order of 4 packs this week. All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor -- my dog, who was usually so excited to get one of these treats, left it on the floor untouched. We are both VERY disappointed -- not at Amazon, but at the manufacturer for changing their product

review/summary: Will No Longer Buy These!
review/text: Retracted my ringing endorsement of the product from 6 months ago.  Like other reviewers, I just now experienced Beefeaters (the manufacturers) switch from an excellent product to one that is subpar at best. Even more insulting is the dramatic increase in price $5.99 to $8.99-$10.99 per pack) for this terrible product. My pug will no longer touch these "duck wraps", the product name is false advertising at best. Previously these rawhides were wrapped with dried duck.  Now they are spray painted orange and smell funny.  I have nothing against the online sellers of this product.  However these sellers should contact Beefeaters and voice concern about losing so many loyal buyers.  And the buyers?  Well all of us should contact Beefeaters customer service and voice your disappointment regarding the duck wrap product change. Fingers crossed we can get back to the excellent duck wraps of the past for our beloved dogs!

review/text: This product has changed from the original that my dogs loved. These are NOT wrapped in chicken as the packaging and product description will have you believe. This is my 2nd attempt to get the old product without success. Evidently, these have replaced the quality product we used to receive. When I opened them I discovered these flimsy strips of rawhide that are now painted with this mystery substance. The rawhide is like very thin cardboard. There is absolutely NO chicken on these. I contacted Beefeaters and they have not responded. This company is advertising falsely and making a huge profit on this garbage!! Save your money and start looking for a new product. My dogs would not touch these!! I will not be purchasing anything made by this company again. They raised the prices on these too, while replacing quality with crap. So disappointing!

review/summary: Excellent low calorie cereal
review/text: I have used Nature's Path Kamut since a puffed cereal recall several years ago. An whole year's production of supermarket brands made by Malt-O-Meal was recalled due to salmonella found in "routine testing." Once a year is not routine enough for me, so I swore off Malt-O-Meal or puffed store brands that might be made by them. Kamut was found at Whole Foods; twice the price but tastier, organic and worth the difference. Recently Whole Foods was out of stock and I discovered Amazon's 12 pack. Compared to stronger flavored cereals, like Honey Nut Cheerios or granolas, Kamut may seem a bit bland. I mix it with with Honey Nut Cheerios and Trader Joe's Just The Clusters.<br /><br />A note of caution -- the product expiration date of my shipment (oops, "best by" in marketing lingo) had a scant 7 months left. The solution was to increase the Kamut in my mixture to about half the bowl. At just 50 calories per cup, a greater proportion of Kamut lowers the total calorie count. If Amazon can warrant an expiration date no less than 6 months out, putting Kamut on subscription (15% off plus free shipping) is an attractive option.<br /><br />An amusing aspect is the Kamut history printed on the back of the bag (originated 6,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent) coupled with the Kamut trademark symbol. The world's first trademark registry must have been located on the banks of the Nile. Anyone making it past the crocodiles got to register his trademark.

review/summary: 3 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

review/text: This is serious tea and not a flowery watered down drink.  I take it hot and occasionally with milk but I bet it'd be nice and effective on ice.  It's a little spendy but more than worth the price.  It's worked better than coffee for keeping me alert and is not harsh on the tummy as coffee tends to be.  If you have to be to bed early, don't drink this tea after noon.  Enjoy!

review/text: I was pleased to discover this product again after Sam's Club quit selling it.  However, the pricing per unit at Amazon.com is almost as high as in stores when the smaller individual packages go on sale.  The previous price at Sam's Club was about $6.48-$6.75 per box.  On line it runs about $10 per box or about .55 per tub.  The box is more convenient but not necessarily less expensive.

review/summary: I've Got A Case of the Hershey Squirts...
review/text: Oh, c'mon grow up...I happen to call Hershey Kisses, Hershey Squirts...y'know, as in small...which exactly what Hershey Kisses are; small yet incredibly satisfying and I just bought myself a 25lb case to prove how much I love them. Of course, I don't eat too many of them because then I really will have a case of the you-know-what's...<br /><br />So you might ask yourself, "Why would anyone in their right mind buy a 25lb case of Hershey Kisses?" And I got a good answer for you, I don't know. Chocolics do weird things. It seemed like a good idea at the time.<br />I think I was just reasoning with myself how I wouldn't have to keep driving to the store and picking up a bag of my favorite treats...now I had a whole case and suddenly they didn't look so appealing...in fact, at one time I could have sworn that they were mocking me!<br /><br />Yeah, these things were getting me into trouble...<br /><br />It was a very hot Southern California afternoon a few weeks back and I was innocently watering the plants in my front yard and it was hot, y'know, so I didn't have a shirt on. I see the neighbor kid walking down the sidewalk and I just say, "Hey, kid...want some candy?" So he says, "Yeah!" I run in the house real fast and I give him a bag of foil wrapped chocolate magic and he looks like he just hit pay dirt. He runs into his house and says, "MOM! The nice man without a shirt on just gave me some candy!!!!"<br /><br />Next thing I know, the cops are at my house.<br /><br />I didn't know why but all I could think of saying, "Boy, officer, do I have some sweet kisses for you!" The next thing I knew, I was in the patrol car with the cop saying, "Oh, you're going to fit right in with the rest of the sickos..."<br /><br />My wife came to bail me out and she said that she would've gotten there sooner but she tripped over a 25lb case of Hershey Kisses and sprained her ankle.<br /><br />A lot of people speculate if there really is such a thing as too much of a good thing. I would have to say, yes, yes, there is. Stick with the smaller, more manageable bags. Don't go crazy. Now if you excuse me I have a 43 gallon tub of ice cream in the freezer calling my name.<br /><br />Peace & Blessings,<br />john, 'the Light Coach'

review/summary: Very delicious!
review/text: I love love love tart cherry preserves, and these are among the best I've ever tasted. The ingredients are: sour cherries, pure cane sugar. As such, they have a texture and color that is much more like homemade than even "gourmet" store bought. The color is a deep deep red/purple, almost black. The taste is very tart and delicious cherry, and is a nice contrast to almost anything that is savory or sweet.<br /><br />My only regret is buying the pack of 6 10 oz. jars; the price of 3 18 ox. jars is a much better value. However, without preservatives, I'm not sure how long they'll stay fresh in the fridge, so maybe smaller jars are the way to go.<br /><br />By the way, shipping was very fast and free!!  I received my order in less than 3 days.

review/text: The grind is fairly coarse so there is not a lot of extraction, use a little more coffee when you brew and you will be rewarded with a smooth, full, non acidic cup of coffee. I have been a drinker of Peet's and Starbucks for years but found the high acidity upsetting if I drank more than a cup or two. Recently a friend of mine from Germany introduced us to this coffee and we have been sold ever since. If you like a darker roast, and a coffee with a finer grind then get the expresso roast (d'Oro) we use this in our drip coffee maker as well for a different but equally non acidic cup of coffee

review/text: I agree with some of the reviewers about the coarseness of the grind and how light tasting it is. The taste is what I really like about this brand. Really a great breakfast coffee with milk and sugar. True, if you love Starbucks, than it is probably not for you. I brewed a pot and noticed how light the color appeared and thought it was not going to be good. I was wrong. In fact, I ran out and am now fiendishly craving a cup. All the other supermarket brands seem too bold tasting. The can cost me the same as Chock Full 'O' Nuts or Folgers and I prefer it. It was the red can that caught my eye, but the mellow taste that I really enjoy. Hey, if you don't like it, mail the extra to me.
