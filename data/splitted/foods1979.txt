review/text: I had these type of olives in a dirty martini in a very nice steak house in Michigan and have been looking for them ever since. I was so excited to see them being sold on Amazon. I had no problem with delivery and soon made myself a dirty martini. I love hot food in any form and these didn't disappoint. They are nice and hot but also have a very zippy flavor to them.  Also I made my martini with Dirty Sue dirty martini mix that I got on Amazon. Together they make the PERFECT DIRTY MARTINI!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00119Q3EQ">The Original Dirty Sue Dirty Martini Mix, 12.69-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Envigorating Flavors, however . . .
review/text: Alwadi missed the 5-star rating because I had a deeevil of a time cooking them.  They disintegrated.  It wound up more like "falafel crumbs".  Still exceptionally tasty, just messy.  I used the correct - really correct - amount of water, allowed it to sit for the specified time --- or maybe a little longer, as it didn't look like it was really drinking up the H20.  Next time, I'll just use a little less earth juice.  You can always add it (like with so many things!) but you can't take it out.  I'm certain my next batch will be so improved, I'll forget this semi-failure.  Once again, let me roll this important little falafel ball home, the stuff is wonderfully flavorful, just watch the liquid addition.  Needs no further spicing, either.  Will I order another case? You can roll your pita on that one!

review/summary: A tip for making falafel balls
review/text: I have not bought this brand of falafel but since the previous reviewer had difficulty with keeping the ball together here is a tip:<br /><br />The Lebanese use a special tool to make this ball -kinda like a flattened ice cream scoop.  Try and get this tool if you can in your local middle eastern store.  Also make sure that the oil is very hot when you drop the ball in it.  good luck.

review/summary: Not bad falafel, but...
review/text: This falafel isn't bad, it's got some interesting ingredients like crushed wheat that add to texture and the spices are good, but...I expect that falafel mix has a fairly long shelf life, being a dry good and everything, and the case I got was dated to expire in a few months.  I like falafel and everything, but now I'm going to have to eat it at least once a week in order to use it before it expires.  This is disappointing because I was thinking more along the lines of eating it once a month for the rest of the year.  It also makes me wonder exactly how old my case actually IS, since I would think falafel mix would be good for a few years.  Add that to the fact that it's not really any better than the mix I can buy in bulk at my local supermarket, and that it was considerably more expensive, I was overall not really pleased with this purchase.

review/summary: Our favorite breakfast coffee..
review/text: We've been drinking Millstone French Vanilla ground coffee every morning for a couple of years now. It's a very pleasant mellow tasting morning treat. It has none of the bitter/burned taste that some of the other "Gourmet" coffees have.<br /><br />Obviously, my wife and I like it very much. We were dismayed following Katrina when it became hard to find due to Millstone being located in New Orleans. I was pleased to find it at a reasonable price here via Amazon.<br /><br />We brew our coffee in a Bunn-O-Matic coffee maker because its controlled lower temperature drip brewing is much preferred over the more conventional percolated type of brewer where the brewing water temperature is essentially boiling. The Bunn keeps its water reservoir at 197 degrees which makes a surprising difference in the oils that are extracted from the grind. It definitely reduces bitterness.

review/summary: PRETTY GOOD COFFEE
review/text: Let's face it , coffee that has already been ground is never going to be as good as fresh ground. For already ground coffee this is pretty good. Not as good as I expected though from other readers.  I also purchased it because they use this brand in Denney's restauarant and I always loved their regular coffee. I think the vanilla is what I am not liking so much in this and I would rather add my own natural vanilla syrup made with sugar not corn syrup. I will buy the plain Millstone  and hope it tastes a little like Denney's. I did like it better when I brewed it really strong like espresso, and boiled milk to add to it. It smoothed out the strong vanilla taste. Oh, used a french press with it. Thinking about going to the Cuizinart pod 200.00 coffee maker for variety and ease of use. Expensive but maybe might be worth the investment  the way we use coffee around here. Also can use the hot water for instant  soups, noodles etc. I really want great tasting coffee tea or hot chocolate when I want it. Everyone around here likes something different.

review/summary: Not Bad Coffee - Great Price
review/text: This coffee smelled very artificial when I first opened it, which was a bit off-putting for me. I enjoy smelling coffee in the morning before I brew or drink it. However, once it is brewed the scent becomes pleasant.<br /><br />As for the flavor, this coffee is good, very vanilla and quite tasty. Not something I would drink black, but it tastes fine with a bit of milk and sugar.<br /><br />The shipping was fast and the packaging was great, as always from Amazon.<br /><br />I use a French press now, so I grind my own coffee, but if I switched back to a drip machine I would probably buy this again. If you're looking for something tasty, vanilla and cheap, try this coffee and see if you like it!

review/summary: Could be more flavorful
review/text: My husband and I drink a lot of coffee every day (our last vice), mostly vanilla or chocolate flavored.  He loves this coffee, period.  On the other hand, I can barely tell it's flavored.  There is very little vanilla aroma in the bag, in the coffee maker, or when it's in the cup.  I checked the expiration date, which is June 2011, so it's not that.  The flavoring is just subtle.  If you prefer a light touch in flavored coffee, you will like this; I prefer there to be more vanilla aroma and flavor.  This really is a medium coffee, and there is no particular acidity.  The price is right, at about $7.32 a pound with super saver shipping (on qualifying purchases over $25).

review/summary: My dogs love these
review/text: These are great treats, and my dogs love them, but I don't use them as they are designed.  I usually buy 2 packages and then use each piece as a separate treat (2 sticks, 4 flowers).  My flat-coat has a sensitive stomach and once he starts eating something, he can't (won't) give it up.  By giving him each piece separately, I can monitor how much he gets and it is much better on his digestive system.  They do make a bit of a mess, so I either use them outside or in an area that is easy to clean up the drool that ultimately is left when they are done.  They love them so much!

review/summary: Doesn't last any longer than Everlasting treat
review/text: My dog enjoys these treats, but they don't last. The very first time he got an everlasting treat it took him a couple of days to gnaw and lick the rounded treats out of the ball holder. Ever since though, he has figured out how to get the treats out of the ball quickly, then chews them up like biscuits.<br /><br />Thought the interlocking screw-on idea might keep the treats in the ball longer, but I think my dog just chewed off the end of the central threaded stick and then easily removed the treats as usual.<br /><br />Enjoyable but expensive for the short amount of time they last. Also, not sure of the calorie count? My dog is an 85lb young male german shepherd.

review/summary: NEVER-lasting Treats
review/text: It took my dog more than an hour to make it through each of his first two ever-lasting treats.  I thought the ever-locking treats would slow him down even more.  Not so.  Because the edges of the disc pieces are scalloped (rather than smooth like the ever-lasting treats), they don't stay wedged down in the ball as well.  My dog can get the first one out in less than five minutes.  You'd think the twisting "lock" would at least add some complexity, but you'd be wrong.  As soon as my dog chomped through the first disc, he shoved the "stick" back through the ball, using it to pop out disc number two.  It probably would have taken him longer to wolf down the entire contraption if I'd just handed the treats to him in their original packaging.  Fabulous idea; poor results.

review/text: I tried this decaf and found it to be an pretty good. Thought I would give it a second try but when I went to order more it was out of stock. I called Jeremiah's Pick directly to find out about that. A rude detached phone sales person responded with a flat voiced response: "It's out of stock". I asked how long she thought it would be before they roasted more and had it back in stock and she said: "It's out of stock". So I was curious and asked her if it would ever be back in stock and she said: "it's out of stock". I asked one final question in hopes of finding out whether I would ever be able to get it again. I asked why they were out of stock. Was it a bean shortage, a roasting delay- please give me any insight you could about the future prospect of being able to buy this product. The response? A flat, no energy "it's out of stock". What poor customer relations. I will never try to order this coffee again. Customer service is important. I switched over to BackCountry "No Trace" organic, water processed fair trade decaf and this was a wonderful surprise. I was in luck. BackCountry is now my top of the list, great flavor and aroma and their service is friendly and they ship the same day they roast. Love BackCountry coffee. Hey Jeremiah's Pick....

review/text: I chose this coffee because I was looking for a full-bodied decaf but preferred one decaffeinated via a more natural method. Unfortunately, I found the coffee bitter and burnt tasting. It does take more coffee to make a decent cup (which decaf doesn't?), heightening the burnt flavor, but brewing with less coffee just made it watery and still burnt tasting. I'm giving it 2 stars because at least it wasn't bland like much decaf coffee. Overall, though, I found it disappointing.

review/summary: Good coffee!
review/text: The coffee is good and since it is water processed for decafeinating, it is much healthier for the body! I would like a light roast rather than the dark roast Jeremiah supplies? I would of rated this purchase with 5 stars if there was a lighter roast decaf. I ise it in my Mr. Coffee expresso machine and it has good taste whether I make an expresso or cappucino!

review/summary: I LOVE this coffee!
review/text: I'm not a huge fan of coffee, but this coffee is sooo smooth.  I will drink more than one cup.  I don't know what makes this coffee so good, but I would like to order it again and again.  I would like to think that it is because it is organic, but not all organic coffees taste this smooth.  So that leads me to believe that it is because it is water processed.  I will have to try another water processed coffee before I can truly say that is why.<br /><br />My husband on the other hand does not love this coffee.  He really likes D&D's, which I detest.  He also enjoys good ole Folgers.  I think it is a difference in taste buds, as we prefer different amounts of "flavor" (aka salt) on our foods.<br /><br />Because of our differences of opinion, I give this coffee an avg. of 4 stars: 5 from me, and 3 from him.

review/summary: Great bargain, nice features, and tasty!
review/text: With Subscribe & Save, I get this shipped to my own every few months for about $6.00 a bag. That is MUCH less than buying in stores, and this product has the added feature of being both organically grown coffee and decaffeinated using the Swiss Process which means no wierd chemical bath to remove the caffeine. We love the dark roast and find this a great complement to our regular coffee. Just be aware this is only a 10oz bag so will go a little quicker than the normal grocery size bags (16oz).

review/summary: Buy these smaller bags to maintain freshness
review/text: My little dog loves Beneful dog food, and initially she ate the regular size kibble.  I noticed, however, that she had to spend a lot of time breaking the pieces into bites that she could then easily eat.  When they came out with these little IncrediBites, I knew she would love them.  They are so much easier for her to chew, and she doesn't leave crumbs all over the kitchen floor like she did with the big pieces.<br /><br />The only problem I have had is that I've only been able to find the 16-pound bags in the stores in my area.  That includes all the grocery stores, Walmart, Target, etc.  I bought the big bag, and it lasted for many months.  I have read that it's better to buy the amount of dry dog food that your dog will eat within about a month.  Otherwise, the dog food loses moisture and nutrients, can become moldy, becomes hard, and becomes less flavorful.  It may seem like a good idea to buy huge bags to save money, but you end up losing something in quality.  So for my tiny dog who eats such small amounts each day, I really wanted a smaller bag.  Fortunately I found this 7-pound bag here on Amazon, and with my Prime membership, it was shipped for free.  Can't beat that.

review/summary: One of my best purchases ever.  A near lifetime supply.
review/text: Nearly 15 years ago, I bought one of these cases.  Even though I partake in Sen-sen regularly, it takes weeks to get through one of the packets.  Sometimes I forget about them, but when I'm dieting, the teensy long-lasting squares, which come like 300 per packet, always help to keep my mind of food with a lot more calories.<br /><br />Not everybody likes these.  I offer them all the time, but only about 3 in 10 people like them.  Most people can't seem to stand them.  If you like licorice, and maybe angostura bitter, then maybe you'll like these.  If it's handy, try 1 drop of bitters.  If you liked that, you might like one tiny square of these strong things.<br /><br />Highly recommended, especially if you have a sweet tooth and are trying to lose weight.  But try just on square in one packet, first.

review/text: I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.  Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away.

There is a distinct foul odor when you open the bag for the first time.  After airing the bag out, the first piece I tasted was like chewing shoe leather, dry and chewy without much flavor.  After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.

These 2 purchases were the worst possible way to spend my money.  The meat was so dry I was not sure if I was eating dried rat tail or beef jerkey.  The "meat" caused sickness and lock jaw.  Jacks links is as good as scraps off leather shoes.  It was pretty incredible of them to sponser the WSOP but provide poor quality food at a ridiculous price.

review/summary: lost one bag of my "jack link's" beef jerky
review/text: I am a regular subscriber of this "Jack Link's" beef jerky terriyaki. This morning, I opened the new box from Amazon and found that there are only 9 bags in the box while it supposed to be 10. I used to trust Amazon and this is the first time that I check the quantity in the box. Since the inside box is open, so someone might have taken one during the packing process because s/he loves it so much but I hate to lose one bag of my Jack Links beef jerky!!

review/summary: Great snack....even during battle!!
review/text: I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!

review/summary: bad beef
review/text: I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you.

review/summary: Cheaper at Walmart
review/text: Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free.

review/summary: Delicious jerky
review/text: This is probably the best mass-produced beef jerky on the market.  It isn't too tough or dry like cheaper brands, isn't too sweet or spicy either.  Only problem is that as a snack I feel it isn't overly healthy.  (It has MSG, sodium nitrite and a lot of sodium).  However it is a low-fat, high-protein food, and very tasty.

review/summary: Great
review/text: I bought this flavor for the first time at the store, when they were out of my favorite (Sweet N Hot). My kids (ages 4 and 2) were begging me for some when we got back to the car. I told them they could try it, but that it would be spicy. They agreed, took the small bites I gave them and continued to ask for more until the entire package was gone! The flavor is exactly as the title describes. It's sweet and spicy, and reminds me of a dish I would order at a Thai restaurant. It's not as Spicy as the Sweet N Hot, but it still has quite a kick. It's not my favorite flavor, but I still give it 5 stars for the great texture and good flavor (and the fact that my kids devoured it). I bought this package with my kids in mind. I am all for natural products that they enjoy!

review/text: I have had this on order for about a total of 8 bags. I first had a good experience and what seemed like a quality jerky and continued to keep it ordered on my subscribe and save account. The next 2 bags were awful. There were tiny bits and they were extra hard and grisly. I thought maybe it was just a bad run and let the next order come through. They were terrible also. It was like there was one or two decent strips of meat, and the rest was inedible. I'm not sure how this keeps happening. I had meant to cancel this subscription but remembered after I was shipped another pack of two. Maybe they'll be better but I haven't been eager to to open them. Roll of the dice, I guess.

review/text: This is my second order of Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack from Amazon due to lower price than other stores and I hit the jackpot.  You can see the pictures I upload for this product.  It has mold all over, which even can be seen from outside the bag.  Unfortunately I did not see it and put one in my mouth.  Few seconds afterward, the taste was so strange and my friend, who was about to eat, stop me from swallowing.  Try for yourself, but please be careful.

review/summary: Great product but the subscription ships old products.
review/text: I love this beef jerky and so I looked everywhere for it, and had trouble finding it readily. So when I found this product on subscription on Amazon, I was more than thrilled to subscribe. That was two months ago. I've now cancelled my subscription. Why you ask? The unopened packages of the beef jerky were hard as a rock and were tasteless as a result. I don't know what Amazon does to receive the jerkys so cheap thereby giving the customers the 15% discount, but I'd rather pay more and get them off retail and enjoy every piece.. I am very disappointed at the result and won't re-subscribe again.

review/summary: MOLD on Jerky!!!
review/text: I bought eight packs. Seven of those, I hope, were in good condition. One of them looks darker and has mold on it. I didn't notice that after I ate two pieces... That was disgusting!! It says on the package the jerky will be good until 2013. I guess the company is wrong.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon CS. After 5 minute they decides to give me refund. This is probably all that Amazon can do, but I will not buy any kind of food/snacks on Amazon anymore. And I will not buy any Jack Links product on line or in store. Their quality control is really doubtable.<br /><br />MOLD ON JERKY!! Be aware!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SIY3O2">Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>This order took five days to deliver and this is Florida with high humidity and high heat. Upon receipt I opened each package because I always place in my fridge in gallon zip locks. I ordered two of the mega two-packs and three of the four were fine. The fourth was FULL of mold which was visible through the packaging. I am seriously disappointed (and grossed-out). No returns/exchanges means I will NEVER purchase foods items from Amazon again.<br /><br />Update: After figuring out a way to contact Customer Service despite their policy of no returns on food items, they credited back 1/4 of total purchase price and offered free next day shipping for this item (which I will not use). Never again.

review/text: Mostly, this was good stuff. I haven't had this stuff in a long long time but decided to purchase some.<br /><br />Most of the jerky was good, but I ran into 1 too many pieces that was fatty or felt like a salty chunk of fat. I wish I would've gotten pieces or a bag without any of it considering this is pretty damn expensive stuff, but it is good.<br /><br />They definitely need to work on quality control if they want to keep the prices so high for this stuff, or I might have to go to a different brand.

review/text: Me and the missus went through this pretty quick... It's sweet, peppery, tasty.<br /><br />This was enough to satisfy my craving for jerky for awhile... I think the sugar, salt, and MSG are the main turn-offs for me although I do realize some of this may be required for jerky.<br /><br />It's almost like I want either a more wholesome jerky snack or a straight-up rod of faux-meat.<br /><br />Still, this is worth checking out to see if it's your thing.

review/summary: Best ever
review/text: I buy a lot of stuff online and only write a review if something was very good or very bad.<br /><br />I honestly have to say that Jack Link's Jerky is the best jerky I have ever eaten (I've even bought some from a meat market before).  I have tried several of their flavors and all have been good.  The Sweet & Hot could be a little hotter, IMO, but it is still awesome and my favorite of theirs.  Besides the different flavors being good, what really sets Jack Link's apart from every other jerky I've tried is the quality of the meat itself.  The meat has the perfect amount of moisture, making it able to actually bite a piece in half without having to gnaw on it for 20 minutes.  While other brands aren't very consistent, particularly Pemmican, which I used to think was the best available, Jack Link's is very consistent with the quality of each piece.  Most brands usually have a mix of perfect pieces, dry pieces, and way too thick pieces.  Not Jack Link's, I've yet to get a dry piece, or one that was way too thick.<br /><br />The several people that I have "turned on to" Jack Link's would fully agree with me about this review.  We've actually spoke about how amazed we are with it.<br /><br />Walmart is the place that I first found it, and they are always out of stock of it.  So I turned to Amazon and was able to find it for roughly the same price when you factor in shipping.<br /><br />BTW, the package of ten 1.5 ounce bags is nice if you are like me and tend to just keep eating until it is gone.  :)  Also, each 1.5 ounce bag has about 25 grams of protein.  So if you are on a workout program, it makes a nice way to get extra 25 grams of protein with very little fat into your diet.

review/summary: By Far The Best Jack Links!
review/text: I love beef jerky, its perfect for work, packs tons of protein, easy to eat and store.  I have to say though the price of the stuff locally is insane, the 3oz bags go for up to 7 bucks a piece.<br /><br />This is the best deal I've found by far, select delivery 1 time a month for 16 bucks and sit back and wait for your jerky!<br /><br />Now on to the flavor, I usually buy the peppered Jack Links for the touch of spice.  Recently I found the A1 steak jerky, and its fantastic!  It seems like its more dry, like the homemade jerky I remember from my grandparents.  I find the most of the flavors to be to moist, and salty.<br /><br />If your a fan of jerky, and the taste of A1 sauce, you will enjoy this product, use amazons subscription option and save another 15%, excellent deal when compared to store purchasing.

Looked through package window, and what was left of my jerky could not even be identified as jerky.  It was white yet covered with mold.  Couldn't see any evidence of a hole in the packaging.  It came in a 2-pack, and the 2nd pack looks fine but has the same date stamp on it, so I'm not sure I dare eat it.  They expire in December of 2013...14 months away.  I'm not sure what happened to it, just that I wasted $10, and I'm still nauseous just thinking about the sight and smell of it.  Is jerky even supposed to spoil at all?
