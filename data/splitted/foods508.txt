review/summary: Mini pops - ingenious
review/text: My mother's favorite flavor is Chocolate, mine being Butterscotch. These lollypops are extremely delicious and they last for quite a while. The shape of the lollypops are unique and they are as savory as I can remember. I highly enjoy all products from Sees candies, the only downside is they can't ship you a sample chocolate like they give at the store!<br /><br />Quality products, quality service, quality through and through.<br /><br />These are great because you don't have to fiddle with the sticks, although it is a different experience entirely, it's one you won't want to pass!

I sometimes just eat them by themselves, icy cold from the fridge, and I also make<br />a fantastic fruit salad with pineapple and mandarin oranges, miniature marshmallows, mayonnaise and orange flavored yogurt. They come as close as possible to the wonderful fresh Rainier cherries that are only available about one month of the year at about $8 a pound.  And Oregon Fruit, produced in the USA, is as good as it gets!

review/summary: Bad condition of cans
review/text: I love the Oregon Royal Ann cherries.  However, when I received my shipment the cans were terribly dented.  Of the 8 cans in the shipment only 3 were in good condition.  The only reason I didn't send them back was that I really needed 2 of the cans for a special dish for Easter and I didn't have time to send them back and get another order.  I will continue to use the cherries but I doubt that I will order them again from Amazon.com unless I have plenty of time to send them back if they arrive in  the condition that they did this time.  The cans were not dented in shipment because the outside pkg. was in perfect condition.  They were already dented before they were shipped and that is why I was very upset with the order.  I was very surprised that Amazon would ship out a product in that bad a condition.  So, the product is great if you can get it without the cans looking like somebody dropped them on the floor or kicked them.

review/text: Looking forward to the replacement shipment from Amazon.  Every single can was dented.  The 8 cans were shrinkwrapped, and then packaged in a larger box with really big air packs (like giant bubbles from bubble wrap) around them.  Obviously, when they arrived, there was just some plastic...nothing to stop the cans from jumbling around in the box.  How someone would think that an air pack could cushion a 10+ pound set of cans without popping is beyond me.  Again, Amazon is sending replacements...hoping these aren't all dented :)

review/summary: A great summer drink: sweet, nutty and caffeine free
review/text: Treat yourself to an excellent summer tea. Caffeine free with a naturally sweet and nutty taste, the tea can be brewed hot or cold. If this is your first experience with Japanese mugicha (barley tea), the large tea packet is the most common way it is sold.<br /><br />Our sons, ages 8 and 7, like mugicha. We don't buy Kool-Aid or other powdered drink mixes that require added sugar. Our family of four consumes at least a pitcher of the tea every day in the summer, so one package lasts about one month.<br /><br />Last summer, we purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038KNYWU">Hasegawa Juhyo Mugicha</a> but it is currently unavailable at Amazon. It was good though, so I wrote a five-star review for that brand. The price was reasonable, less than $9.45 for 51 packs, or roughly 38 cents for a two-quart pitcher.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ATZOAQ">House Mugicha</a> is about the same price, a five-package order costs $15.94 through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program. Each pack contains 16 tea bags (each making one quart of tea), which comes out to 40 cents for a two-quart pitcher.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars.

review/summary: Barley tea, the perfect summer drink without calorie and caffeine!
review/text: Growing up in Japan, the major drink for summer was and still is cold barley tea. Unlike sweetened drink or soda, you won't get thirsty after drinking this refreshing tea! Roasted barley flavor doesn't interfere with any meals. You just drop one bag in cold water and leave it outside to make it like sun tea. Great way to quench your thirst during Summer (in our household, it's all year around), and it doesn't come with calorie or caffeine. Some prefer to drink this sweetened, and I sure did when I was a kid.

review/summary: Wonderful aroma, robust flavor!
review/text: This is just how I remember drinking barley tea for the first time in Shinjuku, Japan. This tea tastes just as great and brings back memories for me. It has a toasty nuttiness flavor, similar to dandelion tea but more light and refreshing. Says you can steep in cold water, but I enjoy it by putting one tea bag in my coffee maker and brewing it that way. Makes a wonderful morning coffee replacement. Individual tea bags are larger than normal, each making 1 qt of tea (equivalent to 4 cups or 2 water bottles). I drink lots of healthy tea (moringa, dandelion, green tea, white tea, oolong), and this one of my favorites!<br /><br />I only see one ingredient listed on the box: Barley. Manufactured by House Foods Corp in Tokyo, Japan.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/6/12: I've been brewing this tea at least twice a week. I find placing one tea bag into my coffemaker is so convenient for me as it is enough to fill a 10 cup carafe with strong flavor within minutes (not watered down and faster than cold steeping). For any left over hot tea, I let it cool down to room temperature and place it in the fridge for a refreshing drink anytime. My highest recommendation for this tea is using clean, great tasting water as it really makes a difference. Hope this helps.

review/summary: Healthy, tasty tea. Good sweet or unsweetened, hot or cold.
review/text: When we were kids, our mother always kept pitchers of barley tea in the fridge. Last year, I came across a box at an Asian grocery store and now can't imagine life without it. We live over 100 miles from the Asian store so are happy to have found it here on Amazon.com ... and hope they stop carrying it!<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Flavor - Don't use more water than instructed for each teabag. It's got a subtle, nutty flavor.<br />* Caffeine-free. One cup of tea or coffee can keep me awake all night, so this keeps me from wrecking my sleep schedule.<br />* Lots of health benefits (I won't go into it here, but you can Google for info.)<br />* Good hot or cold. In winter, we keep a pot on the stove and drink it all day. In summer, it's great refrigerated.<br />* Sweetened or unsweetened. You can make this tea appealing to kids by sweetening; we use a mixture of brown sugar and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00445K4JY">Splenda No-Calorie Sweetener with Fiber</a>.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can't think of any!<br /><br />We'll be needing to move up our next Subscribe & Save shipment!

review/text: I picked up a box of the blueberry treats while vacationing in DC as a treat for the dogs. I loved the tiny size because we're doing a lot of training at the moment and the dogs were putting on weight (two toy poodles and a Lab#. Who knew that all three would be crazy for the blueberry treats - all three run to the cookie dish and sit patiently until they get a couple of blueberry bones #they are small treats which allows me to give two or three treats instead of breaking one into pieces). Even the Lab, who has had weight issues for years, loves these treats. Who knew dogs liked blueberries!

review/summary: Some liked them, some ignored them
review/text: My 6 Greyhounds received the chicken pot pie flavored treats as an early Easter surprise from their Auntie. Keeping in mind the size of my dogs, these treats are the teeniest, tiniest things I think I've seen. Maybe an inch long and 1/8" high/deep, the dogs' canine teeth are bigger than these treats. Keeping in mind a treat this small will most likely be swallowed whole, I distributed them slowly to each pup. It was as if they were gulping air...I don't think the ones with enough teeth to chew even tasted them. The 2 with minimum teeth for whom I must moosh everything up got theirs crushed up in yogurt...those two girls wouldn't eat the yogurt. So, I can't tell if my pups like these or not; most didn't even taste them as they went down the hatch too quickly without chewing; the other two didn't like what they did to their favorite treat since losing their teeth, yogurt.<br /><br />They are wheat and corn free, listed as 100% natural and the ingredients list on the back of the little box are:<br />oat flour, rolled oats, potato flour, chicken broth, carrots, celery, canola oil, eggs, baking powder<br /><br />For the price, one can put those ingredients together at home (I will swap potato flour for whole wheat flour) and bake them yourself. Even if it takes a few tries to get the measurements right, the dogs will still eat them and you can make them any size that is appropriate for your pet(s). If baking them as hard treats is too time consuming for you, do what I do: mix it up like a meatloaf, bake it, cut into appropriately sized treat pieces, and keep in the frig. Easy enough and one can use leftovers from a meal rather than start with all new ingredients. Probably healthier for your pet too.<br /><br />However, we must still thank Auntie for allowing us to try something new. If it were not for the tiny size of these treats, they would most likely have been a great big hit here.

review/summary: Delicious with some Tweaking!
review/text: This hot chocolate is delicious with some tweaking. I originally bought it because I cannot find hot chocolate in the store that does not contain any hydrogenated oils or a ton of sugar. Nestle is the only one who doesn't in their fat-free mix, but then you have the nasty artificial sweetners to deal with. I was ecstatic when I came across this (hopefully a dream come true) on Amazon and ordered it.<br /><br />I have to admit, my first batch wasn't very good. I followed the directions, and found the hot chocolate to be very strong. I like more of a milky chocolatey taste as opposed to a dark chocolatey taste in my hot chocolate.<br /><br />I consume sugar very sparingly, so I used both liquid and powdered Stevia with this chocolate. It produced okay results, but nothing really spectacular. I love Dagoba chocolate bars, so was expecting to be "wowed" by the hot chocolate, too. I was a little disappointed when I wasn't.<br /><br />I was camping on my third try making this chocolate, and gave up on the Stevia. I made the batch with half of the chocolate called for, and the only other item I had on hand that was sweet (I don't carry sugar)  was a bottle of organic pure maple syrup. I added a teaspon ot two of this to my cup, and voila! It was a totally different experience.<br /><br />After only adding half of the chocolate called for, and using both Stevia and a little bit of pure maple syrup, was this chocolate exceptional.<br /><br />I was finally able to taste the true colors and depth of this delicious chocolate. It kind of reminded me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate because it has so much going on with it as far as the colors and depth go. Mexican chocolate is very flavorful, and this chocolate is too, with tweaking.<br /><br />Also, be sure to whisk the chocolate *very* well when heating up the milk (or other milk-type beverage) or you will end up with big clumps of unsweetened, unmelted chocolate in your cup. As it stands, when I whisk and whisk and whisk, I still get small clumps of chocolate in my cup.<br /><br />I rated this 4 stars because after tweaking, the choclate was delicious. If I hadn't had to tweak it, it would definitely get 5 stars. I would imagine if you just used sugar, you might not have the problems I had in the beginning.

review/summary: Not as good as it used to be
review/text: This is distinctly different than Gold Label Gran Riserva! While this is good balsamic vinegar, it is not great. We had previously purchased Fattoria Estense's Gran Riserva Gold Label and it was amazing. This vinegar is much sharper and thinner. It does not have the thick sweet quality of the Gran Riserva. The Gran Riserva you could easily serve on ice cream - this, no.<br />According to one of the vendors, all that was changed was the label.  They told me that "the year denotation of '12 years' had to be taken off of the bottle" and "the label had to be changed because of Italian government regulation." The vendor and Fattoria Estense are saying the new Gold Label 'Invecchiato Aged' is exactly the same balsamico, but IMHO it sure doesn't taste the same. I wouldn't buy it again - not at this price!

review/text: JACOBS CRONAT GOLD INSTANT COFFEE makes an excellent cup of coffee!<br />ESPECIALLY if one likes a MILD cup of coffee.  Although the package<br />directions suggest NOT to boil the water, but to pour it just below<br />boiling, I have tried it both ways -- and find that, like other<br />instants, JACOBS CRONAT GOLD INSTANT COFFEE suits my own tastes bet-<br />ter, if the water is boiled a LONGER time...the longer, the better!<br /><br />Tastes do differ -- and I find I, myself, like a deeper, more robust<br />brew.  However, if the water for this instant coffee is boiled LONG<br />enough, I find that a wonderful hint of strength is brought forth<br />amongst the mild taste, giving it a unique and delightful flavour,<br />which I have found, so far, in NO other instant coffee!<br /><br />  COFFEE....INSTANT....COFFEE<br /><br />The jar this coffee comes in is pleasing indeed!  Made of VERY heavy<br />glass,, I found that, (ordering four at a time to save on postage),<br />that the unopened package could easily be used as a doorstop!  The<br />"crown"-like cover is easy to open -- in a seemingly-circular, (but<br />actually fifteen-sided figure), design. Those 15 sides make it VERY<br />easy to open!<br /><br />On the two sides of the golden label, are printed directions for<br />use -- in NINE languages!  I can read the English, (UK) directions,<br />and recognize, (I think), the lettering for the Russian, (MK) -- or<br />is it Greek -- directions, though I cannot read them.  The other<br />directions -- for "AL"; "HR/BiH"; "SRB..(Serbia?) / MNE"; and "SI",<br />are in languages I do not know.  It's fascinating to look at this<br />label, however -- because it confirms my suspicions that Americans<br />are woefully under-educated, as I, (who was educated in District 26<br />in Queens, New York -- reputedly one of the best public school<br />districts in New York City, and in Queens College of the City of<br />New York, (which also has a sterling reputation), could recognize<br />but two of these languages!  I also noted -- with some alarm -- that<br />FRENCH does NOT seem to be one of the nine languages used for these<br />directions!  Maybe it IS there, and I have had too many years pass<br />between college French classes and now....but if it ISN'T there, the<br />manufacturers of this coffee are MISSING a market which will NOT<br />accept ANY merchandise of ANY kind, without FRENCH instructions<br />being given on the packaging: QUEBEC, CANADA!  (This includes EVERY<br />imaginable  product: in the infamous "Matzo-gate" of several years<br />back, the government of Quebec would not even allow Matzo to be<br />imported into Quebec, for Jews celebrating Passover, because there<br />was NO FRENCH LETTERING on the boxes!)  This is all the more aston-<br />ishing to me, as it seems that the JACOBS Coffee Company has now<br />become a subsidiary of the KRAFT FOODS CORPORATION (!) -- a very<br />large food company, which should be aware of the Quebec law!  (Or<br />perhaps they are just too busy producing yummy food to have re-<br />membered this?)  Anyway, I happen to have relatives in Quebec --<br />so I KNOW this Quebec law -- of having FRENCH language directions<br />included on EVERYTHING, is true.  So, if KRAFT, and JACOBS, want<br />to sell this coffee to the Quebec, Canada market, I respectfully<br />request they include FRENCH directions on the packaging!<br /><br />Altogether, this is a delicious instant coffee -- especially if<br />you like MILD instant coffee.  The thick glass and 15-sided top,<br />bespeak quality, and the labeling, in 9 languages, is like a<br />mini-miniscule armchair trip to Europe, for curious Americans!

review/summary: Instant Chai Tea
review/text: While you can make your own chai tea, it does take some work to gather all the spices and then steep them in milk. The Oregon Chai tea mixes are rather easy to use. You can either make regular tea and add the packet like you would milk and spices or you can serve this with hot milk or even just water.<br /><br />If you are looking for a very creamy version, you can make a 16-ounce cup of hot water in the microwave and then add one packet of Oregon Chai Tea Mix, 1 packet of hot chocolate and 2 Constant Comment tea bags. That is my favorite combination so far.<br /><br />While the tea packets are for an 8-ounce cup, I make a much larger cup of tea, so this is perfect to mix with a tea bag and more powdered milk.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, dried whole milk, dried nonfat milk, natural flavors, dried honey, tapioca maltodextrin, decaffeinated dried black tea and salt. Yes, salt!<br /><br />Each packet is 100 calories.<br /><br />Also look for Ready-to-drink individual servings and liquid concentrates where you just add milk.<br /><br />If you are just using a packet of this mix and 8 ounces of water, you might still want to add some powdered milk to make it extra creamy. Whipped cream and nutmeg also make the drink more delicious.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: An Essential Ingredient in the Perfect Pie!
review/text: Oregon fruit pitted red tart cherries in water are the best pie and dessert cherries I've found.  They are not available in stores where I live.  Ordering them online via Amazon is great.  These cherries are the beginnings of the perfect pie.  Creativity is your only limitation.<br /><br />It's easy to make a delicious pie from scratch.  First, make enough pie crust dough for a two-crust pie.  (Never buy a pie crust when you can make a better tasting one at home).<br /><br />Place the bottom crust into a deep pie pan and crimp the edges.  Next open a can of Oregon Fruit Pitted Red Tart Cherries in water and drain the water.  Put contents into a large mixing bowl.  Now let your imagination run wild!  Add a can of Oregon Raspberries, and perhaps a half a can of Oregon Blueberries, both drained, as I did yesterday, or almost any variety of Oregon berries that you can get your hands on.<br /><br />Add about 1/2 cup of sugar & 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to the berry mixture and stir it all up.  Place into the pie pan and cover with the top pie crust.  Make steam slits into the top crust, and dab with milk or butter, and then sprinkle sugar atop.  Bake at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes to an hour.  That's it!<br /><br />The end result is a delicious pie that tastes better than anything you can buy in a store or bakery, and has much less sugar.  You can, of course, add more sugar to the berry mixture if you like, but I like the cherries to taste tart.<br /><br />So go ahead and make a pie!

review/text: Cherry pie made with Oregon red tart cherries has become a tradition in our house.  This Thanksgiving, I went to our Vons, and they no longer carried them.  I checked out the internet, and discovered I could order them from Amazon.  I ordered them, and they arrived on Monday before Thanksgiving, in plenty of time to make the pies.

review/summary: Grandma's pies revisited
review/text: I have never purchased food off the internet for my family's personal consumption before.  The only reason I went looking on Amazon was to find a store near me that sold Oregon Red Tart Cherries.  I've long forgotten about making cherry pies like my grandmothers because I refuse to use pie filling.  I was stunned to discover that not only could I purchase them online for a nice price, but free shipping brought them right to my door.  Thanksgiving was especially memorable this year because of the 3 cherry pies I made - it was nostalgia all the way!

review/summary: Oregon Pitted Red Tart Cherries in Water
review/text: I was overjoyed to locate these, since I love to bake with cherries!  I had read that tart cherries are in very short supply, this season.  Since most people prefer to purchase ready-made pie filling (which I detest, since these products are far too sweet), most supermarkets no longer stock plain tart cherries (even in plentiful growing seasons)!  For those of you who've never made cherry-topped cheesecake from scratch, I recommend that you do so--go easier with the sugar than is typical with most cherry pie filling/topping recipes made from scratch.  Properly made topping should taste LESS SWEET than the cheesecake it glorifies!

review/text: Excellent product. The cherries are firm, delicious and fresh. I like that they are in water and not a sugary syrup that would make them taste artificial. I used them in pies of course, and in an ice cream dessert for Christmas. I will continue to order from this company. I highly recommend this product and expect that the quality of their other products will be just as excellent.

review/text: I am so glad Oregon teamed up with Amazon to carry these. The grocery stores in my area have stopped carrying them and my pies don't taste the same with the store brand. I used to think it wouldn't matter, but they do make a big difference. The cherry taste is just the best - the store variety is just bland. Everyone loves my pies and I think a good part of that is the Oregon cherries. Thank you Amazon for carrying these!!!

review/text: Recently while at the home of a friend who was serving his delicious cherry pie, he lamented the fact that the price of canned tart cherries was so high that he would probably not be making this treat again. My husband suggested we check the internet for that product. Little did I imagine that through Amazon we'd be able to buy Oregon Red Tart cherries for a price substantially lower than our friend had from the local food store...and I"m not even sure they were the same wonderful brand. These cherries are absolutely delicious! We will be bringing several cans to our friend so he can keep up his great pie-making effort and celebrate Washington's Birthday with some good reasonably priced cans of cherries. A great buy!

review/summary: How can one confuse Gooseberries for Red Tart Cherries?
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6625I">Oregon Fruit Pitted Red Tart Cherries in Water, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 8)</a><br />Red Tart Cherries are hard to find in the grocery store, so I was thrilled when I saw them for sale on Amazon. I ordered 2 packages. But, I received 1 package of Red Tart Cherries and, like another reviewer, the second package was a package of Gooseberries. Plus, each and every can of the Cherries was dented badly. So I could not use anything from this order. I must say that Amazon was wonderful with this issue and gave me a refund with no hassle. This is my first problem with an order from Amazon after many years of service. So for that I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 star.

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: Based on the reviews, I had high hopes for making a great cherry pie using these cherries. Sour cherries are hard to come by where I live.  However, I was very disappointed.  The cherries are a light, pinkish color and are bland and tasteless. I followed the recipe directions inside the label for cherry pie filling, but it still came out a little watery.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think I'll try making cherry pie again unless I can get my hands on some fresh cherries.

review/summary: my dog loves these vitamins!!
review/text: My dog was having feeding issues---for some reason, he wasn't willing to eat so I took him to my vet and we were able to figure it out and get his appetite back.  In the meantime, he recommended the 3 green dog multivitamins, which was formulated by a vet and a nutritionist and contained vitamins and supplements, which he thought Lightning needed since he'd basically wouldn't eat for weeks now.  I was hesitant to try it as it is quite hard to give my dog any "medicine," and I figured if the vitamins were anything like human vitamins, it was going to taste nasty and it was a fight I did not want to battle.  To my surprise, when I opened the bottle, it smelled like peanut butter, which my dog LOVES.  Awesome start.  I gave it to Lightning and lo and behold, he loved it!!  And wanted more!  I was so happy that I had to hold myself back from giving him more than 1 a day.  He loves it more than some of the "treats" we give him when he's been good.  I love it because I'm never sure he's getting enough nutrition from the dog food and the supplements (alfalfa, spirulina, etc) sound like the stuff we would want for ourselves but wouldn't know how much to give to our pets.  Since this multivitamin is made by a vet AND a nutritionist and this brand was recommended by my vet (who is AMAZING), I feel completely at ease giving this to Lightning every day.  He's always been energetic and that hasn't changed but I have noticed that his hair is shinier and he loves the taste. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Great food storage item
review/text: If you live in any area prone to disaster, this can be a life saver.  If you're without power for a few weeks in an ice storm and you can't get to the grocery store, what's in your freezer won't help you.  If you can boil water for some egg noodles, throw this on top, and you have an easy poor-man's beef stroganoff (too bad you can't get canned sour cream, though).  As others have said, it is also good over rice or mixed with a can of mixed vegetables and canned potatoes for a quick stew.<br /><br />Of course it's not as good as home cooked fresh roast beef.  But I'll bet it would be as good as home canned roast beef if you canned it at home. (Edited based on comment.)<br /><br />If you want something for the occasional quick and easy meal and the comfort of knowing you have something you can eat in a disaster, I think you'll like this.

review/summary: The Product Has Changed Over The Years
review/text: In the past a can of roast beef was really filled with roast beef; one had to pry it out with a fork. This product seems to be a minimal amount of roast beef and a maximal amount of brown gravy. As a point of curiosity I called Hormel and asked them about the small amount of beef and the large amount of gravy and was told that may have been the end of a production run and was short on beef.<br /><br />They sent me a coupon for a free can so I got the can and checked it out and found it was the same as before. There is some beef in there and it can taste good on rice or potatoes but just be prepared for the large amount of brown gravy.<br /><br />The taste is reasonably satisfying, especially if it is loaded up with pepper. It will probably take more than one can for a family meal.<br /><br />I agree with one reviewer that it is a workable alternative for emergency use and can be eaten without cooking; it also has a good shelf life so that helps out.

review/text: I was surprised to find this a very decent and good tasting (for canned) roast beef.  Pretty much like what you get at the local diner.  My son liked it as well.  We had it with rice and it made a good meal.  It's good over bread and in the usual ways.  Decent amount of flavor.  One can will barely feed two hungry men, though. ;)<br /><br />Lots of gravy with meat pieces, a bit more meat would be nice. The meat was fairly lean and tender and had good texture.  The taste was good and for a quick meal, this is very handy.<br /><br />I also tried the Libby's brand, which was OK, but this tasted better to me.

review/summary: Here's the beef!
review/text: After many disappointing experiences with canned meat, I was very pleasantly surprised by this product. Not only does it look like the picture on the can, it tastes delicious and is all natural. There are absolutely no preservatives or artificial colors in here. It's just beef, spices, and gravy (flour, starch). You can eat it right out of the can, but you really ought to heat it up first because it looks like goop otherwise. The juice congeals into a starchy paste that is not very appetizing to look at or eat. Heated for a minute in the microwave, it melts back into a delicious brown gravy.<br /><br />The meat pieces aren't mushy like you might expect. They retain a good chewy texture. Over steamed rice, egg noodles, or vegetables, this makes a perfect and quick meal. It's not that bad nutritionally either. One can is 340 calories (120 from fat), 48 g of protein, and 50% of your daily iron intake. Sodium is a bit high at 60% of your USRDA, but comparable or lower than other canned meat products.<br /><br />The beef tastes like beef and this is certainly one of the most delicious canned meats I've ever eaten. The only thing to consider is that this beef is produced in Brazil, whose cattle industry has the unfortunate controversy of cutting down rain forests to provide grazing territory.

review/text: As always homemade is better but the Hormel Roast Beef & Gravy makes a nice alternative. Inside the can you will find nicely sized tender chunks of beef with tasty gravy. This makes a perfect light lunch or dinner for two. I like to serve the Hormel beef and gravy over bread or mashed potatoes. Egg noodles are good too. For the best flavor I do season it up a bit with a good shake of salt and pepper.<br /><br />Recommend.

review/summary: DENTED CAN ALERT
review/text: I just ordered a case of these and was horrified to see HUGE dents in all 6 cans. It looks as though someone banged the side of each can with a hammer.  The shipping box, however, was in perfect shape.  Hmmm...<br /><br />What a waste of my time and money.  From now on, I'm going to buy my canned food at the local grocery store.

review/summary: Packaging Problems
review/text: The product is great for a quick dinner over rice. However, two of my six cans arrived so badly dented that I could not use them.

review/summary: Dents!
review/text: Ordered 12 cans, exp date is December of 2012. 9 of the 12 have dents, mild to severe. Package was not damaged, so they were dented before they shipped. Debating whether to return them. Love this over mashed taters!

review/summary: Great for fast but tasty meal
review/text: Just opened my first can for dinner last night. The gravy is very tasty without being overly salty. Meat was tender and tasty as well. Excellent emergency/camping/long term storage food. It heats easily and can be combined to make many dishes. I had the traditional roast beef and potatoes last night, but already have plans to make a nice roast beef sandwich with melted cheese and onions soon.<br /><br />Thumbs up on this one!

review/summary: Definitely Canned Food, But Not Bad Considering
review/text: There's no getting around the fact that this is canned meat and gravy, and so take that into account.  It's going to have a bit of canned flavor, smell and texture -- not like Grandma's homemade pot roast.<br /><br />But considering that, this is a convenient and pretty well done product for a canned food.  There is a good balance of roast beef chunks to gravy.  I would say you definitely get two servings per can and, depending on use, three or even four servings.  (I can't remember what the can claims as number of servings but I think it was two per can.)  A hungry person or big eater might want to consume the entire can.<br /><br />This isn't a product where you'd buy it just for the roast beef, draining off the liquid; this is intended to include the gravy as part of the overall dish.  That makes it convenient for things like topping a baked potato, mashed potatoes, grits, toast, rice, pasta, or whatever you like.  But it's specific in that sense.  If you need canned beef for other purposes, you will want to buy another different product.<br /><br />The roast beef is tender and tastes good.  I haven't encountered any fat or grisly bits.  The beef chunks tend to be around 1/2" to 1", roughly, and most of them are pretty consistent in size.  The gravy, while slightly "canned" for my taste, is still okay.  The product is not overly salted, which is a big plus.<br /><br />Besides the obvious uses, you could use this as simply beef gravy if you wanted, by breaking up the chunks into smaller bits.  The chunks flake into bits easily.  That might be good if you are feeding to young children and don't want to worry about them gacking on a big piece of meat.  But it also means that you could use this as a casserole sauce or binder for mixing up rice dishes etc.

review/summary: Tastes way, way too good for me to ever reorder it again
review/text: I ate all 6 cans within the first 48 hours.  At that rate, I would become the fattest man on Earth in a short time.  In addition to good taste, this product has other advantages:  (1)This beef is prepared in a way that there are no cancer-causing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, no cancer-causing heterocyclic amines, almost no increase in the amount of cancer-causing dietary advanced glycation endproducts (dAGEs), and this beef contains only a minimal amount of cancer-causing nitrosamines, which are always present in salt.  (2)This beef is very soft - even softer than corned beef.  (3)There are no bones or arteries.

review/summary: Good beef & gravy without the mess.
review/text: I usually have a couple of cans of this in my cupboard. I enjoy this on noodles, with potatoes, also makes good hot beef sandwiches with mashed potatoes & pour the gravy over all. There isn't a lot of beef like there was years ago, more gravy these days. But it's still good.
