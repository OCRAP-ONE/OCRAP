review/text: Tried the BBQ Popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors. Loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which weren't that great. Good healthy snack without giving up the taste. So glad I discovered these! Salt and vinegar are my favorite! 100 cal/bag, 3.5g fat/bag

review/summary: Soo GOOD!
review/text: Cheetos ever since I was kid were one of my favorite snacks,I mean who wouldn't like them? You can't go wrong with the original but decided to give this one a try. I'm not a fan of unbearably hot foods but I do like things with with a kick and since this had Jalapeno in it I was assuming it was hot...not so much. If you eat mildly hot foods this shouldn't bother you at all and definitely not if you like hot kind of food. I didn't even find them hot just have a unique kick of cheddery Jalapeno flavor. I would recommend to buy these at your local store if they carry them because this price on here is just insane, i buy mine for a little over 3 dollars for this bag. Overall I hope they decide to keep this one, cause they are amazing. And yes girls like these kind of snacks too :)! Love!

review/summary: Too good to continue for long.
review/text: For you spicy lovers, these jalape&ntilde;o Cheetos are for you. The taste is great and I admit I did not expect them to be this good. One day I picked up a small bag at the corner store and by the end of the week I had about 4 empty bags in my Trash cans. Office snack a must! Unfortunately this product is too good to last and I fear it will meet the same fate as Wasabi Funyuns. Rarely does a spicy type of chip that actually tastes awesome become part of the standard sale roster. So enjoy these Awesome Jalape&ntilde;o Cheetos for as long as they last.

review/summary: Found the solution on how to open it
review/text: I bought this because I had been seeing this pod in magazines and other places. I thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro. However, this is very poorly designed. I could not open it whats-or-ever, even after searching through reviews after reviews. Finally, my genius boyfriend found the solution! Basically, you will need to open it from the BOTTOM. You will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it. You will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there's water in the pot. If any one who is reading this still having problem opening it. Let me know. I'll try to explain it better there. But anyway, this is a pretty useless product for its productivity, but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own, and wants a prettier fridge. You can make you own with a cup (or any container) filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb....(so unless you have money to waste, don't buy this useless pot).

review/text: I have had the herb pods for about 6 months.  They are a great concept, but have a poor design. The plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on.  I'm  constantly afraid that I'm going to break it.  The pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water.  Unfortunately I don't use them half of the time I buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth.

review/summary: Too small, too hard to open
review/text: With no clear instructions on how to open and close the unit, the first few times are an act of frustration.  When I finally realized that if I grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield, about one third from it's bottom and squeeze the sides, the bottom lip pops out nicely.<br />I will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley, basil ect.  The company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly.<br />All in all I like it, I took away one star for the lack of instructions.<br /><br />3/2012: After a few months I have thrown this thing away.  It became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs I use most.  I have seen some newer, larger units that don't have the issue with opening it like this one has...I'm going to order one of these.<br /><br />I no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to 2 stars.

review/text: Despite reading the reviews of others on how hard this was to open, I was confident I knew the secret so would be fine. Not so. No matter what I did, couldn't pop off the clear plastic lid. Instructions showed the bottom part screwing off, didn't. Husband couldn't even do it and he opens everything for me. He finally got it open, only held about half of the aspargus which is what I wanted it for so tossed it in the garbage and then bought one from Progresso that we both can open. Note to self, pay MORE attention to what people are saying.

review/summary: Great idea, such a pain to open and close
review/text: The reviews on this are so true. Great idea, but such a pain to pop the clear lid off from the side, even once I figured it out. I keep waiting for it to break in my hands because it does take some pressure to pop off the lid - but it feels fragile and likely to break with too much pressure. I would consider buying one of the new designs that seem sturdier and open from the top (not the side).

review/summary: Save your money!
review/text: I rarely write reviews, but these pods are so awful, I was hoping to save even one person from wasting their money like I did.  The little green plug barely stays in -- even after twisting it -- so the water is always sloshing out.  And the clear plastic cover is absolutely the worst design.  It is nearly impossible to remove and actually snapped into shards when I tried to open one of the pods.  (And I can attest that those plastic shards are sharp!)  If you are able to actually open the pod, be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom.  Even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs (which they don't really do), they would not be worth the aggravation or cost.  Like another reviewer said, just put your herbs in a cup with a little water in the bottom and a plastic bag covering the top.  Works perfectly and costs nothing.  Please don't waste your money on this!

review/summary: keeps herbs fresh, looks nice--awkward to use
review/text: I've had a couple of these for a few years but find that I don't use them all that often because their size & design limits their usefulness. For bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch, and it's difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on. Since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it. It works great for asparagus, but only for small-ish bunches and if the spears aren't too tall.<br /><br />More often than not I simply use a canning jar + 1/2" of water with a plastic bag over the top, which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access. These pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bag-topped-jar, however, and the clear front makes it harder to forget what's in there.<br /><br />They are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over. And the little drain port is fun to use.<br /><br />But it only works for small bunches.

review/summary: Would be a great product....if it was easier to open
review/text: I got one of these for XMAS...and to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive container.<br /><br />The main problem is the container is difficult to open. It does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go.<br /><br />The thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it (you don't need to open the bottom....just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out FIRMLY). Don't worry...you won't break it. It is pretty sturdy plastic.<br /><br />The real issue is when it is filled or has water in it...its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling.<br /><br />I've just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill port....then popping it.<br /><br />PREPARA...please read these reviews and improve on the next design!!!

review/text: Even with the tips shared on how to open it, it's still pretty difficult to open.  I guess I have weak hands. My husband usually has to open it for me, and even he doesn't do it with ease.  I would recommend getting the larger Prepara herb savor instead of the pod.  It's much easier to open and can hold more.  I could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod (considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and I only use half).

review/summary: Sorry Oprah, not one of my 'favorite things'
review/text: Saw this on Oprah's favorite things and thought it would make a great little Christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as I do. Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem. I think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrapping/tape on music CDs! I've gone back to my old method...a wide-mouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabric...it works!

review/summary: Wilted hopes
review/text: I wanted very much to like this product, but after using it for more than 9 months, I just can't. The clear plastic cover is very difficult to get off, especially when the pod is filled with water. It's also difficult to get the cover on, especially when you're trying to store bushy herbs like parsley or cilantro. The o-ring that is supposed to seal the bottom of the pod doesn't seem to seat correctly. After removing the bottom of the pod to clean out dirt left behind from some rooted herbs, I've never again been able to get it to be water-tight. Consequently, every time I use my pod,I have to store it in a bowl or else I'm mopping up water from my fridge shelf. On the plus side, the leaky bottom helps to remind me to change the water every day!

review/summary: just works
review/text: My wife bought me this for storing fresh herbs and despite initial skepticism I gave it a try. It seemed to work well enough for basil, even freshening up some wilted leaves... but the "seal the deal" moment was when I put some fresh thyme in it and put it in the back of my refrigerator where I mostly forgot about it. 6 weeks later (we were gone for 2 weeks on vacation) I opened it and the thyme was as fresh as the day it was cut. I doubt it would sustain all greens for this long but the fact that it kept thyme fresh for over a month longer than a plastic bag in the produce drawer would have made this an easy $10 to justify.<br /><br />It's always a nice surprise when a kitchen gadget delivers the goods.

review/text: I got this in my Christmas stocking from my stepfather.  We're both foodies, and try to cook like chefs in our homes.  I love this product.  I use this one for scallions/green onions which until recently always went bad before I could use all of them.  Sometimes I threw out more than 5, most times 2 or 3, but I honestly cannot remember the last time I used every single one.  That is, until now.  Inside the savor pod, they grow and keep for weeks (easily more than 3).  I am planning on buying the set of mini savor pods so I can actually use them for fresh herbs - storing my herbs in the same container as my onions is not a good idea.  The only drawback with this product is that the clear plastic cover is a little tricky to remove as others have mentioned, but wrestling with it is OK with me so long as I can use all my product before it goes bad.

review/summary: Not Safe!
review/text: After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!

review/summary: Organic Fruit Review
review/text: This fruit would be fine if it were not for the soft slimey textured watermelon and some other fruit that is in this can that is just slimey and icky. There are certain fruit that shouldn't be canned, and otherwise the crunchy pieces are fine. Much of the soft fruit I had to discard. Albeit, this item is good frozen and added to other fruit to make smoothie's then you don't have to taste the slime.

review/summary: Okay but some weird flavors
review/text: EDIT:  I just noticed each bag is only 1.76 pounds, not 2.2.  My review is not 2 stars instead of three.<br /><br />First off, as you can probably guess by the pictures, these are sour gummies.  That isn't said in the description.  Also, each one is about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide.<br /><br />Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.<br /><br />I could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews/niece.  After all, they will eat anything sugar coated right?

review/text: I've tried a few different 'Dirty Martini' mix's, etc. but I prefer the actual juice from the olive jar. Well, as any experienced dirty martini drinker knows; you soon have way too many olives and not enough juice. Boscoli Family Dirty Martini Olive Juice is the real thing. I usually buy 4 of the 25oz. bottles and that'll last me several months. Shipping is pricey but the bottles come not only packed in peanuts but also bubble wrapped. They pack 'em in a sturdy cardboard box and tape it up real well. I live in a rural area and usually get my order in about 4 days. Fantastic experience all the way around.

review/text: Sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill. This is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti-caking agent into your food, and no iodide. The anti-caking agent isn't event that effective, so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit. Stay away!

review/summary: Great taste, less sodium
review/text: The flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we're all accustomed to, although describing such subtleties is difficult.<br /><br />One noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt - 330mg per 1/4 teaspoon, versus 590mg per 1/4 teaspoon of conventional table salt.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is NOT iodized.  As our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine, it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet.

I was looking for a sampler pack to so my roommate and I could try the flavors as well as get some of the regular stuff.  I don't drink decaf, so I knew that some of this pack would not be used.  I figured that the rest of the cups would make up for the loss on the decaf.  I was wrong.  This "Sampler" pack was a joke.  18 of the cups were decaf, and 15 of them were the standard house brew.  I got 1 cup of Chocolate Glazed Donut and 1 cup of Cinnamon Roll.  Now, I will not be using most of the K-cups in this package because it was, again, MOSTLY DECAF!!!!!  This is what they consider a sample pack:<br /><br />8 Donut House Regular<br />9 Donut House Decaf<br />7 Donut Shop Regular<br />9 Donut Shop Decaf<br />1 Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut<br />1 Donut House Cinnamon Roll<br /><br />Some sample.....

review/summary: Teeny, Tiny Little Treats, But Good For What They Are, A Healthy Reward For Following Commands
review/text: We'll see how these work out in our family over time. I'm not sure that I am disciplined enough to make good use of them, although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog. They appear to be good for what they are, a very tiny, but healthy, reward. Right now I can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands, a training tool. I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.<br /><br />My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his "treat", looked at it as if to say, "You've GOT to be KIDDING!" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.<br /><br />I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.<br /><br />They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.<br /><br />I like the fact that these are low-fat, with no added salt, no refined sugar, no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. It says, "Treats Baked With Natural Peanut Butter."

I cannot for certain pin it on these treats but it's something to keep in mind if you are using them and your pet seems a little off kilter.

But these little guys, watch out.  It might SEEM like a 12 pack is a lot, but hold on to your seat when you put the very first one onto your vestal tongue.  A 12 pack will seem like there's a shortage of caramels in the world. LOL.<br /><br />I tried to come up with a way to explain the most awesome flavor in the world and I just can't.  To me it's like eating anything and everything in the world you ate that made you feel like "Ahhh, that's it."<br /><br />I can only hope that the gubment doesn't put a tax on it like cigs because then I'd have to put myself into an institution.

review/summary: Mmmmmmm....Sooo good!!!
review/text: I am a BzzAgent and I recently received a package of these to try.  I have to say that I absolutely LOVE the flavor of these candies.  I am usually not a big candy eater, but I have to say that I was really impressed.  The Werther's Chewy Caramels were so richly flavored and chewy that I couldn't stop at just one (I usually stop at one for most other candies).  They have a great buttery flavor that makes my mouth water just thinking about them.  I like the fact that they have some great ingredients, like cream and butter, but I had to deduct one star for the fact that there are artificial flavors in them (I am an avid label reader and try to stay away from any artificial ingredients).  As far as the taste goes, my kids and my husband were constantly in the pantry looking to grab another candy, so I can confidently say these were a huge hit in our family.  It was also a great incentive for the kids to eat their vegetables at dinner- they certainly cleaned their plate to have a couple of caramels for dessert.  If you are having a party, these would be great set out in a candy dish.  There will be none left by the end!

review/text: I reviewed Werther's original chewy caramels, caramel chocolates, and creamy filled<br />hard caramels as a BzzAgent and found the chewy caramels came a close second to the<br />original hard candies.  Still has that great unique caramel flavor from Werther's but<br />now in a chewable form.  I prefer the original hard candy as those little gems last<br />a little longer but these are a nice second choice.

review/summary: Good taste, way too hard.
review/text: If you like Werther's hard candies, you may like these. The pretty good caramels. But they are hard, and really sticky. Like "do I have all my fillings?" sticky.<br /><br />Eating a bag now. But I wanted caramels, and these really aren't. The are closely related, but so different, in terms of texture.<br /><br />Not my cup of tea. If you like your caramels really hard (not hard candy hard, but still), you may love these. If you think caramels should be soft and chewy, you may not.<br /><br />Now, I just tried warming them up, and that really helped. Almost tempted to raise it up to 4 stars. Don't microwave it though. That turns them into a bubbling mass of goo!

review/text: I have to laugh at the reviews that said it was too much work.  So you have to add an egg & a little butter!  It is well worth it.  I am not a cook at all and these come out perfect everytime.  They are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. My family loves, loves them.  The only thing different I do is instead of the extra 2 tbsp of water they call for, I add 2 tbsp of vanilla in place of. Best waffle mix!!

review/summary: Excellent Fluffy Pancakes.....
review/text: I had read some favorable reviews of this pancake mix on Amazon quite a while ago.  I had never ordered any, but I came across a can of it in one of those outdoor,camping stores last Christmas.  I have been using it ever since to make my dieting harder, and can honestly say I have never enjoyed the struggle so much.  Pancake mixes are usually one of those things that usually I buy the cheapest I can find, or at least one that I am familiar with.  I tend to balk at higher priced mixes for the most part. But every now and then I get curious of a brand like this one. It just so happens that when I visited this camping store, I was getting ready to take a short hike as soon as the holidays were over, and pancake mix has always been one of my staple items to take along.  Unfortunately it wasn't 'till I left that I realized that this mix was not one of the "just add water" ones that we all know and love.  The best ones always needed your own addition of eggs, milk, butter, etc, and this one is no exception in that respect.  So instead of enjoying this mix on the trail, I have been making pancakes in the wilds of my very own kitchen.  I really don't know what it is about this mix that makes it so good, but it does indeed make some of the best and most delicious pancakes I have ever tasted from a mix.  They are very light, fluffy, and flavorful, and well worth the price and ingredients that you have to add yourself.  If you have a pancake fiend in your home, I would highly suggest you buy some of this great mix. Its cheaper here on Amazon than I paid for it and well worth it in my opinion. I have had lots of different kinds over the years, and this makes some truly delicious pancakes.... Highly recommended...

review/summary: Good pancakes, lots of work
review/text: I love this pancake mix.  I bought my first can from Whole Foods Market about a year ago.  My only complaint is, for all the work you have to put into making them (at least the pancakes anyway) you could just as easily make pancakes from scratch.  You have to add your own egg, whole milk, and melted butter.  One thing I have noticed about this mix is that it's relatively difficult to burn the pancakes.  It is, however, easy to overcook them.

review/text: We use the Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix to make delicious Belgian Waffles in our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BXM2LU">Waring WMK300A Pro Professional Stainless-Steel Belgian Waffle Maker</a>. We have tried waffles using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BQPZGE">Krusteaz Waffle Mix Belgian 28-oz</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6BFE">Golden Malted All Natural Waffle & Pancake Mix, 33-Ounce Containers (Pack of 3)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB1UJA">Maple Grove Farms Waffle Mix Belgian, 24-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, and the waffle recipe from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JYTSY">Aunt Jemima Pancake Mix, 32-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. In a highly (un)scientific blind taste test involving my three children, the Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle mix was the unanimous choice.<br /><br />I make a triple batch according to the instructions--although i use only one tablespoon of melted butter instead of three--and the batter stores well in the fridge for up to four days. The triple batch makes 4 1/2 waffles on our waffle maker and they are crispy, light, and golden brown.<br /><br />This brand is slightly more expensive per waffle than the normal grocery store brands (like Krusteaz), but our family thinks the taste is worth it. As an aside, my son has a soy allergy and this mix is free of soy--unlike most other brands.

review/summary: Disappointed with my first farmhouse pancake
review/text: I used to buy Bob's Red Mill Organic 7 Grain Pancake & Waffle, Whole Grain Mix until I saw all these rave reviews about StoneWall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle mix. I decided to order from Amazon and tried it this morning.<br /><br />This pancake mix is very fine and powdery. When I made my pancake mix, the mix was all over my kitchen floor. The mix is almost foamy like when it is done mixing. The waffle recipe from the label asks for 2 Tbsp. of melted butter, which I never use that much when I use the Rob's Red Mill pancake mix. I could only make two perfect 7" round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be 3-4 pancakes. The pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review. However, I also tasted a lot of chemicals in it. I guess one reason it is so fluffy is a lot of baking soda in the ingredient. Looking at the ingredient label did I realize it has more chemicals than other brands. And I do not understand what ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR it has to be added in when this pancake mix is just the normal type with no fancy flavors like Cinnamon and Apple, etc.<br /><br />In short, I am going back to my Rob's Red Mill brand, at least I know what I am digesting in my stomach.

It was a good product at a fair price but now it is pricey.  All-in-all I would suggest that you order this at least once to taste what good pancakes are supposed to taste like.  After that I would suggest playing with recepies on your own.

review/summary: I'm a believer
review/text: I bought a Belgian waffle maker sort of on a whim and I was then confronted with the question: What waffle mix do I use? Somehow "Hungry Jack" felt like an afront to such a sublime kitchen appliance. I read the reviews here on Amazon and concluded that despite the rather high price, Stonewall would be a great choice. Bang! Nailed it the first time. Now, I don't know if my waffle maker is particularly large/deep, but I get only two and one half waffles out of each batch (following the recipe on the label). I don't dare water it down to try to stretch it out and I figure I only got about 10 batches of waffles out of one can. The cost-per-waffle is steep, but these have never failed to come out light on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside, and they have NEVER stuck to the waffle iron. Grudgingly, even though I see the price has gone up a dollar per can, I will be reordering, but if it goes up any higher, I may have to try another brand.

review/text: Bought a great waffle maker two years ago.  Tried many recipes for making waffles, nothing really pleased the family. Well, until I followed a recommendation to try Stonewall Waffles.  Believe me it is not like Bisquick as I thought it might be, it is so much better I was shocked.  And well now the family loves them and looks forward to Sunday waffles every couple weeks.  I even double up the ingredients so I can make extras which we cut into smaller sections and freeze them.  These can then be used for toster waffles and a quick breakfast.  Forget the Eggos even as frozen waffles these are great.<br /><br />What do I like best about them?  The waffles come out light and fluffy.  They are crisp and hold up well to being filled with strawberries, nuts or whatever toppings you may choose.  In no way do they feel heavy or soggy.  They are a snap to prepare, and take just 3 minutes in the waffle maker. Lastly the whole family loves them.  So despite the higher price it is well worth every penny.

review/summary: Tasty mixture but
review/text: I got this as a gift and liked the flavor but I wasn't crazy about the texture.  I like fluffy pancakes and believe it or not, imo, Aunt Jemima's buttermilk ready mix is the best one out there and it's so easy to make.<br />Of course, the best tasting waffles are made by me from scratch with buttermilk and all.=)<br />Overall, I think buying gourmet pancake mix is one of the biggest waste of money.  And it still requires you to put melted butter, milk, etc.<br />I am sticking with my own recipes and Aunt Jemima's if I am in a hurry.

review/summary: Mouthful in Name Only
review/text: Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix is definitely a mouthful in name but, in taste, not so much.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad but, you could find any number of "mixes" that taste just as well and some even better.  I know my taste buds aren't the same as yours so, what's just decent to me may be great to you.  I also wish I had bought just one can instead of 2 huge 33 ounce cans.  I finished the first can, I'll give the other can away and, I'll continue trying other mixes until I find the "best mix" out there.<br /><br />So far I seem to only be satisfied with a homemade mix for my waffles.  My preference is for waffles over pancakes but, this didn't make it on either count.  I even tried adding things to it but it didn't really help.  Maybe it's just me.  Try it if you like but remember, buy only one can just in case you're like me.  You can always buy more.

review/text: This waffle and pancake mix is delicious!  You can taste a subtle hint of vanilla in them.  They are the only pancakes/waffles that my kids love and the house smells wonderful when they are cooking!

review/summary: Best Belgian Waffles in No Time!
review/text: My family loves waffles. We have been trying to make homeade waffles for a while but when my second child was born, we got tired of all the mixing and measuring. We chose this batter mix because the reviews were so great. They take no time to mix. The dough comes out a bit runny but if you fill the bottom of the waffle iron completely, you get the fluffiest Belgian waffles. We are using the Chefman rotatable iron. I highly recommend this batter if you like waffles quick. You can add a little cinnamon and sugar too to spice it up.
