review/text: The large box these Rosemary Mini Croccatini were shipped in was much to large for this shipment!<br />The many pieces of bubble wrap didn't protect the 6 packs because the space within the box was huge, and the flat breads had too much space to move around in.

review/summary: Good Gluten-Free Flour
review/text: As a person who is sensitive to gluten, I must use alternative flours when cooking or baking.  This flour mix is created from a formula in Bette Hagman's "Gluten Free Gourmet Bakes Bread."  It is an excellent mix and can be used as is, (exchange rate: 1 for 1), for any recipe which already calls for rice flour.  In her book, Bette mentions that this flour does not have the protein levels found in wheat flour and that it is advisable to add protein (usually in the form of egg whites).<br /><br />I have converted many wheat flour recipes (for yeast breads, quick breads and cookies) to use this mix just by adding 1 - 2 egg whites and a couple teaspoons xanthan gum (to replace the gluten in wheat flour).  It should be noted that adding egg whites adds moisture to the recipe, so you'll need to eyeball whether or not you need to add less of another liquid or more of a dry ingredient.  Many times, I find that nothing else needs to be adjusted.<br /><br />Because I bake and cook a lot, I now mix my own Featherlight flour.<br /><br />One last thing, there is another mix made from bean flour which Bette claims exchanges 1:1 for wheat flour and can be substituted immediately into wheat recipes without the need for more protein (you'll still need the xanthan gum to replace the gluten when baking).  It should be noted that some people are "sensitive" to the taste of bean flour to the point of ruining the enjoyment of the baked goods.  In any case, it is called Bette's Four Bean Flour Blend<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007YBJIG">Authentic Foods' & Bette's Gourmet Four Flour Blend</a>

review/text: "Bette's Featherlight Rice Flour" put out by Authentic Foods is a great product, I love it! My baked goods turn out as though I used regular flour! The packaging is better than other brands that offer gluten free grains/flour - I use it as someone that is gluten intolerant but... I live in the rural country and there are no vendors that sell this particular product in my area so I have to buy it off-line... The only kicker about buying it off line is that the shipping cost is almost as much as the product itself so you end up paying double! It would be nice if Amazon could offer "free shipping" but...

review/text: When I was diaganosed with Celiac, I was thrilled to find Bette's Featherlight Rice Flour Blend. It can be used for any recipie with the addition of 1 teaspoon of powdered egg substitute and one teaspoon of xantham gum per cup of flour. Nut roll, snickerdoodles, oatmeal cookies, pinapple upsidedown cake, and all my old favorites turn out just as if they had been made with wheat flour. If your oatmeal cookie batter seems too thin, just add a little more flour.

JustCaviar called me at home, to say they WILL find my product and it WILL be sent to the recipient, and not to worry.  Sure enough...JustCaviar is true to their word, and my package is on it's way to the recipient.  In this day and age, to find such EXCELLENT service is unusual!

review/summary: For those who prefer light roasts
review/text: I have a Keurig in the office for guests (and I drink a cup occasionally, but usually my caffeine consumption is happening in the car on the way to work.) Now, I like dark roasts, and the famous "burnt flavor" of a lot of Starbucks blends is not to everyone's tastes. Some people like a light, aromatic, slightly acidic blend and Veranda is just that.<br /><br />There is a faint "woody" taste that I can detect but it doesn't detract from the light flavor. Milk or cream make this even milder and if that's how you like your brew, you may well like this very much. I keep some on hand and when we ask guests "do you prefer a light or a dark roast coffee?" it's surprising how many people don't like the ink-black French Roast that I typically drink (or the even darker Italian Roast.)<br /><br />It's all in what you like. So if you make coffee for guests, a few of these may be a welcome cup for the light roast folks.

review/summary: Best flavored seeds, yet you can't find them in any stores
review/text: Who the hell wants to buy pickle or nacho cheese flavored seeds? Yet, for some reason, they are sitting next to every cash register in America. Meanwhile, this is the greatest flavor to ever exist, and you have to scour the internet to find them.  The taste of these things is simply irresistible. There are no other seeds or flavors I have tried that will ever compare. And for those who say that Reds or other brands are better tasting, they must have some seriously screwy taste buds, because I have tried them all, and these blow them out of the water. Can't wait to get my 12 pack in the mail.

I received my 12 pack less than a week ago and already down to 6, of course I started sharing and now down to 4 packs. Everyone I share them with are now also hooked. Originally tried them over a year ago but don't see them in stores often, so when I did at a local store, I bought them until they ran out of stock, now ordering through Amazon! I really have to say Amazon's shipping is super fast on this order and others, even the estimated shipping arrival date is dead on, so far not a single problem. I love the change of using air cushions rather than Styrofoam.

review/summary: Best Sunflower Seeds EVER
review/text: I'm not one to resort to hyperbole but as sunflower seed enthusiast, these seeds are great. To be fair, not every bag is the same. Some seeds are lower quality than others but it does balance out if you have around 1 bag per week. Some people claim the flavor can be too much, which I understand, but for me it's perfect. While the BBQ flavored ones are sort of sweet, these are packed with jalapeno and salsa flavor.<br /><br />I used to go out of my way to find these Jalape&ntilde;o flavored seeds around DC but only two 7-11 stores had them. It was awful. Then came along Amazon. Packaging 12 packs in one box is genius. Now I'm stocked for a good 2 months and pay a great bulk price (since I end up buying the same amount over the same time period). It's just great.

Every bag so far ( I'm on the 6th of 12 ) has been poor in quality. The seeds are smaller, a lot of broken shell with no seeds, and a lot of "bad" seeds (kind of rancid tasting). It's as if they bagged up the floor sweepings.

review/summary: Excellent Blend of Flavor for Sunflower Seeds
review/text: I had only had regular and BBQ flavored David Sunflower Seeds, until I saw the Jalepeno Hot Salsa flavored sunflower seeds on Amazon.Com. Since I'm hooked on chewing seeds during baseball games and football games, I decided I would try some. Wow, what a pleasant surprise. I am now a confirmed Jalepeno Hot Salsa Flavor David Sunflower seed lover. These are the best I have ever tried. As a matter of fact, I won't watch a game without a pack of these wonderful seeds beside my recliner. I also love the fact that Amazon sells them in boxes containing 12 5.25 oz bags. Based on the local retail stores here, I save almost $1,00 per package too! If you like sunflower seeds and have not tried these, try them and be ready for a sunflower party inside your mouth. They are hard to put down,, once you get started, so you've been warned. Don't wait, Baseball playoffs will be here soon, the final 12 have been chosen for the NASCAR chase for the championship, and the NFL and NCAA are just beginning, plus I can't mow my lawn without a jaw full of the spicy seeds. Take it from me, you can't go wrong with this one.

Tried it on a his scratching post... and for the next 20 minutes plus, he's rolling, flipping, scratching, jumping off it... pretty funny to watch!  Just a spray or two is all it takes... and it lasts for a while too!  I always felt a little frustrated when I'd go a buy a toy only to have my cat take little to no interest in it.

review/summary: Cat didn't go for it
review/text: For whatever reason my cat didn't go for this catnip spray.<br /><br />I suspect that this spray works better for cats that are desperate for catnip - mine usually only gets moderately excited about catnip.  If your cat doesn't go that crazy about catnip to begin with (it's genetic), then I would skip this product.

review/text: The cats go nuts over regular catnip but they also eat it so I decided to give this a try. I shook it as directed before using it and it had no effect on them whatsoever. Maybe it's just the cats, but I won't be buying this again.

review/summary: Nasty Stuff - Cats Hate It!
review/text: I am owned by 5 cats and I foster another 17 cats for my local humane society, so I can give the reaction of 22 individual cats to this Kong Catnip Spray product. Most of these cats respond very positively to anything catnip - those who don't respond positively just don't respond to catnip much at all. I sprayed some of the Kong stuff on a couple of their favorite toys. I did notice a peculiar very unpleasant odor, but held the two toys out for the cats to sniff - they all took one sniff and bolted. This happened with all 22 of the cats, even those who don't normally have a reaction to catnip. I waited a couple of days just in case the scent was too strong, but got the same reaction. Really wish it did work as well as the reviews I read on the website......

review/text: I bought some toys I thought my kitten would play with which didn't have catnip in them. Others I bought did. I just got the kitten who was six months old. I had some small toys I thought if I'd spray this catnip on it, "Piper" would love them. He hated it, and the toys he had tried to play with, he didn't want to have anything to do with. I wouldn't waste my money on this product.

review/summary: Catnip spray entices my kitties and doesn't make a mess
review/text: In December 2011, I purchased an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010B8YT2">Omega Paw Ripple Board Scratch'n Massage Bed</a> for my cats. It comes pretreated with catnip oil, and I thought it would be nice to have some extra on hand to refresh the box every now and then.<br /><br />I found KONG Naturals Catnip Spray for Cats at Amazon and ordered it. Although the bottle isn't very big, it seems a little goes a long way. My four cats love the way it smells! Not only do I use it to refresh the Omega bed, but I have started using it on other things, like their cat tree and other things I want them to scratch and lay on. Just a squirt every now and then keeps the kitties interested and I think they've started to recognize the sound of that little bottle.<br /><br />What I really like about the spray is it isn't messy like spreading the dried catnip is. I still use the dried catnip inside some toys, but now I use the spray to attract the cats to whatever I want them to pay attention to.<br /><br />I will definitely be restocking this catnip spray when my current bottle starts to dwindle.

review/summary: Great replacement for my other brown rice!
review/text: I make a lot of curry, and had an issue with the typical brown rice flavour totally dominating a dish. For awhile I was forced to use white rice, but I know its not good to consume. I have always been meaning to try Lotus Foods rice, and took the dive and bought (2) 11 lb bags of this Mekong Flower Rice when I saw it go on sale. Boy, I tell you what, the fragrance when those grains cook is very pleasant! The rice is organic, whole grain, and although having a unique and 'lighter' taste, it was well received by my partner and I and we will stick to buying high quality Lotus Foods rices! Truly a treat and Amazon offers some of the best prices I have seen! Not to mention this company is awesome for protecting heirloom varieties of rice, using SRI sytems for rice growing, and giving work to farmers all over with fair pay for their labor.

review/summary: Mekong Flower Rice - Cambodian brown rice - The best!
review/text: I have always loved the brown jasmine rices of Thailand and other specialty rices of the Far East.  The Mekong Flower rice has become my very favorite and my husband now raves about it as much as I do.  He was not too excited that I had bought 11 pounds and was disappointed that he wasn't getting the brown jasmine last night.  When the Mekong Flower rice started cooking (in a small clay pot on top of stove) and that wonderful aroma began to fill the kitchen, he decided this new rice might be a winner.  It was perfect. The flavor was delicate, the grains cooked perfectly and there was not even a grain leftover.<br /><br />For an unforgettable and really flavorful dinner, try it with any of the Rancho Gordo heirloom beans (cooked in a clay bean pot) and laddle the beans over the rice.  I'm on the list to be advised when this rice is back in stock.  It's just that good!!!  Both grains and beans just taste better and earthier in a good clay pot on top of the stove.

review/summary: My favorite brown rice
review/text: Mekong Flower Rice has become my favorite brown rice:  it's organic; it's whole grain; it cooks up fluffy and tender unlike other brown rice varieties I've tried over the years; and it's farmed using a System of Rice Intensification (which results in higher crop yields with less water, less seed, less land, and NO chemicals).  And it's now available at an even lower price through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program.  What's not to love?<br /><br />By the way, I use one cup of rice to one and three-quarters cups water and soak for 12-24 hours before cooking.  The rice cooks up in approximately 20 minutes when pre-soaked.  I started pre-soaking my rice several years ago when I realized that if soaking increases the digestability of beans, why wouldn't it do the same for grains?  Pre-soaking makes for plumper more tender rice.  Give it a try!

review/summary: Paper bag instead of plastic
review/text: Previously when I had ordered this rice it came in a fully sealed plastic bag. I loved the rice and that is why I ordered more.<br /><br />....but...<br /><br />Without any change to the advertised description, the rice came in a paper bag.  The paper bag was not made water/air proof in any way, even for shipping.  Obviously this does not seem sanitary at all and I will not be eating it. I have received a refund. Amazon has not acknowledged that the photo for this product does not represent the actual product being sent, nor the potential health risk.<br /><br />I will still buy from Lotus Foods, but will be more careful to buy in smaller quantities less likely to be switched to inappropriate packaging.  I will not mark down this organic item from 5 star, but others whom are concerned about the potential for contamination from packaging not airtight should be cautious.

I've tried it twice in the past year, and each time suffered a serious reaction (I have a very high level of sensitivity to gluten).  The first time, in 2011, I wasn't sure if it was the rice or perhaps something else.  So in 2012 I tried it once more, this time being very careful that there were no other foods that could influence the outcome.  The reaction the second time was even worse.<br /><br />I don't have any problems with Lundberg Bros. rice products or Tinkyada or Jovial brands of rice pasta.

review/summary: Smells and Tastes Moldy
review/text: When I first opened the box that the 11-lb sack came in, it produced an aroma I couldn't place my finger on.  I set it to cook in the rice cooker, and the distinct smell of mold pervaded my home.  Amazon was kind enough to send me another bag to try out, however, it too carried the same strong scent.  Mold can be toxic, causing anything from allergies to diarrhea to more serious illnesses, especially if you have an injured immune system.  I eat rice everyday, and I've never had this experience before (usually, it will be a rancid oil smell, if any).  I do not recommend this eating this rice if you sense it is at all "off"-smelling.  Trust your nose.

review/summary: Good rice from a Great company
review/text: This long-grain brown rice smells more like green tea to me than floral.  It arrived to me quickly and in fresh condition from Amazon.<br /><br />Organic Mekong Flower Rice(tm) - Cambodia's Floral Brown Rice, Imported from Cambodia<br /><br />Mekong Flower is called 'Phka Malis' in Khmer, which means beautiful garland of flowers, because of its delicate floral aroma. Leaving the germ and bran layer intact intensifies its fragrance and nutty flavor while retaining the highest nutritional value. This nourishing whole grain rice has a lovely supple texture - unlike the chewy and bland taste of some brown rice.<br /><br />Perfect in dishes that will showcase its delicate fragrance, Mekong Flower is nutritious and flavorful.<br /><br />Perfect for all cuisines, it can be used steamed plain, in a pilaf, stir-fry, salad or pudding.<br /><br />Mekong Flower is chiefly grown on small family plots by households belonging to the Damrei Romeal Organic Rice Cooperatives in Takeo, a province dominated by rice fields and sugar palm trees. Cooperative members are using a set of growing methods, called the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), which enable smallholder farmers to harvest more rice from their traditional varieties using less water, seed, land and no chemicals. Researchers have found that the major aromatic compound in rice is increased in response to water stress. With SRI, farmers drain their paddies periodically, which may explain why Cambodian consumers are saying that SRI-grown 'Phka Malis' is more aromatic and better tasting. Visit our SRI section to learn more about this amazing system that is transforming the rice-growing world.<br /><br /># Cooks in 30 minutes<br /># Whole grain and heart healthy<br /># High in fiber, trace minerals and vitamins<br /># High in phytonutrients and antioxidants<br /># 3rd year transition, organic certification<br /># Fair trade<br /># Gluten and wheat free

review/summary: Jasmine scented heirloom organic brown rice!  Love it!
review/text: Gives off the loveliest jasmine scent while cooking ( no worries, it's not "perfumed"--see the product description on Lotus Foods' site for full details).<br /><br />The texture is just right, not mushy or "fiber-y".  And the flavor is distinctly different, kind of nutty.  Not a bland starchy flavor.  And the hull isn't so tough you feel like you're chewing cud...<br /><br />With some brown rice varieties, sauces aren't absorbed well...not with the Mekong Flower rice.  When cooked properly, the kernels open up suggesting a petal shape.  I've been pleasantly surprised to discover, this rice is less starchy---even compared to long-grain brown rice---yet absorbs flavors well.<br /><br />I cook up enough for few meals and refrigerate it. If you have a batch ready to go, there are endless ways to incorporate this whole grain into what you already eat.  Add to hot oatmeal, cold green salads; no-cook side dishes ready in minutes(toss with diced veg and lemon-EVOO dressing for easy, healthy item to go with summer grilled main dishes);<br /><br />For a special treat, add coconut milk when cooking---even ho-hum chicken gets elevated being served on the same plate. Especially delish with Indian and SouthEast asian flavors.  Caribbean, too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!  I find the 11 pound to be a great value for organic brown rice.  Less so with the 6-pk version.

review/text: I am a fan of Lotus Foods. I like that their rice products are organic or transitioning to organic and I really like that they help farms with sustainable, low water farming. So 5 stars for the company! As for the brown rice, I like that as well. It's not amazing, but it's about as tasty as brown rice can get. If you like this, I recommend looking into the Lotus Foods Forbidden Rice. That variety is just a nutritious, but much tastier.

review/summary: Mekong Flower Rice: Tasty, & Nutritious!!
review/text: This is the 2nd variety of rice that I've tried from this brand.  (FYI, the "Forbidden" (black/purple) rice is out of this world!!)<br /><br />  Being that this is organic, ecologically farmed, and fairly traded- the price seems extremely reasonable (especially with the "subscribe & save" discount)!  The reviews seemed promising, so I took the plunge!!  Thankfully they were all right on target; hands down, this is the BEST brown rice my family and I have ever tried! It's not tough, or chewy, and doesn't take very long to cook.<br />  To be honest, when I first opened the bag, the scent almost smelled a little rancid (but maybe that's just the way rice bran smells??).  However, our fears were allayed with the first bite!  It's got a very pleasing taste, and not overpowering.  I've tried it in 4 different dishes/ways, and each time it's been a perfect addition!  (With Kung Pao chicken & veggies, in a "Nueva Cocina" chili mix, homemade lentil soup, and with cinnamon, sugar, and milk.)<br /><br />  I'm definitely looking forward to trying more of the "Lotus Foods" rice varieties; but I'm sure I'll be buying another bag of this before too long!!<br /><br />EDIT:  Since the above review, I purchased the "Madagascar Pink", sadly my family and I didn't like it as well as the "Mekong". It was a bit dry and bland.<br />We also tried the "Jade Pearl", and liked it much better than the "MP".<br />While it's definitely a rice suited for sushi makers, we purchased it to try with stir-fry's and such.  It's actually really tasty with Chicken "Korma".<br />______<br /><br />After ordering the "Mekong" twice, I decided to switch to a brown Thai Jasmine (by "Village Harvest"). In short it's EXCELLENT, and a new favorite staple in my kitchen!

review/summary: maybe I got a bad batch...
review/text: I really wanted to like this rice as we are avid brown rice consumers in this family. I enthusiastically opened the bag the day it was delivered, looking forward to cooking up a batch for lunch. Hiding just underneath the top layer of rice was a long black hair. I gingerly pulled it out and examined it. Gross, but since I didn't see anymore, it wasn't enough to completely squelch my enthusiasm for trying this new wonderful looking rice. The rice cooked up light and fluffy, and looked delicious in the pot, however, it did not taste delicious. It had a strange off flavor to it. When my husband tried it, he pronounced it inedible, saying that it tasted like mildew and that perhaps it had been processed in dirty water. I'm guessing that since other people have rated it 5-star, we must have gotten a bad batch, but I'm not planning on re-ordering it. I'll stick to our favorite tried and true Nishiki brown rice for now. On contacting Amazon regarding the problem, we were issued a complete refund.

(disclaimer: my kids have never been allergic to milk or eggs and I started them on it pretty early, you might wanna add formula)

review/summary: Great source of protein and my son LOVES it!
review/text: My son loves this "soup".  The consistency of the soup is basically the same as thick, smooth baby food (it just doesn't have any chunky bits of food in it as most Stage 3 baby foods do, which qualifies it as a "soup" apparently). When my son was 8 months old, he had a hard time adjusting to chunky foods (gagging and choking, etc.), but I needed to buy him some protein-rich baby foods, as we were weaning.<br /><br />I was also buying the Sweet Potato and Chicken meal (stage 2), but I really wanted the larger serving that this jar offered. Upon comparing the nutritional content on the two jars, I discovered that this soup has as much protein per serving as the actual meal labeled as Sweet Potato and Chicken - perfect!<br /><br />I was slightly concerned that the "cinnamon" might cause him gas issues or digestive discomfort (it does me sometimes and he is a spitter-upper), but he has no problems whatsoever. And he LOVES the taste. He will eat a whole jar in no time flat (at room temperature, me spooning it in).<br /><br />My son is now almost 14 months old. He is in the 95% for height and 55% for weight. He has never really adjusted to chunky baby food, which I can't explain, as he now eats finger foods, bananas, berries, pb&j, mac and cheese, chicken, etc. just fine self-feeding. But I still use these Earth's Best Soups pretty much daily to supplement his dinner, to make sure he keeps his weight up to how fast he is growing.  He eats on his own for awhile and then I feed him a jar of soup. He still loves them and it is great having an easy source of protein on hand.

They are soft but not smooshy, they are juicy and frankly, taste a LOT like Jolly Rancher watermelon candy!  So if you like those, you'll love these.

review/text: The picture at the time of this review is incorrect, so I uploaded my own.  I thought I was ordering watermelon rings, but received the gummy bears. Oh well, it does say BEARS in the description and wasn't worth returning, so I opened one of the bags and tried some. Now I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />Immediately they tasted unpleasant, but vaguely familiar. It sounds strange but they taste like sour grass lawn clippings. Okay so I ate weird things as a kid, but now I have a bad aftertaste that won't go away.<br /><br />I guess I'll give them to my neighbor's kids, they should love them.

review/summary: Izzy can eat it without getting sick! *edited to address ingredient concerns
review/text: Our Mini Schnauzer, Izzy, has a sensitive tummy, a pleasant way of describing very unpleasant side effects if she eats treats that are to rich. Greenies gave her the runs, bully sticks gave her the runs, pupperoni, rawhide, pig's ears, well, you get the idea. Plus, I wanted to start buying her treats made in the USA, so now I had a double challenge.<br /><br />I did find her lamb's ears, which are much less greasy and fatty than the pigs and she did fine, but I wanted options. The vet has me giving her a tsp of yogurt a day with her breakfast, a sensitive stomach and skin brand, to help balance out her tummy issues. When I found these belly bone Yogurt dog bones I was really excited. They are made in the US, give her something healthy to chew, and she loves them.<br /><br />I love them because she can one a day with no side effects. I get to give her a treat, made in the USA, with healthy ProBiotic yogurt powder, and she thinks it's the best treat ever.<br /><br />*Edited, based on another review I googled, as far as I can tell belly bone is under no recall anywhere. Furthermore, Rosemary extract is common and will be found in most dog foods, from blue and diamond brands on down. Holistic sites seems concerned but there doesn't seem to be concrete medical evidence to back this claim up, but I encourage everyone to research and make up your own mind.<br /><br />garlic- yes, garlic is toxic to dogs, however, again many treats use a small amount of powdered garlic. Again this is not an uncommon ingredient. It threw me off too until I did research and the ASPCA site was the most helpful, talking about how the garlic in dog food and treats is somehow treated plus the amount is so small as to not be toxic in general. Again, do your own research.<br /><br />I've had tremendous success feeding Izzy this treat. But if you are going to stop using this treat because of the ingredients listed you really need to look at all dog foods and treats, you'll be amazed at how much your dog will not be able to eat.

I am not the only one who has had this experience with Rosemary extract and garlic. My dog is very young and he never had seizures before ingesting this product. Now that he is not ingesting the Rosemary extract (and garlic), he is no longer having the seizures.  Amazon told me that they are requesting recall on this product and other FIDO products with Rosemary extract in them.

review/summary: Unique Sprouted Pretzel Splits ingredients and overview
review/text: What is "Sprouted" you ask? Well, these Splits are made with a wheat flour that digests like a vegetable... because the wheat was "Sprouted" or germinated. Amazingly, when whole grains are sprouted, they are converted into a living food with more vital nutrients. The nutrients are now in a form that the body can more easily absorb. Think of a sprouted whole grain as a plant. Plants digest in the body as vegetables and are some of the easiest foods to digest.<br /><br />Our organic Sprouted whole grain flour is made by Essential Eating and tastes absolutely wonderful as it has not been bleached, refined or overly processed. We also use an organic extra virgin olive oil.<br /><br />Our Sprouted "Splits" are one of the very few snacks that are not bad for you AND tastes GREAT!!<br /><br />Here is a list of "first and onlys" in the pretzel industry:<br />This is the only Sprouted Flour pretzel in mass production<br />The only 100% Whole Grain Sprouted Flour pretzel<br />The only pretzel made with Olive Oil... and it is organic, extra virgin at that!<br />The only pretzel to naturally provide 4 grams of Fiber per serving... no additives needed<br />The only pretzel with over 35% whole grains that doesn't use any sugar or malt additives.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Enjoyable snack, very high in sodium
review/text: I really love pumpkin seeds and this is a great deal. You could expect to buy these in the store for $1.99. All the seeds were very clean and had a delicious flavor, although not nearly as good as the ones I make each Halloween after carving pumpkins. The backside labeling is deceptive. It states that a serving (1/4 cup) has 10 mg of sodium, but if you read down further you will find that 1/4 cup actually has 940 mg. Since most people eat these in the shell, or at minimum shell them in your mouth, you do have to watch your sodium on these. The price is great on Amazon, and the quality of David seeds is excellent. Each 5 oz bag states it has 4 (1/4 cup) servings, but it actually lasts about 6 servings for me.

One brand was so horrible I had to send them back and the other was good but way over salted.

review/summary: Good Snacking!
review/text: If you're ever looking for a light snack to accompany watching television, a ball game or something like that, try David Pumpkin Seeds. They're lightly roasted, lightly salted and all natural. And they're delicious!<br /><br />Some people eat the entire seed, but I only eat the kernels. Thus, I have to crack each seed, extract the kernel and dispose of the hulls. This process can be somewhat time consuming, but like everything else, you get better and better with practice. Still, some people would regard this as a negative, but I would regard it as a positive. I can sometimes spend all evening consuming a delicious snack and watching TV and consume less than a single serving which amounts to 280 calories. Plus, seeds and nuts carry a heavy caloric load in general, to be sure, but they also carry a lot of vitamins, minerals, unsaturated vegetable fat and fiber. They may have calories, but they aren't empty calories! I worry a little about the salt content, but the David seeds are only lightly salted and I don't consume the entire seed.<br /><br />These David Pumpkin Seeds are a fine light snack. Prepare to get addicted. I'll bet you can't eat just one, or one pack. They can be a little hard to find, but finding large quantities online is easy. Good snacking!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: David Pumpkin seeds are the best.  Most pumpkin seeds have such a thick outer shell (or layer of salt) that  you can't eat the whole thing.  These are light and crisp and you can either eat the whole seed, or bust it open and just eat the inside.<br />My only complaint with these are the price.  After signing up for the automatic shipments, Amazon hiked the price up.  So, after my first automatic shipment, I had to cancel.  I guess from now on, I'll have to wait for them to be on sale, (Conagra is the maker, and Amazon puts Conagra items on sale every few months), and stock up on them when they are.

review/text: I've been eating these since I was 12, I'm 24 now, and I'm addicted to Sunflower Seeds and Pumpkin Seeds. These are sort of a guilty pleasure for me. They are so good and rewarding, and the Amazon price is such a good deal, that I opted for 1 order a month with subscribe & save, and this is my 4th month before I finally decided to write a review. I am pleasantly pleased with the quality and taste of these seeds. The salt and roastedness! makes them so good. As strange as it may sound, when I eat these, i'm on a cloud in low Carb Heaven!<br /><br />These only have 10mg of sodium, they are not full of salt like some reviews say, the salt is just a different and stronger taste than your average shelf salt. However, if you eat these a bag at a time, your inside bottom lip, and tongue will get really raw! Just give it 24hrs, and rinse and repeat!<br /><br />Get Subscribe & Save! If you buy these often, quit paying ridiculous inflated prices at your local grocery!

review/summary: Not 'Lightly' Salted
review/text: We are pumpkin seed fanatics!  We can't wait for the 'season', so we can make our own.  I used David & Son's in the off-season because that's the only time we can get them.  We roast them further with some olive oil and pepper which gives them much better flavor... Unfortunately, the salt level is SO HIGH, your tongue curls up after just a few!  I called them to see if they were available 'roasted-NO or LOW salt added', then we could control.. nope.  They were very cool on the phone and offered coupons in the mean time along with passing along the desire for no-low salt added versions.  That was cool... but until then... I'm trying to soak them in water first to see if i removes some of the salt.. I'll let you know how it goes.... stay tuned...

review/summary: A tasty, healthy, lowfat treat
review/text: I recommend this product to everyone.  The quality of these pumpkin seeds is top notch.  The larger bags provide larger seeds which are easier to crack open.  I can go through a bag in one day so purchasing a box of them saves me time and space at the grocery store cart and bag.  And they are delivered right to my door!

review/summary: excellent and will be reordering
review/text: this hard to find item was reasonably priced, quanity was a decent amount, sent very quickly, well packed and now almost gone.  since they are prepacked, a few pumpkin seeds were bad but 90 percent were tasty and ready to eat.  Will be ordering more by next month

review/summary: Way too salty
review/text: I give these three stars because the quality is good and, apart from the salt, they taste great. But they are way too salty. Is there a low salt version out there?

review/summary: Very pleased with this product
review/text: Since we discovered this product through Amazon, there's no turning back.  We love these pumpkin seeds.  Our local grocery stores are going to wonder what happened to the "pumpkin seed" customer, because we were in the habit of clearing the shelves of pumpkin seeds every time we shopped in the stores.
