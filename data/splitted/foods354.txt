review/summary: Very creamy flavor
review/text: I was expecting the cookies and cream flavor to have at least a bit of a chocolate taste.  I couldn't detect any chocolate really, but it does have a very nice creamy flavor.  I have to say that my favorite Baskins-Robbins flavor is the pralines and cream.  But if you are looking for a good, smooth vanilla-flavored candy, this cookies and cream flavor is the one you want.<br /><br />Because they use Splenda as the sweetener, the candies have no bitter after-taste. This candy allows me to have all of the sweetness of regular hard candies with none of the guilt. The package says that the serving size is four pieces, with a total calorie count of 40 calories. That works out to just 10 calories per candy. It's a guilt-free treat!<br /><br />The Baskins-Robbins candies are made in the USA. I prefer to save an American job when I can, so for me that's yet another reason to buy this brand of candy.

review/summary: Really Sugar-Free?
review/text: Used to buy these babies locally until they stopped stocking it. Just as well as these were cheaper by the case. Bought one of the Pralines and one of the Cookies and Cream. Hard to believe these are really sugar-free. They are as good as or better than anything that actually has sugar. Not very low calorie but for those of us monitoring our sugar intake these are a god-send. Thank you Mr. Baskin-Robbins!

review/summary: Dyeing wool
review/text: I needed alum for dyeing my hand spun wool with natural colors.  I got the package delivered at home fine and on time, but only then realized that I got aluminium sulfate (Al2(SO4)3), instead of potassium aluminium sulfate ( KAl(SO4)2.12H2O). Those two have very different properties, and I cannot use aluminium sulphate in dyeing, because it does not open wool fibers as potassium aluminium sulphate does.  According to Wikipedia, this is a common misnomer.  Adding the chemical formula would have helped me a great deal and saved time.  The package I was delivered did not have the chemical formula on it, it only had the name aluminium sulphate on it.  Also, the chemical formula was not mentioned on the website at all. Proper naming would have made my life a lot easier.<br />  The product itself was in very good condition when it arrived at home, and I was impressed how well it was packaged.

I am using this Alum to make wallpaper paste: just google "care2 wallpaper paste". I have since checked out the Barry Farms Website, they have many quality products (also available on Amazon). In fact, I have already ordered two more products from them for use in preserving and yoghurt making. Needless to say selecting this product illuminated the world of Barry Farms, with all the good quality they have to offer.

review/text: Ok so let me start this out by saying I am an avid Costco Maple syrup eater...and getting this was an attempt at something new. I was excited to try it, but disappointed when I did. The flavor is veryyyyy light, almost unnoticeable. I was hoping for a more robust flavor, so I think I'm going to try the dark amber grade A version from Sugarworks. I'd have to agree with a lot of the reviews on here that the syrup wasn't really worth the price, but to each their own. Restating something I readin another review, the syrup isn't from one particular farm, it seemed like a blend from different farms from different states. Who knows, but I wouldn't say it's not worth buying, I'd recommend it to those who like the flavor of really light maple syrup.

We find Grade A a little too refined and generally prefer the Grade B for its more raw flavor and thicker consistency, but we do like the clarity of Grade A. This maple nectar is the best of both: rich, meady flavor AND the perfect degree of refinement. A perfect blend. Go for it.

Grade B is better for Baking and putting on top of Ice Cream. I ordered this and it arrived in 2 days via Amazon Prime. The product is great.

review/summary: Good syrup; a little weaker than Vermont grade
review/text: This good maple syrup, in medium amber, the most popular grade.  It's from Vermont, which has slightly more stringent standards about maple syrup density.  Thus I was surprised that this Highland Sugarworks syrup was weaker than the L.L. Bean syrup I was about to run out of.  But reading the label provides a clue to my disappointment.  It's labeled "Pure NEW ENGLAND Maple Syrup", as opposed to "Pure VERMONT Maple Syrup".  The reverse of the label says "We also purchase syrup from our friends and neighbors".  (The L.L. Bean container says "Packed in Vermont".)  So I conclude that this is rated on the (weaker) U.S. scale rather than the Vermont scale.<br /><br />It's still good syrup; it just seems a bit "watered-down" compared to what I expected.

The first time I made it I substituted half the butter for yogurt.  They were moist and delicious.  I still felt guilty about the added fat of the butter so the second time I used all yogurt.  They were fantastic!  Please give these a try, they are filling but not as heavy as you would expect, considering they are whole grain.

review/summary: Out of this world delicious.
review/text: Best brownies I've ever eaten. Seriously delicious. They have a grainy texture that I love, but are still extremely moist and chewy. The mix requires you to add butter, two eggs and a couple of tablespoons of oil and water, but you do not need an electric mixer and it is simple to stir everything together with a wooden spoon. The directions say to melt the butter before adding it to the mix, and since you must also grease the pan, I follow this little trick to make life easier: I melt the butter in the microwave inside the glass pan that I am going to bake the brownies in. After it is melted, I tip the pan from side to side to coat the bottom and sides, then I pour the melted butter into the bowl that I am using to mix everything together. After mixing I pour the batter back into the buttered glass pan. This way I don't need to use cooking spray to coat the pan, nor do I need to dirty a separate small bowl to melt the butter, plus the brownies taste better when the pan is buttered instead of coated with Pam. A win-win!<br /><br />Another thing I have done is bake half the mix to make a smaller batch of brownies and save the rest for another time. This is easy to do because the amount of eggs and butter called for is easy to divide in half (two eggs means you can half it and use one egg; 1/2 cup butter goes to 1/4 cup, 2 tbsp oil goes to 1 tbsp).<br /><br />Note that the brownie mix has chunks of chocolate in it--and very good chocolate at that.  That must be why they call it "double chocolate."  I wasn't sure if I would like this but it is fabulous.  The quality of the chocolate alone justifies the fact that this mix cost more than other mixes.  Trust me--you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />PS - their pancake/waffle mix is great, too, and for that you only add water. It is so easy and so much better than Bisquick, Krusteaz, etc.<br /><br />PPS - I just read the other reviews and I see that many people are commenting on the health aspects such as whole wheat and no fillers.  I did not buy these for that reason but what a terrific bonus.  They are so good I would buy them as a special treat even if they were bad for me.  :)

review/summary: Delicious and fudgy from a "nut-free facility"
review/text: We love these brownies!  They bake up rich and fudgy and so very delicious.  Ingredients: crystallized cane juice, 100% whole grain wheat flour, all natural dark chocolate chips, natural cocoa, natural vanilla, salt, leavening, vital wheat gluten.  The box says, specifically "Contains: wheat and soy, and traces of milk and eggs. Made in a nut-free facility."  We used to be able to find these on the shelf at our local grocery store.  Now, we order a case (6 boxes) from Amazon and always keep some on hand.  Easy, tasty, our family's favorite!

review/summary: Best brownie mix EVER!
review/text: We started eating healthier about 9 years ago and a major part of that was eating all 100% whole grains.  Now, these are brownies, so they have a lot of sugar in them, so that does not fit in with our lifestyle as much, but if you are going to be bad a least do it 100% whole grain with excellent taste and texture!  They are so richly chocolate it is amazing, and the chocolate chips don't hurt either!  Honestly you'd never know they are 100% whole grain.  they do take quite a lot of fat, a whole stick of butter plus 2 T oil, but you can substitute.  It is said that for any brownie mix on the market, to make them more healthy you can substitute any/all of the fats/liquids asked for in the instructions except the eggs (so like oil, butter, water) for an equal amount of any of the following: yogurt, apple sauce, pureed black beans.  I have not been brave enough yet to try the black beans, but I did try yogurt and apple sauce, they were fine, there was a bit of taste to each of those but not too much, and of course the texture was a little different without the fat.  We belong to a CSA and get a 3/4 bushel box of fresh local organic veggies/fruit each week during the growing season and one week I had a bundle of baby beet that I did not know what to do with, so I boiled them, peeled them, pureed them, and substituted them in the Big Bear Brownies for the oil, butter, and water,and they were great!  I served them twice when company was over and everyone loved them and asked for seconds, and my girls love them and ask for more and dig the slight pink tint they brownies have.  Next I am going to experiment with pureed summer squash :)  Now I am just waiting for Kodiak Cakes to come up with a recipe for chocolate cake!  No matter what you do, if you want to still be able to eat brownies but want to do it healthier without sacrificing a thing then get these brownies!

review/summary: Overpriced and overrated
review/text: Not going to lie - I got these due to the packaging. Hey, I had money left over, so why not get a nice high quality brownie mix too?<br /><br />For a little bit of background, I love to home-bake and I'm the kind of guy that enjoys waking up to a nice breakfast I prepare for myself. I have a deep respect and interest in appreciating quality over quanity. Granted I'll get the cheapo brand for a lot of stuff, but when it comes to something I don't regularly make (like Brownies or Pancakes) I'll totally go up a notch and either buy the nicer brand or get good quality ingredients to scratch-cook it myself (with college and work though, I only do scratch cooking now if time and patience permits!).<br /><br />However I was pretty disappointed by these. By far, at about $4.68 per box at my local store, this was the most expensive brownie mix you could get on the shelf (keep in mind you still need to have all the other ingredients including the oil, eggs, butter). I'm a huge fan of skipping fillers and keeping to the good stuff so I tried them out.<br /><br />Unfortunatly, these brownies bake pretty dry. The moist fudgy/cake-like taste you expect from brownies was totally absent and their texture is closer to a thick gingerbread more than anything. They taste noticably worse than even the 99c brownies you can buy, and the wheat-nature of the brownies doesn't seem to enough of a saving grace to warrant an insane $5 price tag per small box (I love whole wheat, I only buy whole wheat bread and enjoy wheat pancakes). Mind you they don't taste bad, but they simply aren't what you'd expect out of a $5 box of brownies.<br /><br />As far as health goes, for a fraction of the price, you can easily scratch-cook your own brownies using coco and whole wheat flour for a fraction of the cost. As a matter of fact, that's pretty much what the ingredients are for this - so if you are a fan of wholesome no-bull baked goods, you're better off just making it yourself. And seeing how easy brownies are to make, its not a major inconvenience to do this either. If I am going all out on buying a dessert mix (what this brand is priced at), you might as well put the tiny amount of extra effort to combine the coco and flour yourself. If I am in the mood for no-frills, then I can get a better tasting experience just buying 99c brownies (even if it uses white enriched instead of whole wheat).

The flavor was difficult to discern because of the difficulty I had chewing these dried pears. I would recommend their apple chips. They are small, but tasty and definately chip-like in texture and much easier to eat.

review/summary: Deee-licious! Sweet, Chewy, Healthy Treat!
review/text: *****<br />These dried D'Anjou pears are very sweet, very chewy and very yummy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, and they are gluten free. There are 2 servings in every 2.2 ounce bag, with 81 calories in each serving. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />Note that as these are a natural food, they may contain occasional seeds, stems, or core fragments. This doesn't sound good, but I didn't really notice much of anything at all that I couldn't eat or that was hard. These dried pears are very fibrous (like jerky), so you need to have healthy teeth to be able to chew them. I totally loved them--I think they are my favorite of all of the Bare Fruit snacks!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

It is not the cheapest food you can buy, but the price is on the low end, especially when compared to small bags of premium brand dog food.  The bits are well-sized for small breeds and my 10 pound dog has no trouble at all.

review/text: I love these chips. They're big and they taste great and they're my favorite chip by far. But that's not what I'm writing about. I'm writing about they way I received a box of these from Amazon and they were destroyed. Almost all the bags were opened and bits of the chips were everywhere - it looked like someone set off a bomb in my box of chips. So I called Amazon and complained, and they were nice enough to send me another box. But the new box arrived in the same sorry state state as the original box.<br /><br />I wrote an email to Madhouse Munchies and told them I love their chips but unfortunately Amazon doesn't know how to ship them so I'm going to have to buy some crappy Tostitos down at the local ShopRite. A girl from Madhouse responded with some questions. What kind of box did it arrive in? A white box with a perforated section that wasn't punched out.  What? That's a display box - those idiots aren't supposed to ship them in that! Well, that's what they sent me both times. Okay, we'll ship you a new box from the factory. And they did. It was the same white box only it was packaged INSIDE another bigger box, and everything arrived in perfect shape, crunch, crunch, oh yeah.<br />She also told me they would talk to Amazon about how to ship their products and I guess they did, because I've ordered them again from Amazon many times and they've always arrived with the improved packaging and they've always been perfect.

review/text: Holy pizza, Batman! We just put this on our pizza tonight, and it is the best sauce we have used so far. Just the right amount of sauce, nice big chunks of flavorful tomato. I never want to try anything else, now. Unfortunately, the cost is a little pricey for my budget, but the price here at Amazon is definitely the best I have seen. Muir Glen knows how to treat a tomato!

review/summary: Beware Bpa.
review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Everyday Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/summary: Do not buy - disgusting
review/text: My husband bought this donut mix for me to try with our mini donut maker.  We had been using recipes for our donut batter and thought we'd try something different. Unfortunately, the donuts we made with this mix were disgusting.  The texture was okay, but the taste was artificial and left a bad aftertaste.  The chocolate was fake and chemically, the frosting being even worse than the donut itself.  We'll stick to making our own batter and using real ingredients.

review/text: Before buying this, I was dissuaded by the negative reviews on this.<br /><br />Agree that this does not have a super strong ginger flavor which comes out and hits at you, but a subtle flavor which you can enjoy.<br /><br />For a perfect blend, boil (yes boil, not dip) 2 tea bags in 250 ml of water or milk.

review/summary: Seems good for this type of thing
review/text: This is not only pre-seasoned, but it makes it's own sauce.  Not too much, but a fair amount.  It's good; however if you let this sit a bit, it will congeal.<br /><br />This product makes a good balancer for spicy toppings; it helps to cut some of the heat when served with spiced foods.<br /><br />I admit that I'm not quite used to these kinds of products, since I typically have made rice from scratch; but I've been trying a few different convenience products just to check them out.  So this, like all of them, has that "convenience food" quality to it, and you aren't going to confuse it with fresh; but for what it is, it's a nice basic that has a lot of applications.

review/text: Lipton Rice Sides, Herb & Butter is something to keep on hand so you're never without a quick meal. It's got a wonderful flavor (not overpowering) and a nice texture.<br /><br />Use your imagination and add shrimp, beef, pork, diced chicken,toasted nuts, etc.! There are no limits to what you can make with it by adding leftovers or whatever you have on hand. Take that ground meat you would have used for burgers, cook up some mini-meatballs and toss them with the rice! Put broccoli flowerettes around the sides, sprinkle with grated parmesan or cheddar!<br /><br />You can have lots of fun with this product!

review/summary: Better than Chocolate!
review/text: This product is amazing. The smell as soon as the bag is open is heavenly - such a 'real' chocolate aroma. And the taste is so much better!<br />It is promoted as being able to brew just like coffee - that is you can use it in a drip machine or french press. But it doesn't 'taste' like coffee - this is full on chocolate tasting!!  Personally I dont like it made with water, I prefer the creaminess of a hot chocolate made with milk.  But i do make the concentrate as per instructions on their website - mix some Crio Bru (quite a bit!) with sugar and water - boil and simmer to make a cacao concentrate that can be added to anything for a chocolate fix.  Even poured over ice cream!  And that it has no sugar or fat (marginal) of its own - it is guilt free, which you just cant believe as you take a sip - the flavour is so much fuller, stronger, smoother than any hot chocolate or even candy bar I've had. And I'll happily give them up and live on Crio Bru!  The only down side is that being ground cacao beans, you do need to strain any liquid drinks or syrups you make - although they grind is quite edible on its own if you dont mind a bit of 'roughage'. It is great added into granola or the like 'raw' straight from the pouch.

review/summary: Salsa of the Month was Great!
review/text: I just received The Salsa of the Month Club package and everything was great!  I was excited to try two new salsas from different specialty companies that I would've never been able to try.  They arrived in a sturdy box with foam packing peanuts.  I admit that I was a little nervous that they wouldn't arrive safely, but the glass jars were completely fine.  They were even accompanied by a newsletter giving some background about the salsas and the companies who made them.  They both looked so good, it was hard to decide which one to open first!  My wife and I decided to open the Pink's Mild Salsa from Pennsylvania to accompany our fajitas that we were making for dinner.  It was bold, fresh and made with minimal ingredients and also contained no allergens.  Medically, my wife has to follow a Gluten Free diet, so we are always concerned with allergens and trying to eat foods closer to nature.  A few days later we opened the second salsa (after scraping the first jar dry) and were equally impressed!  The second jar was a Picante Salsa from Hillside Orchard farms in Georgia and was very flavorful and had some visibly large cilantro pieces (my favorite), but was not as chunky as the other one.  This one was great to pour over tacos, as it had more of a sauce consistency, but it was a little harder to pick up with a chip.  Overall, I was very satisfied and I'm looking forward to next month's salsas!  This was the perfect gift for us and would highly recommend the Salsa of the Month Club!
