review/summary: A darned good Mother's Day gift
review/text: I bought this product, the "Art of Appreciation Gift Baskets Decadent Chocolate Truffle Treats", for my wife for Mother's Day.  My wife has reached the point in her life where she doesn't like me to buy her jewelry very much ("I have more than I can wear now!"), and while flowers are nice, a guy can't just get his girl flowers on every occasion.  But good chocolate ... now there is something she's never told me she's gotten too much of.  :-)  With that in mind, I searched around to find a chocolate gift basket for her, and this one looked like it would fit the bill.  Below are my ... well, her ... impressions.<br /><br />- All of the chocolate treats are of good quality.  By that I mean there are no cheap chocolate fillers.  And there was a decent variety of items to sample.<br />- Some of the boxes don't have nearly as much product inside as the size of the container would suggest.  However, she tells me that the amount of treat for each was just right, enough to be satisfying, and gave her a good sample of the item.<br />- The gift basket was presented well, and was attractive.  The contents rested on shredded purple paper inside of a red tin basket, was enclosed in cellophane, and tied with a bow at the top.  She intends to re-use the tin basket when making a gift for another occasion, so it's not cheap looking or junky.<br />- While a little on the pricey side, when you consider the quality of the treats and the overall presentation, I would say this gift basket is worth the money.<br /><br />Taste in chocolate is like taste in wine ... it can vary widely between individuals.  While none of the treats here struck her as "Omigosh, get me more of this!", she liked them all, and appreciated this as a gift.  Four stars.

review/summary: Great for a chocolate lover
review/text: I gave this as a gift to a favorite cousin who is an admitted "chocoholic". She reported that there was nothing included that was "throwaway". All the products first class and the kind of truffles, chocolates, cocoa and so on that a true lover of the bean likes.  Quantities were sufficient to give you a decent taste of each one.  I had become discouraged with gift baskets that had a couple good items and a bunch of stuff nobody would love.  This one is not that way; actually safe--and satisfying--to send someone you really like!

review/summary: Concerned
review/text: I ordered the peanut oil and was excited about the purchase.  I was going to use the oil to fry a turkey with for thanksgiving.  When I received the package, the cap was partially on and the seal was broken. The oil had leaked out of the container.  I contacted seller and did not get a response until I filed a complaint with Amazon.  The seller than contacted me and told me to retract complaint and they will resolve the problem.  I wanted another container of oil, but they refunded me my money.  That is nice, but it's hard finding peanut oil in certain areas of the United States and at such short notice.  I have ordered from company in the past and will probably order from them again.  I think they should respond to customers issues in more timely manner.

review/summary: Eaters beware!!
review/text: Because this thing is sooo sinfully delicious, any eater is very likely to go through the entire pouch (contains maybe 7-8 joined cashew pieces) in one sitting. And that, according to the nutritional information printed on the back, equals about 940 calories and almost 66 gms (100% of R.D.A.) of total fat and 11 gmss (66%) of saturated fat. My point is this is not a healthy food by any meaning of that word. Also, each pouch has about 22 gms of sugar, which is why I gave it only 4 stars. I think it still would have tasted just as good without that sugar.<br /><br />That said, it is still better than eating most junk snacks that are laden with god knows what and how many artificial abominations. The thing I like the most about this cashew product is it is dry roasted, unlike most brands you find on the supermarket shelves which are fried in oil. Nuts are naturally oily/fatty; there' s no need to deep fry them in oil again. Besides, I think nuts taste better in their raw forms.<br /><br />Finally, I think the label in the package is a little misleading. It reads the product is "Vegan, cholesterol-free, dairy-free, and wheat- free." But, isn't that self-evident? It's like saying bottled water is fat and sugar free.

review/text: I loved Mrs. May's Cashew Crunch. What I didn't love about it was the nutritional information. The pieces it is cut into are very small. They are easily popped into the mouth and in a crunch or two they are gone. So consuming the entire pouch is VERY easy to do! ONE OUNCE of this has 172 calories! 12 grams total fat (2 grams Saturated Fat)! Once ounce is gone so quickly that you'll easily overdo it. This snack may be made with healthier ingredients than the garbage you can buy at the local store but it is in no way healthy to eat this snack. I love it but I'll never eat it again.

Considering Mrs. May's markets itself as a healthy product, I was shocked when I glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in China. China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now we're supposed to trust them making our health food?<br /><br />Not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world. I will not buy this product anymore.<br /><br />I would rather purchase the Sahale snacks that are made in the US, even if they are a bit more expensive.

review/text: I was a Mrs. May's regular for years.  I ordered a case of their cashew crunch directly from them and it arrived in a box that said:  Made in China.  I wrote them and, to give them credit, unlike most American companies today, they responded honestly and without the typical excuses. They told me they'd produced their products in China for years with no problems.  My dogs were affected by the Chinese dog food poisoning incident and I did not want to subject my family to the possibility of tainted food purchased in the belief I was giving them something healthy. Also, the fuel used to ship these from China to the U.S. makes them less than viable candidates for sustainability. I already work very hard to ensure than things purchased on Amazon come from areas near my home.

review/text: Kiwaii water is by far the best tasting spring water I've ever had!  My entire family loves it.  No other water has such a clean and pure taste, leaving no aftertaste at all.  The bottle caught my eye at first and after I went on the company's website and read more about it--I was totally sold!  After my first bottle of Kiwaii, I knew I'd never drink anything else!  We used to drink Fiji water in the past, but Kiwaii simply tastes much better and I'd rather purchase water from a company where integrity and honesty to their customers is completely important to them.  And that is Kiwaii 100%!  We've ordered it from Amazon several times and it's been a very easy and positive experience.  It's also great that we can purchase it in other stores around our area.  I would highly recommend this spring water to everyone!

Since that time, I have put Kiwaii on the top of my list.  I think it's taste is far superior to Fiji, Voss or any of the other waters out there.  It tastes clean and refreshing.  My entire family including 3 small children only want to drink Kiwaii if they have a choice.  We don't always drink bottled water, but when we do, the clear choice is Kiwaii.  Give this water a try, there is no going back!

I just went back on Amazon to check the item details and these same noodles, sold by a vendor, are now $87.14 a case, or $7.26 each!! (Nutricity) So, watch the pricing! (Prices are rising, but this is ridiculous!) If Amazon is NOT the shipper, you will pay way too much! As for the noodles, they are $5.99 a bag in our local stores, and also on Amazon, if you buy INDIVIDUAL bags. But these are not your average store bought egg noodles  - they are WAY better! These HEARTY egg noodles are better, even, than homemade! You will LOVE them! They are tasty, firm, and never cook up mushy. (You will have NO problem using up a case of them!) Recommended!

review/summary: 4.5 Stars for Ease of Use, Availability and Taste
review/text: I admit I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to hot spicy things. For that reason, lots of times I end up not liking hot wings which can be disheartening after you've gone to all the expense and work to create the wings. With this packet, I get the spicy flavor without so much of the heat.<br /><br />I've used McCormick's Buffalo wing mix on boneless tenders, wings and legs and always had good results. You just coat your chicken pieces and place in your pre-heated oven. Super easy!<br /><br />The only downside is if you like the skin on your chicken to be crispy, then it's a bit hard to do with this because it tends to brown/blacken somewhat easily both in the oven - I tried to crisp using the broiler in the oven - and out on the grill. You can get it a little crispy but you have to watch it like a hawk because one second it'll look fine and the next, it's blackening.<br /><br />Bottom line: Tastes really good without being horribly hot, easy to use and I can even find it in the small town I live in.

review/summary: Fabulous Wings!
review/text: Wings made with this seasoning are perfect; so delicious! A few prep. ideas: 1. Coat your wings  in a reusable container, not a plastic bag. 2. Line the baking sheet with oiled parchment rather than aluminum foil; better results, easier clean-up. So good; not too spicy. Glad it's available through Amazon because it's becoming hard to find at the store. Yum!

review/summary: 7 Grain Cereal my favorite!
review/text: I have been using this cereal for breakfast for about 6 months now, and I love it. The only drawback is the cook time. I have had the best results using 1 part cereal (1/4 cup) to 3 parts water (3/4 cup) in a tall bowl. Nuke for 12 minutes at 30% power.<br /><br />It lends itself to mixing in a variety of other foods. Currently I am mixing in about 1/4 cup plain fat-free yogurt, applesauce, a bit of canned pure pumpkin, and berries. I have used flavored yogurt and other fruits as well. Very tasty and quite filling. Good for the body as well, who could ask for more?

review/text: For those who are trying to watch their diet and adhere to the DRV values it is a great product. It has and enormous amount of fiber, almost no sugar. I make it with chicken as a side dish or for breakfast with raisins and/or peaches. Takes about 10-15 minutes to make on the stove top, I did not try to make it in the microwave. Make sure you stir it once in a while especially by the end of cooking when the water has almost evaporated completely.

review/text: Until Twining's decided United States customers who enjoyed their Traditional English Breakfast Tea were not important and no longer worth the effort (yes, I know you can still buy their Breakfast Tea for Americans in the Orange tin, but not the traditional) I was not familiar with Ahmad Teas.  As I was searching for a quality replacement I tried this tea and Eureka!  It is an ideal Traditional English Breakfast Tea.  I have since also tried and thoroughly enjoy Ahmad Traditional Afternoon Tea and Ahmad Evening Tea (Decaffinated).  I am delighted there is a vendor actively interested in bringing quality teas to American tea drinkers.  As for that other vendor?  Oh well, to the dustbin of history with them.

review/summary: From Cane Grown in Volcanic Ash
review/text: I first found this sugar while working at Larry's Market in Seattle. The India Tree company is also located in Seattle. It was one of the greatest food discoveries I'd forgotten about. Well, not quite. I just had no idea why the sugar we ate in Africa was so rich and similar to molasses in color. This sugar is milled on the island of Mauritius off the coast of Africa and has the divine flavor only possible from cane growing on volcanic ash.<br /><br />Here in America, most of the brown sugar seems like white sugar coated in a brown coloring in comparison to this rich, dark and almost seductive slightly salty tasting sugar. When I found this sugar, it brought back tons of childhood memories. Mostly memories of eating a spoonful of sugar as a treat. This sugar is "that" good.<br /><br />Muscovado is slightly moist, has a very high molasses content and is delicious in gingerbread, coffee cakes, chocolate cakes and anything with chocolate in it. You can basically use this sugar in any recipe that calls for "dark brown sugar."<br /><br />When making cookies, you will notice some of the lumps don't quite work themselves into the dough. This is no problem, because then you just find a few sugar lumps in your cookies. If you prefer your sugar to be perfectly soft, you can add a piece of apple or bread to your sugar jar until the sugar softens.<br /><br />This is one of my "Top Ten" ingredient finds of the century.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Cat loves it
review/text: My 2 year old male cat was eating Wellness canned for most of his life but then got diarrhea so I had to put him on a bland diet of boiled chicken for a little more than a month. I tried switching him back to Wellness but the diarrhea came back so I have decided to try a new food. He never really ate the Wellness food with enthusiasm but loved his boiled chicken so I tried to find something as close as possible to JUST chicken (with the vitamins he needs of course). I've done a ton of research and Tiki Cat came out on top due to its nutrition, grain-free, no preservatives, low ash, etc. I just started switching him to this today, and I am already so impressed with the Tiki Cat food. It literally smells and looks like something we would eat (it is human grade)!<br /><br />He ate this so fast and loved it so much, I thought he might throw up after. He left some of the boiled chicken behind but each bite of the Tiki Cat is gone. It makes me happy to be feeding him something so healthy that he loves so much.

review/summary: Awesome cat food
review/text: I agree with everything the previous two reviews have said.<br /><br />One of my cats has stomatitis - her teeth and gums are chronically inflamed, making it difficult for her to eat most canned foods (since most canned cat foods are mushy and stick to her teeth like peanut butter). The texture of this cat food is different - it comes in little shreds or strips, making it much easier for her to eat because nothing gets stuck to her painful, painful mouth.<br /><br />Also, the manufacturers will send you detailed nutrition information (down to the exact calories and milligrams) if you email them!<br /><br />Sidenote - all but maybe one or two of TikiCat's varieties are very low in phosphorus, making them super awesome for cats with kidney issues.

review/summary: Another quality food from Tiki!
review/text: I bought quite a few of the tuna varieties plus the 72 can packs of chicken and of salmon and wanted another kind of chicken to alternate for my cats dinners.  I bought one case of this to make sure my pickiest cat would like the egg in it and gave it to them last night.  It was a big hit so I'm back to take advantage of this sale.  Kind of funny that the real sale is with the single case other than the larger amount, but as long as I get the best deal I don't care.  (6 single cases which is equal to the 72 pack is only 85.68 versus the 91.87 for the 6 pack) My cats are loving this food and I intend to keep buying it for them.

review/summary: Packed full of chicken and egg
review/text: This can is absolutely jam-packed with small bits of shredded chicken and a few little cubes of egg.  The food is moist, but there is very little fluid in the can.  I was surprised at how much food it seemed to be when dumped onto a plate; it seemed to "expand" to more then the typical plateful from a 3.3 oz. can.<br /><br />A freshly opened can smells like chicken - nothing more.  It looks and smells better than canned "people food" chicken!<br /><br />Our cats typically eat Weruva, but picked some of this up to try; they have licked the plates clean each time it is fed and seem to really enjoy it. They seem to have a slighly easier time with the size and texture of the Tiki Cat chicken - or, at leas, they make less mess when eating it.  We always find stray bits of Weruva chicken on the floor after feeding that food. Our cats have not had any stomach-related adjustment problems, either.<br /><br />This company also has an informative webpage with clear nutritional facts about their product.  From what I can tell, it looks like a safe, high-quality, low-carb, high protein cat food option; a good pick for pretty much any kitty with healthy kidneys.

The coffee is clumpy inside the bag which may indicate it has been on the Amazon shelf for a while longere than maybe it should be and there is no sell by or best before date on the bag to provide any further data.<br /><br />Unfortunately this appears to be the only 100% Kona Coffee available from Amazon so the only alternative is to order it drect from a seller in Hawaii (the prices are about the same) but you do have to pay for the shipping.

review/text: You can get better tasting Kona coffee than the price I paid. Roughly 26 bucks for a pound The real reason I got it was it could be shipped with Amazon prime. If this is the reason you want it. It is not bad but next time I will wait for better coffee at the same price. It has a slightly bitter taste. Tastes better than what I would get at starbucks or the supermarket but if you are wanting to duplicate  your memories of Kona coffee go elsewhere. Packaging is a big plus for this product though, for those of us that are too lazy to grind our own beans.

review/summary: Gorgeous, rich black tea
review/text: I was highly recommended to stop at Bewley's Cafe while I was in Dublin, and was definitely not disappointed. The lingering memory of the visit was the gorgeous tea I had for breakfast. I didn't get a chance to buy some while I was in Ireland, and was so excited to find that I could purchase it through Amazon. I've given a few bags to friends and family, and all have been very impressed with the taste. This tea has a very nice, smooth taste, and not nearly as strong or bitter as most breakfast teas I've tried. It's very refreshing in the mornings, even when I "ruin it" with a splash of milk and a little honey.

review/summary: Bewley's is the best
review/text: While in Ireland last summer, I drank Bewley's tea at the B&B in Kilkenny and bought a box at Dunne's to bring home. Those bags ran out long ago, so I ordered some online. Drinking Bewley's is like being back in Eire, walking in the garden smelling the lavender and loam. As soon as you drop the bag in the hot water, it begins to swirl a rich, dark brown, and in only a minute you have a wonderful cup of aromatic, flavorful tea.<br /><br />I've ordered from Bewley's before - hampers last time - and have not been disappointed. I was glad I could order though Amazon [...]. At last, I've found a place where I can order black pudding. If you want a taste of Ireland, get some Bewley's.

review/summary: Great For Homemade Pasta
review/text: I make homemade pasta every Sunday and I recently gave Bellino Semolina a try.  I was really impressed with Bellino's Semolina flour when making linguini.  Normally when making pasta with a hand crank roller and cutter I need to use half Semolina and half white flour but with Bellino I was able to skip the white flour all together.  It's easy to work with, has a great consistency and has a great taste.  I highly recommend this product.  The ingredients I use for my homemade pasta is one bag of Bellino's Semolina flour, 4 extra large eggs, 4 tablespoons of Olive Oil and 1 teaspoon of salt.

review/summary: it works
review/text: this stuff looks like fine grits but it works, it totally smoothes out when the water, egg, ex.  is added to make pasta. each bag has about 2 and 3/4's cup of the flour.  prepared with the one egg one cup and splash of water, it works great and makes a smooth pasta that is exactuly like store bought plain pasta; it is indistinguishable to me, aside from the slightly ill regular shaped noodles  b/c i rolled it out with a rolling pin and hand cut.<br />advantages; the cheapest stuff i could find.  1.50 off+ free shipping for sighing up for auto send.<br />disadvantages; you need to order a lot even to "play" just a little, because the bags are small.  there is not a recipe for pasta on the package. The price it still higher then if you bought already made pasta. currently you have to buy 4 bags at a time.<br /><br /> one cup recipe makes about three large hand fulls of flat cut pasta. so one bag makes a little more the say 8 large "side servings".

review/summary: A lot of flour!
review/text: I bought this to use in place of corn meal on the pizza peel and stone when I make pizza. I had heard that semolina flour wouldn't burn like cornmeal, and I can definitely attest that it doesn't leave an acrid flavor or smoke up like burnt cornmeal would in my 550 degree oven.  It works great as a pizza lubricant, but I have yet to try it in homemade pasta (which I hope to do soon).  These came well packed and was actually significantly more flour than I was expecting (comes out to over 4 lbs. total between the packs).  But the packs are really hard to get open without spilling flour everywhere, as they are vacuum packed really tightly and seem to "explode" if I am not super-careful when I cut them open.  And the flour seems to kind of clump together and needs a pretty thorough sifting before it can be used.  But considering that I couldn't find coarse-ground semolina in any of my local supermarkets or Whole foods, it was well worth ordering off of amazon.

review/summary: The Real Thing!
review/text: I am just learning to bake bread because we are living in a small US city this year which, while it has a terrific local cuisine and lots of organic ingredients and bakeries, did not have any authentic tasting semolina bread, which happens to be my favorite.  I found a recipe online and thought I'd give it a try.  I already knew from long experience that it was always best to buy dry pasta that was "made in Italy" if you wanted the best taste and texture -- US made pasta has a tendency to go from undercooked to overcooked mush in less than a minute -- Italian pasta is more forgiving.  Anyway, for my first batch of dough, I used this Bellino semolina and, while it wasn't perfect (I needed to make many adjustments in the recipe due to the very high altitude here), the taste was really good, very authentic.  For the next batch, I used a bag of Bob's Redmill(?) semolina because I found it at the local Whole Foods store.  The first two loaves I baked were so tasteless compared to the original ones I made, and I couldn't understand why since I had finally gotten the texture right in spite of the high-altitude complications.  Then I remembered that the Bellino semolina was from Italy, and the Bob's stuff wasn't.  Indeed the dough looked fine, but when I tasted even the raw dough, it lacked the rich creamy taste of real semolina.  My advice: don't mess around with semolina that's not from Italy if you're making pasta or bread!  Just like New York bagels, you really can't get the right result if you don't have ingredients from the right place.

I own one of the top "normal size" stand mixers and for the first time it overheated on the lowest setting following all directions. And the result was a fairly good tasting noodle with the consistency of rubber. I used up my order by mixing it 1/3 to 2/3 cheapo semolina from the local mediterranean food stores. The result was acceptable, but we prefer the cheapo local stuff. No buring up a very good mixer and still getting rubber noodles

It is as bold as the expresso I am used to without the bitterness. I take my coffee black so this element is important. Soo - for those who like their coffee like me, dare to try this one. It will be worth it.<br /><br />Oh and JC Penny sells it. Therefore, if you have their card or are suscribed to their emails you can easily get coupons from 15% upto 10.00 dollars off to use toward coffee purchase.<br /><br />Enjoy!

Simply put, when I would visit the states again, all the chocolate tasted like wax, no body, no richness, almost like plastic....So, now that I have returned, how can I get those same big bars that haven't been "corrupted" by US chocolate makers that branded it here then "altered" the recipe?  Well, I found these Lindt bars on Amazon from the seller above and was delighted to receive REAL Swiss chocolate, un-melted, well packaged and in just a few days!  So, now I can get that great chocolate you normally only find in Duty Free shops right online.  If you are a lover of untainted, real Swiss Lindt chocolate, then this is the place to get it!  I will definitely be back for more.

It was overly salty and the worst part is, why does it include something artificial, specifically, Vanillin?<br /><br />For the price it usually costs, how can they use something artificial. I expect this in cheaper chocolates like Milka but not Lindt Swiss Premium Milk Chocolate. I actually accepted the salty taste and thought it just not to my specific taste, but I couldn't let the artificial ingredient go.<br /><br />I have to give this two to three stars depending on my mood, it was disappointing.

review/summary: better than Frappucino -- WOW!!!
review/text: I was very skeptical when first trying the Iced VIA, particularly since, as another reviewer noted, the addition of sugar (NOT Splenda, alas) to the mix is clearly stated on the package.  Howver, this product turns out to be a huge win for me.  First of all, unlike the regular or decaf VIA which I also love (see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00451WLYI">Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee, Decaf Italian Roast, 3-Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a>), a single serving packet makes 16 oz., not 8 oz -- in other words, you get twice as much.  Second, if you just add a little milk or half and half (I use 4 Mini-Moos for one 16 oz. serving) plus a squirt of your favorite chocolate syrup, it's better than a Mocha Frappucino, and at a fraction of the price for a larger serving than even the large size bottles.  Even though it's now no longer summer, this is still my favorite way to start the day.  I'm saving a lot of money by no longer buying Frappucinos, not to mention the effort of lugging a case home from Sam's Club every week.  And the sugar content is LOWER than that of a Frappucino -- even if you add your own chocolate -- which pleases me.  In fact, a Mocha Frappucino out of the glass bottle now tastes too sweet to me.<br /><br />Amazon is apparently getting ready to offer a 50-pack case of Iced VIA, which is fabulous news -- I can't wait!  :)<br /><br />P.S.  To make it easier to prepare, I keep several recycled 16-oz. plastic water bottles in the fridge.  Each time I want a new 16 oz. cup of Iced VIA, I use one bottle, then refill it with tap water and return it to the fridge.  No need to use a measuring cup or fuss with ice -- the chilled water is always waiting for me and makes a perfect iced coffee each time!

review/summary: The classic!!
review/text: Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation."

review/summary: Safe for adults and children of all ages!
review/text: If you have a small child who is hard to get to bed at night, put them in a routine. Make them some sleepytime before bed (you can add splenda or honey to make the tea sweeter). This will calm thier nerves and make for a restfull night of sleep. This has also shown to me to prevent a fight from a child who does not want to go to bed. With a cup or two of this tea they should be off to sleepyland.<br /><br />This tea does have a distinct taste which can be hard for some to get used to. I add honey or splenda to my tea to calm the bitter taste down. This tea is like chammomile - with little to no taste. So you'll need to add lemon juice or honey to make this tea taste good.<br /><br />This tea can also calm you after a hard days of work if you've been over worked or stressed out.<br /><br />I give this tea to friends and loved ones who are going through stress, or issues to remind them to relax.
