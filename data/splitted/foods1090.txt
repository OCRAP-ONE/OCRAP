Exaggerated it may sound but I eat it breakfast , lunch and dinner..sometimes even before going to bed. I add slices of bananas with it and i'm in heaven. I'm just addicted and no regrets..I just believe it's healthy too even if I splurge on it.

review/text: I have egg and nut allergies and am a big fan of Cherrybrook products - well, some of them - others taste like chalk.  This isn't one of them.  These cookies are so good we actually had people (without allergies) ask for the mix so they could make them at home.  I guess that is a pretty big ringing endorsement.  People without allergies actually choose to eat these.

review/text: This cookie mix is outrageously yummy.  It's so much better than any vegan cookie recipe out there.  I enjoy them more than a regular cookie.  We make them with Earth's Balance to keep it vegan and they turn out so great.  The texture is normal, like a regular toll house cookie even though no eggs, dairy or butter are used.  Our guests have loved them and have no idea they aren't a regular recipe.  Best find for my son who has allergies.  The ingredients are pure and simple without a bunch of unhealthy filler.  We love this cookie mix.

No one could believe how good it was, especially since I (a horrible baker) made it!.<br /><br />Another fabulous thing about this is that if you are a "cookie dough eater" - you are able to eat it safely since there are no eggs added.<br /><br />Jude the Dude Children's Book on Peanut Allergies <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981623506">Jude The Dude: The Peanut Allergy Kid (Volume 1)</a>

review/summary: THE BEST Gluten, Dairy, Egg free cookie mix - Yum!!!
review/text: We've tried pretty much all the various gluten free mixes and from scratch GF recipes, and have been disappointed with pretty much all of them.(we also need egg & dairy free, so often have to modify the other mixes/recipes to do this) I was absolutely amazed at how great these cookies turned out! I added some coconut shreds (tiny ones, not the big stringy ones) and these cookies were fabulous!They look like regular cookies, taste like regular cookies & have a normal texture. Someone who didn't know they were gluten free would think they were regular, super yummy cookies!<br /><br />For some reason, many Gluten-free mixes give me a very upset stomach (although hubby and daughter are fine) and Cherry brook did not. I'm amazed that the best tasting mix also turned out to be the best for not causing stomach upset! Yay! If you have this problem with GF mixes also then absolutely try the Cherrybrook!

review/summary: classic taste is back!
review/text: When I was a teenager, I had a terrible addiction to Big Red. I don't know why- I'm not a fan of spicy and am not drawn to cinammon or anything like that. There's just something about this gum that makes me want to chew it all day.<br /><br />I sort of moved on from my addiction, but a decade or so I bought a pack just to keep in my bag for post-lunch-breath-refreshing and the gum was AWFUL. I found out that Wrigley's had replaced the sugar with artificial sweeteners and the results were disasterous. If I wanted sugar free gum, I'd buy Trident or every other brand on the planet. I just wanted that sugar-y, crispy stick of Wrigley's gum.<br /><br />Then a few years ago I bought another pack out of sheer desperation after eating a slice of pizza and was surprised to find that the flavor was back to how it was when I was a kid. Wrigley added back some of the sugar, but kept some of the artificial sweetener, as well.<br /><br />The end result is a longer lasting flavor, which is nice, although I really do have to stop myself from putting in a fresh piece every four minutes to get the flavor hit.<br /><br />I know chewing gum is sort of a bad habit, but it's better than some other things I could do when I'm nervous or working (chewing gum helps me focus, I don't know why...) or have a garlic-y lunch. I'm glad Wrigley realized not all of us want our gum healthier. I just want that classic Big Red taste and I'm glad it's back.

review/text: Bouncy little chews, more latexy and less waxy in texture than Starburst or Mamba. The flavor is startlingly like real mango, with even a hint of peel, more like biting into a juicy mango than eating the usual very intense fruit-flavored kind of candy. A light, refreshing, not-to-sweet flavor that's really special. I like every flavor of Hi-Chew I've tried, but mango is my favorite and the most unusual.

review/summary: mango hi-chew
review/text: Oh mango hi-chew, how I wished I liked you.<br /><br />I love hi-chew a lot and I really wanted to try every flavor thinking I would love them all.  BUT mango hi-chew... I just can't feel the love.  First off I want to say that I love hi-chews because I find them to be milder and less sweet than starburst and I think a better chew.  Also I want to say that there is really nothing wrong with the mango hi-chew if you really really really love super ripe mangos.  Now I would say that I really do like mangos but not the super ripe mangos, I like it while it still has a little of a sour taste and the texture is more solid basically when it's sort of a yellow-orange color.<br /><br />If you love love super ripe mangos, where you wait for it to get really soft and it gets to that dark orange color and basically can eat it with a spoon because it melts in your mouth, than you will love this mango flavor because that's how the exactly captured it.  I'm not a big fan of that but my manager loves mangos like that, so I earned some big brownie points by giving him the rest of my mango hi-chew.  He really loved it, he ate the whole package (minus the one I ate) in about 2 days.  That's really eating fast!<br /><br />So even though I don't really love the flavor it was still a well made flavor and I felt the captured the taste of a really ripe mango well, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars still.

review/summary: Lucky?
review/text: I was lucky to read the first customer's feedback about the discrepancy between the number of Bags advertised compared to what he actaully received. I called Amazon Customer Service BEFORE I ordered to discuss the misrepresenation and seek corrective action for the previous customer AND myself in advance.<br /><br />Well, I ordered and received NINE bags as advertised - yippee! It's just that 3 of the bags were nearly FLAT compared to the remaining 6 bags which seemed pleasingly plump. I did open a flat bag upon arrival. The product was tasty and fresh and seemed to contain an appropriate amount of product just 50% broken chips. I'm not about to immediately open a plump bag to see if it's more air than product or the condition, but will update when I do. At about 2 bucks a bag a decent buy.<br /><br />The shipping package came very well packed with air cushions surrounding the box containing the Ritz Toasted Chips without dings. This leads me to believe the issue is with NABISCO and their packaging. This is my second disappointment with NABISCO products I've received through Amazon. I'm now wondering if NABISCO is selling less than perfect items through Amazon. If so, it should be noted and priced accordingly so we can make an informed decision.<br /><br />So I guess I'm lucky I didn't receive another buggy surprise BUT I'm not sure I'll buy NABISCO products through Amazon again. I hope you'll be lucky!<br /><br />UPDATE: Inconsistent condition of individual bags and contents. Flat bags - busted chips, Puffy bags - perfect chips. Not sure what else to say about Nabisco and/or Amazon on this.

review/text: I agree with some of the other reviewers (for the NON-Classic syrup). I have been buying this product, mostly to add to coffee, for several years. At some point, I noticed that the flavor changed, and (to my palate at least), it was a change for the worse. After noticing some of the recent reviews, I made sure to order the "Classic" flavor when my supply started to run low. When it arrived, I taste-tested vs. the "non-Classic" syrup that I still had on hand, and (again, to my palate), the "Classic" tasted far superior. I suppose other people may prefer the new flavor, but for me, the Classic is the one I'll order from now on.

review/summary: Too Sweet and Odd
review/text: I had been using Monin Dark Chocolate and love and flavor.  Just for variety I ordered some AhLaska.  What a mistake!  AhLaska is way too sweet and it has some kind of odd overtone in the flavor.  Sorry to say, it is at the point that it ruins anything that I put it on.  So I'm giving up on the AhLaska and going back to Monin.<br /><br />To help you decide whether my review relates to you, I'll tell you about my taste preferences.  I like dark chocolate, not on the sweet side.  I like my coffee and tea with no sugar.  When it comes to ice cream, I like just about anything that's high quality and well balanced.  Vanilla, chocolate, fruits and nuts are all great for me.<br /><br />I hope this helps you with your selections.  Bon Appetit.

review/summary: This Stuff is Awesome!
review/text: In another life I worked at a Trader Joe's.  One of my favorite products there was a chocolate syrup that was sweetened with pure sugar (different from all the hfcs-sweetened goo out there).  That product was delicious.  I had to quit working there and move to a city where there was no Trader Joe's.  I really missed my Moo.  Ah!Laska is worlds better!<br /><br />I use it mostly on ice cream.  I'm sure it would be great in a variety of contexts, though I've read a couple of Amazon reviews that essentially recommend against using it for chocolate milk.<br /><br />Great not having to troll around trying to find this in a local grocery store.

review/summary: THE BEST!!
review/text: I have loved chocolate milk my entire life and bought this immediately when I found it in a local store. I was impressed with the simple ingredient list and that it is organic... but I was concerned that it wouldn't taste as good as the Hershey's syrup that I've happily used for years. For comparison, I made two glasses of chocolate milk - one with AH!Laska and one with Hershey's. Wow - the difference was unbelievable! The AH!Laska syrup makes THE BEST chocolate milk ever! The taste is oh so good... so smooth and rich. The chocolate milk made with Hershey's now tasted weird and even grainy to me compared to the chocolate milk made with the AH!Laska syrup. Sorry Hershey's... I am totally in love with AH!Laska syrup and will not be coming back.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: I really wanted to get a chocolate syrup for my sons to make chocolate milk with but hated buying hersheys because of the HFCS and other ingredients. Being in Alaska options were zero. So I ordered this off amazon in a 4 pack to save money hoping it was good and it is! We keep ours in the fridge, so maybe that's why, but it takes a few extra stirs to get it mixed well. But the flavor is great and I can rest at ease knowing (even though it's still sugary) at least it is organic and natural.

review/summary: Slight off taste
review/text: We ordered the Ah!Laska Organic Chocolate Syrup because it's organic and received generally positive reviews.  We find that it has a slight off taste - hard to describe, but it just didn't taste as good as we hoped or expected.  More noticeable when used full strength on ice cream; not so noticeable when used for chocolate milk.  We ordered the multi-bottle pack, so we will be using this for quite some time.  I don't think we will re-order it though.  Suggest that you order a single bottle first, if available.  Then you can decide whether you like its flavor or not.

review/summary: Should be AH-Mazing
review/text: Since going gluten free for medical reasons, we have really tried to clean up our eating act.  All of the fake stuff in Hershey's syrup just wouldn't do because we drink massive amounts of chocolate milk.  I teetered back and forth on whether to buy this or not because of the mixed reviews.  Glad I just decided to go ahead and buy it because it is amazing!  My sons didn't even notice the switch but I do have to say it has a much better flavor and is a bit sweeter so I have to use a little less than what I did of the Hershey's.  I wish the price was a little lower but as I have discovered, eating healthier now and paying a little more money is far better than paying for it in our health later :)

review/summary: So disappointed!
review/text: We use a lot of chocolate syrup in our house. We have 3 little boys who love their chocolate milk, but we try to buy mostly organic and avoid HFCS altogether so I was excited to try this organic chocolate syrup. Upon first taste I was SO DISAPPOINTED! Tasting it as-is on a spoon it doesn't even taste like chocolate at all! At first you notice that it is VERY (almost sickening) sweet, and then you notice that it's a little bitter with NO chocolate taste.  After a second and then a third taste I realized it tastes like molasses. I didn't want to taint my kids thoughts on the taste, so I didn't say anything and made them chocolate milk using the AH!Laska syrup. They were disgusted. Bummer. Now I'm stuck with 4 bottles of molasses tasting syrup that no one likes and I still need a good organic replacement for the Nesquick syrup we normally use. Nice try AH!Laska but this needs a LOT of work!!<br /><br />UPDATE: We tried it on ice cream and it was pretty good. Kind of like the cheap hot fudge sauce they use at fast food restaurants. It might take us a couple of years to use up 4 bottles, but at least we found a use for it! I previously gave it 1 star for our initial experience with it's taste. I now give it 3 stars since it taste good on ice cream but can't be used for our chocolate milk.

review/text: Use this syrup in my morning iced coffee.  Very good taste, no HFCS, and all good ingredients.  Only "problem" (if you can call it that) is it is a little on the thick side, so if you want it to assimilate into your iced coffee you will need a good tumbler that you can give a good shake to.  Aside from this, great product!

I ran out about a week ago and had to use Hershey's and it tasted AWFUL after drinking the Ah!Laska for so long. It's like $5.29 at my health food store for one bottle, so I buy the 4 packs here on Amazon. I WISH THEY WOULD KEEP THEM IN STOCK!!!!!!! Come on Amazon!!!!

review/summary: Excellent quality and affordability from a trustworthy company
review/text: We used to feed Innova kibble (made by Natura Pet, the same company that makes Heathwise) and were always impressed by its quality.  However, our dogs tended to put on weight quickly when eating it because it's pretty high-calorie, so we switched to Canidae about 5 years ago.  Well, now that Canidae has a new formula that caused gastric issues with one of our dogs, we've started feeding Healthwise.  As far as I am aware, this company was never involved in any of the recent recalls or had any quality-control problems, so we feel good about trusting them.  Our dogs' transition to Healthwise was easy, and after several months on this kibble both are in picture-perfect heath.  The other Natura Pet kibbles are pricey ($50+/35lbs at our local feed store), but at an affordable $33/35lbs Healthwise is nonetheless a solid product--absolutely no corn or by-products, good high-quality meats and whole grains, no fillers or junk, and all indications are that it's tasty too.  Hooray!

review/text: I've been researching lavende vs. lavender and you can do no wrong with this product. I could smell the lavender as I approached my mailbox from six feet away. Not in a bad way, but in a wonderful, deep inhale, great-for-summer kind of way. I was shocked because shipping was super fast and efficient - and I live in Hawaii, where it takes weeks for things to get there. It's a good amount to put in many bowls and places in different places of my house. The smell is not too overwhelming but incredibly fragrant. I'm a big skeptic of ordering things online, but everything with this product - from the shipping time to the quality of the objects to the little information sheet that came with it - was perfect.

review/text: This is Adagio's version of masala chai, and it's a very good rendition.  The flavor is a blend of spices, and while it's difficult to pick out individual flavors, I suspect all of the standards are in there (cinnamon, cardamom, clove, etc.)  The flavor is pleasantly spicy and complex, and this is my spicy black tea of choice.

I put two cans in my usual Pasta e Fagioli recipe, lightly rinsed, and simmered for about the last 30 minutes before serving. The beans dissolved very slightly which nicely thickened the soup.

review/summary: Greatest thing since sliced bread
review/text: I've been buying Trinidad Cookquick Refried Pinto Beans for over 2 years, and I have never been disappointed with the quality, and taste of these beans. They take only 5 to 10 minutes to prepare, which, in my experience, depends on your consistency preference when preparing the product. They taste excellent without additional seasonings, but they're fantastic when prepared to one's taste with added seasonings etc. I prepare them with jalepenos, cheese, and some chipotle seasoning to add a bit of a kick to them. They're even better if one adds just a little cooked chorizo and cheddar cheese. I've served these to guests as a side with dinner and as a simple dip. In my experience, every guest that has tasted and eaten these beans cannot distinguish these dehydrated refried beans from traditionally prepared refried pinto beans. In fact, my mother, who is Hispanic and regularly prepares refried beans from scratch, could not tell the difference. I highly recommend this product for its quality, flavor, price, and convenience. Again, they're fantastic.<br /><br />A side note worth mentioning: When I purchased these beans locally, the only store that carried them WAS Smart & Final. Unfortunately, the Smart & Final stores in my area can't stock their shelves fast enough to keep up with the demand.

review/text: I made a scratch coffee cake utilizing a mixture of this sugar with palm sugar from Thailand. The taste of the batter was incredible! Additionally, the crumb topping was a mixture of Big Tree's palm sugar with ginger root plus Billington's dark brown sugar, which has a deep and wonderful molasses flavor. My house church members who sampled this cake found it remarkable. They loved it, saying it was wonderful and rich. Beige/brown in its coloring make-up, the cake had a solid texture to it. The cake was made with goat butter and raw goat's milk, to boot, adding to its uniqueness. It will be one of my mainstay cake recipes and a cake to make and sell (if anybody's interested!!). I LOVE to make authentic cakes (which are always prayed over and blessed) using authentic ingredients, because mine are 'Cakes Like Grandma Made!'

review/text: The sweetness of the palm sugar is overpowered by the spice of the ginger.  This is good for savory dishes, but awful for everything else.  It is a shame because of the incredible digestive benefits from the ginger, and the low glycemic index of the coconut palm sugar makes this a healthful combination, but it is a virtually unpalatable ingredient.

review/summary: Delicious Marzipan with a Ginger Twist
review/text: It seems that marzipan is an acquired taste and, in any case, something that people I've informally surveyed have either a strong opinion on or confess they've never heard of.  Like many who love the stuff I was brought up on it, as a child being served seemingly molecule-thick wafers of the precious substance only on the holiest days of winter by my German relatives.  Honestly, I thought it must have been genuine Ambrosia; solid gold ingots would have been treated with less reverence.  I've lost some of the reverence my ancestors had, mostly due to lack of scarcity, but I do love it.  And, the Niederegger company in Lubeck, Germany makes the best marzipan in the known universe.  Period.  Yes, it's just almond paste, but those in Lubeck craft it so finely, with premium ingredients and such an incomparable texture that this really is marzipan that stands head and shoulders above any other.  With full acceptance of the fact that I am a partisan in this particular regard, I can say with reasonable certainty that if you don't like Niederegger marzipan, you're just not gonna like marzipan, period.<br /><br />This is the classic Niederegger flat bar, with their delectable marzipan surrounded by dark chocolate and infused with ginger.  Not just infused, there are actually full bits of ginger in the marzipan itself.  To me, the taste that comes through immediately is more the traditional marzipan-with-dark-chocolate and I feel likewise about the aroma.  But wait, what's that aftertaste?  There it is, that familiar spicy-burn in the back of the throat that is unique to ginger.  The ginger flavor of this bar is distinct but subtle; with real juicy bits of ginger lurking about in the marzipan, some bites will give you more kick than others.  The product that was shipped hadn't been sitting around on the shelf and was quite fresh - the chocolate firm and aromatic, the marzipan silky and smooth, and the ginger juicy and spicy.  The price was reasonable if shipping is free and beat my local source by a significant percentage; this is a premium item and though it is relatively easy to come by, it is still esoteric enough to occupy only a niche on the shelf, raising the price.  Bar-by-bar, it is much more expensive than a comparable chocolate bar from Pennsylvania.  (which I also love)<br /><br />As to whether you will love it or hate it, that depends both on whether you like marzipan to begin with and whether, if you do, you also enjoy additions to a familiar flavor.  (something akin to whether or not you like nuts in your chocolate chip cookies, I suppose)  I think they've done a great job of matching a very strong flavor - ginger - to their marzipan in the right balance.  While I found it interesting and well done, however, it probably isn't something I'll be going back to; I don't like nuts in my chocolate chip cookies, either.  So while I'll be sticking with the marzipan/dark chocolate combination, I think this variation with the ginger is worth a try.  If you don't like it, though, don't let it turn you away from marzipan in general.

The only issue that might arise is getting the powder to dissolve.  There will be lumps for a short while, however, that is the price you pay for having fewer additives/ emulsifiers.  I for one, would gladly sacrifice an extra minute of stirring for extra purity.<br /><br />I'm curious to try the milk bath but for the moment, I'm more interested in mashed potatoes and biscuits.

Sometimes I don't bake as much as I thought or I get another shipment before I'm finished with the last and I end up with expired or excess buttermilk. I put a capful or two of my son's tangerine baby bubble bath and shake some buttermilk in and get softer skin than with any of the bath products I've tried in the past.
