review/summary: We love Altoids!!!
review/text: We love these cinnamon Altoids!  While they are a very good breath mint, we use them mainly for flavoring our coffee and sometimes, tea.  One, in the bottom of the cup, or a few in the coffee/tea pot makes life more interesting!  Also, good with just a touch of hot cocoa, added along with Altoids, in coffee.  And yes, they are good in hot cocoa, too.  Very inexpensive, easy way to flavor coffee or tea, much cheaper than alternative.  Almost no calories, but big on flavor!  We've used these for decades!

review/text: The quality of the Cinnamon Altoids is excellent. The delivery was quick. The only MAJOR disadvantage is that I was unable to get these shipped to my home address in Canada. I had to get them delivered to an address in the US where I was going to be visiting. Major disappointment that I cannot get them delivered to my home in Canada but glad I was creative enough to find an alternative for this purchase. Not sure if I will be able to continue to order in the future, though.

review/summary: Cinnamon Altiods
review/text: Okay heres the deal. I am a smoker and when I can not have a smoke. I like to have a couple of the Cinnamon Altoids. Also after I smoke I like to chew on them to get rid of the "Smoke Breath". I have tried other products and they do not work like the Cinnamon Altoids. For some strange reason they do not sell them anymore where I live in Southern California. I thought they were being discontinued. So I came on Amazon and they have them so I bought a couple of cases of 12. I go through about a tin of them every two or three days. I have also cut down on my smoking also. I use to smoke over a pack a day. Now I am down to about a half a pack. When I have an urge to smoke I chew on about three Cinnamon Altoids and it takes the craving away. Yep you guessed it I am using the Cinnamon Altoids to stop somking. I figure by the end of October I will have been done with smoking altogether. THANKS CINNAMON ALTIOIDS MAKERS AND AMAZON FOR CARRING THEM.

review/summary: Cinnamon Altoids, rare?
review/text: I was disappointed when I went to my local Sams Warehouse to buy more Cinnamon Altoids.  I went to the candy isle and found ust about every other type of mint but no Cinnamon Altoids.  I then turned to an internet search to find the pink beauties.<br />Right from Altoids site I was linked to Amazon. As I looked at the price for the product, I was trying to remember how much I paid at Sam's for Cinnamon Altoids. I truly think the Amazon price was better than my fee based warehouse store. An added bonus was the free shipping and the earlier that expected delvery.  All in all...Yeah Amazon and Altoids (for partnering)... booo Sams Club, for not keeping items in stock!

review/summary: Is there Cinnamon in these?
review/text: I've been munching on these for about 2 weeks because the tin shows in nice big dark letters at the bottom of the lid "Cinnamon". I've recently been diagnosed with adult onset diabetes and read some urban legends that talked about the possible benefits of cinnamon helping to stabilize or lower blood sugar.<br /><br />One day I noticed in the lower left hand corner, in light gold lettering the words Artificially Flavored.  Now, why would you need to "artificially" flavor a cinnamon mint?  So, I went on a search for the true ingredient.  The first thing I noticed is that if I keep eating these I'm going to need to switch to the diet version since the first ingredient (and therefore the largest component) is sugar. Not a substantial amount (10 calories in 3 pieces) but still might as well cut it where I can.<br /><br />But then I move down the list and it doesn't say anything about cinnamon as an ingredient.  So, I like these but I can't find anywhere, on any website, that indicates that the "artificial flavor" has anything to do with cinnamon. I found one website that indicated that it also contain "natural flavors" but that's a man-made laboratory generated flavor made from "natural" chemicals so I'm not sure I'm filled with confidence on that end if I do find that on the label.<br /><br />So, if anyone can tell me if the Cinnamon Altoids actually contains cinnamon I'd appreciate it.  Until then I guess I'm stuck with sprinkling cinnamon (the real stuff) on my oatmeal in the mornings.

review/text: I thought I was imagining the aftertaste, so I searched the webs and hooray, I'm not crazy!  (At least in this aspect.)  It's like an onion-y taste.  Blech.<br /><br />Maybe it's a supertaster issue??  I also hate coffee and think tonic water tastes like supernasty poison, so I'm a probable candidate.<br /><br />Besides the aftertaste problem, the gum is only so so.  Great starting burst of flavor, then quick fading flavor.  I would recommend staying away from this one.

review/text: I had so much fun with Wilton's green Color Mist for a green alien party! Remember, it's a MIST, which means it sprays LIGHTLY, so keep that in mind when you want to add just a tint of color to your party foods. For example, it's a great mist for popcorn. I sprayed some of the Kettle Korn green and added regular colored Kettle Korn for a party mix, then added green M&Ms for a sweet and savory mix. The kids loved it. You could use Color Mist to spray marshmallows, white bread, potato chips and any other lightly colored foods to keep with your party theme colors.<br /><br />I'll use the pink color mist for my next party: a pink pirate party, mateys!

review/summary: Yuck!  Far too salty!
review/text: Same complaint I made elsewhere.  This product is so horribly salty I can't taste the seasoning.  I won't buy it again.  Now, I won't throw it away, though.  I'll use it as salt.  That's all it is.  It's just salt, and when I put on the appropriate amount of salt, I won't expect to taste any seasoning (despite the claim on the package that when it's salty enough, it's seasoned to perfection).  My partner says he used to use Tony's many years ago, and that something has changed.  Says it wasn't so dreadfully salty back then.

review/summary: The ubiquitous clear broth
review/text: In Chinese, Vietnamese, and Japanese restaurants I've always been served this delicous clear broth with onions floating in it.  I've always wondered what it was and if I could buy it in a store.  After having bought a packet of this item at my local Safeway I've determined that this is the one and same.  It tastes great and makes a good warm drink.  Adding a small amount of sliced up green onions makes it even better.  The only downside is its rather expensive at over a dollar a cup for what you get for free with a meal in many East-Asian diners.

review/summary: You'd better like fish to enjoy this soup
review/text: I, like another reviewer, wanted that delicious clear broth with mushrooms and onions in it in a japanese restaurant. This soup looks like it, but certainly wasnt the taste I was expecting, and didnt taste like the soup id get locally. Oh well. Regarding the actual taste, its most prominent flavor is fish. I thought it was too fishy, but I do understand people have different tastes so I wont knock its rating down for that.<br /><br />The reason I gave it only 2 stars is what I didnt taste or see. The next prominent flavor is soy sauce. Other then that, theres really not much to this soup. The mushroom and onion "flakes" (I would call them slivers) are small in number and dont contribute much. There were a total of 3 pieces of wheat which added very little. At over a dollar per packet I would say the value is pretty bad. Ramen noodles are cheaper then this, and you get more in the seasoning packet from those then this soup. I would have liked to see larger sized mushrooms and onion. It doesnt really look like the picture - my soup was some straight slivers the thickness of rice grains sitting at the bottom. They were pretty pathetic. I dont believe kikkoman is a "higher quality" and thus you get what you pay for. They could have included more dehydrated onions or scallion. I was disappointed.<br /><br />If you like fish, you might like this soup, but I didnt enjoy it and dont think its a good value. To me, I would call this soup "fish broth with added soy sauce". I just didnt get any of that "mmm!" umami flavor that I recognize. Im sure some people will really like the flavor of this soup, but I'd highly recommend trying to buy one packet locally so you can try it before buying in bulk. If you dont like fish, dont bother at all.<br /><br />Oh well, i'm going to try their miso soup next.

review/summary: For Your Child or Your Dog!
review/text: We originally bought this for Sadie, our 75-pound golden retreiver.  For a few months, she showed some interest in the cute, small, squeaking toy, gingerly taking it in her mouth like as it were her her little puppy (insert collective "awwwww" here).  However, after awhile she showed only sporadic interest in it. It appears she would much rather show her chops by chewing, biting , and "wrestling" with larger stuffed animals, such as a gorilla, her current favorite.<br /><br />HOwever, our now 90-something pound 10-year old boy loved this when we first bought it several years ago. The hedgehog is soft and cuddly. It's a perfect take-to-bed size, and probably costs less than stuffed animals designed specifically for children. So, for either your dog or your child, the hedgehog is sire to find a loving and/or biting home.

review/text: I bought this toy for my English bulldog because he loves toys that make noise when he chews on them.  He can't get enough of them, to the point that it dives me nuts!  The toy only makes a low-pitched, quiet, barking noise.  After he got this, he could make noise with it all day and it would never bother me.  I found that it wouldn't even wake people up when he was making noise with it right outside their bedroom door.<br /><br />This is a great toy if you want something to make noise, but something that isn't annoying.

review/summary: Normal'na, hodna pol's'ka korivka
review/text: To say, the price is a bit higher, than at Miami Russian Store, where I bought several bigger bags of this fudge for ~$3.50 each, now if you calculate, this seller ships 9 small 180g bags per order = 1.6 kg. It is $16.25 per kg which isn't too bad if you live in the U.S. The quality is normal (middle-grade and higher). To say, I an a native Ukrainian, and if you ever go to Ukraine, I recommend you to try Roshen's "Korivka" - that's some great cream fudge: their texture will be smooth, like jelly and the sweets just melt when you put it in your mouth. These "Milanowek" fudges aren't as great as the Ukrainian ones, but they are still good. Especially if you can't buy fine quality cream fudge for it just isn't sold anywhere (here in the U.S.) I already purchased this candy 2 or 3 times, definitely will buy more. This is funny, but I eat the whole 9-pack box of this stuff in just 2 weeks.

review/summary: Great value
review/text: I have been enjoying Kookaburra Black Licorice for years and have purchased the product through many channels, including Kookaburra itself.<br /><br />I found buying in bulk like this presents the best value.  To provide such value, I believe some candy companies buy the 15.4 lb case from Kookaburra and then repackage it into smaller units.  This vendor seemed to present one of the best cost/oz values I could find on Amazon.<br /><br />One gripe some have found when buying repackaged product from candy companies is that the candy arrives stale.  Though that is a risk one takes for the sake of value, I would hope that an honest retailer wanting to keep a good reputation on Amazon would try to make good in order to ensure a repeat customer.<br /><br />Anyway, this product arrived fresh, so I have no reservations in recommending this supplier for Kookaburra Black Licorice.

review/summary: It's got that Cincy flavor !
review/text: Since you are searching this product on Amazon, it's safe to say you know the difference between "regular" chili and Cincinnati style chili , right ?<br /><br />Ok , that being established, this isn't Skyline . Or Dixie . But since those brands are like nine bucks a can plus shipping, I figured I'd give this one a try, at under $3 a can , shipped. It's kinda thin , but the flavor is there ...sweet , aromatic, and very much "Cincy" style.  I made a three-way ... served this over spaghetti noodles and topped with shredded cheddar, mmmm mmmm . My girlfriend liked it too, although being from Arizona, she doesn't think they should call it chili . They probably shouldn't , since it contains NO chili powder. I made another batch while on a camping trip with friends , and they gobbled it right up with rave reviews. One little kid called it "Christmas Spaghetti" and begged for it again the next night, I can see how the almost gingerbread-ish spice flavors reminded him of Christmas.<br /><br />Give it a shot if you want Cincy-style chili shipped your way , but don't want to pay big bucks . I think you will find this product fills the bill nicely !!

Based on the reviews, and the fact that it is much cheaper than the Skyline offerings, thought I would give it a try.  Used it for a three way chili.  I found it to be bland, thin, with much less meat than Skyline, and the taste was not great.  I tried to fix it up a little by adding some spices but it just couldn't be salvaged.  If you are craving Skyline, don't waste your money on this - you'll be as disappointed as I am right now!

review/summary: Great stuff, but just STUPID expensive here unfortunately
review/text: My favorite nearby Asian food mart is closing with plans to reopen months from now in a new location.  I need this stuff badly as a staple that must always be in stock, but I don't need it badly enough to pay nearly twice what it costs in a retail store, plus nearly double that again to have it sent to me.  I love Amazon so I hate it when Amazon is the worst possible place to buy a product, but there it is.<br /><br />I will look around for other sources because this stuff is AWESOME.  It has more fire than the relatively wimpy chili oils in the ethnic sections of mainstream US grocery stores, but you can control the burn factor by choosing how much to use in your recipe or as a condiment.  The flavor is subtle and isn't overbearing even if you load it on to increase the heat.  Very versatile and very good.

review/summary: Pearl is the Best
review/text: Years ago as my wife and I were becoming Vegan, we searched for a Soy Milk she liked. She was quite particular about how her "milk" tasted and as a result we tried all of the major brands. We finely stumbled upon Pearl Soy Milk at the local King Soopers. It has a very mild flavor very similar to milk in taste and mouth feel. we have been drinking it ever since.<br /><br />Kikkoman uses organic soy beans (very important) and is fortified with vitamins A, C and D2 and contains Calcium, iron, and Zinc.<br /><br />You can use Pearl anywhere you would use animal milk, it works just the same.<br /><br />Kikkoman's Pearl Soy Milk is in our opinion the best tasting soy milk on the market today. It's so much better than the Antibiotic, hormone and puss laden stuff they suck out of a Cows teats.

The flavor is wonderful, slightly sweet with a very mild and clean taste.<br />No aftertaste, long lasting on the shelf. you dont have to Refridgerate it till you open it,<br />when you do open and refridgerate it will last longer than cow milk before it turns.<br />I used to throw out half the milk i bought, didnt use it befor going bad, i have never had to throw any of this stuff out<br /><br />I use it with cereal or just a little by itself.<br />Havent tried it in baking yet so i dont know who it stacks up against cow milk.<br /><br />i buy this locally and have found it cost less than other brands

review/summary: Wholesome food at a reasonable price
review/text: We spent a lot of time checking out the various dog foods available.  We were trying to strike a balance between price and good quality ingredients.  We checked out some of the pricier brands which claim to be grain free, but I'm just not convinced that this is the way to go.  While they proudly announce that they don't have any grain fillers, if you read the ingredient list, you'll see that their fillers are things like potatoes.  To each his own, I guess, but Whole Earth Farms food is a great option for your dog. It's filled with wholesome, natural ingredients, at a price that won't break the bank.  Our husky puppy has done very well on this food, and we noticed an immediate improvement in his coat--it's so shiny and soft!  Huskies have sensitive stomachs, so once we find something that works, we stick with it.  Give this food a try--you and your puppy will love it!

review/summary: Grows great grass plus Bugs!
review/text: The grass grows quickly and doesn't make a surrounding mess like the catnip grown in dirt.  Directions say the seeds need replaced every two weeks although they can last 3-4 weeks in my experience.  The cat thought it was OK and did chew on it occasionally but he didn't seem overly impressed.  Unfortunately, this product attracts gnat like bugs within the first 10-14 days.  It is messy to clean out and reseed plus wasteful to spend $4 every few weeks for the refill.  I used the initial seeds and purchased a 2-pack refill kit.  After cleaning it out the first time, I waited a few weeks before trying again.  The second time I used a water sensor to make sure I didn't add more water than necessary and also left the seeds in for only two weeks but had the same results.  Limited cat response, lots of bugs, 10 minute hassle to clean.  Just wasn't worth while for me.

Just need to water as needed.[[ASIN:B004G9W4DC Catit Design Senses Grass Garden Kit.

They seem to need the greens even though lots of dry foods say they have it in the product - the cats just love eating the natural grass.

I really tried to have a positive attitude but, unfortunately, it just is not as good as McCormick's version.  The sauce did not have the same body and the flavor was very diluted compared to the McCormick product.<br />This will not keep me from ordering other ptoducts from Amazon but I will be much more selective in the future.

review/text: I have one dog suffering with a serious congenital illness and am not one who easily submits to medications.  Having had this dog under the care of a homeopathic veterinarian who has carefully instructed me on the pros and cons of different types of dog foods and treats, I highly recommend this product.  I've learned to be more aware and choosy of the ingredients in dog food and treats and find this product a healthy one.  We all need to be more aware of what we feed our pets these days and give them a fair shot at living a longer and healthier life.  My dogs love them but serve in moderation per the instructions.  They contain important heart supplements and will prove beneficial to the health of your dogs....so love 'em the right way....through the stomach!!

review/summary: Most is Well that's Dogswell
review/text: I've tried all the Dogswell products and my three mixed breed Malamutes like most of the products okay. They are less thrilled with the beef products than the chicken ones, which is odd, as they prefer most other brands' beef treats to the chicken counterparts. Happy Hips and Mellow Mutt seem to be their favorites, but they are fickle when it comes to this brand.<br /><br />What I like is that the product is manufactured under fairly stricy guidelines and with inspections so that while it is still Chinese Chicken, it is manufactured closer to US standards than many other similar products. You pay for this - but I love my dogs and I want them to be healthy and not exposed to too many frightening food stuffs (they find enough terrible things to ingest on their own).<br /><br />On balance, I think that this is one of the better chicken strip treats out there now. My dogs haven't become ill eating it and my vet says good things about it!

review/text: My dog is crazy about these chicken breast strips.  He can be a little finicky when it comes to his food and treats but will never turn down one of these.  Sometimes I'll give him a whole strip at once (although these definitely are not something that take my dog a long time to chew and he wolfs them down pretty quickly) or I will break up into smaller pieces to use for training or to fill his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y">Everlasting Treat Ball Large</a>.  They have a very strong scent and are very desirable to him so they make his treat balls and other treat filled toys extra appealing.  The only thing I do not care for with this treat is that they are made in China.  Given the recent health scare with dog food I would prefer if they were made domestically but so far my dog is doing very well with these treats as part of his diet.  Highly recommended.

In the end I ordered a whole duck fois gras made in USA.
