review/summary: Geat Taste & Healthy Too
review/text: We really enjoy this cereal. Not only does it taste great, but the ingredients are good for you too, particularly the black currants and walnuts.  The black currents are real black currants and not raisins as some manufacturers attempt to pawn off.  I highly recommend this cereal for the flavor and the healthy ingredients.

review/summary: Wonderful Flavor
review/text: I purchased this product because I thought it would be convenient to have on hand.  I live alone.  Each package makes six nice sized biscuits.  Water is the only ingredient to add.  What can be more simple?  I found I did need to add a little more water, but it may be because I live at a higher altitude.  The biscuits are light and taste great.  They do not even require butter, honey, or preserves.  They taste perfect all by themselves.  These are a nice accompaniment to a hot bowl of soup on a cold winter's night.

review/text: These packets are convenient and easy, a couple of spoons, 1/2 cup water mix and your are ready to go.  The honey butter taste is subtle, I usually like butter and jam on my biscuits but did not need any to supplement the flavor.<br /><br />I have used boxed bisquick for years, for whatever reason, these packets mix easier and are moister than using the standard bisquick recipie.

We should all call distributors and make a stink.  Now, I wanted to order them from Amazon again and they're not available.  My daughter wants more of them for her birthday.

review/summary: Good Cold Shipping by Amazon
review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

The four bags were simply shrink wrapped together and put in the box with my other items. I have only opened one bag so far but the M&M's were in great condition. Great price, delicious product, excellent service.<br /><br />Edit (10/01/10)- The price for these is now $35 more than when I bought them the first time. I can buy these for less than $10 a bag at the store. So the price is now closer to ridiculous then great.

review/summary: **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************
review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

review/summary: Not really into it.
review/text: So I'd like to start off by saying that I am a huge fan of the original Nuvo (aka the "pink one"). It's very sweet, just the right intensity, everything. I'm not such a fan of this new flavor, however. I guess everyone's different. If you're expecting the signature sweetness of the original flavor, you might be a bit disappointed with the lemon sorbet flavor. I'm not sure but my guess would be that they decided to market this version to please the customers that didn't like the original's sweetness. In any case, you won't like it if you're looking for the sweetness like I was. However, if you're after a pretty strong drink that's kind of tart and maybe a little bitter, you'll like it. I understand why people may go for this one, but I personally won't be buying it again. I prefer the sweeter original flavor.

review/summary: It's organic, but it changed my pie too much
review/text: I used this organic pumpkin in a pie this week.  Normally, I use Libby pumpkin, but wanted to try organic this time.  I prefer Libby.  This organic pumpkin from Farmer's Market really changes a pie.<br /><br />First, the entire texture is different.  It isn't nearly as smooth, and it is a bit dry.  The other ingredients are the same, so I know it's the pumpkin changing my pie's turnout.<br /><br />The flavor is also different.  Oddly enough, it doesn't have as much pumpkin flavor!<br /><br />Honestly, it makes my home-made pumpkin pie taste more like a cheap store-bought.  Really not nearly as good as when I use Libby pumpkin.  I'm say to say this, as I really prefer organic products, but when it changes the texture and flavor this much, I cannot recommend it.  Too bad I still have another can.<br /><br />If you do end up purchasing some to try, I'd recommend adding just a little extra sugar to your pie to help enhance flavors.  Add a little more cinnamon, too.

I also received free samples and the product is well packaged to ensure freshness.  This tea is delicious and I urge people to order from Lana's - there is a long list of tea flavors on her website!

review/summary: Absolutely Perfect Ginger Drink
review/text: This is the crispest, cleanest ginger beer I have ever had.  It says "fantastically fiery" and it is.  Not too, overpoweringly, ginger-y, but definitely not the watered-down, sugary mess you get in every other ginger drink in the U.S.  Can I give it a sixth star?  Hands down, WORLD'S BEST.

review/summary: Great ginger beer
review/text: If you've never tried ginger beer, it tastes a lot like a very intense ginger ale.  The ginger flavor is simply more pronounced than what you find in ginger ale.<br /><br />Barr's is not so sweet as some of the alternatives, which means you can drink it straight as well as mix it with vodka (Moscow Mule) or rum (Dark and Stormy).<br /><br />We bought a case to mix cocktails at a holiday party and it was a huge hit.  Locally, ginger beer sells for at least $12 for a six pack, so getting this product for less than $1 per can was great.  We'll buy Barr's from Amazon as often as we can.

It truly is Fantastically Fiery, not too sweet and so refreshing and satisfying it fairly dances on your tongue.  I'm not sharing my case with ANYONE !!

review/summary: Spicy ginger flavor
review/text: I had ginger beer for the first time on vacation in Australia. I enjoyed it very much, and was excited to find Amazon carried ginger beer. After reading reviews, I ordered Barr's and really enjoyed it. I found it to have a sufficiently strong, spicy ginger flavor. In contrast, the only ginger beer I have found in my neighborhood supermarket, Reeds Extra Ginger Beer, was quite disappointing. The ginger flavor was not as pronounced, and the lemon and lime flavoring detract from the ginger flavor. I mention this in case you have tried Reed's and enjoyed it, as Barr's may not be to your taste. I hope Amazon begins carrying the 24 case with prime shipping again, as I would like Barr's to become a regular treat.

review/text: This is a good Ginger Beer.  The can speaks to it being "fiery".  Well, it had a little heat.  What I liked about the GB was that it was not overly sweet so it did not add to the flavours of the drinks I mixed it with.  I also tried Cock n Bull, which was considerably more fiery but a little too sweet for mixing although a great GB for a stand alone drink.  I liked the price and the flavour so I will order again.<br /><br />I am looking for the hottest GB.  So far Fever Tree Premium Ginger Beer has been the hottest.  Anyone have any other recommendations?

My "Pack of 12" shipping/handling is about $7.80 (30.8% of the item cost) to a major US Metro area.

Amazon does do groceries - but at what shipping and handling cost?

review/text: I tried the Classic baked fries with kethcup.  Had I read the ingredients first I would never have bought them.  They are made from potato flakes like pringles and I have never liked Pringles.  These tasted odd to me and we had a houseful of company and a bunch of children under age 6 and no one liked them.  I crushed them up and put them under the bird feeder and only the chipmunks would eat them.  Nothing wholesome or good about these.  Back to my delicious Cape Cod potato chips, I will never wander away from you again!

review/summary: Snikiddy Southwest Cheddar Cheese Fries
review/text: This review is for the Southwest Cheddar cheese fries by Snikiddy.  I've tried the regular Cheddar cheese ones as well, but that's a separate review.  I do have to say, the Southwest is much better than the regular flavor.<br /><br />Snikiddy is an all natural brand.  They use better, pronounceable ingredients.  Although there still is corn content.  They claim they are gluten free, vegetarian, no msg and even kosher.  This particular flavor has ramped up spices in its flavoring mix.  It even has white pepper, which is unusual for a snack food.  But good!  There's jalapeno powder too.  So you can definitely tell they took the Southwest aspect of this snack seriously.<br /><br />I really liked the taste of this snack. Unlike the regular cheddar, it had a tastier cheese flavor.  But wow, was it ever spicy.  My nose started running while I ate it because it was so spicy.  But even with the spicy, you could still taste the cheese.  The texture was still a little chewy while eating after the initial crunchiness, but with a better flavor it wasn't as bad.  The spiciness is a little much at times, but definitely worth it for the flavor.<br /><br />I really did enjoy this particular flavor of Snikiddy fries.  And considering there are limited flavors of Snikiddy snacks in my area I'm glad I liked at least one of the flavors.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/text: I felt deeply motivated to say that I have to disagree with the reviewer who said these smell like old ketchup. I just didn't get that at all. To me, they smell like what they are. Disclaimer: I can't say I even know what old ketchup smells like. I'm kidding, but I do disagree and if I had read that review before trying, I may not have tried them.<br /><br />Anywho, found these at a local grocery store first. Took a chance on them and we were very surprised about how good they are, so I came here to buy them in bulk (quite a bit cheaper). They taste fresh and they don't leave me with a heavy feeling like the "andy capps" (or however you spell that) hot fries do. Super good snack and quite a bit heather than the others for sure. Every one we've shared them with ends up eating a bunch.

review/text: I learned about Zhena's Coconut Green Tea from, um, O Magazine.  I NEVER buy items recommended by magazines, since it is impossible to know whether something really IS good, or whether the recommender is simply making a bunch of money from the endorsement. But I love green tea and need to drink more of it because of its health benefits.  And yet, I find it a little... dull.<br /><br />So I indulged myself. And I am delighted that I did. Sometimes chai spices can be overwhelming. Those in Zhena's Coconut Green Tea (ginger, cinnamon, clove, cardamom, nutmeg, black pepper) are understated, smoothed out by the coconut. That the tea is organic and fair trade-certified seals the deal for me.<br /><br />I am going to stock up on Zhena's for Valentine's Day gifts, by the way, so don't buy it all!

My only complaint is that it is very expensive for the quantity. After buying these tea bags packaged in a can we bought the tea again in bulk packaged in a bag. It was much cheaper per pound to buy it in bulk.  I think with this product we mostly paid for the can not the small amount of tea inside.  At least it is a nice can and we have found a way to use it to store cat treats.

If you like other Oskri products, chances are you will like these.  Read the ingredients.  If you like all of them, you should like these.

review/summary: I wasn't expecting raisins in the product
review/text: I was really looking forward to having this little snack arrive.  However, when I tried it for the first time, I tasted an unexpected flavor.  After trying it a few times and then disecting it, I realized that there were raisins in it.  Unfortunately, no one in my family likes raisins.  After checking the list of ingredients on the website and the product package, there is no mention of raisins. Putting all of that aside, I think this product would be tasty to those of you who like raisins.  I must warn you that I think the presence of the raisins make this Pecan Honey Crunch more like Pecan Honey Chewy.<br /><br />Amazon's cutomer service was quick to respond and helped me fix the problem.  Thanks, Amazon!

review/text: As a distance runner finishing college, Gatorade can really hit the wallet hard. Luckily, I found NRC Sports on Amazon.com. It may seem like a lot to shell out for Gatorade at first, but when you realize you're getting Gatorade at $2.15 a gallon with shipping costs included, a smile begins to show.

review/text: I believe this is one of the Milo products that is NOT made in China. If I am wrong, please let me know! But my guy loves it and it is the one treat he knows by name and asks for every day. It's the one that gets him in his crate when I have to go shopping. It's the one he will roll over and beg for. No adverse reaction (unlike some of the other treats we have tried, including chicken jerky and sweet potato duck ones made in China which give him the runs). This one appears to be quite healthy for him and his poops are normal tootsie roll poops. So we are hooked!

review/summary: Great Cakes!
review/text: These cakes are fairly exploding with flavor and the kids love making charts depicting which flavors can be found under the robes of confection.  We order these at nearly every special occasion.  One warning that merited knocking a star off is that there are invariably four or five within the box that are hard and dry within.  That's not very nice when serving these to guests and there is no way to tell just by looking at it.<br /><br />Also, my last batch had one whole flavor (the chocolate-robed with green diagonal stripes) where every one of them was dry.  It only happened once and my family loves these too much to knock it down another star for that.

review/summary: Good Taste and Texture if you handle the gas
review/text: As other reviews have commented, this is great alternative in terms of taste and texture to sugared licorice candy.  However, eating more than a small quantity will cause lower tract distress from mild gas to mover severe symptoms.  So, if your system doesn't react badly, this is a good choice for the licorice lover.  My rating of 4 out of 5 stars is based on these effects.

And they have the right sort of hard gummy texture that I associate with licorice. I've been dieting lately, and one or two or these definitely satisfies the sweets craving. You can eat 7 pieces and and only ingest 5 calories.<br /><br />I also keep them in the car when I'm on a long drive. Delicious and guiltfree.

review/summary: Nice licorice taste, but beware of it containing Acesulfame K and "Artificial Sweetenet"
review/text: I love the black licorice flavor and am thankful for a sugar free option (there are so few and no candies I've found that contain what I consider to be the only safe sugar-free option, stevia); but I wish all websites would list all ingredients so you know before purchase in case you're sensitive or wish to avoid a substance.  This does contain Acesulfame Potassium (K), which I would rather it didn't since it stimulates insulin secretion in a dose dependent fashion thereby possibly aggravating reactive hypoglycemia ("low blood sugar attacks"), which I experience at times.  Because of this I only consume at most 1 pastille every other day, partly to prevent developing a sensitivity to anything in it.  It also lists "Artificial Sweetenet", which I would like to know what that is. Would I have purchased this/purchase again with full disclosure"? - I'm not sure at this point.

review/summary: Used to be perfect, now just good
review/text: I used to love these, with my only complaint being that they were a tad on the dry side. Unfortunately, they changed the recipe last year and now they are just a little better than other cereal bars. The main changes in the ingredients list seem to be that they changed the proportions and no longer include sesame seeds. The changes seem minor, but the taste is noticably worse (I wouldn't have bothered checking the ingredients if I hadn't notice the different taste). Oh, the calorie count also went up from 110 to 130.
