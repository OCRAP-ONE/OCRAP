review/summary: really quite nice, if a tad too much added sugar
review/text: howdy y'all,<br /><br />as others have pointed out, they added sugar to this. it makes it rather more sweet than i was expecting. dates are sweet on their own, so added sugar is ... rather startling.<br /><br />other than that, these chopped dates are quite nice. too sweet for snacking, but pretty good when added to cold or hot cereal. since that's what i buy them for, i can live with the extra sugar.<br /><br />rated a THREE since there is no significant plus or minus to this product. the added sugar comes perilously close to a minus one, tho.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee

review/summary: Very authentic and spicy, tastes great with some basmati rice, great for beef too.
review/text: This is the authentic product, I can vouch for it since I am from India. The ITC Hotel chefs who created this recipe are very well regarded in India. Its just the right mix for a spicy lamb curry, all you need to do is mix it with water and add the lamb and then let it simmer on your stove for 30-45 minutes to bring out the aromas and flavors. Really convenient and time saving.<br /><br />The lamb curry paste is spicier than a butter chicken curry mix. The chicken curry usually has a more creamy consistency and is sweeter due to higher content of tomatoes. The lamb curry has a base of garlic, ginger, black pepper, onions, tomatoes and other highly aromatic Indian spices (bayleaf, cinnamon, star anise, cardamom, cloves, black cardamom, shah jeera, corriander seeds, red chilli powder etc.).<br /><br />I usually make my own curry as I prefer fresh ingredients but this mix is wonderful, it has just the right blend of spices that go into lamb curry. The secret to Indian food is to lower the flame once a curry boils and then simmer it for quite some time. This step is not a must if you're in a tearing hurry but it unlocks the real flavors.<br /><br />Once done this curry keeps very well in the refrigerator. In fact, as with all spicy curries, it even tastes better the next day. I use two packets at a time to make an entree for 6 people.<br /><br />Variations:<br />I sometimes add some 1X1.5 inch cubes of diced potatoes along with the lamb to absorb the spiciness which makes it into a "Lamb Vindaloo". Or you can use beef instead of lamb, it will taste great with any red meat that absorbs the spice.<br /><br />If you're a vegetarian, you can use this curry with potatoes and green peas since the curry paste does not contain any meat in it. Just remember to add peas towards the end of the simmering process or they will get bleached out and you'll get a fantastic dish.<br /><br />Pairing:<br />Pair this lamb curry with some aromatic basmati rice, cooked till all grains are done but still separate, and a bowl of plain yogurt (with a little sugar if you like) to counter the spiciness. Or you can also buy frozen Indian nan/roti from the local Indian grocery store, toast it in the oven and enjoy. Yummy!

review/summary: Wow!  This stuff is GOOD!
review/text: I usually make my own curries from scratch, but sometimes I'm in a hurry and prefer not to spend the time required.  At that point, I'd head to one of the several good Indian restaurants to satisfy my curry cravings.<br /><br />I read the reviews here, and decided to give the Kitchens of India Curry Paste for Lamb a try.  All I can say is WOW!  This stuff really IS good.  At just over $2.00 per package, it's a great deal, too.  Each package makes 2-3 servings -- very reasonable indeed.<br /><br />I used lamb shoulder, cut into bite-sized pieces, and browned it a bit (the instructions don't tell you to do that, but I like the flavor), then added the paste and 2 cups of water.  Bring it to a boil, and let it simmer for 45 minutes or so.  I paired it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XIZMQ">Saffron Yellow Rice</a>, and it was very tasty.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying more of this.  I also purchased the Kitchens of India Butter Chicken mix at the same time, and can't wait to try it!

review/summary: Great, easy way to have Indian food
review/text: I really like the flavor of this curry. It has a lot of salt, but you really aren't supposed to eat the whole curry mix all at once. There's easily enough for 4-5 portions. I like using beef (top sirloin) instead of lamb, and I imagine any red meat would work. As far as the spiciness goes, it's not nearly as hot as some of the reviewers have noted. I can imagine if you tried drinking it with a spoon you might find it hot, but for me it was pretty mild. Maybe if you find normal Tobasco sauce spicy you might think this is hot.

I live in NYC and am a huge authentic curry fiend, been all over testing all the local places, as well as some not-so-local places (been to india, loved it)...this curry rivals or exceeds the quality of the food you'll find in a restaurant.<br /><br />Making this is the easiest thing in the world: cut up meat, empty packet and water into pot, cook for a few hours, enjoy.<br /><br />This should be made with regular lamb shoulder or even blade chop meat, cooked for 2 hours or more, with less water than recommended, and then a little bit of light coconut milk added at the end to thicken up the curry.  A little rice or naan and you're all set.

review/text: Being busy with work forced me to eat out almost everyday which resulted in me consuming unhealthy predictable food..  So, I wanted something that could be made very fast and yet tasting "non ready made".. Well I found the answer and that's the Kitchens of Indian pastes. I was first introduced to this by my friend, who cooked up a tasty Lamb meal, I could have sworn that he bought it from a nearby Indian restaurant. But to my surprise , he made it and I knew if he could create such a tasty dish, then I can also do it.. He gave a box of lamb curry paste and I just followed the simple instructions and the end result was a very tasty Lamb Curry.. I was so impressed with this product, that I decided to buy their variety pack from amazon so that I could sample their other curry pastes.. I hope they will be tasty like the lamb curry paste!!

review/text: Maybe it's just me but I didnt care for this lamb curry. I have had butter curry chicken and briyani and they are all good. This tastes kind of weird to me and I am a lamb person. if anyone could share an alternative recipe, I would greatly appreciate it<br /><br />Update: I just tried this again with additional ingredients and this time it tasted much better. I used some Italian herb and Kosher Salt to marinate the lamb for a night. And then added some onion to the pot and let it cook for an hour. It tasted awesome. FYI I also used imported lamb (from New Zealand) this time. Not sure if that played a part in the difference in taste.<br /><br />Would appreciate it if anyone can share his/her recipe

review/text: I like to order goat curry with Naan when I go to Indian restaurant.  Bought one and tried it at home.  It is at lease as good as those you find at Indian restaurant if not better.  Just wait for the promotion period and buy more.<br /><br />One suggestion, curry with goat is better than curry with lamb.  That is my preference.<br /><br />One receipt I made myself.  After cooking goat/lamb as instructed by the package, find a small pumpkin.  Cut the top to open it and empty the inside.  Then put the cooked goat/lamb curry inside.  Put the top part you cut back to cover it.  Steam it altogether.

review/summary: The best for and Indian Influenced Stew
review/text: I:<br />- am no expert in authentic Indian Cuisine<br />- love curries and make up my own both from scratch, and using the mixes of various brands from the store.<br />- have tried most of the Kitchen's of India Curry pastes....up to this point my favorite has been butter chicken...MMMMM.<br /><br />BUT, the lamb is now my favorite if I want to make an EASY curry stew.  You add the most water (2 cups), and simmer it the longest (they say 45-55 minutes to tenderize the lamb).  I find it is perfect for adding traditional stew vegitables (and either lamb or beef) for a tremendous stew.  The result is not the thick sauce of the other KOI curries....but delicious none the less.  A great alternative to the butter chicken curry.

review/summary: Not my favorite, but an OK substitute
review/text: I can tell from the reviews I've read that my opinion will differ from most.  My disappointment with this curry paste is that I found it considerably milder than what has become my standard <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SBB8M4">Patak's Vindaloo Curry Paste, Hot, 10-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 6)</a> which I would absolutely subscribe to if Amazon would ship it here.  Unfortunately for me, they will not :(  So given the general tenor of the reviews and opinion of obviously informed people, I ordered this.<br />Patak's is sold at one health food store on this island (Ohau) and the price has quadrupled in the past 3 years, so I came to Amazon hoping I could get it here.  I can not, but likely you can (they ship to the 48 contiguous states but not Hawaii or Alaska).<br />I found this to be a passable substitute, but prefer Patak's enough that I am willing to pay twice as much if need be.  I will note that this recommendation would only apply to those who like hot curry.  If you thought this was hot, stay away from patak's ;)<br />My work around is to spice this up with patak's pickles <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JSQDVS">Pataks Mixed Pickle 10oz</a> (which I am positively addicted to).<br />I would recommend this for those who do not like hot curry, or who, like myself, are out of range of Amazon's shipping for Patak's.  If they start shipping that to Hawaii, I will switch over without a second thought.  I have it on subsciption now for when I am too tired to make paste, and am out of my preferred.  With only one small store carrying it here, that sometimes happens, so I am glad I can get this to have something on hand for those times.<br />I'll note one other advantage; likely the one which allows amazon to ship here; is that Kitchens of India pastes are packed in foil pouches, so they take up less room in your cabinets.  The premeasured amount is both a positive and a negative.  like with anything else packed in singled-serve it costs a bit more than a jar (for example).  It also does not allow you to easily adjust for your own taste preferences.  I suspect that I'd like it better if I doubled the recommended amount, but that's all I can do; 1 or 2, or... I can not put in a 2 tablespoons vs .5 for example.  For me, this is a serious draw back.<br />In brief, it is a convenient product, makes a nice dinner very quickly, but i find it on the weak side and would switch brands of curry paste if I could get the other here.

review/summary: Warm winter meal; a delicious change from soups and stews
review/text: We came across the Kitchens of Indian curry paste during an Amazon grocery sale. We picked up a pack of six boxes for only $7! Even at its regular price, this is a good value for dinner. We've added the product to our Amazon Subscribe & Save program deliveries.<br /><br />The aroma of onions, garlic and Indian spices filled our kitchen. The paste is spicy but mild enough that we didn't hesitate to share it with our young children. The curry dinners, which we serve with a side of steamed rice and some mild lime pickle, have been a tasty addition to our winter menu of soups and stews.<br /><br />In addition to lamb, we've paired the curry paste with pork chops, cutting half the meat into small bites and leaving the rest on the bone - all of it slowly cooking in a saucepot.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend using beef or chicken with this curry paste. (The company has a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V17MLS">Butter Chicken Curry paste</a> we look forward to trying soon.) Although, tofu would work nicely if you want to skip the meat.

Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.<br /><br />BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LABELING INFO THAT IS PROBABLY EASIER TO READ -- remember, all the nutrients are naturally occurring - nothing is added!<br /><br />Supplement Facts<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 heaping tablespoonful (16 g)<br /><br />Servings per container: 31<br /><br />Amount Per Serving % Daily Value<br /><br />Calories 35<br /><br />Protein 8 g 16%<br /><br />Thiamin 1.4 mg 93%<br /><br />Riboflavin 0.7 mg 41%<br /><br />Niacin 5.3 mg 27%<br /><br />Vitamin B6 0.6 mg 30%<br /><br />Folic Acid 240 mcg 60%<br /><br />Vitamin B12 2 mcg 33%<br /><br />Biotin 16 mcg 5%<br /><br />Pantothenic Acid 0.4 mg 4%<br /><br />Calcium 59 mg 6%<br /><br />Iron 1.5 mg 8%<br /><br />Phosphorus 234 mg 23%<br /><br />Magnesium 33 mg 8%<br /><br />Zinc 1.2 mg 8%<br /><br />Copper 0.5 mg 25%<br /><br />Manganese 0.13 mg 7%<br /><br />Chromium 60 mcg 50%<br /><br />Sodium 60 mg 3%<br /><br />Potassium 222 mg 6%<br /><br />Alanine 592 mg *<br /><br />Arginine 464 mg *<br /><br />Aspartic Acid 800 mg *<br /><br />Glutamic Acid 1120 mg *<br /><br />Glycine 400 mg *<br /><br />Histidine 208 mg *<br /><br />Isoleucine2,3 400 mg *<br /><br />Cystine 112 mg *<br /><br />Leucine2,3 624 mg *<br /><br />Lysine' 592 mg *<br /><br />Methionine' 144 mg *<br /><br />Phenylalanine' 368 mg *<br /><br />Proline 400 mg *<br /><br />Threonine' 400 mg *<br /><br />Serine 448 mg *<br /><br />Tryptophan1,2 96 mg *<br /><br />Tyrosine 304 mg *<br /><br />Valine2,3 480 mg *<br /><br />'The L-Tryptophan in the product is naturally present in the protein.

review/summary: B Vitamin Bonanza
review/text: I first encountered brewers yeast when pregnant.  It kept coming up again and again as the perfect food based nutritional additive.  Since it is food based and not a suppliment, it is easily absorbed.  However, it is known for its unpleasent taste.  A serving is two heaping tablespoons, and at first I could not find something to mix it in that I liked well enough, so I gave up on it temporarily.  It kept coming up in my researches for a healthy pregnancy, and so returned to it and it has remained part of my daily routine.  The mix I found I like quite well is the two heaping tablespoons mixed into about 5oz of Pom pomagranite juice.  This mixture is actually quite pleasent.<br /><br />I have tried a few different brands, and I am fond of Twinlab for the more palitable taste and the balance of the B vitamins.  The "subscribe and save" deal on Amazon puts it at a very good price.

review/summary: The Cats Like It
review/text: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPUPSS">Brewer's Yeast</a> is for my cats. Every day I sprinkle a little onto their food. They like the taste of the yeast and regard it as a special treat. The yeast provides them with extra B vitamins.<br /><br />One of the vitamins in the yeast is vitamin B1, thiamine. Many people believe that thiamine repels fleas. This has not been proved. However, since the cats like the yeast, they get in on their food. One 18 ounce bottle seems to last forever. Also, they do not have fleas.

review/text: I ordered this as what is said to be a more bio-available source of chromium and B12, as well as essential amino acids, vitamins, minerals and trace elements, vs most of the peddled chromium supplements. I haven't tried sprinkling it directly on food but I have enjoyed adding it to my shakes and the flavors it imparts. A blender helps when adding to liquids as it seems to mix about as well as powdered cocoa.

review/text: I was looking for a brewers yeast that I could add to my protein drink so as to be able to get the amazing health benefits of brewers yeast also.  This yeast, while I am sure is quite healthy and a huge health benefit, tastes horrible.<br /><br />The taste so changes the taste of the protein drink, that I found that I actually skipped drinking my protein drink rather than have to endure the taste of it with this brewers yeast.<br /><br />Epic Fail.

review/summary: Good taste, bad solubility
review/text: I started taking brewers yeast because the large amount of chromium in it is supposed to be very good for your skin, especially if it's acne prone. I've been taking it since the end of January and my skin still breaks out a little bit, but I stopped taking it for a couple of days and my face broke out a lot so I suppose that it is having some sort of an effect. An online review I read said that most people's skin cleared after eight months in an study, so I am staying positive.<br /><br />I started out by taking Swansons' Brewer's Yeast Powder, and mixed it in smoothies and grapefruit juice. I tried mixing it in orange juice, which was pretty bad, and even just having it with water, which was horrible and made me gag. Because I wasn't crazy about the taste, I read some reviews and decided to try this product next. The taste is much better, it is much less noticeable, especially if I add a little bit of peanut butter or grapefruit juice to the smoothies. The taste is also not at all noticeable in warmed apple juice. I don't have the courage to try it in plain water, though.<br /><br />What I dislike about this product is that it does not dissolve well. I cannot stir it in any cold liquid without getting clumps (hopeless when stirred with a spoon or knife, somewhat works when stirred with a fork but little clumps remain), I can barely dissolve all of it in warmed liquids, and if I put it first in my blender when I make the smoothies, a lot of it remains at the bottom. In that respect, I liked Swansons' Brewer's Yeast better. This one is a little bit high maintenance because if I want to just have it in grapefruit juice, I have to put it in the blender first and when I make smoothies, I have to make sure that it's one of the last things to go in. I would, however, buy this product again if I can't find a brewers yeast that has the taste of this product with a better solubility.

review/text: this stuff is ok.  I was hoping it was the flakes but it's a very fine powder, like a flour consistency.  Which makes it kinda turn pasty when sprinkled on veggies or sprinkled on popcorn.  The taste isn't bad, not really great either, but not bad.  I think the yeast flakes would be better, more texture.  But since it only comes in the 3 bottle package, I have 3 bottles to get through now before I can buy the flakes!  If you're not sure you'll like it, try to find it in a single bottle first.

review/summary: Not too sweet, nice balance of chocolate
review/text: McVitie's chocolate digestive biscuits have been popular dunked in tea in the UK since 1925 but are somewhat hard to find in the U.S.  The taste of the cookie is quite similar to a graham cracker although the texture is more similar to shortbread.  The dark chocolate version is much better than the milk chocolate ones as the cookies themselves are not too sweet.<br /><br />These are not dainty cookies but everyone seems to like them, especially children.  Two cookies makes a nice treat with a glass of milk or a cup of tea, coffee, or chocolate.  If you enjoy graham crackers, shortbread, and chocolate, you should like these as well.<br /><br />My only complaint is with the packaging as they tend to stick together during the summer when the chocolate gets a bit gooey.  The "Grab & Go!" cans also have lids that don't fit very well at all.<br /><br />Ingredients:  wheat flour, dark chocolate flavored coating [sugar, chocolate, vegetable oil (contains one or more of the following:  shea, illipe, sal, palm, mango kernel, kokum), cocoa butter, butter oil, soy lecithin, polyglycerol polyricinoleate, natural flavor], palm oil, whole wheat flour, sugar, glucose syrup, leavening (sodium bicarbonate and ammonium bicarbonate), malic acid, tartaric acid, salt, calcium carbonate, reduced iron, nicotinamide, thiamine hydrochloride.<br /><br />Nutrition facts per cookie:<br />calories - 80<br />calories from fat - 35<br />total fat - 4 g<br />saturated fat - 2 g<br />cholesterol - 0 mg<br />sodium - 60 mg<br />total carbohydrate - 11 g<br />dietary fiber - less than 1 g<br />sugar - 5 g<br />protein - 1 g

review/summary: Gummies for adults with a sweet tooth
review/text: I discovered the Dare Real Fruit Gummies when I was in Vancouver, BC, visiting my daughter.  I really like gummies if they are soft and chewy, and that is what hooked me on these.  I have many food allergies, and these don't have a bunch of artificial ingredients that cause me problems, either.<br /><br />When I returned home to Kansas, I was unable to find them locally and began the search for a source.  I was surprised and pleased to discover them at Amazon at a lower price than I had been able to buy them in Canada (even in the discount stores).  Of course it requires buying in bulk, but they keep well, and if they are stored in air tight containers, there isn't any loss of quality over several months time.<br /><br />The gummies themselves are amazing.  They are very soft, and the flavors are all natural.  I especially like the Orchard Fruits and the Tropical Fruits selections because of their distinct flavors.  These aren't the typical gummy bears from discount stores.  The flavors are more for adults -- more subtle and complex; they are softer than other gummies, and they don't have an artificial after taste.  They don't have added sorbitol like many of the commercial gummies.  They aren't low calorie, at about 15 calorie a piece, they aren't food for dieters, but what candy is?<br /><br />The price seems steep, but the 12 bags are pretty large (several servings in each bag), and in Canada they are considerably more. I see them as a real value when purchased in quantity that allows for free shipping.

I bought some once while visiting and I have gone to the extreme of ordering an entire box of them from Canada when I had trouble getting them here. They used to be at "Brooks Drug", of course there is no more "Brooks Drugs".  All drug store have reduced to buying the cheapest terrible US made candy. Target used to carry them but discontinued them because they can't compete price wise with the very cheap disgusting alternatives. It would be great if the American consummer insisted on quality food products like the Canadian and European consummer. Anyways these are the best!!!!!!

I added the spice packet two times but I wasn't all that thrilled with bitting into bits and pieces of the various parts while I ate.  So the last time I made it I first started with the butter and added the spice packet (simmer according to instructions).  Next I added 1.5 cups of water then I let this simmer.<br /><br />Next I prepared the veggies.  The first time I didn't use the lemon curd as instructed.  The second time I did.  The third time I used plain yogurt (6oz per packet).  The lemon was my least favorite and the yogurt was my most favorite.<br /><br />After about 30 minutes of simmering the spice packet (when the veggie prep was done) I strained the water/spice mix into the veggies.  Then I followed the recipe to the end.

Keep aside for 20 mins. Heat 2 tbsp clarified butter (Ghee) or butter - with entire contents of spice pack (provided along with the paste pack) for 2 mins.  Add marinated vegetables & 1cup water.  Simmer for 30 mins once it starts boiling under closed lid.  Cook for 5 more mins on high flame.  Prepare boiled rice separately, using 1 1/2 cups basmati rice, 2 1/2 cups water & 1/2 tsp salt.  Cook till rice absorbs all water.  Cover and keep aside for 25 mins.  Mix cooked gravy with rice & simmer under closed lit for 3-5 mins.  Serve Hot."  There are also microwave directions, but I've only used the "pan recipe."  Instead of lemon curd, I've substituted plain vanilla yogurt or half-n-half.<br /><br />I've prepared this dish with and without meat, although the package states it's for vegetable biryani.  My favorite mix of ingredients to use are vegetables from my freezer including: cubed broccoli stalks, carrots, peas, cauliflower, broccoli florets, and one fresh cut potato.<br /><br />This is a very easy and delicious meal to prepare, the package states 4 servings.  There are easily four large servings, and the leftovers reheat well.

review/summary: Good paste.
review/text: I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I improvised.<br />A little bit of oil in the bottom of a pan with the spice packet, heat to infuse oil, then added 1lb frozen bag of cauliflower, 2-3 potatos cubed, and 1 package frozen sliced okra, one cup water, spice paste.  Cover and cook until veggies are thawed, and stir.  Cook until tender, stirring occassionally.  In about half an hour, a really good sauce/ curry with vegetables is ready.  Serve over rice with toasted flour tortillas, and it's a fairly quick, low prep meal with leftovers for lunch 2-3 days.  And costs half of what it'd cost eating out.

review/summary: Delicious - but spicy HOT
review/text: This smelled wonderful while cooking.  The flavors were great, but it was very spicy hot.  I usually order "medium" spicy in Indian restaurants.  This would fall on the very high end of that -- more like "hot" or "very hot".  My wife could not eat her portion at all because of the burn of the spices on her tongue.  If you like it hot, though, the flavors were great.<br /><br />Note:  The recipe on the box calls for 2 1/2 Tablespoons of lemon curd.  If you have trouble finding lemon curd you might try yogurt, instead. The small amount doesn't have a huge impact, and the yogurt might cool the spices a bit.

review/summary: Way Too Spicy!
review/text: I really wish that this was less spicy as it smelled lovely while it was cooking but the heat overpowered the flavor for me. I am truly disappointed because I  now have 5 packages left that I will not be able to eat. I have never eaten in the restaurant where it was this spicy and I really love Biryani. I tried to tone it down with yogurt and thought may be the rice would thin out the heat but it didn't. I wish this would have worked because it is a little more work than "ready-to-eat" meals and it ruined a perfectly good dinner for our family.<br /><br />If you can handle very spicy foods then you may love this as the flavor may not be overpowered for you, but if you like mild to medium then I would stay away from this.

review/summary: Delicious but quite spicy!
review/text: I was very excited to get this product, as I like a lot of other Kitchens of India products.  I must say that this is VERY spicy.  On a scale of 1 to 10 in spice I would give it a 7.  I really enjoy spicy food so I still ate it.  I followed the directions, using 2 cups of broccoli, cauliflower, and carrot mix with the paste.  Made the rice seperately.  Simmer the spice packet in butter before adding it to the marinated veggies and cooking it with a cup of vegetable broth.  The rice instructions called for 1.5 cups of dry rice being cooked up and then mixed with the gravy, I accidentally made 2.5 and the gravy produced still covered it quite well.  My boyfriend and I honestly felt the spice would've been too strong with less rice for it to cover.  Also instead of lemon curd I used plain yogurt, which other reviews also said worked quite well.  My boyfriend who is still working his way into enjoying spicy food ate it as well, but slowly due to the heat.  Overall, very happy with the purchase!

review/text: I simply cannot make realistic spicy Indian food.  I can come close on some things but it's been mostly OK with some failures. Each package has a paste you marinate the vegetables in and a seasoning packet used when you cook them.  The seasoning packet contains whole mustard seeds, cardamon, and bay leaves. It is spicy! Just the way I like it.<br /><br />My only gripe is pulling the whole bay leaves out of the food after it's finished.

review/summary: Great lunch or side dish!
review/text: BACKGROUND: Nope. I'm not Indian, never been to India either.  I'm 2nd Generation Italian-American.  I do cook many ethnic foods and Indian has been my favorite for years (don't tell either Grandma!).  Indian from scratch can be laborious and KOI sauces are a nice shortcut for a quick meal.  Of course, they aren't as good as toasting whole spices, peeling tomatoes, etc... but hey, dinner is on the table in less than an hour and usually tastes pretty darn good.  That said, I'm trying to review all the items I've tried.<br /><br />Kashmiri Veg Birhani - Not as good as fresh homemade (duh).  It is a bit oily - at least it is from butter and sunflower oil not palm or trans hydrogenated who-knows-what fats.  I added 1/2 cup of leftover rice and it was perfect.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE CILANTROPHOBIC (some people taste soap - it's a genetic thing, don't blame the food: google the NY Times, cilantro, and soap, they have a great article on the details) the cilantro/coriander in this seems to meld with the cloves and cinnamon and MIGHT really freak out your tastebuds.  If you don't like fresh salsa made with cilantro, you certainly won't like this.<br /><br />It needs more nuts- but for the price, (less than $2 a box on gold-box and subscription this time) I'm not too grumpy.<br /><br />My only complaint is that 24grams of fat (10 of it sat) for the whole box (two servings) is still way too much for rice and veggies.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Yup.  It is a huge money saver to work lunches.  Drop a couple in my desk drawer.

review/summary: Vegetarian, organic and all, really good, but - too spicy for Europeans
review/text: I have ordered this item in subscription last week, for the real good deal you'd get, but I fear I have to cancel that.<br /><br />I prepared it exactly according to the recipe on the package. I happened to still have a lemon curd in the pantry, so I could follow the recipe exactly. And I did everything exactly as suggested. It took about 2 hours all in all, with marinating and rice cooking and all. And it smelled really good. We love indian food, we often buy this brand (and other indian brands) brands from a store in our area. But just this item was never seen there, so I was trying something new.<br /><br />Now, was it my ignorance, or did I forget what "Biryani" means - I don't know, but somehow I did not remember any Biryani being so - uhm - spicy.<br /><br />We Germans call that taste "sharp", but in american english it is referred to as being "hot". I don't like "hot", since that means high temparature in my understanding.<br />So I am calling it spicy, but that term still is not fully covering it.<br />Many things can be spicy and not burn your mouth (not talking about hot temperature, again!!).<br /><br />But this spiciness was really too much for us.<br />I am German, my husband is American of slavic descent. We are used to spices like onions and garlic and such, but this spiciness was too much for us. I am sorry.<br /><br />This is probably a great food item for anyone who likes that kind of spiciness, and I am sure there is nothing wrong with it.<br />100% vegetarian, organic and all, really great, and such a good price! Only - we cannot handle that sharp taste.

review/text: I love noodles. I've probably tried every brand of instant noodles out there, and this is my absolute favorite for the balance in convenience, taste, fat/salt content, and work-friendliness. For the record, I think that Myojo chukuzanmai is better than this, but is a pain in the rear to prepare at work.<br /><br />The noodle cakes are dried, not fried, which gives them a pleasantly chewy texture when cooked. The broth is light and with a slight seafood/anchovy flavor, but not too strong smelling. At work, I just put the noodles in a bowl, add hot water, pop it in the microwave for 1.5 to 2 minutes, and it's fully cooked. Throw in the flavor packets and last night's leftovers for some protein and you're good to go.<br /><br />I am also absurdly happy that the noodle cakes are ROUND rather than a square. No more trying to squeeze the block into my round saucepan / bowl.<br /><br />And for those looking, the nutrition facts for 1 package of these are:<br />300 calories<br />Total fat 1g<br />Saturated far 0g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 1420mg<br />Total Carbohydrate 66g<br />Dietary fiber 2g<br />Sugars Less than 1g (for 1/2 pack)<br />Protein 8g

review/summary: Soothing Asian Flavors !!!
review/text: Our Asian-American family was introduced to Nong Shim through Amazon last year. Since then we have sampled a number of Nong Shim's soba (noodle) products. Every item so far as been really good and enjoyable. When Nong Shim says "spicy" they indeed mean spicy! We temper the hot flavors by adding a little less of the spice package (example: Kimchi Noodles), which probably is just they way Nong Shim intended.<br /><br />Now on to the Hoo Roo Rook noodles. A few days ago, we decided to sample Nong Shim's Hoo Roo Rook Family Pack. The Amazon package arrived a short while ago just before lunch. Excellent timing! The Hoo Roo Rook was easily prepared and served. The flavors were outstanding. Very soothing and full bodied with a mildly seafood flavor. Very low salt in contrast to most grocery store/discount store bought ramin. The noodles and broth could be served in high end Asian restaurants! There is none of that salty chemical taste that permeates the "3 for a Dollar" type of instant noodle cups. Oh, did I mention that they are delicious? This is surely an Asian comfort food!<br /><br />You won't be disappointed with Nong Shim's Hoo Roo Rook instant noodles if you even remotely enjoy Asian flavors. My family and I recommend them to you!

I make the sop  mix and poach an egg in it (YUM!), then add some tofu, and drop in some bok choy. Finally, neatly pile the noodles in a big bowl and pour the liquid over...top with an abundant pile of thin sliced green onion. Done! The whole operation takes about 10 minutes tops. If you skip all the add-ins, you are eating withing 3 minutes of thinking, "hmmmm, noodles!". No MSG, lo-salt, and the noodles are NOT fried.

review/summary: High Quality Packaged Noodle.
review/text: The first time I tried a package I found their anchovy base to be too fishy for my liking because i used the "for better noodles" version of the directions.<br /><br />The second time I used the standard directions of adding everything but the paste once the water is boiling. Then adding the delicious umami soup paste in the serving dish. You definitely don't want to waste any of this stuff, it's like liquid gold.  Prepared correctly, these noodles are hard to beat.<br /><br />The only heat comes from the tiny slices of pepper in the vegetable packet and do not translate into the broth. The broth has a light taste; not to say the broth is light on taste.  There is a large difference.  This broth doesn't have any MSG, and I was surprised to find that it shows in the taste.  Delicious but delicate.<br /><br />This is definitely a more traditional style noodle than other more popular mainstream american varieties, and almost seems to have a hand pulled noodle quality to it.

review/text: I just ordered my second case of this. These noodles are great. I absolutely love the flavor and I use both flavor packets ( I usually don't with other noodle brands). The veggie packet is quite good too. I love that these noodles are 150 calories. $1 per packet is pricey for me, however, the taste is worth it. I agree with the cooking instructions, but I cook them differently and have the same desired outcome. Because these noodles are much thinner that typical ramen, I cook them till almost aldente, and remove from heat. The water is so hot, and the noodles so thin that they finish cooking by the time it hits my plate. I drain almost all the water. The soup packet flavor is kinda weak for me, so the less water, the better. I really enjoy the soy type flavor packet as well. I hopes this helps.

review/summary: Healthier than ramen noodles and good for long term storage
review/text: We love Asian food so I was sure we'd love Nong Shim Hoo Roo Rook noodles - and we do!  They are simple rice noodles with separate packets of soup base powder, soup base paste and vegetable flakes, but unlike ramen noodles they are MSG free and not fried.  They cook in the microwave in a couple of minutes and are a great snack or small meal without any embellishment.  Cook them in a pot on the stove, add some meat and vegetables and they are a healthy, filling meal.  We love adding chopped bok choy or spinach, frozen shrimp or pre-cooked beef or chicken chunks, and some bean sprouts.  Add a squeeze of lime juice and some cilantro and you won't believe how delicious they are.  Because they are portioned into small packets you can decide how many to cook.  When you buy rice noodles at a grocery store or Asian store, they come in one big block that is often too much for one meal.<br /><br />They are quite a bit more expensive than ramen noodles, but it's not fair to compare the two when ramen noodles are about as cheap and unhealthy as you can go.  I'd rather pay more (these noodles are a dollar per pack) and have healthy, tasty food.<br /><br />What I like best about these noodle packs is that they don't go rancid on a pantry shelf.  Because the noodles aren't fried, they store well for several years. The individual packets are mylar (metallic plastic), which also protects the noodles from humidity. If you like keeping food stored for emergencies, these are wonderful.

review/summary: Tasty but expensive.  24 count package actually costs less.
review/text: This instant noodle soup is higher quality with larger portion size than the standard Ramen and has a small fraction of the fat.  Those are all pluses.  Not sure that it justifies being 5-6 times more expensive.  Bulk Ramen can be had for less than $.20 per package (vs. more than $1.00 for these).  I may try them again, just because overall its a tasty, low-fat meal, but would like to find a better option.  Also note that (as of this writing) the 24 ct. package costs less - so just get two of those rather than the 40 ct.

review/summary: Not much taste
review/text: Korean noodles are too hot or too bland. This one I've found too bland; it is definitely not Japanese product.<br />I can make it really good by adding extra ingredients but it's killing a purpose of buying instant noodles.<br />I lived in Japan quite a bit so my opinion is maybe against the grain but it's me and my taste.

review/summary: A real meal
review/text: I wasn't sure that I'd pay one buck for a small package of instant noodle, until I turned it into a real meal in 3 minutes! Just crack an egg after the water starts boiling, and add anything you might feel like, sometimes I throw in a few meatballs as well, veggie too. It tastes nothing like the 20 cents ramen noodle kind find in grocery stores. On a busy day, it is a quick and real meal. I'll make sure that I always have some in my pantry from now on.

review/summary: Not too bad, but there are drawbacks
review/text: This produce tastes quite nice, but the packages don't make very much food-- definitely less than a normal noodle package by Nong Shim. In addition, although I really liked my first portion, I started to get tired of the flavor more quickly than usual. The flavor profile is just sort of ... flat. It also doesn't go too well with eggs, which is how I usually prepare noodles... and because it's a little bit bland to begin with, it doesn't add much to rice, either.<br /><br />I think I'll stick with flavors like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQJT5K">Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Ramyun, 4.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 20)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQORDE">Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun, Gourmet Spicy Picante, 4.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 20)</a> in the future.

review/summary: not nearly as good as cheaper frozen noodles
review/text: These taste OK, certainly much better than the 10 cent instant ramen noodles. However, Asian grocery markets (in many USA cities) sell frozen noodle soup kits for less than $1 each and those taste much better than these expensive instant noodles. Cooking directions for frozen noodles are the same as for these instant noodles (boil for 3 minutes). Try the frozen noodles and you'll never go back to instant.

review/summary: Simple broth with a tad of chili to heat up your taste buds
review/text: The noodles are more akin to rice noodles: very quick to cook and hence 2 minutes is a tad long.  The pack also recommends you cook the soup base separately: I cooked the two dry ingredients packs for about one minute in boiling water then added the noodles (remove from heat just as the noodles are about to look transparent -- will continue to cook in the heat) and then add the wet sauce packet just before serving.<br /><br />The broth is simple and does not soak into the noodles much: so to get the flavor, have a spoon ready to mix the broth with the noodles.

review/text: This is the BEST packaged noodle I've ever had. It's light and brothy instead of oily or greasy. There's a slightly spicy aftertaste from the tiny rings of red peppers in the soup.<br /><br />It is on the expensive side but I'd rather pay more for something way better.<br /><br />Excited to see it on Amazon! :)

Three different packets inside allowing you to choose how you want to adjust your flavor so do not worry about it being too spicy.  Excellent thing to have around the home when you do not have anything else to eat or too lazy to cook something too extensive!

review/summary: A Play on  Words...
review/text: Right up front...I have never tasted these, but noticed an inconsistency in advertising as I was reading about this product.  I found it interesting that the description said..."No added MSG"  This product has MSG - they might not 'add' additional, but be warned, it has MSG.  If you look at the ingredients, the product contains Hydrolyzed Soy Protein.  Anything 'hydrolyzed' or 'autolyzed' creates the harmful portion of MSG--glutamates.<br /><br />For those of us that have to watch our MSG - we have to always be on the lookout for the hidden MSG.

review/summary: Deceiving, a pity, really...
review/text: Well, back to Mama noodles we go...<br /><br />I had high hopes when my friend I was visiting in Portland was using these for a quick long-day-at-work meal-between-meals. THEN I read the label.<br /><br />Hydrolyzed soy protein.<br /><br />Not only is soy already bad for your health beyond a quick-reached 10g a day "healthy moderation" level, but hydrolyzed soy (hydrolyzed "vegetable protein" almost always being soy, too) is full of MSG. It's not alone-- autolyzed yeast, corn-sourced maltodextrin (which is nearly all maltodextrin anymore), the list goes on, but in short they are all MSG... only unlike Europe, America does not require that special "enhancer" code for various food additives and we as a result have to constantly be stealthy (thanks, Monsanto).<br /><br />So that said, I did taste a bit of it, trusting his comment of no MSG (it makes my head and stomach both feel like a vice grip is being tightened on them)... and as I am sensitized to the weird not-salt flavor of it, I stopped and asked politely to see the package. Sure enough, glaring at me is MSG... For taste, I'd give it 3 stars overall--the MSG taste isn't super-strong, but it is apparent enough to set off all my alarms nonetheless, so I couldn't enjoy it.<br /><br />For ethics, it's a miserly negative 10 stars...

For whatever reason my stomach acts up every once in a while. Gastro Ease always fixes it for me (and does so faster and better than Tums).

It's always worked for me!<br /><br />I have not tried any of Health King's other teas.

review/summary: Very useful but needs directions...
review/text: I am an avid home cook and purchased this product as a thickener where the addition of heat is not desired. Example: I make my own mustard, and after accidentally over-diluting it with wine, I used the product to get back the thickness I wanted. I have also used it to thicken a thin barbecue sauce recipe I make, to help the sauce cling better when grilling, and it worked very well also. It does not seem to change the taste, but the texture does change somewhat, and is agreeable or not, depending on the desired viscosity of the product you are trying to create. My mustard was less creamy than I would like, but still very satisfactory, especially when I used the mustard in a sauce, where it added additional body to the final result. I have not attempted to create sheets or dehydrate films, but am certain that my uses for it will continue to expand.<br /><br />The downside and reason for the 4 stars: there are no directions, recommendations, or suggestions with the product at the time of my purchase. Even the WillPowder website gives only scant information, but that could change in the future. Perhaps there is an assumption that only professional cooks will be using the product and no guidance is needed? As a result of the lack of directions, on my first use, I started with a scant 1/4 teaspoon, and then rushed to add more when it didn't thicken immediately, just to discover that it takes a minute or so for the product to take full effect resulting in an over-thickened product. Because it is so easy to over-thicken, my suggestion is to add very little at first, slowly, then wait several minutes to see the results before adding more, until you get familiar with the product characteristics.<br /><br />I plan to keep Ultratex 3 in my kitchen at all times as a very useful product and staple. One jar should last a long time for the home cook with moderate use, since scant quantities are required.
