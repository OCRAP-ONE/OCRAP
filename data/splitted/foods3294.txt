review/summary: Really don't get the rave reviews. Tastes like stale butterscotches.
review/text: I made the mistake of buying a 50 pack of these k cups when they were on sale. The first few were decent, but the more I drank them, the more I started to dislike the flavor. At this point, I'm pretty much forcing myself to get through them since I don't want to waste them. The best way I can describe the flavor is a mixture of watered down coffee and old, stale butterscotch candy. Ugh.

review/text: I got hooked on Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee when we purchased a variety pack and this flavor was included.  It is such a rich, creamy, medium roast coffee.  I enjoy it in the morning, but love a cup in the evening as I settle in for the night.  I have just placed a reorder for  more.  If you enjoy flavored coffees, you must try this flavor.

review/text: We really enjoyed this coffee. Love buying in the bulk package. cut the top off the box and stow it away. Reach in and get a handful to put in our rack on the cabinet. The Butter Toffee flavor is so smooth. We have always enjoyed hazelnut but this is a step up in flavor. Just find a quiet corner and enjoy a cup to relax.

review/text: I like the 50-cup packs of coffee and I ordered Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee coffee because my first coffee choice could not ship for 2-4 weeks.  I was a bit worried because the GJ Mudslide was a slight disappointment.<br /><br />Butter Toffee is smooth with just the right amount of sweetness  The butter toffee flavor was distinct and at the perfect depth of flavor.<br /><br />This might be my new first choice in coffee!  I would recommend this to others.

review/text: This butter toffee has become my favorite k-cup flavor. Though I usually prefer unflavored coffee in the morning, this is an exception. It has just a hint of flavor and makes getting up a bit more tolerable. My daughter-in-law introduced me to it and, when my gift box was gone, i was glad to be able to replace it at a reasonable price at Amazon.

review/summary: Great Aroma but flavor Just Okay
review/text: I tried this based on the great customer reviews.  I use the Keurig at work (we have one that everyone shares - you just need to bring in your own K-Cups).  The aroma is fantastic, but the actual flavor is just okay. We typically run it through twice using the small cup setting, so it gives us a full large cup.  Maybe this is better if you just run it through one time and make a short cup.  I thought maybe it was just me, so I gave it to a friend who also loves flavored coffee.  He tried it and was not very excited either.  It is certainly a personal preference with regard to flavor.

We've tried other flavors from Gloria Jean's Coffees, and we have been satisfied with all of them so far.  We keep our K-Cups on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E">Keurig 5060 K-Cup Carousel, Chrome</a> so we're okay that the K-Cups ship in this box.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Try it with Caramel Macchiato cream!
review/text: To ensure that I don't waste your time, I want to begin this review by letting you know just what kind of coffee drinker I am. I drink coffee every day, sometimes up to 4 cups a day, depending on my mood. When I have coffee I use just a little sugar but a good bit of cream, usually flavored. International Delight French Vanilla has always been my old faithful, go-to creamer.<br /><br />I recently received a Keurig Cup Coffee Brewer and drank the Dark Magic K-Cups that were gifted with it. I found the Dark Magic to be very rich, a little over-roasted, but very drinkable. After running through the 24 pack I was looking for something different.<br /><br />I decided on the Butter Toffee K-Cup by Gloria Jean and was pleasantly surprised by the full, rich flavor delivered without any bitter aftertaste. The Butter Toffee is a medium roast blend with a very nice toffee flavor.<br /><br />Now on to my little recommendation. I was in Wally World the other day and was going to pick up some more French Vanilla cream when something different caught my eye. Coffeehouse Inspirations - Caramel Macchiato by International Delight. (Just so you know, this was the dairy based version, not the non-dairy shelf-stable individual portions.) I was rather impatient during the drive home to say the least. Let me describe the experience with a formula.<br /><br />Butter Toffee K-Cup + International Delight Caramel Macchiato = An amazing cup of coffee.<br /><br />While I'm not going to say that I've never had a cup of coffee this good, I cannot recall one off the top of my head. Try it!

It has nice big flakes of fish in the can and you can make it taste OH SO GOOD!<br /><br />But there is a but, and its a fairly big BUT.<br /><br />If only the soaring price increases on this product could be better contained AND if Amazon would kindly abide by the customer's delivery subscription date for  payment processing and product delivery -then- a subscription of this tuna would be a great pleasure.<br /><br />Frankly, if I begin a 30-day subscription (and billing) on the 5th of the month, I expect Amazon to bill me for further shipments on the 5th of the month, not days before the 5th nor on haphazard dates from month-to-month.<br /><br />Or lets say, I elect to receive subscription deliveries on the 12th of the month, I do not expect to receive those deliveries before the 12th of the month - PERIOD. Isn't the purpose of the subscription date setup provision to know what to adhere to meet the customer's satisfaction?<br /><br />Beyond these few quirks, I can commend the Amazon family for the great work that it does 24/7 ...... and yes, I absolutely love AMBROSIA TUNA!

It's like paying more than $2.00 per 6 ounce can. I don't know what the hell I was thinking, I FEEL RIPPED OFF. You do waaaay better catching tuna on sale at your local grocery store.

review/text: I agree the cardboard box isn't ready for gift giving.  However, the coffee selection is wonderful.  I'm learning which brands I prefer so I can narrow down future sample packs.  It's a great decaf introduction to the world of coffee for new Keurig owners.  If you're looking for presentation, buy a carousel and put the K-cups on display before wrapping, perhaps with some tape to hold them in while transporting.  The leftover K-cups that don't fit can then be transfered into any pretty box you desire.  The important thing is the coffee selection can't be beat, and the price is very reasonable.

Only to be superceded by the awe that I was stupid enough to buy this in the first place. I certainly will not be buying from Crazy Cups again.

There were 3 k-cups of most varieties, 4 k-cups of one variety, and 1 or 2 k-cups of a few varieties. The k-cups arrived in great condition loose in one cardboard box. This was my first k-cup purchase for my brand new Keurig.  I thought it would be nice to try a variety of coffees to see which I liked best, but I think I will continue to purchase this sampler because I liked them all!

It did provide me with a few decaf flavors that I like and can try to locate. I am happy to have more decaf available. The ones Ive tried are very tasty (Hazelnut and Fr Vanilla) so thats a plus. If you don't care about how it looks, and the number of flavored cups, buy it. It will give you an idea of the decafs out there...

review/text: If you're a k-cup coffee drinker, and you need a decaf every now and then, then:<br />a) you are locked into one variety and buy that in bulk, or<br />b) buy a couple different varieties in bulk and still don't get to try new blends very often<br /><br />Now, there's a third option.  This sampler pack, though being slightly more expensive on a unit cost basis (cost per k-cup), provides 2-5 k-cups of each variety of decaf there is.  We have ordered this twice, from the same seller, and each has come with a different mix, to our delight!<br /><br />If variety if the spice of life to you, and you are a decaf k-cup drinker ... you owe it to yourself to get this sampler.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Jon & Taylor

I'll still drink it, but I probably won't order the sampler package again.  Too bad =(

review/summary: "Brooklyn" brand?? in Amazon Keurig Sampler Pack
review/text: Since I read the reviews on the"Brooklyn" brand of K-cups for Keurig, and how they exploded in the machines of users, I was very skeptical to even try the four that I found included in my sampler pack. I just tossed them because having to clean my entire machine due to such mishap is certainly not worth it.  As such, I lost out on 4 of my coffees.  I am surprised that Amazon would still include them after such poor reviews.<br />I will certainly not order this item ever again, and maybe anyone else should think twice as well!! As for the rest they were fine but coffee is too expensive to be losing money on 4 cups I did not get to enjoy!

I think it's a little pricier than I'd like, (hence, the 4 stars) but it's a good way to narrow down the brands you like and eliminate those you don't.  Yes, mine came in a regular box, nothing special, but I don't care because I didn't purchase them as a gift.  But, it's a consideration if you are shipping them as a gift.

review/text: I recently purchased a keurig brewer and was looking to try some decaf choices. The brewer came with a sample starter pack but only had 2 decaf k-cups.  Amazon was the only place that I could find such a large sample pack of decaf. Overall I've only tried 3 of these kcups and they were all decent and about as good as decaf will get. Some reviews mentioned the box is unpleasant looking. Not in my case. The kcups came in a nicely printed sample pack that would be perfect to give to someone as a gift. Looks like they changed the packaging for the better.

review/text: Maybe I am just way too excited by coffee but I was so excited to get this in the mail today! Got a Mr. Coffee that uses the K-cups for Christmas and I ordered this right away. It's hard to find a good variety of decaf in the store. I am trying the Green Mountain hazelnut as I type this and I love it. I am excited to try the Tully's French Roast next. I agree with a former reviewer who said this was just a bunch of cups thrown in a box but I didn't mind much. It had a great variety in the box unlike the person who said they got mostly the same type. I will be buying this again when it runs out!

review/summary: Marvelous
review/text: I just purchased the single brew system by Cuisinart so I had never tasted the coffees before.  Being able to order a box of mixed brands and flavors enabled me to discover which one I liked best - which for me is the super bold.  All the brands were excellent - not a loser in the bunch.

review/summary: A CHANCE TO SAMPLE MANY FLAVORS
review/text: This was advertised as an assortment of various coffee flavors and brands.  I expected 30-35 DIFFERENT coffee flavors, but that didn't happen.  Instead, I received 10 of the same flavor, 6 identical flavors - twice - and the others had at least 3-4 K-cups.  However, I was in need of decaf coffee and I truly enjoyed sampling all the various products.  I found a new favorite by Gloria, and decided that Emeril's K-cups were too "dark roasted" for my taste.  This was an exciting experience in coffee tasting and I'm very happy with the assortment - just surprised that I had so many duplicates.  All-in-all, I would give this Decaf Sampler Pack a very favorable rating.

review/summary: So Much Variety!
review/text: I switched to decaf coffee a while back and was looking for a great sampler pack. This is it. I tried each one and found some favorites along the way. I truly enjoyed having the surprise of a different coffee each day. There were a couple that I did not like because they were too bold and I tend to like more medium type coffees. But other than that, I really enjoyed this sampler pack. Great value!

review/summary: reviews were right....
review/text: ok - it was ok the k-cups came in a plain white cardboard box, and it was ok the variety didn't include alot of flavored coffee, but.... the print they sent (not the one pictured!) was a crayon-like colored animal with coffee beans in his ears - crazy! It was embarrassing to watch my gift be opened! Oh well - live and learn. Still a good way to try out some different decaf k-cups.

review/text: This is a very good robust peach tea flavor, similar to what regular sugar Snapple tastes like right out of the bottle.  I generally don't like peach tea, so this was a surprising find.  I drink a Gallon of water with sugar free drink mix per day.  Crystal Light loses 1 star for using a cheap old sweetener, loses another star for being expensive, but gets a bonus star for being such an exceptional flavor.

review/summary: They Sell HORRID Coffee, Too!
review/text: R. Rothschilds markets a HORRID coffee through TJMaxx. It's undrinkable. Stale, smelly and without a "sell-by" date. It nearly made me sick. Apparently Rothschilds licenses their name to First Roasters in Longwood FL and doesn't care about how the product performs. At least, R. Rothschild didn't care when I called them about the problem today. I wouldn't trust any of Rothschilds products if they're so willing to lose their good name to a coffee marketing scheme.

However, she seems to have worked out some kind of system with the other cats in our neighborhood, because I have to keep shooing them out the back door in the morning.  They love this stuff and I think Princess holds the door open for them somehow.  If I can get a good webcam set up I'll catch her, eventually.  Meantime, I'm really glad I can get such a good price on this, and reliable delivery every month!

Mom is 70 yrs old, and has tasted many similar type chocolates, and said this was the best ever, by far.... No comparison.  She had one and took a lovely nap. :).<br />I will buy these again and again as a gift now, as all reviews from family members,(all food-snobs), were outstanding.... The chocolates are everything they claim to be IMO.<br />-Thank You!

Very hot hot hot.  It was unavailable for while there but it's back!...but a little more spendy now. the dropper idea is great from the other reviewer but it would probably put the price up past 20 bucks.  I mean what manufacturer makes tiny droppers for dispensing food integrated into a cap? Maybe like Viseen eye-dropers could get some business making bottles for MAD DOG'S REVENGE habanero extract hah!  By the way don't put it in your eye or you'll prolly be blind. Just saying cuz some peeps are dumb like that. Not me I just put it in my salsa and clean my colon couple times a month oyaaaa

review/summary: WOW!!
review/text: Mad Dog's Revenge was an awesome purchase!! I make a lot of hot things and just using habaneros it is hard to get the "heat" the same every time as the intensity of the peppers differ from one to the next, not so with Mad Dog's Revenge! A couple of drops from the eye dropper is the same every time, no guess work once I have a recipe down I can make the same again and again from "hot chocolates"* to "strabanerro jam"** the heat without any flavor change! great product!<br />*hot chocolates= 6 drips Mad Dog's Revenge/1 bag of Hershey's special dark chips<br />**strabanerro jam= 5 cups pur&eacute;ed strawberries, 6 drops Mad Dog's Revenge, 7 cups sugar 1 package pectin<br /> the only negative thing I can say about this product is that it doesn't come with an eyedropper so some product gets wasted every time. If an eyedropper were built into the lid it would be perfect!<br /><br />  Beaser Hendrix

review/summary: Great treats, but...
review/text: They are a bit too easy for my dog to get them off. The medium sized Premier Busy Buddy Bristle Bone Dog Toy with its rawhide treats had kept my 9 month old Pembroke Corgi occupied for a good while initially (more than 1 hour.) Later on she figured out that if she kept nibbling at just the treats, she'll get them off within 10 minutes. They are great treats, I just wish they make them a lot harder for my puppy to get it off. Perhaps make them out of a much tougher material?
