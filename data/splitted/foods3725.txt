review/summary: Awesome cup of coffee...
review/text: This is by far one of the better k-cup flavors.  Hazelnut has always been a favorite of mine and after purchasing the Keurig machine I was happy to learn I could get hazelnut.  It makes an awesome cup of coffee on the large mug setting; I love to have a cup when unwinding from a stressful day.

review/summary: Great coffee, cheap price
review/text: Investing in a 50 pack of coffee without trying it first was tough, but I'm glad I decided to buy this. The coffee is a good strong flavor with enough punch for the casual coffee drinker. I don't want my coffee to taste like unleaded and this fits the bill. The price is unmatched and the packaging is great since I'm not concerned with how it gets to me. I will note that the cups are loose packed and I've noticed 1 in the 10 or so cups I've brewed so far had grounds in the coffee. I'm using a B60 and this makes a good cup in all the different size settings. Amazon please continue to push this packaging/price point to other K-cup vendors. It really makes it an affordable luxury.

review/summary: Nice flavor and good packaging
review/text: I appreciate that Gloria Jeans is available in this "frustration free" packaging. At first I was surprised that the little K Cups were rolling around loosely in a big box, but then I realized that all that extra packaging to make them in boxes of 18 or 24 was unnecessary. How many people leave them in the box anyway? I always unload the cups in to my own storage boxes and coffee caddy.<br />The Hazelnut flavor is one of our favorites. It has a nice strong note even diluted with milk and sugar.<br />The price is always a good deal, especially with the free shipping. Always check Amazon for the best deal!

review/summary: Dave's Review of Gloria Jean's Hazelnut Coffee
review/text: I have been using this coffee since purchasing my Keurig B60 brewer. It is a great tasting flavored coffee which I start my day with. I drink anywhere from 2 to 5 cups a day depending on what I'm doing. I spend 6 to 10 hours a day on the internet marketing and the coffee helps me get through the day. I highly recommend this coffee for anyone who likes a great cup of delicious coffee.

review/summary: BUY IT NOW
review/text: It comes out to roughly $0.42/ cup.<br /><br />This is a much better deal than purchasing any other pack/size. It's the same Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cup as a regular retail pack, so there is no worries about it being anything else, lower quality or not so perfect k-cup designs. The only difference with this than any other pack/size is that you get 50 in this one cardboard box, so either place it in a k-cup holder rack, or leave it in the box.<br /><br />as for the product itself, its like a mild coffee. if you like your coffee LIGHT AND SWEET, once you add a bit much of cream/milk/hal&half...you taste it more than the coffee itself. The smell is great though when you make the cup...it fills the room with a rich hazelnut aroma.<br /><br />if you like BOLD BOLD BOLD BOLD, go with EXTRA BOLD coffee people k-cups.

review/summary: Heavy on the hazelnut, light on the coffee.
review/text: This has a good hazelnut flavor, but I could not really taste the coffee at all. The flavor is just a bit strong and the coffee is on the weak side. My 18 year old daughter who is just starting to drink coffee and was not allowed to have cafeinne at all growing up, loves it. She is at the Sure I like coffee if I can add half a cup of cream and 6 teaspoons of sugar stage of drinking coffee. She does not have to add nearly that aount to this coffee and she really likes it. She is in college and this coffee has become her study buddy. I would say it has a good flavor to it, but if you like a stronger coffee than this is not for you. If you like coffee as long as it does not taste like coffee, then I highly recommend this one. I do like it. It just does not have that coffee taste and does not really get me going. This is a super light blend in my opinion and I do not like super strong coffee. I am picky about flavored coffee and this one just does not taste like coffee to me.

The coffee itself is always delicious!  My shipments always arrive quickly and in good condition.  Being a single mom, a full time college student, and a full time Realtor, I don't have much time for anything else.  Brewing my coffee in 50 seconds has made my tight schedule much easier to juggle.  I highly recommend buying these K-Cups from Amazon!

Amazon has raised their pricing without informing of they're doing so and shipped the case without my approval at the newer higher pricing.  To me, this is bad business and taking advantage of the dedicated consumer.<br /><br />The coffee itself is more than wondeful.

review/text: I was happy to get my coffee. Me without coffee is like a baby without her sippy cup! I tore the box open and my heart sank. The individual K-Cups were just thrown around. The bottom of the box had a good amount of coffee grinds. I don't think the post office is responsible for the mishap because the box didn't appear damaged. The only logical explanation is the damage originated where the K-Cups were loaded into the box. Five out of the 50 K-Cups were unusable. If you don't think 10 percent is a big deal, then imagine going on a blind date and your blind date answers the door and you notice he/she is missing 10 percent of his/her teeth! See, 10 percent is a lot. Bottom line, I'm not ordering K-cups on-line anymore. I guess I'll just get of my butt and head down to the store. It will be worth the extra expense.<br /><br />Arthur M.

We've tried other flavors from Gloria Jean's Coffees, and we have been satisfied with all of them so far.  We keep our K-Cups on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E">Keurig 5060 K-Cup Carousel, Chrome</a> so we're okay that the K-Cups ship in this box.  Highly recommended!

But this is a far better idea- it's refreshing and tasty, keeps you alert, and doesn't have the jittery side-effects of caffeine or energy drinks. A healthy, yummy, unique option for focus and stamina!

He likes these because he can do it himself - he's very anti-other people feeding him at this point, so with these he gets to do it himself - they're fairly clean but every once in a while when he's in a particularly "playful" mood he realizes that he can squeeze it out and fingerpaint with them - still much cleaner and more efficient than trying to spoon feed him these days tho.<br /><br />I also use the subscribe function so these (along with two other varieties of these) get delivered every 3 weeks to my house - amazon gives a little bit off the cost as well and then i don't have to worry about it - its also MUCH cheaper buying in bulk this way via amazon as opposed to something like $1.50 each in the grocery stoe

My daughter gobbles these up. I just wish they sold a variety pack! I find myself filling with with individual ones of a different flavor here and there cause I can tell my daughter gets tired of it.<br /><br />Although, along with a previous review, I too, received the 3.5 ounce package rather than the size stated in the description. BUT, Amazon has amazing customer service and immediately fixed the problem. And that's the only reason I give it four stars (and the fact that I wish there was a variety).<br /><br />If you are thinking about buying these, totally worth it.

review/summary: Baby loved it, convenient pouch
review/text: Like others have said, the consistency of this stage 2 combo is very thin, but it could be thickened with oatmeal or cereal. My 7 mth old loved the flavor and impatiently waited for more, which she doesn't do with all baby foods. I like that it contains spinach for iron and fruit for antioxidants and to sweeten it a bit. I wouldn't use these everyday while I'm home because they are somewhat costly per pouch, but they are a terrific option for travel or when you need something easy on hand to feed baby. I tried squeezing the contents of the pouch into her mouth, which she didn't particularly like, but I think that's just because she's used to being fed with a spoon. An older baby could squeeze and eat this themselves and if you find yourself without a spoon, it's a great option.

review/text: I love the variety of flavors and fruit/veggie combinations HappyTot offers.  Being a foodie myself, I don't really expect my little one to want to eat the same flavors or items every day so knowing I can offer her a variety and great combos like the Banana, Mango and Peach pouch has been a great saving grace since she really likes to try different things almost weekly.  This flavor seems to be her favorite one though as she'll eat this one or ask me via 'sign' for this pouch more then the others.  With it being organic, all fruits and with great vitamins, I'm thrilled to have this readily available for her to enjoy.

review/text: These pouches are a godsend. I keep a stockpile in the pantry and in the car. Even on days when my two-year-old is feeling particularly picky, he will eat these up without blinking an eye. I love that they are made with organic ingredients with TWO green vegetables -- peas and green beans -- in one pouch, not to mention the pear for fruit. I also like that the salba is included in these pouches for the omega 3s and extra fiber. I had never heard of salba before, but it is a very nutritious grain that I'm glad to have in my son's diet. These pouches are dairy-free, nut-free and gluten-free too, so I never had to worry about them affecting my son's food sensitivities, although he has now outgrown most of them. All in all a great product and the flavor is a winner, even with my picky son!

Recently my son stopped taking food from a spoon, but he will let me squirt the pouches into his mouth.  I've also used the fruit blends in my older sons' smoothies.

review/summary: so easy- both baby & toddler LOVE it!
review/text: I needed an alternative to making my own baby food when I found these pouches at Target. It was SUPER easy to warm up the food just by putting the pouch in warm water, then serve to my baby. First I gave it to him using a spoon, but then he was reaching for the pouch so I just gave it to him! He absolutely loved it! I think the novelty of the pouch is so much fun for him. And I was happy that he was getting organic fruits and veggies for the day. Then my 3yo wanted to try it-also bc of the novelty- and she loved it too! I never thought she would eat "baby food" and spinach at that! But in the pouch, it's a great on the go snack or meal and it's healthy and we are all happy.

review/summary: Innovative, healthy and YUMMY!
review/text: We love these HappyTots! The flavors are wonderful and the added Salba grain is a great way to add nutrients. My son is in Kindergarten and he asks to take these to school for snack time. The pear added to this combo is especially nice since it adds sweetness not found in the veggies - a very nice balance of flavor. Also, the convenience of the pouch is so great, I keep some in my bag, in my car and at the grandparent's house so I know a healthy snack is always available. Highly recommend trying this product and flavor if you are looking to add tasty nutrition to your child's diet.

review/summary: The BEST
review/text: I have a four year old, three year old and 18 month old that love these. When I buy them, I have to get very creative with hiding them or they'll eat them all at once. I didn't know what they were and was very health concious with my slightly chubby and younger daughter. One day while on a walk, we saw these at Target so I bought them each one. Ever since we can't even drive past Target without being asked to stop and get them. We do a lot of traveling and I love these. My oldest is very picky, never ate baby food and was always a "junk foodie". This is the 1 healthy thing that goes down with out a fight. In fact she'll ask for more, then fight her little brother for whatever he still has left in the pouch. We do a lot of traveling and I always pack lots of these, quick, easy and healthy snack on hand.

review/summary: Dessert
review/text: My toddler loves this food so much that we have to keep it out of her sight to keep her from refusing whatever other food we're trying to feed her.  I can't for absolutely sure say it's this, but since these squeeze packs were introduced into her diet she will poop more than the usual...Just a friendly warning.<br /><br />These are amazingly handy to take with you when you go out since it gives them a dose of fruits and veggies all without needing a spoon.  My 1 year old has no problem holding the pack on her own and sucking the goo out of the pack.

review/summary: Good food, wrong product!!!
review/text: I ordered this for my 7 month old who LOVES this food. I ordered the 4.22 oz pack of 16, but received 3.5 oz pack of 14. I'm about to return it and ask for the correct product to be sent, but had I not looked closely, I would've just accepted this. Just be careful and make sure you're getting what you ordered. It says it comes from Amazon, but I'm wondering if there's a Happy Baby problem as well...the nutrition facts on the box don't match the nutrition facts on the pouch for the same 3.5oz serving. For example, the box says there's 100% daily value of Vitamin C while the pouch says 27%. I'm wondering if anyone else sees any discrepancies? I would think this would be illegal?

review/text: You can smell the spinach! It seems fresh and tastes wonderful. I fed it to my 2nd son when we were on the go during his babyfood stage and gave it to my preschooler as a snack. Now both often reach for these as a snack and I'm happy to offer them something other than cheerios or graham crackers when we're on the go.

review/text: It can be hard to get your infant/toddler to eat veggies.  My son likes this flavor of HappyBaby, and I'm happy because he's getting more exposure to veggie flavors that can be hard to get your kiddo to eat!  I'll definitely buy it again.

review/summary: Tastes great, so convenient
review/text: My 13 month old baby really likes this flavor pouch, in particular.  I have tasted all of the pouches myself and this flavor is one of my favorites, as well.  I never leave home without several pouches.  They have been super helpful when traveling and when out, in general.  My baby now sucks the food out, which makes it even more convenient than using a spoon.

review/text: My 17 month old boy loves these, I don't give him as much of these as I used to since he is now into table food more than purees, but I would mix half of this in his oatmeal in the morning or if we are out, I'll use these as a snack or dessert. They are a good handy pouch to throw in your diaper bag and can sit there for days, if not weeks! I love all the ingredients in this one, baby seems to enjoy it too!

review/summary: Great for Toddlers - this flavor is the most nutritious.
review/text: Our toddler loves this brand. We have tried the other brand of pouches, but she always goes back to these. The flavor and texture is the most favorable to her. We just recently subscribed to this item, because you could not beat the price. Target and our grocery stores have all increased their prices on this line, so they are no longer competitive with Amazon. There is also the bonus convenience factor since our stores were constantly running out of this brand.<br /><br />This flavor is the most nutritious. The pale green pouch comes second, but this combination really has by far the most nutrients than all the other flavors. Toddlers are of course picky and fickle, but our toddler very rarely turns down a "pouch" when all else fails.

review/summary: Multi-benefit pouc
review/text: I love these pouches!  From their ease of use for the baby (who just sucks it out of the pouch), to the easy-carry little-mess take-along value, to the interesting combinations of food.  The combos are perhaps odd, but good.  I love that some have the grains too, as that is what is needed to keep baby fuller longer.  I take at least one everywhere we go.  Needed one for the 6 yr old the other day who was hungry while we were out.  She loved it too.

review/text: My son loves it..so that counts for a lot, he has an easy time getting it out so thats a good thing too.  Be careful when giving it to your child, they may accidentally squeeze it out all over themselves.  Oddly, he really likes this flavor and not others....so its a repeat keeper for us.

review/text: My baby loves this combination. It is relatively high in iron becuase it has spinach and it contains omega 3 from chia seeds. This is the only way I can give my son a green leafy vegetable. It tastes really good. Most baby food that you taste is very bland, this one is really good.

review/text: I absoutly love these things!! And so does my 13 month old.. Perfect for when we are out and about and he gets hungry.. just pop the top open and my son will suck all the goodness out in a matter of minuites!! Then Put the cap back on and he will play with the pouch for quite a while, so dual purpose!<br />Also when he doesnt feel good (which has been qutie a bit because of teething) he will have one of these with no fuss.. So when he wont eat anything else I as least know he is gettin something good in his tummy when he has one of these.

When my daughter was younger we would mix these with cereal for breakfast. Now it is a great on-the-go snack and she eats directly from the pouch. (She is 16 months old).<br /><br />- My daughter loves it! She always asks for more.<br /><br />- With the subscribe-and-save pricing on Amazon, it's a good deal.
