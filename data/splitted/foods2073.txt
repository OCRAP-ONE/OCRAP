review/summary: Absolutely Perfect
review/text: This is the honey that should be the standard by which other honeys are measured.  It is absolutely delicious... it almost tastes like the yummiest caramel you've ever had!  You will find yourself licking the spoon each time you use it.<br />If you are unfamiliar with raw honey, you should be aware that this looks nothing like store-bought honey.  This is a solid form (almost like butter) & a rather milky-white color.  Don't worry... it blends well into smoothies, tea (or whatever) & even spreading it on warm toast is enough to soften it.  I often set the jar on a sunny windowsill to keep it soft.<br />I recommend this particular honey to everyone.  It is a bit pricey... but well worth it! :)

review/text: LOVE this honey and it's amazing with tea. I heard it loses it's benefits when heated but it's so damn good in tea I just can't help myself. Besides in tea it's a great tasting honey. Texture is firm and not runny like the processed ones in stores. Surprisingly it tastes way better than the runny crap in stores too!

review/summary: Good Honey For your Money
review/text: I'm deployed so i had to ordered and few 32oz to before i shipped out. I eat thi stuff daily and it tastes great. I thik that if you take this along with multi-vitamins and live a active lifestyle then this will be yield more benefits for you. I have started to ween myself off the workout stims and just take a tablespoon of this honey instead....It gives you a burst of energy for lifting weights and right before a run. The 32oz jar is pretty big for one person but if used daily it will last a long time. Remember that the other process honey has no benefit for you other than making your toast taste sweet. USDA Organic Honey is not processed which means that it has all of the pollen, vitamins and other stuff hence the dense apperance and yellowish coloring....I try my best to spread the word to my Army bros but it never seems to get thru...If the reviews in amazon don't convince you do some research !

review/text: I am not sure how the price per ounce calculation works but it seems to be incorrect (I am trying to find inexpensive honey). Currently it says .25 cents per oz. The product is 32 ounces. This should be an $8 product. Instead it is a $12+ product (not counting shipping). So that is closer to .38/ounce.

review/summary: Great for making desserts or eating with fruit
review/text: I just purchased my second jar of this organic raw honey.  I use it often as an ingredient to prepare desserts or fruit smoothies.  It's absolutely delicious!  The key to using this honey is to melt it properly before mixing in with the other ingredients.  I usually scoop out about a tablespoonful of this honey, place it in a small bowl, and microwave it for about 20-30 seconds.  Then the honey is ready to be used in my fruit smoothies (or plain greek yogurt).<br /><br />It's a great combination with sliced bananas or even drizzle a little over celery sticks.  A jar lasts about two months (I use it about 2-3 times a week).<br /><br />The packaging that the jar was wrapped in is also very good.

review/text: Ok, I purchased the Manuka Honey from Y.S Bee Farms, when the store was out of my regular brand, and halfway through the jar, I pulled out a looooong blonde hair on the spoon!! EWWW!! I was so skeeved, that I threw the rest of the jar out as it was contaminated as far as I was concerned.<br /><br />I emailed them, but not enough time has passed to get a response. I will post an update when I get one.<br /><br />But beware! If a hair got into the honey (we all have dark hair and no one has long hair in the house), you have to ask yourself how high their standards are when it comes to packaging and harvesting..Someone could get sick.<br /><br />Maybe that's why it's so inexpensive. You get what you pay for :(

If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of "softens" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!

I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.

review/summary: Bitter Grass Clippings
review/text: I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea "leaves" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a "premium" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.

The "Organic Premium" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better.

review/summary: Very Bergamot-y Tea!
review/text: ****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: "Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it."<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****

review/summary: This is not premium quality tea
review/text: I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.

review/text: I was looking forward to this product, as my wife and I both like Earl Grey tea, and decaf lets us drink it at night.  We drink a variety of tea, so we don't go through individual tea very quickly, so I was looking forward to the resealable packets.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea just doesn't taste good initially and has a particularly unpleasant aftertaste.  I definitely would not recommend buying this tea.

review/text: I have a wrapper from a single teabag of Nummi Tarry Lapsang Souchong, and the wrapper alone smells stronger after being opened for two months than a whole 3.5 oz bag of this smells fresh. This tea only has a light smoky scent and flavor, whereas the Nummi tea had a strong pine smoke scent and taste. I know that tarry lapsang souchong should be stronger, but I'm still a little disappointed at how weak this one is. Maybe I'll just use more tea for stronger batches.

review/text: Stash's gunpowder green has been a staple tea in our house for almost a year now. We prefer it iced, but it is decent hot. It is much more affordable than most other green teas and the quality is right up there with other good gunpwder greens we have had. Like most green teas, steep at 180 degrees for 3 minutes to get the best results. We go through a 3 pack of this stuff every single month.

review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Very smooth taste. Medium dark color. Great tea and brand. Economical. Assam can be a wonderful place to visit when calm. Off the well-beaten and ordinary tourist path. Beautiful people. Possible to take the train (or a flight) from Kolkata [Calcutta.] Large parts of Assam are blanketed with beautiful tea gardens. Stayed at a tea garden in Assam on one of my visits there. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. Also really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E268">Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>.

review/text: I've tried many green teas in the same price range, but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.  It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.

review/text: ****<br />This is a good, albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash. It is made from blended black teas. I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****

review/summary: High quality, organic!, a little flat
review/text: I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.

review/text: I am a long-time green tea consumer.  I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.  I like a fairly strong tea and usually grate fresh frozen ginger into my tea cup for extra flavor.  I steep a generous teaspoon of the loose leaves in 8 oz. of hot water (not quite boiling).  To my delight, the Jasmine green tea is always good with or without ginger.  I can use the leaves at least twice with good results.  The mild aroma of the tea is like jasmine blossoms and the taste has a sublte sweetness.  I drink at least 24 oz. of the tea each day.  So the fact that the tea is organic is a plus. The price is competitive.  I will buy this tea again

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice beautiful loose leaf jasmine tea. Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use.

review/text: Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx

I kept one for myself and I think it is going to last me awhile. Since I don't know all that much about teas, I can't comment much on the quality but as far as I know it is good! It seems comparable to the same stuff I got in the smaller jars. Recommend :)

review/summary: Excellent tea
review/text: This tea is absolutely delicious, my husband and I love it. It's very smooth and subtly sweet, and especially good mixed with a little green rooibos and a bit of white tea for a touch of caffeine. I haven't noticed any sediment in my cup at all from it yet. I have no complaints, I'm turning into a regular drinker and am signed up for Subscribe & Save. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Excellent English Breakfast Tea
review/text: I have been searching for the 'right' balanced English Breakfast Tea for a few years now. Other than actual English Teas from London, England, it was very difficult to find a rich and aromatic English Breakfast.<br /><br />After trying out at least 20 different varieties, including some very expensive brands, I've found this to be the perfect cuppa in the morning. Personally, loose leaf seems to taste a lot better to me, and I've not tried the tea-bag variety on this one.<br /><br />Hope others enjoy this tea as much as I have.

review/summary: I always come back to this tea
review/text: I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all. I no longer drink tea bag tea, only full leaf loose tea.  This English Breakfast tea by Stash, (full leaf loose) is by far my favorite and one I always come back to.  It has a nice body and aroma, yet never muddy.  Never bitter either.  I always add milk, never sugar, because to me, this tea has a natural sweetness to it.  It is clean & smooth, yet rich.<br />It has a perfect balance for my taste.  I cannot understand why some people only give this tea one star, maybe they just received a bad batch.  I will say that I have noticed slight differences from different batches I have received throughout the years.  I have been drinking this tea for 6 years now, and I love it.

What have been enjoying for a few years is a strong tea with milk.  Now I have discovered a tea that can be enjoyed straight.

review/text: My cat is not a huge fan. Sure, she'll lap up the gravy, but leaves the little meat-like bits as dry as a bone. It feels like saving money, but not if your cat is only gonna eat cornstarch gravy and turn her nose up at the meat by-products. It's probably fine for a grocery-store food, but a better quality food will make your cat happier and maybe healthier. Also I can't imagine gravy has got the nutritional content my cat needs.<br /><br />Pouches seem like a great idea compared to messy, annoying cans, until you can't figure out a way to get the stuff out of the package without getting gravy all over your hands.<br /><br />I switched to Merrick cat foods and my cat is happier--she doesn't leave lots of uneaten bits.
