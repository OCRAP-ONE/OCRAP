review/summary: Horrible Smell, Inconsistent Quality...
review/text: I picked up a box of these at either Target or the Navy Exchange...can't remember. They are absolutely terrible though. The smell alone is enough to make you want to toss out the entire box, but I figured I'd at least try it. Thankfully they don't taste as retched as they smell, but they're still not good. I made two k-cups on two different days thinking maybe the first was just a bum cup...nope.<br /><br />My husband went to make a cup and he remarked right before putting the cup in the machine that it felt and sounded empty. Well, all he got was water with the slightest tint of brown to it. He tried a second cup...same thing happened. He finally said screw it and put in a k-cup of decaf coffee...came out perfect, so it was the cups that had the issue, not the machine.<br /><br />I absolutely do NOT recommend these. I can't compare the smell to anything, but it's truly disgusting. There has got to be a better cider k-cup out there somewhere. For now I'll just stick to my packets of cider mix that require some hot water. At least they have a pleasant smell, and actually taste like cider!

review/summary: Okay if using right after purchasing, but....
review/text: I loved these when I ordered and used them last year.  I kept an extra box in a cool, dry place over the summer.  When i went to make a cup tonite, was dissapointed that it simoly tasted like hot water.  Figuring that it might have been just one pad pod, tried FOUR additional pods with the same result.  Checked the box and expiration is next month....but no warning on the mix evaporating in the cups.  What a waste....very dissapointing since i had thought this was a great drink to curb cool weather munchies.

review/summary: Smells good...
review/text: I had high hopes for this, despite knowing from reviews here that it contained a sugar substitute. I love hot cider, and especially caramel cider. It smelled great brewing but when I went to take a sip -- ick! The artificial sugar makes this intolerable for me. People who routinely use stuff like Sweet n Low will probably love this. Me, I'm just glad I got this in a sampler rather than buying a huge box as I was tempted to do. Grove Square needs to offer an option that uses real sugar because I think they got it right otherwise. Disappointed. Wanted to really like this.

review/summary: Horrible.  The worst k-cup I've had by far.
review/text: I've probably tried 40+ (maybe more than that) k-cup varieties thus far and this is the only one that is just plain horrible.  The powder rarely comes out correctly (and the fact that you are talking about a powered cider should stop you right there), it has a far too-sweet taste, and well, frankly, it just tastes bad.  My wife and I found the Green Mountain naturals Cider cups on clearance locally (we liked them so much we went back and bought like 16-18 boxes), but I have problems with sugar so I thought I would try this.  Bad idea.  It is borderline undrinkable.  It is, however, better cold than hot, but that's not saying much.  Low price, low quality.  Even the physically cup itself isn't made as well as the "real" k-cups.  It is made to fit in a Keurig brewer.  It is not a true k-cup.  Note that the title says "for Keurig K-Cup Brewers".  It is worded that way for a reason.  Avoid like the plague.  If you can handle sugar, check out the Green Mountain version.  If you can't, well, I've not found a better choice either.  In fairness, apparently everything this company makes isn't horrible.  My wife loves their Peppermint Hot chocolate.  Neither one of us can stand this crap however.

review/text: I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners, but this product really isn't that bad. There really isn't an after taste and not as intense as I thought it would have been as some of the reviews have made it out to be. The flavor is not amazing, but not bad either. I was expecting a little more zing. All in all, I paid 9.99 for 24 cups and I am not disappointed. Yes the "natural" and "real" product is better (I have tried both), but if I see this product at that good of a price again, I will definitely buy it. 3 out of 5 stars for value and taste (yes it's still enjoyable).

review/text: I was very hesitant to order this product because of the negative reviews. I'm so glad that I went ahead and ordered because it is so tasty. It's warming and relaxing on a chilly fall day. I don't ever drink anything that is sweetened with sugar and I am used to the flavor of aspartame so I found no odd flavors in this at all. I also bought the natural apple cider ones made by Green Mountain Coffee from my local BB&B because they are so expensive on Amazon. I found that I actually don't like those as much as the Grove Square. They are very acidic and don't contain any of the delicious seasonings. If I doctor up the plain apple cider with a shot or 2 of Torani sugar-free brown sugar and cinnamon flavoring then the Green Mountain version almost tastes as good as these Grove Square cider cups. If you regularly use artificial sweeteners in your beverages then I don't think you will be at all disappointed in the flavor of the Grove Square Spiced Apple Cider Cups.<br /><br />As a side note, I always clean out my used K-cups in order to put them in my recycling. Because they contain an instant powder, there is nothing left behind in the Grove Square cups. The Green Mountain apple cider cups contain a really gross mush of nasty reconstituted apple. It's a little off putting.

review/summary: Terrible! The cups were empty!
review/text: I was so disappointed!  I received the cups and tried one right away.  It was like hot water.  The cups felt empty so I opened one to see.  The "cider" had melted or something, causing the cups to be empty.  I thought maybe one or two could be bad, but it was the whole box!  Soooo disappointed!

review/summary: I disagree.
review/text: All of the other reviewers seem to be in uproar.  I understand the statements knocking the "caramel" flavor, it is admittedly not very appealing.  The Cider flavor on the other hand is wonderful.  In fact, I would go to say that the Cider K-Cup is my favorite K-Cup product.  My family uses our machines daily (sometimes hourly) and when we have it, the Cider pack is one of everyone's favorites.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that it's taking 3-5 weeks to ship at the moment!

review/text: I am not sure why all the negativity about this product. I think it tasts pretty good....even my husband thought it was good; better than the spiced cider and he is pretty picky. a good drink for a cool, fall evening or winter day. We have our own well and only use well water or botten water which has no chlorine in it....I think if you are on city water and using city water it would definitely alter the taste. My daughter and son-in-law, and my colleague also enjoy it. I tried my colleagues and am ordering my own.

review/text: This product works fine in my Keurig coffee maker... I just do not personally care for the flavor.  It is VERY sweet - - tastes pretty much like most instant cider mixes. For me, making it weaker improves the taste.  Again, the product works fine; my 2-star rating is based mostly on my personal dislike of the flavor.

review/summary: Take the bad reviews seriously....
review/text: I am addicted to caramel apple cider - and being only 10 calories and fairly inexpensive, I wanted so much to like this product. I thought even if it wasn't the best cider I'd ever had, it would at least be a good enough substitute for when I was watching my weight and couldn't afford to go to Starbucks. I was so wrong - what a waste of money! First off, it smelled so bad that it made me nauseous. I brought it to class with me, and was worried the whole time that everyone around me could smell it. Then, the taste was unbearable. I took a sip, gagged, tried adding some fat-free whipped cream, sugar-free caramel syrup, and cinnamon - still disgusting, the awful cider taste overpowered anything I put in. Needless to say, I wasted $10, will be throwing out all the k-cups, and will have to look for my cider fix elsewhere. Take the bad reviews seriously - I wish I had!

review/summary: Best SF hot drink EVER!
review/text: I was a bit leery when I ordered this product but it is fabulous!  No aftertaste at all and if you set it on a smaller cup, it is just the right strength--not too weak at all.  I do doctor it a bit though.  Before I brew, I put about 6 cinnamon red hots in the cup, along with a cinnamon stick.  Then when done, I add a light sprinkle of my own mix of cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Almost as wonderful as my freshly simmered REAL apple cider!  The "caramel" part of this drink is what really makes it yummy!  Perfect for that cool autumn night, or anytime.  Highly recommend this drink!  And the price is wonderful too.

review/summary: Very Bad Taste
review/text: This product is made with aspartamane, but that doesn't bother me. I only drink diet sodas instead of regular ones whenever I have the occassional soda (try to limit it to 1-2 a week) so the taste doesn't bother me, I also use Stevia and Spenda at home so I'm accustomed the the different sugar-free flavors.<br />I had such high hopes for this drink. I was looking forward to having a cup of hot cider at work. Granted I didn't think it would taste like real cider but I'd been looking forward to a hot apple-y drink.<br />When my shipment came in I brought it to work and had my first cup. Immediately I could smell it. It smelled really good at first. If you put your nose too close you can smell kinda a sickly-sweet scent. I tried it and nearly spat. It tasted extremely chemically and entirely overwhelming. The "caramel" was caramel only insofar as what a machine can reproduce. It was not caramel as I was expecting, not even slightly.<br />I tried letting it cool and drinking it cold. It was perhaps a teensy bit more palatable.<br />I tried watering it down. That helped. The Keurig at work only goes to 12 ounces. So perhaps ones that go to 16 ounces might diffuse the flavor a little more. This is why I gave it a 2 star instead of just 1.<br /><br />Now these things just sit forgotten in a drawer. Maybe I can figure out something to do with them...

OFfers a variety to the keurig k cup line up besides the usual teas, coffee cocoa etc Hot cider is a fave  of mine so I decided to try the carmael apple first I do plan on coming back to buy more of these and to try the spiced cider variety of these too. Excellent product will recommend to family members and friends.

review/summary: TRUE MEXICAN/CEYLON CINNAMON!!!
review/text: SO HAPPY!!! I ordered Mexican cinnamon from two other vendors and was dissapointed to find they sent me cassia (the type predominantly used in USA & in just about every grocery store). The two are not interchangeable (unless in dire straights). They have similar but different flavor profiles, Mexican/ceylon is sweet, Cassia/US type is not. They are two different species. Mexican/ceylon is beige/light brown and looks like bark, unravels easily, is chewable straight from the bag and is able to be broken. The view from the side is many layers resembling a cigar. The other is very dark brown, hard and would likely break a tooth if attempted to be bitten even after soaking, is intensely hot in comparison and from the side is a single layer that resembles binoculars.<br /><br />This Mexican cinnamon is delicious! I just ordered another shipment.

review/summary: Marmalade purest
review/text: Being very far from a gormand; but one who is very particular about my English marmalade; I would have to say that about the 3 biggy of the Brit variety that Duerr's would be the best both in taste; in the amount of the peel; and the prices as well actually.  For more years that I care to count Dundee used to be my favorite but like another chap said; Dundee changed the receipe and it is just not any good anymore & I would venture to say, if I was a Brit I would be ashamed to call it my own.  The colour now is off, no peel to speak of and well, getting rid of the white pot for common glass was just the straw that broke the camel's back.  I tried to write the blokes to express my dismay and they did not even have the courtesy to reply.  Lots of people rate Chiver's high and it is alright I suppose but my penny's on Duerr's that is for sure

After my dog's veterinarian told us about the food, I started her on it and after a week on it she stopped vomiting...that was four years ago. The dog treats are the same as the kibble. They come in two different sizes (small for small dogs and puppies and medium for medium sized dogs). My dog is 47 pounds and about 20 inches tall and I feed her the medium sized treats. Sometimes I find that the bone shaped treats split in layers so they are thinner than usual but my dog doesn't seem to mind.

The reason I like these plants so well is that they are more like real plants than most aquarium decorations that are either too flimsy to hold up anything at all, or too stiff and sharp to look safe. The snakes love them, I have the tall plant against a branch, so it helps support the leaves, but the snakes like to coil around the stems and I find at least one of them in it almost any time I look.<br /><br />The problem with them - The stalks of the plant are glued into shallow 'divets' in the base, so there is very little surface area that keeps them glued together...thus they don't stay glued together terribly well. They would be more sturdy if they were glued into drilled holes. At least one stalk on every plant has come unglued (2 off of some of them).<br /><br />I knew they wouldn't support the weight indefinitely, and had they broken at a later point, I would have chalked it up to them outgrowing their plants. But four months seems like an awfully short life span, especially considering how expensive they are. I still really like these plants for their enclosure and will continue to use the plants and just try to re-glue them as they come apart.

review/text: i was so excited to get this item in...but when i got them in, my daughter tasted it & said that it didn't taste right.  so i tasted them & it was indeed stale.  even though the date on the package was expired, they had a really bad taste.  i have purchased chocolate covered sunflower seeds for my daughter before & she absolutely loves them...these on the other hand were not so good...will not purchase from amazon again.

review/text: I can't possibly give these little coated sunflower seeds enough credit for helping me eat them rather than inhaling some ice cream--but seriously--they are so wonderfully tasty!! They appeal to that craving I get for something crunchy/melty yet they are very delicious and good for me. These little gems are quite addictive (in the best sense of the word) and I HERE I am ONCE AGAIN back to buy more for the third time...without apology!:-) Sooooooo good!

review/summary: Unsaturated Fatty Goodness
review/text: I am a firm believer that nuts are an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, sometimes nuts are just plain boring to eat, but this mix actually add a little bit of chocolate, which makes the entire mix taste great. Don't be fooled by the high amount of fat because it actually contains a lot of unsaturated fat, which is actually good for your body.

review/text: This is one of my favorite snacks.  The small size is perfect for an afternoon snack, or to tide you over until a late lunch.  I keep a box at work.<br /><br />It's healthy like trail mix, but has a touch of chocolate and honey to keep you coming back.  Unless you're allergic to nuts, you have to try these.  You won't regret buying a case.

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: As a busy mom, I find myself running out of time, energy and good food choices pretty regularly. Usually when I grab something on my way out the door it ends up being convenient but full of carbs and empty calories. This trail mix, however, has a nice mix of healthy (yet tasty!) ingredients - whole almonds, honey roasted peanuts and sesame sticks, dark chocolate covered soy nuts, walnuts and pecans. The convenient, single-serving portion size is just right and is filling enough to leave you feeling satiated without needing another pack. Also, there aren't too many peanuts, which seems to be an issue with other trail mixes. I especially love the dark chocolate covered soy nuts which provide a hint of sweetness without being overpowering.<br /><br />The Daybreak Blend variety is really yummy, too, especially if you like a fruitier, sweeter taste. :) I keep a couple packets of the Daybreak Blend in my car since that kind doesn't contain anything that might melt.

review/text: Deeeeeelicious!!! Outstanding flavor packed in these little pouches.  Love the combo of lightly salted, & delicate nutty sweetness. Tender, yet crisp, light, and still filling/satisfying. These make a great lunch,or in between snack. Perfect!  Difficult to find in the store with the sesame sticks, (the ones with pretzels arent nearly as good& I love pretzels) great that Amazon has them at a reasonable price.  Thank you Amazon for carrying a great product.

review/summary: Love the mix - tasty but still pretty good for you!
review/text: This is the perfect blend of salty and sweet, and a nice amount of calories for a mid-morning or afternoon snack.  It is not overloaded with peanuts (too often used as filler for other nut mixes) and the peanuts are honey roasted (the preparation of peanut I like best other than boiled!).  I wish they had it in a larger tub (I feel like the extra packaging is increasing my carbon footprint) but it is cheaper if calculating price by the ounce than a 9 ounce container bought at a supermarket or drugstore.

review/summary: Not as strong as you would think
review/text: I had high hopes for this product producing Irish Creme flavored Blue Mountain coffee. The product instructions state that 1 tsp can flavor 1 lb of coffee beans. When used in this proportion the flavoring tends to be weak.  I ended up adding a little extra (about 1/4 tsp) to the ground coffee in the percolator for a 4 - 6 cup pot.<br /><br />I thought shipping was high as well for a 4 oz bottle.  The shipping is almost the same price as the flavoring ($7.80).
