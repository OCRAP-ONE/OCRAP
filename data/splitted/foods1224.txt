review/text: yea, so this stuff tastes like a root should. nasty. i mix it in with protein shakes, and then essentially gulp it down with a horrible scrunched look on my face. I definitely feel improved energy -which i never have of!- a welcome addition to my sometimes lacking diet.

review/summary: Lots of energy
review/text: I purchased a bag of the MACA and yes it is strong tasting, I put mine in with my muscle milk (vanilla flavor) and it is easier to chug down. The benefits out way the taste. I have told all of my family and friends about it and now they are taking it too. I have found that the powder gives faster results verses the tablets and you get more for your money.

review/summary: Definitely has an effect, but be careful
review/text: I have been taking maca capsules for several months now with no negative side effects, in addition to other supplements, i.e. Vitamin C, B, E & calcium daily.  This morning, I tried 1 tsp of maca powder in a cup of yogurt.  The taste was fairly awful, but I suppose it's an acquired taste based on what I am reading here.  About 20 minutes later, I took half a dropper of sublingual Vitamin B as I normally do in the morning.  Five minutes after that, I became shaky and nauseous & for the next 1 1/2 hours my body did everything it could to rid itself of what I had ingested. Without going into detail, suffice it to say it was not pleasant.  Judging from the other reviews here, however, this is a good product, so I may have just made a huge mistake mixing it with Vitamin B.  I am hoping that is all, but this strong adverse reaction tells me that maca powder definitely does affect your energy level in some way - hence the shakiness.  I have also since read that it is best to start with a smaller dose than is recommended, i.e. 1/4 tsp.  I am in perfect health & physically fit, so I don't have a preexisting condition that would explain my reaction, nor have I ever had a negative reaction to vitamins or other supplements. So......my belief is that this product does work as intended, & for that reason I am giving it 4 stars, but use it with a bit of caution.  If this helps even one person avoid my experience, then it's worth the time to post this.

review/text: I bought 5 bags of it thinking it would be great for working out, energy and it's protein and mineral content.  The first bag I opened was okay and I could tolerate it in shakes and sprinkled on food with hemp protein powder.  But when I opened the next few bags and shared it with a friend we both horrified from it's bitter and nasty taste.  I don't know if I just got a bad batch of this stuff.  I would only try one bag of it becausew now i am stuck with 5 bags of it!!

review/summary: Severe stomach problems
review/text: I have decided to try this based on good reviews. After about a week of taking it daily with a meal, I began experiencing severe, persistent stomach pains. I stopped taking the Maca, however I was still in pain for a few days after.<br /><br />According to numerous accounts found on Google, Maca should NOT be eaten RAW, which is what this product is. Apparently the only way this is eaten in Peru is cooked or in gelatinized form.<br /><br />As for the positive effects this is supposed to promote, I have not experienced any. This might be due to the short time I was taking this supplement, but again, the side effects prevented any extended use.

review/summary: maca powder is the "magic bullet" for menopause complications
review/text: Navitas Naturals Maca Powder is an effective, inexpensive answer to hot flashes and low lobido of menopause.  Just one teaspoon per day.  It mixes easily into a beverage, hot cereal, or use your imagination, perhaps as sprinkles on ice cream.  Some people like the flavor.  I'm one who prefers to hide it - and easily do so in peanut butter fudge. No side effects.  After suffering for over a year with flashes anywhere from 12 to 30 plus time per day/night, the maca straightened things out.  I gained improvement in 2 weeks, stopped flashing all together after 6 weeks. Stayed on it for about 4 months and have only  had to do maintenance doses in spring and fall ( light changes) for about a month to be fine all year round.  Even if I had to take it everyday it would be well worth it and easy enough.  As it aids in balancing/regulating hormones, men with low libido can take it too.

While I experienced all the symptoms as stated by others: increased energy, increased sex drive, lesser pms, we've yet to conceive. I've only taken it for a month, so maybe it'll take a couple more months to work. I'm taking it 1 tablespoon per day and I must admit I can't stomach the taste. I disguised it with gassy sweet drinks and chug it all down.

review/text: The first time i tasted this it reminded me of a malt shake.  I mix it with my protien shake and its tolerable.  I have tried sprinkling it over food and the taste is overbearing.  Smoothie seems to be the best way to have this powder.<br /><br />As far as energy and health benefits that remains to be seen.  I does have a tendancy to cause insomnia.  I drank some in a smoothie before going to bed and I had trouble sleeping that day.  Alertness and clarity is what I have noticed from using this product.<br /><br />It is by no means sweet. Bitter/malty/nutty flavor is what I would use to describe.  Navitas is definately the best value.<br /><br />If anybody knows what the recommended dosage/amount per day please comment.

review/text: I've been taking Maca for about 3 or 4 months now and I can definitely attest to its "masculine" powers.  Now I have not blood tested for it in a while but I definitely started feeling more "responsive" after about two weeks of taking it.  I personally take it post workout with BioChem Greens and Whey to aid recovery.  The other benefits are just "bonus" but I can't say I'm complaining...

review/text: I really love this maca powder.  It has a nice texture and tastes very good to me.  (I may be weird, but I like to take it in small amounts right off the spoon and love the taste.)  It's great in smoothies if you don't want to taste it.  Gives me energy and also energy of the root chakra kind if you know what I mean.  If your sex drive is low, give it a try for a few weeks and see what you think.  It seems to help with hormonal balance or something wonderful.  I take a spoon every day and sometimes skip a day or so if I can stand to, just to help my body stay responsive to the maca.  Wonderful stuff.  Keep it coming!  Is there such a thing as too much maca?

review/summary: weird flavor, good effects
review/text: If you can get past the oddly sweet flavor and the powder texture that prevents it from dissolving in anything (it's a bit like flour), then I think that this product gives good results.  I have been adding it to my smoothies, cereal (with soy 'milk' vanilla flavor), vanilla yogurt, and occasionally cookies (it's really fabulous in apple-oatmeal cookies) since June.  I notice a difference in energy between days that I do and don't use it.  Of course they also claim that it's good for hormones, skin, etc, but these things are a bit harder to know for sure.  I generally feel great though whenever I start my day with this stuff.  Add it to milky substances, especially those that are of vanilla flavor, and experiment with baking.  Just don't try to eat a spoonful.  It just sticks like glue to the roof of your mouth...yuk!

review/text: Good thing I did take it for libido, too. I have not noticed any energy level changes from it, except for the very first time I took it I felt a little jittery, but after that I felt no energy from it. The directions say to take a teaspoon of it, I did that and I felt only slightly more horny than usual, not a whole lot. Then I took a chance and used a whole rounded over tablespoon. That did the trick. A very large boost to the libido and even caused larger ejaculations, however because I was so amorous I didn't last very long, but it was the most fun I've had in a long time. So for libido, I like maca, but I had to take more than usual to get a desirable effect.

review/text: Navitas Organic Raw Maca Powder - It Works!<br />I have been using the Raw Maca Powder for a month now and I can tell you that it helps to keep me energized for the whole day.  I feel healthy good and not jittery.  I take it in the morning (1 1/2 tsp) mixed with a protein drink and get relaxing sleep during the night.  I have a desk job and I usually work out 3-4 times a week and eat healthy, but by the time 3p.m. rolls around I would feel like I'm done and would rather take a nap.  Since I've been taking the Maca I feel more alert and I'm able to be more productive throughout the day and still feeling great when I get home.  Keeps the love life going pretty strong too. Oh Yea.... I Like It!

review/summary: Maca, Yucka!
review/text: I thought I'd try this stuff since it got so many positive reviews.  Unfortunately, to me, it does not taste good either by itself or blended with something else.  I tried it in a berry smoothie and blended it into a green tea latte, and sadly, neither was positively augmented.  It does have a unique taste as other reviewers have suggested, it just isn't a GOOD taste.  I'm guessing a spoonful of powdered dirt would not taste much worse than a spoonful of this.  And the flavor is too overpowering.  You cannot sneak this into a smoothie without noticing it.  I'm glad I tried it, just disappointed I don't like it.

review/summary: It's supposed to be a good product
review/text: I have read all the benefits of maca, and love th idea of using it. I used to add it to my morning smoothies. However I have just read from one of the reviews that the root (this product) should not be eaten raw. Hmmm. I didn't know that! If that's the truth, I don't have any use for it, as I rarely cook anything with heat. I was getting it for my breakfast, which I just mix into a smoothie.<br /><br />I also went online and found this: Maca contains glucosinolates, which can cause goitres (enlargement of the thyroid gland) when consumed in high volume in combination with a diet low in iodine.<br /><br />So, apparently, if you have thyroid problems, don't use it, I guess. Giving it a good rating just because of all good things it does for us. Nut now I am not sure I will be adding it to my diet...

My case is really frustrating because it's chemical- meaning there is NOTHING I am afraid of or nervous about- I just literally wake up tense and full of anxiety every single day. I really don't like pill popping so have been looking for something more natural that I can take. After an episode of Dr Oz, I decided to do some research on Maca Root just for energy. I came across several people saying that it helped them with anxiety. Figured it was worth a try.<br /><br />I have only been taking a teaspoon/day and already almost all of my anxious feelings have disappeared. I wondered if it was just a fluke, however when I forgot to take it yesterday, I woke up today with all my symptoms back. I will NEVER go without this again.<br /><br />SO thankful for this product!

review/text: I am on my second bag of Maca, taking 2 tablespoons each morning. I like its weird bitter flavor (but then I like every vegetable on the planet, so don't go by me as to flavor). My purpose in taking it was to alleviate a borderline slow thyroid (medically diagnosed) and symptoms of adrenal fatigue (not officially diagnosed, but felt). Maca supposedly helps with endocrine functioning.<br />However, I have not noticed any difference. It has not hurt me, but has not helped either. After reading the other reviews, perhaps I should stop and read more about it.<br />Thanks to all commenters for sharing.

review/summary: Good in small doses
review/text: I decided to try Maca as it was recommended for my reproductive system issues. I recently decided to give up taking medications as they weren't helping with my reproductive system issues or my hypothyroidism. I have seen it in my local Whole Foods store for $20 a bag, so Amazon definitely has a great price if you get free shipping.<br /><br />I first tried 1/2tsp Maca in about 4oz of water. The taste wasn't bad at all. I noticed an energized feeling immediately, almost to the point of being jittery but not quite. I got on my elliptical machine and felt my workout went smoother and I felt better throughout the workout. The energized feeling lasted all day, though at times I found it to be a bit much. Clearly Maca is powerful and you need to start out very slowly with it.<br /><br />I have since been putting a 1/2tsp of Maca into a smoothie each morning that I split with my boyfriend. We use frozen fruit, unsweetened coconut milk beverage, 1tbsp maple syrup, 1/4c chia gel, 1/2tsp matcha powder, 1tsp acai powder, and the 1/2tsp Maca powder. It doesn't taste too great since adding the Maca powder, it has a strong flavor in smoothies unlike in water, but I force down the 4oz smoothie each morning. Since adding it to a smoothie and splitting it, I feel energized without the nearly jittery feeling.<br /><br />I have felt great, I've been sleeping through the night, I have energy during the day... it's fantastic. I'm also taking a few other things to help with my specific medical issues so I am not sure what is helping with what, but I do know the Maca gives me great energy, I can exercise without dreading it, and I no longer require naps or feel like I'm dragging in the middle of the day. That itself is worth it!

review/summary: excellent product for energy and wellness
review/text: It took some adjusting for me but I found that when I add Nutiva cacao to the blend that takes care of it. Maca really helps my energy and does all that the package describes.  I wouldn't be without it. Any time I have used the last of it with the next order not arriving yet I notice a dip in energy.  So it truly is a wonderful item to have one's diet program. I always use Nutiva's cacao with it and that does help modify the taste for those who have trouble adjusting to it.  It does take some adjusting but I'd not do it alone as some people have suggested who have rated it poorly.  I put it with my hot nut milk and then add Nutiva cacao to it.  Many times I will add Nutiva cacao and this Nutiva maca to my espresso coffee to give it all a little more zing.  It works in many nice ways.  I also use maca and cacao in my soy protein drink so I really do enjoy it.<br /><br />Additional info as per other comments I see people negatively writing:<br />I don't think it has serious impacts.  One review scared me off of it for awhile but I am back to using it at 2 tablespoons at most a day at times or even one tablespoon a day.  It is amazing stuff.  I don't think most are eating it raw but using it in combination with something.  It is a wonderful product but if a person is toxic in their diet habits or loving the processed food high acid diet, this product may not be for you as it is too healthy.  I would not be without it.  It gives me energy and is part of the zip I have for getting thru the day.  When I have been without it my energy is lower and I just don't do as well.  The nutrition of it has its merits.

review/summary: AWFUL DREAMS
review/text: I was using the gelatinous maca by the same company, but after about two weeks, I started having AWFUL dreams every night. I was waking up scared to death bc my dreams were so real. So I stopped taking it for 2 days, and I had no bad dreams. i took it again and the dreams were back! I did read that this is a possible side effect! I am done with it. It also made me feel sort of breath (like i had been running for a few minutes, even though I had not been!) Maca is definitely NOT for me!

review/summary: tastes disgusting
review/text: Even if I put only one teaspoon in a big smoothie, it simply ruins the taste. It is very bitter and dominant! I am sure it is a good product and it might even work and have lots of health benefits, so if you don't mind the taste, go ahead and buy it but I think I would buy the capsules instead (you swallow the good stuff without having to taste it).

review/summary: Not for first time users
review/text: Fast shipping and a great quality product.  However, if this is your first experience with Maca powder, then I would advise that you either buy the pill form or the gelatin version.  This is an uncooked, raw powder and although it is a high quality product, it does have a distinctive taste and consistency.  It is a bit tricky to mix into beverages or just stir into your morning yogurt.

review/text: Please do not let the reviews here that say the taste is awful keep you from getting this product. I recieved it yesterday and was very concerned it would taste and smell awful because some people said it did. This is not the case. It smells okay to me and the taste is not bad at all.  I was able to taste it right off the spoon dry and it was was not horrible at all but actually quite pleasant. Too soon to rate as far as effects but wanted to let people know they did not need to be scared of the taste.

review/summary: Decent product; not tasty
review/text: I used a teaspoon of this powder, mixed with my protein powder to make my morning shakes. The taste and smell of this product is not great.  This is why I mix it with chocolate flavored protein powder, cinnamon, soy milk or regular fat free milk. It has a musty, burlap sack tasting kind of scent.  Adding stevia or splenda to my shake helped improved the taste, however, the odor was still there. I noticed after about a week of adding this product to my diet that I felt a little more alert mentally and energetic after drinking it.  Not in a way that caffeine affects me, but in a positive way it helped me get my work done with less brain fog. My skin looked clearer and brighter without makeup on. It had zero affect on my libido. Some users mention its helpful for that, but it did not do so for me. I am not sure I will buy the product again since I know so little about it's benefits. After all, I can just take a super B complex vitamin and feel the same response, no?  But really, the problem with me is the taste.  I plan to finish the bag to see it's longer term affects  and see if they outweigh the bad taste.

review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!

review/summary: Weak, wimpy, worthless
review/text: This tea is weak at best when compared to other rose hip teas I have tried. The bags have no string and tag. The bags are the limpest and often fall apart while squeezing. The only brand of tea I have ever had do this. I drink 4 to six cups of tea a day of various types and this is a very lame tea.

review/summary: Distinct Odor but I Really Like It ..
review/text: This tea has a strong pungent smell that my husband hates (he says stinky socks) but call me weird I really like it.  I like parmasean cheese too though and that stinks.  Anyhow, I find both the aroma very relaxing and find that after a cup I am tired and ready to go to bed.  I am not even sure if it is the aroma or the actual tea that is knocking me out but for some reason it is so right for this body.

The pack of 3 is a wonderful deal as well.  Had to get creative with storing so much tea in my cupboard, but for the amount you get, the price cannot be beat. Highly recomended!

review/summary: Suggested by Dr. Oz
review/text: This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better. I suffer from insomnia<br />so I bought the wheat germ, Chia seeds and Valerian tea he said would help. Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost "manure" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said "Oh, that's not bad!" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!

review/text: I did a little bit more research online before taking this tea...One time I bought Senna tea out of the blue, just for the heck of it...and decided to drink it one night and the next day I was exploding downstairs.<br /><br />So I decided not to do the same with this one. This tea should be taken carefully. It is used as an immune system booster. I think drinking it four times a week is good enough.<br /><br />I really enjoy the warming up effect it has. Although it is suggested to drink with a meal.
