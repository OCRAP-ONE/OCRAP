review/summary: Excellent Whole-Bean Coffee.
review/text: Somewhere along the line I switched from ground coffee in a can to whole bean coffee that you grind yourself. There was no turning back. From that time on the only question was what kind of whole bean coffee. I've tried dozens. Finally, I settled in on Trader Joe's Columbian Supremo. It was excellent! However, I found myself running out with no trip to Trader Joe's in the near future. So, I picked up a bag of Starbucks French Roast while visiting my local discount store. Starbucks was excellent, wasn't it? I've always thought so in their shops.<br /><br />This Starbucks French Roast Coffee is quite good. I might prefer a slightly less robust roast, but that's just a personal preference. What I notice about it more than anything else is that when I have guests over and serve coffee, I always get compliments and they want to know what kind of coffee I'm serving. I guess the wonderful aroma and the robust good taste just overcomes them. Well, that's worth something, isn't it? Personally, I might go back to another purchase of the Trader Joe's Columbian, but this is quite an excellent coffee, without question.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This is honestly the best tasting cereal out there.  It's plenty chocolately, which also means it's quite sugary, but surprisingly, its sugar content is 8g per serving, which is less than a lot of cereals (specifically, the sugary kids' cereals).  Depending on how you feel about sugar, I wouldn't count on it being a "healthy" breakfast food, but it sure makes a tasty one.  It's also an excellent snack.  I hate to admit it, but I can eat (and have eaten) a whole box of these in a single day - by myself.<br /><br />Regarding the gluten free issue - all the boxes I've received (and have purchased in local stores) say on them that they are gluten free.  I believe that the other reviewers are taking issue with the ingredients list posted on this product description page, as opposed to an ingredients list directly from the box.  This is, therefore, not an issue with the Chex, but with Amazon's description.  The ingredients list is posted online by General Mills here: [...]

review/summary: Chex (Except for Wheat) are GLUTEN FREE
review/text: Chocolate Chex are GF.  All Chex are GF.  They are produced in a completely gluten-free facility.  I got VERY sick from some recently (I have celiac disease), but it was because I got so giddy in the store when I saw that Chex were gluten-free, that I forgot to check each box I bought.  I bought one box that said "gluten-free" and one that didn't.  I got extremely sick from the one that didn't say it...because it wasn't gluten-free.  There are still boxes from when Chex weren't GF on the shelves. Also, the "malt" flavoring in the ingredients is not from barley.  Check your sources before you post that online.  :)  It's rice malt which is very different, and very gluten-less.<br /><br />I LOVE CHOCOLATE CHEX!  They are absolutely delicious, with the perfect amount of chocolate.  They make the milk delicious, too.  I don't like them for breakfast, but I LOVE them in the afternoon.

review/summary: Deceptive Advertising
review/text: Chex has recently gone through a confusing period-- especially if you are CILIAC.  My local grocer carried Chocolate Chex, which originally were CORN or CORN and RICE in composition.  Then some pencil-pushing office nerd decided that no, we should change the recipe to ALL RICE. The rice-only product leaves me feeling bloated.  So I went to Amazon, read the product description very carefully, saw that it was the corn/rice blend,and ordered a crate.  I was not happy to find that the product they shipped to me was ALL RICE.

review/summary: Lists Malt -- That's NOT Gluten Free
review/text: This comes up on Amazon as being Gluten Free, but as a mom of a son with celiac, I always read the ingredients. This description has malt in the ingredients, and malt is made with barley, which has gluten. These may be wheat free, but not gluten free if the ingredients list is correct. Maybe ingredients changed, but I would not suggest this to anyone on a gluten free diet.

review/summary: Inadequate advertising. . .
review/text: There are two different types of Chocolate Chex cereal. The pictures on the front of each one is different.  There is this picture and the other one has woman raising a bowl in the air.  Even though this box of Chex Chocolate cereal indicates it is the same as the other box, the recipes for each one.  For instance, this Chocolate Chex uses molasses and the other one uses brown sugar.  There are a couple of other ingredients that are different, but I don't remember what they are.  The appearance and taste of the two cereals are different.  I DO NOT LIKE THE CEREAL WITH MOLASSES IN IT.  I LOVE the cereal with brown sugar.<br /><br />So this is a cautionary tale that just because the boxes say they contain the same cereal, make sure to compare ingredients to be sure.

review/text: I love this cereal.  Unfortunately, Amazon does a disservice to the GF community by having a factually inaccurate ingredients list. All Chex, except for Wheat and Multi-Bran, are certified GF and DO NOT have barley malt.  The flavor of this cereal is really good - not too sweet, and just chocolately enough.  It does get a little soggy after awhile, so if you're a slow eater with a texture issue you may not love this cereal.  But it's definitely a great, inexpensive option for those of us who've been paying so much per cereal box that cereal became a treat instead of a staple!

However the management of my neighborhood grocery store tell me that it's no longer available. I'd like to know why the distributors have chosen to confine this product to web distribution status. That's the big problem - the distributors are deciding what they want us to eat, instead of simply supplying us with what we want. Let's get it back on the shelves.

Ingredients are:<br /><br />Whole Grain Rice, Rice, Sugar, Fructose, Canola Oil, Cocoa, Salt, Artificial Flavor, Molasses, Nonfat Milk, Vit E, and BHT to preserve freshness.<br /><br />For those who are newly diagnosed Celiac and might have food sensitivities like corn & dairy/casein, you will want to stick with just the regular Rice Chex & spark it up a bit with fruit like bananas.  I can't tolerate the Chocolate Chex but my daughter can, as her system isn't as damaged prior to being diagnosed.<br /><br />These taste good, as do the Cinnamon Chex & Honey Nut Chex.  But we can't tolerate corn so we don't buy the Honey Nut.  The Cinnamon Chex are pure rice too.<br /><br />Hope that helps

review/summary: BEWARE - Peanut Allergy Sufferers
review/text: First off, I should say that I didn't read the ingredient list on this product as carefully as I should have.  As anyone with food allergies, I'm ultimately responsible for carefully reading all labels.  The peanut flour was clearly marked in the ingredients list.  I just wasn't careful enough.  My main food allergy is wheat, so I am always on the look-out for gluten-free products.  However, I'm also allergic to peanuts, though not deathly so.  This product includes peanut flour, which was a little unexpected in my opinion for a chocolate cereal that doesn't include peanut or peanut butter in the title.<br /><br />That said, the cereal is okay.  I was hoping it might be something like Special K chocolate, which was an occasional treat before I developed a wheat allergy.  Unfortunately, it was nothing like that.  There's a chocolate-like dust applied to standard rice chex.  It's artificial and it colors your milk like milk chocolate, more like sugary kid cereals.  I didn't think it was disgusting, just not my taste.

review/summary: Chocolate Chex Cereal
review/text: We love this cereal!  It is great for the Chocolate chex mix and basically thats what we use it for!  The only draw back is that I had to order from Amazon because none of the stores we have in town carry it anymore.  I'm not sure if this will be a seasonal thing or what but the Chex website needs to up date there "Where you can find our products" section.

review/summary: Great cereal
review/text: I wanted a cereal that was tasty, not too sugary, and could also be eaten as an afternoon snack. I think this cereal fits the bill on all 3 fronts! It's got a bit of chocolate in it, but that's mostly just from cocoa powder, so it's not too sweet. The carbs aren't too high and it has some fiber too, so that's good. I like the conveneince of buying 6 boxes at a time, I take some to work, and some for home. It's a win-win!

review/summary: Yummmmmmeeeeee!
review/text: I bought my first box in the store when I saw it was gluten free.  I loved it, but, oh so expensive (and there really isn't that much cereal in there, considering the size of the box).  Still, it was SO good, I wanted MORE!  I was happy to find it on Amazon AND on the subscribe and save program.  This cereal is great with milk, but, it is also delicious dry as a snack or part of a packed lunch.  A great "healthy" way to eat chocolate.  As for the folks who complained because it is no longer corn and rice...well, some Celiacs and gluten intolerant folks are also allergic to the protei<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ51YE">Chex Mix Chocolate Cereal, 14.25-Ounce Box (Pack of 6)</a>n in corn and cannot have anything with corn in it, either.  (I can't use cornstarch in anything I bake for one of my friends).  So, overall, taking out the corn makes this cereal safe for consumption for a larger number of food sensitive folks!

review/summary: So-so cereal
review/text: I was thrilled to learn that General Mills began offering gluten-free rice chex and corn Chex a while back.  And being a chocolate lover, when they also made Chocolate Chex gluten-free, I could not wait to try it.  It was quite a disappointment.  To me at least, the chocolate flavor seemed to be just that - flavor - not what actually tastes like real chocolate.  It's not awful, and I won't have a problem eating the whole case of 6 boxes, but it'll be just a bit at a time until all the boxes are gone.  I don't anticipate purchasing more of it.  I truly wanted this to be a 5-star product - it just isn't.

review/summary: PEANUT flour as ingredients??
review/text: Chocolate Chex is yummy and gluten free. Perfect for our house. I brought them to school as snacks for my 3 yrs old and another child had some and had a big reaction. Upon studying the label more closely, one of its ingredients is PEANUT FLOUR! What is peanut flour and why would they put such a high allergen "food" as part of the ingredients? My kids are normally allergic to peanuts too but probably not sensitive enough to trigger a reaction (but the other little boy did).  I am just surprised to find that

review/summary: This cereal is crap!
review/text: I don't eat cereal, but I bought these for my kids for a break from the healthy cereal I always buy them. I do however remember eating Chex as a kid and having it in Chex mixes. The cereal however is not the same as it used to be. The squares are so tiny now and they are flat instead of hollow like they used to be. Once milk hits them they get soggy instantly. I definitely won't buy this again. Guess the kids will have to stick with old fashioned and steel cut oats.

review/summary: CAUTION: MSG in Chex Products; Read Labels Carefully
review/text: I like the "idea" of Chex products, however, many of them contain MSG -- a very dangerous additive for almost anyone. It's best to buy plain Chex (check the label) and create your own snack mixes, if that's what you use it for.<br /><br />Many "Gluten-Free" products are now being processed with additives that are NOT gluten-free (nitrites, MSG, soy, corn meal, i.e., more corn meal than gluten-free grains), which limits the purchasing options for GF safe foods.  I only submit this comment for that reason.<br /><br />Again, Chex in general is a good product, just please read the labels carefully.

review/summary: There is a difference between the Original and the Gluten Free
review/text: I knew when I purchased this Chocolate Chex, that I wasn't getting the original. But I was so addicted to the original that I bought this anyway, knowing it wouldn't fulfill my tastebuds.<br />I think it was in 2010 when they changed the recipe to Gluten Free and the only place I could find Chocolate Chex stopped carrying it last year. I found some of the Gluten Free at our local Big Lots and if you find it at Big Lots it's because the manufacturer is trying to get rid of it.<br />Anyway, as soon as they changed the recipe to Gluten Free, I contacted General Mills to let them know I didn't like the change. But that was pretty much a waste of time.<br />Ain't it funny how companies bend over backwards to please a Minority population?<br />And, leave the rest of us to do without.

review/summary: Great for milk and for making yogurt!
review/text: I make my daughter's yogurt since the only whole fat yogurt available in stores where we live is Stonyfield's, and they're almost $1/cup. The recipe uses 3c. whole milk and a cup of dry milk, which sent me on a search for a dry milk that was more nutricious than the plain old nonfat dry milk that most places carry. Nestle Nido Kinder was my answer: I like that it's fortified with so many nutrients that growing kids need, fiber was a huge plus since my daughter sometimes has regularity problems, essential fatty acids, and the taste is really good. My daughter also likes it mixed as a drink as well, and since it taste slightly different than regular milk, it's a nice change every once in awhile. I compared this to toddler formulas that are out there, and this has just as much nutrients for more than half the price (with S&S discount 30.7cents/oz. and Similac Go&Grow toddler formula is 76cents/oz. on Amazon). I've also purchased Walmart's version of Pediasure before I discovered Nestle Kinder, and they're also nutrient comparable, but Kinder is WAY cheaper than even a generic pediasure (it cost $1.31/8oz. bottle and an 8oz sippy of Kinder made with nursery water cost 40.6cents to make). I highly recommend trying this with your toddler if you're looking for something to supplement your child's diet that is also budget friendly.<br /><br />***Update from two years ago when I made this review: The price more than doubled! I was paying $13 for this 3.52lb. can with Subcribe&Save. I love the product still, HATE THE PRICE!!! I'm sorry, but I'm sure not making almost triple what I was so I sure can't afford to pay that much for the same product.***

review/summary: This stuff should be marketed to adults, too!
review/text: I recently received a free sample of Nido 1+. I'm not sure why (I don't even have kids), especially as the packaging was all in Spanish. However, I have purchased powdered milk from time to time over the years and I was curious about the taste of this Nestle product. Wow! Other than being slightly (but not overpoweringly) sweet, this tastes closer to fresh whole milk than any other powdered product I have ever tried -- and I've tried a lot of them. And it tastes GOOD. In fact, on the basis of taste alone I would prefer drinking a glass of this to regular whole or low-fat milk. That's something I thought I'd never say.<br /><br />I've tried it on cereal and oatmeal and again, it's better than the real thing. But the really big news for me is that it's also excellent in coffee. I'm a stickler for having real milk in my coffee and will only use that powdered non-dairy stuff when I'm desperate for a caffeine fix and there's no alternative. This stuff can go into your java in either mixed (liquid) or powdered form, and it makes me one happy coffee-drinking jitterbug. Who knew that the best powdered creamer is actually infant formula? (To be 100% accurate, this isn't marketed as infant formula, but as a fortified milk-based drink for young children.) Oh... my cats Chloe and Marmalade give it 2 paws up too.<br /><br />Now for the not-so-good news: Prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, it appears that, quart for quart, Nido is more expensive than either ordinary powdered milk or regular supermarket-branded milk. However, it is fortified with additional nutrients, including vitamins A, C, D, E, B6, B12, and K, along with Niacin, Folic Acid, Iron, Calcium, Thiamine, Riboflavin (all good stuff), and for some people (like me) that offsets the price disadvantage. Also, being a dry product, it should store well, so it's a natural as a back-up for the real thing or to keep on hand as part of your emergency supplies. It certainly makes sense for camping trips and backpacking.<br /><br />Now, looking at it as a coffee creamer, it MAY actually be cheaper than the detestable non-dairy powdered stuff that is sold for that purpose. I'll have to look into the prices to tell for sure, since it's been years since I've bought any powdered creamer. In my opinion Nido is far superior in taste (which, I suppose, shouldn't be surprising, as non-dairy creamer is, well, non-dairy, while Nido is made primarily from real milk). I also have a bunch of cold blended coffee recipes (you know, chocolate-caramel-mochaccino-type drinks) that call for powdered non-dairy creamer. It's hard for me to imagine how Nido wouldn't improve those recipes 1000%, although I haven't tried using it that way yet. Oh -- let's not forget about smoothies! A few scoops of Nido should add a nice creaminess to my fruit smoothies, and a nutritional boost as well. I think I'll try Nido in place of protein powder and see how that goes. I see from the nutritional label on the Nido can that four scoops (the scoop is included in the can) contains 6 grams of protein.<br /><br />I'm almost finished with my free sample, and I'm already planning to buy a big can of Nido 1+ when it's gone. Fortunately, the sample included a $4.00 coupon, so that really helps, but I'm pretty sure I'd be buying it anyway.  I'm not a huge consumer of milk (I buy it mostly for my coffee) and occasionally the milk in my refrigerator will start to go bad before I've used up the entire gallon jug. (Yes, I know I could buy it in smaller quantities, but the way it's priced at my supermarket, it's much more cost-efficient to buy the gallon size.) By using Nido instead of liquid milk, I shouldn't have that problem, as I can mix it up in whatever quantities I need.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this stuff tastes really good and has a great nutritional profile, so I don't see why Nestle seems to be marketing it exclusively as a product for little kids (hint hint). Why should they have all the fun?

review/text: My baby has arguably enjoyed this milk more than any other milk he's been given in his short life so far. I have tasted the milk and seen why he enjoys it so much; it's very creamy.<br /><br />The milk however arrived with a rather short shelf life, less than six months to the expiry date. May be it was the available stock as at the time I orderd but this was the only downside; otherwise, great milk.

review/text: I feel good about giving this to our 14 month old as opposed to regular milk due to all the added vitimans and prebiotics. He prefers the taste over regular milk as the taste is slightly sweet. The only thing I don't care so much for us the price that is constantly rising. When I started purchasing this it was only 13.00 now it's over 20.00! And that I over a span of only a few months! Some reviewers say thier local walmart carries this, but unfourantly ours does not :-(. Will keep purchasing and hoping the price goes back down.

review/summary: Great taste, Great Nutrition for Kids
review/text: My daughter is almost 3 years old and she had been drinking this for a year and she loves the taste. I mix it with some fresh milk and warms it up in the oven. We first tried this milk when we were on vacation in Asia and we ran out of Similac so we had to try another brand. We ended up with Nido and we couldn't be happier. Not only is it cheaper than Similac, it's also recommended for kids up to 3 years old. All the other toddler formula manufactured in the US go up to only 24 months. I love that my daughter can still drink milk made for her age since she sometimes is picky about what she eats but with Nido I do not worry about her not getting enough nutrition. She is very healthy, has strong bones and muscles and is very active. She is heavier and stronger than her best friend who is older than her by 2 months. And she is not fat at all. Just healthy.<br /><br />We had a problem with availability in the beginning since we could only find it at some Walmart Supercenters and not anywhere else. I had to stock up for 2 months each time I make a special trip to the only Super center closer by where I can find it. In some places online, the price is more than double so I am glad to find it on Amazon finally at about the same price I find at Walmart. And with suto-ship and free shupping, what me worry? Good job Amazon!

I did not read careful and when i try it, the taste is not that good compare with Europe versiont that I always use for my son. If you can buy that make in Europe, that would be better. Taste of Nido make in Europe more creammier, and less sweet (which would be less sugar.) Important that the nutrient on the cans show more for Europe version. I would recommend this product only if you can get them make it Europe. My bad for not read careful before i buy this :) so disapointed

review/summary: Good, but Dark & Sweet version is so much better!
review/text: Royal Brand makes the best pudding...and while their Cook and Serve regular Chocolate flavor is good--the magic is in their Dark & Sweet Chocolate one. Rich flavor, dark and creamy--regular chocolate (any brand) just seems bland and doesn't compare. I have been a long-time pudding connoisseur, having tried many different brands over the years in search for one as good. Dark & Sweet is my favorite and has been difficult for me to find for a long time. (my friends laugh, but I drive out of my way to find it when I am in a location that I know carries it--and when I find it, I fill my suitcase and stock pile it!)<br /><br />I have just heard that Dark & Sweet is discontinued...all I can say is, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Very sad...if Royal was smart, they'd focus on marketing Dark & Sweet as their only chocolate. (perhaps it was too confusing to offer two chocolate flavors? My guess is, due to lack of shelf space, many stores never bothered to carry both--in fact, when asked, many managers seemed unaware there even WAS another Royal chocolate flavor offered) If stores carried Dark and Sweet, and the public became aware of it, they would blow Jello and other lesser brands out of the water. True Chocolate lovers know the difference...and I know I'm not the only one!

review/summary: Silver Springs Beer 'n Brat Mustard
review/text: This is the closest thing to German Feuer Senf I have tasted in the US. In its own right, it is an excellent mustard with enough horseradish to provide a kick. The mustard has an outstanding taste, not too sweet like many other brands. The only problem I have with this product is not the mustard itself but the availability by Silver Springs. For many years it was available in large bottles from Sam's Club, etc. and now because of distribution, it is very difficult to find. For that reason, my current batch will be my last. The mustard is worth 5 stars, company distribution worth 1 star, total = 3 stars. I guess if the company refuses to make this product more available, it will die a slow death.

review/text: My co-workers introduced me to this mustard, and I love it.  Problem was, our local grocery store chain stopped carrying it shortly thereafter.  People felt so strongly about this mustard that they got together and order cases of it now and then, just so we can keep our supplies up.  How many condiments do you know of that can cause that kind of ruckus? :)<br /><br />It's a decent mustard with just the right amount of horseradish kick to it.  I'm not a fan of 5 alarm hot stuff products, but this one seems to strike just the right balance; not too mild, but not overpowering, either.  Great on many red meats and the like.

review/text: I love this soy milk. It's made with organic ingredients and tastes quite delicious. For people who are lactose intolerant and can't drink regular milk, this is a great substitute. It has the same amount of calcium and vitamin D as whole milk. One serving is 150 calories. The price is also reasonable. I can get a carton at my local Chinese supermarket for about $2, so with Subscribe & Save, the price is competitive. If you don't live near Asian grocers, it's definitely cost-effective to buy it here.<br /><br />I sometimes mix it with regular milk to dilute the sweetness down. Made in USA.

review/summary: Handy Stevia for traveling
review/text: This Stevia product is made by Stevita and is just a straight liquid sweetener. It doesn't come in all the flavors the way SweetLeaf Stevia does. However, the plastic bottle and smaller size makes it very convenient to travel with and have a spot or two of stevia in my coffee beverages at a restaurant. I noticed some say "yuck" and it isn't as sweet as perhaps SweetLeaf or the artificial sweeteners - but I'm so thankful it's even available. It is a whole lot less YUCKY for my needs, being based on natural herbal plant, and not on chemically processed "sugars" like aspartame or Splenda (R)(TM) or other artificial sweeteners. It just depends on your needs and if you are really serious about using a more natural product then you'll eventually get used to the taste of this (just as some take a while to get used to taste of artificial sweeteners!).
