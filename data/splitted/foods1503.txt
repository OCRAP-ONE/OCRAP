review/summary: Don't buy these if you can't eat tapioca
review/text: I specifically ordered these from Amazon rather than buying the ones at my local grocery store because I am allergic to tapioca, and there's appeared not to have any.  When they arrived, the ingredient list had an added on sticker to say that they now had tapioca.

review/summary: Frontier Fennel Seed Whole, 2@16 oz bags
review/text: Great pricing on this!  I use it as substitute for cocoa/coffee  in homemade rye breads, among other uses.  I'd become unable, generally, to locate fennel in local groceries--and the last time I had located any there, the small quantity was outrageously priced.  I note, also, that Frontier offers whole caraway seed, as well, which I've been very pleased with.

review/text: It came in a metallic style pouch but I expected as much. Can't complain with a price like that.<br /><br />It's fennel, the seeds seemed good quality and tasted like you'd expect.<br />If you never had fennel before, it has an almost smokey, licorice taste. It's very strong so you only need to use a little. I bought this for sausages, it should do very well in pepperoni.<br />I crust a few in my mortar, wow the smell hit me hard. Fresh stuff.

review/summary: Great quality fennel seed and price.
review/text: Fennel seed is a very versatile spice, whether you use it in whole seed form, or ground.  These seeds have very good, strong sweet and savory flavors, and I have used them successfully for making rye breads, italian sausage, both Mediterranean and Italian seasonings, and in ground form as a component of Chinese Five Spice.  It can also be beneficial for digestion and congestion when used in tea.<br /><br />I've gotten the most mileage out of these seeds by making my own homemade italian sausage (ground beef or pork, minced garlic, fennel seed, salt, pepper, and paprika or crushed red pepper, depending on how much heat you want), as store bought Italian sausage is nearly 2x the cost per pound, compared with ground pork or ground beef.  Save money and make Italian sausage yourself!  Also, don't bother paying $4 for less than an ounce of this spice at a grocery store, as you can get two whole pounds of great quality stuff here for under $10!<br /><br />Haven't attempted to grow these seeds, but will report back if successful.

I recommend not ordering these when it's 90 degrees and you're not home to receive the package.  I ate it anyhow and just loved the candy/nuts!  The nuts have a toffee coating and then chocolate on top of that.  You really don't even know you're eating a macadamia.  These are absolutely delicious, but not sure they were worth the high price.

review/text: How can you go wrong with dark chocolate covered macadamia nuts? You can't! Delicious! However, the packaging is deceptive. Like potato chips and other packaged foods, the package is more than 2X bigger than it needs to be. The excess packaging seems both wasteful and deceptive in that it makes it seem like you are getting more than you actually do. Pictures can be deceiving. I guess this will have to be relegated to an expensive treat for special occasions only. Otherwise, binge away!

review/text: I use cashew nuts in a variety of cooking such home cooked white rice, saut&eacute;ed vegetables or vegetable fried rice. It is very crunchy and yummy!<br /><br />The nuts are whole, plump but not very fresh! The problem is that the nuts are sent in plastic bags that are not vacuum sealed. The nuts get rancid if this is not stored properly. I stored this in airtight glass container and put it in freezer until use. Airtight container limits oxygen and slows oxidation process. Freezing also helps in that oxidation is slower at low temperatures, and stays fresh longer. You may also consider putting it in plastic bags and vacuum seal it and freeze until use.<br /><br />The nuts are priced good and delivered fast, but the seller could have taken extra care in sealing the plastic bags.<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002T4ZLO">Oggi 4 Piece Stainless Steel Canister Set with Airtight Acrylic Lid and Clamp</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001VQI5E">Oggi Ceramic Square Canister Set with Stainless Steel Spoon and Lid, Black, 4-Piece</a><br />3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I1P0YG">Oggi 8 Piece Round Airtight Glass Canister and Spice Jar Set with Stainless Steel Lids</a>

How can I tell if the nuts are rancid? I've heard that cashews tend to go rancid easier than other nuts, and that they should be stored in air-tight containers.  These nuts come in a little plastic baggie.  Anyway, they taste yummy.

What I DO though, is cook it up as a cereal according to the package directions, then put about 1 t Vietnamese Ground Cinnamon (this is the BEST cinnamon ever!!) for a topping. Yum!<br /><br />As for Bob's Red Mill, they get five stars for sure... I like their company quite a lot and use other grains they sell besides the amaranth. I highly recommend them.

review/text: I've been eating this daily for about a month now.  Because of its nutritional value, I was determined to find a way to incorporate it into my diet.  For me, two things did not work -- popping it like popcorn [yes it did pop, but it burned too] and boiling it as a stand-alone dish [it's not inedible, it's just not very good]. On the other hand, I add it to palenta [from Bob's Mills] or oatmeal.  With salt, olive oil and turmeric, it adds quite an interesting element to both.  It does have something of an earthy taste that I find pleasant when mixed with palenta or oatmeal.<br /><br />Let's acknowledge something, those of us who buy and try things such as Amaranth.  We are primarily into this for the nutritional value rather than the gustatory delight.  This does not disappoint

review/text: In all honesty I was not sure how to cook it or what to do with it. It has some "earthy" flavor to it, something between seaweed and Yerba Mate. It is about 60% less than quinoa so popping it like a pop corn did not work. Cooking it was rather easy, but direction recommends way too much water to use. You might end up with some sort of gravy.<br /><br />Bottom line, it is interesting alternative to quinoa that mixes well with milk or can be eaten as oatmeal substitute for breakfast. It has specific flavor that might take some time to get use to. Buying pack of 4 might be a stretch if you did not like it or did not find good application.

review/summary: I *love* Apple Jacks, but petroleum derived Blue 1 doesn't love me...
review/text: I absolutely love the Apple Jacks flavor, I could eat them everyday (IF I pick out all the green Os.. such a waste! )<br /><br />The problem is the green Os contain FD&C Blue 1 - a petroleum based artificial food color which for some of us causes GI issues ranging from mild: crampiness and irritability to full on GI WARS: including bloating, severe cramping, and worse including diarrhea; as the problem grows worse- bloody you know whats... check out the FDAs take on BLUE 1.. very interesting reading.<br /><br />Parents: if you aren't sure why your kids randomly seem to develop stomach aches, diarrhea, abdominal distress, bloating, cramping or worse - bloody stools, start reading the food labels of everything consumed within 24-36 hours prior to onset. A pattern will undoubtedly emerge...

review/text: There are several things that put this wet food in a class of its own:<br /><br />It actually looks good enough to eat. When Im 80 and can't afford to eat human food, this is the brand of cat food Ill be eating.<br /><br />You can see the ingredients. There are other gravy and chunks style wetfood, but the ingredients are clearly visible and appear to be of decent quality.<br /><br />I do not need a spoon to dish this stuff out.<br />My cat will eat 2-3 of these per day and I hate using a spoon to dole out the pate' style food. Just pop the top and give the can a few good raps over the food bowl.<br /><br />My cat really likes it.<br />He isnt actually that finicky, but he consistently finishes it and he seems very active and healthy.<br /><br />Buy a few cans and see how your cat responds. If they dont mind a chunk style meal, Im sure they'll love the meal.

review/text: We have a weekend "French" market in our community that has a good selection of locally grown fresh vegetables, hormone free meats etc.  There is a small chese shop that has a variety local and imported cheeses that has a booth at the market--I tasted the Le Delice de Bourgogne by Lincet the first time there two or three years ago.  I bought a chunk that that cheese.  I have bought a chunk at least a couple od times a month every since. I don't buy any other brie now just the Delice.  It has a wonderful greamy texture and and extraordinary rich smooth slightly nutty flavor.  I go in the off season to a local cheese shop for this same cheese.  We have perhaps 6 to 8 cheese favorites but this one is at the top of the list.

Perhaps not as much as Hickory Farms, but their summer sausage is quite delectable.<br /><br />The shipping was listed as 3-5 business days all the way through checkout and should have arrived by Monday at the latest after I ordered it.  I got a message telling me not to expect it until Thursday of the following week!<br /><br />With such horrible planning on SC's part, I will either order before I need something a week or more in advance or just forget it.  It's more likely that I'm going to say forget it and go with another company after being burned twice by Swiss Colony's outmoded and unnecessarily expensive shipping standards.  3rd class mail?!  Horrible.  Wouldn't a well-known company have established a flat rate deal with their shippers?

The Value Tub guarantees your dog will be taken care of when the End of the World arrives ;) Slip a few in the pocket, bring a dog travel bowl like this one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008CJ5N26">Bliss Paws Collapsible Dog Travel Bowl-Strawberry Pink</a> and you're off to the races!

review/text: This is a regular item on my shopping list. Now that I see they have them for online ordering for almost $10 less than at my local pet shop. I know where to buy them.  They come in a larger quantity and are less expensive, so I don't have to order as often as I would normally have to go to the store. My dogs will do anything for these healthy treats.

review/text: My 2 small dogs LOVE these.  It keeps their breath fresh and does actually minimize tartar build up on their teeth. One of my dogs is not food motivated and could care less about chewing on bones and chew toys. BUT, she goes absolutely nuts for these. They are not messy and the new formula digests just as well as their dog food. I give each of my dogs one per day so I buy them in these bulk packages. I highly recommend these.

review/summary: Dogs love them, but they're not healthy
review/text: Greenies tries to position itself as a healthy treat, but I'm not so sure.<br /><br />My dogs love them, but buyers should be aware that one of the main ingredients in Greenies is wheat, which, according to my vet, sticks to teeth like glue. In my mind this makes the product as deceiving as lip balm companies who put alcohol into their products. Buyers should also be aware of how much sugar is used in these products, which probably contributes to the high caloric value. I also take huge issue with the high cost and wasteful -- often non-recyclable -- packaging.<br /><br />Overall, dogs love them, but they really aren't very healthy. You're better off giving them a cheaper rawhide stick, which does a much better job of cleaning teeth.

review/summary: They do work, but this isn't a good deal
review/text: I bought "Greenies" after hearing rave reviews about them from friends. I buy all my pet supplies on Amazon.com and was able to purchase the value pack 36oz container when on a lightening deal ($22). My dog loves them, but she eats anything - I do think they help with tartar and her breath. My reason for 3 stars is because I don't feel like it is that good of a deal. There are not that many chews in the box and I thought I was getting a steal on them when I did. No one in their right mind would pay $130 for this container, I think even $35 is a ripoff.

Due to the price I usually just picked up one or two singles for a nice treat.  He loved them!  I saw them on Amazon and decided to be a kind pet owner and get him a box.  Everyday about noon he gets one.  I know when it's noon because he walks up to me and puts his paws on my legs and then turns circles.  When I say, "Do you want a Greenie"?  he goes nuts and runs to the cabinet where I keep them.<br />Happy dog<br />Happy owner

review/summary: My dogs love Greenies
review/text: Greyhounds notoriously have bad breath.  I first bought Greenies years ago when my first greyhound, Sophie, was alive.  She very much enjoyed these treats and her breath improved, at least a little.  Several dogs later, I was excited to bring a box of Greenies back to Mexico to give to my two dogs, Etheldreda - a greyhound, and Sadie - a greyhound mix.  I'm sorry that I can't find them in Mexico and I hate to ration out the Greenies because of the short supply.  Greenies are expensive, but they do help with the dogs' bad breath.  And my dogs love Greenies.

review/text: I love greenies as a treat for my American Staffy.  She has never gotten sick after eating these treats.  They clean her teeth and keep her breath fresh.  Unfortunately they are very expensive and even at a discounted price, at $1+ per treat, it is quite pricey.  I may look at comporable brands that are less costly, since she eats any type of treat thrown her way.  I am lucky that she is not picky.

review/summary: Bonkers over greenies!
review/text: We had a dog for nearly 16 years, who had terrible teeth and foul breath, and ended up needing surgery to remove 19 teeth.  She had infections under the teeth into the bone beneath.  She ended up with kidney disease and we lost her several months ago.  We now have a 1 year old pit/lab mix, Daisy, who will not let us brush her teeth, and I am determined to keep her teeth healthy.  Daisy gets one regular greenie (she weighs 57#) after her evening meal.  Daisy goes bonkers when I open the package, dancing all around the kitchen.  She loves them so much. Daisy gulps down her food, but the texture of the greenies forces her to take her time when she eats them.  So far her breath is not even noticeable, and her teeth are pearly white.  Also, I never give her wet food, which sticks to her teeth.  And, she chews on nylabones throughout the day.  Buying this through amazon.com saves me at least $10, so I am happy to get this online.  The packages always arrive on time and in good shape.  When the weather was very hot and humid here, I did get one box where some of the greenies were stuck together, but the individual greenies were still in good shape.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Not for my dog
review/text: The product does seem to work. If my dog has had a few of these over the course of a few days, her breath is noticably fresher. However, I walk her every single day, and she usually has to use the bathroom around this time. I do not give her Greenies daily, but I have noticed that every time I do give her one in the morning, her bowel movements are not formed well and very loose during her afternoon walk. This could well be a reaction in just my dog and not for others, but I would rather err on the side of caution. These just don't seem to digest well for my pup, so I will not be buying another bag. However, I cannot completely slam this product, as it did help her breath somewhat.<br /><br />If it matters, my dog is a 5 year old long-haired Black Cream Daschund. She hovers between 12 and 12 1/2 lbs.

review/text: My dogs bark at me every morning until they get their Greenie treat. They are addicted to them. I have 3 dogs so it is a bit pricey but that is why I order from Amazon so that I can keep up with their addiction! We use two different sizes of Greenies and the teenie size is good but then they want more than one. If I give them the size larger then I can get away with only one treat per day. I do not know what they put in these but my dogs are crazy for them.

None of the recommended chews nor treats did the trick, she plain refused them upon first sniff. I took a chance on the greenies based on some quick and dirty research, and am sure glad I did. She absolutely devours them in no time flat. For a somewhat picky eater (an extreme rarity in the world of Labs) these proved a fantastic purchase.
