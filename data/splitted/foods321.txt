review/summary: Smooth & Awakening!
review/text: Tazo Awake Full Leaf Tea is the best black tea I have ever tasted.  It is much better than the ground tea bags you would find in the grocery store (even of the same brand and type!).  It is very smooth, yet bold, delicious drank straight or with a splash of milk and a little sugar.<br /><br />The caffeine content is perfect to give you a little heart racing boost and get your day started.  I am not a coffee drinker so I use this as my morning wake up drink.  Love it and always have it on me, even when traveling.

review/summary: Great work and on the go tea
review/text: I am a big fan of drinking tea, and love a good earl grey.  This is one of the best earl greys you can get, unless you upgrade to the loose leaf teas.  It's great at work and on the go, where you don't have time or equipment to brew loose leaf teas.  The tea holds up well through a range of temperatures and doesn't taste as bitter as some others out there.  I recommend brewing it at temperature below boiling to produce smoother flavor (I usually add a little bit of cold water to the cup before pouring in boiling water to control the steeping).  The only downside is it's a little expensive for 15 servings.  Would recommend without hesitation to anybody looking for a decent earl grey.

review/summary: vanilla disflavored
review/text: The packaging is great for a gift.  The teabags are pyramidal in shape.  As far as taste, if you're just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla, then this Tazo brand will do it for you. If you're looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste, then the addition of vanilla at least in this brand of tea, Tazo, will disappoint you.  The raw rooibos taste, without these "improvements" such as vanilla, is full-bodied and has its own unique taste.  I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings, Republic of Tea, and Numi.

review/text: I love awake tea, but I am mad that you can't get the labels off the tin to reuse it. Nor can you compost the nylon bags.  The packaging is not earth friendly.  Even though I love the tea leaves less chopped-up, I buy the other packaging.  What's wrong with you Tazo? Starbucks?  It can't be that bad to use a different glue for the cute tins so we can store rubber-bands in them!<br />It can't hurt your profit margin too much to use another fabric for your tea bags.  As soon as you do I will be a loyal customer!

review/summary: Worst Rooibos
review/text: I tried this tea as my introduction to Rooibos.  I was very excited after hearing of the benefits of rooibos.  To my dissapointment I thought this tea was disgusting!<br /><br /> Luckily, I didn't give up and tried other brands (Numi and Yogi are great) of rooibos and they were all fantastic.  This tea has a stale vanilla taste that completely covers up the natural flavor of rooibos.  Stay away from this tea.  Plain rooibos without added flavors is perfect on it's own.

No other mail order has even come close to the excellent quality of Shatila.  And price?  Wow; tremendous value for the quantity.<br /><br />Harry and David?  Figis? Please, don't make me laugh. :P<br /><br />So far, I have tried the Mixed Pastries, Cashew Fingers, and Burma.  All are fabulous!  All received raves from my guests; so delicate; so fresh; so well crafted!  I need to give a special shout out for the burma; this incredible creation was hard to keep around for long; absolutely everyone went nuts for it.<br /><br />Mmmm, Shatila; anyone who lives in Michigan is very lucky to have such a fabulous bakery.  From 1500 miles away, I appreciate that even though I chose standard delivery, 6 days did absolutely no harm to the freshness of the items; they were so well packaged, and in such nice display boxes.

review/summary: Didn't like the flavor and don't order during warm months!
review/text: I didn't like this product.  It tastes like strongly-flavored puffed rice covered in chocolate and my first impression was "chocolate covered popcorn".  Mine was so melted it was soup and I had to put in the freezer to make it edible.  The melting and refreezing made it waxy and a somewhat unpleasant, unrecognizable mound of candy with which I had to literally peel the wrapper off.  My rating here is for the taste and texture only although it may or may not have tasted better if not ruined.<br /><br />*Also beware of ordering this if you live in a warm climate.  I don't enjoy receiving melted chocolate and had no other problems with any other chocolate melting that I ordered from other sources that month.  I'll assume it was the product ingredients making it susceptible to melting easily so it should have had special warm-weather wrapping when this is a problem.  Even though the vendor shipped more quickly than usual the product was ruined.  Many chocolate companies won't even sell their products during the warm months unless they can adjust to this problem and neither should this one. No refund or partial refund was even offered by the seller (O.E.I.) yet I was hounded constantly by them about my "seller review" per half a dozen telephone calls. I eventually deleted the seller review for reasons I'll not explain further. In my opinion, this is an over-priced waste of money.

Its a great addition to the 5 collection and would recommend this gum to anybody here who enjoys the 5 gum series. My only negative sight on this item would probably be the lasting time. Flavor only lasts about 10 min, or so then begins to fade.<br /><br />ALSO: Item has only 10 pack not 12, so I had to ask for a refund of $5.00. Be Careful!

review/text: Any true southerner knows of the ecstasy brought on by popping one of these salty treats in their mouth.  But only those of us that have left the south have learned the true value of the green peanut.  They simply do not exist outside of the south.  While their is no substitute for buying a bag of fresh raw green peanuts and boiling them yourself, the Margaret Holmes green peanuts are the best substitute one could hope for.  For those of you without the luxury of driving down the highway and pulling over to stop at a peanut stand this product is perfect.  The texture and taste are just what a boiled peanut should be.  I am not a fan of the cajun style myself so this classic  salted batch was just what the doctor ordered.

review/summary: terrible product, rotten, black goo-like substance in shells.
review/text: I recently, in July of 2011, purchased this brand at my local Walmart store.  I was shocked at the horrible quality of the peanuts,  wether it be in the can, one gallon, or in the new tear bags that can be heated in the microwave oven.  The different kinds of packaging was fine, how ever the quality of the peanuts was just awful at best.  So many were just empty shells (approximately 30%) many had black like goo where the peanuts should be in the shells.  They appear to go from the ground directly into the boiling pot.  The taste is pure dirt water with grit in your mouth!  The shells are actually very ugly to look at before you start to open them.  They are very dirty, some look like normal peanuts, some were pure black in color, some have a good half with the other half nothing but soft mush.  Some looked like they had molded in the shell and then afterwards they were boiled and packaged ready to eat!  The peanuts I purchased had a really bad consistency in peanut quality. There is a lot of shell material in the cans, it makes one think that the company never changes out the water the use to boil in, hence the large amount of dirty shell particulate in the product.  Some of the shells were so rotten, I did not actually like touching the product with my fingers!  That is bad! Even trying to pick them apart was terminated because they were just too mushy and the inside merged with the shell to form a mass that definitely was not going into my mouth.  I threw them in the garbage disposal until I realized that I needed to save the can to take back to the store so Walmart management could see what it is they are selling to the public.  I honestly think they will be shocked at the condition of the product that comes inside these cans of supposedly jumbl, green, boiled peanuts.  Thank you.

review/text: First I have to say I ordered and tried 5 flavors of the syrups from this company. I was so sick of maple ALL the time. So, as a general statement each flavor was very good, they were light but full of flavor. And though every person has different tastes and will like them in different degrees I found the following to be my tastes:<br /><br />Peach: even though i would not have thought peach would be my fav of the lot it was. it had amazing flavor and was not too super sweet. plus it went awesome w a bit of butter.<br /><br />strawberry: was really really good flavor nothing artificial about it just lightly sweet with great strawberry flavor.<br /><br />marionberry: had great bolder flavor, sweeter than the rest and thicker, closer to traditional pancake syrups but good flavor.<br /><br />red raspberry: i was expecting this to be my favorite and it was really tasty, even if peach did steal the show. however this was good and also light, though it had just a hint of an after taste.<br /><br />cherry; of all i tried this one had the lightest flavor, it was also more liquid like and less syrupy. it was light and delicious I liked it alot but for pancakes it seemed to soak right in and disapear a bit. i imagine for crepes or something this would be outstanding.<br /><br />the company shipped super amazingly fast in a strong sturdy box. each syrup was packed in strong material individually. I recommend them and plan on trying more of their products.<br /><br />PS- i also tried using these flavors with each other or with maple in double whammy of flavor on pancakes- peach and strawberry was really good, also marionberry and maple...

review/text: My dog is very picky and I spoil him all the time.  On his first birthday I bought him a nice cake with sprinkles on it from a very expensive high end dog store.  The cake was fresh made and he barely ate the cake.  It cost me like 25 dollars.  I found this at home goods and decided to try it for 8 dollars.  I have a little dog so I don't need alot of cake.  He only has a few dog friends and this cake was good enough for him and 3 dog friends.  And enough for another day to eat.  Yes its tiny but easy to make and my dog LOVED it!  I'm ordering more because its hard to find, easy to make, and I did try it to see if it was any good, it is very light in sweetness, icing is kind of bland but something bout the texture of this cake my dog and his friends loved. :)

review/summary: BUYER BEWARE !!!
review/text: I purchased this item as a gift thinking it was going to make a regular sized cake so cupcakes could also be made.  However, this only makes a small one serving size. Therefore, it was not good for the purpose of cupcakes. I emailed the seller to advise I was very disappointed as it was the picture that had led me to believe this was a much larger cake.  The response I received indicated "a .76 credit could be applied to my account".  I order from many, many catalogs as well as from Amazon and have NEVER been treated so rudely when I had any disappoint in a product.  Thank goodness the amount of my loss was not greater with this seller as I'm sure their customer service would not improve with price.  Again "Buyer beware"!!!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: From the picture that is shown, I thought this was going to be a full sized cake (8 or 9 inch diameter), enough for several dogs to share, specially given the price.  It is a tiny thing, barely big enough for one large Lab.  It smelled good and our dog loved it, but it seems like something you could easily make yourself.  So save your money, google a "canine cake" recipe, and you'll be much happier with the results.

review/summary: Not Like Typical Apple Juice But Darn Tasty
review/text: Most people will say that this does not taste like apple juice and I would agree, at least in the traditional sense of what typical apple juice tastes like. However, think about the peel of an INCREDIBLY sweet juicy red apple, and that's what this drink tastes like which to me is why it is colored red.<br /><br />Definitely give it 5 stars for taste. It's not your typical apple juice, but it's darn tasty!

review/text: It has a flavor that is addicting so if you don't want to crave a particular drink that isnt sold everywhere stay away, otherwise a very tasty drink. The ingredients are misleading but if you are an American, who cares it tates good and it's not too bad for you either, that's saying a lot for an American food product these days. I love this drink, fruit juice or fruit flavored, tastes good so I happy!

review/summary: Oddly colored pear juice
review/text: This drink was so weird, I had to review it.  The front says "Naturally Flavored Snapple Apple with other natural flavors juice drink."  And then "All Natural Snapple" and then there's a picture of an apple.<br /><br />The ingredients are: Water, Sugar, Pear Juice Concentrate, Citric Acid, Natural Flavors, Vegetable and Fruit Extracts (for color)<br /><br />First of all, the color is not anything that occurs in nature.  It's roughly the color of fruit punch.  And where exactly on that list are the apples?  It's pear juice, and it tastes like pear juice.  Which is fine: I like pears.  But why is it advertised as apple juice?<br /><br />It's also pretty disingenuous to make such a big deal about how natural this stuff is, when it's really just sugar water.<br /><br />So, no, I wouldn't recommend buying this.  Especially if you want real apple juice.

review/summary: Like taking a bite into an Apple!
review/text: I recently discovered "Snapple Apple" while I was in Boston on visit for a funeral. Snapple Apple has a unique taste to it... almost as if you are biting into a beautiful "Red Delicious" apple skin and all. I liked it so much I went back nearly every day I was at home to purchase more as I was not aware they sold it out in California where I reside. I am not sure what the other reviews are for since I didn't taste pear in my drink. I also LOVE the Snapple "Fruit Punch" which is quite refreshing as well when served crisp and cold from the freezer or from a ice bath (which is how I kept mine in the hotel).<br /><br />Respectfully Reviewed

review/summary: Not apple, but still delicious
review/text: Yesterday I decided to venture up to my cafeteria's snack bar. As I shuffled through the shelves of brownies, cookies, donuts, and cocaine I came across this uniquely colored Snapple juice like beverage. Assuming like any sane and rational person would that this was simply Snapple's own personalbrand of sheep juice, I decided to give this a try - I am, after all, a part time sheep herder and enjoy myself the succulent blood of some infantile sheep occasionally. After one quick sip of this beverage, I nearly dropped it in surprise - low and behold, the taste was not of my famed sheep blood, but of something else entirely! Wondering what it could possibly be, I quickly turned the bottle around and read the ingredients: Water, Sugar, and Pear.<br />Where is the sheep blood? I can't help but feel a little cheated after gazing upon the obvious color of sheep blood. However, this does not affect the taste at all, so I'll let it pass. Five stars in the taste category.<br />Oh, and there's no apple in here, either.

review/summary: The Best Vanilla I've Ever Used
review/text: After using Nielsen Massey's Pure Vanilla Extract I would never be able to go back to using cheap artificial vanilla. There is just such a flavor difference. In fact friends ask me to put double the vanilla in my baked goods because they crave the flavor. I use this in banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, custards and ice cream. Basically anything that calls for vanilla is better with this more expensive brand. In fact, I don't want to run out of it so I currently have four bottles. I guess I can't live without it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Best vanilla. Nothing else to say.
review/text: Yes this is very expensive but it doesn't hurt me when I pay 20 bucks for a bottle. The extract will make or break your recipe. It doesn't matter what brand of flour, butter, eggs, sugar you use but if the vanilla is cheap, it will ruin your creation or make it taste cheap. This is the best vanilla worth the price of saffron. It will taste like vanilla and will make your house smell like vanilla, no alcohol aftertaste. However, the price on Amazon varies so check your local prices before purchasing it. You might not even save anything if you just walk into Zabar's or any baking store.

review/text: I do the baking in my house. Let me make this short and sweet. This stuff simply makes whatever you're baking taste better. As a prime example. I have been making zucchini bread for months like theres no tomorrow. Everyone in my family has always loved it. I purchased a bottle of Nielsen Massey 4-Ounce Pure Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Extract here on Amazon. From the first time I used it I started getting new complements. "What did you do different. It tastes even better." "Did you change the recipe? I liked it before but this is even better." To me it really brings out a richer more complex flavor out of all the ingredients its combined with. At this point I'm out of zucchini and the bottle is almost empty too.<br /><br />Next time I will go for the 32oz bottle as its much cheaper by the ounce.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GE8N4Y">Nielsen-Massey 32 oz.

review/text: These oats are rolled, but they are thin, resulting in a creamy bowl of hot cereal. If you like a heartier oat, that keeps its shape, and is more "flaky" when cooked, then try Mother's Thick Rolled Oats: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZ8B0">Mother's Rolled Oats, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> We like the taste and texture of the thick oats, and they can easily be made into "quick" oats for recipies with one or two pulses in the food processor - so they are a more versatile oat. They also make chewier oatmeal cookies and a very nice garnish on top of homemade breads or muffins. Try Vermont pure maple syrup on these hearty oats for a real treat! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248A9HU">Butternut Mountain Farm Pure Maple Syrup, Grade A Medium Amber, 1 Pint Jug</a>

review/summary: Not as good as belly flops
review/text: I bought 10 lbs of belly flops a while back and those were so good and very sweet.  These jelly beans or not as sweet nor tasty. There seems to be a lot more root beer beans than any other ones.  They did not come in bags just a box of jelly beans.  The value was very good for the money, but in the future I'm only going to stick to flops.

review/summary: Read the ingredients carefully
review/text: There was a guy promoting these chocolate bars today and giving samples at Whole Foods. I overheard him talking about Stevia and I approached somewhat curious. He invited me to try some of the flavors and I tried a tiny bite of the almond and coconut. I remarked it was impressive that they were really sweetened only with stevia. If you look on the front of the package it says "Sweetened With Stevia". He smiled and nodded and told me about how fast they were selling them. Everyone loves them. I said great, I will buy 2 bars, and off I went.<br /><br />Now home with my reading glasses on I am reading the ingredient label.<br /><br />These are the ingredients on the label (of the Coconut flavor Lily's Dark Chocolate Bar:<br />Unsweetened Chocolate<br />Inulin<br />Dextrin (from non-GMO Corn)<br />Erythritol<br />Cocoa Butter<br />Organic Coconut<br />Milkfat<br />Soy Lecithin<br />Natural Flavors<br />Stevia Extract<br />Natural Vanilla<br /><br />Inulin, Dextrin (from non-GMO Corn) and Erythritol are featured a little too high on the list to make this food product I would consider. Hardly a "whole" or "natural food" in my opinion. Dextrin (which I had to Google and is made by heating Corn Starch at a very high heat over an extending time and seems to be used in pyrotechnics and firecrackers, among other things) is the 3rd ingredient! Notice where Stevia is on the list. It seems that Erythritol is the primary sweetener, which I guess sounds a lot less sexy. Stevia people associate with the herb, even though the extract is highly processed.<br /><br />Read carefully before you buy, even at Whole Foods Market.<br /><br />It seems this product is being marketed in 2 primary ways:<br />As an "all natural" and "sugar free" Stevia Sweetened Chocolate Candy Bar & through an association with the namesake, a little girl named Lily who had brain cancer as a child.  "The company gives a portion of profits to non-profits that help childhood cancer survivors in honor of co-founder Chuck Genuardi's niece Lily, who battled childhood brain cancer.".<br /><br />Of course it is wonderful that a portion of profits will help childhood cancer survivors in Lily's honor. And it feels good to have our buying dollars support a good cause. I would just like to know what that means a little more precisely. Like, what portion of profits and how will it help "childhood cancer survivors"? If you are making an association like this, make it clear to make it credible. Again, I am not implying any wrong here, it's just "fuzzy" and more so because of the ingredient label as far as I'm concerned, and the way it is being promoted.

review/summary: Best Dark Chocolate Bar Ever
review/text: Lily's dark chocolate bars are clearly made from high quality chocolate. There's only a tiny bit of dairy, and the sweetener is stevia, among the few healthy sweeteners. Despite being healthy :) these bars are as good or better than the not healthy ones. I prefer them to the famous name bars, as does my husband who likes the Lily's bar that has almonds (also good for you).

review/text: Lily's claims you get all the flavor with a quarter fewer calories. And it's true. Their chocolate is as good or better than any premium chocolate I've tried. Lily's comes in four flavors: Original, Coconut, Almond and Crispy Rice, and I've tried them all. My favorite is coconut, but they're all great. If you crave chocolate but wish you could get it without all the calories, you're in for a real treat.

review/text: This matcha tastes a little bitter because it's not the highest quality, but it's awsome for MANY things.  If you mix up a large batch in cold water and let sit in the fridge overnight, you'll have cold brew matcha with little or NO bitterness.  Very smooth flavor when brewed that way.  I make about a gallon at a time and when I pour some I add a splash of milk that gives it some substance and really enhances the other flavors.  Also it works great for making any type of green tea dessert.<br /><br />however...<br /><br />THIS SELLS FOR $5.00 IN THE STORE.<br /><br />Do not pay 15+6shipping = $21!!!<br /><br />Hell if you contact me i'd pick some up and send it to you for like 12 bucks.

You might need to test the strength amount you prefer.  The price is great for the amount of tea you get! I would recommend this to whom ever likes green tea.

review/summary: CHECK YOUR LOCAL ASIAN STORE FIRST! CHEAP IN STORE!
review/text: lol, I read that this item was cheaper in stores and almost bought it here.<br /><br />I am so glad I checked out my local oriental market first.<br /><br />I bought it for 8 dollars at the Asian store.<br /><br />Even on eBay this is expensive. It also is not from Japan, it is from Taiwan. Still good.<br /><br />All you need is 1/2-1 teaspoon for a cup of tea or to put in anything like juice or non-dairy milk (like Rice, Almond or Soy milk). I personally tried 2 teaspoons and I could not sleep LOL! 1 tsp is enough for the whole day.<br /><br />You can also put it in just about anything.<br /><br />This also looked a bit low grade (faded green color), but oh well the higher grade is so much more expensive.<br /><br />This went down good with a chocolate flavored drink I have (called Ensure)!<br /><br />Though I question if this is Matcha... I mean it tasted like green tea. I'd have to try another Matcha brand to see if this is real. I read one a matcha website that the brownish green tea is imitation Japanese matcha from the Chinese or Korean and well... someone said how this mostly has Chinese writing on it, and it's from Taiwan! Then, there is even imitation matcha from the Japanese themselves, where it is just regular green tea powder, and claiming it is matcha. :(<br /><br />UPDATE: I will post a picture of a comparison of this powder and another. I bought Matcha that is from (or claims to be) from Japan and is called "drinking grade". This is a brighter, healthy looking green as opposed to this Taiwanese green tea. Or, the Taiwanese tea is made from different leaves, and not the ones that Matcha is traditionally made out of. Or, the other Matcha is simply a higher grade. Not that high though, as I am aware top notch Matcha is a very very bright green.<br /><br />However, this Taiwanese green tea is great. It keeps me up and 1 teaspoon is enough, or even half. I tried 2 teaspoons (morning and lunch) and I was up all night, so this stuff is real haha. I'd drink just 1 teaspoon for the morning or a 1/2 teaspoon in the morning and another 1/2 during lunch (I personally don't have time for that). Not disregarding the product at all, I love it. But those who want the bright colored Matcha might think differently of this product.<br /><br />This stuff is great for people who do not get enough sleep as well. Put this in some orange juice and that will be your energy drink for the day, and it lasts a very long time.<br /><br />Oh and I paid 45 dollars for 150g of the other Matcha. I plan to use that one only on exam days or something. Or even during an all-nighter.

review/summary: False Advertisement
review/text: I bought this in an Asian market for half this price listed, but I wound up throwing it away after not being able to stomach the stuff. I've tried a few different types of matcha powder and unfortunately resorted to this as a substitute for my daily tea until my next shipment came in from Japan. It's downright awful. That picture on the bag is what a higher quality tea looks like, the actual product turns out to be a muddy looking green. After my bad experience trying to use it in hot tea, I tried putting this in smoothies, baking with it, using it in icecream, nothing would take away the bitterness. I kept adding less and less matcha powder to my recipes, but the bitter taste was there if there was any hint of green tea flavor.<br /><br />Just save your money and buy some real matcha powder. Don't convince yourself that you're enjoying it just because you so desperately want to enjoy matcha green tea. It isn't your fault if you've tried this and don't like it. If someone gave this to me for free, I would politely refuse it. No way I'd re-gift something so terrible unless I hated the person!

Second was with non-dairy milk and honey. Much better. It does have a bitterness and the actual matcha taste is very faint. I'd recommend adding some non-dairy milk and honey with it to enhance the flavor. I'd have to say I do like this tea, but I have tried better. Great in quantity, but not the best quality.

By far the matcha I bought from Teavana. drinking both products side by side the differences are great.<br /><br />this brand does dissolve easier, but the taste is difficult to palate.<br />The other brand I bought is brighter, creamier, and lighter.<br />I will post pictures of both brands.

review/text: for those of you have eaten Bulgogi, this is the best sauce that I have found that you can buy to fix Bulgogi at home and get the same taste as if you were ordering this from the restaurant.  There are a number of ways that you can fix Bulgogi, but for the best taste, use thin sliced top sirloin steak, and just use enough sauce to cover the meat for approximately 30 minutes while marinating it.  Then cook the meat on a grill, as this is the method that is used in the restaurant and will give it a better taste.  One way that my grandchildren like this prepared is if you cut up the meat into small pieces and cook it on the stove top, using all of the sauce so that they will have sauce for their rice.

The sauce is also really flavorful. At first it smelled salty, but when cooked, you get a good balance of salty and sweetness to it. I also love that it has real marinade ingredients such as garlic (which you can see) in it so it has a more of a homemade sauce feel instead of a marinade that is full of preservatives. I also love that it has no MSG.

review/text: The case arrived with the pieces mostly broken and the confectioner's sugar "dusting" all moist, gummy and barely coating the cookies (most of the coating had fallen off). They looked gross, so they ended up NOT being served to guests as a light dessert. Some tasted stale even though they were (barely) in date. The lemon flavor is quite unnatural and the pieces of hard lemon candy baked into these "shortbreads" contributed to this very unnatural flavor. Not a plesant experience and I actually ended up tossing them after tasting the first few boxes. The fact that the shortbreads were broken--very few were whole cookies--added to the disappointment of this purchase. I can't recommend them for these reasons and won't purchase again.

review/text: Love this product.  How can these be 1 pt on weight watchers for 3-4 cookies?  My plain shortbread list the following ingredients- wheat flour, butter, sugar, salt. I read the review claiming for this to have all sorts of additives.  What kind were they eating?  Is it flavored?
