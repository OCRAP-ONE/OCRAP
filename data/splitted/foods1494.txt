review/summary: Wonderful but very strong coconut flavor
review/text: VERY nice coconut oil.  I've been using it exclusively in my cooking lately b/c I wanted to see how it performed for everything from baking to using in savory recipes.  It definitely lends a coconut flavor to all foods.  If you love coconut, that might be acceptable.  I love coconut but coconut flavored biscuits and coconut flavored sausage gravy is a bit off-putting.  Just to give you some warning.  I'm going to hunt for some more mild-tasting oil to use in my savory dishes.

review/summary: Excellent for hair!
review/text: I use this oil as a sealant for my hair, and I love it!  Not only does it soften the hair, but it really seeps into the strands, so it doesn't have a greasy, heavy feeling.<br /><br />The scent is very pleasant--not overpowering at all, and smells like REAL coconut, unlike the overly sweetened smell of hair products at most stores (obviously because it's the real, edible kind).<br /><br />I absolutely love this product.  I have very curly African-American hair (no chemicals), and I was searching for something all-natural to add to my hair care regimen.  After some careful research, I decided to try this.<br /><br />I would recommend extra virgin coconut oil to anyone who may have dry hair, or is looking for something 100% natural to use for their hair.<br /><br />:)

review/text: I love this coconut oil. I've seen many reviews on this product with customers who raved over this product. And I must admitted this is a great product. Mostly used on my hair as a deep conditoner, moisturizer, for shine and health of the hair. It's light enough to use everyday. Used as deep conditioner for hot oil treatment. Nourish and condition the scalp and hair without build up. Best Coconut oil ever used. Will fouth time purchasing this product....5 stars!

review/summary: I am Coconut Cookied Daily!
review/text: So I got this because I go through an UNBELIEVABLE amount of beauty products...lotion being one...and I had yet to find one that left me feeling moisturized from shower to shower without feeling overly greasy, overtly fragranced, etc... so a friend recommended Coconut oil... and since I haven't quite yet used it for cooking (it came with two tubs)...I can only state that it smells like coconut cookies initially and then once rubbed in and after a few minutes it's a barely there scent but solid at room temp and melts when rubbed into your hands so needless to say I love it.

review/summary: Great product with many uses
review/text: I had heard about the benefits of coconut oil from a friend (who swears by coconut water, which is quite possible the nastiest drink ever made). I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I first used it in my hair. I am an African-American female, with natural hair, and I use the coconut oil to seal in the moisture in my hair after I condition my hair in the mornings. It gave my hair a beautiful sheen, and kept it soft throughout the day, so I definitely love its hair benefits.<br /><br />Then I also used it on a patch of really dry skin that I have, right on my leg. I suffer with eczema, and it tends to get worse over the dry winter months. I've been rubbing it in every morning after my shower, and I can see a significant improvement. So two thumbs up for the skin benefits as well.<br /><br />As far as cooking goes, I'm considering using it to sautee some fish and make this coconut-lime tilapia dish I saw a recipe for. If anyone has any other suggestions for how to use it in my cooking, I would love to know. Can it be used in place of any oil? I know different oils have different heat capacities, and didn't know if you could fry with this type of oil.<br /><br />Thanks!!

review/summary: Many Uses!
review/text: The main reason I purchased this oil was to use as a conditioning treatment and daily oil for my hair. And for that it was great--soft, moisturized hair that wasn't weighed down. I then began to mix it with some cheap lotion and glycerin and voila! I now have the most moisturized skin. My feet, which generally take a beating since I wear flip flops a lot, look the best the have in years (even though I'm only 21 lol). The cracks in my heels have disappeared after applying nightly (not consistent) and wearing cotton socks.<br /><br />Using tips from other customers, I also put a little of the oil in my unflavored oatmeal. It was delicious! This way I am able to get a lot of flavor without having a lot of sugar like the pre-flavored packets. I can say that this oil is great and I will definitely repurchase. The two bottles came bound together in plastic so that they would not spill on anything. Also, having two bottles allows for cosmetic use for one and food use for the other. And you can't beat the price for the product's quality and numerous uses.

review/summary: Good product, nice size
review/text: I used to order this in the larger containers from another vendor, but I found that I had a hard time keeping it clean (contamination from scooping it out so much).  And, I was just too lazy to repackage it into smaller containers, so I started buying the two 15 ounce containers.<br /><br />I order this every month or so, and place one in my bathroom (hair, skin, etc) and one in my kitchen (cooking).  Works out wonderfully, although I think castor oil is more hydrating.  I've only used a few other types of coconut oil, but I find this one pleasing in taste (no weird or artificial taste) and consistency (not lumpy or grainy). It is also the most affordable one I've found.<br /><br />I use it to make popcorn (yummy) frequently, and eat a scoop or two each week unheated.  I just let it melt in my mouth.  I know about the risks of using plastic for storage, but at some point, a person has the draw the line.  My line has been drawn, and I've decided that coconut oil in plastic containers is A-OK by me.  If you have major concerns, I suppose that you could transfer it into a glass jar.  I scoop it out with a plastic utensil - something just tells me dipping metal in the jar is counter-productive, but I could be wrong.<br /><br />This oil is well-regarded in general, I believe, by many.

review/summary: Great Product in Great Packaging
review/text: We have been using Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil for several years now and the results we have experienced are excellent. Taking 2 tablespoons of oil daily greatly helped in raising low body temperature, enabling a sluggish metabolism to be stabilized and facilitating weight loss. We have also used it topically on acne with great success - both in healing the blemishes and removing the scars. It is not a panacea, but in combination with healthy diet and exercise it is a wonderful supplement.<br />  Before we had been buying this in the 54 oz jars, but these 15 oz tubs are so much more convenient to use and for travel -- and the price was lower! Unbeatable combination!<br />  The first shipment was damaged in transit, but one phone call to Amazon resolved the problem and they sent out the replacement shipment express at no charge.

review/summary: Excellent Oil for Cooking
review/text: Coconut oil is one of my favorite oils for cooking.  This particular brand has a mild flavor, at least compared to other brands I've tried, and is very reasonably priced.  It is also very stable (keeps well) and is cold pressed virgin.  I used to get this at Wild Oats in Denver, CO to use for stir fries and sautees.  It makes an INCREDIBLE Thai style curry -- you use this oil to fry the spices and vegetables, then simmer everything in coconut milk.  You get several layers of coconut flavor this way.  Plus, this is one of the best oils you can consume *period*.  It is so rich in HDL and other good fats it'll scrub your arteries clean in a month.  The coconut is a magical thing...there's a reason that coconut water can be used in an IV in place of saline for dehydration-- it's meant to be in your blood!

review/summary: So moisturizing it made my skin RUB OFF!
review/text: This stuff is incredible. I had been using almond oil, jojoba oil, all different kinds of body lotions, and castor/olive oil. NONE came close to being as brilliant as coconut oil!<br /><br />About me:<br /><br />*I am 20 yrs old, white/half-russian. My skin is acne-prone and a BIT on the dry-side. My skin doesn't tan or burn easily, and I am obsessed with anti-aging (I want to write a book on what worked and what didn't when I am older :D). I live in California, so the weather is rather neutral year-round.<br /><br />*What coconut oil has done for me:<br /><br />Coconut oil smells sooo nice and has a great texture -- depending on the weather it is either creamy and solid or silky and liquid. Being as affordable as it is, I can smear this all-over my body after showers and it will absorb within 30 minutes to an hour. My skin feels sooo soft and hydrated afterwards and it even helps my sunless tanners last longer! This stuff made my skin so soft that one day I wore cotton shorts from Hollister (so you can imagine, slightly baggy). It was a hot day, and after walking around outside for only around 45 minutes my upper thighs/bikini line were KILLING ME. When I went home I noticed the first layer of skin had rubbed off because it was SO soft!!! This was a bit annoying, so I cut-down on the amount of coconut oil I use...but that was like *Wow*<br />Also, my boyfriend constantly tells me how soft my skin is when I am using it *waiting for three more to arrive tomorrow!*<br /><br />Coconut oil is the best moisturizer EVER! I absolutely love this stuff and will continue using it forever! I still use castor oil every few weeks just for the healing properties (I think) and for my eyes/teeth/gums, but this stuff is sooo nice for my skin (and hair in small portions)!<br /><br />If you want a moisturizer that FINALLY gives the results you want, THIS IS IT!!! Five stars! :D

review/summary: Simply the best
review/text: I've tried coconut oil before, but it was usually refined and unscented. In other words, horrible! Nutiva is great! It smells like fresh coconuts and has a very subtle coconut flavor. I use it to cook and as a body moisturizer. I don't do much deep frying, but I've sauteed shrimp and pan fried fish in this oil. Both turned out wonderfully with a slight coconut flavor which just made it all better for me. I have to agree with everyone that the plastic container is a let down, but I bought some small mason jars and put my oil in them. Works perfectly. That way I have a jar for the kitchen and one for the bath. Definitely try Nutiva if you're even a little curious about coconut oil. You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Gives new meaning to:  eat it or wear it!
review/text: While I ordered the Coconut Oil to cook with, I have found that it is absolutely incredible for other uses!  I suffer from psoriasis, and have been known to try anything to relieve it....well, you guessed it, the Coconut Oil was my next victim, and wow was I thrilled with the results.  It was soothing, moisturizing, and as a bonus, wonderfully aromatic.  After a couple weeks of continued use on my elbows, the results were really impressive.<br /><br />In addition to that, I have used it on my face, feet and hands as an overnight moisturizer, and it's doing wonders to my skin.  I also put some in a tiny tub to put on underneath lipstick (which can be so drying!).<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most obviously, it is delicious and healthy for cooking.  The only caveat I'll put here is that you definitely have to know ahead of time that the coconut smell is there.  There are some meals I just don't want to smell like coconut, so those I use my good old canola oil on.  But for chicken, with a little soy sauce, it is downright tropical, and I love it!  Very very pleased with this purchase, and delighted with Amazon's pricing on it as well.

review/summary: Great for baking!
review/text: This coconut oil (unrefined) is GREAT for baking.  Everyone loves my gluten-free, dairy-free brownies.  The oil is hard when refridgerated (cold brownies), but liquifies above 78 degrees F., so it literally melts in your mouth.  It also gives brownies a great extra sweetness.  You can use it in place of butter or lard in most baking recipes.  I also use it in the pancake pan and egg pan and to grease pans before baking.  This two-bottle version is actually less expensive per oz. than the large bottle version using the subsribe and save option.

review/text: Read so many reviews about this product that I just had to try it.  So far, I have used it in place of oil and butter, on toast, mixed in oatmeal, and on pancakes/waffles.  I sneak it into anything I can for my kids. It is great on my face, not greasy like I expected, it absorbs and really makes my skin glow.  I put it on my daughter's forehead where she was beginning to get little bumps, and they were gone in 2 days.  Let's see, what else?  I am happy to find a natural product that has so many uses.  I wish I had know about this last year when I had to go through Chemotherapy for breast cancer.  I have read all kinds of studies where coconut oil has been used to help patients after chemo.  I had terrible memory loss and "chemo fog".  Will definitely re-order, and send some to my Dad who has always worried about the possibility of getting Alzheimers.  (Google has great information about this.)  Hope this helps!

review/summary: So Many Uses
review/text: I buy a half gallon of this every 6 months or so.  I don't worry about it spoiling because it has a much longer shelf life than other oils and a very high heat tolerance.  I use it for cooking mostly.  It is great on popcorn with sea salt, freshly baked bread, in stir frys and you can often use it in place of butter in many dishes.  I have a fabulous raw chocolate recipe that I make with it and give out as gifts.  After reading The Coconut Oil Miracle book by Bruce Fife I try to use coconut oil as much as I can.  It is anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal.  Truly a miracle food that is so healthy for you.<br /><br />I also use it on my hair when it needs a deep conditioning treatment.  Just leave it in overnight and wash out the next day and my hair is so shiny and soft afterwards and even feels a bit thicker.  It is great for your skin, especially if you feel like you are getting sick.  Just slather it on and let its amazing healing properties absorb into your blood stream via your skin.  I use it in smoothies to help my immune system as well.  And if I feel like I am coming down with something I will mix it with orange juice like is recommended in the Coconut Oil Miracle book.<br /><br />I also oil pull with it.  If you haven't read about oil pulling with coconut oil, you should.  It is a great teeth whitener among many other things including healing mouth sores.<br /><br />I really like the Nutiva brand because it tastes fresher than most. Very clean coconut flavor. I like that it is organic and doesn't have any thing funky in it nor is it processed unhealthily like so many other brands.

review/summary: Amazing product!
review/text: I've been using this product for a week now and I cannot believe the difference in my skin. I have seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp, ears and near my eyebrows and I have put the coconut oil on and left it on overnight (using a towel on my pillow because it is greasy) and the difference is amazing! I was given an Rx from my dermatologist (Luxiq Mouse - which is a steroid), but I don't like the idea of putting that on daily, as it thins out your skin.<br />I've tried lotions (cetaphil, eucerine, etc.) but I have never had an improvement like this.<br /><br />In addition to the seborrheic dermatitis, I have very dry skin. At the end of the day, if I'm wearing a dark-colored shirt, upon removal, the shirt is lined with skin flakes (gross, I know). But, since using this coconut oil, the flakes are GONE! It's truly unbelievable! Prior to receiving the coconut oil, I was washing with Cerave and using their lotion as well. While I noticed my skin didn't feel as "tight", I still had flakes. It wasn't until I mixed the coconut oil with the Cerave that the flakes disappeared.<br /><br />I also take 1 tbsp of coconut oil daily, with my breakfast. The flavor is amazing!<br /><br />I would 100% recommend this to anyone with dry skin or seborrheic dermatitis!

review/summary: Great taste, Best Buy!
review/text: I have tried three different brands of coconut oil: Barlean's, Nutiva, and Tropical Traditions. The VIRGIN coconut oil has a nice, light coconut flavor.  The EXPELLER pressed coconut oil has no flavor. So, if you a buying virgin coconut oil here's my tip: Barlean's had the best flavor and smell...I wanted to eat it right out of the jar it smelled so good, tasted phenomenal!! Barlean's was the most expensive of the three but for the flavor worth it. Nutiva was a close second in taste & smell and is more economical. Tropical Traditional (which I have always loved their products in the past) did not measure up in flavor. In fact it had a strange, burnt taste and smell...something was off about it. If you want no coconut flavor at all, get the expeller pressed coconut oil. It is less expensive than virgin coconut oil...all three companies use proper, healthy, non-chemical practices to extract the oil, so I would go with the best buy for the expeller cold pressed oil but pay a little more for the flavored version.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VLZ8D0">Barlean's Organic Oils Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16-Ounce Jar</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VVVJ6W">32-oz glass - Gold Label Organic Virgin Coconut Oil - 1 quart</a>

review/text: Just started using coconut oil at home a few weeks ago. I started with a brand I purchased a local Hy-Vee because I wanted to try it out before I bought a more substantial amount. THe first buy was a refined coconut oil made by Spectrum. It worked well for what I used it for - nightly oil cleansing on my face, moisturizer and as an addition to my weekly deep conditioner for my hair...occasionally I'd spread some on toast. It worked out well, so i purchased ther Nutiva and was expecting a much better product than the Spectrum....it arrived yesterday and I was not disappointed. As soon as I opened it I could smell it - it smells and tastes AMAZING - just like fresh coconut. If you're not a fan of coconut, remember that this is not the smell/taste of sweetened, dried coconut or coconut fragrance...it smalls like actual coconut. I did my first oil cleanse with it last night and it seems slightly gritty at times, but nothing that is concerning to me. This is definitely a staple from now on!!

review/summary: Nutiva cocnut oil
review/text: I've tried many different brands of coconut oil. So far, Nutiva beats all the other ones. I use it as an oil/shortening substitute for everything from frying to baking. It is also great to simply spread on toasted bagels or bread. If I'm not using in foods, then I'll eat a couple tablespoons daily as suggested by my doctor, the health/nutritional benefits are finally and increasingly being recognized and praised. You won't regret trying this product, and you'll be hooked on it!

review/summary: Great Stuff for a Number of Things
review/text: I was almost put off using coconut oil entirely, after purchasing another brand (I think NOW was it, but different packaging). It came hard as a rock, yellow-looking and smelled pretty foul (almost sickly-sweet) - certainly nothing like coconut. I literally was chipping it out of the jar, and melting it was near impossible. Eventually, I realized that I was dealing with rancid oil, so it's pretty fortunate that I didn't use it all that often. Yuck.<br /><br />After watching a view Youtube videos for hair care, I noticed everyone's was white, creamy and you could easily scoop it out of the jar, so I decided to give it another shot and purchased Nutiva in February 2011. I'm so glad I did, too, because this stuff is great and for a number of things, some of which caught me off guard.<br /><br />- Cooking -<br />I enjoy cooking with it now and then, especially with my quick-fix quesadillas when I don't have time to cook anything else. However, it doesn't work on everything due to the subtle yet nutty flavor it can give, but I do like it for frying. Your place will smell like coconut when you fry with it, as a warning. I do love how fast it heats up, though.<br /><br />- Hair -<br />I originally intended to use this for hair and as a deep conditioning mask. I am biracial, with 3A/3b and a tinge of 3C hair. While I usually prefer to have it relaxed, I decided to give it a break due to lack of funds. The hard water we have here has been wreaking havoc on my hair and it's been in need of a trim for a while, but this stuff has greatly improved things, and it even can be used (lightly) to help tame frizz to some degree as a leave-in. My ringlets are back and the best-looking they've been since I can remember, and all I've been using since then is just Aphogee Green Tea spray, coconut oil and occasional argan oil.<br /><br />- Skin -<br />I consistently use this on my body and at night as skin cream. For the face, you only need a tiny, tiny amount. It also helps to tame down blemishes, which is a bonus, and leaves skin glowy. Last year or the year before, I also developed what looked like flesh-colored moles, which I thought were blemishes at first, but I can't be certain. Nothing I did would get rid of them though, until I started using the oil, which I found odd, but at least it worked! All in all, my skin has dramatically improved using this, with the help of some other products, and I don't feel I have to wear foundation.<br /><br />- Pets -<br />I give 1/2 tbls. to my cats and 1 tbls. to my dog a few times a week to help maintain their coats and keep their skin nice. It seems to be doing great and they've stopped driving me mental with scratching. I also tried it in hopes of helping my dog with her seizures. While it's not a drastic improvement, they have been fewer in between, which may or may not have a connection. I just mix it in their food maybe 2-3 days a week (ask your vet about how often, especially if they have health problems), and they love it. Even my female cat, who's picky about what she'll eat licks at the oil before she munches away.<br /><br />- Warts -<br />Short of the suspicious-looking things on my face at one point, I don't get moles, warts, or even freckles. However, I did get one whopping wart on the top of my big toe last year, which nothing would get rid of. I tried apple cider vinegar, wart patches and gels - you name it; I tried it. Not only did it hurt like crazy and work slowly, but it never got rid of it. All I did get was a scar and a lot of grief, only for it to return a few weeks later.<br /><br />When I started using coconut oil on the skin, I realized one day, like with my face, that my wart that had grown back was getting smaller. I kept watching it and finally realized the connection. I started using bandaids and applied a glob of oil on the spot before bed and then really started noticing results. This wart was the size of a chick pea (sorry to be gross lol), but now you can't see anything.<br /><br />I finally looked things up and realized that it was the acid in the oil that attacks lipid-coated virus cells, such as what's associated with HPV (warts), so I guess it makes sense. I was surprised though! I can tell due to the texture of the skin that it's not 100% gone (roots), but it still getting better and I'm not embarrassed anymore. It took about a month, but the more painful options took just as long and this is pain-free. So, it's something to try!<br /><br />Love this stuff and can't stop raving about it. I'm going to purchase more soon in this size to keep one in my kitchen and one in my bathroom again, plus a larger one for the mutts. The bathroom one still has plenty in it, despite me using it near-daily.

review/text: I have had coconut oil before but none that compares to this.  It is sooooo good!  It looks good, smells good, and tastes good.  It is well worth the price.  It is very smooth and has a slightly sweet taste.  I use it in place of butter and shortening.  It is really good on toasted bread. I suppose it would be a really good skin moisturizer also.

review/summary: Heart healthy and tasty
review/text: I'd seen many suggestions for coconut products, including coconut oil, on the healthy living blogs I subscribe to, so I figured I'd see what the buzz was all about.  We searched at the local natural foods stores and weren't able to find it, so I turned to Amazon.  I swapped it in for the canola oil in a boxed brownie mix - delicious!  It had a slight coconut flavor (likely because of the amount it calls for), and the oil stays solid at room temperature, thus minimizing spillage.  Next, I'll be testing it with savory foods to see if the coconut flavor comes through in eggs/veggies/etc.  But for baked goods, I'd totally suggest the swap.<br /><br />(Oh yeah, and this product was eligible for Prime, so I had it within 3 days...nothing beats that!)

review/summary: Pure and Versatile
review/text: This is the best coconut oil around!<br />--"Extra virgin" means it actually smells of coconut and is far less processed than the refined coconut oil that is next to it on the shelf.<br />--It's a solid when left at room temperature but takes seconds to melt down in a pan and measure accurately into measuring spoons and cups if you're put off by its solid state. It should also be melted down before going into baked goods to be most effective, unless mixing it into something heated.<br />--I use this coconut oil to toast pecans for my morning steel-cut oats as well as substituting all oils and butter for most of my baked goods!<br />--It adds a subtle sweetness when replacing butter and any other oil.<br />--If ever I happen to get this oil on my fingers, I simply rub it in as a moisturizer since it smells heavenly and trumps any other moisturizer I've used.<br />--The wonderful thing about this oil is that, while high in saturated fat, it is broken down differently in the body and thus is not the bad sort of saturated fat you might normally be weary of (This is as I understand from my own personal research and there is still some debate on the topic).<br />--So while you shouldn't go overboard and use this by the barral because it's healthier than butter, you can feel better about using it as a substitution.<br />--I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WV153I">Artisana Organic Raw Coconut Butter 16oz</a> also if you like Nutiva's extra virgin coconut oil that can be added to steel-cut oats and any other food you can sneak it into if you're like me and need to force fat into your diet because you're an active vegetarian lacking consistent  source of fat and don't want to have to plan it into meals each day

I have tried several brands, and the Nutiva brand is my favorite for flavor, cost and effectivness.  I love it!  I would recommend this product for everyone, as it offers benefits for every type of problem, and for improvements in energy levels, weight loss, better skin and hair, fighting infections....the list is endless. Bravo Nutiva for offering a product that is reasonably priced of the highest quality, and bravo Amazon for offering this superior product at such a good price point.

review/summary: I love this stuff!
review/text: I have been having problems with my skin. The moisturizer I was using felt kind of scummy on my face after I added my foundation and I was having troubles with facial redness and dry patches. I was also having heat rash problems in my underarm area. I started using just a little of the coconut oil on my face in place of my moisturizer, then applying my foundation and wow! What a difference! My skin has cleared up and I love the soft smooth way my face feels. My foundation spreads and blends much better.  Also, the coconut oil really helps with the heat rash, immediately soothing the discomfort. I like using this as a hand cream too. I look forward to seeing how well it works this winter when the air is much drier.<br /><br />I have done a little cooking with it, but not enough yet to have an opinion.<br /><br />Other folks have mentioned that the oil leaked during shipment. I was concerned about this since I ordered it during the summer. I ordered 4 tubs (2 pks of 2 tubs). The plastic containers arrived packed in plastic bags, 2 tubs/bag, within the box. Even though the lids felt pretty tight on the tubs, both of the plastic bags had some coconut oil that had leaked, but not enough to feel cheated. A little oil leaked out of the plastic bags into the box, but they were the only things packed in the box so nothing was ruined. I can see that if the lids had been any looser though, there would have been a mess. Oil is hard to keep in a container with a wide mouth like this.<br /><br />One more thing...I absolutely love the smell of this stuff. It has a light roasted coconut essence which isn't too strong and doesn't linger overly long, but long enough to enjoy for a short while while it is being absorbed by the skin. Yum!

Texans are very particular about their salsa, so I was skeptical about using a packaged seasoning. I changed my mind when she let me taste what she had made. We did add extra jalape&ntilde;o and garlic, but, in this part of Texas, that goes without saying.  The resulting salsa is delicious. No wonder this product is always sold out around here! I ordered mine online, so now I don't have to go looking for it.

review/summary: Adams Flea and Tick Dip
review/text: This is not the same Adams Flea and Tick Dip of days gone by.  The old formula was quite effective and got rid of ticks after 2 dippings on my dog Maggie.  My grandson's dog King is plagued with ticks because of the surrounding area that we live in. He's taken for walks along the street with woods and a lake and gets re-infested quite quickly.  It has helped, but is not 100% effective. Now he scratches all the time and I have ordered some Stop Itch shampoo and conditioner to see if this helps. We even tried AdvanTix that did not help get rid of the ticks either. We shall go back to the Preventic collar. Maybe a bubble suit or space suit would be the solution.  "White American Eskimo Dog in a Bubble/space suit walks the outer perimeter of Miami Florida along the lake and woods to keep out ticks".  We use Advantage for fleas and he is flea free 100%.

review/text: Loved the idea of a healthy snack so gave these a try. Tasty treat but WAY too much salt. They are soooo salty they gave me a headache!  If you are watching your sodium intake, skip these little crackers.  It's too bad, too, because otherwise they were a nice snack.  Not going to purchase again.

review/summary: If you have to eat junk food, at least eat organic junk food!
review/text: Since watching the movie Food, Inc., I have been taking even more care not to buy anything with HFCS or partially hydrogenated oil in it. When it comes to snack foods, that's really difficult. Graham crackers, soda crackers, and many bagged crunchy snacks have one or the other in the list of ingredients, not to mention that the ingredient list includes a lot of unrecognizable ingredients! I'd be okay not buying junk food, but my kids would revolt if we had NOTHING. So I bought some of these Late July mini crackers, both cheese and peanut butter. The kids gobbled them down in no time, and I have to admit, I ate a handful too. They're pretty pricey, but buying them in bulk definitely helps. Feeding them these crackers makes me feel a little bit better about allowing them to eat food that, let's face it, has little nutritional value.

Amazon was out of the full sized Late July Organic Cheddar Cheese Sandwich crackers (which I liked) so I thought I would give these a try.  Most were broken and those that weren't were soooo "mini".

review/summary: Tiny Treats for Little Dogs
review/text: I bought a box of these treats for my two picky little dogs with itchie paws (10lb each) from Costco several months ago.  I've now emptied the box - well the dogs emptied the box - and I went back to Costco for another go around.  Whoops - it was a one time thing for Costco.... darn! So off to the specialty puppy store for grain free/gluten free dog treats.  Tiny little bags of treats for $6 a bag! Sooo got home and checked the Amazon website .... Hello .... Here are the treats from Costco!  Wish I had found them before now!<br /><br />My dogs are kinda picky.  I feed them Fromm grain free foods which they eat well - but the Fromm treats are really expensive and kinda large.  These are nice and small for small dogs ... about 1.5 inches by .5 inches.  They look kinda plasticky rather than "home baked" but that didn't seem to bother my dogs - they still woofed them down.  As for flavor ... well I didn't eat them but my dogs both seemed to like them.<br /><br />The box I got at Costco lasted me about 4 1/2 months with three heavy treaters for the two dogs.  There are a LOT of treats in this box and they held well in a ziplock bag.

review/summary: Rusty loves them
review/text: My dog, a 65 lb Aussie Dingo mix isn't finicky, but he seems to especially love these biscuits. I love that they're grain free with generally wholesome ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients are not on the Amazon site nor on the company web site so as a service to fellow Amazon shoppers: the ingredients are Peas, Ground Peas, Turkey Meal, Potatoes, Pea Protein, Pumpkin, Chicken Fat, Blueberries, Cranberries, Pea Fiber, Ground Tapioca, Flax Seed, and Lecithin. While not perfect, Turkey Meat, for example, would be better quality than "Turkey Meal", and Sweet Potatoes would be better than "Potatoes" these are generally excellent and non-allergenic ingredients.<br /><br />I use these in my treat bag, about 7 or 8 a day and Rusty works very hard for them, which makes for a happy dog and owner. Healthwise, we feel comfortable giving him a few of these a day these instead of quality kibbles.

review/summary: tasty snack!
review/text: Korean seaweed snacks are very tasty. My local Chinese supermarket sells this brand, in addition to another favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JPV4AO">ChoripDong Korean Seaweed Snack (Kim Nori), Roasted w/Olive oil & Sea Salted, 0.17-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>. If you've tried Japanese seaweed snacks and didn't like them, you may like Korean ones. Korean seaweed snacks are typically roasted and flavored with salt and oil while Japanese ones are oil-less. This makes Korean seaweed sheets very light, flaky, and crispy. They just crumble in your mouth. Both are very nutritious and healthy, but Japanese seaweed strips are thicker and more chewy. The downside to the yumminess is that Korean seaweed snacks typically taste saltier, so it's best to eat them with a bowl of rice, though I've gone through several packs of them on their own. You also have to wipe your fingers afterward because of the oil.<br /><br />Inside each pouch is a plastic tray that holds 6 or 8 sheets of pre-cut seaweed to prevent crush damage. If you don't like seaweed at all, you might not like this. Seaweed snacks are not for everyone. But if you do, definitely give this a try.

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: I'm rating this product based on flavor. It has a somewhat subtle sweetness that doesn't make my face scrunch up if I eat it by the spoonful. When I first tried it I noted a slightly floral pungency, but I could no longer detect it after continued use. It is absolutely perfect for tea and one of the better honeys that I've used in my tea.<br /><br />It's a beautiful golden color that seems to swirl or glitter in the light unlike any honey I've seen before.<br /><br />This is definitely worth trying. The aroma alone is notably enjoyable.<br /><br />After trying several other honeys from New Zealand, I've decided that I prefer the flavor of this one in particular.<br /><br />This jar is made of #1 PETE plastic and is BPA free. The lid is made of polypropylene, so you won't have to worry about BPA or PVC in plastisol food liners touching your honey. There is no seal, and that's the major downfall of the packaging. I like when there's a seal even if the lid is considered relatively safe -- it makes me feel better about having the honey shipped during hot weather when certain plastics are more likely to leech into food. I'm not going to take a star away because of packaging, but if I could give it a separate vote the packaging would get a three or four star -- mostly for not having a seal.<br /><br />Other organic honey with BPA and PVC free packaging:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK08OC">Certified Organic Manuka</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y3ZECM">Really Raw Honey, 1 X 16 Oz</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OMJWXU">Wee Bee Naturally Raw Honey -- 1 lb Each</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H89EWK">Himalaya Herbal Healthcare - Soliga Forest Organic Honey, 8.8 oz gel</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006GV6O34">Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Raw Honey, 16oz</a>

review/summary: Was hoping for a little more heat, but love the flavor
review/text: I've been hooked on pepper spreads for a long time and especially since I was in Italy and brought home a few. I love the distinct Italian pepper flavors which are different than Mexican and Asian peppers. This spread is actually pretty mild but it does have a great, unique pepper spread flavor. it's also a lot of diced stuff, and reminds me of the texture of an olive tapenade. It is not super oily. there is oil that collects around the top when you first open it, but overall it's a pretty 'dry' spread as opposed to something that is soaked in olive oil and drips everywhere. That makes this very suitable for putting on crackers. It also works great for bread of course, though I'd want it more oily for breads. No problem though, just have some olive oil handy.<br /><br />Because of the cost, I would not bother using this a part of a sauce. It's best as a spread or maybe used as topping for stuffed peppers or pizza. All in all it is very high quality and an excellent appertiva/tapas addition.

review/text: I love finding food items that add a lot of flavor without adding a lot of calories. At just 20 calories per tablespoon, this spread is amazing. Yes there are plenty of low-calorie spreads out there, but who would want to eat them? One tablespoon on a sandwich gives it a fiery bright flavor that makes the sandwich special. On a piece of fresh Italian bread, you have a gourmet treat. Yes, it is very spicy, so stay away if you don't love a little "burn" on the the tongue. But for those who seek out intense flavorful experiences, give this a try.

review/summary: Good for training, but what about the calories?
review/text: I bought these as a healthy, affordable training treat for my dog. I also hoped my dog would like them a little more than the traing treats he had been eating, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZH552">Premier Liver Biscotti Dog Treats, 6-1/2-Ounce Wheat/ Egg Free Bow Wow Bites</a>. My dog liked the biscotti, but I thought he might be getting tired of them. My dog likes these Becca's treats, but not more than the biscotti. I get the same response from my dog whichever I use.<br />The ingredients are wholesome, but the calory information is not available, even on the company website. I struggle to keep my dog within his healthy weight range, so not knowing the calories is troublesome. The biscotti treats are 1 to 2 calories each. Each biscotti treat is smaller and less dense than each Becca's treat, so Becca's must be more caloric. I just wish I knew how much more caloric.<br />One slight advantage to the biscotti for me is that they are very hard and can be carried in one's hip pocket on a walk without crumbling. Becca's bits are softer and need to be carried in a loose pocket. Their softer texture may be an advantage for small dogs or dogs who have trouble chewing.<br />I personally won't buy these again and plan to give some bags as doggie gifts, but some dogs may really like the taste and respond best to these for training. I'd say to try them, especially if you are searching for a good traing treat for your dog.

review/text: The grandchildren really like them and so do the adults.  The bars are great snacks and healthy. They have a touch of sweetness and you can't go wrong with pecans. They make a good after school snack with a glass of milk.

review/summary: Better then the plain Nature Valley Bars
review/text: My favorite Nature Valley bar flavor is peanutbutter. I saw the pecan and decided to try them. These are my second favorite flavor! They arrived fresh, crunchy and well packaged. If you like granola bars and pecans, you will LOVE these.

review/summary: Granola Bars - Nature Valley Pecan Crunch - My Favorite
review/text: I am a fan of this product.  I may be incorrect, but I find these bars give me the taste satisfaction of eating a cookie with the nutrition and calorie content of a healthy snack. The Granola is reasonably healthy and the calories of 190 calories for 2 bars is very reasonable compared to other granola bars and particularly if compared with 2 cookies of comparable size (mostly sugar and butter). I have tried a number of other healthy snack bars and I like Nature Valley the best. Although I vary which flavors I purchase, Pecan Crunch is my favorite because it has a nutty pecan flavor.

review/summary: I love these granola bars
review/text: They are sometimes hard to find in my local grocery store so I was so glad to be able to get them online.  I cannot eat peanuts that are added to so many granola bars, but I want a tad more protein than bars with no nuts.  So these pecan-filled bars are great.

review/summary: Nature Valley Pecan Crunchy Granola Bars, 12 Ct Boxes ( Pack of 12)
review/text: These granola bars are delicious!  Since I prefer the pecan bar to all the others out there, I wanted a way to purchase them without buying the variety packs. I prefer not having to drive to my local grocery store (Publix) which was the only one in my neighborhood that carried the boxes with only the pecan crunch bars.  Using Amazon to buy the product in bulk is a much more convenient way to purchase this great tasting product in bulk..

review/text: This xanthan gum is not corn derived, like the rest of them seem to be.  Consequently, it IS gold plated to a mom whose children are gluten free, lactose free, soy free, dye free and CORN free.  ;)  I don't care that it is more...things turn out much sturdier and nicer using it and my son doesn't have a reaction to it.

review/text: It's not "gold plated".  It's too expensive for 2 oz.  They want almost $10.00 for shipping to boot!  I bought 6 oz., 3 times that amount for less than what they want for 2 oz from Swanson's,  and they charge $5.00 for shipping total for all you want to buy on your order.

review/summary: Very Flavorful
review/text: I bought these pickled onions along with several other items popular in the UK. I love them. They are pickled in malt vinegar that one uses on fish and chips, which I greatly enjoy. I have used these onions "sparingly" in several applications, including on top of a pizza! They are strongly flavored so I chop them up - a little goes a long way. This is also great since they are expensive, but worth the price. Recommended!

review/text: I picked up the taste for pickled onions when i lived in England.  If they make you squint when placed in your mouth theyre just right.  These were pretty close to perfect for me but I like the London Pub ones better.  I also tried Judy's sour pickled onions but they were too sour for me.

review/summary: Best Onions, by far - But brutally expensive.
review/text: I give these five stars, because there is, really, no substitute when celebrating the Christmas Holidays. Crisp, tart and delicious, these pickled onions are always a staple on our table for Christmas and Boxing Day.  My only complaint is that you really have to be in a "Price is no object" mindset when you order these, because the price is brutal.  If you have to pay shipping also, it becomes even more scary.  As always, I will continue to look for more reasonable suppliers for them.

review/summary: Next best thing to the ones in the pubs!
review/text: I love pickled onions, especially when they are served in a pub with a ploughman's lunch.  Haywards are the closest I've found to the English pub pickled onions.  They are crisp with just the right tartness. I have a jar in the fridge right now.  Luckily I can buy these at the local Publix grocery store here in South Florida for less than half the price of ordering them on line!  I like to serve them with a warm buttered hard roll, a couple of cherry tomatoes and a chunk of good quality cheese.  Branston Pickle goes well with it, too.

review/summary: OK--but not good value or extrodinary taste
review/text: Item arrived after at very end of allotted shipping timeframe.  Product's unremarkable plastic bottles were packed in a twin-pak box that required considerably larger exterior packaging for secure delivery.  These 16.9 oz bottles are even smaller than expected--each of the two is about the size of a premium soft drink bottle.  What was more disappointing was the lackluster taste and flavor impact of the oil itself: although smooth and light, it is nothing special.  Its use imparted no enhancing flavor when used to pop corn in an electric popcorn popper and certainly offered nothing special when used to toss a fresh salad with balsamic vinegar.<br /><br />This BetterBody Foods organic oil may indeed have been processed in an ultra-fabulous unique manner, but I discern no real taste difference from the grocery chain's 48oz bottle of Crisco-brand canola oil (bought on sale locally today for $2.99) with its own light taste, cholesterol-free rating, and trans-fat free purity.  Save your dollars: use more distinctive coconut oil for your corn popping [you likely will have fewer unpopped kernels than was the case with the steeply-priced BetterBody Food's organic canola oil] and buy your cold-processed canola oil in larger containers  having a more favorable price per ounce.
