review/text: I purchased a set of these salts to give as holiday gifts last year.  Everyone who received one of the blends continues to rave about it!  One evening a friend of mine brought over a black bean dip that she made from the recipe on the Artistic Taste website, it was absolutely delicious! After that, I ended up buying a set of the salts for my own kitchen.  Being a vegetarian, I am always looking for creative ways to enhance the flavor of the food I cook - mostly so my meat loving friends will stop complaining :-).  These salts really bring out the flavor of my food!

I get home after a long day and rub the Himalayan Pink Island on some fish and have great flavor on a healthy dish.  When I am being more indulgent, the smokehouse blend is perfect for brisket.  The porcini mushroom makes a great risotto and I save a fortune not having to buy porcini mushrooms.  I highly suggest visiting the Artistic Taste website and checking out the all recipes.  It is my go-to place whenever I am entertaining.  I am sure to make great food with relative ease.  Also, the well designed jars look great in my kitchen.

review/text: When we got my dog, she barely ate. She didn't even like treats. We finally got her to eat, but the regular (more affordable) brands didn't sit well with her system. My vet recommended this or to cook her food on our own. Obviously, cooking food for a dog gets a bit time-consuming, but this Pinnacle food really was great for my dog. She finally started to gain weight. (She was so skinny when we got her from the shelter.)<br /><br />My dog doesn't seem to have the farting problem the other reviewer said.<br /><br />I guess every dog's system is different and you just have to find the one that's right for your dog. this one works great for ours :)

review/summary: My Shiloh loves it!
review/text: My canine companion is a 132 pound, five year old, Shiloh Shepherd.  The Shiloh Shepherd is considered a 'giant breed.'  With his enormous size, athleticism, and the general nutrient demands, we all must consider, his diet has always been a primary consideration.  Not to mention, he has the sensitive tummy often seen among the German Shepherd breed.  His breeder has always been partial to 'Premium Edge Lamb.'  This is the formula he was weaned on.  I had no desire to change what appeared to be a successful regimen.<br /><br />Then to my dismay, I learned 'Premium Edge' was placed on a recent recall list.  I knew that a change in diet was likely to be detrimental to my fur friend, but I had to take immediate action.  And, at the time of recall, I didn't have time to gradually transition to a new diet, which is always the way to go, to avoid negative symptoms.<br /><br />After carefully analyzing formulas of numerous dry kibble, I opted to give Pinnacle (Trout & Sweet Potato) a try, ordering a 15 pound 'starter' bag from Amazon.  In addition, I ordered some digestive enzymes to assist in the transition phase.<br /><br />The bag arrived.  I opened it with my dog assisting to see what his response would be.  The first whiff out of the bag was strong, smelling of fish.  I noted the kibble size, itself, was quite small for a large breed dog, but felt this was only a minor reservation.  The ultimate test was not what I thought about it, but what my Shiloh would.  He immediately had a positive response.  In fact --- he loves it!  He appears more enthusiastic about it than the 'Premium Edge.'<br /><br />I had to start the Pinnacle before the enzymes arrived, so I was expecting some terrible gas and possibly some diarrhea.  Well, that was not the case.  He has gone through the 15 pound bag, and half of the next order --- a 30 pound bag, with no diarrhea, or gas, at all.  In fact, his stools appear firmer and more consistent than on his previous diet.  Supplementing with the enzymes was actually not necessary.<br /><br />I'm delighted with this new regimen.  I also love that I can order a 30 pound bag through Amazon and have it delivered to my front door.  I'm now avoiding a considerable drive,  and,  the back-breaking-discomfort, of lugging around heavy bags of kibble.<br /><br />My dog is happy, and I'm happy.  That said, after an adequate therapeutic trial, I feel confident in recommending Pinnacle.

review/summary: Only thing that will settle in my Bichon's stomach
review/text: I have a Bichon Frise with a horrible stomach for keeping any food down. This was the only dog food we could find that she wouldn't throw up. It was recommended by our vet who said our Bichon just had a lot of allergies and this food was known to work well with dogs having her problems.<br /><br />It's a bunch cheaper on amazon than any local pet store we could find, and we don't have to have the trouble of lugging the 30 lb bag home.<br /><br />However, the reason for the loss of 1 star -- our dog really dislikes the taste of it. She's on a pretty tight diet to lose weight currently and still refuses to eat the food immediately when poured into her bowl. She'll sniff it on and off for about an hour before eating it. It also gives her pretty bad breath, but these are both things I can live with to eliminate the stained carpets.<br /><br />We have been using the food for over 2 years with no problems; I definitely recommend it if your dog has a sensitive stomach.

review/summary: My picky dog enjoys eating it
review/text: My dog, a Great Pyrenees, has a few food allergies (rice, chicken, eggs, soy, nuts) and is picky about the food he eats. I was feeding him Orijen 6-Fish and, after a few months, he decided to stop eating it.  After trying a few different foods I heard about Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.  He loves it and it agrees with his digestive system.  I order it from Amazon because the price is lower than the local pet stores in my area. With Amazon Prime, it arrives in 2 days.<br /><br />Four stars because I do need to mix the last quarter of the food with the next bag (treating it like a new dog food - I didn't need to do that with Orijen 6 Fish).  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Alternate meat source = less itchy dog
review/text: My dog started developing signs of an allergy last year - nothing overt - just noticable skin twitches when I touched her in certain areas on her back.  Unsure if her reactions were due to environment or food, but they didn't seem to be seasonal grass allergies, so I chose to test the easiest source first.  I chose a food with a completely different meat source, switching from chicken to fish.  It's only been a week and I'm already seeing improvement.  She's still showing signs of itchiness, but her reaction is much less when I pet her back.  And on top of that, her fur is softer too!  It's early yet, and there can still be some progress made, but I have no doubt that the change in food is helping.  I sat and read review after review on dog foods with in-depth ingredient analysis before settling on Pinnacle Trout & Sweet Potato.  If after 6 weeks, she still shows some signs of being itchy, I'll happily try the Salmon and Potato Grain Free variety to see if grains are a factor in her allergies as well.<br /><br />Have seen some reviews mentioning breath after eating the fish based foods.  I have to say, I haven't experienced this with my dogs.  There might be a slightly different odor to their breath, but it isn't by any means too "fishy" smelling.  Just different.  And neither dog has experienced any gasiness or changes in stool since the switch was done gradually.

review/summary: Picky Eaters Food
review/text: I have a Bichon Frise and for the longest time feeding was nothing but an endless hassle for me.  Both my dog and me would be completely stressed out because he couldn't find a food he enjoyed and I was buying tons of food that he would just stare at for hours and refuse to eat.  One day I went into a local pet food shop and they had sample packages of all the different types of foods they had and they gave me several to try out. I took them home and set them all out for my dog... he went around and sniffed at all of them but this was the one he finally went for.  A couple years of using this food later and he never seems to protest.  Thanks for making my life easier.

review/summary: Excellent food
review/text: This food is an exceptional product.  I take care of a number of dogs and am very selective about the formulation of their food.  In particular, I have one with pancreatic insufficiency, requiring a low fat content, and a little fellow who has had a bout with gastroenteritis, so needed a food with a different protein source than chicken.  Both are healthy and happy with the Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.<br />The only drawback, and it does not concern the food itself, is that Amazon uses FedEx for their delivery.  Apparently, when there is a holiday on a weekend, FedEx home delivery takes extra weekdays off.  Consequently my order arrived after my kids ran out of the food they needed.  It took 4 1/2 days for FedEx to get the parcel from the Columbus, Oh area to central West Virginia.  UPS was delivering while FedEx was still holding up my shipment, as my UPS driver passed here the day before my dog food arrived.  I have spoken to Amazon corporate headquarters about the fact that it appears UPS can get the job done more efficiently.  Perhaps a UPS option is in order for those customers who would rather not use FedUP...oops..I mean FedEx.  Hey, weren't these the guys that were hurling Christmas packages out of their trucks?

review/summary: Great Gift for the Holidays
review/text: I love giving and receiving these Lindor Truffles Assorted Gift Boxes for the holidays.  They are delicious, bite-sized gourmet chocolates that are individually wrapped.  The wrapping looks like miniature gifts with the sparkly and festive colors that look pretty around the holidays.  They look almost like miniature Christmas tree bulbs.  With the assorted flavors, everyone can find one they like at least.  And it's fun to sample the different flavors.  Dark chocolate truffles are included and everyone knows now that dark chocolate is good for you.  (Chocolate is a vegetable, after all--chocolate is a bean.) These seem to have popular appeal--even my sons and their friends like them. The host/hostess can put these out for a party, and save some for their family.  They keep well in the wrapping and are a perfect after-dinner mini dessert.  I find one is enough for a tasty treat.  If you like chocolate, you should enjoy these bite-sized chocolate treats.

review/summary: Product Looks Cheap (Not Like Picture!)
review/text: I ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend's family in December. I was meeting them for the first time over New Year's. Presentation matters for things like that! I thought it would make an elegant, classical gift; the picture looks all elegant, prettily-packed with a  bow.<br /><br />Well, the box I received looked nothing like the box in the picture. It came in a cheap-looking blue cardboard box with the same inside wrapping you'd find in a McDonald's toy. Worst of all, some of the candies had jack-o-lantern wrapping. That's fine in October, but by New Year's, it looks like old Halloween candy! I couldn't use it as a gift because I didn't want them to think I was giving them leftover Halloween candy.<br /><br />If you're ordering the box for yourself, by all means, go for it. The quality of the candies is just fine. But if you're ordering it to give as a gift, watch out! I think they just ship you the oldest (sometimes out-of-season) box they have. Together with cheap packaging, it makes even this expensive gift look careless.

review/summary: Cappaccino?
review/text: It tastes the same as the first original "International Instant Coffee". With a little sugar, it tastes ok but it's not smooth enough to call it cappaccino. Mostly I taste the powdered creamer. It would be ok to use as a base flavor to add other flavors in; especially if you added the same spices you use to make chai latte. A grocer around here would charge about $3.50 a can for it. I have to say that it tastes better than the House Blend they make for single cup coffee makers. I wouldn't buy this again though, and I'm not interested in finishing the can.

review/text: I love this pasta. We are not gluten free, but I like to change-up our grains. This pasta does not congeal like the rice pasta will. It maintains a firm shape and a good texture through the boiling process. I really like to eat the pasta the SAME DAY, because the leftover pasta seems a little dry when reheated.

review/summary: If I could stand the taste might be good for me...
review/text: The problem, for me, with this oil is that it tastes so, for lack of a better word, gross.  It was said to have a "nutty" taste, but to me it tastes like marijuana smells, only stronger.  Not an enjoyable or pleasant taste at all.  I purchased this to help with migraines, but haven't been able to stomach it.  Fortunately, I found that magnesium is helping, and going gluten free has worked miracles overall, so I am not too disappointed.  And the reason I gave this three stars?  It works great to make a beeswax, coconut, hemp oil blend that I can use for a lip balm (just melt together in the microwave and wala!),  I can't taste it when I use it this way either, as the coconut oil and especially the beeswax nicely overpower.  And my lips are feeling great this winter!

review/summary: My favorite coffee!!
review/text: I have been a fan of Peet's coffee for nearly 30 years, starting from when I was a student at UC Berkeley. Peet's had a few cafe's in Berkeley, roasting their coffee on the premises. People standing in line always got a small cup of complimentary coffee, brewed super strong and served hot and black, not for the faint-of-heart. Major Dickason's blend has long been my favorite - strong, rich, smooth. When my brother moved to Seattle he was ecstatic that he had found a local cafe that was almost as good as Peet's. The name of the cafe was Starbuck's. Some years later Starbuck's and Peet's joined forces, but eventually Starbuck's expanded internationally and Peet's chose to stay local. Peet's wanted to keep its coffee pure (not mixed with syrups and whipped cream) and didn't want to compromise its quality by expanding too quickly. I am so thankful that Peet's chose to stay true to what excellent coffee is really about, and since I moved away from Berkeley I am thankful that logistics have improved, and I can get fresh Peet's shipped to me (even now that I am living overseas).<br /><br />While I could go on and on about Peet's, which I love passionately, it is not a coffee for everyone. It is much stronger and richer than most, and some people whom I have served it to have found it to be too strong (I guess I could have brewed it with less coffee grounds or mixed some hot water in at the end, but it didn't occur to me at the time). But if you really love coffee, and you want something much much much better than Starbuck's, then you might really like Peet's.

review/text: This has become my favorite coffee.  I have tried a lot of different blends from Starbucks (from Breakfast, Verona, Columbia, and house), but a friend took me to the local Peets during a trip to Seattle two years ago and I have been hooked.  Peets has a balanced flavor that tastes great warm or cold.  Outstanding stuff.<br /><br />I will say that I can get this significantly cheaper ($8.50 per bag) at my local grocery store on the east coast than through Amazon. Its a rare day when you can say something is cheaper than going through Amazon.  Which is a shame because I wouldn't mind setting up a subscribed delivery of this product, but not at these prices.

review/summary: Great at any strength
review/text: This is not my favorite Peet's coffee blend, but it is my favorite of the offerings here at Amazon.  It is also my favorite of those blends offered at retail grocery stores.<br /><br />What I like most about it is its versatility.  We used this blend to experiment with our new single-serve coffee maker, the Jura Ena Micro 1.  This is basically an espresso maker, but it can make several strengths, and besides espresso shots, it makes ristretto and lungo cups also. We found the Major Dickason's Blend to taste rich and full-flavored made as an intense shot and also as a milder 12 oz. regular cup of coffee. Can't get much better than that!  For a coffee to provide a great brew at many different strengths is a real plus.<br /><br />Be aware that this coffee is offered in both 12 and 16 ounce bags--and the bags look alike, so do your math before asssuming one bag is cheaper than another.  I'm so glad to see Peet's products offered here at Amazon.  Peet's products are always top-notch and very fresh.  Their coffee and tea buyers really know what they are doing.

But before you cringe, the whole jar is designated as mine, so I can get away with this.

review/summary: The quintessential breakfast tea.
review/text: Given this blend's orgin, the name "English" Breakfast is a bit of a misnomer, because it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name "breakfast tea." It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word "English," which has been part of its name ever since.<br /><br />English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday "work horse," and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee.

review/text: Twinings blend of Ceylon and Indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor. In non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness, brightness, strength and flavor. Normally I wouldn't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses, trucks, and stores for long periods of time. Yet Twinings seems to hold up well. I love tea, would drink 24/7 if possible, and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and Twinings is definetly one of them.

review/summary: A straight-ahead pleasure
review/text: This Twinings tea is a simple pleasure that never offends. It is sturdy enough to be enjoyed with milk or sweetener, yet has little harshness when consumed black.<br /><br />Twinings of London was founded in 1706, and is known internationally for marketing teas of consistency and value. Twinings English Breakfast Tea was originally blended to complement the traditional, hearty English Breakfast, from which its name derives. Twinings literature tells us that this is a blend of Kenyan and Assam black teas.<br /><br />Tea enthusiasts generally prefer loose tea to tea bags which contain less expensive, smaller particles and the "fannings" or "dust" remains from processing of loose leaf tea. Moreover, you can sometimes taste the paper used in bags, especially in the weaker teas.<br /><br />However, this Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses only small particles that infuse more quickly than whole leaves. This blend approaches full strength within just a couple minutes. To avoid excessive particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)<br /><br />This product is a fine introduction to the world of loose tea. Would I rank it as my favorite tea or even my favorite Twinings? No, but I keep some available for when I want the pleasure of plain ol' tea. (As an aside, I would rank Twinings' Earl Grey a bit higher in quality. It is a whole leaf tea with just the right amount of bergamot orange flavoring. I don't think of it as an everyday tea, but I enjoy it as an occasional pleasure.)

review/summary: Good, but very finely cut...
review/text: Twinings English Breakfast tea is a good, basic black tea (as is its stronger cousin, Irish Breakfast tea). But I find this loose tea to be a bit of a challenge. It is cut quite finely and no matter how fine the mesh on the infuser or strainer some of this always comes through. I drink a lot of tea and am fine with drinking some tea dust or even a few leaves, but I am talking about a lot of tea here...a teaspoon full or more in each cup.<br /><br />It is true that this tastes better than the bagged variety of Twinings English Breakfast tea. It is smoother and never bitter, as the bagged tea sometimes is. I have compromised and used the loose tea but I strain it through a coffee filter. The tins the tea comes in keep it quite fresh and though straining it is a hassle, it is worth it for me.<br /><br />This is moderately strong (I drink it black) and if you are sensitive to caffeine you might not want to drink it near bedtime. I use Amazon's Subscribe and Save program for this tea; it is a good bargain and I like the convenience of having it delivered. It is also hard to find the loose tea in supermarkets.

I should say - not sealed or half way sealed - all 4 boxes only had the hermetic sealing to about 80% - rest was open.  All 4 boxes were entirely inedible.  I was shipped 4 boxes of expensive stale crap.

review/summary: My Dog Thinks This Is Her Treat For the Day!
review/text: When my vet told me my little Yorkie had stage IV luxating patellas (knees blown out), I was devastated. The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the "chicken flavor" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online.  They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition.  This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos.<br /><br />As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended "Golden Aloe" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well. She's my best friend, I'm on disability and won't be able to afford the surgery if and when it's required so I am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only 3 years old.

review/summary: Love this product
review/text: Our 10 year old lab mix started having problemswith his hip joints. He has always been an active dog and watching him lay around and not want to interact was hard to see. Initially our vet gave us Rimadyl to get him through the acute phase, but it is a bit pricey and I know that it is hard on their stomach and kidneys. I searched the internet and read reviews for several days, each time my reasearch led me back to this product. Off I went to the local pet supply store to get this treat. When I opened the bag I thought for sure that my dog would turn his nose up at them, they smell awful....well my husband now calls these "doggie crack", our dog LOVES these treats. As soon as he sees the bag he RUNS to get his snack. Yep RUNS. Not only am I giving him something he loves but something that has helped him with mobility. I followed directions I found at a vets website to double the dose for several weeks and then give a maintenance dose of glucosamine after that....what a difference!!! Shop around as I only purchase these at the local store if I make a mistake and run out! There is quite a difference in price from stores to online. I am completely sold on this product and have now started purchasing some of their other treats and products as well!! Can't go wrong with Zukes!

review/summary: Natural treat our Bichon loves!  A plus for his joints!
review/text: We've been feeding our Bichon Zuke's hip action treats for years.  He gets one each day after breakfast and expects it.  He has had two knee operations which was one reason we looked for a treat targeted for joints, etc.<br /><br />I only rated a 4 because I have no idea if the Zuke's hip action really does work in terms of improved mobility.  Yes, he loves the treats; yes, he walks every day; and yes, we're hoping the Zuke's is working to aid his mobility.  Nevertheless, he loves the Zuke's treat and we like the fact that they're made in the USA and are natural.  Just note of caution for Bichon owners with urinary stone issues; don't feed a Bichon beef products.  The chicken is great.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/17/10<br />I've updated my rating to a 5 because I recently took our dog to the vet who confirmed, at the age of 12 going on 13, he has no arthritis.  In fact, both front and back legs have full mobility.  I do attribute part of this success to his walking every day but also to Zuke's hip action treats.  Digby's had a Zuke's hip action treat for years and this treat is the only joint action remedy we feed him in addition to Nupro All Natural Dog Suppplement for his other nutrients, minerals, and vitamins.  While Zuke's hip action treats are not the only reason he is doing so well, I believe this treat in conjunction with exercise and the proper diet have significantly contributed to his overall well being!

They said she might have cancer on her leg and probably need to cut off her leg.<br />I didn't have the money to take her back to the vet to check up again when is was crying in pain. So then I read others reviews on Amazon and found Zuke's. I immediately bought it and gave her 2 doses a day for a week. And now she is running around the house ans jumps again. My dog doesn't like the taste but I sandwiched between the sliced cheese and she eat it with no problem. Thank you so much Zuke's. From now on I will buy every month for her.

review/summary: Thank God for Zuke's Dad!
review/text: Knowing his mother's agony, my son let his dog remain at home when he moved out, and, already spoiled, Raider became the center of our world. We would do anything for him and he returned our love tenfold. At the age of 12, our little pupcake began *screaming* whenever attempting to rise from sleep. Throughout that year his pain grew far greater...my husband and I were *forced* to have "that talk".  How much pain was too much pain? Were we just letting him live because we couldn't bear to let him go?<br /><br />On a trip to Utah, our friends saw the anguish overwhelming us.  They recommended we try Zuke's.  HOURS later, Raider was *running* for the first time in years!  He is now a happy 17-year-old, and ONLY ran into trouble the ONE time his Mommy was late in refilling the Zuke's. I kid you naught, the screaming is GONE, and has been since Day One.  We owe *so* much to that awesome hiker who owned Zuke and developed this 'treat' to help him out. As much as we wouldn't wish pain on anyone, we're so thankful Zuke had *such* a smart Daddy!!!

review/summary: Doggy Likes!
review/text: My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats.

review/summary: Nearly Miraculous
review/text: I don't usually bother with reviews, but these results pretty much demanded it. Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again. Previously, it had been years since he would run with me any longer than about twenty minutes, and by the end of the run I would be dragging him behind me... this week I took him for a run and he went with me for an HOUR! And he was still ahead of me when we finished!! We're so hopeful that he'll be able to enjoy his "golden years" without the misery of a poorly aging dog. I'm completely a believer in this product, and we'll be giving them to every dog we ever own. (Plus, you just saved me a bundle on an expensive pet bed.) ;D

review/text: Our older dog, Broccoli, has been quietly aging.  Sleeping on the couch instead of the bed, not jumping up, rarely playing...it all started so gradually we didn't really notice until he was virtually sleeping all day.  His hips were so stiff when he walked, his gate stilted and he never ran anymore.<br /><br />A friend and I were talking about his decreased mobility a few weeks ago and she recommended we try glucosamine and chondroitin, so we purchased Zuke's Hip Action (beef.)  After two weeks of feeding him a double dose, we've noticed a HUGE change.  While some stiffness in his hips is still evident, he's been running around, jumping on the bed, jumping up on his back legs and playing much more often and for longer periods of time.  Where he would once play for a few seconds and then lie down, he's now begging to play and run around.  I can't wait to see his progress in a month.  We plan to reduce the amount to the one treat a day (recommended for his size) after 6 weeks, per recommendations I've read online.  We're also giving a treat to our new puppy every day to ward off any future problems and keep his joints healthy (he's a greyhound mix with really long legs, so we're concerned about the various bone/joint problems that he could be prone to.)<br /><br />As far as taste, both dogs LOVE these treats, more than any other we've tried in fact.  We'll be giving Zuke's as a daily supplement from now on, as we're firm believers in the benefits of them.  I'm so glad to see my old friend acting like a puppy again.  Thank you Zuke's!

I figure there is no placebo effects for animals so that can't be it. The treats must have had an effect on her mobility and pain. I will be a repeat customer.

review/summary: After a month, I am a believer
review/text: I purchased both the beef and chicken flavor Hip Action about a month ago and was very skeptical for a couple of reasons. First, my dog has not liked any other Glucosomine treats I've given him in the past. The pills were difficult to get in him as well. I was also skeptical I would see any difference. My dog is a 12 year old Husky-Great Pyrenese mix and weighs about 100 pounds. He has extreme arthritis is all four legs and it is increasingly difficult for him to go up and down our stairs. After giving him 4 of these treats per day for a little over a month now, we are seeing a difference. I am so surprised! He seems to feel better and though the steps are still a challenge, he is getting up them in one try now instead of three of four tries. And, most importantly, he loves these treats! Thank you! Knowing our time left with this most important member of our family is getting shorter, I am so relieved I can make him a little more comfortable in the last stages of his life.

review/summary: My PUPPY loves these!  They aren't just for older dogs
review/text: I have a 5 month old Pomeranian puppy.  Poms have a tendency to develop collapsed tracheas and also have issues with luxating patellas (knee problems).  Both areas are made of cartilage.  I give him one of these per day to make sure that we strengthen his cartilage/joints so that we can try to prevent or delay these issues that may develop later (and hopefully some vet bill money down the road!).  He loves these things and the chewy texture of them (I must admit, they smell good to me too, haha)!  These little guys live for a very long time typically, and I want him to have a very happy and healthy life - there is nothing like the power of prevention.  I love that they are made in the USA and not in China, and that it's very healthy for him.. very natural.

review/summary: Absolutly a Godsend
review/text: This product is amazing!  We had a gift card for an out of town feed store and my husband happened to pick this up.  We have an older Rott/Boarder Collie who has been having joint, arthritis trouble.  The vet has given him several medications.  One he won't eat unless I  force it and the other makes him act "wonky".  The vet says I shouldn't have a problem with either product, but I know my dog! Anyway, because of this fluke purchase, his mobility and attitude improved by "leaps and bounds" within two weeks!  He no longer cries or yelps when he tries to get up and he is much more playful.  Bucky, our dog, is also allergic to corn.  It isn't easy to find a "treat" that doesn't have corn. This product is free of corn and other additives i.e. wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors, added fat or by-products.  The only thing I could wish for is disclosure of the caloric content.  I don't know how many calories are in a treat.  We use this in conjunction with a senior glucosamine /condroiton dog food. The 1lb pk that we purchased was $17 and a 45 minute trip out of town.  I'm down to one treat. He takes three (huge dog) a day.  I decided to see if I could get it on line.  Everything I found was still expensive especially with S&H.  And, then I thought maybe Amazon.  Sure enough there it was.  So, thanks to Amazon.  But more importantly, greatful thanks to Zuke's for a miracle product.  Couldn't be more happy.  God gave us a great gift when he gave us all our furry friends!

It was so easy just to order them from Amazon...I had gotten the Prime membership for kinda the same reasons...new city and difficulty finding my "go to" purchases.  Sparkle was delighted.

review/text: I have an older shih-tzu who is over weight and starting to have some hip problems. We bought here these treats to hide her daily pills in. They are so perfect, they are so soft that they can squish around her pills easily. They are also easy to chop up into smaller pieces and use as training treats!

review/summary: Hip Hip Hooray for Zuke's
review/text: We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement, Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat, corn, soy, by-products, or artificials.<br /><br />Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine, but I've taken it for years with wonderful results, and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.<br /><br />These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course, I'll be ordering another.

review/text: We have a border collie/husky. She is 13 years old and we love her dearly. She has such a sweet disposition. I keep the Zuke's treats in a basket in the utility room. Whenever I go to that room, Sasha follows me and starts doing some of her tricks on her own hoping she will get one of her treats she loves. Judy Watson

review/summary: My 3 dogs love these
review/text: I've started giving these to 2 of my dogs which are a very large breed.  They aren't really old yet, but we have mostly wood and tile floors which are hard on their joints.  So I've started giving them these in hopes of preventing - to some extent - damage and pain for them. They love these.  My small dog isn't very old, but wants them, too.  I don't think they are so good for her since she has thrown them up before.  The pieces are fairly large so the dog knows she's getting a real treat.  I haven't found any flavor that they don't like, although the Beef seems to be their favorite.  I like that they seem to be a made in the USA product since I lost a dog during the "bad dog food" epidemic. Since then, I've been very careful what I give my dogs.

review/text: I have 2 large dogs who are getting older and a little slower now, so I got these for them.  They will do just about anything for them.  I also have a small dog who is young and she wants them, too.  I like that there is nothing harmful in them and that they are a USA product.  It is a much more healthful treat and supplement than many that are available.  I will be buying these again.

review/summary: Best Product for the Price!
review/text: I have tried a lot of different arthritis supplements for my small dogs, but this one is the best product I have found for the price.  My dogs love it and it is wonderful to see them running around where before they could hardly move for the pain.  Granted, they are old (one is 17 and one is 13) but I believe this product has given them a better quality of life, which, after all, is exactly what we want for our pets.

review/summary: It Works!
review/text: We have a 15-year old arthritic Siberian Husky.  We had tried over-the-counter glucosamine for him, but it did nothing.  A vet then told us most pills sold over-the-counter are poor quality and do not sufficiently digest and enter the bloodstream...for humans or dogs.  We later tried Zuke's Hip Action, and definitely saw a difference.  We have been using them for several years now.  Our dog's arthritis progressed, so he's now on prescription meds and senior dog food (which also has gulcosamine), but he's doing great...running up and down stairs, playing.  People think he's a puppy!  He quickly tired of the beef flavor Hip Action, but still loves the peanut butter flavor.  We'll continue using this product as long as we have our dog.

review/text: I have an elderly dog with hip and joint problems. She has been taking Zuke's Hip Action Dog treats for a little more than a month and there has been a HUGE difference in her. She loves the way the treats taste; and best of all she is walking with ease, has an easier time with stairs and yesterday broke into a full sprint for the first time in ages! We followed the guideline for her size as listed on the back of the package and have been so surprised by the results. We love Zuke's!

review/summary: Soft, Chewable, Yummy Treats for Your Aging/Arthritic Dog
review/text: I buy these for my nine year old Chihuahua. He has bad knees, hips, and back. He also has lost the majority of his teeth due to former owners who neglected his dental health. He loves these and they seem to help him a lot. When I pull out the bag, he starts doing his tricks hoping I'll give him one just for doing them! He can eat them easily even without the majority of his teeth, although I do break them into smaller pieces since he is only about 5 pounds.<br />These treats seem to have really improved his mobility and stamina. He skips less(to get his kneecap back in place), bunny hops less(because his hips hurt him), and jumps on the bed without any help(he used to stand on the top of his pet stairs and wait for me to pick him up). He's always had tons of energy, but now his body can keep up with him better.

review/summary: Fixed My Dogs Hip
review/text: I rescued my havanese dog from a breeder who was going to put her down for a hip deformity. Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past.

review/summary: Great for my older Border Collie
review/text: Both of my dogs love these treats! My border collie has been having problems with stiffness in her back legs so I thought I would give these a try. I have been giving them to her everyday for about a month and just last weekend she racied me down the stairs outside!!!  And she won!!! I really think these are helping her, so I'm on "Subscribe and Save" and will keep giving them to her forever if it keeps her out of pain. I also give one to my yorkie. No hip/lep problems there but maybe we can head em off at the pass!! They LOVE how they taste and both sit patiently waiting for their treat!!! Thank you Zuke's!!!!
