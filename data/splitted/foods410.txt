review/summary: One of our favorites
review/text: We found this because, in reading "The Number One Ladies Detective Agency" series (Alexander McCall), I was curious about the "bush tea" the heroine drinks and found it to be Rooibus.  We like Two Leaves and a Bud teas because they're loose teas in a bag, not "tea dust," as the company says. If the 1/2 pound loose tea were available on Amazon, I'd buy it that way.  Bags are much better for traveling, of course.  We have bought Rooibus, green tea loose, better belly blend, better sleep blend, chamomile loose and enjoy them all, but Rooibus (African Sunset) is our favorite, hot or cold, with nothing added (my wife) or with honey or a very slight touch of stevia (me).

review/summary: Try them - they are great!
review/text: If you haven't tried these, you really should. They are made with actual real fruit, no unpronounceable ingredients, and are delicious. These are my kids favorite snack, and it is great to have 'packaged food' that I can throw in my purse in case we need a snack while we are out, that I still feel like is real food. My kids love them, but so do all the adults I know - they are really good. I was excited to see them here - we have been having family in Canada send them to us for years.

review/summary: I LOVE this stuff!!!
review/text: Of all the McCormick Grill Mates, this is my favorite.  Whether I use it for outdoor grilling, smoking, or indoor cooking, it always makes whatever I'm cooking better.  I've used it on steaks, spare ribs, pork chops, hamburger -- you name it, if it's meat, I've used this delicious rub on it!<br /><br />To give you an idea of my tastes, I've used the following three varieties of Grill Mates: Molasses Bacon (a close second to this), Barbecue, and Applewood (which, IMO, was way too spicy.  The Sweet & Smoky gives the perfect blend to satisfy my sweet tooth and my craving for smoked meat.  My husband loves this as much as I do (and he's much harder to please than I am).<br /><br />BTW, my grocery store sells this for more than $5 a jar.  With Subscribe & Save, it works out to $3.37 per jar.  That'll keep me stocked for awhile.  :-)

review/text: "And God gave man this ineffable substance from His own tentacle so that delicious nourishment could be had whilst remaining lean.  Amen."<br /><br />Ok, onto the actual review.  This pancake mix was sitting on my shelf for probably a year before my pancake craving got so bad that I tried something which I felt reasonably sure would be awful.  It wasn't!<br /><br />In fact, it was great.  I've been eating pancakes about every other day since first trying it.  However, I use organic skim milk instead of water to mix with the powder.  Usually throw in a handful of frozen blueberries too.  It tastes almost exactly like any buttermilk pancake you would get at a restaurant or make at home (sometimes far better), and since it's good for you there's no diet-cheating guilt.  Just tasty high protein pancakes.<br /><br />MetRX MET=Rx Protein Plus High Protein Pancake Mix is highly recommended for simply getting in shape, body building, or just making yummy, unbelievably easy pancakes.  5 stars!

review/text: I bought these, along with other nice decoration, for my Grandchildren to decorate tree shaped cakes, snowman shaped and round cupcakes with.  They had such a great time, putting the candy canes in the snowman's hands, around the trees like a garland and of course, putting them into the designs they made on the round cakes.  A great time was had by all and we all enjoyed eating the left overs, which taste great.  These are wonderful decorations for just about any edible items that you want a nice touch added to.  They are easy to handle, taste good and, surprise surprise, do not fade off on tiny wet hands.  If you are in need of a great decoration for anything at Christmas (or maybe anytime) these are it.  This seller also has some others that are just as great.  Have fun shopping.

review/text: I enjoy Bigelow's Green Teas (especially the Green Tea with Peach as noted in one of my other reviews).  I enjoy this tea as well.  When steeped properly, it has a delicate flavor with hints of pomegranate and acai but not overpowering.  It is not nearly as strong, in my opinion, as Bigelow's Green Tea (original flavor) but delivers a wonderful organic option that I enjoy almost daily (trading on & off with my Bigelow Green Tea w/ Peach).  Subscribe & Save delivery once again makes this an affordable and worthwhile purchase.<br /><br />I highly recommend to any lovers of green teas, herbal teas, and/or organic teas.

review/summary: A marketing fad does not make for a nice tea
review/text: "Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai" seems more like an attempt to cash in on a health fad instead of creating a balanced and delicious tea.  Here you have three products that have recently been hailed as miracle foods all bundled into one cuppa together.<br /><br />Although the health benefits and drawbacks of both green tea and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932657746">pomegranate juice</a> have been well-documented, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZWTDS">Acai berry's</a> claims are more tenuous.  Acai berries have fewer antioxidants than grapes or blueberries, and no credible evidence exists supporting the other miraculous claims.  Even so, with this tea listing "pomegranate and acai flavors" as the final ingredient on the package, the amount of each fruit is so minimal as to be inconsequential.  There is far more "organic hibiscus" and "organic rose hips" in this tea than either pomegranate or acai "flavors."<br /><br />But the real bottom line on any tea is the "Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai" just doesn't taste very nice.  It tastes like none of the listed ingredients, and comes off as more of an attempt at making <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5DG0">Kool-Aid</a>-flavored  tea than anything else.

review/summary: Absolutlely the best chocolate tea I have ever tasted!
review/text: All of my Serenity House Teas arrived today and they couldn't have arrived on a better day:  I had to have a 3 hour MRI and my back was terribly sore, it was miserable outside weather wise, cold, rainy, dark and dreary.  When I opened the box, the very first tea I came upon was the Double Double Chocolate.  I made a pot in my new Breville Automatic Tea Maker which has a automatic infuser basket which is wonderful for making the perfect pot of tea.<br /><br />I could smell the chocolate flavor filling the kitchen from the "Double Double Chocolate leaves."  In fact when I opened the factory sealed bag from Serenity House the aroma of the chocolate tea leaves was so aromatic it was heavenly!<br /><br />When I poured the cup I thought I would need to add sugar but decided to take a sip first and I was glad I did!  The tea was perfect!  The chocolate flavor was out of this world!<br /><br />This is the perfect tea for anytime but especially when you may be feeling a little down, or you might have the need to lift someone's spirits as a gift, or a pick me up, or for that<br />special time when you want to tell someone "you care" or as a "get well present" to the chocolate lover in your life.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea!<br /><br />I did buy 7 or 8 other teas from this vendor and I must say that I was highly impressed by the speed of shipment, the packaging, the way the teas were wrapped and the care they took to individualize my shipment.  I am very delighted with the service I received and I know I will be ordering again!<br /><br />By the way, the labeling on the Serenity House teas are perfect!  There are instructions on the front and very clear instructions on the back as well.  Unlike other teas that you order online from other vendors, Serenity House takes all the guess work out of how to make the perfect cup of tea!<br /><br />Thank you, thank you, thank you!

However, on several different occasions, I made some for my husband just as he was starting to show signs of getting sick, and he is convinced that the tea prevented him from getting a full-blown cold. Now he SWEARS by the stuff and asks me to make him some of that &quot;tea with china in it&quot; (for e-CHINA-cea) whenever he starts to get symptoms.<br /><br /> The tea has a pleasant herbal taste that is perfectly enhanced with a little honey but fine without as well. As an added bonus, the box describes simple yoga stretches to provide relaxation and stress relief, and the tag of each tea bag offers a brief meditation. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Great Immune Booster, Yummy and Unusual Tasting Tea
review/text: *****<br /><br />This Echinacea Immune Support herbal tea from Yogi Tea is for the natural boosting of the immune system. It's an all natural tea made from organic peppermint leaf, organic ;lemon grass, organic Echinacea root (angustifolia, purprea, pallida), organic licorice root, organic cinnamon bark, organic spearmint leaf, organic fennel seed, organic lemon flavor, Echinacea purpurea root extract (phenols 12%), organic cardamom seed, organic rose hips, organic ginger root, organic burdock root, stevia leaf, organic mullein leaf, organic clove bud, astragalus root extract, organic black pepper, European elder berry extract (30% anthocyanins), natural cinnamon oil, natural cardamom oil, natural ginger oil. Whew! Lots of good ingredients!<br /><br />The taste is unusual and hard to define, probably because there are so many interesting ingredients. It is slightly tonic-y but very pleasant. I love all the things that these herbs are purported to do!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with Echinacea Immune Support and with Yogi Teas in general. Echinacea Immune Support comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Echinacea Immune Support tea is a superior blend of several species of Organic Echinacea Root (Echinacea angustifolia, purpurea, pallida) designed to boost your immune system. Each tea bag is made with organic Echinacea Root and Echinacea Root extract, containing the equivalent of 1,400 mg of Echinacea. Health practitioners for centuries have respected the powers of Echinacea, an herb that supports the body's natural defense system by stimulating production of immune system proteins, interferons, that regulate normal immune response. Furthermore, Echinacea supplies certain naturally-occurring plant compounds known as caffeic acid derivatives, including cichoric acid, alkylamides and polysaccharides. These work together to stimulate the body's immune system. The blend is complemented with Astragalus, a stamina-enhancing tonic that also boosts long-term immune function, and European Elder Berry, which is immune-enhancing and supports respiratory function. To support sinus function and promote clear breathing passages, Organic Peppermint and Organic Lemon Grass are included.* Finally, Organic Cinnamon , Organic Fennel, Organic Spearmint, and Organic Rose Hips add a wonderful fragrant essence to this delicious herbal supplement."<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. The box says, "When your immune system seems a bit down, drink 2 to 3 cups per day. For increased immune stimulation, drink 4 to 5 cups per day."<br /><br />This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****

review/text: I always feel run down & i tend to get sick a lot.  But since i've beem drinking this tea i have so much energy & i feel really good.  I catch colds a lot & they really knock me on my butt.  One day about 2 weeks after i first bought this tea i was getting sniffles & felt extra tired.  I thought "here comes another cold".  So i had 3 cups of this tea & i actually woke up feeling fine. I drank another cup that day just to be sure, and low & behold i didn't get sick.  Believe me i always get sick but NOT THIS TIME! Just some sniffles, nothing i couldn't easily handle. It's really amazing stuff.<br /><br />By the way the flavor is wonderful. It tastes light & minty sweet.  This tea is so good i actually crave it.  I wish amazon had a 12 pack deal  because i really need to stock up on this stuff!

review/summary: Immune Booster, Yummy and Unusual Tasting Tea
review/text: *****<br /><br />This Echinacea Immune Support herbal tea from Yogi Tea is for the natural boosting of the immune system. It's an all natural caffeine-free tea made from organic peppermint leaf, organic lemon grass, organic Echinacea root (angustifolia, purprea, pallida), organic licorice root, organic cinnamon bark, organic spearmint leaf, organic fennel seed, organic lemon flavor, Echinacea purpurea root extract (phenols 12%), organic cardamom seed, organic rose hips, organic ginger root, organic burdock root, stevia leaf, organic mullein leaf, organic clove bud, astragalus root extract, organic black pepper, European elder berry extract (30% anthocyanins), natural cinnamon oil, natural cardamom oil, natural ginger oil. Whew! Lots of good ingredients!<br /><br />The taste is unusual and hard to define, probably because there are so many interesting ingredients. It is slightly tonic-y but very pleasant. I love all the things that these herbs are purported to do!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with Echinacea Immune Support and with Yogi Teas in general. Echinacea Immune Support comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Unbelievable Product!
review/text: A local seafood restaurant offered herbs de provence as a source of broiled seafood. It is just wonderful! After falling in love with that taste; I sought herbs de provence in its best form. This grinder is absolutely the best! It grinds down some of the larger, rougher spices into a smaller format which is easier to digest and apply to seafood, chicken, etc. I use it on so many foods! Chicken and seafood is a given. Just spray your "to be broiled" seafood or chicken with some light oil and apply the herbs to both sides. It gives the meat a wonderful flavor.<br />I also now make very light, low calorie tarter sauce with the herbs. I use very light ranch dressing; add chopped pickles, herbs de provence and dill; along with chopped onions occassionally. The tarter sauce is much better in taste and has almost no calories. Buy this product! I almost never use italian foods and this is my most used herb. Do an internet search on the herb as a whole. It is just the best combination ever.

review/summary: "Fresh" herbs in a convenient form
review/text: Both the Toscany and Provence Herb spice grinders are a handy way to have fresh herb flavors in a convenient form.  Both of these grinders do an excellent job of providing a fine grind of herb mixes (including garlic) to almost any dish.  These are well prepared, dried herbs that add a splash of flavor to your cooking.  The attached grinder does a great job of very finely grinding, so flavor is maximized.  Highly recommended, along with the Garlic grinder too!

review/summary: Drinkable Espresso
review/text: With the pods & the Lavazza machine you get a shot of espresso with the push of the button.  The pods make it super easy (though they're probably not eco friendly).  I have a double espresso every morning and have found the crema to consistently produce the most flavorful and creamy espresso shots. While the crema is strong espresso, it does not produce the jolt that some coffee house espressos do.  On the other hand, it is smoother, less harsh and very "drinkable".  The coffee houses have not been getting my money in the morning for quite a while now.

SHe LOVES them, and amazingly she says these taste just like the ones in the UK.  Usually when you buy foreign chocolate over here in the U.S. it's different, unless you have it special ordered internationally.  Pay attention to that, some of these sellers are from Germany - that's good.  Then you know it's authentic.  I'm not much of a chocolate buff really but this stuff is GOOD.

review/summary: I thought I hated milk chocolate
review/text: I thought I hated milk chocolate...until I had this bar!  I've had really bad experiences with American milk chocolate bars being too sickingly sweet in the past, but it all changed one day when I went to Asia last year.  One day when I was browsing a supermarket for a chocolate bar to satisfy my craving, this was the only type of foreign chocolate bar available.  I decided to try this bar due to its brand popularity and at the same time avoiding the rows of Hersheys and Dove chocolates I've seen all over the U.S.<br /><br />Oh my gosh.  Can we say mouthgasm?  On a MILK chocolate bar?  Needless to say, I am no longer snooty toward milk chocolate.  This bar is amazingly rich without being too sweet, and entire hazelnuts scattered throughout the bar just make it taste even better and further helps combat the added sweetener in the bar.  At the price of roughly $2.70 a bar, I definitely think this is a steal.  I do want to give a warning about it melting easily, so be careful about shipping in hot weather.

review/summary: The price of erythritol and oligofructose have nothing to do with it.
review/text: Both of those sugars can be purchased cheap at any low carb online store (netrition has it for $7.50 for 1 lb!), and if I can purchase it that cheap, then you KNOW they're getting it dirt cheap.  The price is high because low-carbers are desperate for sweets that won't add much to their daily carb intake; and Low carb specialties (the makers of these bars) know it. I've purchased these bars twice before and loved them; but I took the price personally.  Yes, it's true, no one forced me to purchase them, but that's besides the point.  You end up feeling like prey every time you see the price of your favorite items through the roof when you're desperate for something sweet.  EVERY producer of low carb sweets pull that stunt; however, you'll find all your "non-sweet" products, such as condiments, etc., moderately priced.  It's no coincidence.  If you have the time, purchase ghirardelli unsweetened chocolate from Amazon, add a sucralose sweetener (Please see JJ's recommendation below)-preferably in liquid form, so there's no carbs-, add some cream, melt and you're done.  You just saved 2/3 what you would've payed for these chocolates. Any other sweets you find online can be duplicated with minimal effort as well.  Just google it and fatten that purse.

review/summary: Please stop calling this great chocolate....
review/text: I'm a low-carb lifer, who also is a certified chocoholic, so I've tried most of the low-carb sweets on the market.  I purchased a full box of these, so I had a chance to "live" with them for several weeks.  I have to wonder if the other reviewers calling this "great" chocolate have ever actually tried anything beyond Hersheys.  Because while it's perfectly edible, it is very far from great.  Have you ever had one of those cheap chocolate bunnies they sell around Easter?  They cost $2, and taste like very cheap chocolate?  That's exactly what this tastes like.  Again, it's not horrible, and it's perfectly edible, but using the word "great" when describing this chocolate is like using the word "great" when describing a Chevy Cavalier automobile.  It's entirely inaccurate.  This tastes like cheap chocolate, but for what it is intended - low carb eating without terrible stomach distress - it does work.  But please don't buy this thinking you're getting a wonderful chocolate experience.  It's not even as good as a Nestle bar, and it's like eating tree bark compared to Recchiuti, or Fazer from Finland, or even Godiva.  Would I buy it again?  No, I'd rather eat Lindt 85% dark and take in 1-2 carbs of real chocolate.  But if I were forced to a life of sugar-free chocolate, this would be acceptable.

review/summary: Waxy, Too thick, Gas-causing
review/text: It's challenging to create a chocolate bar with erythritol or xylitol without compromising texture and flavor ("cooling" effect). But it IS doable! I've ordered chocolates sweetened with xylitol or erythritol from 3 other manufacturers, and I was pleasantly surprised that they weren't waxy. This one, unfortunately, is so waxy that it doesn't taste like chocolate at all.<br /><br />Some people liken these bars to Easter bunnies, but don't the bunnies have a better mouthfeel? Perhaps it's due to the fact that the bunnies are thin (hollow), and therefore kind of elegant. This bar is a very thick solid block - difficult to bite.<br /><br />What made it even worse in my case - I happened to try the Almond variety, and they contained INTACT almonds! Other manufacturers break almonds into small pieces, and that's what creates an elegant experience. Eating this one felt like alternating between putting a plain almond and a piece of sweetened wax in the mouth.<br /><br />Finally, they contain oligofructose (FOS), which causes gas in sensitive people. Some may get bloated from eating just 1/3 of this bar.<br /><br />The alternatives that I mentioned above are:<br /><br />- The best one by far was a custom order from a small maker. E-mail cocosrawchocolates at yahoo, and she will make it the way you want. FANTASTIC!!!<br />- Lucienne's - I haven't tried their improved version yet. The previous version, while flavorful and with decent texture, was too acidic to my taste (I usually eat 90%-cocoa bars, but only non-acidic);<br />- Healthy Chocolate (their product is sold under several labels, e.g. "Xyla") - although it wasn't waxy, it still lacked the right texture and flavor, was very boring (opinion shared by relatives and friends);

review/summary: Good Tasting, But Can Cause Gastric Distress
review/text: The ChocoPerfection "Sugar Free Dark Chocolate Bars" are indeed good tasting, but did cause me to experience some fairly spectacular "gastric distress". I bought a box of these when they came up on Woot and was excited about getting a Maltitol free, diabetic friendly chocolate bar with only 2 net carbs.<br /><br />While I knew that Maltitol caused me gastric issues, I thought these would be safe since Erythritol is OK for me and ate one before heading out of the house. Sadly I suspect the Oligofructose brought on a very unpleasant reaction that was more than a little embarrassing since it occurred at very public event. Further tests in privacy of my home confirmed that these bars were the cause of the unpleasantness.<br /><br />Recommended for the flavor and low-carb count, but make sure you know if they will "effect" you before heading out to enclosed places with a lot of people. Ironically, my non-diabetic son doesn't have a reaction to these and enjoys the taste so at least they won't go to waste.<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Healthiest/tastiest chocolate bar I have ever found
review/text: This is the most delicious and healthiest chocolate bar I have ever tasted. It is sugar free, with 14 grams of fiber. There are no artificial sweeteners, and the taste is incredibly rich and creamy. I recommend buying the dark chocolate rather than the milk chocolate version because dark chocolate has all those important polyphenols. It is a little pricey but worth every penny.

review/summary: This chocolate is awesome, but this vendor is overpriced
review/text: This chocolate is divine.  It is rich, does not cause stomach upset and melts like high carb chocolate.<br /><br />I wish amazon carried it at a reasonable price since I am already ordering so much stuff from here, but this chocolate is very over-priced at the time of this review.  You can get 12 bars of any flavor on netrition's website for thirty four dollars instead of the fifty dollars that is currently listed here, they ship anywhere for a flat rate of $4.95 and have a lot of sugar free and low carb items so I am always ordering a lot of stuff and pay just $4.95 shipping, even if the package weighs 20 pounds.<br /><br />Another option is to buy the two poundbags of dark chocolate buttons directly from the low carb specialty website for fourty five dollars with free shipping that includes an ice pack -- per ounce, this is the least expensive way of enjoying Chocoperfection dark chocolate.  The buttons are about an inch across and easier to portion out since a whole bar is too much for me and cannot be divided in half easily; the bars are made up of 5 scored blocks -- so you can have 2 or 3, I wish it was scored evenly.<br /><br />Anyway, I have tried making my own SF chocolate with varied results.  I use the buttons for lots of recipes with no guess work needed.  I often blend it with unsweetened chocolate for really dark chocolate flavor.  What I find really good is to melt 2 ounces ChocoPerfection buttons with 1 ounce of unsweetened chocolate and blend with 2-3 ounces organic heavy whipping cream.  Let it set in the fridge and then roll into small balls and dust with unsweetened cocoa, nearly instant truffles with no sugar added!  I use a premium unsweetened chocolate for best results, but any bar found in the baking isle at your grocery store would work.  I don't usually add extra sweetener for the truffle recipe, but I may add a bit of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HBVYP2">NuNaturals NuStevia No Carb Blend, 1,000 Packets</a> if I need it sweeter -- that stuff rocks also.

review/summary: Delicious chocolate way to get 14grams of fiber and only 2 net carbs per bar
review/text: These Chocoperfection bars taste so good, you'll never believe they are good for you!  I get these at my local Jimbo's for $3.85each but am hoping they will be available from Amazon soon!  What a delicious way to g35 14grams of fiber!<br /><br />Instead of sugar, Chocoperfection uses erythritol which has 95% fewer calories than sugar, 93% fewer than maltitol, and no effect on insulin levels, and oligofructose, a sweet tasting dietary fiber made primarily from chicory (not the same as fructose).<br /><br />These silky-smooth, delicious chocolate bars actually help you lose weight because the high fiber content and the high fiber content also acts as an appetite suppressant.<br /><br />And unlike maltitol-sweetened chocolate, ChocoPerfection bars will never upset your stomach, give you gas, make you bloat, or stall your weight loss.  Chocolate Perfect!<br /><br />On top of all that, Chocoperfection is diabetic-safe and tooth-freindly, too.  What more could you ask of a chocolate bar?<br /><br />What is erythritol?<br /><br />Like xylitol, erythritol is a polyol or sometimes called a sugar-alcohol (although none of them contain sugar or alcohol,) and has some of the cavity-fighting similarities.<br /><br />Xylitol is as sweet as sugar and has about 2/3 the calories.<br /><br />Erythritol, on the other hand, is about 70% as sweet as sugar and and almost zero calories.  Plus it is better tolerated by most people<br /><br />with less gastronomical or laxative reactions.  By the way, XylitolNow sells erythritol in bulk on the main product page.<br /><br />Being only 70% as sweet as sugar, erythritol sometimes needs a little help in the sweetness department. In the case of these bars, that's where oligofrutose comes in.<br /><br />What is oligofructose?<br /><br />Oligofructose<br />From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br /><br />Oligofructose, sometimes called Fructooligosaccharide or just  (FOS), is a subgroup of inulin, specifically those fructose polymers with a degree of polymerization (DP) &lt;= 10. Unlike most carbohydrates, it is not digested in the human small intestine and thus has a lower calorific value, whilst contributing to dietary fiber. Oligofructose is on the more soluble side, due to its lower chain length, than the general class of inulins and is therefore commonly used as an additive to yoghurt and other dairy products. It is used specially in combination with high-intensity artificial sweeteners, whose sweetness profile and aftertaste it improves. Oligofructose is also a prebiotic stimulating the growth of bifidobacteria in particular.<br /><br />Food Sources<br />FOS is extracted from fruits and vegetables like bananas, onions, chicory root, garlic, asparagus, barley, wheat, and tomatoes. The Jerusalem Artichoke has been found to have one of the highest concentrations of FOS. (In the case of Chocoperfection, the oligofructose is extracted from chicory root.)<br /><br />Health Benefits<br />FOS has been a popular dietary supplement in Japan for many years and is now becoming increasingly popular in Western cultures for its prebiotic effects. FOS serves as "fast food" for the probiotic beneficial or "friendly" bacteria that naturally populate the gut, increasing their ability to benefit overall Gastrointestinal Tract (GI Tract) health, especially proper digestion. It has also been touted as a supplement for preventing yeast infections.<br /><br />And this from Steggall Nutrition:<br /><br />Oligofructose is a tremendous substrate for bifidus bacteria, stimulating its activity by several hundred percent. This is called prebiotic activity, referring to stimulation of health promoting bacteria in the intestinal tract. Short chain fatty acids are produced, lowering pH levels and providing an energy source for the growth and maintenance of large intestine cells. This process leads to differentiation of cancer cells, a vital step that is required before cancer cells can be killed.<br /><br />The ideal environment for healthy bacteria is quite different to the environment preferred by pathogens and gram negative putrefactive bacteria. Consequently the undesirable bacteria diminish in number as the healthy bacteria proliferate in the presence of oligofructose.

review/summary: Good Chocolate Without Sugar, Sucralose or Maltitol
review/text: It is almost impossible to find chocolate that is low carb, and doesn't contain sucralose or malitol.  This candy is completely unique in that the sweetener is erythritol - no carbs, no toxic artificial junk, no sickening malitol.  I can eat these without raising my blood sugar or making my tummy complain violently.  That is the good part.<br /><br />Here are the negatives:  My family likes them, too, and I cannot make a box last long around my house - and these ARE NOT CHEAP!  That is why I gave it only 4 stars - I think the people who make these bars are raking in an obsene profit because they can - this product is one of a kind - No Competition and so the price is sky high.  I don't think the chocolate is any better quality than comparable chocolate bars for half the price or less, but this company has inflated the cost of ChocoPerfection to indecent levels because they have the market cornered on a specialty product.  Not uncommon, but kind of unfair to their customers.<br /><br />All the same, treats like this are so rare in my low carb, diabetic world, that I will buy these anyway.  And I will watch the pantry like a hawk to keep my non diabetic kin-folk out of the goodies!

review/text: I was hoping this would be good and really wanted to like it... was kind of like eating wax... I prefer a more bitter and deeper chocolate flavor.  I enjoy the taste of dark chocolate.  This bar seemed to be trying to mask the flavor of chocolate so much that there was nothing left.  sadly disapointed.  I like some of other sugar free chocolates, while more bitter, they are better.

review/summary: Not fabulous but gets the job done. ..
review/text: Think its wonderful that there is such a product for diabetics. Unfortunately the flavor is definitely not equivalent to very good milk or dark chocolate (ie Godiva, Dove etc). It nice that there is something available for those who can't eat regular chocolate. I bought the 5 pack from Chocoperfection website ($21 for 5 bars, free shipping). It came quickly, well packaged, fresh, not melted, good communication via email. Unfortunately the milk chocolate flavor is reminiscent of cheap "chocolate" (think inexpensive chocolate flavored Easter bunnies or dollar store "chocolate"). Someone in another review had mentioned this, and I do agree. Cheap chocolate flavor is not necessarily a bad thing. My husband likes that flavor. Keep in mind my perspective is from someone who typically eats the real deal, your mileage may vary especially if you haven't had the real deal in a while. The raspberry dark chocolate flavor and mint dark (received a mini sample of that one) tastes better than the milk and plain dark in my opinion.<br />There is also a product called "DeMets sugar free turtles", available in Walgreens and Walmart, $2.00 a bag. They are also made with Erythritol (like Chocoperfection) instead of the usual suspects of malitol (that's in the Russelstover sugar free stuff) that cause GI issues. Can't tell there is no sugar in the Demets and no upset.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: I first ordered the Dark Chocolate bars and found them to be very good for a sugar free product.  They have a very smooth mouth feel and good deep flavor.  I usually like Milk Chocolates so the darker chocolate is not what I am used to.  I am going to experiment with mixing with the milk chocolate bars and using to coat nuts and in other baked goods.<br /><br />I recently received the mixed sampler which also included the Milk Chocolate, Almond, and Raspberry.  I love the raspberry.  It has the wonderful flavor of raspberry liqueur and makes the dark chocolate sing.  This is the one I will reorder the most.  My second favorite is the almond.<br /><br />The milk chocolate was pretty good...different from a good full sugar chocolate and it did NOT taste like cheap Palmers to me. Note: Before I went Low-Carb I had stopped buying American Nestle products because they tasted like the cheap Palmers stuff.<br /><br />I have not experienced any noticable gassy effects.  The chocolate is very filling and satisfies my sweet tooth with a small amount.  As I said I am looking forward to experimenting with this product in the kitchen.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Almost too good to be true!!
review/text: I read most of the reviews - I've been debating on whether to buy something less expensive, however I remember like most items that I purchase "sometimes you get what you pay for".  I'm a chocolate lover, but dark chocolate is my favorite and these bars are AMAZING!!!  Unless you are just really trying to tell the difference, it's like eating the Hershey's "Special Dark".  I am blown away that these are only 2 net grams of carbs, which is the main reason I purchased these because I'm trying to watch my carb intake.  And the fact that these are naturally Sugar Free and Gluten-Free is almost too good to be true!  I would have never known the difference if someone handed me this chocolate bar.  It's truly THAT good!  My only negative review would be the price is overly expensive no matter HOW good they are (I paid $4.24 each bar when you include the price for shipping - I purchased 24 bars).  But if you're searching for quality and something that tastes like the real thing, these are worth the try!

They left me feeling totally satisfied and not craving more sweet foods.  I live in the town that creates these bars and was hoping I could get them cheaper directly from the company.....no such luck.  The only drawback to these bars is the cost.  As must as I'd love to eat one or half of one daily, I simply cannot afford it.  Despite the cost, I will continue to purchase these and eat them here and there.  If you're looking for a delicious guilt free treat, this is most definitely it!

review/summary: Awful chocolate to a gourmet chocoholic
review/text: I am a serious chcoholic (preferably dark), and have been buying lots of high end bars for years (Vosges, Michel Richart, La Maison du Chocolat, Venchi, etc.).  I cannot stand Hershey's, even their more upscale bars, and can barely tolerate Ghirardelli; Lindt is acceptable if nothing else were available.<br /><br />Vosges makes two sugar free bars, Barcelona and Red Fire; the Barcelona is "deep milk" (I prefer more like 65-70%) and the Red Fire is too hot for me. So I have been buying and trying all the other sugarless chocolate bars I can find. I have trouble eating any of the sugarless chocolate bars Amazon sells. I'll keep looking for high end sugar free chocolate bars, but meanwhile I'm sticking with the two Vosges.

review/summary: STAY AWAY - WILL RAISE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR - NOT GOOD FOR LOW CARB OR DIABETICS
review/text: So I had been looking around for someone diabetic who could post their sugars after eating a Chocoperfection bar, since the company makes so many zero glycemic index claims. I'm not diabetic, so I figured my results wouldn't help anyone. Well, after not finding anyone who had done this experiment, I just figured I'd give it a shot. I'm not diabetic, and I'd imagine if you were, your results would be way higher.<br /><br />I took my blood sugar at the 00:00 mark, and the ate the bar. Then I took my blood sugar again once every 10 minutes for an hour.<br /><br />00:00 75<br />00:10 73<br />00:20 82<br />00:30 83<br />00:40 83<br />00:50 91<br />00:60 93<br /><br />For me, almost 20 points difference in an hour, is major. I won't be eating them. I could eat a bag of skittles for the same glycemic cost. I don't know if it is the glycemic index, or the insulin response, or the leptin response that causes this fluctuation, I just know I don't need it.

review/text: I ordered the vanilla-flavored fortune cookies. First of all, they arrived double boxed with packing around the inner box. Both boxes were very sturdy cardboard and I have not found ANY broken cookies.<br /><br />The cookies taste fresh, slightly vanilly (my only wish would be a bit more vanilla flavor) but still tasty.  Serving size is noted as six cookies for a total of 110 calories so this makes a nice low calorie snack.<br /><br />I repacked the cookies when I got them into gallon size zip lock bags and was able to totally fill eight of them - lots of cookies. One DISCREPANCY - the above description reads "400 cookies" but the box these were received in reads "350 cookies."<br /><br />The fortunes themselves are clearly printed in English on one side and on the other side there are different Chinese words to learn with the Chinese written character and then the pronunciation in English. Also on that same side are a set of "lucky" numbers.<br /><br />All in all, a great buy!

review/text: These arrived quickly and were quite fresh. The individually wrapped fortune cookies were well sealed - each baggie around the cookie was full of air, protecting the cookie and its uniformity. Maybe i'm going into a little too much detail here, but the jiist is - there weren't any broken cookies. The citrus flavor is faint, but pleasant. While I do think the standard vanilla cookie tastes better, it's a welcomed flair. Be forewarned, these cookies just show up in one big box (see picture) with the cookies loosely packed, so make sure you've got a storage space for the bulk, and a tray/dish for a dozen or so you'll want to keep in the pantry.

The citrus ones taste just like the ones you get in the restaurants. They are slightly smaller, but not a big deal. Ours are fresh and not broken. This was a really great price for this many cookies!

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: These are the best fortune cookies I've ever eaten.  I would say less than 1% came broken and they were certainly NOT stale.  I liked them so much I've ordered another box!

review/text: Loved these! I ordered them for part of my wedding favors, and I was so happy when I got them. They are a little smaller then most fortune cookies but in a way it worked out better cause they fit nicely in the smaller chinese take out containers I used! I of course had to taste test them and I LOVE them! Hopefully I wont eat them all before my wedding!!!

review/text: When we first received these fortune cookies, it seemed that all would be well.  However, trying them the second day they were soft and had lost the crispiness.  No one wants any more so they'll probably go out at Halloween!

review/summary: They say too much of something is bad, but wow...
review/text: I can't believe the deal you get here.  I just went to the local Chinese Restaurant and I think we paid 3.00 dollars for like 9 fortune cookies.  Here you get 350-count for 32.00 with free shipping.  Very good deal.  They are also the same exact ones at the Chinese Restaurant so I am happy they aren't some knockoff brand, they taste awesome.  But when you buy things in bulk, sometimes it gets old and I think it will get like that with these, so I think I am going to only eat one or two a day, or until I feel they are getting stale.  Awesome cookies for the price though!

review/summary: Best priced fortune cookies around
review/text: These were the best priced fortune cookies I could find anywhere. Maybe 25-30 of them came cracked, but since there were 400 in the box, there were plenty of good ones left. I was a little hesitant to order because it said citrus flavor, but they tasted pretty close to normal fortune cookies to me. We used them for a project... softened them by heating in the microwave and then quickly opened them up and inserted our own fortunes inside... Took a long time but a fun project for kids to help with. We had lots left over, and I was glad that they were individually wrapped.

review/text: I was surprised that the cookies came unprotected just in a large box, but also surprised at how few were broken. The wrappers must provide good enough cushioning. But there was more cookies than we needed, but it was a great deal and definitely delicious!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I07O10">Golden Bowl Fortune Cookies, Vanilla Flavor, 350-Count Box</a><br /><br />I couldn't believe how great this deal was- nearly too good to be true.  The price was crazy good and the product was delivered beautifully.  The cookies taste great and out of the entire order, which consisted of two boxes, or seven hundred cookies, only ten were broken.  I'll order these again and again.  This is a deal that can't be beat!

review/summary: Exquisite
review/text: Exactly like the name says, this is a medium roast coffee. I ordered this because of a great price, but I only ordered one as I wasn't sure how it would taste. We just brewed some up in our Keurig, and it is fresh and rich. Very good taste for those who like a medium roast. One of the best coffees I've tasted so far and it's a bonus that this is fair trade (two thumbs up) and organic (two thumbs up). Recommended.

review/summary: Big Bold Taste Yet Mild
review/text: I like to drink my coffee with Half & Half and a sugar substitute; with that, I find this particular coffee rich, bold and full bodied yet smooth, without an offensive after taste that bites back. This is similar to Van Houtte Costa Rica Tarrazu light roast; but slightly stronger. Both I could drink all day long. I don't like a coffees who's after taste last with you for long periods of time; but yet, is very favorable. If you like V.H Costa Rica Tarrazu, give this one a try.<br /><br />This winner gets a spot in my top five favorites list. Which is not an easy achievement.

review/text: This version of Van Houtte coffee I did not care for. For a medium roast, I thought it to be a little strong and bitter. Their House Blend is much better.

review/text: We were very pleased with this coffee.  It was rich without being bitter.  We do not care for dark roasts because of the burnt taste and bitterness.  The price on these was excellent and we would definately buy again.
