review/text: I've been buying this brand of vinegar for probably 20 years now. Used to buy it at a local health food store, now I usually shop online. I use it on my salads. First I use olive oil then the vinegar. My family loves my salads. Wonderful product.. No complaints.

review/summary: Good for skin, bad on tummy
review/text: When I took this product, my skin cleared up a lot but I soon began to have digestive problems.  I probably need to play with how much water to dilute it in.  That said, it works for many people as a health drink, just make sure to watch the dosage if you have a sensitive stomach.

review/summary: Best Cider Vinegar I've found!
review/text: I make organic mustard from my home for sale at farmers market and local venues, and this vinegar is the KEY ingredient that makes it so good!  I've tried the supermarket/filtered cider vinegar, but it was found wanting.  I have tasted both, by the spoon, and side-by-side, there is NO comparison.  This stuff ROCKS!!!

review/text: Vinegar is an acquired taste so not everyone will enjoy drinking this straight or with water--although almost everyone will like it on salads.  Add a Tablespoon to homemade dough to give your bread some of the taste and benefits of sourdough.<br /><br />I fell in love with this vinegar as soon as I opened the bottle.  It smells like real apple cider vinegar and the taste is wonderful.  I'll never be able to use commercial "dead" vinegar again.

review/summary: Starting again today and these reviews...
review/text: I started the ACV drink a couple years ago, but never stayed regular with it because of the straight taste/smell.  Yeah, I know I KNOW...add some honey, sugar, blah blah blah...but I just got too lazy.  I told my SIL about it and she has been taking it regularly since because it keeps her healthy, where as before she was always getting sick with something nasty.<br />But since I started working a 8 hour desk job 2 months ago, my weight is slowly creeping up, even with working out 3 times/week and being fairly healthy in my eating.  So I am giving this ACV a try in addition to all the other stuff I am doing to see if my love handles will stop loving me so much.<br />However, I have been reading these Amazon reviews and they all sound the same (This stuff cured my dandruff; my face is clearer; heartburn is gone, I no longer spit out fire like a Shanghi dragon; my pants are fitting better; I took it to the middle east and now there is peace there).  Seriously, they all sound the same.  Not only that, the grammer is the same.  I have read enough Amazon reviews to know there are alot of people tht r just too lazy or dumm to rite sentences that are at least acceptable on a third grade level.  All the positive reviews have the same good grammer, enthusiasm about the product, and some Heinz bashing as well.  I just hope it's all true and it's not some scheme by Braggs to boost their reputation.<br />So why 3 stars from me?  The first star is for my SIL who claims it keeps her healthy, and she is a hypochondriac.  The second star is because I actually like ACV on my food...I just don't like it straight.  The third star is because I did drink it today with lots of water and it didn't taste as bad as I remembered it.  It tastes like distilled purified water that came from a sewage plant in Bangladash. I know my review is confusing because I say I do like ACV on food, but then I get images of Deepak Chopra's childhood neighborhood when I drink it.<br />With all that said, I promise to drink it every day for the 3 weeks starting Monday.  Why Monday?  Because this Sunday is superbowl and I plan on drinking lots of alcohol.  I will also update at the end of the 3 weeks and let you know if my love handles have dumped me.<br />****UPDATE****<br />February 23, 2012<br /><br />I have been taking the ACV regularly now since my first review (3 weeks ago) and I must admit, I actually enjoy drinking this now when I mix it with water, lemon juice, and honey/any kind of sweetener and it tastes like a powerful lemonade or virgin sour.  Just mix and sip on it while working.  It's actually really good.  I do, however just man up in the morning and take 1 tablespoon of it mixed with 1/2 cup water and let that run through me before breakfast.  I also do it in the afternoon when the after-lunch coma starts to hit me.  It really does perk me up and gives me that 'warming' feeling...like a nice shot of whiskey on an empty stomach.<br />The main reason I started doing this was to lose a few pounds.  I have not lost any weight, but I will tell you this: it kills my food cravings.  If any of you have worked a desk job, you know the inactivity and the mindless snacking can wreck havoc on your waist line.  When I mix my drink (2-3 tbs ACV, 2-3 tbs lemon juice, sweetener, 16 ounces of water) I have no desire to snack, even if someone does offer me a fresh chocolate glazed Krispy Kreme donut.  I am serious.  Someone did and all I did was dip my finger in the glaze for a taste, and threw the rest out.  I was smart to throw it out in a trash can else where because I am not above digging it back out for a bite.  Still, I am pretty sure my ACV would have prevented that pathetic move.<br />One other thing:  Some people have mentioned using this as a toner.  BE SURE TO WATER IT DOWN BEFORE PUTTING IT ON YOUR FACE.  I used it on my skin without diluting it and it caused these little blisters on my chin and around my lips.  I looked like meth addict with herpes.<br />I bumped my review to 4 stars because it helps with my food cravings and I like the drink concoction I created.  If I had lost some weight, I would bump it to 5 stars.  So we'll see.  I'll post again at the end of March.  Wish me luck...

I got it and tried it and it does not work that well at all. I used it to get rid of gnats and i waited for 3 weeks and nothing until the 4th week I got 2 finally so this product sucks. The advice i give you if you have gnats, kill them with your hand or fly swatter when you see them. It works very well with me. Gnats and flies will come in whenever they want and there is really nothing you can do about it. Let's face it, they are nasty bugs that fly around and bug the tar out of you we both know that. The second you kill them, you will eventually find more the second you turn around so get over it. Just give up and kill them yourselves. that theory works fantastic for me and i have not seen any more in my house until i open the door. Good luck.

review/summary: Burning, Nasty Taste, Couldn't Get It Down
review/text: I can't comment on my experience with Bragg's ACV health benefits because I couldn't get enough of it down.<br /><br />I like eating spicy and tart things like whole lemons, but this was a whole other level. I tried to put it in a drink and it burned my throat too much to get more than a quarter of the drink down. My mom tried mixing it in a drink because it's supposed to help with menopause and she couldn't get it down either. She said it tasted horrible. So bad that even though she was suffering quite a bit with menopause, she couldn't finish drinking it. The only way I could use it at all was as a light dressing on a salad, but there are much better tasting options.<br /><br />Given the low price and all of the health claims I'm glad I tried it, but ultimately I had no luck.

I have been using this stuff for nearly 2 Weeks, and the only thing about me that hasn't improved is my tax bracket.  Get some, try it. Be like the old Nike ad and "just do it". If it does nothing for you umm perhaps you're uhhh cursed? No science to substantiate that either, but check your palms and scalp for three 6's.

review/summary: An eight month experiment that changed my life
review/text: I have taken Braggs ACV for eight straight months. That's right, I've religiously taken 1-2 tablespoons 2-3 times per day for 250 days. I'd like to share my personal experiences and the changes my body has gone through since I started last October.<br /><br />At the outset of my ACV "diet" I was a pretty healthy 6'2" 210 pound 29 year-old guy with a decent spare tire around my waist. I was enjoying life a little too much and exercising too little. I started taking ACV for heartburn. I enjoy cooking so I had a bottle of it in my kitchen already. After experiencing the instant and amazing relief (and energy boost), I did a bit of research and found out that it cures a laundry list of other ailments. It sounded too good to be true, so my skeptical self decided to give it the old college try for a month. I continued taking it and noticed within days that I was sleeping better, eating better and generally had more energy. After a few weeks, my wife noticed that I had lost weight, and I shocked myself one day when I caught myself in a full-length mirror. I was getting my skinny college body back! And this without any exercise or apparent change in diet. I was doing nothing different except for the addition of ACV to my diet.<br /><br />Energy levels. This is the first thing you'll notice as the ACV hits your stomach. Almost instantly, you get a natural boost that lasts for hours. Any desire to eat unhealthy food fades. I've read that this is a result of the normalizing effect it has on blood sugar. This is also related to the weight loss people experience while taking it. The high energy levels given by ACV is my new normal.<br /><br />Addiction. Before taking ACV, I was drinking far too much alcohol and caffeine. A pot of coffee was my mainstay during the day and a bottle of wine was easy to finish after dinner. A few years ago I was getting heart palpitations from drinking too much caffeine so I quit cold turkey, but my usage was creeping back up again. Fast forward to after eight months on Braggs--I drink one glass of coffee per day (maybe two) and am lucky if I can finish a bottle of wine or a few heavy beers. My stomach just says ENOUGH. Oh, and no heart palpitations since!<br /><br />Sleep. I was a sleepwalker as a child. I never grew out of it. As an adult, I still sleepwalk and in addition suffer from insomnia and sleep paralysis (where you wake up, can't move and believe something is in the room with you--not fun). Before ACV I'd get sleep paralysis a few times per week and sleepwalk a few times per month. I needed 9-10 hours of sleep per night to feel rested. After ACV I fall asleep easier, RARELY get sleep paralysis and don't sleepwalk anymore. I wake up feeling refreshed after 7-8 hours.<br /><br />Weight loss. While not a magical fat-burning elixir, it will control your blood sugar and cravings, resulting in a slow weight loss over time. My "spare tire" is nearly gone and some of my pants are looking big on me. I'm continuing to lose weight slowly, and family and friends who only see me a few times per year always remark how thin I'm getting. ACV also gets rid of water bloat, which will have the visual effect of weight loss right away. Take it before going out to Macaroni Grill to prevent feeling like a lumbering dinosaur afterwards. Now that the weather is warmer I've started jogging and this magnifies the weight loss even more, and a shot beforehand always ensures a great workout with high energy levels.<br /><br />Skin. I never had a problem with acne before so I can't comment on its use for that. I did break out with some psoriasis on my nose recently, and I thought it was just dry skin. But it didn't go away after a month and was getting worse. I applied ACV directly with a Q-tip for a couple weeks and PRESTO it was gone. Amazing!<br /><br />Digestion. If you suffer from heart burn or acid reflux (I had both!) ACV works wonders. It also calms the stomach after a large meal and eliminates bloating and hangovers. It acts as a "cleanser" of sorts, so don't stray too far from the bathroom the first few times you take it. You'll be amazed at what comes out. On second thought, no you won't. Just flush.<br /><br />Immune system. I had a pretty strong one before starting the Braggs diet, however I still found myself getting sick a couple times per year, whether it was something nasty like the flu, a sinus infection or simply a cold brought on by stress. Guess what? I haven't been sick in eight months. Not even a sniffle. If I ever get sick again, I will be surprised.<br /><br />Here are a couple pointers. If you can't stand the taste, mix it with honey or juice. Or just man up and shoot it like a tequila shot (after awhile you'll get used to it). Now I simply drink it straight and instantly chase it with a big glass of water. I shoot it back so it doesn't touch my teeth and swish my mouth with the water. If you do it right it doesn't burn. Just think of it as really tart apple cider. If you're going to wuss out of taking ACV because of the taste, you're doing yourself a disservice and missing out on a lot of health benefits.<br /><br />Apple cider vinegar does AMAZING things to every bodily system. I don't know how it works, but it works. I was a believer after days and will remain one for years. Now I know why doctors and the medical establishment scoff at ACV--if everyone took it they'd be out of a job! Do your body a favor and start your own Braggs experiment!

review/summary: 14 days so far! I've done a lot of online research.
review/text: I am 34 year-old male who had terrible side effects (severe constipation) from statins while trying to reduce my cholesterol of 234. I had to quit taking them. A friend at work recommended 2 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar with some juice every day. She said her results shocked her doctor after 2 months. She also said it worked for her sister.<br /><br />So, I tried it that night, and also wanted to check it out online, because I'm always a skeptic. What I found was that a LOT of people recommend ACV for a whole range of things that interest me. After reading all I've read, and from my personal experience so far, I'm really diggin it. The only side effects I've seen is the taste, and because it is very acidic, people say you should keep it off your teeth as much as possible.<br /><br />Here's a list of some of the things I've read that it helps dramatically with:<br />Cholesterol, blood pressure, immune system, detoxification, eczema, migraines, headaches & sinus headaches, hair thinning & hair loss, warts, slow steady weight loss, diabetes, depression, insomnia, increased energy & alertness, infections & cancers, the flu, sinus infections & post nasal drips, allergies & asthma, chronic fatigue, sore throats, arthritis, ulcers, bowel problems & IBS, nail fungus, acne, skin problems & complexion. The list goes on and on, to the point where it sounds WAY too good to be true.<br /><br />I read several testimonials from teachers and nurses that used to get sick repeatedly, to the point where they thought they'd have to quit their jobs, until they started taking ACV. They claim they don't get sick anymore at all.<br /><br />Since there really doesn't seem to be any side effects from ACV, I can't think of any reason NOT to try Apple Cider Vinegar. I am curious/anxious to see if it helps with some of my stuff. In particular, I get sick. A LOT. I work in retail and I usually need antibiotics at least 4 times each winter for sinus infections, sore throats and post nasal drips, going back to when I was a kid. Allergies. Cholesterol. More energy and some weight-loss sounds good too! Basically, it seems to clean out your blood and detoxify your body really well, which helps to get the whole machine running like it should.<br /><br />I've only been on it for 14 days as of this writing, and what I can testify about so far is:<br />1. Energy/Alertness. I feel really good so far. Many users claim they feel a very persistent boost of energy within a day, and I certainly felt it too, and it hasn't stopped. I've also been sleeping very well. For at least 10 years, (since about when I had mono) I have always felt like I was in a bit of a brain fog. (No jokes please!) Since taking it these past two weeks, I feel very alert with increased energy. It just FEELS like my body and brain are simply "on their game", so to speak.<br />2. Allergies. When I started taking the ACV, my allergies were already bothering me for a bit, and I've been clear as a bell since the first day. Also, every time I go to my in-laws, my allergies go nuts from their dog. I usually have to start popping Benadryl within a half an hour. This past week, I was there for 2 nights and 3 days and didn't even need 1 pill. My sinuses were totally clear! Was it the ACV? Other people said they had similar quick findings, but I don't want to say for sure. Ragweed season is right around the corner, so we'll see how it handles that.<br />3. Complexion. ACV supposedly helps clear it up in a slow but steady fashion. My face was breaking out really bad for the past month when my cholesterol pills screwed up my whole system. In addition, I have always had many blackheads on my nose area, no matter what I washed it with. I poured a little bit of ACV on some paper towel and rubbed the area with it like a Stridex Pad, and within 2 days my facial complexion looks better than it has in years. I've never gotten results like this! Again, is it the ACV? I can't say for sure. It could just be that my body is happy I've stopped doing what I HAD been doing. Watch... I'll probably wake up with a big 'ol zit tomorrow morning!<br /><br />In general, it just feels like I am being detoxed, and natural remedies like this are up my alley. If it helps with just 1 or 2 of these things, with no side effects like my pills gave me- I'll keep at it for a while. I don't want to go around running my mouth until I am positive it is seriously working, but I wouldn't mind hearing if it is working for other people too. So let me know if you try it and what you find, and I'll continue to do the same... I'm a bit of a closet scientist who loves to discuss his data!<br /><br />The only other things I take daily are a Men's One-a-Day vitamin, Activia (yogurt), Claritin (allergy pill), and a fish oil pill (also good for cholesterol & heart health). I've been taking 2 tablespoons of the ACV mixed with very little water, like a shot, and then I chase it with more water. The bad taste is over in less than 5 seconds- No sweat!<br /><br />One thing I've read over and over again, is to NOT buy the regular ACV you find in the store. People say that it has been distilled and filtered to make it look more clear- but that just takes out all the nutrients and potency. They say to look for "organic" or "raw" from a health store or farm stand, and it is just as cheap. They say that the cloudier it looks, the better.<br /><br />Just Google "apple cider vinegar" and you'll quickly find hundreds of user testimonials and advice from around the world, from all types of people. I was skeptical at first, but you have to ask yourself... "Could ALL these people be morons?" Or, "Why would they all lie about a 3 dollar bottle that they aren't making any money from?"<br /><br />There doesn't seem to be much to lose. If it stops working, I'll stop drinking! I'll write another review after my cholesterol check-up within 2 months, and probably another after I see how it does with colds this winter! Good health!!

review/summary: cures dandruff
review/text: I became interested in ACV when a coworker mentioned it as an effective weight loss aid.  While doing some online research, I read that it can be beneficial for scalp conditions.  Over the past few weeks, my scalp has started itching and flaking like crazy--to the point of insanity.  I was scratching so much that I left scabs, and I've hated the way it looks.  I have chocolate brown hair so the flakes are very obvious.  Prescription shampoo (Nizoral) helped some but didn't completely cure it.<br /><br />So I tried some undiluted ACV as a post-shampoo hair rinse--and it worked great!  I've used it three times now, and dandruff is about 98% gone.  The itching has COMPLETELY cleared up.  I couldn't be happier. My method is: Pantene shampoo, rinse, full-strength ACV, rinse.  My hair is super soft and shiny afterwards.  I read that some folks dilute the ACV first, others use ACV as a shampoo (supposedly works well for oily hair), and others don't rinse the ACV out of their hair at all.  Users will probably want to experiment to find out whats going to work best for them.<br /><br />The only drawbacks:  If you have any tender areas (cuts, scraps, scabs) the ACV burns a bit.  If you get any ACV in your eyes, the ACV burns a LOT.  The smell is horrible but it disappears when your hair dries.  Be sure your hair is dry before you leave for a hot date or meet with wealthy clients, because the smell will be noticible until your hair dries.<br /><br />I've experimented with taking ACV orally as well to get the health benefits and possible weight loss benefits.  The problem with this is that ACV tastes TERRIBLE, even stirred into a glass of water, even with a spoonful of honey.  Seriously, its terrible.  It smells like that brown vinegar that British people put on fried fish, so it probably tastes similar.  I wasn't expecting this, so I was disapointed.  I guess I thought I would like ACV because I adore red wine vinegar and use it often on salads and sandwiches, but ACV is nothing like red wine vinegar.  I can't stress enough how bad it tastes, and I'm not a picky eater at all--I like pretty much everything...hence the weight problem.<br /><br />I have discovered that I can tolerate a tablespoon of ACV in an 8 oz glass of grape juice.  I've always loved Welch's Concord grape so this is what I use.  I did not care for ACV in a glass of orange juice, however.  Its tolerable but grape juice masks the taste of ACV better.  For all I know, the grape juice is interfering with the ACV absorption, or killing the ACV nutrients, or whatever.  But this is the only way (so far) I can get it down.<br /><br />The good news is that my grape ACV cocktail has a slight appetite-suppressive effect.  Its subtle, but I do fill up a little faster if I drink it just before a meal.  Since there are calories in a glass of grape juice, I may or may not be getting any weight-loss benefits.  Time will tell.  Drinking it provides lots of other health benefits, so even if I don't lose weight my efforts won't be wasted.<br /><br />I got mine at my local GNC store, where I paid $5.99 for my 32 oz bottle.  Looks like I paid just a little more than if I gotten it from Amazon.  Thats ok though, it was worth every penny.  I will keep using it, so I'll be watching for sales online and in stores.<br /><br />Bottom line:  ACV is a great product for dandruff sufferers.  The jury is still out on using for weight control.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Drinking the ACV began to irritate my mouth and throat, so I stopped after a week or two.  However, I'm still finding it useful for dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis) control.  The dandruff problem will sometimes suddenly flare up, and ACV rinses are useful during these times.  I've recently read that masks of warm olive oil are also helpful for this problem, and I tried it today with great results.  The itching subsided almost completely.  I think it'll be useful in the future to use warm olive oil scalp masks once after every few days of ACV rinses because the ACV is quite drying.  Olive oil restores softness and shine along with killing the itch.  Wash the oil out in your kitchen sink to keep your tub from getting oily.  Good luck, fellow dandruff sufferers.

review/summary: A delicious and salubrious treat!
review/text: This is the best tasting apple cider vinegar I have ever tried and I've tried quite a few brands but nothing compares to Bragg's cider vinegar. There is an almost 'malted' flavor with hints of sweet/tart apples and no 'bitter' aftertaste. Be sure to shake the bottle up each time before using [it will froth up a bit when you do] because that incorporates all the little sediments of the 'mother' that settle to the bottom.<br /><br />Yes, it's a bit 'spendy' but so worth it! I even add one tablespoon of Bragg's apple cider vinegar to my pitcher lemonade to give it an extra 'zing'.<br /><br />If you want an energy/immune-system super boost, mix one teaspoon raw apple cider vinegar with one tablespoon raw honey, [check out HoneyPacifica] for the best truly raw cold packed honey on earth] 1/2 teaspoon raw coconut oil [Aloha Nu is one of the best], 2 drops of propolis tincture, 1/2 teaspoon of fresh royal jelly and 2 tablespoons of good quality plain yogurt (my personal favorite is Mountain High brand yogurt).<br /><br />To your health!

review/summary: Apple Cider Vinegar by Bragg
review/text: What's not to love?  It's apple cider vinegar!  Great for cooking but I use it for other purposes as well.  For example, my 9-year-old gets the occasional wart on her hands.  Not sure if it is the placebo effect or if this stuff is really magic, but I put a little piece of cotton soaked in it on the wart, cover with a bandaid and leave it on overnight.  Two nights of treatment and the wart usually turns black and falls off within a week,  Friends have had similar success with warts the doctor couldn't even get rid of with multiple freezing.<br /><br />Gross, I know!  But hey, warts and all, right?<br /><br />I also use it as an astringent on my face and it has really helped clear up any breakouts I've had.  Like I said, it may be the placebo effect but if it works- it works!! And it is far cheaper than other remedies out there.<br /><br />Bragg's has a much better taste to me than the regular apple cider vinegars out there I've tried(for some reason, I feel like it smells better, too).  It does have more sediment in it than other brands so shake before using and it may not be optimal for household cleaning(I know my mom likes to use vinegar and water on her wood floors).  Love the stuff and can be used for many purposes!

review/text: Please don't waste your time taking the typical grocery-store brands like Heinz - you know, the vinegars that you would normally clean with.  When those types of vinegars are processed, they lose many of the health benefits that taking a swig or two of a good organic vinegar provides.  Taking a dose of a GOOD apple cider vinegar daily such as this brand will help get rid of the toxins as well as help fight certain illnesses.<br /><br />This Braggs Organic Apple Cider Vinegar tastes the best and it contains the MOTHER.  I use this on fried red cabbage, and daily on my salad I eat for lunch.<br /><br />Sometimes I even take a tablespoon straight out of the bottle.

review/summary: Completely Cured my Heartburn!!!
review/text: It is not common knowledge that the symptoms for too much stomach acid are pretty much the same as for too little acid. As such many people, like myself, start taking tums or rolaids or a purple pill. Stomach medicine is huge industry and once on these drugs to relieve symptoms you may find yourself becoming a lifelong user. Heartburn began becoming a problem for me a few years ago, late 40's, and got worse with fatty foods like beef or grilled cheese.... I had to take something after each meal to manage the belching and burning in my chest as the problem became chronic. I heard about ACV as a home cure and gave it a try. Voila!!! In a few minutes, after the burn of drinking some straight out of the bottle passed, I noticed my symptoms got noticeably better. I tried more, 2-3x day, and after a few days/weeks the problems disappeared completely. I then got off it and took it mostly on a need be basis, or sometimes before a heavy meal, so problems would randomly occur. Then I read books on the subject and realized the many other benefits and said to myself 'I should be taking this regularly' and did. Now I get heartburn barely once or twice a year and only in connection with some meals and this only happens when I am away from home on a trip and away from my ACV.<br /><br />This stuff is great and only cost pennies/serving. The taste is, well, it's vinegar, which is weak acetic acid. I generally pour a little, about a tablespoon or so, in a glass, add a little water, and down it like a shot - horrible to sip. Sometimes I do this before a big meal but often just a hit in the morning. This, along with Carlson's Cod Liver Oil, are now part of daily healthy living supplements - I have not been sick in years and I used to get sick 1 or 2x year for almost 50 years. If you are on stomach meds for heartburn, give this a try. It may or may not be the ticket but if your problem is too little acid then STOP taking things that kill your acid pump else you may be destined to a life of worrying about what you can or cannot eat. I love my heavy and spicy foods (not every day) and now they love me back.<br /><br />Also, you want the good stuff, this brand with the mother (shaken before each use), not filtered ACV from Heinz or similar brands - these may help with acid reflux symptoms but do not include all the beneficial nutrients/enzymes of the 'mother' which are pasteurized out of almost all modern foods. Diets these days do not include essential enzymes as they are killed off during pasteurization process. The modern lifestyle has us hunting for drinks, including ACV and juices  that are filtered and clear (clean looking), but your body wants what it needs to stay healthy and this is one of those things that costs almost nothing and should be part of your standard diet/lifestyle. They used to say, 'an apple a day helps keep the doctor away.' Apples (pectin) and ACV will help keep the doctor away. Health is achieved via lifestyle; diet, exercise, rest, NOT pills. Pills often come into the picture after one leads a unhealthy lifestyle.

You can add a cup to your bath to soften your skin.  You can mix two teaspoons of olive oil and teaspoon of Braggs to make an ant-aging moisturizer for your face,.  You can also apply this directly to your face via a cosmetic pad or cotton ball avoiding your eyes, like an astringent, leave it on for 10 minutes and rinse with warm water to remove dead skin cells on your face.  So cook with it, or beautify yourself.  I'd stick to the organic varieties.

review/summary: Heinz?  Never again!
review/text: If you're considering using Apple Cider Vinegar for health purposes, then it MUST be Bragg's!<br /><br />After researching ACV for about a week I decided on Bragg's Organic unfiltered with the "mother".  Simply type into any search engine "benefits of apple cider vinegar" and you can see for yourself.<br /><br />I tried Heinz while awaiting the delivery of Bragg's.  The "distilled" ACV has virtually ZERO nutrient/health benefit...so go ORGANIC :)<br /><br />Concotion 3x/day:<br />Mix 2 tablespoons of Bragg's ACV with 1/2 teaspoon baking soda.  Add to 8-12 oz of water.  Stir and drink.  It tastes like a very light champagne or ale.  I can already see the benefits from ACV.  Pants already fit better after one week. The "dark circles" under my eyes are almost cleared up and hemorrhoids are clear as well.  The most striking benefit is that I now have regular bowel movements.  Before I would go 2-4 days, so this product is definitely aiding in digestion!  Also, I haven't taken a Prilosec OTC or antacid in over a month.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Aids in digestion by helping breakdown of fat<br />*Helps remove dark circles underneath your eyes<br />*Good for varicose veins<br />*Proven to help with Acid Reflux (GERD)<br />*Help reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol<br />*Lowers blood pressure<br />*Cures hemorrhoids (from inside via drink, outside via applying to cotton ball)<br /><br />Cons:<br />*More expensive than "grocery store" ACV<br />*Not readily available at local rural supermarkets (leaving larger carbon footprint to have delivered to your home)<br /><br />Buy it by the GALLON if you're on the fence.  It will save you time and money.  1 quart was $5.68 ($22.72/gallon) v/s $14.99 for the gallon jug.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: GREAT for heartburn
review/text: Seems since I hit 40 I have also been hit with horrid GERD. Never had any problems before and could eat pretty much anything I wanted! Spicy, really spicy, chocolate, etc. Now if I eat those things I have heartburn constantly. I happen to LOVE spicy foods! I read where apple cider vinegar can really help with acid reflux, heartburn and GERD. I don't like to take any medications so I decided what the heck. Well, I can honestly say it does work! I take 1 TBS in a glass of water after every meal and voila! no more heartburn. It also seems to be helping with severe sinus issues I have. I swear I feel less congested. I buy my apple cider vinegar from trader joe's. It's organic & unfiltered and about $2.99 a bottle!

review/summary: Good for Skin and Reduces Food Cravings
review/text: After doing a bit of research, I decided to buy Braggs at my local organic food store.  I am in my 30s and I get sick almost every month (bronchitis, allergies, UTI, etc). I bought Bragg's ACV with a bottle of Braggs limeaide and these are my observations:<br /><br />1. Tastes and smells absolutely HORRIBLE.  At first I was drinking pure Braggs limeade but I couldn't stand the taste so I decided to buy a jar of orange honey and a bottle of pure ACV so I can mix it with the limeaide and dilute it with water.<br /><br />2. I honestly believe that every person's dosage is different and one should NOT take too much that your body can't handle.  I did some research and they say you can create damage to your stomach by taking too much.  It can also thin blood.  I took 1 tbsp 2x a day the first day but I had a massive headache and had tummy ache.  I decided to lessen the dosage to:<br />1-1.5 tsp of ACV<br />2 oz of bragg's limeaide<br />2 oz of distilled water<br />1 tsp of orange honey<br /><br />I only take this once a day during night time, I feel I don't need too much daily since I have a healthy weight and I'm only using it for prevention.<br />Well, the lesser dosage felt so much gentler on my tummy but I still have mini-headaches.  I don't know if this is a detox period, as it has been only 5 days but the headaches are tolerable and lasts an hour or two.<br /><br />3. Even if I only take this once a day, my food cravings have lessened 25-30%. I used to snack ALL DAY, I still snack once at night, but no longer have mid-day cravings.<br /><br />4. I guess it's too early to tell but I looked at my face in the mirror today and my face puffiness has lessened! I am not the best eater and take too much sodium so I suffer from face puffiness.  I also noticed that my overall facial skin is brighter than usual.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think if I stick to a safe and mild dosage, Bragg's will benefit my skin and reduce my cravings for unhealthy foods.  I do hope that the mini headaches will go away in time.  I will keep everyone updated about my progress after a week or two.<br /><br />I'm going to try and stick to the ACV diet and see

review/text: This stuff is truly a miracle.  My husband has had problems with his shoulder for years.  He regularly takes tramadol for pain, which makes him drowsy and not able to function.  He started on the ACV 10 days ago.  He has very minor shoulder pain now and has not taken a pain pill since he started.  He was able to put his arm on the pew in church yesterday, for the first time in many years.  He says his shoulder has only a minor ache, nothing like the severe pain he was suffering. He will continue on the ACV.

review/summary: Great preventive, nutraceutical
review/text: I didn't start out with any health problems when I began taking Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar several years ago, neither chronic nor acute problems--I almost never get flu or colds--so I can't report on any miracle cures. So why do I take 1 tablespoon every day? Because I consider it tremendous preventive nutrition. It has an anti-inflammatory effect, which is crucial for health, and it aids digestion. As we get older, our body's production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach decreases, and the acidity of Bragg helps with that problem.<br /><br />Personally, I love the taste of this wonderful vinegar in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014ET1S8">V8 low sodium vegetable juice</a>. Previously I had used lemon juice in my V8, but this is even better.<br /><br />Highly recommended1

review/summary: Bragg, good for gout
review/text: I just recently discovered I have gout and searched online for some form of home treatment and kept coming across Bragg with 'The Mother'. Being desperate, I was in excruciating pain sometimes and wanted to try anything. Most people online said within a couple days they noticed improvements, but for me it was about a week before I noticed that when I flex my toes the horrible pain didn't come. I have been drinking an 8oz glass 3 times a day with 2 teaspoons of this in it. It tasted horrible and smells even worse. I use a few drops of lemons or lemon juice to make it tolerable, also, put in ice and make it very cold and then take the ice out so it's not watered down, it being very cold helped too.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for a gout treatment I recommend this. I have yet to go to the doctor, but I will go, and I do think you need to go anyway even with this treatment. I also cut out red meat and bacon and I take alfalpha tablets 3 times a day because someone said that helped them online, but I can't tell if those are working. This totally took away the pain when I bend and flex my toes, but it did take about a week to notice results at 3 times a day. I will buy again and keep using. But you definitely need to find a way to get the stuff down but this works for me.

review/summary: Amazing, radical change for me.
review/text: Because others' reviews have helped me so much in ordering and utilizing this product, I owe it to them and to people interested to share my own experience with Bragg - Apple Cider Vinegar. It has helped me totally unexpectedly in many areas:<br /><br />1. After seeing countless positive reviews, I bought the product. However, I was so eager to try that I went to my supermarket and bought a raw, unfiltered, organic ACV to try it before my order would arrive. I had been feeling inexplicably weak, tired, achy, with bad a headache that was lasting: It felt like a flu, and I was really discouraged. Since I am on the Dukan diet, I thought maybe it was because I came to an exhaustion point, eating close to nothing and not losing anymore weight for a while. Alternating periods of starving and binging because even if you can eat how much you want on this diet, there is so much of the same food you feel like eating, and then you get so frustrated that you start accepting invitations and just jump on all the previously forbidden sweets, fatty stuff etc. Well, at least it has been my experience. To come back to our ACV, I got my bottle of another brand, got a shot (2 tbs in a glass of water) and MIRACULOUSLY, after maybe 15 to 30 seconds, I received like a kick, an amazing energy boost. My headache was gone, along with my overall fatigue, back pain and muscle ache (legs, arms, shoulders). It was close to bed time, so I went to sleep, and there I had an agitated night. I could feel that my body temperature (which is usually pretty low) had significantly raised. I woke up starving the next morning, and totally rested, with the ideal energy to start my day on the right foot. That was for the immediate effect, after taking only one serving.<br /><br />2. Day two, I decided to incorporate this into my diet, and since I am in a weight loss program, (lost 20lbs on the Dukan Diet between September 2011 and February 2012, but then because I wasn't able to keep it up seriously, I had alternated gain and loss of about 6.lbs from February to June) 2 weeks ago, I had decided to attack this diet seriously again, lost 6lbs the 3 days, and then (although eating less and less, and not feeling hungry at all) nothing at all for close to 2 weeks, even gaining some. Today is my 3rd day of incorporating this ACV ( 3 times a day in a large glass of water and sugar free peach syrup for the taste) and I have lost 6lbs, with more energy than ever, and eating way more than I used to. I feel hungry when I wake up and basically 2 hours after each meal, which is fine, because then I eat low calorie stuff, and it works.<br /><br />3. I have used it for several other stuff, all excited by this miraculous product:<br /><br />- Toner: I don't have skin problems or barely (other than it being extremely sensitive), and usually only clean my face with rose water on a cotton swab, morning and night. With Almond oil when I put make up on, which is not everyday. I used it pure first, and it was too strong for my skin. So I used it diluted,and it's about the same as using rose water for me, except for the smell: Rose water smells better.<br /><br />- On allergies. I suffer from eczema, and another form of it which is dishydrosis (an unbalance of water in the skin that makes bubbles, like when you just burned yourself, on hands and feet. It is itching, and quite tiring because your body never feels comfortable. It usually happens to me in the summer when it starts to get hot) I applied pure ACV. It considerably relieved the itching, and many bubbles had disappeared the next day. I'm very happy with this, because I hadn't found much helpful stuff other than cortisone lotions that I try to avoid as much as I can.<br /><br />- On hair: I have a short, colored and highlighted hair style. My hair is very thick. I used ACV in place of after shampoo, diluted ( 2 tbs in a 1liter bottle of water) Hair is softer, highlights shiner, BUT as I said, my hair is thick and I hardly ever manage to dry it completely. As long as your hair is wet, even a little, the smell of vinegar doesn't go away. at night, I found my hair a bit dryer than usual, and today it looks like I just washed it. I will keep using it for a while and see, but I'm not sure I like this dry feeling. Will keep you updated on that.<br /><br />- Mask with the Aztek Healing Green Clay: very powerful stuff that leaves your skin scarily RED after use for about 30-45 minutes. It's great, but I have been using French green clay with rosewater for years, so except for the spectacular reaction with the vinegar, I am not sure it's better. I guess I'll keep you updated on that too. I am 100% sure though that it's better than any expensive mask out there. I strongly advise for putting a strong sunscreen afterwards and make sure your skin is well hydrated before going out, even if it's not so sunny. It seems to really remove dead skin and therefore leaves your skin more vulnerable to UV attacks.<br /><br />One more comment I'd like to make is that although the first day I drunk it it removed my cigarette stains and dental plaque better than the Extra Whitening Crest, I would recommend as others have to drink with a straw and rinse your mouth after drinking because it does soften the enamel.<br /><br />In short, I feel healthier than ever, went for an hour walk today, my metabolism seems to be significantly boosted, I am losing weight and seems to have burned a plateau (in combination with my weight loss plan), my skin looks great, my eczema is very significantly reduced, and all this on the 3rd day of using it. I say not many products can claim to be that efficient, when being cheap and healthy!<br /><br />4. Today I received my Bragg - Apple Cider Vinegar. I was so eager to try it, and opened it right away. Drunk my portion, and OMG it tastes so good! No syrup needed anymore for me. It's 10 times better than the other brand I had. I drink it with even more pleasure.

review/summary: very good stuff
review/text: I was never all that fond of vinegar in my food or otherwise, but recently I was told that raw vinegar is a good health/dieatary supplement.  I have been taking it by mixing two tablespoons of vinegar with two tablespoons of honey or molasses, one teaspoon of spirulina with about 8 ounces of water.  In drinking the mixture with honey, it still has a mild pungent quality but is not hard to swallow like vinegar alone.  When using molasses with the mixture, virtually all of the pungent quality is taken away, but it's not nearly as sweet as the mixture with honey.  Although the honey is better tasting, I opt for the mixture with molasses since it's healthier.

review/summary: Too many things to name
review/text: I really don't know where to start. I rarely give reviews but I HAD TO for the Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar. This stuff is amazing. I was using it on my hair to get rid of the flaking and itching and it was wonderful for that. Last week, I was online looking for natural cures for PMS and I saw the Braggs ACV so I decided to give it a try. I haven't been using it long enough to give a review on the PMS but I can say that it has helped me with other things.<br /><br />1) My complexion. I took a few shots and the next morning I immediately noticed a difference with my skin. My face felt tighter. Some of my coworkers even noticed a difference in my face.<br />2) I am now regular. This stuff is like Drain-o for your body. I can literally feel this stuff moving around in my organs. I remember when Doctor Oz said your BM should come out like the letter "S" and the Braggs ACV will cause your BM to do this. I know this is TMI but this is very important to our health.<br />3) Cravings. This is going to sound weird but the Braggs ACV caused me to miss breakfast by accident. I ALWAYS eat breakfast but for some reason the morning after my first shot, I had no desire for it. I don't know what caused that. Also, it took away that exciting feeling I get when I snack. I tried to snack later in the day and I didn't have my usual exhilarating feeling. I don't understand how it took away that emotion????????? Now I want to eat fruits. My body is telling me to leave the junk alone and eat/drink more of this stuff!

Its about a dollar cheaper than the store but the shipping is seven dollars and its the exact same brand and everything. So if you can just get it at the store you will be saving money.

review/summary: THIS PRODUCT HAS CHANGED MY LIFE!!!!!!
review/text: I have been using Bragg's ACV for about 2 years now and all I can say is that it has changed my life. I used to be sluggish all the time, having that "cobweb in the brain" feeling every day. Since using the ACV I have incredible energy and stamina and sleep well at night as well! I have not been sick at all and my legs and knees feel the best they ever have. Ironically, I ran out of vinegar about two months ago and for some reason kept forgetting to pick up a new bottle. Two weeks went by and I started feeling awful again. I had forgotten how it felt to be off the vinegar and was returning to my sluggish ways. I bought some more and almost immediately felt great again!! I know it sounds crazy but you have to experience it for yourself. My cholseterol even dropped under 200 which it never has...my doctor was amazed! He said to keep doing what I am doing. I am a user for life - I absolutely love this product! As far as the taste is concerned, I put a teaspoon in a 4 ounce glass of water and drink 2 of them. It goes down so easily - I actually look forward to the taste!!!

review/text: This is only my second day using Braggs vinegar and I am impressed. I did an MRI the other day which the results came back saying I have 2 small ovarian cysts.  I googled natural remedies for ovarian cysts and a site came up with tons of women who said after taking organic vinegar for about a month and the follow up ultrasound came back with the cysts gone. [...] I came to Amazon, read every review then decided to purchase this. I plan on taking it for a month then following up on my cysts. In only 2 days I've seen a decrease in my appetite. Im wondering if its my mind playing tricks on me or if this is for real. Last night I wanted something sweet and had no desire for the chips ohoy chewy fudge in the cupboard. I ended up eating 2 nectarines and a banana. Just now I made sphagetti, pasta, and veggies for dinner and didnt have an urge for the pasta. This is amazing!!! I also went ahead and purchased the aztec cream since so many people had rave reviews about it. Indeed my pores look much smaller. Right about now I would be fatigued and passed out on the couch instead Im awake alert typing this review. The taste and smell is not the best but today was much easier than yeterday. I put 2tbs in an 8oz bottle of water in morning and evening then I ate something right after to get rid of the taste. I know its only been 2 days but this stuff is the truth!

review/summary: Excellent ACV - Worth it!
review/text: I have been using ACV for a long time and this one is by far the best tasting of any of them, especially the junk from the Supermarket (don't even bother). I have a 64 ounce jug of water that I drink from through-out the day with an equivalent of about 6 to 8 teaspoons of ACV. I used to use more Honey to sweeten but this doesn't need as much sweetener. I won't go over all the benefits. They are listed over and over here and from other sources. I wouldn't use it though if I wasn't convinced of the benefits.<br /><br />One thing that people should realize though about the usage. Taking a big shot at the start of the day will lesson the effects compared to consuming it through-out the day. Spreading it out all day evens out any PH spikes in your system. One big 'gulp' does taste bad, is very hard on your teeth (acidic), and goes through your system faster. Spread it out over the day. As a little pick me up I like to add a couple teaspoons to a glass of tomato juice or v8 when I get home from work to tie me over until supper.<br /><br />The taste?? I am starting to like it!!<br /><br />Good Luck and enjoy!

review/summary: Quality Product
review/text: I have used Braggs Amino for many years in cooking recipes in place of soy sauce. I prefer it. I just finished my first bottle of ACV. It is much higher quality that others and although strong it seems milder (to the taste) that other brands. To the person that did not get good results from using it and anyone else; I also followed the directions on the label, it did nothing, THEN I decided to try it with a sugar alternative (PureVia) instead of honey and it made a BIG difference. I feel better and get an energy boost. I am going to purchase the Braggzyme now.

review/summary: GOOD SKIN TIGHTNER!
review/text: I started out takin the ACV orally, but couldnt take the taste.... then i started adding it to my daily teaS... OMG!  it was delicious.... i dont remember why but i stopped but since i ran across this today im gonna start back :)<br />One other thing that i found astonshing... this is good as a skin tightner. i work out daily! I where  a waist cincher every day while i work out and a friend of mind advised me to try soaking my mid section with ACV the kind with the mother then put on my waist cincher. as strange as it may seem i did it and over a pd of time I did notice a tightning of the skin in my midsection. I also had really bad stretch marks on my stomach from pregnancy the marks are lighter as well. I can now wear my bikini and not be embarrased. (my youngest is 10 so the marks had been there for awhile) I thought maybe this was a fluke, so i tried it on something i knew had a lot of excess skin.... my thighs and buttock area. I did this every single day under my workout gear. I spray my waist, thighs , and buttocks then i put on my workout gear. I was amazed ,,, i could tell a significant difference in my skin. Dont get it twisted... this did not happen overnite but i did see a change in my skin.. i guess I did this for a month or longer before i noticed a difference.....<br />THis is awesome stuff... about to order more right now!

review/summary: Healed my Sciactic Nerve
review/text: I bought this product after reading the many positive reviews on here. I bought it because I read that it aided in weight loss (with diet and exercise) and gave great energy. Well I didn't experience the energy nor any change to my weight. However, it did help with my sciactic nerve. I developed this problem during my two pregnancies. My babies laid on the nerve in my lower back and butt and as a result I develop Sciactic nerve pain. Let me tell you, if you've never had it before you are blessed. Its so painful. I would literally be in tears. When I was pregnant with my last child I would lay in the bed and cry because my pain was so bad that I couldn't get up in the mornings. My son is five months now and up until two months ago I continued to have this pain. Then I ordered this apple cider vinegar and I felt relief quickly. I took 1 teaspoon in the morning (two was too strong for me), and the next morning the pain wasn't do bad. The second day, the pain was numb. The third day, the pain was gone! I was shocked and very skeptical so I stopped taking it to see if it was really the cause of my relief and sure enough the pain came back. So I went back to my 1 teaspoon every morning and my pain went away. I used a whole bottle (16oz), which I shared with my husband, and my pain is gone. I haven't bought anymore because I am now pain free. I believe this stuff works differently for everyone but its so worth a try. FYI, I never could drink this stuff in my water, even when adding the suggested honey. I tried to mix it with other drinks and gagged. Finally I took another reviewer 's advice and took it in one shot like I was taking cold medicine.  Its strong like pickle and lemon juice mixed up but when taken this way, its over quickly and it doesn't sit on your teeth. Just have a glass of water or juice nearby :-)

review/summary: Cured my daughter's GERD when Rx drugs couldn't
review/text: My 15 yr-old daughter was suffering from very bad GERD for six months. Prilosec and even Nexium didn't help much. She was a mess. Tried Bragg's at the recommendation of a friend.  In just a couple of days (1 tsp in ~8oz of water, morning and night), her GERD was much improved.  She is doing so much better now (she's been on it for 3 months), and with no side effects from prescription meds.  This is truly amazing stuff!!!

review/summary: Selsun Blue works better for Dandruff/Dry Scalp... However the ACV did help in other ways
review/text: Ever since the start of this year & for the past half a year, my scalps condition has continued to worsen, almost every night it has itched like crazy, my hair has even begun to thin a bit, it's nothing notciable once it's dry but after steping out of the shower with sopping wet hair you can see the scalp slightly.<br /><br />I tried everything that would supposedly help cure me of the condition. Scalp Massage, Combing + conditioning my hair more frequently, using shampoo's without alcohol or sodium lauryl sulfate, putting on a hat when outdoors, drinking more water, washing hair with more cold water... And nothing seemed to help at all.<br /><br />Unfortunately I had overlooked Apple Cider Vinegar & thought nothing of it. However, desperate & having read more on how it fully restores hair to its former healthy state I purchased a 16oz bottle, shipping was FAST, btw, very content with that, the affordable price & that it doesn't expire for another 5 years. =]<br /><br />It's now been nearly a month since I begun using the ACV, & overall while my hair isn't thinning any longer, the dandruff & dry scalp continued to persevere. Selsun Blue I found helps to rid of dandruff/dry scalp instantaneously in a couple of days, but still once every week I intend to use the ACV as an alternative shampoo just to switch things up.<br /><br />IF YOU INTEND TO USE THE ACV TO WASH YOUR HAIR only use once on a weekly basis, if used more then the dandruff/scalp condition will resume as apple cider vinegar contains an acidic material.<br /><br />However despite the ACV not helping my hair much, I did find it to be of use in many other health aspects. Thankfully as I stated it does help cease thinning hair. I noticed that it trimmed a bit of belly fat from me, so it's a pretty decent weight loss solution. I notice that i'm not obtaining headaches when outside exposed to the sun for a long duration of hours. It serves as a nice energy drink for whenever i'm in need of a boost & I notice myself no longer feeling sick.<br /><br />I usually tend to consume 2 cups of ACV twice daily. Once in the morning & once in the afternoon as that is when the body is in need of energy the most. Do not drink the ACV on its own as your throat will sting, I advise filling a cup with 1 tablespoon of ACV, filling the rest with water & if desired a teaspoon of baking soda.

review/summary: Great starter for making homemade vinegar
review/text: I bought this vinegar because it had the mother, and I wanted to use that as a starter culture for making my own vinegar from my abundance of wild grapes.  Well, the grapes aren't ripe yet, but I decided to experiment, using it to start a small batch of pineapple vinegar.  I cut the skin off the pineapple, popped it in a big glass jar, covered it with purified water and a couple tablespoons of Bragg's ACV, put the lid on very loosely (must have air to make vinegar) and let it ferment for a week.  I then strained out the pineapple skin and let it ferment for 3 more weeks (stirring it daily).  The new mother formed quickly and perfectly, and I didn't have any mold issues at all.  The pineapple vinegar tastes so good, I am making more!<br /><br />In the meantime, since I had most of a bottle of the ACV left, I decided to try it as a drink, hoping it will help with my allergies.  I just started this a couple days ago, so I can't attest to any results just yet.  But I put 2 teaspoons in a 16 oz bottle of water, and add some stevia to sweeten it up and pop it in the fridge to get cold.  Tastes GREAT!  I tried it without the sweetener and it was too harsh, but with it, it is almost like ACV lemonade -- very delicious and refreshing!  I also just started adding it to my dog's water to see if it helps with his allergies.<br /><br />Even if it doesn't end up helping with my household's allergy problems (but here's to hoping), it's still defintely worth it just as a starter for anyone interested in making their own homemade vinegars.

review/summary: You would be surprised at what this little old vinegar can do!
review/text: I have been stocking this in my cabinet for years. I used to drink a tsp in a cup of warm filtered water w raw honey. Now that I have a daughter who is ill, we have purchased empty capsules for me to fill w her meds. I just squirt the acv into a couple of empty capsules and swallow them quick because the enzymes in it starts to break down the capsule quick. Then i have my warm honey and water drink. I also give my daughter acv 15 min before eating because it really does stimulate your stomach to start digesting foods better, and relieves heartburn. My daughter needed both of these and acv work well for it. It also got rid of a wart on her finger. I also use it on my kids hair when there is a lice scare at school. I spray their hair after shampooing, let it sit for a min, then rinse well. When i blow dry my daughters hair afterward it is shiny! Supposedly it makes the hair less appealing to lice, so they wont want to hop on their head as much. So far no lice and shiny hair.<br />I initially started taking it to balance out my system. I must warn  people not to overdo it, you can give your self a UTI...it will wash away a lot of your good bacteria as well as bad so, a little dab will do ya. More is not always better. I do get energy boosts from it, which is nice. I get it at my grocery store for cheaper than here, too.<br />ALSO, if you make homemade soups with chicken or beef bones, throw a tbl in right when you start. It leeches out all the good minerals from the bones like calcium that your body needs. Leaves no flavor, promise.

review/summary: To my astonishment, some of those claims are actually true
review/text: Apple Cider Vinegar has undergone a lot of scrutiny, and I tried it only because it is harmless if used sparingly.  I drink a few capfuls in juice once daily.  To my utter amazement, it knocked the pain out of my knees the first day.  Although that did not last, I had many days where the edge was taken off the pain, allowing me to forego aspirin and ibuprofen, and enjoy my day.  However, this does not seem permanent in my case.  There seems to be a keeper, though - one of my daily medications causes me to retain water.  This brand of vinegar relieved the bloating within a few days so that I could slip into my jeans, bend, and even zip a skirt I have been unable to wear.  My ankles stopped swelling so that my feet don't hurt and my shoes are comfortable.  My bras now fit, my face is slimmer, my skin eruptions have lessened.  Plus, I rarely crave sweets now and, when I do, my sweet tooth is satisfied with snacks that are not as sweet as before.  For example, tea cookies rather than glazed doughnuts.  These effects have been steady and even lasted after I stopped the vinegar for a few days. A pleasant side effect for me was that my dreams were noticeably gentler and tended to have a more domestic element.

review/text: This is a good quality vinegar for use on salads and in other recipes. The smell is fairly strong, with a "fermented" note reminiscent of blue cheese.<br /><br />This food is relatively high in potassium.<br /><br />The "live" component makes it usable as a fermentation starter in grains (e.g. soaking several cups of dry oatmeal for 24 hours in water mixed with a teaspoon of this vinegar).<br /><br />Anecdotal evidence suggests that some people may have successfully used raw apple cider vinegar to reduce or eliminate incidences of the skin condition solar keratosis (aka actinic keratosis). They applied the vinegar with a swab, q-tip, or even fingertips three to ten times a day for about a month.

In the past I have always had to take antibiotics to clear up bronchitis.  I work around kids all day, and we went through a week or so where many many kids were sick, in the hall, at their desks, some of the teachers caught what the kids had.  I take some every day and have been fine.  2 or 3 teaspoons diluted in a glass of water.  A dash or two of ginger helps to offest some of the bitter, sour taste.  I tried this on a subway sandwich instead of having them put their vinegar on it.  Not the same taste.  Won't do that again.

My dentist advised to brush teeth immediately after taking this as acid and sugar from food when mixed in mouth hastens the cavities and will eventually weaken or damage the teeth.<br /><br />now, for other uses:<br />mixed in a solution and used as body odor eliminator. (mom does this) oh, we do that in the facility when chemicals can't control odor anymore.<br /><br />soak it on whites to make it brighter. not the best thing to use on colored fabrics as it can bleach (tho havent really tried it yet)<br /><br />a good sports drink as it contains potassium for electrolyte replenishment

After finding it very strong and sour and difficult to drink even when diluted, I googled to see how others tackled this and came across the Bragg brand. After trying it out, I can say that it is like night and day compared with the other one. Much more easy to drink and easily dilutes with other drinks. I probably would have given up the whole idea of taking apple cider vinegar if it wasn't for the improved taste and ease at which the general flavor can be diluted of the Bragg brand. As to whether or not it has done anything for me health-wise is a different question all together. Can't say for sure, but if you are going to take apple cider vinegar, I can say that this one was a winner for me.

review/summary: Fantastic Flavor!
review/text: My V&O salad dressings are just plain bland when I run out of this vinegar.  The kick Bragg's Apple Cidar Vinegar gives my salads is just awesome, either used as the only vinegar, or used 50/50 with others like red wine vinegar or balsamic.  It also cooks fantastically.  My Mom's "sweedish meatballs" recipe was actually improved with this ingredient, something I didn't think possible.<br /><br />Also, I don't use it for the health benefits, though many stake claims to them.  I cured my heartburn/acid reflux cutting simple carbs out of my diet.  But if this works, congrats!  It's better than liver & heart destroying pharms!

review/summary: Excellent for hemorrhoid cure!
review/text: This isn't for this specific brand, just ACV in general.<br />I bought a bottle of ACV off the bottom shelf at my Kroger grocery store.<br />I applied ACV with a cottonball directly on my hemmorhoid.  The next day it was half the size.<br />I continued a couple times a day.  After a few days, it was totally gone!<br /><br />I lived with this stupid roid for 2 years before finding out the cure was $5 on the bottom shelf at Kroger.

review/summary: Good vinegar, but no miracle product
review/text: Good vinegar, but I didn't get skinnier by drinking it daily (believe me, I tried!) and it doesn't make me feel better when I'm sick. I wish it did! I used it daily for about 2 months, so I would have expected something by then.  It's good vinegar though if you're making a salad :)

review/summary: It's vinegar!
review/text: When I first purchased this vinegar at a GNC after reading the reviews posted here about a year ago, I decided on taking it via a shot, as a way to chase it down quick, and to avoid further erosion of my teeth enamel. Don't do it.<br /><br />I had my mom do a shot of vinegar with me once, and she didn't know she was supposed to tilt her head back and take it down in one shot...She kind of burned her esophagus and got nauseous. I also quit for a few months because I was tired of/disgusted by the flavor of undiluted vinegar. Needless to say, don't take it in shot form, especially if you have a damaged esophagus.<br /><br />I now have taken up my vinegar drinking habits and use it like one would use a lemon (in cold drinks and dishes). I add two teaspoons to iced tea, and if you don't smell it, I swear it tastes just like a lemon iced tea. Use it in coleslaw and salads; The possibilities are endless. Just don't use this vinegar when cooking food, because high heat kills all the beneficial enzymes swimming around in the vinegar that make it have such marvelous health benefits.<br /><br />And please don't complain about the taste. This is vinegar; you cannot get around that fact. If you can't stomach the taste, try using the smallest recommended amount (one teaspoon), dilute it in a large cup water or (natural) fruit juice, and just drink it. If you have to use a sweetener use the recommended honey, stevia, black strap molasses, or Maple syrup; Agave can probably be used as well.<br /><br />My recent bottles, although cloudy, didn't have a mother floating in them.

review/text: I am using this with an organic honey I bought. It tastes very acidic so this size will last you quite a long time since all you need is literally a teaspoon more than that and it burns your throat. Definately would recommend you can notice the results and feel better.

review/summary: From a skeptic: this stuff WORKS!
review/text: A coworker shared her Braggs ACV one day at work when I came in terribly hungover (I swear this is not a common occurance, but hey,I'm only human), to help flush my system. I can't say that it was a miracle hangover cure, because really nothing is and if someone knows of one message me will ya, but it sparked my interest in this natural remedy. I bought my own bottle and began drinking 1 to 2 tablespoons diluted with water before bed. I didn't expect to see any miracles occur, or even to notice a difference in how I felt, and at first I didn't. However, after a few weeks it dawned on me that I had not felt tired at all throughout the day. Nope, no usual after lunch, lethargic, I need a GD siesta feeling! It also dawned on me that everyone in my family had been sick, not to mention salon clients who pumped themselves full of cold medicine to come get their roots touched up, as they all but sneezed in my mouth while getting their bangs trimmed. I mean really? While I'm mixing your color you want me to mix your Theraflu too? Stay home!!! Sorry, that sneezing thing is gross but a reality, and guess who defied the odds and did NOT get sick? Me!(I figured you got that but just in case). And on top of that, and maybe the best difference I noticed, is that I slept like a freakin' baby. I had grown accustomed to waking up 1 to 2 nights a week and not being able to fall back asleep for four or so hours. I would toss, turn, my mind would race, then I would flip on the tv and watch 6 syndicated episodes of Roseanne in a row at 3 in the morning. Now as much as people are impressed that you can name all 6 of Aunt Jackie's professions in chronological order, they are even more impressed when you don't nod off in your car while at a four way stop. I'm telling you I got the most restful and peaceful sleep I have had in years. Like that deep NyQuil sleep, except you're sober when your alarm goes off in the morning. So I have continued the ACV regimen for months now, and if I wasn't convinced before, a couple weeks ago I didn't take it for 5 days and guess what happened? Yep, daytime tiredness, moody as can be, and insomnia for the first time since I discovered this wonderful rotten battery acid tasting magic that is so so good for you. Now, this expiriment is by no means scientifically sound and there are, of course, some uncontrolled variables that come into play. But from this skeptic's point of view, this stuff is the jam. I just know it works. And as for the afformentioned unpleasant flavor? I plug my nose while I chug it and pretend its lemonade. Doing this completely blocks the flavor and you just have the acidic mouthfeel. Those who tell you the flavor is good or just to add a little honey and its good or whatever, are lying. They will probably also tell you that they LOVE the taste of quinoa and that apple sauce makes the perfect substitute for butter in your baked goods. Okay so takeaway, get yourself some Braggs and get on the road to better energy, immunity, and quality, sound sleep (I probably could have just said that right off the bat and spared your the rest, huh? Sorry.)

review/summary: Magical Beauty Product
review/text: I bought this on a whim at my natural foods store, but I will be purchasing it here in the future because it is much cheaper online.  I have read all over the internet that this is a great beauty product, and really wonderful for your hair.  I started doing weekly vinegar scalp treatments (50/50 ratio with water) a few weeks ago, and I have noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount of hair that I'm shedding.  I apply the treatment directly to my scalp using a hair dye application bottle (with a small pointed tip), and then wrap my hair up in a towel for about an hour.  I then wash it out and style normally. I am not sure how it works, but I am now losing about 1/4 of the hair that I used to during my daily washing/styling routine.  I also noticed that my scalp doesn't itch anymore.  It was never a big problem in the past, but it is something that I have noticed :)<br /><br />I also started having acne a few months ago, and I went to my doctor, and he prescribed an antibiotic cream, because he thought it was an allergic reaction to something.  The antibiotic cream didn't clear up the acne.  On a whim (again), I applied a 50/50 ratio of Bragg's vinegar to my face at night on a cotton ball (I take off my makeup with this mixture instead of washing my face; I hate washing my face at night for some reason), and within a week, my acne completely cleared up.  Again, I don't have any idea how this works, but it has worked wonderfully for me.<br /><br />My skin loves this stuff, and I am so happy that I found it.  I am also so thankful that it is nontoxic and it doesn't have a bunch of harmful chemicals in it.  Next to coconut oil, this vinegar is my holy grail beauty product :)

review/summary: Not Worth Your Money or Time
review/text: I bought these on an impulse at the store, thinking they would be amazing. I had tried toasts and crackers similar to this brand (in theory).<br /><br />They were horrid, I couldn't eat them by themselves, and they were too hard, crumbly, and over flavored. I attempted to eat them with laughing cow cheese spread and it didn't work, the taste was still nasty.<br /><br />In the end the only way I was able to them was by dipping them in soup like regular toast, and even then they were hardly bearable, or dipping them in cheese soup or fondue.<br /><br />I would suggest skipping them, they are a waste of time and money, unless you like hard, crumbly, oily, over flavored chips.

I've tried many other types of Gnocchi and these are definitely one of our favorites.  They cook up in no time and are oh so delicious with just a bit of olive oil and spices or with pasta sauce.

review/summary: Love these
review/text: Despite the price listed being exhorbitant and I've never paid even close to that at local stores, these are excellent...if you like this type of candy.  It's a firmish, jelled, fruity (various flavors and made with real fruit!) square with nuts and covered in a powdery sugar.  You can find various boxes without nuts, different fruits and I think even a variation with chocolate.  I find all of them to be wonderful.  I have eaten these for over a decade although I started out just getting them during the holidays..I now buy them when I can find them.
