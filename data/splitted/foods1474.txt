review/text: I've enjoyed Red Bull for a few years now and like being able to order it here on Amazon with Prime (2-day ship, no extra cost). I also appreciate the cost advantage of the Subscribe and Save (-15%) program. The drink gives me a nice smooth increase in energy when I need a little bit of help in that regard.<br /><br />Edit 10Mar12: I removed my complaint dealing with the per ounce pricing error since they responded to my notification and made the change. First time for everything. Thanks Amazon.

review/text: I may be addicted to Red Bull... the only thing I wish they did was sell at a greater discount in greater quantities! That being said, these arrived in good condition & of course they tasted delicious! But that's just me... Nothing bad about them. The only thing with the bigger cans is you are getting a cheaper per ounce price, but you're forced to drink more ounces at a time since it will go flat if you try to save it.

review/summary: great kids snack
review/text: i've been buying this for over a year now - initially for myself, and now for my kids. my 3 year old takes this to school almost daily as a snack. i didn't want her eating high-sugar processed foods (gummies, roll-ups, rice-crispy treats), but i didn't want her to feel like she was getting a dud snack while her friends had the "good (albeit bad) stuff". luckily she LOVES these (along with my 18 month old). they're easy for the kids to eat with their hands as a snack due to the shape/size. the kids also eat it for cereal in the mornings here and there - i usually mix it with the envirokids organic panda puffs (i eat half. yum!). i don't understand why so many kid snacks are so full of sugar and junk which is why i was happy to find a cereal that doubles as a snack. original flavor is delicious along with the peanut butter as well - all are sweetened just enough to make it good, but not too much to make it sickeningly sweet. this is a basic staple in our cereal collection.

I can't ask for much more.

review/summary: Love Mint Magic Tea
review/text: OK, I'm just pricing today -I usually buy this at the supermarket.  However, it seems Amazon is cheaper (when you buy in bulk) and has a much wider selection.  I just wanted to say, though, that I absolutely love this mint tea.  The mint really wakes me up as it is so refreshing, but it is also calming.  I drink at least a couple of cups daily and especially when I am studying.  All Celestial Seasonings herbal teas are fantastic, and I've grown up drinking them.  They are my favorite teas -always top quality and nearly all the herbal teas are caffeine free.  I also like the Mandarin Orange and Cinnamon Apple Spice a lot.  Red Zinger and Lemon Zinger (love this one when I have an irritated throat) are hits, but the Honey Vanilla Chamomile isn't among my favorites -I prefer the regular Chamomile.  Finally, Sleepy Time Tea is something quite special and I drink it once in a while; it really helps me to sleep quickly and sleep throughout the night without waking up at all.<br /><br />Drinking tea is so good for your health as long as you stick with decaf herbal teas.  It's a good way to relax, stay hydrated, and flush out toxins.  These teas are so good that you don't even need honey, but sometimes a bit of honey is nice (also try organic blue agave nectar).<br /><br />Happy tea drinking everyone!

I just placed my third order for this item.  It will remain a fixture in my home.

Most do not have that great, unique flavor of this brand's toasted brown rice. I think the foil lined packet also helps the tea retain its flavor. Either way, happy day!

review/text: Genmai cha is green sencha tea mixed with toasted rice. That's about how this tastes as well.<br /><br />It's like drinking a mild green tea mixed in with a strong popcorn/rice taste and smell.<br /><br />Very fragrant and strong but not overpowering taste.<br /><br />I'm new to uppity tea criticism but this is the best I've tried so far and I've spent far far more on far less. I certainly wouldn't want this to be my only green tea as the rice drowns out it's subtler flavors but this is a definite must have.<br /><br />Was surprised at the freshness and quality of this tea at this price point.

review/text: This is the only green tea I drink anymore, I make it daily or every other day. This 90 bag value pack was great for sharing with friends. Now they're hooked as well!<br /><br />Yamamotoyama also sells this tea in a box of 16 bags, and you can buy a 12-pack of those boxes on Amazon. For some reason, the boxed stuff tastes slightly better to me. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X0RV7O">Yamamotoyama Genmai-cha Green Tea with Roasted Brown Rice, 1.69-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>

review/text: I cannot believe how fast these people ship.  This was my second order, and it arrived, if not overnight, then pretty darn close to it.  I think they must work around the clock, since I've seen orders fulfilled and shipped on Sunday nights.<br /><br />The teas are also excellent, and a great bargain for anyone who drinks a lot of tea, as I do.  I drink this as well as their Sushi Bar Style tea.<br /><br />While I'd rather the teabags came in a box, the bag packaging is convenient because there are 9 packets of half a dozen or so teabags, which are convenient for throwing in a purse or suitcase.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: I went to a Korean restaurant a few months ago and while I was waiting for my to-go order, they gave me this wonderfully delicious tea.  I asked them what it was -- brown rice tea, they said.  I think they made it in house, because I couldn't get a brand name from them.  Who knows, perhaps they didn't want to share their secret :)  Either way, it prompted me to discover Genmai Cha, and I've been quite happy with this brand.  Although I should note that it's only close to and not as 'brown-ricey' as the tea at the Korean restaurant.  Perhaps because it's a green tea/brown rice mix.  Has anyone out there found pure brown rice tea?  Does it exist?  Anyway, we went through the 90 pack quicker than I thought we would, so I will be ordering again.

review/summary: Something Different
review/text: This tea is probably not for everyone because of it's unique flavor. For an avid tea drinker like me, however, it's a very enjoyable change. If you are tired of just drinking plain green tea or are bored with the same old fruity varieties, this might be a tea for you.<br /><br />If you do choose this tea, I recommend that you brew it for 3 to 4 minutes to get the full taste. This allows the almost popcorn like undertone to come out. I put just a little sweetener in it most of the time, but have enjoyed it both ways. If you are truly ready for something a little different then you should probably give this one a try.

review/summary: Love this Pac!
review/text: This product eliminates the hassle of digging through a giant diaper bag.  I make sure that I keep a bib in one compartment so that everything I need is in one place.  I stand it up on one side of the bag, so I just reach in, grab it, and start feeding.  Do be warned that Gerber plastic containers do leak once they have been opened, so don't stand this pac on-end if you put an unfinished tub in it.  You may also try carrying a zippered sandwich bag in the compartment with the bib so that any possibility of leak-through is avoided.  Another added bonus is that it will hold two 2nd foods Gerber plastic containers in one of the center compartments, which is nice for long trips.  I also keep baby's meds (orajel, tylenol, motrin, mylicon, etc.) in one compartment when we're on long trips so that I know exactly where they are and so that they are well-insulated.

review/text: The jar pac is a excellent way to carry around baby food jars with extra space for spoons, napkins, bibs... The jars don't clank together and you can grab it on the go with the convenient handle. The sections are separated by velcro dividers which is great if you want to create a bigger space and store a baby bottle instead of a jar. I've used it much more than I thought I would and I really love it.

review/summary: The best travel pack ever!!
review/text: This by far is the coolest thing ever.  It says it holds 6 jars, but if you have the gerber plastic containers 2 of those will fit in 1 space so it can hold more than that.  I can put 3-4 spoons in as well.  I can take this anywhere as it is so compact and holds so many jars and everything is together.  My son drove from Texas to south Florida with me, just the 2 of us, with a full car.  I had this on the floor board of the car and when we stopped and ate I just threw it in the stroller and went inside.  There is no digging for stuff and no jars rattling around.  I really do highly recommend this.  If you travel at all you will use it over and over and over again.  It really does pay for itself the first time you use it!!

review/summary: This is my favorite tea
review/text: I never really liked tea.  Not iced, not with peach, mango or honey.  I didn't like chai with cream, rose hip  or green tea with organic raw sugar.  But it turned out what I really didn't like was tea bags and the taste you get from them.  I've found out a little bit about tea in the last couple of years.<br /><br />First, the tea that comes in tea bags are dregs, they are the leavings, the split ends, if you will, of dried tea leaves.  It doesn't sound like it would matter much, whole, intact dried leaves versus almost powdery crumbs, but it does.  The taste of tea made with a bag is wholly different, it even looks different, a little cloudy, more opaque and the taste isn't as bright and assertive (sorry, I don't mean to sound like a tea snob, I'm not a food snob, I'm writing this while trying to keep the crumbs of my powdered donut from landing on my keyboard, mhhmmf!).<br /><br />The first time I drank a real tea, one made with leaves I was ill.  I had a sore throat, runny nose and a slight temperature.  We were moving and I had a long day of hard furniture moving labor ahead of me (somehow I always end up ill when we move so that the icky moving experience can ratchet up to truly horrific).  We stopped at a coffee shop (I'd packed the coffee maker the day before, my bad) but coffee didn't sound like a great idea when I was so congested, so I bought a jasmine green tea, I picked it at random and was surprised when my to go cup arrived with a long, weird paper cone full of dried tea leaves.  We were in a hurry, so I grabbed some sugar packets and headed out.  That tea was a revelation, it smelled nice and tasted even better.  It even made my sore throat less razor-y.<br /><br />I've since bought several full leaf teas and Irish Breakfast, this one in particular, is my favorite, it's great with a kiss of cream and a liberal spoonful of sugar.  It isn't hard to brew and is adaptable, you can make it brisk and chewy at seven minutes or light and delicate at four.<br /><br />I used to buy this exact brand at my local natural food store, but buying it online from VitaminLife it tastes even better, perhaps it's the sealed pack and that the leaves arrive fresh and less crumbly (the tea at the store has been transferred into a clear plastic pourable jug, maybe its the sunlight, maybe it gets shaken and broken, I don't know, but this tea is like manna from heaven, it's even replaced my morning coffee sometimes (I'm a coffeeholic and the only time I've gone without for more than a couple of days was when I was pregnant).

review/summary: A versatile starting point -- here's how to boost the flavor and nutrition
review/text: What's great about this mix? 1) Super easy, 2) Great, moist texture even when you change the recipe, and 3) Really good value, especially on Subscribe and Save. It's got a healthful set of ingredients -- whole wheat flour, molasses, brown sugar, baking soda, and spices. The large amount of molasses is unusual for a mix, and it adds rich flavor and lots of magnesium, calcium, potassium and iron. The whole grain adds nutrition and fiber. And best of all, it mixes easily, bakes up perfectly every time (I've made about 15 batches so far), and my 5-year-old loves it. It's great as an after-school snack; it satisfies his sweet tooth without feeding him junk.<br /><br />The one fault this mix has, IMO, is that it's a little bland. For some, that's perfect. But for me, it's a challenge -- what can I do to pump up the flavor? Here are some of the "hacks" I use to make my gingerbread tastier:<br /><br />I grate a hefty amount of fresh ginger into the mix, and/or add a heaping teaspoon of powdered ginger and/or cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Orange zest also adds to the flavor. And I frequently substitute orange juice or carrot juice, or a mix, for the 1-1/2 cups of milk that's called for in the recipe.<br /><br />I mash two ripe bananas, put them into a measuring cup, add fresh grated nutmeg and fresh ginger, and add milk or carrot juice to make 1-1/2 cups of wet ingredients to substitute for the milk. Wow, you wouldn't believe how great banana gingerbread smells and tastes, and the texture is so moist and tender.<br /><br />The Hodgson Mill site also taught me a great hack -- substitute a 15-oz can of pumpkin and 3/4 cup orange juice for the milk and fat.<br /><br />You can add nuts, grated carrots, craisins, pretty much whatever you want, and this extremely reliable mix always turns out well. Pretty much any flavor or food that works with ginger and molasses can be added to this bread with good results, as long as you don't change the dry/wet ratio.<br /><br />I highly recommend this mix either as an enjoyable, if mild, snack, or as a base for your own expansions and explorations.

review/summary: Delicious, even when prepared the low-fat way!
review/text: I'm a big fan of the Hodgson Mill Flax Brownie mix and this seemed interesting so I gave it a go. I absolutely love it! I made mine with almond milk, egg white and 2 tbsp of natural applesauce rather than butter and it came out fantastic. This tastes like *real* gingerbread. Not overly sweet and with the perfect amount of spice. I was impressed by the texture also. Usually when I substitute applesauce in baked goods, the texture tends to get a little too sticky and heavy, but the gingerbread came out very fluffy and perfectly moist! I also added raisins which was a nice addition. I baked mine in an 8" x 8" baking dish and cut it into 8 decent sized servings which came to about 215 calories each (and is virtually fat free.) Perfect with a cup of coffee for a quick, healthy and filling breakfast. Will absolutely buy again! Who says healthy can't taste good?

review/text: Not only does this gingerbread come out light and delicious, the mix is very easy to work with and not in the least fussy. I even nuked it, with excellent results. The package does not have microwave directions. I have one of those microwave ring form dishes, with fairly high sides and it is great for baking any quickbread recipe. If you try it, use only 1/2 the package mix-- be sure it is not over 1 1/2 cups measured. (A little less might be better). Use 1 whole egg and half the amounts of other ingredients. Grease the ring pan with a little spray, put in the batter, and microwave rotating for 4 1/2 minutes. I hate to say it, but I even cheated on the directions, just using a wire whisk  and blending the egg, milk and one of those light, heart-healthy margarines into the batter all together. It still came out great--and the whole time from start to finish was no more than 10 minutes.

review/text: I'm surprised to see all those 5-star reviews. I bought these mixes directly from Hodgson Mill. The first time we made it the bread was very heavy and not very sweet. The second time I added some sugar but we still didn't enjoy the very dense texture. What to do with all those other boxes?  We bought a box of another brand of gingerbread mix (which would probably have been too sweet on its own) and combined the two and it came out fine. I'm an experienced baker so I don't think I did anything wrong - with such simple instructions there isn't much you can make a mistake on but it's been a while so maybe they've changed the formula a bit.

review/text: This gingerbread is very good if you're used to eating healthy whole wheat foods. I like the real molasses and ginger flavor and the denseness of the bread. It is very moist and not too sweet.

review/summary: Easy and delicious
review/text: This mix was so easy to make, required very few additional ingredients & was quick.  We served it with Cool Whip and it was delicious.  It is also low in calories and healthy too.  But don't expect to be able to use it in your bread machine because that won't work.  Be prepared to make it the old fashioned way, in the oven.

review/summary: Very Heavy and Dense and not quite gingery!
review/text: To each, his own...there may be people who will like this, but for us, it was extremely heavy and not much spice flavor to it. It was very moist and the consistency was good, but the whole wheat makes it a very heavy cake. What we didn't care for most is the flavor...or lack thereof.  I think it might be ok if you add powdered spices to it when you are mixing it. Maybe some ginger, cloves, nutmeg, etc...It sorta reminds me of boston brown bread you buy in the can when made as directed. So, not our cup of tea, but you may like it. It's not horrible...just not for us.

review/text: I ordered 3, 5lb containers of orange blossom honey. Shipping honey can be dicey, there's always a chance you're going to open a box to an exploded plastic container and a huge mess, not to mention useless honey. Not so with these guys. Each jug had the lid taped, and then each was sealed up in its own plastic bag and then they were double boxed. I greatly appreciate the little bit of extra effort. Not only was the shipping fast and well packaged they were also considerably less in cost for a bulk item than anyone else I could find. I'll definitely buy from them again.

review/summary: Best dog food your dog will ever eat!!!
review/text: My dog has been eating Spot Stew for the past four years or so. She really eats this stuff up. Not knowing that Spot Stew recently changed their bag size from 30 lbs to 28 lbs (bleh), I thought Amazon didn't sell this product with their Amazon Prime delivery so I went out to buy alternatives. Before Spot Stew, my dog ate up the dog food that was found in Three Dog Bakery. According to Three Dog, their food was made with high quality foods that a human could eat it. This was true because my dog ate this up... before Spot Stew, that is.<br /><br />And that is the curse to giving your dog the best food you can buy. My dog won't eat the Three Dog Bakery food anymore. I first thought she was sick, then after 4 days of trying different things, we found out it was just because my dog is now a food princess. So Beware!

review/summary: Easiest transition to a new dog food I have ever experienced!
review/text: I don't buy things because of celebrity endorsements, and frankly I resisted buying this dog food because it was celebrity endorsed - I thought it was a gimmick. I was wrong to have waited so long to try it - It smelled delicious the moment we opened the bag.  The are actual herbs in the food and you can see bits of veggies.  My dog loved this food, and the cat eats it too, when he can get his paws on it.  The best part of this is that it was the smoothest transition to a new food that we have ever made.  In the past I have had to take up to a month to transition food.  With Halo, my dog's stomach adjusted to the change over very nicely and at the end of a week she was eating 100% Halo Spot's stew, lamb recipe. I hope they always keep their quality as good as it is now- Thanks Halo!!

Dumb Stupid move on my part, cruel move for my golden.  within 2 days she was chewing patches of skin off her hind end in clumps 2 inches round.  OMG I feel like the worst Mum ever!!!!  Even returning to my original food did not help.  I was home sick one day and watched an episode of Ellen.  Next day, ordered Halo online.  Took just a few days and the itching stopped and now the hair has regrown after 3 weeks on Halo dry.  THANK YOU!!!!

review/summary: Halo is a wonderful dog food!
review/text: Our dog has been on this food for approximately 8 months now. It has helped her skin and coat quite a bit, and is also somewhat helpful for her allergies. Not to mention she absolutely loves it! She'll do just about anything for her "Spot's Stew." She's an 8 year old German Shepherd, and knows her food by name. She loves the treats, too. We really have looked high and low, and this is the best possible food we can find for her. Yes, it's a little pricey, but not bad when you consider the quality of it. We were ordering directly through Halo, but their online ordering system was giving us problems at times, and then waiting for the free shipping code or coupons to come was becoming a problem. Also, you wait longer for it to ship. With Amazon, we get free super saver shipping and it arrives much quicker. We will continue to use this method, as our local Petco does not usually have the large size bag of the Lamb in stock. Not to mention it's easier having it delivered. No time and no running necessary. I would purchase this food again and again and again!

The flavor lasts for a decent amount of time (it's gum, it's not meant to be chewed forever).

You should all do some research on the dangers of them before purchasing, I am not blaming the makers of air for making me allergic to it but I am going to supposedly consume it then preach about the dangers of it and give it a bad rating.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the show House you might remember this clinic patient: "A recent ex-smoker comes in with diarrhea. The patient is using gum to deal with his oral fixation. House points out the sorbitol sweetener in the gum is a laxative."<br /><br />I like this gum and especially the thin packaging, it was a good price here on Amazon.

review/summary: Can cause bad reaction!!!
review/text: Bad side affects!!!<br /><br />It doesn't happen to everyone, but to some people this gum has bad side affects. Don't worry, nothing is permanent, and if you've already consumed it and nothing happened, you're fine. It's just for some people, their body doesn't know how to process it properly, so short side affects are included. I'm not saying Orbit is at fault, because they have other excellent gum, but this did not go so well for me.<br /><br />It contains and ingredient called Aspartame, which is a fake sager. To learn more, go to this website: [...]<br /><br />When I ate it my lips got tingly, and my throat and tongue went numb. I also felt nauseous, had difficulty breathing and got a headache.<br /><br />If you've previously had Mono, or have it now, it can either bring out the Epstein Barr virus,(The virus that causes Mono) or temporarily make it worse.<br /><br />Also, if you have a muscle disease, you can temporarily experience muscle pain.<br /><br />Just remember, check gum boxes for any fake sugars, and remember that this doesn't happen with everyone, it can be rare. And again I'm not blaming Orbit for this problem, as this gum tasted great, my body just didn't agree with it.<br /><br />If you do have the symptoms, gargle and swish with salt water, drink a whole water bottle, and you should be fine within about half and hour.<br /><br />I encourage you all to do research on fake sugar.

review/summary: My favorite! I'm hooked!
review/text: As big of a coffee freak as I can be, I am still shocked that it took a drive across the country (from California to Florida), with a stop in New Orleans, for me to try Cafe Du Monde coffees.  However, thanks to a cross country drive, with a stopover in New Orleans, I picked up a can of CdM's Coffee and Chicory (as well as a can of the French Roast) and became HOOKED!  The flavor is robust and nutty without being overly bitter and I use it every day to make iced coffees at home.  The first can went in less than a week, and I ended up ordering six more cans (three of which went to work with my boyfriend).  We love this coffee, and it keeps us out of the chain coffee places with a nice buzz and a good reason to buy a better coffee maker!

review/summary: Good Coffee
review/text: I suppose it would all depend on your own taste, but I really like the taste of this particular brand of coffee.<br />Remember, you NEED to use proper amounts for good taste.  I have a regular filtered, drip type coffee maker. When using filter the first time I use 2 small scoops of coffee (probably a teaspoon each size) then the next pots thereafter, I use just one scoop per pot until the filter holder becomes full. That way you will get good flavored coffee.  Most coffees coming out of the Louisiana area with chicory added to them are a little stronger or robust that regular coffees like Folgers, Maxwell, etc., etc.

review/text: Living in New Orleans my whole life, I have always had easy access to this coffee. I like dark, rich, full-bodied coffee and Cafe Du Monde Coffee and Chicory fits my criteria. I make it pretty strong and then add real milk and sugar and it is better than anything I can find at a coffee shop or in the store. Now that I live in Mississippi, buying it off Amazon is the most cost-effective way for me to get my fix. Now if only fully cooked beignets could be shipped I'd be in heaven! Not for people who like weak coffee-if you can see the bottom of your cup through your coffee, this is too strong for you.

No heat/spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth, must be from the wax.  I was going to send it to my son in college but tossed it in the trash instead.  The sad thing is that they do NOT have to use trans fats to get flavor.  They just don't care.
