review/summary: Too Snapple-y
review/text: This is SUCH a great concept, and aside from being too sweet, I liked the Peach Mango. You wouldn't think there would be much difference between the two, but in my opinion, the tea really masked almost all of the delightful peachy flavor. The only way I liked this was a quick squirt in an entire pitcher of water. Then it isn't overly sweet, and it is just a touch of flavor. Flavor is such a subjective thing, so if you like very sweet drinks (like Diet Snapple)this might be for you.

review/summary: Fast and tasty.
review/text: I like Mio drinks, they dissolve fast and taste good for artificial kind of drink.<br />I prefer Mango peach over Peach tea. For me they don't taste bad at all. It's sugar free, (sucralose is used as a sweetener known also as splenda).<br /><br />The mini bottle is cute and great on the go, to keep it at work, gym etc. Just squirt few drops, shake or use the spoon to mix it and that's it!

review/summary: Yummy, but some concern over ingredients
review/text: Simply based on taste, I give this "Peach Tea" flavored water-enhancer a pretty good rating. It's certainly a lot better than Crystal Light or some of those other powders. I'm health conscious and drink pretty much nothing but water and the occasional carrot juice. After a while, I do admit, water can start to taste bland. I would occasionally like to drink something sweet without having to worry about all the sugar. Enter this MIO stuff, which seemed like it could fit the bill: in theory.<br /><br />I'm not a nutritionist, so I don't know how actually healthy this stuff is. My guess is that it's not healthy at all. Generally speaking, anything that tastes this sweet is not good for you. Here are the ingredients: Water, Malic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Citrict Acid, Contains less than 2% of natural flavor, Sucralose and Acesulfame potassium(Sweeteners), Potassium citrate, Polysorbate 60, Blue 1, Yellow 5, Red 40, Potassium Sorbate (Preservative).<br /><br />So yeah, a bunch of stuff I've never heard of plus some icky dyes. Personally, I'd just rather drink up a nice cool glass of purified water. It feels clean and tastes good, unlike MIO which is sweet and feels sugary going down. But, if for some reason you simply MUST drink something sweet, these little juice-it-ups might help out. Overall, I'd never spend a dime on them. And I DEFINITELY wouldn't spend $6 for a little bottle. But, because it was tasty, I do give it a solid average rating.

review/text: This is delicious! It makes a really tasty glass of tea, though it takes a few tries to determine just how much you need to acheive the proper proportion. The container is small enough to carry in your purse, and it can be easily added to bottled water. It is a great improvement over powdered instant tea--more natural flavor and no cloudy or foamy surface. I tried the peach, but I am open to trying other flavors as well.

review/summary: Not the best of the flavors
review/text: I don't particularly care for Mio; I think it tastes like chemicals. That said, my roommate loves the Mango Peach flavor. Absolutely loves it. Doesn't drink water without it. I got him the Peach Tea flavor as an alternative, but neither of us likes it. It's not tea, and we both taste only chemical flavor. In fact, he described it as tasting like pool water - highly chlorinated.

review/summary: Easy & Tasty
review/text: Easy to use: Just had to squeeze 2-3 second shot into my glass, stir for another few seconds and I had flavor. Didn't leave me any leftover powder residue (It's not a powder anyway) or a strange overdone aftertaste. I especially like the fact that I can control the amount of flavor that I am looking for, which can be done by the length or by how many 'shots' you want to squeeze into my glass. Not everyone taste is the same so I enjoy the fact that I can make this to my taste.<br /><br />Have always been a fan of peach tea, and even though MIO Peach Tea doesn't taste like Snapple it is still refreshing and better then the taste of water. For a person who is looking to cut down on soda and the cost of buying water additives (such as Crystal Light) which can get really pricy I have to say that I am satisfied by MIO. The taste is sweet, peachy, but not artificial and definitely something I will look forward to using in the summer time. I am also happy with the amount I am using to fit my taste and have to say that I can see this being a value for my money in comparison to other leading brands.<br /><br />Give it a shot, or even try another flavor since they do have so many other to try from.<br />FYI:<br />I do enjoy going for early morning bike rides and have been freezing water with MIO Peach Tea inside and it has been just as consistent in taste frozen as non while other brands can get very diluted while they defrost.

review/summary: Another MIO Winner!
review/text: I have now tried three types of liquid flavor enhancers from MIO and all of them have been excellent.  The peach tea has a subtle, yet full flavor and turned an ordinary bottle of water into something with some pizazz.  As MIO comes out with new flavors, I will be trying them, especially since I have had no adverse reactions to them.  Since I have many allergies, this was a worry, but eased quickly.

Has a bitterness to it and leaves a very unpleasant after-taste. Hard to identify the flavor as peach tea; though does smell like it.<br /><br />I really liked the idea of the little squeeze container for my purse; no little pouches to tear open then dispose of.

review/summary: Awesome tasting, convenient, tastes great, but...
review/text: It could be the sweetener that I might be allergic to it?, but after drinking this stuff, my mouth gets coated & I feel incredibly thirsty & dehydrated.<br /><br />Flavors are great (I HAD to try another flavot, the black cherry, to see if it was the flavoring - same result!)<br /><br />Has malic acid in it, and a few vitamins, yet can't read all the ingredients, so not sure if the problem is the dyes or the sweetener - could be either causing that severe thirst, which is why we want flavor/vitamin-enhanced water to begin with.<br /><br />I don't care that it's 0 calorie or not, but would LOVE to see these in the same form only with a sweetener & perhaps without the colors, that don't cause a reaction... This stuff should be labeled the "diet" version, as many of us have problems with diet sweeteners, OR, better yet, they could use something like "EZ Sweets", that most people don't react to adversely, unlike "Nutrasweet" & other zero-calorie drinks & drink mixes.<br /><br />If the color was gone or at the VERY least the sweetener changed, I'd give it 10 stars out of 5, if I could!<br /><br />This is a great idea for every day, to throw in your purse, car or whatever. The sweetener tastes OK, but either the sweetener or dyes cause extreme thirst, gas, and I don't feel well at all after drinking this stuff.<br /><br />Fun for college & HS students who seem to want to see who can drink it the strongest, or even right out of the bottle, which is VERY small & makes more servings than it says. Bottle says "24 servings", yet I think that's for large glasses (maybe 24oz or so?) The 1st time I tried it, I followed the directions & it was FAR too strong, so it only takes a little to go a LONG way!<br /><br />IF the sweetener (& possibly coloring) is changed & I don't get a bad reaction, and the taste is as good (I know the EZ Sweetz sweetener is fine), I'll be buying a LOT more of this stuff for the car, the house, my purse, overnight bags, traveling, etc.

review/text: I tried the MIO liquid peach tea in hopes of substituting it for an instant mix that I had been using. Unfortunately it does not even come close to peach tea. I was disappointed.<br /><br />When used as recommended (one squeeze per eight ounces of water) it has an extremely weak taste that does not resemble either peach or tea. It's difficult for me to understand why it is called an enhancer.<br /><br />I'll just stick with bottled water.

review/summary: "Peachy, but..."
review/text: I added MIO Liquid Enhancer to a 16.9 ounce of bottled water and took a sip, my first impression.  Smelled like peach.  Tasted like peach.  Instructions on bottle say each squeeze adds more flavor, one squeeze for each 8 ounces. So what is a squeeze?  Each person's squeeze is different.  I thought it might be a measured squeeze, so I squeezed it. Well I guess that was too much, it definitely was too sweet with over powering peachiness and left an unpleasant aftertaste that stayed in my mouth for a short time.<br /><br />I gave MIO Liquid a second try with a 16.9 ounce bottle of water and two small squeezes of MIO.  I sipped it. This time there was not enough peach flavor and there still was an aftertaste that stayed in my mouth.<br /><br />This product leaves a lot up to a person's personal taste and squeeze.  Each time I used it the results were different because each time a slightly different amount was added to the bottled water.  And even then it is still not a perfect flavor or taste.  Perhaps if it was premeasured, a chamber at the top that would fill when turned upside down with a measured amount would allow each drink to be more consistent.  Even so, this would not improve the aftertaste, Lipton and Crystal Light taste much better.  I will not be purchasing this product and can only give it one star.

I do love tea, especially peach tea, but after looking at the ingredients, I don't think I can drink this tea.  Also, I have read some bad remarks on this product, so it doesn't sound like it is all that good, anyway.  I am pretty sensitive to chemicals, and I don't know if these ingredients are chemicals or not, but I do like to stick to natural, simple ingredients that I do know about.  So that it doesn't go to waste, I will try to find somebody who is not sensitive to chemicals and big words.  I know lots of people who can eat/drink anything and it doesn't bother them.

review/summary: Un-naturally GROSS
review/text: Ugh. Has our collective diet really devolved into a state where big manufacturers and retailers actually sell this stuff - and more disappointingly, reviewers give it good ratings?<br /><br />Here's why this product is awful:<br /><br />* It tastes very artificial. Peach, really? Sorry, it doesn't really taste like any peach I've had. It taste like some fake fruit, with a bit of sourness from the citric acid...and get this, an AWFUL aftertaste that taste like the plastic bottle it comes in. Seriously, who actually tasted this stuff and approved it?<br /><br />* Just because the ingredient list says natural flavors, doesn't mean that it was derived from peaches. Did you know that an extract derived from beaver anal glands is used to flavor some vanilla- and raspberry-flavored food - and it only has to be labeled as a "natural flavor"? Who knows what the natural flavor in this thing really is, especially when you consider all the other artificial junk in this thing:<br /><br />* Fake sweeteners (which recent studies have shown still make you fat...and are potential carcinogens).<br /><br />* Fake dyes like red 40, yellow 5 and blue 1 - which still don't make it look appetizing.<br /><br />On the plus side, this stuff is certified Kosher. Go for it if that's your thing.<br />I'll trade you for a glass of plain water.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: I absolutely love peach tea. My favorite is diet peach by Snapple so I was very excited to try the MIO Luiquid Peach Tea but I did not like the product at all.<br /><br />I usually drink 4-6 16oz bottles of water each day so I thought the compact size of the MIO would be good to keep in my purse for when I wanted a change to my routine. The size and convenience was the only positive of this product.<br /><br />The directions specify 1 squirt per 8oz. The first time I tried the product with a 16oz water bottle I gave the flavoring two healthy squirts and the result tasted like cough medicine. Blech! I poured water out and watered that disaster down and managed to finish the rest of the water.<br /><br />On my next try I started out with a teeny tiny squirt and worked my way up to a decent flavoring but it still had a bad aftertaste that just didn't work for my tastes. I'll stick to plain old water or Snapple when I need a peachy fix.

review/summary: Requires 4 shots to get a semi-peach tea taste.
review/text: I absolutely love peach tea. I was happy to try Mio Liquid Peach Tea and Mio Peach/Mango Tea to see if it would be better than real peach tea or other peach tea brands. The idea is simple, make a syrup to add to your glass for some delicious tea wherever you are. No messy packets to mess with; No clouds of powder to smell. However, getting it to the right flavor took a lot of shots. The directions say one shot per each 8oz of water. I filled two glasses with 8oz of water. This review deals only with the peach.<br />On the first shot, you could get a hint of something but it definitely wasn't a peach flavor. The second shot smelled like peach but tasted like chlorinated water. The third shot had a wee bit of peach flavor and smelled stronger, but definitely not something you'd want to sit down and sip. The fourth and final shot got a more clear taste of peach but still not strong enough for my liking or my husband's. By the fourth shot and taste test, I decided it wasn't worth trying to add more to get a better flavor. Since each pack is enough liquid for 24 8oz servings (as stated on the packaging), I would say the actual number of glasses of tea you'd get from this using 4 shots each is 6 glasses - 24ozs. A whole lot less than 24 glasses.

review/summary: Handy and tasty way to UP your water intake.
review/text: MiO is a great little way to really up how much water I drink each day. I completely stopped sodas, because the mio, with ice cold water is far better. The peach tea for me is a 'sustainable' flavor. I drink it on a daily basis. The others are more 'in the mood' flavors for me. I really enjoy the blueberry pomegranate one as well. I went from drinking nearly no water to drinking 64+oz every day. I only add 1 squeeze to a 32oz bottle of water, as I like it mildly flavored. Lasts for a good week or more (3.99 for a weeks worth of flavored water, yay!)<br />The sweet ice tea flavor is one that you'll need double dosing of, as it tastes off when there's not a lot of it.<br /><br />And oh yeah. Chemicals, chmemicals. If you go from drinking SODA to the mio with water, you're still doing yourself a favor.

Even with several squirts is still taste a bit watery.<br />Now, this is from a juice/soda drinker - so keep that in mind. If you normally consume a lot of tea, the flavor may be right there for you. If you are looking for a water enhancer so you can drink more water - this may not do the trick.

review/text: I will admit that when I first tried Mio I wasn't all that impressed.

It tasted just like the other Peach Tea mixes that I regularly use (Snapple, Crystal Light). The bottle lasts for a good long while, depending on how much you use per serving. The good and bad is that you can't be exact because it squirts out.<br /><br />I have liked every flavor that I have tried; Peach Tea, Mango Peach, Fruit Punch, Strawberry Watermelon and Sweet Tea. The one thing I would change is the coloring. I'd be fine without it, but I suspect other's enjoy it as an indication of flavoring and how much they've put in based on the concentration of the coloring.

review/text: I like the idea of this product - a tiny bottle that can be stored almost anywhere, that can be added to water to give it a hint of flavor.  "Peach Tea" is the only flavor I have tried so far and I found it rather gross.  My opinion is rather subjective, but I thought it only had a vague hint of "peach" that was blocked out by a lot of tartness.  It also left a bad aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this product, but the taste just wasn't for me.  I'm going to give at least one other flavor a try to see if it's more palatable.  This product would be very convenient if I liked the flavor better since I could just put it in a cabinet at my office and add it to the water I'm drinking continuously throughout the day.  Adding it to water works far better than trying to mix powder to water, so I was disappointed that I didn't enjoy the taste.

review/summary: Great alternative to powdered flavorings for water
review/text: The MiO Peach Tea flavoring added to bottled water tastes good. I don't use artificial sweeteners that often, so I do think there is a bit of an aftertaste, but not as much as products containing Aspartame. (MIO contains Sucralose and Acesulfame Potassium). I would actually prefer the product with real sugar, but then of course it wouldn't be zero calories!<br /><br />It's a little hard to get the right amount of flavoring into the water, but when I could get the correct amount, my water did taste like Peach Tea. I just squeeze the bottle, as opposed to trying to measure it drop-by-drop, so that could be why I was having the problem of ending up with too much flavoring.<br /><br />I like this product so much better than the powdered flavorings for water I have tried. The liquid blends in with the water and there's no mess like there can be when adding powder to a bottle of water.

review/summary: Flavorful peach
review/text: I love the fact that I can add as much or as little of this product to my water as I like. This allows you to adjust to your personal taste. It is compact and can throw it into my purse and have it with me on the go. Peach tea is one of my favorite flavors and I am very happy with the product and will be purchasing more. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: My husband and I really enjoyed MIO Liquid Peach Tea. I like how you can add what you want and not just have a powder, like others. It's very easy to take with you, it's pretty small. It does pack a punch, so don't add too much or you'll have a very stong taste. But other than that, the flavor is great and what you would expect. I would try the other flavors!

review/summary: good, not too sweet flavor
review/text: This has a good peach tea flavor.  Not being from the south I find Mio's sweet tea too sweet, but this is just right.  It is not my favorite flavor (berry pomegranate is), but I like a small squirt of this in my Soda Stream charged water.  I don't like it as strong as the label suggests, so I get a lot more bottles than the listed 24.  I really like that you can use this to make a beverage as strongly or weakly flavored as possible.  Recommended.

review/summary: Very sharp taste
review/text: This product is both sweet and has a sharpness. I've been putting it into hot water and I find that it does the duty of a peach flavored tea but there is much less of a tea flavor. Much of it feels like juice on the tongue but it's a little sharper and more citrus-like than what I initially expected. Regardless, I do find it to be an excellent drink and hope to indulge in it for years to come.

Not too much tea flavor, as is the case with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4HUMY">MIO Sweet Tea, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> I tried recently.  The Mio Liquid Peach Tea turns the water a color similar to the peach color on the bottle and will stain a white shirt if you're unlucky and sloppy like me with the occasional dribble from an unclasped straw!  This is one of the better Mio flavors, but my favorite it still <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4FUGW">MIO Berry Pomegranate, 1.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>.

review/summary: OK Taste.  Fuzzy-Peachy Flavor.  But Also a Chemical Taste.
review/text: The MIO Peach Tea flavor is definitely a fuzzy, peachy flavor and, if you put too much flavoring into the water, your tongue will feel more fuzzy!  Seriously, this flavor is just plain bad.<br /><br />The flavor also tastes chemically, and, after looking at the ingredients, it is easy to see why - the ingredients are entirely chemicals.  This product also contains sucralose, a sweetener that some want to avoid.<br /><br />Verdict: if you want flavored water, are looking for an enhancer, and the chemical list doesn't bother you, the MIO bottles are something to look at.  I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4HUMY">MIO Sweet Tea, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> over the Peach Tea because the Sweet Tea has a smoother flavor.<br /><br />Edit: my teenagers were excited to try this product because of TV advertisements.  One squirted a healthy dose of flavoring into her water & promptly stated that the peach flavor tastes like chlorine.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: If you like to control the flavor and sweetness of your water, then this works out very well.  I like my water slightly sweetened and flavored and mixes are always too strong.  The rest of my family likes it that way but I always have to dilute mine down by at least 1/2.  The MIO Liquid gives me control, glass by glass how much sweetened flavor I desire.<br /><br />I'm not sure what they mean by 24 servings per 1.62 oz bottle, since you can squirt big squirts and little squirts.  Just be sure to aim your squirt directly into the glass and not do what I did.  I accidentally shot a squirt over the glass and onto my child's homework.  It left a very dark stain.<br /><br />It tastes good - just like peaches.  So, if you like peaches you will probably like this.  Artificial sweetener makes it low cal, which is always good since most of us are constantly trying to cut calories here and there.  And if it gets spilled it's not a sticky mess to clean up.  Good stuff.

review/summary: Good - but not my favorite flavor
review/text: Being a water-hater all my life, the invention of MIO was a dream come true for me. After several bottles of experimentation with the other MIO flavors, I've found 3 squirts in a liter of water is perfect. I thought at first the Peach Tea would be one of my favorites. After several glasses of this, it's good, but not a favorite of mine like the berry/pomegranate, it reminds of a cheap peach wine from the 80's.

review/summary: Tasty Flavoring for Water
review/text: I reviewed the Mango Peach and the Peach tea flavoring and I like this flavoring better.  The taste is more attractive than the other MIO flavor I tried.  It is very sweet and can be used to taste and I enjoyed it enough to have two glasses this evening.  One thing that consumers should know is that it does have an aftertaste that is common with some low calorie drinks.  I don't care for that flavor too much but I felt that this flavor overcame the aftertaste enough for me to enjoy my drink.

review/summary: Eh . . . Peach Tea In A Squeeze Bottle . . .
review/text: I was hoping to like this, at least a little bit. Essentially, its a small squeeze bottle you can carry in your pocket and squeeze into water to flavor it. It does flavor water well, but the flavor is just not appealing. Here's what I don't like about this product:<br /><br />* NOT TEA. I get the peach flavor, but zero tea flavor. I guess it has some born food coloring.<br /><br />* Way too sweet. If you want flavoring like this for your water, you could get the same effect carrying around Kool-Aid mix in a plastic ziplock.<br /><br />* Look at the ingredients. Nothing real. 0% juice.<br /><br />If you really, really need to drink your water flavored and you happen to need it to come out of your pocket and you like overdone artificial sweeteners, this is the product for you. I don't get it . . . it's concentrated Kool-Aid in a squeeze bottle.

review/summary: Okay in Small Amounts
review/text: I'm a regular drinker of powdered drink mixes. I really like that the Mio concentrate is liquid instead of powder. There's no need to trouble yourself for minutes shaking/stirring to get a powder dissolved - everything's ready to go with one quick swish of a spoon or shake of a bottle.<br /><br />I wasn't struck by any particularly bad artificial flavor/chemical aftertaste upon first sip. But with each additional sip I took, some weird taste was building up unfavorably in my mouth as well. By the end of my 8 oz serving, I was convinced I would not be buying more of this product (at least not this flavor). The taste wasn't exactly chemical for me. It tasted more like the raw bitterness you may be familiar with that you get from eating fuzzy peach skin. If I were to be juicing peaches, I would normally peel the skin off first to avoid getting that taste in my juice, but this mix seems to have captured peach skin along with the rest of the fruit. Not a bad drink to have a few sips at a time, but after a whole cup, sip after sip, the "skin" taste concentrated so much to something very unpalatable.<br /><br />I don't mind drinking this a little at a time, but this is not something I can tolerate in large quantity if I were really thirsty.

review/summary: Artificial smell, taste, just not great.
review/text: There's an odd smell to the water when this is added to it. It's reminiscent of a swimming pool, or at least that's the image that comes to mind for me.<br /><br />It tastes, well, "artificial" is the best description for it I think. It's not *bad* really, though the artificialness of it hits you (along with the odd scent) with every sip.<br /><br />It's very sweet, in a strong artificial sweetener sort of way, and it has an aftertaste that I think is a result of the sweetener.<br /><br />It's strongly colored, something that I really don't think is needed here. On the other hand if you're the sort of person who likes the idea and taste of this, then you probably need it to be bright orange as well :P<br /><br />Maybe if you had some really nasty tap-water that you were forced to drink for some reason.<br /><br />But in general this just does nothing to improve a nice glass of water in any way.<br /><br />G.

review/summary: Best tasting Mio so far
review/text: The peach tea Mio is the best tasting flavor I have tried so far. It is better than the mango peach or the strawberry watermelon. That being said the fake sugars in the drink make it very sweet tasting. I love the concept of Mio, but a healthier version, with real natural flavors and no chemical dyes or sweeteners would be so much better. It's a great concept and a quick way to make water or any liquid a quick flavored drink.

review/summary: Reminds Me Of Crystal Light
review/text: This Mio Liquid Peach Tea water additive reminds me alot of the Crystal Light packets that you pour into a water bottle, minius the clumping, harder to dissolve into water issues.<br /><br />I like this small, compact bottle, and the fact that you determine how much or how little you want to add to your water.<br /><br />Since so many people do not drink enough water in any given day, anything that will persuade you to drink more water, whether it's adding a slice of lemon or lime, or some kind of additive to your water like this is a good idea.<br /><br />One thing tho, when you first take the plastic off of the bottle, the plastic that prevents product tampering, make sure that you position the bottle over your water bottle or however you drink you water, because it will kind of squirt out.<br /><br />One small bottle is supposed to be enough to flavor up to 24 portions or whatever you want to call it of adding it to your water.  I wish it came in a larger size, but maybe it's portable size it so that you can take it with you on the go, to the office or some place like that.<br /><br />For me personally, I enjoyed this peach additive when I have used more of it than less of it, to where you can really see the color in my water bottle, it's not too light or too dark.  Iam sure it's a personal preference.<br /><br />I do drink alot of water due to the fact that the medication that I take each day does make me thristy, but it's nice to have something to drink besides plain water, tho I do know there are many kinds of waters out there, including flavored ones, but if you buy it in a large quantity, it can be cost prohibitive, not to mention harder to carry and lug around.<br /><br />I like that this Mio product comes in a pack of 4 instead of just 1, but I wonder if they also make a mixed assortment pack, so that you can try different flavors, which would be a good way to keep things interesting, to have variety from day to day.<br /><br />By the way, upon reading the front and back of the bottle, it says on the front of the bottle that it has natural peach flavor, with other natural flavor, and on the back of the bottle it shows zero for everything, but it does contain sucralose, which is instead of sugar.  I kind of figured that this product would have some kind of sweetener, which I wish it were sugar, or else this product would taste kind of sour.  The comapny who makes Mio is Kraft Foods.<br /><br />Lets face it, nothing is going to taste like a peach, a real peach, but a real peach in it's natural state.

review/summary: Useful
review/text: This egg-sized container of concentrated flavor/sweetener is much easier to use than powdered drink mix.  This bottle is strong enough that it doesn't accidentally open, and the drinks mix almost instantly with very little swirling or stirring.  In fact, if you just squirt it in before you finish filling your glass with water, there is no need to stir.<br /><br />The flavor of this peach tea iteration is my favorite.  My spouse says they have an aftertaste like many diet drinks, but I can't taste one.  I think I'm relatively sensitive to artificial sweeteners, and find this to be a lot more palatable than most diet drinks.  However, you can still tell it's not real sugar (it's sucralose, aka Splenda, and acesulfame k).<br /><br />I often like very, very mild flavored water, so I need just a very short squirt.  This thing will last me two weeks if I drink twice a day.  The twenty dollar Amazon pack will last me two months.  That's a much better deal than most competitors that will taste good.<br /><br />I also like this for camping because it mixes well, masks the tastes of field purified water, and importantly, leaves no residue like powdered drinks do.<br /><br />It's one of those neat little products I know I'll actually be buying several times in the future.

Yeah, not really peach tea but still tastes pretty darn good. They say 24 uses but I probably got only 15 or so since I either wanted my drink a little sweeter or used too big of glasses.<br /><br />The current price on Amazon suggests more than five dollars a bottle. I think that is pretty steep but I would probably purchase some more individual bottles to try other flavors.

review/summary: A little flavor or a lot, the choice is mine
review/text: I've been using MIO in my water for quite a while now. I like that it allows me to give my water that something extra, so that it makes me more inclined to get my daily intake of water in. Additionally being able to choose how much or how little flavor you add is nice too; me I found that with most of the flavors I like 2-3 quick squirts in my water bottle which holds 24 ounces. I decided to try the Peach Tea flavor because Mango Peach is my favorite, with Sweet Tea as a close second and this one now falls somewhere in between. For some the taste may be unappetizing and I admit at first I wasn't sure I liked it, but it grew on me and now I use MIO on an almost daily basis.

review/summary: Great Taste, but Artificial Sweeteners
review/text: I was leery of the concept of Mio, but decided to try them anyways.<br /><br />Have tried quite a few different flavors, and the peach tea is by far my favorite.  It reminds me of the crystal light or lipton artificial peach tea.  It may be slightly artificial tasting, but I have grown to like that specific flavor, and enjoy the Mio one as well.<br /><br />A couple of issues that I have with Mio.  The first being it usually artificial sweetener, this allows the calories to be nothing, but ultimately could have other issues.  The second is that this seems to trigger heartburn for me after drinking it, not so pleasant.  The last is that if I get a glass with ice in it, if I put the Mio in first it gets trapped, if I put it in last I need to stir my drink, dirtying a spoon, and maybe spilling it all over the place.  Not a huge issue, but can be annoying.  Crystal Light, etc you make it once and then don't deal with it anymore.

review/text: Alone this makes a pretty good peach flavored drink, which is OK.  However, what I found that I like it better for is to actually brew some tea (doesn't matter what kind, as long as it's not an herbal tea with some other fruity flavor) - then add this product to the tea!  THEN it tastes like a really good peach tea.  I'd recommend using it that way a lot more than just adding it to plain hot water.  Of course, that means you still have to brew tea.  So, this product, used the way I like it, isn't more convenient than making tea, because I still have to do that.  However, the FLAVOR of it when added to the tea is VERY good.  I recommend it very highly as a tea additive.

review/summary: One way to wean yourself off soda
review/text: If you're trying to wean yourself off of sugary drinks, this could be a good option. The fact that it's a squirt bottle means you can use as much or as little flavoring as you like, and gradually step down the amount you're adding. It's also a small package you can carry around rather than ending up buying soda or over-sweetened water drinks.<br /><br />On the minus side, I don't really detect any 'tea' flavor, just peach. On the plus side, I didn't detect any unpleasant aftertaste, but perhaps that's because I wasn't using a large amount--just a single squirt in a glass of water.<br /><br />One thing I do wish they'd do is skip the acesulfame-K and just use sucralose for the sweetener; sucralose is generally considered safe, whereas acesulfame-K is not. Probably won't be drinking it on a regular basis for that reason.

review/text: When I read the reviews for this and tried it myself and thought it was not bad as others mentioned. I still wouldn't choose this over Crystal Light peach tea or Snapple peach tea. I think it needs more tea flavor than peach. It is a little sweet but even by using a little squirt it still taste a little sweet compared to the competition. The down side to this is the shelf life after opening. It is best to use it within 30 days of opening. Like Crystal Light and Snapple I eventually get bored of the flavor. I always have flavor varieties on hand and the MIO might not last in the shelf. What I like about the MIO is the portability. As far as the flavor goes it is not bad. I can drink it as it adds flavor to water. They do have other flavors that I prefer.

review/summary: Best of the MIO line yet but still not as good as Crystal Light flavors
review/text: I was really exxcited about MIO when it first debuted as a product and even got in on the giant facebook free sample bottle giveaway.  I've tried 4 flavors now including this one, the Peach Tea and this one is the best so far.  I like the IDEA that you can control how much flavor you add to your water but so far MIO just hasn't mastered  the concept that Propel Zero has of addingh flavor essence without intense sweetness or aftertaste.  It's a clever concept which is why it get at least 3 stars from me and it IS convenient.  Other folks on my household have liked it better than I have and carried it with them to work.  The 4th star is becuase this is the best flavor we've tried.  The other flavors would just get a three because the aftertaste is stonger in them.<br /><br />The bottom line is this:  MIO has a cleverly executed and well-designed product but they have yet  improve on their two major competitors Crystal Light or Propel Zero in bottles.  They are trying to be both and I think that's where they fail.  If they want to be a flavor essence, I feel they should ditch the colorings.  Any of the red colors will almost always have a bitter aftertaste to a large sector of users due to the red food coloring they use.  This Peach Tea  tastes somewhat peachy and somehwat like tea but not enough of either for me to give up my occasional pitcher of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9U6">Crystal Light Peach Tea Drink Mix (12-Quart), 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> or buying the individual bottle sachets(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ53K6">Crystal Light On The Go Peach Tea, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>) when they are one sale and have a coupon.  They have captured the loyalty of many water drinkers so I'll give them credit where credit is due.  I just don't feel it's the best value for the money they are charging.  I wish I could give this 3.5 stars.

review/summary: An easy way to drink more water
review/text: Mio Peach Tea is a quick and easy way to add flavor to my water. Whenever I feel like I need some fluids, I grab a big glass, toss in some ice, fill it up with tap water and squeeze some Mio flavor in it till the color looks good. In fact, sometimes I want it stronger than other times, but I'm in control. I don't have to make up a whole pitcher, and I don't have little packets to deal with. Open, squeeze, close and put it away. Easy and no mess; I like it!

review/summary: Fake Tea Made Easy
review/text: MIO liquid tea is really easy to make and tastes like fake peach tea.<br /><br />Don't expect brewed tea taste. If you are a tea drinker then you probably are accustomed to the fake tea taste is like.  This is it. Not a bad version at all.<br /><br />I have been filling a liter sigg bottle with cold water, shoot two squirts of this into the bottle, screw on the cap and shake.  Done.  Go back to my desk.  Drink the whole bottle in an hour. The drink is rather tasty when you want something other than water or pop.

review/text: It is very easy to make a nice cup of caffeine-free drink with this product. Just add few drops into a cup of water and it tastes great. The flavor is fine, and the delivery method is simple. You can adjust the amount of stock depending on the size of the cup. It is convenient to carry to the office. You can also use small portions, if you don't want to make a whole pitcher of tea; recommended!<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P83JMU">The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Coffee Liquid Extract, Regular, 33.8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000T3KTJA">Tazo Tea, Spiced Black Chai Tea Concentrate, 32oz</a>

review/text: Good design on the container. upside down it won't spill. You must squeeze and on my first try it dispensed a small stream. enough to flavor a 20 oz bottle. You can vary the amount with practice. The Peach Tea taste (my choice) was very nice. I don't like Sucralose, but that aside, it was pretty good. I recommend it, Unless you dislike the aftertase of artificial sweetners.

review/summary: Tastes just like Crystal Light, but you get to control the strength of the flavor.
review/text: Plain water alone can be pretty boring, and if you're burned out on adding lemon or lime then an option like the Mio line of water enhancers is a solid choice for making your drink more exciting without switching to something less healthy like soda.<br /><br />The peach tea flavor tastes almost exactly like the "Iced Tea with Peach" Crystal Light variety, so if that particular sugar free drink floats your boat this one will equally tickle your fancy.  What's great about Mio is that you can add as much or as little as you like to each individual glass of water, so you are in total control of the strength of the flavor.<br /><br />Unfortunately that can also be its main drawback, as it's easy to go through a bottle of Mio much more quickly than a package of Crystal Light or an equivalent powder-based drink. Even if it does go faster than other options, I still recommend giving it a try if you want a new sugar free drink and like a light peach taste.

review/text: This version of the water flavor enhancer has too little flavor for too much money.  My husband took half of the bottle to work with him to use during his breaks.  He said he used the entire half bottle in one regular bottle of aquafina water.  It gave it so little flavor it just made it undrinkable.  I would buy other flavors of the MIO but not this one!

But the stuff is great.  It's super affordable, and way cheaper than trying to buy flavored water.  The Peach Tea flavor reminds me of the stuff my mom made years ago.  I'll definitely be purchasing some more, and checking out the different flavors.  Highly recommended.

review/text: Nice peach tea taste made with Sucralose (which I like, Aspartame and Nutra Sweet products give me headaches).  This is not a powder mix, so the concentrated liquid mixes with water very easily (you almost don't have to even mix it).  Great taste for a diet product, and you can mix in the exact amount of your liquid to suit your own taste.  I like that you can even slip a little into your glass of water without making an entire pitcher of the stuff (not like most packet-based products that force you to make a quart of the stuff). A nice product if you like peach tea.

I'm afraid I don't have anything good to say about this product.

review/summary: Very Compact & Very Convenient
review/text: I got this for my girlfriend who always buys the powdered tea mixes.  She usually buys the individual packets that you add to a bottle of water.  After buying several boxes I realized she was leaving boxes at work, my house, hers, etc.  Then of course, she would run out at one location and 2 boxes at another.  I thought this would make a convenient way for her to carry a large amount in a small package.  Now she can carry up to 24 servings in her purse.  To me, that's very convenient.  She mentioned that the taste was about the same.  My only complaint is that you have to be very careful with the liquid.  They have very concentrated dye in the liquid, so don't let it drip on the carpet or your clothes.  It's much harder to clean than a drop of actual tea.  All and all though, I was extremely satisfied with the product.

review/summary: Marvelous, especially with added lemon juice
review/text: I'm a water drinker and I still drink a lot of it straight from the filter. But water can get boring...it is nice to occasionally use an enhancer to add some zest. At various times, I've tried all the commercial products out there. None come close to matching the flavor and convenience of MiO. This is truly an original and outstanding product and it has become a regular part of my food life.<br /><br />I'm an extremely health-conscious eater. I eat a mostly plant-based diet of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. I grow a large portion of my own veggies and buy the rest from local farmers' markets. I try to avoid processed food and cook almost everything from scratch. MiO's ingredient list shows artificial colors, sweeteners, and preservatives...so you might wonder why would I even consider drinking it. Well, I don't use that much and I don't worry about this one little misdemeanor in my pantry. My diet is so healthy in so many other ways that I consider MiO a small indulgence.<br /><br />I've tried to go natural with water enhancers--for example adding pomegranate juice. But truthfully, it is not nearly as flavorful and far from convenient or cost-effective.<br /><br />What I frequently do use to make my MiO drink more healthful is to squeeze a real half a lemon into it. The artificial sugars used in MiO are so strong that they sweeten the lemon, too...and the lemon enhances all the MiO flavors. Lemon is extremely healthful! I could fill up this review page with medical and nutritional information showing the beneficial qualities of lemon juice. I've known about this for a long time but rarely fixed lemonade for myself because I dread using all the real or artificial sugars that it needs to take away the intense sourness. The artificial sugars used in MiO are 600 times sweeter than sugar...they do the trick with a little squirt and nothing more added. So, by using MiO with a half a lemon squeezed into it, I find that I am drinking more liquid per day than I did before I discovered MiO and I am incorporating lemon juice into my daily diet. In the balance, MiO has been a health improvement.<br /><br />Yes, I am aware of the propylene glycol used in this product...but it does not cause me great concern. I am more fearful of coming into contact with bad chemicals from insecticides, common home cleaning products, factory-farmed meat and fish, and the tons of processed foods that I avoid when cooking my own meals from scratch.<br /><br />Taste is a matter of individual preference. I keep all the flavors on hand for variety's sake, but seem to prefer the Berry Pomegranate and the Mango Peach.<br /><br />The MiO bottle is a marvelous invention that should win some kind consumer prize. There is a double-locking lid and little membrane over the opening. The membrane creates a tiny vacuum within the bottle as you squeeze, so you'll never fear dripping the contents on clothes, carpets, or tablecloths as you remove it from your glass. The double-locking lid is so secure that I have no fear carrying a bottle in my purse.<br /><br />My personal wish list for MiO is that they'd remove the artificial coloring. That would make is more healthful and not detract from the flavor in any way.

review/summary: good-bye snapple
review/text: I love the peach tea flavor.  At the grocery store, one Snapple is nearly the same price as one Mio.  I actually end up getting more out of the Mio than a case of Snapple simply because I can control how much I want to drink in one serving whereas sometimes I end up throwing half a Snapple away.  I haven't noticed any chemical taste or smell like some of the other reviews.  It's also great how this Mio has no calories or sugar so I love it when I need a water replacement.  However, I wouldn't buy this product on Amazon it's far less expensive in the store.

When I go to a restaurant, I order a glass of ice water, which is free, and add my own flavoring without any extra calories.  I use it everywhere.  One of the waitresses at a casino thought it was a great idea when she saw me adding it to my little bottle of water.  It is hard to find in the stores these days........guess because it is so popular.  Be sure to get all the flavors.  My spouse loves the sweet tea.........no calories and excellent taste!

review/text: I've tried a few MIO flavors, and this is my least favorite. The after-taste, well, it's like pool-water. That chlorine-bleach taste. It also tastes a little Peachy. I guess the accurate description would be "Peachy/Bleachy" - seriously. If you like the Peach taste and don't mind the overly artificial taste, you'll like this. Personally, I'll take a pass on this flavor.

review/summary: Too expensive
review/text: Others here have reviewed the taste. I am in agreement that it is "chemically" and cloningly sweet.  Others have compared it to other products like Snapple, Crystal Lite and Arizona Teas.  How is that possible?  Its not at all a competitor to any of those products.<br /><br />My main problem with this product is it is grossly overpriced for something out of the chemical labs of Kraft. Sure, on a per-drink basis it may be cheaper than a prepared bottle of any of the above, but consider that it is ... 1.6 oz of chemicals in a little plastic container.  Way overpriced.<br /><br />Several people expressed that they like flavored water and this is convenient for adding flavor to water anywhere they go.  That's what earned it the second star.  The concept is one of convenience and Mio score okay on that.  I don't mind drinking plain water so there is no major lure for me.<br /><br />If you like such a product and don't think paying $18 for four 1.62 oz containers is too much, there's no reason for you not to try it out.

review/summary: A delicious treat
review/text: Well, since some other user decided they'd paste their review on to each flavor allow me to give my short but sweet review:<br /><br />MiO is delicious. I like that I can just put in the tiniest of splashes in my drink and just have a hint of flavor... or splash a lot in and get a real flavorful experience. It's a quick and easy thing to use. It's also fun to watch it splash into the water. I've also found it's good to flavor different types of alcohol.<br /><br />In regards to the criticism by other reviewers for it containing propylene glycol - don't be in a panic like them. propylene glycol is harmless unless ingest massive quantities of it. Using a canard like "it's considered harmful to pets so humans shouldn't ingest it!" is just alarmist behavior. Chocolate is harmful to dogs. Better not eat that then!<br /><br />Lastly, in regards to it having so many "food colorings" - well, if you don't like anything that flavors your water to have anything artificial in it, squeeze a lemon into it. Put a dash of sugar. Or just drink the water plain. You know what you're getting into when you buy this stuff.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is my new favorite drink flavoring. I will be buying from them again and again.

review/summary: Concentrated flavor
review/text: Kraft Foods Global has come up with the new product.  MIO Liquid Peach Tea is not tea.  It is actully highly concentrated peach (tea) flavored liquid that can be mixed with (bottled) water.  It comes is a portable plastic package that can be easily carried around.  This small bottle does not need to be refrigerated once it is open and it can last for 30 days once it has been opened.  Only a small dash of flavor is needed in the 8oz size cup.  Drink does not have caffeine or any other enhancers.  It is a new fashionable way to flavor one's water. You will not be adding any minerals or vitamins to your drink.  This is also not the energy drink.<br /><br />As far as innovation goes, this is a great product and a smart marketing move.  Personally however, I would rather buy already flavored bottled water, that spice up my own.  But of course this is simply a matter of personal preference.  Other consumers may feel differently.

review/summary: matter of taste, I guess
review/text: I think all diets I've tried say "drink at least six or eight glasses of water a day". The problem is I HATE water out of it's natural habitat. I've tried all the tricks and can usually make it for a week or so then I slide back to getting my daily quota of water from a cup of coffee.  I already drink sugar-free soda and I don't know what real peach tea tastes like so I don't have any negative comparisons. I use just enough of the MIO to kill the taste of the water and I like it so far. I'm hoping the positive hydration will out-weigh the intake of more artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Afterthought: This is a "water flavoring" , nothing more. No juice, no nutritional value. Don't expect something like iced tea or Kool-aid. It just adds a subtle taste to your water. If you're used to diet soda and artificial sweeteners you won't mind the taste. My sample had a non-removable label over the ingredients so you will have to check other reviews for that.

review/summary: Peach Tea MiO
review/text: I've been curious about these MiO Liquid "Water Enhancers" so I tried the Mango Peach flavor, Sweet Tea and now Peach Tea. It comes in a cool little bottle with a flip lid and non drip type nozzle. So, if you were so inclined, you could easily carry one around in your pocket.<br /><br />About two quick squirts into a bottle or cup of water (I prefer a bottle so I can shake it) is enough to flavor your water. The Mango Peach was nice and fruity and the Sweet Tea tasted really like Sweet Tea but this one, Peach Tea, falls somewhere in the middle and just doesn't quite spark my taste buds like the others.  Still good but not my favorite.<br /><br />One item of note is that these are not health products. They do not have vitamins. They only flavor water. I just wanted to mention that because I was not sure myself before I tried one.<br /><br />So it's a cool little product and if you drink a lot of water and want some flavor in it you could do worse. And it is portable and lasts a pretty long while. I'd certainly try some of the other flavors.

review/summary: Actually a good tasting faux peach ice tea
review/text: This product by MIO is a water enhancer.  Basically it is concentrated juice-like substance that gives water a different flavor.  The flavor of this enhancer is "peach tea".  The application is pretty simple, fill a glass with water and give it a squirt or two and then stir.<br /><br />As for the taste, well it is pretty good. The flavors of peach and ice tea blend very well together.  In addition, there isn't any odd aftertaste. Also a little goes a long way; at least it did for me.  Nevertheless, someone could certainly use more to give it a more bold taste.<br /><br />There are plenty of people who refuse to drink water (I for one love water).  This product might promote the consumption of H2O.  I have been keeping this little bottle in my lunch bag at work.  When I fill up my 20oz cup with water I give it a little taste of peach tea.  Overall, this is a good product and I am eager to try some of the other flavors MIO has to offer.

review/summary: Good, but I'll stick to my CL flavors
review/text: I was pretty excited to try this out, what with the rows and rows of MIO flavors staring at me on the shelf as I purchased my occasional pack of Crystal Light. I love adding things to water, but I'll admit that at times the packets will either be too much or too little, depending on the size of the water bottle. (And not all of us wants to carry around a partially opened packet of drink powder that always seems to want to empty out into the bottom of our purses.)<br /><br />Convenience-wise, this is pretty awesome. You can add as much or as little flavoring to this as you like, so if you like a very strong peach tea flavor, you're covered. Like it a little weaker? You can do that too. It's all liquid so it mixes together pretty awesomely as well. No clumps of powder in the bottle or cup that need to be shaken apart. (Which means no clumps of powder hitting your teeth if you're not willing to let the drink sit until the powder dissolves.)<br /><br />It's unfortunately not the best tasting stuff I've ever had. It's just a little too artificial tasting for me to really like it as much as I wanted to. I wasn't expecting miracles from this drink and I knew that it'd taste at least a little chemical-ish, but this is just a little off putting. It's good enough to where I'll drink it, but it's just not the best as far as peach tea goes. However, if you're on the road and can't get real peach tea and don't want to go the powder route, this will be your best bet. It's still better tasting than some of the artificial stuff you find in various drive-thrus.<br /><br />I am curious to try some of the other flavors out there in the MIO line and I have a feeling that I'll enjoy those far more than I have this pack.

review/summary: Chemical peach flavor anyone?
review/text: I thought the idea was a good one, I drink a lot of water. I'm a Diabetic so I'm always looking for more flavor where and when I can find it. Unfortunatly this tastes just plain bad to me, I squeezed a healthy amount into my cold filtered water and wow the first thing I noticed was the strange chemical smell. Then after tasting it, it  really was a sweet artifical flavor, very chemically not at all like good diet peach ice tea like AZ Ice Tea or Snapple. That's the flavor I was hoping for really. I tried it again and I just can't use this stuff, what a pity because I really wanted it and needed it be good. I would have been a customer if I liked it at all. I could not even give this a two star, I just thought it was that bad.

review/summary: I love MIO.. as a cleaning agent!
review/text: Let me start this by saying that I have tried multiple flavors of MIO in varying concentrations, and while the taste is somewhat bearable, I'm just not a fan of its aftertaste and artificial flavor.  I'm writing a review to let potential buyers know of its alternative use!<br /><br />When I moved into my new home about 6 months ago my husband and I were disappointed to find that the kitchen sink was badly stained.  It was made of white porcelain and appeared as though someone had poured blue ink or dye down the drain.  It coated the sides and pooled at the bottom and left a ring around the drain.  It was quite unsightly.  For the first month we tried several cleaners, including bleach, peroxide, magic erasers, comet, goo gone, paint thinner, ammonia, CLR, and tile cleaners.  We planned on replacing the sink entirely, mostly due to the chips on its surface and our preference for stainless steel, but the blue stain did play a part.<br /><br />As if by magic the solution came to us.  One afternoon I discovered that a bottle of MIO in my pantry was leaking.  I removed the bottle and placed it in the sink til I could check to see where the problem was coming from.  I cleaned up the mess on the shelf with little problems, amazed that a concentrate like that didn't stain the shelving!  When I returned to the sink and lifted the busted bottle I discovered that an oval MIO shape had been formed in the blue stain.  It was like applying a Crest white strip to my sink!  I then began to pour the concentrate all over the sink.  No scrubbing, no pain, no effort.  I simply turned on my faucet and watch MIO strip away the blue ink that had plagued me for 3 months as I rinsed it down the drain.  I contemplated how or why this worked.  Citric Acid? Malic Acid? Propylene Glycol?  Which chemical was to blame for its magical dye stripping properties?<br /><br />Beats me!  But to be honest.. I certainly don't want to drink it any more.  It can bleach porcelain better than.. well bleach.  So why on earth would I put it in my body?<br /><br />Hope this saves you from chemical cleaning of your digestive tract, or if you need a great spot remover... give it a whirl.

review/summary: Better Than Plain Ol' Water
review/text: This stuff tastes just fine.  That is, it tasted just like I expected it to taste, which is the taste of artificial peach flavoring.  I'm used to this stuff in other drinks, in teas, in candy, so I know what it tastes like, and this product delivered perfectly on that taste.  Now, does it taste like I've squeezed a totally ripe fresh peach into my water?  Well of course not, and you'd be a fool to expect that.<br /><br />The product is officially "peach tea," but I really didn't taste any tea flavor at all.  It's got that brownish tea tinge once you get it mixed up, but the only taste I was getting was peach.<br /><br />I asked my 15-year-old daughter (a core prospective demographic, I would think) what she thought of the product.  Her first reaction was that it tasted like "chlorinated pool water."  Ouch.  Tasting it with that description in mind, I could see her point; there is something in that slightly astringent peach taste that can be interpreted as chlorine-like.  If you are thinking that way, you'll taste it, but if you're thinking peachy, then that's probably what you'll be tasting.<br /><br />Water is better cold than warm, but even at room temperature, this product made water a more enjoyable experience.<br /><br />The unit price is pretty good, at around five bucks.  That seems like a lot for such a dinky little package coming in at least than two fluid ounces, but it's touted as being able to flavor-up 24 bottles/servings.  That's something like 21 cents a serving, which you're never going to see at your work cafeteria or local convenience store.  That being said, our family certainly didn't get 24 servings out of this package.  It was more like seven or eight.  There is no way to measure how much you're squirting into your water, and the depth of color (light v. dark) once you stir the mixture in doesn't really help that much, at least in terms of flavor.  We did learn that more Mio in the glass doesn't really make the flavor that more intense.<br /><br />And, for the hydrological experimenter among us, this product is lots of fun to use.  Get your bottle or glass of still water, and put it in drop by drop, and you've got fascinating lines and curves, which move ever so slightly in the water.  Psychedelic, man.  Drop this stuff in from a height, and it's even more fun.  Squirt a huge shot in all at once, and the action is really good, your own potable lava lamp.  And then, get that water going in a tight vortex and drop your Mio in--very cool.  (Add a laser pointer into this aqueous exploration, and you might just see God looking back at you.)<br /><br />The cap locks down tight, which is a good thing, if this product really is going to be dropped into a purse or a backpack for rockin' hip and youthful on-the-go Mio-nization of your drinking water.  Even if the cap comes up, the dispensing nozzle is valve-like in its operation, which means you've really got to squeeze your little Mio bottle to get that concentrate to come out.  That was smart packaging.<br /><br />I did do a stain test on this stuff, as its color is a deep, crimson, salmon-blood red.  I put a couple of drops on a white dish towel, let it soak in and then dry, and then washed the towel.  The good news: all traces of the stain were completely gone.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is not going to give you the fruit-flavored tea experience that you'll get with a powdered mix.  Its taste is slightly artifical, but in general is not bad.  It's a neat advancement in the hydrate personalization.

review/summary: Alternative if you are trying to cut sodas/colas
review/text: If you are already drinking healthy/natural/organic beverages, as many other reviewers have pointed out, this has a number of artificial ingredients, so you probably want to stay away from it.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are like me and are or have or had been trying to cut back and eventually cut completely the soda and cola addiction, this can be helpful because it is not addictive like the Colas and it is very quick to prepare, so you can counter the cravings (for worse things) before they build up. It only takes a couple of seconds to squirt a little in a glass of water and then add ice if you prefer. I do only one squirt per drink, press and release, not press and hold. It is small enough you can take everywhere.<br /><br />The taste is reasonable considering what it is and what I use it for. It obviously tastes nowhere near as good as fresh peaches or freshly brewed tea.<br /><br />Having said that, I only use this occasionally to counter cravings and such. I don't think it is a good idea to drink this on a daily basis. But if it can stop you from running to the soda vending machine at work or grabbing a 2-liter cola from the convenience store, it is a small victory.

review/summary: No stale taste for me
review/text: If you ever doubted that people taste things differently, just look at the reviews for this product!<br /><br />I had tried only the Mio Strawberry-Watermelon before picking up this product at my local WM. I was very skeptical because I love restaurant flavored tea, but have never tasted a commercial instant-tea product that I considered drinkable, including Snapple, Lipton, name brands, off-brands, you name it. They all have a stale chemical taste that I cannot stand. So until now, I've either brewed my own or done without.<br /><br />So with tremulous hand I added this to some ice water and hesitantly brought it to my lips - to be pleasantly surprised. It's not as good as Olive Garden's peach bellini iced tea, but it doesn't have the stale taste that has put me off of most brands, and I found it quite acceptable. The peach flavor is not as strong as I would prefer, but it is there. Like others, I wish Mio would quit adding artificial colors.<br /><br />This isn't my favorite flavor, but I will be keeping it among my sugar-free aspartame-free water flavorers for when I feel like tea.

review/summary: Great for making water tasty! :)
review/text: I drink a ton of water anyway due to a variety of medical "issues" that require me to stay away from sodas, juice, alcohol, etc. Needless to say, water is my go-to drink whether I like it or not, and truthfully I've gotten used to it, but every once in a while I just need something to make it actually TASTE LIKE SOMETHING. I was using the powdery mixes for a while, but now I'm loving MiO. I like that you can control how much you add to the water without wasting. If you just want a little bit of flavor, you can squeeze in only a few drops, or if you're a person who really wants legitimate iced tea, then squirt away! The flavor is delicious too. It definitely tastes like iced tea with a nice helping of peach and doesn't have an artificial flavor in my opinion. I'd absolutely buy these again, particularly this flavor.

Sadly, the product is not as good as the idea. The problem is the taste. I have tried various tea products, including Crystal Light, and have generally not been too impressed. Sadly, this MIO stuff tastes very artificial, and not at all pleasing.

review/text: I don't know if they've changed their formula - when MIO first came out, I bought the three or so flavors that were available and found them all to be pretty good.  With warmer weather approaching I bought a few more and was drinking my ice water with the Peach Tea formula and nearly spit it out.  At first I thought the drinking fountain water or the ice from the ice machine at work had been sanitized a bit too thoroughly, but then I smelled the MIO container and was surprised at how much it smelled like bleach.  Undrinkable.  Even diluted in water, the smell is extremely strong.  Is there a problem in the formula?  I've not compared it to the other flavors but doubt that I will be buying any more based upon this...too bad, it's a more convenient package than the powdered sticks.

review/text: I was not such a big fan of the taste of this tea, but I have to admit that the convenience provided in the concentrated little bottle is a big plus.  You can take it and flavor your water wherever you go and it fits easily into a purse or pocket.  I do prefer the taste of Arizona iced tea powders, though--but those require making larger batches of tea at a time.  The biggest drawback of the MIO tea is the ingredient list--it's got propylene glycol (anti-freeze) and artificial colors --which I try to avoid.<br />The ingredient list is as follows:  water, malice acid, propylene glycol, citric acid, and less than 2% of natural flavor, sucralose and acesulfame potassium, potassium citrate, red 40, yellow 5, blue 1, potassium sorbate.  And despite it saying "natural flavor with other natural flavor" on the front--you'll have to note that on the back it says 0% juice.

It worked ok for that purpose although he made it too sweet.<br /><br />I do like the liquid peach tea idea, and the flavor is very good.  We took it on a camping trip where we used it to flavor the bottled water we had brought, as it is easier for the kids to stay hydrated if there is a flavor that they like.  Sometimes they'll drink plain old water and sometimes they need some encouragement, which Mio provided.<br /><br />It will take each person who uses it some time to get it right... my wife preferred the least amount of drops, and the children the most (duh).<br /><br />I do prefer it to the various powered additives.  So, 4 stars.

review/text: I love the idea of Mio. The bottles look cool, and now that so many people are trying to drink more water, Mio offers a chance to drink water without, you know, having it taste like water.<br /><br />I love actual peaches, and Mio Peach has a lot of peach flavor and color, which is great.  My only criticism is that, IMHO, Mio Peach is way too sweet.  If I flavor the water lightly, it comes out as lightly peach flavored and heavily sweet, but if I go any heavier, it's super-sweet.<br /><br />It uses sucralose for sweetening, and various other colors and flavors, so if you're sensitive, be careful.<br /><br />I don't think I'll be buying more Mio Peach myself, but if you like peach and have a sweet tooth, give it a try.  (But definitely don't buy a four pack until you're sure it works for your taste.)

So there's an idea if you have some or decide to try it an aren't happy with it in just water.

review/summary: Peach in an artificial sort of way, also super sweet
review/text: I'm glad that Amazon offers the MIO product because I have been curious about it - I grew up as a die-hard soda drinker who's trying to ween off the stuff, and lets face it, water just tastes too boring sometimes. I was hoping that the MIO might be a good way to bridge that gap. Unfortunately for the Peach flavor, it's pretty "meh" on all accounts. There is very little peach taste, and what is there tastes very artificial - like what you imagine the scientists thought peach should taste like, but couldn't figure out exactly how to get there. I was also surprised by how sweet it is - even just a few drops in a pint glass and it tasted super saccharine to me. The sweetness also has that hallmark flavor that most sugar substitutes have - that sort of strange, chemically Equal/Sweet n Low taste.<br /><br />Honestly, if you're a water drinker who just wants some sweetness or flavor in your drink, I still think the little plastic honey bear is probably the best bet.

One family member's squeeze colored his whole glass of water orange and gave his water a sticky sweet aftertaste, like several dozen Sweet Tarts had melted into it. My one squeeze left a few peachy tendrils floating in mostly clear water and made it taste like someone who ate Sweet Tarts an hour ago had backwashed into my glass. Neither was pleasant. If there were supplements in the drink and I was getting enough vitamins in the sugary sweet mess to, say, eat another In-N-Out Double Double and not feel as guilty, I'd choke it down. As it is just basically food coloring with flavor, I would not drink this on purpose again.

I tried to give MIO the benefit of the doubt and feel as though my preconceptions stand true.<br /><br />While the idea of a non-crystalline water additive is novel, the taste has to hold up to standard otherwise it's a waste of money.  MIO liquid peach literally tastes like metal and smells like bad cough syrup.  I could not get through a whole bottle without cringing so I just dumped it down the drain, rinsed out the bottle, and drank good ol' fashioned, calcium-laced North Dakota tap water.<br /><br />Yum, yum.

The suggested use in the instructions don't make the perfect flavor.  It is a trial and error process.  The tea blends are harder to get perfected but the peach tea comes close.  It's obvious that the flavoring is artificial.  Seriously, it's on a store shelf. It does not require refrigeration.  To knock it down for artificial flavoring is insane because it's plain as day what it is, right?<br /><br />With that being said, it's decent.  Now that I've tried the mango peach flavor, I probably won't be buying this flavor.

I will try another cup later today and see if I think it's better.  It's possible I didn't use as much as I should, so I should factor that in and try it with some more.

review/summary: Splenda sweetener, nothing beneficial about this water enhancer
review/text: Don't be fooled by the fancy delivery mechanism and the take as much as you want campaign.<br /><br />Sucralose is the main sweetener (Splenda).  Artificial sweeteners can cause the body to release enzymes that break down food more completely in your gut, giving you more calories that you would if you had nothing sweet.<br /><br />Given that the Mio Liquids have no other benefit, no C, no B, no D, no Calcium, just a lot of ingredients that are manufactured in a lab, well, I will stay away and not order again.<br /><br />Mine is in the trash.<br /><br />That said, if you don't care what you put in your body, the taste is not bad.

review/summary: disappointing because it doesn't taste like tea
review/text: I find this whole line disappointing, perhaps, for no other reason than I expect this  to taste like tea. Sadly, it tastes like colored water.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I'm a foodie who likes the finest tea. I do not drink Lipton under any circumstances.<br /><br />If you like tea that's not very good, this might be an acceptable product.<br /><br />Also, I still believe this would be an acceptable addition to undrinkable water as it would mask the fogginess of the water.

review/summary: Big taste in a little bottle
review/text: I must say I was somewhat skeptical about the MIO liquid peach tea at first.  But, after trying it out for over two weeks, I actually really like the way it makes water tasty to drink.<br /><br />First off its very concentrated and a little really does go a long way.  You really just need a few drops and one bottle will last a long time.  The tea is best prepared on the watery side with just a faint hint of peach but whatever your preference is, you can attain after you get a sense of how powerful the a little amount really is.  I think other reviewers here are frequently mentioning a chemical like taste because they are drinking way too strong.  Its not Snapple folks..<br /><br /> I aslo like how small the bottle is as you can take it just about any where.

review/summary: I can't believe I like this... a lot.
review/text: I am a recovering Diet Pepsi addict and have been clean for a few years now. I then started my staple of Polar seltzers with "essences" of flavors. Carbonated water with a hint of orange, lemon, even vanilla.  But then considering all the money I have wasted on Diet Pepsi and soda, I then started drinking tap water with a little Splenda and lemon juice. I would buy the concentrated lemon juice and just use a little.  In other words, I have been drinking water more than anything else.  I did remember seeing this MIO stuff, and never thought twice about it.  Then took the time to try it. My only option was this Peach flavor, and it would not have been my first choice, but I really enjoyed it. 1.62 oz does not seem like a lot, and it is a small bottle, but for me, a couple drops in (filtered) tap water gives me that "essence" flavor effect.  I noticed people were talking about aftertaste etc. but I think it may be due to using too much of it.  It is so highly concentrated, so I would imagine the strength would be overwhelming.  With a few drops of MIO in water, simply means I will drink more water. And drinking water is boring, so this is the remedy.  The only problem I see here is that it's not very easy to order.  Keep in mind the MSRP is only 4 bucks, and currently all I see are third party merchants inflating the prices, as usual. Why MIO is promoting the product and not supplying it is beyond me. Once Amazon is stocked, then it will be a better price with free shipping. I will be buying more, but not until it is fulfilled by Amazon.

review/summary: Great idea, ok taste
review/text: I drink a lot of bottled water as my well is constantly acting up. I was given one of these to eval and thought I would give it a try. First of all, the review with this acting as a cleaning agent kind of weirds me out a bit and now I am tempted to give it a try. If it cleans my sink stains better than my commercial cleaner then the rest of this bottle is going straight in the trash.<br /><br />I thought this tasted worse than peach Lipton Tea, and I hate peach Lipton Tea. I gave it 1 star for portability, 1 star because it performs as described - flavoring tea and I gave 1 star because it did not make me sick. Needs a flavor overhaul, but I think about any peach in a bottle is going to taste a bit fake.

review/summary: Great concept but peach flavor is underwhelming
review/text: Overall, I like the idea of the MIO line.  I have found that it helps me drink more fluids throughout the day and it breaks up the monotony of constantly drinking water.  I was slightly disappoint in the "peach tea" flavor in that it was a little too complex and it was hard to find a balance where I could taste it but it didn't become overwhelming.<br /><br />I was impressed by the number of servings that I got out of the container (it's labeled as being a 24 serving container, but I found that I got at least twice that).<br /><br />The container that MIO comes in is extremely portable.  I was able to put it in my jacket pocket without fear of leaks (the container actually has a valve to prevent leaks and spills).<br /><br />While I am not a fan of the peach tea flavor, I will definitely buy MIO again simply because of its convenience and the fact that it does make me drink the amount of water I should.  I calculated the price to be less than 10 cent a serving which is really hard to beat considering the alternatives.

review/summary: So portable!
review/text: If your like me and hate water, even bottled water, then this is a great portable water enhancer. Like the other flavors it does have a certain taste other than the flavor that is consistant in their product. Can't really describe it but it doesn't really bother me either. I do like adding it to my water bottle when I take the dogs out to the nature preserves for a very long hike since I can't stand water. I do recommend the other flavors to this one though. I love sweet tea infused with real peaches and this is not at all close to the real thing in my opinion, more like close to a kool-aid flavor. Still RECOMMENDED.
