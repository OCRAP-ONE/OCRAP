So far, it's the only coffee I've used in my Keurig where I changed the size of the cup so that I had more water.<br />Perfect for Monday morning's or travel mugs!  Daily coffee I prefer something not quite so strong.  My housemate added hot water.

review/summary: disappointing
review/text: You may be wondering what is disappointing about a four star coffee.... This is a better than average brew, reasonably strong while not bitter (so no robusto beans), but the flavour, if "intense," it is not particularly rich. If you love Timothy's Rainforest Espresso & Parisian Nights, this coffee is not in the same league. It is similar to Green Mountain's bold roasts.

Interestingly, their Donut Shop is fantastic -- if you like Coffee People (and you can't beat the prices here on Amazon), I'd go for that one.

review/summary: yick-- too bitter!
review/text: I originally tried the variety pack that came with my Keurig and it had the Bold Organic from coffee people which was excellent-- I went online to buy some and saw all the great reviews for Black Tiger which steered me to buy it instead of the Organic. Boy, what mistake-- it was VERY bitter and I was stuck with two boxes of it!  If you like your coffee with a bite then go for it.  This is bitter even at the mug setting. If you like your coffee smooth avoid this like the plague! After two months of trying to use this up, I'm finally finished with it. I was the only one in my family that would go near it-- it was like swallowing a bitter pill every day.  Never again! I thought I should warn those out there from being swayed by bitter-coffee lovers.<br />David

My husband does, and he brews a medium size and a small size from the same K-Cup (with our Keurig B60,) into his travel mug and he's good to go. For me, it's way too bold.  I've since ordered him the Timothy's Columbian and he likes it even better - a bit smoother and more mellow taste, but not weak.  My preferences lean toward flavored blends.

review/text: I drink my coffee black and prefer the bolder, stronger k-cups.  I don't like the french roasts or the other dark roasts, but I do like my coffee strong.  After having tried many different extra bolds, Coffee People's Black Tiger and Gloria Jean's Black Gold have become my favorites.  I alternate between the two of them and sprinkle in Green Mountain's Sumatran Reserve now and then which is also very good.

review/text: This is a bold coffee which I bought based on another review.

Tastes differ so if you like a strong, dark coffee, try it - it may be just the one for you.

review/summary: Yeah !!
review/text: *THIS* is the stuff right here!<br /><br />I had been going through a ton of K-CUP varieties trying to find a really good, strong coffee. I'm a bit of a coffee-snob and most of the K-CUPs I tried just left me saying "Meh... It's 'ok'. Not terrible, not great just 'ok'."<br /><br />Even the K-CUPs marked 'extra-bold' left me wondering who decided this coffee was even deserving of the name "slightly bold", let alone "extra bold". I usually found myself using 2 K-CUPS, and running the small cup size twice just to get 1 decent cup of coffee - and even then the flavor just wasn't quite "there" (to me, they always taste "old", as if someone ground halfway-decent beans but then left it out open and exposed to the air overnight to spoil.)<br /><br />.. and then I picked up some Black Tiger.. Yeah!!! This is the *only* K-CUP I've found so far where I can choose the 12 oz brewing size and still get decent cup of coffee that doesn't taste like someone rinsed out my cup and served me hot water instead of coffee.<br /><br />Now even as such, this coffee is *still* not nearly as good as the cup of coffee that I can get with my good old french press using coffee that was roasted 2 days ago and ground 2 minutes ago. Sorry, ain't no way a K-CUP is going to get you that level of coffee. Ever.<br /><br />However, this variety is still darn good for a K-CUP and definitely deserving of my morning cup of coffee! (coming from me, that's saying *alot*!)

review/text: Tiger Black is certainly a decent coffee with a bold flavor that will definitely perk up your day. I've just found that it's not to my personal taste; I don't like dark roasts as much as mediums, such as another flavor by Coffee People called Donut Shop. This is because the dark roast flavor overpowers the cream I use, while the Donut Shop is a good balance that I will gladly have every day.<br /><br />Don't let that discourage you: if you like dark roasts, this one may yet become one of your favorites.

review/text: This is probably the best coffee made for the Keurig single serve brewer. Bold statement, I know, but this is one bold coffee that stands apart from the mediocre "Green Mountain" blends that Keurig offers. This is a strong, in your face, wake you up, no holds barred coffee that I wish they made available in whole bean bags (or even pre-ground, it's that good) just so I could take it with me for when I didn't have my Keurig. The only downside is that it can get a little expensive, especially with how addictive it is to drink.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this coffee for anybody that like to flower up their morning brew with sugar, cream, sweeteners, or heaven forbid those awful flavored creamers.<br /><br />If you like good coffee, drink this and you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Written while sipping a cup of Black Tiger coffee.

It is strong and smooth and my go-to when I need the caffeine kick-in-the-pants. I hope they never stop making this product.

review/summary: Harsh
review/text: This coffee is burnt tasting.  Like burnt toast.  The burnt taste overpowers the other flavors that may be there.  Not much coffee flavor detectable, reminds me of and old fashioned large percolator, after several hours, only more burnt tasting.  I have not had this problem with any other K-cups.  This one, Black Tiger, stands out as the worst tasting.  Adding milk added will not mask the overwhelming sour, bitter and chalky flavors.  I have tried it several times over the past 2 years, so I think I have sampled a few representative "batches."  My wife, who prefers the darkest roasted coffees, consistently complains about the taste, and drinks it only as a last resort.  She drinks a lot of coffee, and I see her point.<br /><br />Try any other brand, Donut Shop, Dark Magic, French Roast, any other brand is much more drinkable.  Maybe some folks appreciate the burnt taste.  If you like the taste of burnt toast, then you might like "Black Tiger."

review/summary: Black Tiger Extra Bold K-Cups
review/text: Being a coffee lover, I have found that many of the K-Cup offerings are a little weak for me. I tried a few of their Bold Coffees, but when I found the XBOLD - Black Tiger, I stopped looking further. And I was much better off buying through Amazon as the price was better than retail or via Keurig.

review/summary: My Son Loves This Coffee
review/text: I bought this coffee for my son who loves his coffee stronger than I do and he loves it.  He said the flavor was very good and I will be buying more.  After he uses one of these bold black tiger k-cups he leaves it for me and I use it a second time and it is very good for me and not as strong which I like so this has worked out for both of us.  Would definitly buy more and recommend if you like your coffee more on the strong side but not bitter.

I do recommend a tea strainer.  I thought about it when amazon suggested it as a package deal but did not at that time.  I will order the strainer on my next order for this tea.  I also found that this tea kinda acts like an appitite suppressant also.

review/text: My dog Yogi is still a big chewer, he's a little over a year, but still wants to chew just about anything.<br /><br />These chews are heavier and thicker than average chews including Pedigree Dental Sticks. As thick and heavy they may be to chew through, he goes through it in about three minutes, which is a long time for him. So far this chew outlasts the others.<br /><br />My veterinarian approves this treat.<br /><br />I am just glad my dog enjoys them and gets out some of his  persistent chewing tendencies on them.

review/text: We have a wonderful German shepherd in our family.  She's happy and affectionate and a wonderful companion.  Exactly the kind of dog that one enjoys rewarding for her good behavior.<br /><br />And our dog, Asha, seems to look at 7.4 ounce Jumbones as something to which she is entitled.  In short, she loves these treats! She weighs more than she should, so perhaps we are being overindulgent with her, but she loves these so much that it's hard not to provide a supply to last the week for her.<br /><br />For me? I don't know how good these really are.  But, trust me, my dog loves them.

review/text: We have 3 beagles with very powerful chews and 1 tiny, incredibly hyper chihuahua who all love these. The beagles gobble them up so fast they simply disappear - no crumbs, no mess, nothing. We cut it up into smaller pieces for our bouncing-off-the-wall chihuahua, and he's content to sit still for an afternoon to gnaw his bit of Jumbone. I only wish they lasted a bit longer with the beagles, but its not easy finding a lasting chew for their teeth - at least they enjoy these!

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: This is an excellent purchase.  I am glad I ordered this one.  With it holding 35 K-Cups it holds a wide variety of flavors.  The size is just perfect to fit inside my cabinet and with it being on a revolving base, I do not have to worry about pulling it out to get what flavor(s) I need.

review/summary: Keurig k-cup Carousel
review/text: Love this carousel!  Holds 35 k-cups and looks great.  It is handy, and convenient.  Glad I went for the larger one. Keurig has a 27-count holder, but I wanted the quantity.  Comes in black or stainless look.  I chose the black.

review/text: It does what it says it will--it holds k-cups and does a fine job of it.  It spins.  That's about all I can say.  It hasn't dropped any coffee that I know of.  It hasn't fallen apart.  Two big plusses in my book.

review/summary: Great option for displaying k-cups!
review/text: We got this k-cup spinner yesterday, and so far, so good!  I previously kept all the k-cups in a large bowl, but we got tired of digging to find the one we wanted.  The item was well-packaged, already assembled, and was made of quality components.  I was concerned that it would be flimsy, given the low price, but I am glad I took the chance to order it.  It takes up less counter space and is taller than the 27-cup model, PLUS it is cheaper.  It spins easily, holds lots of k-cups, and we are very pleased.  I would recommend purchasing this if you have a mess of k-cups!

review/text: I bought this because I had a boatload of accumulated k-cups and they were starting to look tacky sitting on my counter in boxes. After it arrived (which was super fast, thank you once again Amazon), I unpackaged and set it on my counter - that was it. It looks great, spins well, and the cups all fit perfect. It has made a really nice addition to my kitchen and I'm very pleased.

review/summary: IT DOES WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO...
review/text: Really not much to say.  It holds the k-cups and spins freely.  Unless you spin it around like a carousel on crack, I don't think the k-cups will be flying out.  The footprint is reasonable, about a 7" diameter.  It is sturdy enough and doesn't feel cheap.  It also holds the Solofill refillable k-cups.

review/summary: Know your buying profile
review/text: Product is as described on the website.  If you are going to purchase this product, it helps to understand your buying profile.  The stand looks very nice and attractive when filled with product (k-cups).  However, it looks kind of silly when less than 3/4ths full.  Additionally, it's a nice way to display a variety of coffee flavored k-cups.  So if you are a person who plans on keeping the stand replenished with a variety of flavors, you will like this carousel.  If you're just buying one or two flavors, it's more cost effective to just use a bowl.  For me, it is perfect since I often have visitors and this is an attractive way to display all their coffee and tea choices.

review/text: Nice product. I spent the money on a 35 K-Cup carousel and was sent a box that had a sticker identifying it as a 35 K-Cup carousel. When I opened it, it was not what I expected. It was only a 27 K-Cup Carousel! Had I wanted that one, I would have ordered it (and spend less money). Was disappointed that I did not get the item that I wanted. I am a frequent Amazon.com shopper and this was the first time I've received a wrong product.

review/summary: K-cup problem
review/text: The coffee itself was pleasant though not great ... part of the problem might be that the cups only "work" half the time. There is no sure way to line up the top of the cup - no mark or notch - and many times you only get about 1/3 of actual coffee in your cup, requiring a 2nd or even a 3rd try to get a full cup. We got them at a decent price but it's not worth the aggravation.

review/summary: Love it.  Just ordered a second one.
review/text: I originally ordered this for my husband's k-cup style coffee pods.  I like the larger size (35 pods) compared to most carousels out there, especially since I tend to order the pods in larger quantities.  It fits easily under my upper cabinets and looks nice beside the Cuisinart coffee maker.  Since it's taller but not wider than other carousels, it makes maximum use of countertop space.  After using it for a couple of days, I've ordered a second one for tea and cocoa.  It was only a few dollars more than the 21-slot version at my local BB&B and I got free shipping.  Happy buyer here.

review/summary: Disappointed in quality
review/text: We decided to buy this carousel rather than the one made by Keurig because it held more (35 vs. 27) and because it was taller and narrower, thereby taking up a smaller footprint.  The down side was that it is generally more expensive than the Keurig version, but decided to make the additional investment for the above reasons.  However, when we received it, it wasn't as well-made as we had hoped, mostly because it didn't stand straight, so when you spin it, the "leaning tower" rotates annoyingly from side to side.  Decided to live with it rather than dealing with a return.

review/summary: One of the BEST K Cup Holders!!!
review/text: My husband and I purchased our first Keurig this month, which of course meant we also purchased a good number of k cups as well, thus leading us to decide that it might be nice to get something that could not only nicely hold a large amount of the k cups but also be a way of showing to guest possible drink options. We have several friends who also own keurigs as well as different types of k cup holders. We felt that after seeing and hearing their opinions on some of the k cup holders and seeing some of them first hand, we decided we wanted one of the carousel types.... 1. because we felt they were built better 2. They did not seem to fall apart as easy and seem to be of nice, stable structure 3. they seemed to display very well a variety of k cups all while making them easy to get to and use.<br /><br />We did not want to go with the smaller Carousel version, because we wanted one that could hold a large amount. We did have some reservations at first about this model, however all of our nervousness was put to rest once our carousel finally arrived. It is not only sturdy and well built, it also spins smoothly when it is turned, no parts were broken and it can display up to 35 k cups at a time! WE LOVE THIS CAROUSEL!!! It was worth the money spent and we are certain will hold up for many years. It is easy to access the diff k cups, it looks great on our counter next to our keurig and soda machine, and it is also not too tall so that it easily stores underneath our cabinets without issues!! Highly recommend this product for those consumers wanting a larger k cup holder, that is sturdy, well built and great to use!!!! 5 stars from these two happy consumers!

review/summary: Keurig K-Cup Carousel
review/text: Good product.  Keeps my single-serving K-cups organized and near the coffee maker.  One complaint is that the product arrived with one spot weld broken free.  It doesn't affect the operation of the carousel and I was able to bend the metal just a bit to keep it in place, so I'll just live with it.
