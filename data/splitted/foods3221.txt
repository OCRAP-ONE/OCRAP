review/summary: Great for sensitive tummies
review/text: My cats both have food allergies and they were throwing up even Purina Naturals.  After one of them developed diabetes, a moderator of a Yahoo group for feline diabetes steered me towards this.  We have had virtually no dietary problems, the occasional oops but not like before.  They also seem to have less feces, which is a sign of a good diet.  We have purchased 3 (15lb) bags since being informed of the P&G buyout, I have not noticed any differences but it may be hard to tell until the stock made by the previous manufacturer is exhausted.  In the meantime, I plan on sticking with this food.  I would like to try the Sweet Potato but don't want to buy such a high cost food and then find out they don't like it.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: This is what we found after Science Diet discontinued their lamb and rice formula.  One of our cats is allergic to fish and corn, so we settled on this because we couldn't find anything else without those two ingredients.  Well, lucky us.  It's the best cat food we've ever used.  All of our cats like it.  Our cat allergic friends have fewer problems with our cats than any others.  We rarely see hairballs anymore.  The cats are prettier and fluffier than ever.  Great food.  Hope it never changes.

review/summary: Best food for upset tummies
review/text: If you have a cat that has not been doing well, stomach wise, try California Natural.  Ingredients are simple - chicken and rice.  No corn, no soy, no yeast no anything that your cat could be allergic to.  I had gotten a kitten and his stomach was not happy for almost one year.  After numerous testing, different medications over the course of 8 months, my vet finally said maybe it was his food - I even went to a different vet for a second opinion. Second vet also said it could be his food.  So, I started looking at ingredients in different dry cat foods and looked at California Natural - minimal ingredients so less for the cat to get sick on.  Turns out this food worked for my fur baby and he's now 7 years old and doing great.

review/summary: Great for all cats, even sensitive stomachs
review/text: I have 2 beautiful wonderful kitties, but one has a sensitive stomach. It was a nightmare finding the right food but im so happy it is this one, not something with filler and something with better quality food, my pets health/life is more important than a higher priced cat food. She used to have problems but since switching to this food, no problems with the litter box and no hair balls, been months now and we finally have her healthy, along with her brother who was very small and grew a lot with this nourishment! I would highly suggest this brand for a more natural food for your pet! It is the only thing my little girl can tolerate besides human baby food chicken flavor, but together i know they both get the nutrients they need and they dont gorge on it ever resulting in a happier life for all of us with no intestinal upset!

review/summary: Better Than Amazing Grass Chocolate
review/text: I had been using Amazing Grass Chocolate Greens Superfood for quite some time now.  I wanted to give this brand a try since it was on sale this week at my supplement store.  I bought it on a whim and am very glad I did!!  Once purchased, I mixed some in my water bottle and drank it down before I started the car.  Instantly I felt perkier which was great because it was 4pm in the late afternoon and my daughter was wanting to go swimming.  Been taking it now for three days and I'd like to add that I'm even more regular?? TMI, but good information for those who care.  I feel better on Amazon Chocolate than I did on Beachbody's Shakeology!!!  Will purchase again!!!

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: I predominantly use Dr. Shcultz Super Food cuz nothing that I've found compares with the levels of nutrition that he manges to get into a single serving. Since it very expensive I tried some other things to supplements with. The taste of this products doesn't offend me at all, but I'm not crazy about the slight stevia flavor. I don't find it to be all that chocolaty either. I like to put a small amount of water and mix this with a frother to blend it really well and give it some bubbles. I then add a bit more water cuz if you use the frother with the water too close to the top it will spray out everywhere. No fun. I love it this way, it makes it seem almost creamy.

review/summary: Tastes great and gives me more energy
review/text: I've tried this, Amazing Grass Chocolate Greens Superfood, and Athletic Greens, and all of them are excellent in terms of an energy pickup and making me feel healthier.  This one probably tastes the best (it's a tossup with the Amazing Grass stuff), and the Athletic Greens maybe a little better on feeling noticeably healthier, but they're also more expensive and I think they taste weird (my husband likes them better on taste; go figure).  The 'wild berry' flavor of this is strange (I like it okay after a handful of tries; my husband doesn't like it at all). The chocolate flavor is more bitter than Amazing Grass but I like it more (it's more chocolatey).

review/summary: Coffee, Chocolate, Cookies... WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?!
review/text: If you like coffee, chocolate & crunchy cookies, I can give you my personal guarantee that YOU WILL LOVE THESE COOKIES!<br /><br />In 2004 I introduced a new cookie concept that was really my husband David's idea. Responding to requests to add cookies to our line-up of wholesale coffee shop desserts, I decided on a cookie that could be dipped in coffee (but not like biscotti). David jokingly suggested, "why don't you just put the coffee into the cookie instead of dunking the  cookie into the coffee?" Mmmm, not a bad idea, I thought.<br /><br />But this proved to be easier said than done. The most challenging part was to get that "just dipped in a latte" flavor, that has now become our hallmark. Coffee flavoring was just too bitter. 14 months of experimenting later, I formulated a specially designed wet cookie dough that would allow coarsely ground espresso beans to actually "brew" into the cookies as they slowly baked. Finally! A chocolate chip cookie that truly tastes like you dunked it in a freshly brewed cup of French Roast coffee... soon named "The Chocolate Chip Espresso".<br /><br />I then added different flavors to eventually produce a line of cookies that reads like the menu board in your favorite coffee shop:<br /><br />"White Chocolate Vanilla Latte". Our signature cookie & best seller, made with Madagascar vanilla, REAL white chocolate pieces & bits of espresso beans.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3BG">White Chocolate Vanilla Latte, 5.25 ounce boxes (pack of 4 boxes)</a><br />or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3AC">White Chocolate Vanilla Latte, .09 ounce, 2-cookie single-serve packs (box of 24 packs)</a><br /><br />"Almond Mocha". Made with just the right blend of cocoa, milk chocolate chips, almond flavoring & espresso bits.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3B6">Almond Mocha, 5.25 ounce boxes (pack of 4 boxes)</a><br />or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3A2">Almond Mocha, .09 ounce, 2-cookie single-serve packs (box of 24 packs)</a><br /><br /> "Cinnamon Cappuccino". A snickerdoodle powered up a notch with chocolate chips and coffee bits.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3BQ">Cinnamon Cappuccino, 5.25 ounce boxes (pack of 4 boxes)</a><br />or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3AM">Cinnamon Cappuccino, .09 ounce, 2-cookie single-serve packs (box of 24 packs)</a><br /><br />"White Chocolate Mocha Latte". A rich mocha cookie with REAL white chocolate chips and espresso bits.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3CA">White Chocolate Mocha Latte, 5.25 ounce boxes (pack of 4 boxes)</a><br /><br />And of course our first-ever espresso cookie: "Chocolate Chip Espresso". A buttery, classic chocolate chip cookie super-charged with bits of espresso beans.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3C0">Chocolate Chip Espresso, 5.25 ounce boxes (pack of 4 boxes)</a><br />or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3AW">Chocolate Chip Espresso, .09 ounce, 2-cookie single-serve packs (box of 24 packs)</a><br /><br />AMAZON EXCLUSIVE -- and a great way to try several flavors at once! Try a "Mixed Box" that comes with 6, 2-cookie single-serve packs of each flavor: Chocolate Chip Espresso; White Chocolate Vanilla Latte; Almond Mocha; & Cinnamon Cappuccino.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N39S">Mixed Flavors, .09 ounce packs (box of 24 packs)</a><br /><br />Java Bites Espresso Cookies quickly became the ONLY product that we manufacture. Until now they were only available through gift stores, specialty food stores, coffee shops, and gift basket companies. In response to numerous emails requesting that we sell direct to the public, we are pleased to now offer them through Amazon.com.<br /><br />I hope you will let us become a part of your "healthy indulgences"!<br /><br />Leslie Estes

review/summary: Natural wheat bran, high fiber cereal
review/text: I don't usually go out of my way to write reviews for anything other than music, but I will for this cereal. It is a very underrated cereal that I believe can help pave the way for a better diet. I eat it everyday at different times and not only do I always feel satisfied that I chose a healthy alternative, but the taste is INCREDIBLE! One of my favorite tasting cereals hands down. Sometimes I even just eat a handful dry if I'm in the mood for a dry food. Not only is it a good source of fiber (10g, or 40% d.n.) but it's also packed with essential vitamins. With only 80 calories per 1/2 cup, I say yes to All-Bran every time!<br /><br />(Hahaha sounds like an ad, but it's so true)

review/summary: My favorite cereal
review/text: All-Bran has been part of my breakfast for quite a number of years, and it's the only cereal I use these days. Of all the cereals commonly available at grocery stores, this one has one of the highest amounts of fiber and the least sugar. Yes, there are some that claim a higher fiber content but they are also loaded with sugar. All-Bran tastes OK the way it is, but let me share what I do to make it taste exceptional.<br /><br />First I add some skim milk to my cereal, and then a teaspoonful or two of sliced unsalted roasted almonds (I buy mine at Trader Joe's - good stuff and the best price you can find anywhere) and about the same amount of Plum Amazins (you can use any bite size pitted prunes). So we've just added more fiber, potassium, iron and all kinds of naturally good stuff to our cereal - and tons of taste. I then place my cereal bowl in the microwave for 20-30 seconds, and out comes an incredibly healthy, tasty and satisfying breakfast. Try it!

review/text: It actually does taste really good. Moreover, after exercizing, I ate about a handfull (dry) without water. Filled me up immediately, which is the important thing for me is that the fiber functions as it is supposed to. Kashi's cereals didn't cut it for me in that respect, as much as I love the idea of the protein / fiber combo that they've got out at the moment.<br /><br />One person posted a lot about HCFC in this product, which is a concern for me too, but here's my perspective as someone who stays away from HCFC 99% of the time when I have a choice.<br /><br />Just to point out, there's 10 grams of fiber per serving and 6 grams of sugar. That means there's only 4 grams net carbs per serving. A single serving can (12oz) of regular Coca-Cola has 39 grams of sugar. (And even that overload is 'only' 13% of one's daily carb intake, technically.) A serving of this cereal has 80 calories and only 4 grams of net carbs, plus when I just bought a box in my local store I didn't see HCFC on the label. (I looked for that specifically.)<br /><br />So it is possible that Kellog's has changed the formulation on this food. I laud your principled eating, OGO et al, but for those who can't afford (or are ignorant of) alternatives to this product, it is a favorable choice above Raisin Bran, for example, or another favorite among people I know, Fiber Plus "Antioxidants" which has twice as much sugar and the same amount of fiber. All nutrition choices are individual, and peoples' needs and desires vary.<br /><br />At the same time, I wholly agree that HCFC is a horrible, horrible substance. When choosing things to eat, I want to know if it's included, just the same as I want to know if Aspartame is in my drink. However, my choice to consume this product is that of an informed consumer. I opt to purchase this product (5 boxes for less than $20 is the dealbreaker for me, a huge savings compared to other similar cereals such as Kashi or my personal favorite, F-Factor Skinnys (not available on Amazon at the moment, about which I am sad!)

review/text: My go-to almond milk for smoothies (because I prefer a commercial product to what I make) is Blue Diamond Unsweetened Vanilla. However, the half-gallon Almond Dream Unsweetened was on sale at a price I couldn't say "no" to, so I bought one despite the fact that it seemed to have more ingredients ("gellan gum?!") and calories (not a problem) than Blue Diamond. What, I reasoned, could I lose?<br /><br />Bad move.<br /><br />I noticed while pouring that Almond Dream Unsweetened seemed to have somewhat more body than Blue Diamond (which has the consistency of cow's milk) but I didn't think too much about it--who, after all, doesn't like a thick smoothie? Unfortunately, my morning smoothie, usually delicious and with all other ingredients the same, tasted like chemicals. CHEMICALS. And chalk. It was impossible to pull all the flavors together and while it wasn't undrinkable, it was by no means enjoyable. An EXTREMELY disappointing purchase.<br /><br />The manufacturer has been successfully marketing their Rice Dream amazake-like frozen desserts (they have some slammin' non-dairy/no-sugar-added novelties) for many years but, unfortunately, "rice smarts" are no assurance of similar results with nuts. Perhaps their chocolate, sweetened almond milk is better but I'm disinclined to find out because I will NEVER buy Almond Dream almond milk again. It's back to Blue Diamond for me.

review/text: I love these cookies, they are very good. I saw them in the international food isle and had to get them.. btw they are totally 79 cents at my grocery store for the exact same thing you're getting on here and I live in NC.. so I'm so glad I didn't have to buy them online. They are best dunked in your hot tea or coffee if you're looking for a stronger flavor. :)

review/text: Was looking for a substitute for (Christie) Social Tea, and thought these might do it. Nope. Too sweet, too much (fake) vanilla flavoring, and they can barely handle a dunk into a cup of tea before crumbling. I hoped for them to be like Christie Social Tea biscuits...but they might be just like the American counterpart. If you want something like Canadian Christie Social Tea biscuits, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Not bad but not great
review/text: I actually bought this product at a local Smart and Final supermarket in my area (namely, Los Angeles and specifically in the Lincoln Heights community) and I'll be honest, it's not too bad for instant cappuccino. Now, I'm not a coffee snob or a coffee connoisseur but I have worked in coffee retail for 4 years previously (Seattle's Best Coffee at a local Borders Bookstore back in the days when Borders was still around [now defunct and its trademark and intellectual rights sold to Barnes and Noble]). Given that, I know a little something about coffee relative to the average coffee drinker.<br /><br />To clear out some misconceptions though, the only difference between a cappuccino, espresso, and a cup of coffee is the amount of water used and how finely or coarsely grounded the beans are. Otherwise, it's all just "coffee." Caffe D'Vita's cappuccino is more like "coffee" with a very heavy creamer and artificially-sweetened French Vanilla taste. No additional sweetener required. The French Vanilla taste is rather addicting, in my opinion. It makes you want to drink more of it at a time but the caffeine content is low so I wouldn't recommend it as your daily morning caffeinated drink.<br /><br />I use about 6 tablespoonfuls of it in a mug of roughly 10 ounces. Any less seems to give it a watery, milky taste that doesn't even taste like coffee. The bitterness is more pronounced with less tablespoons. Otherwise, it's not bad but not great for instant cappuccino. If you want something with more caffeine, I'd suggest looking at other instant cappuccino mixes than buying this one. I hope this was helpful.

review/text: Been drinking this beverage every am ,for about the last 5 yrs. Its decaffinated and I happen to like that fact, plus it has a light, creamy taste to it and not bitter. My recommendation is for 3 tsp. into a 6oz. cup and that suits me just fine, however, each and every coffee drinker has their own preference, so go by your taste. I highly recommend this product and it can be served chilled, as an Iced Blended Cappuccino. I buy this product by the case and find it outstanding. Iam not a coffee afficinatdo, just a person who enjoys this product any time of day. Yes, I have had this late at nite, and it didn't disturb my sleep habits one bit. I do add an addition coffee creamer to my beverage, as I like it hot and steamy and with an additional creamy taste to it. Try it and see for yourself?<br />kkw

review/summary: First time I've actually enjoyed Flaxseed meal.
review/text: Tried Flaxseeds in all different forms. I will say I do like the dry roasted ones but there so small they got annoying to eat.  I don't mind the taste of regular grounded flax seed but a little too much on and it's over powering in taste.  This combination with berries makes to me the perfect tasting food.  Bought them last night, opened up the bag cause I was anxious and the aroma was great and very fresh smelling.  So I had two spoonfuls straight up before bed.  Makes a decent semi-sweet treat cause of the berry taste.  Drank a lot of water to wash it down, which I shall warn anyone new to flaxseeds, drink lots of water (to avoid dehydration or too much going to the bathroom), unless it's the dry roasted kind.  Had a good nights sleep. Woke up feeling good and my morning dump was effortless (thank the fiber content).<br /><br />Now for the best part.  Had a spoonful or two in the morning as well as put some on my oatmeal. I have had this energy and focus all day. Got my work done earlier than normal due to focus.  My body is kind of craving more.  Bottom line, the tastes mix with berries makes this easier to eat straight up with no loss of benefits. It's only been a day or two, but after many bouts of trying flax before, I feel like I found the right combo and can finally enjoy the benefits that come with eating them.

review/summary: Incredible, delicious and miraculous!
review/text: Ok, "miraculous" might be a little over the top for most but in my case, I'm sticking with it! I add it to a Greek yogurt each day... sometimes twice as it is so good. The past few years since having my one and only child, I could not get rid of the nasty "H" ("hemi!") that just wasn't fun having. Since eating this daily, it's GONE. I've changed nothing else in my diet or daily routine so I attribute this to the Spectrum Ground Premium Flaxseed with Mixed Berries. I keep it sealed tightly in my refrigerator and it stays very fresh. Don't let the idea of taking flax seed be an unpleasant issue. It tastes great on cereal or, as I mentioned, in yogurt. Though I buy almost everything I can on Amazon, I did find this particular product to be cheaper at my local chain drug store on the bottom shelf by the pharmacy. I almost missed it so look closely! TRY IT! You'll be so glad you did! :-) P.S. You can go to Spectrum Organics' website for a couple of yummy recipes using this as an ingredient too!

Make sure you are getting the restaurant size when you order as otherwise you might get tins.  Not all sellers carry the larger size, which is important if you will be cooking a lot of ribs (for instance).

review/text: This is probably a lifetime supply of saccharin, but I always want to have it with me when I travel, so if there's any left over, my heirs can have it. I think it has a shelf life of about 500 years!<br /><br />More seriously, as a diabetic travelling to South Asia countries, I've found it's always best to carry my own sweetener, and saccharin takes up less space than any other. I often go for three months at a time, and a package of 250 envelopes of sweetener would turn into a bag of suspicious white powder by the end of my travels, so this works out really well for me, and it's extremely inexpensive.<br /><br />Delivery was very swift and the product immediately useable. It dissolves in either hot or cold liquid, so it's as good for lemonade as it is for coffee.

Most of the stores I frequent have ceased selling it due to the massive advertising campagins of the newer stuff like Splensa which I think is extremely high priced, or now Stevia.  Will continue using my saccharine tablets!

review/text: My father has been a diabetic for over 50 years and has used this product almost continually. But in the last few years it has been difficult to find in the local stores. He found an address for the manufacturer and ordered a box. I'm not sure how much he paid, but he was very happy to find his favorite product. Finding this and ordering for him was a very nice surprise and I will be ordering more in the future.

review/text: While this form of sweetener has been around a long time, it is the most convenient to use.<br /><br />1. Its shelf life is much longer than powders.<br />3. It does not dry out or get stale, like powders.<br />4. It is much easier to use than liquids, which often drip either too much or too little.<br />5.

review/summary: Most Convenient Sweetner
review/text: I have used Necta Sweet for many years and it I use it exclusively at home and usually carry some with me.  It is unfortunate that they do not offer a small portable pocket dispenser like the one I found in Austria some years ago (and still use) because that is by far the most convenient way to carry these small tablets.  If you want an artificial sweetener, this may well be the safest one to use too since saccharin has been in use for many years by me and countless others without mishap. Moreover, with this product there are no messy little paper packages to tear up and leave on the table or have to pick up and dispose ass with other sweeteners. And this (Amazon.com)is the easiest and fastest way to get them since few if any stores carry this item.  I strongly recommend Necta Sweet tablets, and the 1,000 tablet bottle is a good way to start, with three in a package.

review/summary: Adds incredible flavor and aroma to any dish
review/text: Having never purchased smoked paprika before, I was not entirely sure which would be the best to buy, but I had heard many chefs rave about the stuff, so I figured I had better get my hands on some.  There are a LOT of different brands of smoked paprika on Amazon, so it can be really tough to know what is good and what's not good.<br /><br />Rest assured, this stuff is GREAT!  I LOVE to barbeque, and LOVE to cook ribs, pork chops, roasts, etc.. and let me tell you - THIS smoked paprika is just awesome stuff.  It SMELLS amazing.  The smokiness of it just grabs you when you first open the container, and it doesn't stop.  It adds amazing flavor to all of my grilled and barbequed foods, and brings the outdoor flavor to meats cooked indoors.<br /><br />Add a little of this, along with some black pepper and sea salt, to your ground meat for some incredible burgers.<br /><br />I've made a very tasty 'seasoned salt' using this and just a tiny bit of brown sugar with some sea salt.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but I won't.  For the price ($8.70, and free ship since I have Prime), the amount I got was FAR above expectations.  I will be buying more of this again when I use up what I bought.

review/text: My wife was really interested in trying smoked paprika after hearing it being used in several cooking shows.  We were never able to locate smoked paprika in any of the local stores, but I happened to find this on Amazon.  We enjoy it more than regular Spanish paprika.  This is the first time we ordered smoked paprika, so some of the other brands may be better.  This particular brand is cheaper than most others I've come across, however, so if you are just curious about the taste, it may be worth a buy for you.  I will agree that the flavor may get lost in most recipes if a number of spices or a sauce is also being used, but used as a simple seasoning (like salt and pepper) on simple food it is delicious.

review/text: This gum is oddly shaped, like little cubes, instead of traditional sticks or pieces. In fact, I'd almost call them "sugar cubes" instead of "ice cubes", because that's what they look like to me.  They are neatly packaged, and their odd shape sparks conversation.<br /><br />This gum has a strong mint flavor. It's soft to chew, and stays soft for quite a while, retaining its texture and flavor. The mint has a pleasant scent, and overall my mouth feels clean after chewing this gum, so I chew it often after lunch at work. It's sugar free, so it's good for your teeth.<br /><br />Like other forms of IceBreakers gum, this gum also includes the little blue particles -- which gives the gum a slightly gritty texture during initial chewing.

review/summary: Tart, Deep, Flavorful Tea with Hibiscus Flowers
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet.<br /><br />The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as "berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense". Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, juicy, red fruits".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as other teas such as Numi, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.<br />****

review/summary: Hibiscus Flowers
review/text: Researchers in Taiwan have found that an extract of hibiscus flower contains some of the same health-giving compounds as red wine and tea. Many folk medicine traditions use the hibiscus flower to treat high blood pressure and liver problems." ~Susan Aldridge, PhD, medical journalist<br /><br />The day after happening upon the idea of blending brewed and cooled Passion Herbal Infusion with orange juice, I found the lovely Tazo Iced Tea Collection. They have a recipe for Passion Lemonade and a Passion Tea Smoothie. I'm happy to blend orange juice, a packet of stevia and cooled brewed Passion tea. The taste is surprisingly good.<br /><br />Ingredients: Hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips. Lemongrass and red poppy.<br /><br />The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey.<br /><br />I do think you need two tea bags for each experience, so as to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients.<br /><br />Caffeine Free. Since the scent of orange reduces anxiety and hibiscus blossoms are said to lower blood pressure, this tea is a wonderful calming blend.<br /><br />NOTE: Many of my health/herb books say hibiscus flowers are not recommended during pregnancy. Please consult with your doctor before drinking herbal teas.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

But I found that the candies are all cracked, at least in the first tin that I opened and in one I gave to a co-worker. She swears it has affected the taste, I haven't noticed that. But it is frustrating to find the candies cracked as I can't seem to resist chewing them when that happens. I'll order them again just because they are hard to find where I live, but if the second order is cracked, that will be it for me.

review/summary: Misleading Picture and Description
review/text: This item sold and shipped by [...] is nothing like what is pictured, they mentioned x oz/jar, more like 5oz/can.  The first can I opened the pull tab came right off.  I'm no stranger to pull tabs I feed my cat from cans that are pull tabs.<br /><br />I recommend going to their site [...].  Their picture is more accurate of the product. The title of the site is "russian caviar since 2004, shipped from the USA".  Notice that this product title starts with "Alaskan Salmon", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of "Grained Salmon Caviar"  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see "made in USA" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was "sorry I was out of town".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.  However there are still inconsistencies with this product's page, that needs to be pointed out.

review/summary: Not exactly what I ordered...
review/text: As another reviewer has noted, the product description was a bit misleading. I thought I was getting four 7oz jars of Alaskan Salmon Roe. What I received was six small 5oz tins of something purporting to be salmon roe. Most of the writing on the label is in Russian, but it does say "Product of USA." This is all a bit off-putting, as we were planning to give the jars as gifts. Now I guess I'll have to open one one to check things out. The can has a stamp indicating that it was packed only 2 week ago.<br />If the product inside is any good, I'll upgrade this by a star (to 4), if so-so I'll leave it at 3 or maybe 2. If bad, the minimum one star.
