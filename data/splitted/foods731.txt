review/summary: Not good
review/text: Normally, I do not use this type of product, but, thanks to Amazon, I had an opportunity to try it.  I kept my mind open as I did not know what to expect, and the picture on the box looked appetizing.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor was barely OK, but the included broccoli package was a joke, I had to add frozen broccoli to make the whole thing decent.  I did not like the type of pasta used in this dish.  It was not the usual elbows that mac-and-cheese is most often made with.  Visually, the pasta reminded me the diamond shaped moth larvae casing.  Larger pasta would have made the texture less mushy.<br /><br />For chicken I used a day-old rotisserie chicken from Costco.  Legs have been eaten the day before, but the breast remained.  I skipped the browning step because the chicken was cooked already, added pasta, seasoning and water and proceeded per instructions.<br /><br />At some point I was instructed to add "broccoli florets".  The contents of the broccoli package were only identifiable as broccoli because that's what the package said it was.  "Broccoli" was very very dry, brown, flat, and most of it was just dust.  Thankfully, I had frozen broccoli that I added and it provided the color, the crunch, and the reasonable amount of the veggie component.  The cheese paste's flavor was good.  It melted quickly, and, once mixed in, it coated all ingredients well.<br /><br />The flavor of the final dish was OK, the texture was poor because of the small pasta used that lumped together.  In my opinion, my final dish's texture and the flavor were helped tremendously by the addition of the frozen broccoli.  Otherwise, I would not eat it.  As a side note, the dish did not reheat well in the microwave the next day.  It solidified in the fridge and reheating it in the microwave caused hot and cold spots and the cheese did not melt.<br /><br />Other than the seemingly low price, I am not sure what the appeal of this kit is.  You have to buy your own chicken, and, potentially, broccoli, so all you are getting as a "bundle" is pasta, seasoning, and cheese paste.  I think you can get the same quantities of these products for the same or lower price, plus you will be able to choose your own kind pasta, and will end up with a better tasting dish with a nicer texture.

review/summary: Bland taste, plain unappetizing.
review/text: Hmm Where to start? I usually mess with every meal I get that comes in a box and as my wife would say. I eat everything. I cooked this exactly as the directions suggested. As soon as I saw the broccoli powder junk I was like oh know but figured I would precede. I cooked the chicken in cubes and put salt and pepper and a lil cayenne to add a lil heat. When I was finished it was a yellow mess. I took about a bite out and brought it to my wife. She took a small bite and gave me the look as if she was gonna spit it out onto the plate. So I made her something else. I decided that I would just eat it because I dont like things going to waste. I added a lil milk because it was very dry and more salt and pepper because of it being very bland and flat tasting. I got about half way through what I put on my plate and could not do it. This just tasted horrible period. I would not recommend this to a dog let alone a human being unless they were starving and still I would feel bad for giving it to them. The idea itself sounds yummy but did not do it for us at all.

review/summary: The dogs loved it, me not so much
review/text: This dinner kit was not at all what I was expecting, was poor in quality, and overly complicated with four separate packages to mix together.  It does, however only take 20 minutes to make, but at the end of it, I found it inedible.  I had somewhat realistic expectations that you weren't going to get broccoli out of a box so had some fresh broccoli on hand.  I'm glad I did, because the separate broccoli packet that came with this dinner kit was essentially smashed broccoli dust.  There's a separate packet for seasoning and for pasta as well, but you add them at the same time.  I couldn't help but wonder why the pasta and seasoning wouldn't be in one packet, but I guess they felt it necessary and more costly.  The pasta was also not what I was expecting.  For some reason I was thinking it would be a substantial pasta, but it was actually orzo that ended up looking and tasting more like rice than pasta.  The last packet was the velveeta cheese packet which looked rich and creamy, but when combined with all the other ingredients, ended up resulting in a slightly sweet chemical taste.  I took a couple of bites and really didn't like it all.  My dogs were not so discerning, but for a family meal, it tastes overprocessed and isn't better than plain macaroni and cheese.<br /><br />If you're going to go through the trouble of making chicken and broccoli with cheese, you could probably add real chicken and broccoli to standard mac and cheese and do much better than this.

review/summary: Velveeta Broccoli & Cheese ...YUCK!!!
review/text: While its cooking I will admit that it smells fabulous... BUT THATS WHERE IS STOPS! When it comes time to eat, my husband, teenage son and I tried it & we all agreed that its nothing but PURE YUCK! This dish is bland as bland can be, it has absolutely no taste at all. No matter what you top it with to make it taste better it doesn't help it. We tried topping it with extra/extra shredded cheese, Parmesan cheese and even a 21 seasoning blend all of which only helped it slightly, if that.<br /><br />When it came to cooking it I should of new better, when I opened the packaging and saw its seasoning packet...my first thought was thats all the seasoning, hmm? It wasn't much. Then I saw the broccoli florets packet and had to laugh cause it was more like broccoli powdered seasonings. So I streamed fresh broccoli to add to it for more hearty substance with the chicken. However, sadly it was a huge waste of good money that I paid for the broccoli and the chicken in making this dish. NEVER, EVER AGAIN! Don't waist you money on this, its truly not worth it even if its free.

review/text: I really try to avoid processed foods, but if I'm going to splurge and eat something unhealthy one of my very favorite cheat foods is Velveeta shells and cheese.  When I saw this I instantly thought that it would be a great thing to keep in the house for a last minute guilty pleasure dinner.  However, when I made it I only had a few bites and threw the rest away.  It just didn't taste nearly good enought to rationalize all of the preservatives and empty calories.  Something is off about the sauce, it isn't the same as shells and cheese and the whole thing just had a really funny mouthfeel and flavor.  I would skip this and just stick with the original which is always a great indulgence!

review/summary: Disappointingly Bland
review/text: I was very disappointed with this offering from Kraft.  I cannot speak to the other flavors, but the Chicken and Broccoli dinner was very bland.  It's as if Kraft was trying not to offend anyone's taste buds by creating a dish that didn't have a distinctive taste.  It that was the case... they've succeeded.  The consistency was also a bit disappointing, a bit too creamy for my tastes and the broccoli was hard to find.  It's in there, but not in abundance.  Overall, I don't think I'll seek this out at the grocery store.

review/summary: Not all that convenient for experienced cooks
review/text: I'm a good cook with decades of experience.  I should have read the description better.  This doesn't include chicken, so it's not all that shelf-to-table ready.  I still have to buy, prepare, and cook chicken to add to this, and that's the part that is the most difficult to accomplish on a busy day!<br /><br />It's "okay."  Nothing spectacular.  It just doesn't save enough effort to warrant purchasing it, although it is less expensive than using frozen broccoli & real cheese.  I was really hoping it was one of those dinners that everything was included, and it was an easy breezy half hour from the pantry to serving--this isn't that kind of boxed dinner, but more like a "hamburger helper" for chicken breast.<br /><br />I might buy it again, but it's not something for my "emergency pantry" for when I need a complete meal fast.

Since I didn't have any chicken breast meat on hand I used some canned chicken, which took a little bit off the cooking time; after that, the rest of it was a breeze.<br /><br />My family and I were very pleased by not only the ease of cooking this product, but the wonderful taste.  The cheese sauce wasn't too heavy, and the broccoli blended in nicely with everything else.  All in all, a great product and a pleasure to eat.

review/summary: Easy and Tasty
review/text: I just got home from a long trip and was faced with making dinner.  Luckily, the Velveeta Cheesy Skillet dinner was sitting in my pantry.  I browned a pound of chicken breast strips and followed the directions.  It was a quick and easy dinner for the family and everyone enjoyed it.  The ingredients come in 4 different packets - the pasta (orzo I think), seasonings, dehyrated broccoli and Velveeta cheese sauce.  After browning the chicken, just add the seasoning and pasta along with about 2 1/2 cups of water and cover.  In about 7 or 8 minutes, add the dehydrated broccoli and cook another 2-3 minutes.  Then remove from heat and add the cheese sauce.  My kids loved it and there was plenty for everyone.  I found it to be better tasting than Chicken Helper and easier to prepare.  My only complaint was the miniscule amount of broccoli.  It was more like a sprinkling of dried parsley than broccoli florets.  Of course, you can always add your own fresh or frozen broccoli or other veggies to make it healthier and heartier.  Overall, a good choice for a hectic night when you don't have much time to cook and a lot of hungry little mouths to feed.

The "broccoli" was dried powder. The kids didn't like this meal nor did my husband and I.  I think Velveeta should just stick with their shells and cheese.

review/summary: Where's the broccoli?  Kids hated it.
review/text: I LOVE Velveta but stopped eating 9 years ago when we switched to a healthy diet.  My kids, especially one of them in particular, loves mac n cheese, and that same mac n cheese addict also loves broccoli, so I thought this was a no brainer.  My husband and I liked the flavor, but the kids hated it.  I was expecting basically Velveta shells and cheese with broccoli and chicken and instead was flavored with chicken broth and less a mac n cheese than something else I guess.  This is most likely why the kids did not like it.  The "pasta" was small little rice sized/shaped pasta, forget what it is called, but I prefer larger pasta than that.  The broccoli was non-existent, it was a tiny packet of freeze dried broccoli "florets" that only added little green flecks to the meal, poorly done Kraft.  This product is high in sodium and calories and has many ingredients with hidden MSG in them (anything hydrolyzed or autolyzed and anythign that says "protein extract" or yeast extract) and it does not give anyone any vegetables.  Honestly a person is better off cooking from chicken and broccoli and adding it to Velveta shells and cheese.

review/summary: as my daughter would say "meh"
review/text: I was pretty unimpressed by this product.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the "broccoli" is dehydrated beyond recognition and might as well have been parsley for all I could tell.  It is probably made from the stems and leaves that are a discarded by-product of broccoli florets.  I am a big fan of Velveeta but I don't think the cheese sauce on this product lived up to their name.  Furthermore if a box says "Chicken Dinner Kit" shouldn't the chicken be included???  They should call it Chicken Helper if you're going to have to add your own chicken.  There are other boxed pasta and chicken dinners that come with a can of chicken.  In my opinion, if you're going to have a convenience food, it ought to be all-inclusive.  I actually used some Costco canned chicken in mine and it was by far the best tasting thing on the plate.  Also the nutrition information is based on there being 5 servings per box.  Perhaps if you are a bird!  I'd say 2-3 is closer to the truth if this is being served as your entree.  So in reality, your portion might be as much as 975 calories with 250 of those being fat.  If you're going to eat something that unhealthy it ought to taste a lot better than this stuff.  I won't be buying it again.

review/text: Since I have been known to burn water, my spouse took the reigns on preparing this dinner for our family. She advised me this was very to make...It only took her 3 minutes to do the food preparation and 15 minutes for the actual cooking/seasoning/serving.<br /><br />I'm the family taster, so I got first dip - and this tasted very cheesy, very creamy...that was because of the Velveeta cheese packet and not the powdered stuff. I did enjoy the additional seasonings, and I was prepared for a hearty meal. However, once the dehydrated broccoli package was added to the mix, I could barely see any of the broccoli in the completed meal. I've uploaded a picture in "Customer Images" to illustrate this.<br /><br />The preparation was quick, it was delicious, and it was a very quick 1-skillet cleanup. Each family member enjoyed this meal (since we're partial to cheese), but I was expecting to see and taste a bit more broccoli.<br /><br />This piqued our interest and we will probably look for other flavors/variations of the Cheesy Skillet meals, but I'd suggest adding your own broccoli if that's what you crave.

I prefer whole grain fresh pasta to dried white pasta, real cheese to Velveeta, fresh broccoli to dried and rehydrated green stuff.  This is NOT gourmet food, folks.

review/summary: The boxed dinner that is quick, easy, yummy & cheesy
review/text: I have had a special place in my heart for these "meals in a box" or dinner kits.  Mainly because I can recall as a child my mother being able to really doctor these box dinners.  She would add cheese, veggies and various spices making it so much more that a "pre-packaged meal".  I have adopted many of her techniques in my cooking today.<br /><br />As for these dinner kits by Velveeta, it seems that the Cheese Masters are a little late to the party since Hamburger Helper and even Rice/Pasta Roni have had a corner on this market for years.  Nevertheless, this "dinner in a box" calls for chicken rather than beef. The promoted flavor is broccoli and cheese.<br /><br />Inside the box there is a bag of orzo (rice shaped pasta), a seasoning packet, and a packet of dried broccoli florets and a standard foil package of Velveeta.  The only thing missing is a pound of chicken.  The preparation is about 15 to 20 minutes and the result is pretty good.  I did however make two minor adjustments in my preparation of this meal. I lightly dusted my chicken with low sodium seasoning as I cooked it and added fresh broccoli to the completed dish.  I feel these additions really made the flavor pop (I am sure onions and peppers would be good too).<br /><br />Overall this is a pretty good meal and easy to make.  I was somewhat turned off by a boxed meal "starring" Velveeta. I like Velveeta but it is a very processed food and I find a little of it goes a long way.  In other words has a very strong flavor and I try to avoid too much sodium.  However this meal doesn't taste too salty and isn't too cheesy. I am eager to try one of the other box meals Velveeta has.  For the novice cook this is a good meal for the "seasoned chef" this could be a nice foundation for a more epic dining experience.

review/summary: Dinner Kit Plus Chicken Chunks Makes Tasty Family Casserole
review/text: When combined with cooked chicken chunks, this Kraft Cheesy Skillets Dinner Kit makes a great-tasting one-dish family dinner.  The box instructions call for one-inch pieces of boneless, skinless white meat chicken that you cook quickly in a large skillet on your stovetop.  However, because I've never quite mastered the art of cooking chicken in a skillet, I poached my chicken instead, using an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00019G8IS">Oster Electronic Food Steamer</a>.  This added about 20 minutes to my total preparation time.<br /><br />After the chicken was cooked, the rest of the preparation only took about 15 minutes!  First, you add 2.5 cups water, a seasonings packet, and a pasta packet to the skillet.  The pasta in this kit is orzo (pasta shaped like grains of rice).  After bringing the mixture to a boil, you reduce the heat, cover the pan, and simmer (stirring often) for about 7 minutes.  Then you add a packet of dehydrated broccoli flakes, and cook another 3-4 minutes until the water is mostly absorbed.  Finally, you take the skillet off the stove, and stir in the package of soft Velveeta cheese.<br /><br />My family liked this casserole, with its smooth cheese sauce, quite well.  Because it uses broccoli flakes, it doesn't taste strongly of broccoli, and broccoli-haters probably won't know that the broccoli is even there.  The flakes do produce very tiny, but visible, broccoli florets.  I supplemented the finished casserole with a side dish of another vegetable, because my household likes vegetables and eats a lot of them.  The casserole was filling, but I think that four servings, rather than five (as indicated on the package), is what you should expect from the kit, at least if you are serving hungry people.  This product gets good marks for not being overly salty.  Although there is 620mg of sodium in a single serving, it doesn't taste salty, and a person on a low-salt diet can have it from time to time.<br /><br />I rate this product at 4 stars ("I like it").  Although the key ingredient (boneless, skinless chicken) has to be purchased separately, the kit produces a tasty, interesting chicken casserole that is very fast and easy to prepare.

review/summary: Not a fan of Velveeta
review/text: In the time it took to make this product, I could have made a much healthier and better tasting dinner from scratch. I was never a big fan of Velveeta cheese, but decided to give this a try. I had to laugh when I read from another reviewer that this product contained broccoli dust, because that is honestly the best description I would be able to think of. The instructions are pretty lame, because it says to brown the chicken, but it doesn't say to add any fat so the chicken doesn't stick to the pan. I added a tiny bit of oil, so it wouldn't stick. The taste was nothing in comparison to a homemade meal. I think it had a kind of chemical taste to it, with a gross after taste. My 18 yr. old son wouldn't finish what I put on his plate, and that surprised me, because he eats just about anything, but he is also used to homemade food, and didn't expect to get served this kind of meal. Even if I browned some cut up chicken, and then added some water, real cheddar cheese, heavy cream, pasta and some frozen broccoli and let it cook for the same amount of time that this product calls for, it would have been better tasting and a lot healthier, so I would pass on this one... for sure.

review/summary: Pantry Food
review/text: This is the kind of food a person puts in their pantry and uses when they can't think of anything else, are out of everything else, and don't have time to fix a decent meal. It will do in a pinch, but don't expect it to supply you with a vegetable. I could almost count the broccoli flakes in the tiny package included inside.<br /> With all that being said, Cheesy Skillets is relatively easy to cook, alleviates the need to think of something to fix when you're in a hurry and don't know what to cook, and, with the right seasonings, tastes fine.<br />I cooked mine according to the package directions, crumbled crackers over it and popped it in the oven until all the moisture was absorbed. This also allowed the flavors to coalesce.<br />If I use this product again, I'll add some steamed broccoli just before I pop it in the oven to alleviate the guilt of not having a balanced meal.<br />Finally, this product is high in sodium. By the time my appetite was satisfied, I had  consumed twice the daily requirement of salt. Actually, since I have high blood pressure, three times, but who's counting?

review/summary: Target Audience: Velveeta Fanatics
review/text: First of all, to call this a "Chicken and Broccoli Skillet" is two-thirds wrong.  There is no chicken - you have to add it - and the broccoli is akin to fine print in a cell phone contract.  Maybe it should have been called "Chicken Tasting Skillet with Broccoli Coloring."<br /><br />Packaging, preparation, and cooking are all simple enough to satisfy the lazy parent, the overzealous latch-key kid, and the agoraphobic nerd on a 72-hour <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0HKIU">World of Warcraft</a> bender.  Those interested in nutrition, the love of cooking, or anything with a semblance of non-processed would be best to steer clear.  Lucky for me I steamed some broccoli and saut&eacute;ed some chicken to "complete" the meal.<br /><br />What the Velveeta skillet does have going for it is Velveeta and portion size.  There is no mistaking the quintessential Velveeta texture that could make billy-goat puke tolerable.  The supplementary benefit of this particular blend is that it can be used to spackle walls and caulk bathrooms...if you're into that neon-orange, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZSTGIC">Tennessee Volunteers</a>, garbage-man convention sort of color scheme.  Regarding portion size, I ate for three consecutive days, and was "blocked" for the day following.<br /><br />Overall, this is probably not a product I'd buy.  The taste wasn't appealing enough to overcome the shortfalls.  Big fans of Velveeta will probably love it, but I'd rather have Hamburger Helper mixed with Mac'n Cheese.

review/summary: Quick & easy meal that hides the broccoli!
review/text: You have to add your own chicken to this meal which is much like mac & cheese, although the macaroni is more like a large rice than macaroni. Good to keep around for a quick, easy meal (you can leave out the chicken out, or use canned or pouch chicken.)<br /><br />Something to keep in mind for those emergency kits & tastes FAR better than those emergency meals/rations!<br /><br />If you are expecting broccoli flowerettes, they aren't there, yet a great way to hide veggies from kids that don't want to eat them! That way they can eat their veggies without realizing it!<br /><br />The box says portions are 3 oz! Sodium level is high (650mg per very small serving!) If using as a main course, I'd say realistically there are about 2 servings per box, so if sodium sensitive, you may want to avoid.<br /><br />Taste pretty darn good for something that comes from a box!<br /><br />I'd LOVE to see a similar meal made from wild rice that is wheat/gluten-free!<br /><br />Nutritional info is as follows..<br />Calories 270Calories from Fat 72<br />% Daily Value*<br />Total Fat 8.0g12%<br />Saturated Fat 2.5g12%<br />Trans Fat 0.0g<br />Cholesterol 15mg5%<br />Sodium 620mg26%<br />Total Carbohydrates 39.0g13%<br />Dietary Fiber 2.0g8%<br />Sugars 5.0g<br />Protein 10.0g<br />Vitamin A 2% * Vitamin C 40%<br />Calcium 15% * Iron 10%<br /><br />*NOTE: I wish food & supplement companies would post their nutritional info on Amazon.com (w/ a note that it is subject to change IF it is!

review/summary: Picture on box misleading
review/text: When I looked at the box that's on Amazon I originally thought that it was pasta, to be honest I didn't bother reading the description. Upon receiving and actually opening the box we found out that it was actually a rice dinner with little pieces of broccoli that can barely been seen. After making our boneless chicken breast and putting everything together I must say that it did turn out pretty well and actually does taste good. I personally wouldn't spend the money getting this box since I'm quite capable of making my own rice and broccoli dinner from scratch but if you want something quick to do when you're running short on time then this would be a good way to prepare something simple for dinner.

review/summary: Okay, but a little more work than I like
review/text: I consider this in the category of what should be quick, easy, edible food. However, the instructions are a bit more complicated than I like for food in this category. If I open this box, it is because I am short on time and need something quick and easy. However, here are the instructions:<br />1. Brown 1 pound of chicken (cut into 1 inch pieces) in a large skillet<br />2. Add 2 1/2 cps of water, seasoning and pasta. Bring to a boil<br />3. Cover and stir often for 7 minutes. Add broccoli; cover and cook until most of the water is gone, about 2 - 4 minutes. Remove from heat.<br />4. Add cheese with Velveeta cheese sauce pouch. Stir in cheese sauce<br /><br />Since some of those steps actually have multiple steps embedded inside them, this goes from and easy dump and heat meal to a more complicated recipe. For the same amount of work I can this same meal - just with fresh broccoli and ingredients I can actually pronounce.<br /><br />Now, I am no food snob - I actually enjoy the microwave version of the Velveeta broccoli and cheese pasta. Its just that the instructions for that meal is simply open the cup, dump in the broccoli dust, fill to line with water, microwave and stir in cheese sauce. For this amount of effort, the pretty much a similar product - I will pass in the future.<br /><br />Now, if you just really like the taste of Velveeta over other brands of "cheese sauce" and want a meal where all you have to do is add chicken - this is for you. However, this doesn't fit the bill for "quick and easy" and the flavor doesn't compare to fixing the same meal, in the same amount of time - with fresh or frozen broccoli and your own spices. Don't get me wrong, it isn't terrible; just not the ease I would be looking for in a box.

review/summary: Velveeta Lovers Rejoyce!
review/text: How much you like this product is going to depend on how much you like Velveeta. Despite the fact that there are a variety of elements in the finished dish (chicken, broccoli, pasta), pretty much all you can taste is the Velveeta. Half of my family loved it and the other half (myself included) thought it was a just-okay bit of comfort food. For a skillet meal it was a bit more involved and time consuming to prepare than one of those frozen skillet meals. Personally I'd rate this three stars, but since my family was equally split I'll average it out to four stars.

review/summary: Decent enough spin on a mac n' cheese dish
review/text: "Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit, 14.64-Ounce (Pack of 6)" is decent for what it is, and I did like it a bit more than the other Kraft Velveeta cheese dinner kit that I tried (i.e. Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger). The dish is easy enough to prepare. The taste is less salty than the usual processed dinner kits that I've tried, and the orzo which is used in place of macaroni works well with the cheese and chicken combo. However, the dehydrated broccoli crumbs that comes with the package is rather sad, adding no texture and only a slight, vague flavor to the dish.<br /><br />In all, this dinner kit is just ok. In spite of the fact that I'm actually a big mac 'n cheese fan, I've tried enough Velveeta dinner kits to realize that they just aren't my cup of tea. However, for those in the market, I will give this a slight recommendation.

review/summary: Flavor, ease of preparation just okay
review/text: Usually, I find these boxed dinners a fair trade-off considering the time they save; however, this one doesn't save that much time over preparing a similar dish from scratch.  The cook needs to cut up the chicken and saute it until done, then add the orzo, "broccoli" (more on this later), and water, simmer until the orzo is cooked, and then finish with cheese.  The slight time savings comes mostly from not having to clean and cut up broccoli, but you might want to think twice about whether that 5 minutes or so is worth it.<br /><br />The chicken is, of course, whatever quality you choose to buy.  The orzo is typical plain white orzo, which was a nice change from the rice most of these products use (wouldn't it be nice if one of them would include a whole-grain option sometime, though?) The cheese, as you might suspect from the name, is Velveeta.  All fine, if you like them.<br /><br />The broccoli, though, is pretty odd.  It's minced (I use that term generously -- the pieces are really tiny) and apparently freeze-dried.  In the prepared dish, it looks more like a bit of parsley was added for color.  Surprisingly, it does add some broccoli flavor.<br /><br />The flavor, overall, wasn't bad, but this is the first one of these kinds of meals I've had that truly made me think the effort to make it from scratch would be very similar to the effort to make it from the box, and scratch would have been significantly better.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, it's about average for this type of meal: 5 servings, 390 calories per serving, 8 grams of fat, 620 mg of sodium, 39 grams of carbs with 2 grams of fiber, and 10 grams of protein.

review/summary: Very good, but make sure you follow the directions
review/text: Like the other Velveeta dinner kits, this one requires only the box and a pound of meat (in this case, chicken) to make an affordable and delicious meal.<br /><br />Do not make the mistake my girlfriend did the first time we made this. If you have to grease your skillet, use a Pam spray or something similar. Using oil really will mess you up later on, as it doesn't boil off, and ends up messing up the texture to the point where it's almost a mush. Follow the directions, and you are good to go.

review/summary: Where's The Broccoli?!?!
review/text: This product sounds so good, but I was very disappointed in the finished product.  It definitely has a fake cheese taste that I cannot stand.  The tiny little packet of dehydrated broccoli is a joke, even after it is cooked it looks more like seasoning than a vegetable. This dish would be so easy to make from scratch with frozen chicken, instant rice, frozen or fresh broccoli and the cheeses of your choice, I can't imagine why anyone would buy this.

As my husband put it, it is the equivalent of broccoli "dust" in the mix, but the taste of broccoli is still there.  I liked the consistency of the pasta, it was more akin to pilaf/rice than regular pasta, a nice change of pace.  I would definitely buy this again, my 10 year old loved it, too.

review/summary: Not something I'll try again
review/text: I found this particular Velveeta Cheesy Skillets to be ok - neither great or horrible, just ok.  By the time the pasta (it is pasta, even though it looks like rice) is fully cooked it becomes a little bit mushy.  And I didn't care for the seasoning packet they include with this - it's not extremely strong, I just didn't care for the taste.  If I were to ever make it again I would omit the seasoning, or use very little of it.  The 'broccoli' they include in the kit is a joke, it's like a tiny packet of dried herbs, you can hardly tell it's there and it doesn't contribute to the meal at all.  If you really want to improve the quality of the meal cook some fresh broccoli and stir it in just before you serve it.<br /><br />It was very easy to make, and it was nice to be able to cook it all in one pan, but aside from that this wasn't something I'd want to cook again when I have other choices.

review/text: We ate this for dinner tonight and it was delicious. On an evening when I was running (quite) behind schedule, this took me about 30 minutes from start to finish to make, and that included defrosting the chicken which I had forgotten to do earlier. I was a little worried that the velveeta sauce would be overpowering as I'm not usually a fan of too much cheese, but it was the perfect creamy texture. My only complaint, if it is one, is that the dehydrated broccoli is less than appetizing as it comes out of the box, and I truly think there could be more in the meal to give it a little added veggie punch ... or I'll try and remember to add my own next time. Overall, though, the flavoring was good and it rated thumbs up from my husband, myself, and our 4 and 5 year old daughters.

review/summary: Amazingly Good Dinner from a Box
review/text: What a pleasant surprise Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit provided! I was a little leery, having tried a number of boxed dinner kits that were bland and disappointing. I wondered if I should spice it up a little, but decided against it because I wanted to review the product without tinkering.<br /><br />Kraft supplies everything but the chicken, and there is a spice packet, but I still wasn't convinced this was going to be much more than mac & cheese with a few pieces of broccoli and chicken. WRONG!<br /><br />On a night when dinner was left to the last minute, I prepared the Chicken & Broccoli skillet and served it with fresh picked tomatoes and basil. Not expecting much, we were amazed how good it was, certainly as good (if not better) than a meal from a family restaurant. It is superior to the frozen skillet and microwave steamer dinners we've tried (and we've tried a wide variety). As for spicing it up--that's totally unnecessary. We both thought the meal was delicious. In fact, we couldn't wait to have the leftovers (which were still good).

I wasn't expecting gourmet from this, but it was fast and filling- good for a busy night.  The pasta is orzo-like, and the cheese sauce is the sort of fake stuff one expects from velveeta.  My main complaint was that there's hardly any broccoli in the broccoli pouch.  There's a few freeze-dried sprigs, and that's pretty much it.  If I buy this again I will definitely cook some fresh broccoli and add it to the pasta.

review/summary: Not bad for a one pan meal in a box.
review/text: For a meal in a box this one wasn't too bad. The only part that I wasn't very crazy about was the pasta. It was kinda hard to keep from thinking that it looked like a pan full of maggots in a cheese sauce. I didn't particularly like the flavor or the gooey texture of the pasta and what's with the dried Broccoli? There wasn't enough of it to even taste it and what came with this looked like it had been ground up into a powder and had some dried sticks in it that looked like dark green tooth picks that had been chewed on. Using the real cheese in the foil pouch instead of that powdered gunk they usually use in the box meals was the best part. Even though I probably won't be trying this one again I will be trying the other ones with the real cheese in it. And for me that's saying a lot since I haven't bought any of the box meals like HB Helper, Chicken Helper, Tuna Helper and other similar stuff in a very long time because of that awful powdered cheese stuff they use in them.

review/summary: Family gave it a thumbs up...
review/text: During the summer we do a lot of outdoor activities so this leaves little time for kitchen prep.  I cut chicken into chunks the night before we went to the zoo and upon returning home just threw them into the pan along with the included ingredients. My family felt that I had whipped up a tasty dish.  I gave it four stars keeping in mind what type of box dinner I had selected.  Yes, there are more healthy options for dinner out there but in this category Kraft has created one of the better chicken dinner kits.  I would also recommend throwing a box of frozen broccoli florets into your cart as the included broccoli is really just a tease.  This kit will feed your family with little prep so keeping a box on hand is not a bad idea for those extra busy days.

review/summary: Tasty - I'd keep this in the cupboard to have on hand
review/text: This Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli is one of those dinner kits that I like to have on hand "just in case". It's easy to make - the directions were clear and easy to understand and yes, it does only take 20 minutes. I love cheesy food (the more cheese the better) and found it to be very tasty. As others have mentioned, the broccoli included here is a joke - it looks pretty unappetizing when you open the packet and by the time you serve the dish, the broccoli looks like dark green dust in the meal. Adding your own broccoli florets would make this dish a real chicken "and broccoli" dish.<br /><br />The serving size is 3 ounces (approximately 1 cup) and there are approximately 5 servings in a box. I found that that was a fair approximation (unlike the serving sizes for some products which aren't even close to reality).<br /><br />Here is the nutritional Information - as prepared (percentages based on a 2000 calorie diet):<br /><br />Calories: 390<br />Calories from Fat: 100<br />Total Fat: 8g 17% (Saturated Fat: 2.5g 15%; Trans Fat: 0)<br />Cholesterol: 15mg 25%<br />Sodium 620mg 28%<br />Total Carbohydrates 39g 13% (Dietary Fiber 2g 8%; Sugars 5g)<br />Protein 10g<br /><br />Vitamin A: 2%<br />Vitamin C: 20%<br />Calcium: 15%<br />Iron: 15%<br /><br />There is a note (in very small print) which says that 1 cup prepared as directed with boneless, skinless chicken breast contains 11g total fat (3g saturated fat, 0g trans fat), 75g cholesterol, 670 mg sodium, 39g total carbohydrate (2g fiber, 5g sugars), 33g protein.<br /><br />If you like cheesy food (and aren't watching your sodium too closely), I think you'll like this meal.

review/summary: I did like it..but a couple of problems.
review/text: This box dinner was very easy to make and had a very good flavor. I had some leftover chicken which made it much easier and faster to prepare. The only problem I had with it was the broccoli. Tiny little pieces which I probably would not use the next time. I will use fresh or frozen broccoli.<br /><br />The cheese sauce was very good, but I am glad I didn't put all of it in the dish. I really liked the orzo pasta. It was very different than any of the other Kraft Velveeta products I have tried. I wish it didn't have so much sodium in it.<br /><br />I felt it deserved a 4 score because of the above problems. Will try some of the other Skillet Dinner Kits though.

review/summary: Yum Yum give me some!
review/text: Excuse the title quote from the SciFi series LEXX, but I thought it appropriate.  This stuff was very good, someone who helped sample it made a key statement, that the broccoli actually tasted fresh.  I guess in the little sealed packet it hydrates better than the completely dried out mix they have in some other packaged dinners.  I do recommend something for novice cooks that worked well here. Despite all the flavors here, the chicken should be the star of this dish.  I learned something many years ago in Vancouver about how chicken should be prepared, and it's true.  Now you can't do this too far in advance, but as your searing the chicken you should season it too, and make a nice brown grill when completed.  The seasoning is seared in, along with the moisture and the flavor.<br /><br />In Vancouver there was a restaurant, part of a chain also in the US called the Bombay Bicycle Club.  They actually had one in my home town of Fort Wayne many years before, but then I didn't even know it was a restaurant.  I found out this chicken secret eating at the one in Vancouver.  I ordered a salad topped with grilled chicken breast, and when I tasted it I was just blown away.  I'd had these type of salads many times elsewhere, and mostly the chicken was just another run of the mill taste in the salad.  I asked the chef what the secret was, and to my surprise he told me.  People don't season the chicken right before the sear, and once seared it has a difficult time accepting any flavor.  Now I've made Tarragon chicken before, and I know that picks up the flavor of the spice, but not before baking for a few hours.<br /><br />To make a long story short, I seared it just like that, blended the cheese, broccoli, pasta with the chicken, and cooked as ordered.  It was great.  A good meal with nice a flavor contrast, and the chicken stayed the star of the dish.  I'll have to see what they charge for these retail, but if reasonable, I can see myself getting some more real soon.

review/summary: Big Hit at Our House
review/text: I make a chicken/broccoli casserole on a regular basis, but it is a time-consuming recipe when you are trying to get dinner in a hurry after work. So I was looking forward to trying this one. It was very easy to make, one dish, simple instructions for even a beginner cook, and looked really appetizing. But the big test was my family. They immediately asked what I had done differently to my casserole. I said, "Just try it and see if you like it." They did, and they DID! My husband loves chicken anyway, and the cheese sauce in this was very creamy. But that's what you'd expect from Velvetta and they didn't disappoint. I'll still make my original from time to time, but in a time-pinch for dinner on the table (which is most nights) I will definitely make this one again, and look forward to trying the other varieties.

review/summary: too rich and a heavy processed taste
review/text: Generally, I like having a box dinner around for times when I don't want to cook much or run out of other foods.  And we have a homemade chicken broccoli and rice casserole we really like, so I thought we'd like this.  For the first few bites we did, but quickly the cheesy taste became extremely rich and unappetizing.<br /><br />The box contains an orzo pasta, a packet of dried seasonings, a packet of dried broccoli, and a large foil packet of Velveeta cheese. To make this, you brown up some chicken breast that has been cut into bite size pieces, then add the orzo and spices and water.  After it simmers a while, add the broccoli and simmer more, then add the cheese sauce.  It's pretty simple, much like any other box dinner on the market.<br /><br />The orzo pasta was very good, I liked it a lot.  The seasonings seemed kind of bland but were adequate.  The broccoli is nonexistent, really.  It's just about 2 tablespoons of dried flakes that don't rehydrate much when cooking.  You can see little tiny green dots throughout the finished dish, but there is no broccoli flavor to speak of.  Frankly, I thought there was too much cheese sauce as well.  About an ounce less of sauce would have been perfect.  It coated everything well and looked good, but the cheese sauce was the main culprit in making the entire dish overly rich in both taste and texture.  We paired this with fresh raw veggies for something to cut the cheesiness and it still was too much.<br /><br />I think this particular skillet would have been better without chicken in it, instead as a side dish with some chicken made separately.  If Velveeta made a boxed side dish that was just orzo, seasoning, and cheese in appropriate proportions, I would definitely buy it.

review/summary: Everyone in my house loves this kit!
review/text: Actually, in my house I am in the minority, I am the only one that doesn't absolutely love this kit! When you whip it up, you get orzo pasta, chicken and broccoli, all in the creamy Velveeta cheese sauce. As with all similar Kraft dishes you must be a big fan of that cheese, as it does tend to dominate the taste of the dish.<br /><br />My one complaint with this product is with the choice of the pasta. Instead of orzo, I think that shells would have gone better with the other ingredients, and would bunch less than the orzo. But, nonetheless, that's actually a small complaint. Like I said, everyone else in my house loves it, and that's good enough for me!<br /><br />(Review of Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit)

This kit has a packet of tasty Velveeta cheese sauce instead of the usual powdered cheese in most "helper" kits. The Seasoning and Broccoli Florets are in separate packets AND the pasta is in a cello bag rather than just being in the cardboard box.<br /><br />The suggested crumbled Ritz Cracker topping pumps up the "yum appeal" AND more salt! Adding a side dish of broccoli, a salad and a fruit dessert makes this a filling, healthy meal.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+Doesn't taste like it came from a box, SECONDS were requested!<br />+Easily modifiable - you can substitute a pound of leftover chicken, ground chicken or even fresh chicken thigh meat pieces<br />+At less than THREE bucks a box, it's worth having on hand to jazz up a quick meal.<br /><br />CONS:<br />I wish microwave instructions were available on the box or from Kraft Customer Service...It's nearly a month of 100 degree days. We're encouraged to use microwave ovens rather than regular stoves and ovens during 2-7 PM electricity usage peak to reduce usage and stress on the "electric grid".

review/summary: Quick and Easy Dinner!!
review/text: The Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillet Dinner is one of the most easiest yet filling meals that I've made in a while. The product uses a creamy cheese rather than the powdered cheese found in other products and this makes a big difference in the taste the seasoning was perfect and I only had to add a small amount of my own seasoning to help. I added some grilled chicken breast strips that I use for my salads and this made the preparation that much simpler to prepare.<br /><br />The finished product has a great taste and if you add some steamed broccoli as a side dish and pop some dinner rolls in the oven then you have a perfect meal that is sure to be a hit with the family because my family really enjoyed this. Great Job Kraft!

review/summary: Good in a pinch!
review/text: We normally don't eat this type of food, but it looked interesting. I always liked the Velveeta-style macaroni and cheese products over the powdered. This has an orzo pasta though, not noodles. It was more like a chicken/broccoli/rice casserole dish than an outright pasta dish.<br /><br />I had some already-cooked chicken thigh leftovers in the fridge, so the prep time was very short. The instructions were easy to understand and follow. The little bits of dried out broccoli though, they looked like old parsley. If I were to make this again I might add half a package of frozen chopped broccoli to get some real-veg flavor and texture into it.<br /><br />Overall the flavor was better than most Chicken Helper products, and I assume that's the market Velveeta is going after. The creamy cheesy sauce was a big plus over the straight-powder products offered by Hamburger Helper product.<br /><br />The suggested topping was to grind up Ritz crackers on top; that would have made a nice touch. It was a hit with teen son and husband, and even the teenager could make this for dinner if he had to.

review/text: I wouldn't recommend this as a serious side-dish for a nice dinner. It reminds me of the kind of things I used to eat in college, on a budget. Or late nights after returning from the bars.<br /><br />Anything that's called Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Dinner Kit should not, in theory, make you want to add chicken, real broccoli and real cheese to it to make it edible. It's processed food and it tastes like it.<br /><br />Also, if you do make it, eat it all in one sitting. It is even less appetizing when refrigerated overnight and re-heated the next day.

review/summary: Nutritionally Empty & Tastes Kinda Funky. Not a Total Wash, Though
review/text: Okay. It's a Velveeta skillet dinner; we're not talking about a four-star prix fixe experience in Paris. My expectations were fairly low: it only had to taste pretty good. The included, freeze-dried broccoli florets were dusty and powdery; they didn't add much to the dish's flavor or appearance. The included seasoning had a kind of unusually sweet flavor to it, which I found initially interesting but was ultimately displeasing. The pasta was more like orzo (large rice, basically).<br /><br />It's a hyper-tasty meal: it has plenty of fat and carbohydrates (and, if you elect to add chicken - protein) per serving. Each serving isn't particularly large, either; I could easily eat two, though at 390 calories, I don't think I'd want to. It's inexpensive - a bonus! - but isn't a good choice as a staple. For an occasional, easily-prepared indulgence, though, it's a good venture and can be a welcome change from spaghetti.

review/text: I'm not a broccoli fan, and yet I liked this-- which probably says something about the amount of broccoli in it! My daughter loves both broccoli and mac 'n' cheese, which is why I got this-- turned out she only kinda liked it, whereas I thought it was great.<br /><br />I added the suggested crumbled Ritz crackers to the top and followed the directions, and thought the meal was very tasty. It's really just a sprinkling of broccoli for a bit of flavor, definitely not a full serving. You'd still need to add a vegetable to this meal.

review/summary: not something i would buy myself
review/text: I got this for free from the Amazon Vine Program. Glad I did because I wouldn't spend my own money on the product after tasting it. It is not something I would be willing to buy myself if I was looking for prepackaged meals for my family.<br /><br />It is really easy to make and doesn't take a whole lot of time. You can do it in a skillet or pot. I didn't use chicken since I was in a hurry. I thought it would taste a bit like macaroni and cheese with broccoli but it tastes nothing like mac n cheese. The broccoli itself was dehydrated and olive green colored...was more like broccoli flakes. The pasta is really tiny and looks like rice at first. I barely taste the cheese sauce to be honest since the seasoning overpowers it.<br /><br />Overall, an okay product if you need a quick meal. However, I will not be buying it myself.

review/summary: Not Bad - Convenient - But, where's the broccoli?
review/text: This is a product similar to hamburger helper.  You just add chicken and have a quick and (somewhat) more exciting meal.  The cheese sauce was alright--about what you would expect from Velveeta.  It did not taste like true cheese but did have that Velveeta taste that many people--including me--enjoy.  My main issue with this is the lack of any real broccoli other than minuscule freeze-dried bits of what appears to be broccoli.  It was probably foolish of me given what this is but I was hoping for more.  Overall, if you are looking for a cheesy (or Velveeta-esque) sauce to compliment your chicken with, this is it.  If like me, you were hoping for something a bit more tasty with some broccoli in it, you may be disappointed unless you add the broccoli yourself.

review/summary: Competition for Hamburger Helper
review/text: Tried this and was happy with it. It is a product similar to Betty Crocker's Hamburger Helper and Tuna Helper. I am sure it is designed to give them some competition in the 'meal in a box' category. Similarly prepared, you add chicken to this particular one, a breast is great chopped into cubes. The Velveeta cheese sauce mix is excellent with great taste. The only reason I give this 4 stars is I think they could have done a little better on the broccoli. What is in the box, or at least mine, was more like flakes, than pieces. The flavor altogether is a little on the bland side. But may be able to experiment with some added seasoning. Overall, I like it!

review/summary: Chicken and "Broccoli" Dinner
review/text: First, I have to say that when I got this product, my kids were quite excited.  They love anything with cheese in it so that was a plus from the beginning.  The directions are easy and you can substitute different meats for the chicken breast, which--besides 2 1/2 cups of water--is the only thing not included in the box.  I used ground turkey since I didn't have any chicken breast on-hand.  I'm sure that ground beef, pork or cubed thigh meat would work just as well.  One recommendation:  Stick to the instructions to the tee.  When they say "simmer & stir often", they mean very often.  The pasta sticks to the pan if you do not stir it often enough.  I stirred about every 45 seconds to 1 minute during the first 7-minute cooking time and just barely caught the pasta from sticking too much to the pan.  The reason I placed broccoli in quotations in the title is that the teeny-tiny packet of freeze-dried broccoli once placed in the dish near the end of the cooking time becomes pretty much non-existent.  It is hard to see and it does not have that lovely green look like it does in the picture.  I'd really just call it the Cheesy Chicken Skillet dinner and not even include the broccoli.<br />Flavor was decent, although a little salty if you eat more than a servings-worth.  The kids loved it, of course...it's CHEESY!  It wasn't bad for my taste buds either.  I was thinking that if I make this again, I might just add my own fresh broccoli florets near the end instead of the freeze-dried packet.<br />The Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit was a hit with the kids...I'd just leave the word "broccoli" out of it.

review/summary: Excellent Camp/Emergency Food
review/text: I read a lot of the reviews before cooking this product, so I wasn't expecting much as the reviews seemed kind of negative.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I needed a main dish in a hurry because I was short on time.  I used a 13 oz. can of chicken instead of cooking up some and it worked out fine.<br /><br />I tossed everything except the cheese into a 2-quart size pot, stirred as directed, added the cheese as directed, stirred it again and served it.  Yes, the broccoli was scant, but since I had steamed fresh broccoli to go with the meal it didn't matter.  Everyone seemed to like it including me and I really thought it was going to be pretty awful because of some the reviews.  Even my kid who is real finicky about cheese in her food liked it and ate all that I put on her plate.  The other kid asked for 2nds of it.<br /><br />I know that it's not the healthiest, most nutritious or even anything really good for you about it, but I realized that this stuff would be a fantastic camp or emergency situation food, assuming you had a camp stove to heat up the water and boil the rice/pasta.  It's got a lot of calories which would be good for camping especially if you do some hiking, and if a winter storm blows through knocking the power off for a couple of days this would be great to cook up on the camp stove.  It would be especially good if you had some canned chicken to add, but even without it I think it would be eaten quite quickly.<br /><br />I'll most likely buy some of this just too store for times that it might be needed and to take it camping with us.  It would really make cooking a meal easier since everything goes into one pot.  And I think this stuff would probably store for several years and still be edible so hey, get a few boxes and save them for 2012 if you believe in that sort of stuff.

review/summary: GREAT Chicken Dinner -- Move Over, HH!!
review/text: I've reviewed other Velveeta Skillets before, and while I like the flavor fine, I stopped short of saying that they were better than Hamburger Helper.  The flavor was different, but not really better.  The preparation was easy, but not easier.  The price is higher, so not better.<br /><br />But I think this chicken and broccoli skillet just might be worth the extra money.  Preparation isn't any easier than HH (but really, how hard is it to fix something like this?!  If you've got a problem fixing it, you may just want to step away from the stove and go to a restaurant!).  The price still isn't really cheaper.  But it tastes MUCH better than any Chicken Helper that I've ever had before.<br /><br />The real strength of the Velveeta Skillet dishes is the cheese.  The Helper boxes use powdered cheese and a milk/water combo to make the cheese.  Velveeta takes advantage of their core product to offer a packet of real, honest to goodness Velveeta cheese.  the result is a much richer, cheesier meal that is really light-years ahead of powder.  Compare Velveeta shells and cheese to any powder-cheese and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Preparation is quick, which comes in handy when you're trying to fix something good and quick.  My picky eater didn't like it, though to be honest she barely tried it; in fact, she decided she didn't like it when I told her it was broccoli and cheese.  My son loves broccoli, though, and he cleaned his plate in no time.  Don't tell your kids it's got broccoli in it and they'll be fine -- the broccoli is VERY finely chopped (this is one place that I was disappointed with the Velveeta, to be honest).  You might even experiment with other vegetables, and it's simple to just leave the broccoli out if you don't want it.

review/summary: Convenient fix-up for your chicken.  Not bad!
review/text: Liked the pasta and the dish was quick and easy to prepare.  Pleased it wasn't salty tasting, oddly it was a little on the sweet side?  The purpose of this product for me is if I have chicken and I don't have the time, inspiration or other ingredients to make an actual supper.  My main expectation here is the convenience and this definately has that.  I prepared without using a lid on my skillet and just kept it on high with an eye on it.  It was done in minutes.  I think it's a good idea to add your own broccoli because the flakes that it comes with aren't anything too special (as about every person here will agree!  Would be nice with a salad or veggie side dish.  At $0.18/oz I feel your are getting what you pay for here.  My six year old however, said it was too cheesy.  I thought it was fine.  You could either hold back a little on the cheese pouch or feel confident there is enough cheese in there to cover adding your own broccoli or another veggie into the mix.

I did  not read that part of the label and assume that it is within the norm for products of this type. That being said, the entire family REALLY liked this.<br /><br />No one flavor was overpowering (something I feared as I have never been a fan of Velveeta cheese itself). You do have to add the chicken to it ... why I didn't think of that I do not know; it's kind of obvious ... but everything cooks up quickly, and as I said, everyone loves it. We will be buying more of this.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: I have a confession. I really like the ready-made meals like hamburger helper. They are comfort food and easy to make when you are too busy to cook something from scratch. Usually the meals from a box are good, but not excellent. This meal was different.  I thought this cheesy skillet with broccoli was so yummy, I went back for a second helping!<br /><br />It takes a few minutes to saut&eacute; the chicken bits to get them nice and brown, and we bought some extra broccoli to increase the veg content. And voila! A tasty meal that my entire family praised, including my finicky older father enjoyed. Even my health-conscious older sister commented the meal was very good, and she is usually a bit snobby about premade food.<br /><br />Cooking time can get a bit irksome if you are in a hurry. You do spend time browning chicken, stirring, and getting the meal ready. To cut back on that you could cut the chicken and bake it in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes, thus saving you the saut&eacute;ing which sometimes I do not like to do. I really liked it and recommend it.

review/text: "Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit"; Add chicken with a salad and ; is really good in flavor but you have to make sure to do not add salt. It has a lot of salt pre-added. It does feed three to four people if you add a salad or vegetable with it. It is easy and quick. I have bought another dinner from Kraft Velveet and it was good too. It beats eating a boxed macaroni and cheese. This is good, fast and tasty and I recommend it for any one who needs to eat on the run. Thanks to Kraft, again.

review/text: I really wanted to like Velvetta's Cheesy Skillets Chicken and Broccoli but I don't.<br />When the product arrived I looked at the box cover and it looked delicious.<br />I looked at the ingredient label and I began to worry. The ingredients list is<br />long. The product just seems so processed. I thought maybe I could save it by adding real ingredients like<br />fresh broccoli but decided this first round I had to try it just as directed.<br />I was disappointed in the quality of the dehydrated broccoli. I really felt like this was something you feed someone<br />that you aren't very fond of. I've never been to prison but I imagined that this might be the stuff they are given.<br />Perhaps death row inmates are served this for their last meal so they actually want to go willingly to the execution room so they don't have to eat any more.<br />After I cooked it, it just looked wrong. It smelled wrong. I know I could cook better. I don't think this saves that much time.<br />I'm trying to move away from processed foods. If you are also perhaps you want to avoid this.

review/text: I have to admit I was pretty excited to try this, I love Velveeta Shells and Cheese so I was hoping this was a bulked up version of that.  As the other reviews have pointed out, the broccoli leaves something to be desired.  After I opened the packed I thought about leaving it out all together.  The flavor is good overall but it doesn't WOW me and honestly not that much better than Hamburger/Chicken Helper.  I also tried the Cheeseburger Mac version and I liked it better than the Chicken and Broccoli but again, nothing to get excited about.  The flavor is on par with Hamburger/Chicken Helper and the preparation is very similar.  I would probably buy it again because it is a decent, quick meal but it isn't something that I would crave.

review/text: As pre-packaged dinners go this offering by Kraft is pretty darn good.  The pasta is rice sized (forgotten the name of such) and the sauce reflects Kraft's mastery of cheeses.  The broccoli is minute but adds a worthy flavor and makes a plain chicken dinner into a filling repast with a creamy cheesy sauce that you really can't turn your nose up at.  I think for working Mom's it's a boon, but use two if you're feeding more than 3.  I don't like Hamburger Helper and I certainly don't like their chicken helper at all, but Kraft has made it palatable with a little extra pizzazz so I may have to go back and try other offerings now that I've discovered that some aren't half bad.

review/summary: When you don't know what to cook or want something quick
review/text: I ordered Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit through Amazon's Vine Program as a sampler.  This is designed to be a quick and easy meal for a person to fix on those nights when things are a little to fast and you don't want to take time to fix a full meal.  The package comes with noddles, velveeta cheese and broccoli; all you have to do is add the chicken.  For preparation I grilled a sliced chicken breast to add to the ingrediants.  Preparation was easy and quick.  Something that left me underwhelmed was the broccoli.  Rather than being heads its only the flower part and a rather small amount; only enough to add color to the meal.  Flavor is a little on the velveeta cheese side of things; not strong but cheesey.  I'll call this one a 3.5 star item with 4 stars on the convience (it's quick but you still need to provide product) but 3 or fewer for flavor.  More broccoli  (heads would have been great) or a different cheese might have added to the meal, how you prepare the chicken could also add more to the flavor.  Call this one 3 stars.

review/text: Easy to prepare. Good cheesy flavor. Even I can do it.<br />I did realize after trying other Velveeta Cheesy Skillets, that there is plenty of cheese to enlarge upon what is in the skillet. My own adaptation included chicken first cooked on the grill; adding extra broccoli from the garden; some bell, banana, and jalapeno peppers; Roma tomatoes; and mushrooms (fresh or canned). More bulk, less calories per serving, except I could not stop eating with only one serving. I cooked that good. Amazing, these Cheesy Skillet boxes.<br /><br />Also I found that Doritos chips went great with this dish; rather than the customize suggestion of RITZ crackers. That may just be a man's choice. Bottom line...I'll do Velveeta Cheesy Skillets again.<br /><br />Box directions are Brown, Add, Cover, Add Cheese. It's that easy.<br /><br />Hey mom...when it's a no-school day, have the kids cook this up. I'm sure 3rd grader and over can do it. It's that easy. It is possible to leave the broccoli out, if kids complain. Just add their favorite veggie...corn, beans, peas, or carrots. Make lunch fun.

review/text: I cooked this for my wife this evening.  The preparation was easy.  The hardest part was chopping the chicken breast which wasn't any work at all.  The rest of the process was just time.  It took no effort and in the end it was a great tasting and filling meal.  I did add more frozen vegetables because the broccoli flakes that came in the package were not enough vegetables for us.  The cheese has a fantastic taste; better than I had anticipated.  I usually shy away from cheesy dinners and was skeptical when I saw the package of thick cheese to add at the end of cooking this.  I actually think it was the cheese flavor that gave it the flavor that I really enjoyed.  I also enjoyed the thickness of the rice.  It was not the small flimsy rice but a thicker more hearty rice.  This also thickened up really quickly and the meal was ready in about 20 minutes.  My wife and myself had leftovers so I would estimate that this box could feed a family of three.  Overall I enjoyed tonights dinner and will use the coupon that came in the box to buy some more.

review/text: Kraft Cheesy Skillets are definitely not one of my usual meal choices, but as a departure from the norm, the Chicken and Broccoli is satsifying and tasty. Although it may be a bit too cheesy, you can adjust that. Just don't squeeze the whole cheese pouch into the pan.<br /><br />The nutirition numbers are not great, but unless you're really conscious of that (like I am), they're not that bad either. The calories and fat are in the acceptable range, but keep in mind they change when you add your chicken.<br /><br />This is a good tasting, very quick and very easy dinner solution for busy famlilies. In summary, I'd buy the Broccoli and Chicken dinner for myself, but the other flavors are not nearly as good tasting as this one.

review/text: We just made this tonight for dinner.  It says five servings, but that would be as a side dish.  As a stand alone meal there's probably three good servings.  This is basically a cheese risotto in a quick and easy form.  It does lack a little bit of "punch" in flavor, so I'd probably use chicken broth instead of water next time.  The timing of 20 minutes is pretty much right on and it is not difficult to do.  I think if no one came in your kitchen before you served it, they'd be impressed at your good cooking.

review/text: This was really, really good. When I was making it, it did not look very appealing. I left the chicken out becasue it looked like it could be awful. I added the pasta (that looks more like dry rice) to the water & the seasoning. The seasoning had a bad smell to it. I cooked it the 7 minutes & then added the dried broccoli to it & simmered it for 3 more minutes. After that I added the cheese & mixed it well. It still looked awful but I dished it up & guess what, it was fantastic. I ate half of it at one time. I don't see where adding your own pound of chicken breasts to it would add any more flavor so I would serve this as a side dish or just eat it as meal. It had a nice flavor of broccoli to it with just the right amount of cheese sauce. GOOD JOB VELVEETA..... I'm sold on it.

review/summary: Comfort Food - Easily Made
review/text: Summary:  Preparation a snap, Tastes good, Filling.<br /><br />Kraft Chicken and Broccoli skillets are a box of home style comfort food.  Smooth taste, nice creamy texture.  The cheese sauce is the dominant taste which would be a problem if it wasn't such tasty cheese.<br /><br />It's easy to make but you do have to add your own chicken.  That isn't obvious from the Amazon description.  Kraft suggests a pound of boneless chicken breasts.  I used thighs - I imagine almost any meat would work.<br /><br />A funny thing about the cooking is the dish looks TERRIBLE up until the time you finish.  You might think something has gone wrong - nope.<br /><br />Nutrionally, I see no problems.  For medical reasons I have to stay on a low fat diet and this slips in under my limit.  8g fat, (2.5 saturated) is no biggee - especially for something this cheesy!  Sodium is 620mg - something you might need to watch out for depending on what your daily limit is.<br /><br />It would be easy enough to adjust the recipe so as to lower those numbers.  Add more macaroni, less meat, don't use all the cheese (ANYTHING but that!) and you can make do.<br /><br />Prep time was under half an hour.

review/summary: Good Stuff, Easy, but Even Better with Customization
review/text: We tried this package's brother first, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052F8JXI">Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac</a>.  This one was better; my wife and kids agree.  We will definitely look for this one again, but will pump it up to better suit our personal tastes.<br /><br />Although the instructions say one pound of chicken, I went for poultry broke and used a package of 2.47 pounds.  Yes, call me wild, reckless, impetuous, whatever.  Given the fact that the instructions for the amount of water are based on what the orzo and broccoli will soak up, the extra chicken didn't do anything to the recipe, and actually made the finished dish a lot better.  So, I advise that you use at least two pounds of chicken when you cook this kit.<br /><br />Also, the instructions advise to cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces.  I did that, and they came out pretty big, as in pretty big bite-size.  I advise to cut the chicken into �-inch pieces, and you'll get better distribution throughout the dish.  Smaller pieces also will cut the cooking time.<br /><br />It cooks up just fine, although my cooking time was quite a bit more than indicated on the box.  Total time for me, from the first of the chicken browning until serving was about an hour.  Consider, though, that I used more chicken than advised which likely affected the overall cooking time as indicated on the box's directions.  Yes, it was worth the prep time and wait.<br /><br />The seasoning ingredients are passable, smelling in the pouch an awful lot like canned parmesan cheese, with a hint of celery and parsley.  The orzo plumped up very nicely and filled out the dish well.  The broccoli florets were the only real surprise in the package, coming in a very small envelope and coming out a lot more like ground-up spice bits than the broccoli I thought I'd be getting.  Actually, the box's depiction is about right in terms of broccoli size and distribution.  This package's broccoli will not suffice for your USDA-recommended vegetable intake; it lends color and a small amount of texture to the dish, but to my experience offered no additional taste.  The product's title is "chicken and broccoli," but the ratio is far from equal.<br /><br />The Velveeta cheez pouch was squishy and cheezy and ample; I was surprised by the amount of cheez I was squeezing into the dish.  But hey, it melted down just fine and mixed in with the dish in no time, glomming it all together super-American-style.  As it did this, I was thinking that mixing it with some cream of mushroom soup, dropping the entire thing into a casserole dish, covering it with a top layer of cheez and some fried onions would really make this something cool; I'll have to try this.  Your results may vary.<br /><br />Taste: This stuff was just fine by itself, although my wife noticed immediately that it was pretty bland.  Like, really bland.  Given that I was cooking this for a review, I intentionally did not experiment with the kit (other than my highly irresponsible and psychotically dangerous use of twice the amount of recipe-specified chicken, and a good three tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil to cook the chicken, and I didn't drain it, leaving the juices and olive oil to join the dish, which  I recommend you do, too).  Yeah, it's pretty bland, but not bad at all, and it's got a lot of potential.  So, I recommend that you up-spice it to fit your own personal needs.  That might mean some salt and pepper.  If and when I make this again, I'll saut&eacute; some onions with the chicken, maybe add some fresh sliced mushrooms, and I'll definitely drop in some garlic, black pepper, caraway seeds, and maybe even a dash of powdered cayenne pepper to give this dish some action.<br /><br />Bottom line: in the dinner kit market, this one isn't really that remarkable.  Follow the simple instructions and you'll end up with a suitably tasty and largely unremarkable dinner for 3 or 4.  But, make a few tweaks for your personal tastes, and you'll end up with something much better.

review/text: Maybe I'm just easy pleasing, but I enjoyed my Velveeta Cheesy Skillet meal. It's cheesy, hearty, filling, and satisfying. Yes, you have to add your own chicken, but I wouldn't want it any other way. Neither chicken in a can nor dehydrated chicken hold much appeal for me. I do wish there were more of a broccoli presence in this cheese dominated dish, and for a future meal we may add some.<br /><br />For someone watching calories carefully this may not be a meal of choice. The prepared dinner has a stated five serving size, though Mrs. Spudman (she of the canary appetite) and I finished off about four servings together. According to the figures on the side panel, one serving delivers 390 calories (100 from fat) 620 mg of sodium, and 8g of fat.<br /><br />For me this is a good tasting, easily prepared meal that hits the spot. Those eating two servings at a meal don't need to save too much room for dessert.

review/text: I think this'll be the last time I try one of these things.  Even for cheap alternatives to help stretch a food budget, they're really just not very good.<br /><br />You already know what to do when you open the box- cook meat, heat water, add rice and flavoring... I mean, seasoning... then top it off with the supplied broccoli...  Wait- broccoli?  What broccoli?  The fact that the packet containing the veggies was no bigger than the one containing the seasoning was a big hint.  Someone else called it 'broccoli dust' and they're quite right!  It looked more like parsley flakes than anything and was hardly noticeable.<br /><br />It wasn't bad, I guess.  Tasted like chicken and cheese with the barest hint of... I dunno, vegetable flavor.  But I can at least say this one was better than the Cheese-n-Mac concoction I tried last time.

review/summary: Kraft Velvetta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit
review/text: This product is along the lines of Hamburger Helper, but I remember eating Velvetta when I was a kid and wanted to try this product of "liquid gold". The Orzo pasta was a nice treat but the broccoli florets were a joke.  Small little flecks of freeze dried broccoli (disappointing).  The cheese sauce had that strong smell of Velvetta, but once mixed with the rest of the ingredients, it lost the taste that I loved.  Overall, it was okay, nothing special, better off making from scratch.

review/summary: I liked it.
review/text: O.K. I got this for free from the Vine program.  As per the directions we cooked the chicken, added the "fixins", and we had a fair meal for five people.<br /><br />The kids ate it up.  They and my wife liked it.  I'm sure there was some broccoli in it but didn't see too much.  The little kid ate it and he usually turns his nose up at dishes that have too much broccoli; there was no chance of that here.  The sauce is actually more slightly broccoli cheese flavored sauce.  It's more a Velvetta & Chicken dinner with a "drive by" of Broccoli.<br /><br />I give it a C but would not buy it from the store.

review/summary: It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect: Velveeta!
review/text: So, this isn't amazing gourmet food, but you wouldn't be picking this up if you were looking for gourmet.  It's fast, it's easy, it's what you turn to when you're home from work late and you need to cook up something in a hurry without having to think creatively.<br /><br />I'm not going to lie, I love "cheese-product."  I'm a lover of real cheese too, but there's a special place in my heart for processed liquidy cheese-flavored food stuffs. They should really get a category of its own (powdered cheese product, nacho queso, and Velveeta all fall into this delightful category of cheese based non-cheeses.)  Anyway, I love Velveeta piping hot and poured over broccoli, but if you've ever eaten Velveeta and let it cool, you're familiar with the plastic-like texture the Velveta takes on.  It's the same here - you have to eat this meal while it's HOT.  Otherwise, don't bother.  Leftovers are good too - just be sure to nuke it to as hot as you can get it.<br /><br />The instructions call for one breast of chicken.  I feed hungry people, so I added two.  The dehydrated broccoli packet was disappointing, so I also added a fresh head of broccoli to the skillet a little earlier so it could steam in the water.  This was a great move - the fresh broccoli REALLY improves the dinner kit, but it's fine without it.  The pasta to chicken/broccoli ratio was a little low because of my additions, but the pasta is like an orzo anyway, so I didn't mind it.<br /><br />Would I eat this once a week?  Probably not.  Would I buy this again?  Probably - it's like keeping a can of pasta sauce in your pantry.  When you have time, it's the best to just make a simple pasta sauce from scratch, but there are days when there is JUST NO TIME... so... this is another pasta-sauce-from-a-jar-spaghetti-night alternative.

review/text: This was a really easy meal to make, but it really wasn't enough for our family of 4. The kids liked it because it was so cheesy. It was a little too cheesy for the adults, but it was good. These would be good to have on hand for nights when you don't have a lot of time to cook.

review/summary: it's ok but nothing great
review/text: We love boxed meals because they're so easy to make after a long day and better for you than fast food.  However, we do get tired of the same ole', same ole' meals so decided to give this one a try.<br /><br />First off, they recommend 1 inch pieces of chicken which really cutting them even smaller would have been much better.  Personally I didn't care for the flavor but I love velvetta cheese so I'm guessing that's due to the seperate spice packet that you have to add to the mixture.  What I do love is that there's a completely seperate package with the brocolli so you can add a little of it or a lot depending on your personal tastes.<br /><br />My husband said the dinner was actually very good though he agrees the flavor is a bit dull.

review/summary: A decent meal in a box
review/text: I found that I liked the Velveeta meal better than a complete meal kit. However, I did have to pre-cook the chicken which took away from the box use for me. It wasn't a whole lot less work than cooking a homemade chicken meal. It tasted pretty good and was very cheesy. I have a family of 3 and it fed us with some other sides. Overall it was a decent meal and a fairly quick fix. I would probably get it again in a pinch.

review/summary: Great quick meal for any occasion
review/text: I was truly impressed with Kraft Velveeta's latest creation. Not only was it absolutely easy to prepare, but it was great tasting as well! From prep to the table it took all of thirty minutes. The instructions were easy to follow and it definitely didn't taste like a meal that came out of a box. It was delicious the night of and was still enjoyable the day after which often is an issue with boxed meals. Highly suggested for quick meal ideas that will satisfy the entire family!

review/summary: VERY cheesy, not too salty
review/text: We don't typically do too many processed foods, but every now and then, it's nice to have something fairly "prepped and ready."  I was expecting this to be saltier than it was.  For that, the rating was dramatically improved.  I find most boxed dinners to be far too salty to eat without downing 2 glasses of water, but this didn't have that effect.  What keeps it from being a 5 star deal is that the cheese was a bit overwhelming.  As much as I love whole, fresh foods, I am still a sucker for Velveeta.  Even with my love of the V, I had a hard time tasting any brocolli.  We also added more chicken than it calls for because there are 5 of us and I saw no point in leaving a single chicken breast in the fridge / freezer, and even with the extra chicken, it seemed to be DROWNING in chese.  If you like that, this will definitely hit the spot for you.  Otherwise, stir the cheese mix in as you go, tasting a bit until it's right for you.  If we get this again, we will most definitely have cheese left over.  Next time we buy one or two "quick meals," it's very likely this will wind up in my shopping cart.

review/text: One of the things I have always done sith Mac n Cheese is add veggies to it. I love the flavor of the cheese with veggies. One of the biggest complaints I have always had with frozen or boxed foods is the one piece of veggie they will put in a container for 4 and call it a dinner. Buy your own veggies and add it yourself. You will then get a complete serving of veggie.<br />I don't even know what they put in this box. It sure did not look or taste like broccoli. How and why do these companies get away with this?

review/summary: A Cheesy Mess
review/text: I followed the instructions to a tee, but in the end I found this bland and kind of gross. Which is weird because from the box and description it seemed very similar to my favorite frozen dinners (Marie Callendar's Chessy Chicken with Rice). But I was sorely disappointed. Skip this, there are far better things to do with a pound of chicken.

review/summary: Broccoli in this?  Really?
review/text: Well, I have to admit to being very disappointed in this product.  I doubt that there is enough broccoli in it to constitute even one serving of vegetable in the total amount...  Actually, I am surprised that there is enough broccoli in there, to even allow it to be added to the description on the front of the package.  Yes, as one reviewer put it, there is a small packet of green dust.  sigh.  Bland unremarkable taste.  My skillet dinner looked nothing like the package front.  I will not bother trying any of the other Velveeta Cheesy Skillets, after trying this one!

review/summary: I couldn't taste anything but salt!
review/text: I understand it is a box meal so I really did not expect a great deal from it, but this was seriously one of the worst dishes I have ever had the shame of preparing myself.  Based on the box front, I thought that there would be a packet of dehydrated broccoli florets.  Wrong - no florets, just some sort of broccoli flakes.  So I prepare it according to the directions and sit down to eat.  From the first bite I can barely taste anything other than just salt.  I am not salt-adverse though I am not typically one to add a lot of extra salt to my meals, just enough to enhance flavor as needed.  This ended up being so salty I could not finish the dish.  I ate several bites hoping that it would get better, but no such luck.<br /><br />I really don't expect much from a boxed meal, but this kit even managed to disappoint those low expectations. There are much more tasty options out there for quick meals.
