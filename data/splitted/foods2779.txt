review/summary: Amazing Black Truffle Salt!
review/text: I've been using this black truffle salt for years and, when looking for more online, found it in this large container.  Now I can refill the smaller jar I have, send more to the kids, and share some with friends.  The large container is very cost effective vs. the smaller jars of the same item.  It adds the most amazing flavor to things I cook -- and it's one of my favorite "secret" ingredients.

review/summary: Quite frankly these mints taste nothing like lemon..
review/text: When you see something advertised as lemon mints, you expect it to taste like lemon, or at least has a scent of lemon. Well they may have tried to put lemon fragrance to it, but these neither taste nor smell close to lemon. These are just regular cooling mints in lemon tin. I give it two stars because it does function well as mints, but if you expect sour, lemon flavored kinda, you would be disappointed.

review/summary: Pretty nice
review/text: The product consists of an approximately 10 inch (25 cm) long piece of meat with 1 or 2 smaller (approx 1 1/2-2 inches, 3-5 cm) pieces thrown in.  The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package.  Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt).  It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather.  I appreciate the fact that the pepper bits are not "loose" like some other jerkies, so crumbs are not much of a concern.  Per the box, store in a cool, dry place.<br />Nutritional info:<br /><br />Servings per container: 1<br />Calories: 120<br />Total fat: 2g (3%)<br />Saturated fat: 1g (5%)<br />Trans fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 50 mg (17%)<br />Sodium: 1360 mg (57%)<br />Total carbohydrates: 4g (1%)<br />Dietary fiber: 0g<br />Sugars: 2g<br />Protein: 22g

review/text: ...in that it's chewy, beefy, and has a long shelf life. Jack Link's Peppered jerky is a tad too peppery for my liking, so I expected the teriyaki flavor to be just as robust. Instead, it is mild. Still really good, however! One word of caution, although it's addictive, eat in moderation, or your sodium levels will be off the chart.

"Subscribe and save" users should form a class action lawsuit like done against Netflix when they gave new subscribers the latest movies, leaving the old B movies to the long term customers.

review/text: After trying the teriyaki flavor of these beef steaks, I decided I would try another flavor so I ordered these peppered ones.  The flavor is really like throwing a salt and pepper shaker into your mouth.  You never really get a chance to taste the meat since your tongue is overwhelmed by this cloyingly salty, stale pepper flavor.  The worst part? There is 1470mg of Sodium in a single package, which is a whopping 61% of your daily value of sodium for the ENTIRE day.

review/summary: Good snack!
review/text: Have order three boxes in total now. I bring one as a snack to work almost everyday. Soooo much cheaper to order from Amazon than to buy at a gas station. Some reviews say they've had 'moldy' packages. So far I've only had one single package that tasted a little off. The rest of the box was fine. Some jerky strips will have a bit of congealed grease on them, I just wipe it off. Perhaps those folks with the 'moldy' packages were mistaking grease for mold? I will continue to buy this product from Amazon and will always have a box on hand in my pantry. (Oh, of note, these strips are made from WHOLE strips of beef, not the "chipped, chopped, pressed and pattied" variety, and it is very lean. Lots of protein and only 70 calories a package. 'Beats a package of potato chips any day! They are a tad salty, but so are potato chips - and I always have something to wash them down with too!)

review/summary: Best Jerky / Beef Steak! Best to buy it from Amazon!!
review/text: I have not yet purchased this product FROM amazon, BUT as soon as my box from the Jack Link's Site is gone I will forever buy it from Amazon alone! This (Jack Link's ORINGINAL Beef Steak) is my absolute FAVORITE jerky and has been for years! I've spent way to much time and gas looking for it at near-by stores only to be disapointed and settling for either Jack Link's other products or O'Boy Oberto which are both fine, but for me it does NOTHING for my beef jerky cravings! It is true it is quite salty but what good beef jerky isn't???? My husband a fitness/gym nut LOVES this jerky as well as the high protein content! I also LOVE the extremly low fat content as I cannot stand chewing on leather or fat that never chews away! This product is not only healthy (aside from salt), filling, great tasting, and a great snack thats easy to eat it is also CHEAP! At least in my perspective! On Amazon it is an amazing $10.00+ cheaper (when including shipping cost) than the same box from the Jack Link's website(kicking myself in the butt for that)! I will absolutely be setting up auto shipping for this product!

review/summary: Less Additives than other Packaged Jerky
review/text: It's tough to rate a food item as everyone has their own tastes. However, I think when it comes to store bought beef jerky, Jack Link's is about as good as they come. Most companies add a ton of extra garbage to their jerky, including sugar. You'll sometimes find 8-10 grams of sugar in some other brands. But with Jack Link's you are getting only 2 grams, and a taste that is comparable. And while all jerky is high in sodium, I realized these are a bit less than most competitors.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is just good beef jerky without all the hoopla. A perfect healthy snack for someone in need of a little extra protein during the day. It won't beat the stuff coming direct from a butcher, but it's better than most of the other one's you'll find at a convenient store.

review/text: It's a nice price for a good jerky.  I try to keep loaded up on protein, and these jerkys are easy to just have lying around in case I feel like having one.  They taste pretty good, they're very low in carbohydrates and fat...<br /><br />But they're too salty.  I don't mean in a "Gee that's more than the Surgeon General recommends" kind of way, but in a disgusting kind of way.  Maybe if you have a really high tolerance for salt it's no problem, but I think most people would agree...anyway I get the Teriyaki flavor, with 440 mg of salt per oz.  The Pepper and the original flavors, at 770 per oz, are just too salty for me to want to eat.<br /><br />Amazon also has like alligator and elk and duck jerkey for sale...think I might give those a try once I run through this box.

review/summary: Thick and chewy, not traditional jerky but delicious nonetheless
review/text: I am in search of a good jerky and just had to try these.  I guess I paid little attention to the label "Beef Steak" versus beef jerky.  These pieces are thick and chewy and very peppery (in the original flavor).  I [personally find that I have more of an affinity to the regular, thinner sliced jerky over these "beef steaks" ... but we bought two boxes and are certainly enjoying them.<br /><br />These 2-ounce packs are filling, packed with protein and provide a great mid-day energy boost.  They travel well and the Jack Links brand has not let us down.  With so many varieties, we will be trying more.  These were a pleasant surprise and were different.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is a thicker cut, 2 oz packs have 1280 mgs of sodium per serving.  Quite a lot!  Also, keep a toothpick or dental floss nearby, you'll need it!<br /><br />Very enjoyable nonetheless.

review/summary: Tasty but very salty!
review/text: I've picked up the smaller size at convenience stores and have always liked them.  I read some of the reviews and one person mentioned how very salty they were, but I bought this pack of 12 anyway.  I thought maybe he was just a little sensitive, but, wow, he was right!  I like the flavor, but cannot eat much of it at once. I eat only a small amount each time and close the package back up.  The small ones I get in the convenience stores don't seem this salty.

review/summary: That's what she said!
review/text: This is big!  It's about a foot long and they has a pretty good girth to it (that's what she said)!  It's not as soft as normal jerky you find in the bag - I think this stuff is made differently.  It's tough and salty (that's what she said).  It's not the best tasting Jerky I've ever had, but for the price it definitely exceeds my expectations.  I've tried the Oberto brand jerky sticks and they were not very good at all.  And with 23g of protein and only 2g of fat in each stick it's pretty good for you!  One stick is pretty much a meal, though.  I find myself working on it for about 30 minutes before I down it all (that's what she said).<br /><br />Goodnight everybody - i'll be in town all week!

review/text: I've tried the hickory and peppered so figured I'd try the cajun too since I like spicy food. It has a nice kick to it but it's not too hot, at least in my opinion. The spicy taste lingers in your mouth for a bit but it's not a hot burn. It's not as tasty as I'd like but overall it's good and I'll order it again. My favorite is the peppered though, great taste and just a little spice from the pepper.

I personally am a body builder and I'm looking to eat as much protien as possible everday. I definatly noticed an upgrade in performance in the gym and during the day when I take this. Although the cajun flavor is a tade too spicy for me at times. Like my eyes will get red and my nose will start to run. Other than that it is delicous. I will probably try the Teriyaki next.

review/text: Good brand.  They must pay their sales people a lot tho.  I saw these in stores for at least 50% more and convenience stores.... well, who has a wheelbarrow that big to haul around their change in?<br /><br />Send a lot of Jacks Link's steak strips and jerky to the American GIs in the Sand and found ordering it this way to be much more pliable and easier on your jaw than the same brand in Mart type or warehouse membership stores. If you send any to the heat like that, this is a much better product so there's a little time allowed to still have decent jerky arrive.  Steak strips and jerky are better liked than the nuggets tho..

review/summary: Try it in strip form and from somewhere else
review/text: I usually buy the Sweet&Hot jerky strips at Walmart and love the taste. I decided to try the 2oz stick from Amazon and was disappointed for 3 reasons:<br /><br />1. They came with expiration date only 48 days away. I've bought a couple of grocery items from amazon and this seems to be a common pattern. I've also read reviews complaining about the expiration issue on other Amazon grocery products. I love shopping from Amazon, but this reason alone may stop me from buying perishables from them again.<br /><br />2. These sticks are not nearly as soft in texture as the strips. Maybe it's because it's almost reached its expiration date?<br /><br />3. The flavor is not exactly the same as the strips. It tastes more or less the same as regular beef jerky. A bit of hot (as most jerkies are), but not much sweet. Again, is age a factor?<br /><br />I've tried many brands and flavors, and Jack Link's Sweet&Hot is by far my favorite. Get it in strips.. and get it from you local grocer.

review/summary: THIS + Flavacol + Butter = AWESOME
review/text: I have identified 3 critical parts to the movie theatre popcorn you love.  I will break it down for you:<br /><br />  1- Paragon Coconut Popping Oil = Provides the 'nutty/toasted' flavor, the odor that permeates the local cinema, and yellow hue to the popped corn<br />  2- Flavacol = The pseudo-buttery flavor and ultra-fine salt of good cinema popcorn.<br />  3- *Butter-flavored topping = that goo you get when you ask for "extra 'butter' " at the concessions counter.<br /><br />I hesitated buying this at first ... thinking "$15 ... is it really worth it?"  I procrastinated buying Flavacol because it seemed silly that shipping cost more than the product itself.  Well, now after 1.5 years I still haven't used up either product and spent less than $30 total for popcorn that is absolutely incredible.<br /><br />*IMPORTANT* - I read a review that stated the purchaser was dissatisfied because it wasn't 100% Coconut oil.  The label on the back says "76 (degree symbol)" coconut oil plus beta carotene NOT "76% Coconut oil" .  It's 100% Coconut Oil mixed with beta carotene (for yellow color).  The "76 (degree symbol)" refers to the melting temperature of the coconut oil.  [I had it sitting on the counter when it was 80 degrees indoors and it started to melt ... later that same evening when the A/C brought the house to 74 degrees for a couple of hours ... it began solidifying again.  Neat.]<br /><br />This popcorn oil is a solid at room temperature* (less than 76F) and provides NO butter flavor.  It does not require refrigeration once opened.  It DOES provide the 'missing ingredient' between cinema popcorn an your homemade popcorn.  Been using some form of vegetable-oil haven't you?  It JUST doesn't taste correct, right?  Add about a heaping spoonful of this 'popping oil' (solid, remember) to a batch of stove-top popcorn and you're done. (I have tried 'gourmet' popcorns, white popcorn, etc ... but have found that plane-jane barebones no-frills yellow popcorn from your local store actually tastes best.)<br /><br />If you want 100% theatre-like popcorn ... you'll have to substitute #3> above with the 'butter-flavored topping' of your choice.  But, to be honest, that goo kind of turns my stomach.  The butter does soften the popcorn slightly (there's a little water in the butter after all) but it's still awesome.<br /><br />I prepare my popcorn using a stovetop hand-crank popcorn popper, add a heaping spoonful of the 'oil' (remember, solid at room temperature) and 3/4 tsp of flavacol.  Top with 3 tbs of butter melted in the microwave and you're done.  Bliss.  Heaven.  It's soooooooo good.

review/summary: Another great Popcorn product for afficionados
review/text: I just found this huge gallon jug of red coconut oil.  I've been using it for weeks now and it tastes and handles just like the movie theater.  It is semi solid at room temperature.<br /><br />A friend I know has owned a movie theater for over 20 years.  He told me the industry secret.<br />You know that old popcorn smell at the movie theater?  That sweet smell that reassures you and lets you know you've arrived in the cool air conditioned retreat of your favorite movie house?  That smell is red coconut oil cooking over high heat.  Sadly the health conscious has abandoned this, but still today in most theater's red coconut oil is used.  I've found a couple products I really like but they come in tiny containers.  That's no good.  This is a gallon.  Bring on the popcorn!  This will be enough to serve an entire crowd at a high school football game.  You only need a tablespoon and a half for an 1/4 cup of uncooked popcorn.<br /><br />Next get Flavorcol.  This is the seasoned salt that is used.<br /><br />Don't use butter.  It won't turn out right.  Use butter flavored topping.<br />Good Luck!

review/summary: Makes great popcorn!
review/text: Coconut oil is what they use at the movie theaters.  Accounts for that sweet almost floral fragrance.  Makes great movie theater style popcorn.  Kinda scary seeing this giant tub of orange oil.  Even scarier seeing the level of it going down.  But does make crispy, fragrant popcorn.  it solidifies at room temperature, so you have to scoop it out into a bowl, microwave it at 30 seconds and then it goes into the kettle.

review/summary: Wow!  Just wow!
review/text: I've been studying up on how to make the perfect popcorn for quite some time now, and the very best advice I got was right here on Amazon!  Lots of "popcorn people" here, many of whom revealed their secrets.  I bought the threesome recommended by Amazon: Paragon Coconut Oil, Paragon Popcorn, and Flavacol.  With Super-Saver shipping, it's a deal that can't be beat.<br /><br />After reading the instructions on all 3 ingredients and the reviews published herein, I settled on the following recipe: 1/4 cup of coconut oil, 3/4 cup of popping corn, and 1 teaspoon of Flavacol.  I heated up the oil, added the popcorn, then added the Flavacol while the stirrer was churning.  I kept my fingers crossed and waited.  All of a sudden, all hell broke loose and the popcorn commenced to popping.  Much faster than that Orville Redenbacker crap---this was like a machine gun going off!  Very few unpopped kernels compared to brands I've purchased in the supermarket.  This is the real deal, folks.  My house smells like the lobby of a movie theatre!<br /><br />After a squirt of butter, I chowed down on the best popcorn I've ever eaten!  Seriously.  Buying the ingredients in these quantities saved a bunch of money compared to the supermarket, and I have enough to last for a very long time.<br /><br />I'd advice folks to buy a few Tupperware re-useable cereal containers to store the bulk popcorn, as the bag cannot be resealed; and I'm also looking into getting some smaller jars for more convenient storage and use of the coconut oil.<br /><br />Thanks to all who contributed their advice to this "forum" of sorts!

review/summary: Massive amount, but if you eat a lot of  popcorn...........
review/text: Ok.. the price keeps going up on this, but its ONE GALLON of popping oil.  Its semi-solid when it arrives in that massive container.<br />I managed to get one with free shipping so not a bad deal at all. The ratio they suggest is 3 parts corn to one part oil.  So.. 1/2 cup of kernals<br />and you need 1/6 cup oil.  Since most people don't have a 1/6 cup.  I'd use at least 2 TBS.. heck use 3.  It adds TASTE, and that's why<br />you buy this stuff!!  Its for heavy popcorn eaters...... but I've looked on the net, and the shelf life is around 5 YEARS if stored<br />in a cool dark place.  That should last everyone.<br /><br />Buy some...  lifes too short for crappy popcorn.

review/summary: I felt like I found the Holy Grail of popcorn
review/text: I've been searching for the perfect popcorn for 6 years trying to get it to taste like the movies.  After reading a couple reviews on Amazon a couple reviewers pointed out the key ingredients:  Coconut oil and Flavacol.  Follow the directions on the Flavacol, use coconut oil, and you're in business.<br /><br />The popcorn comes out crispy with that distinct movie theater taste.  I literally jumped for joy when I tasted it!  Just watch out because the coconut oil is LOADED with saturated fat and calories and the Flavacol is loaded with sodium.  That said there are just some things that are TOTALLY WORTH IT!<br /><br />If you're looking for movie theater popcorn do not hesitate, do not pass this up, just buy the coconut oil and Flavacol.  You will not look back.  Also you'll have enough ingredients to make popcorn for a year.

review/text: Well, some time ago, I decided to stop using my 30 year old air popper and retry oil popping. I am now on a quest to discover the popping oil with the best natural or synthetic butter flavor.<br /><br />This popcorn oil is evidently made from coconut oil and pops well. Enthusiasts will recognize that coconut oil produces a superior tasting popcorn. This product does most of that but seems to lack buttery flavor in the finished product. I would buy this again if I could not find something better, but there are likely some slightly better.

review/summary: Coconut Oil + Flavacol = GREAT POPCORN! One WARNING, and a few tips
review/text: Everything good you've read in other reviews is true.  You will get great popcorn using coconut oil!<br />*Coconut oil will produce the yellow movie theater look and taste.<br />*Use Flavacol as your salt, and it takes it to another level.<br />*I have not taken the 3rd piece of advice and bought a buttery topping.  Haven't used butter either. Just the coconut oil + Flavacol is a winning flavor.  (It's already popped in fat, so I've avoided pouring on additional fat and tell myself it's healthier this way.  Not permanent avoidance, though; just until I figure out which topping I want!)<br /><br />The warning?  Understand the composition.  Below 76 degrees, coconut oil is solid--think Crisco, but wetter--and is fairly easy to handle. Above 76 degrees, it's liquid.  And as a liquid, it is VERY difficult to deal with a gallon container of grease.  It's VERY messy. You will not get a clean pour. It will drip and spill down the sides.  Every time.  Even spooning some out can be messy. It clings to EVERYTHING--the lid, the mouth, the sides of the container, even the spoon.  Thus comes a tip:<br /><br />Tip 1: Avoid the mess by keeping some in a bottle as you would olive oil, and it dispenses easily. (I used a spoon and a funnel to minimize mess when transferring.) There is absolutely no mess or waste with the olive oil dispenser.  When it's cooler inside and it's solid, bypass the dispenser and scoop from the gallon container, which hopefully, is solid, too.<br /><br />(I suppose you could keep it in the refrigerator, where it'd always be solid and thus easy to use. I didn't do any research on whether refrigeration affects product, so if you're thinking that, pls research before you do.)<br /><br />Tip 2.  A gallon is a LOT of product.  Using 2-3 tablespoons at a time, you will have this around for a long time. A carton of Flavacol is also a LOT of product.  So if you're concerned about having it around for years, divvy it up among a few friends. Think a few olive oil containers, small jars (for when it's solid), and some dredges for the Flavacol.  Everyone can then make great popcorn.  (Great idea for homemade popcorn gift baskets, right?)<br /><br />Don't second guess yourself with this one.  Get a gallon of this and a carton of Flavacol.  You'll stop buying microwave popcorn.

review/summary: Good Product, Tough Extraction Towards the End
review/text: We use this oil in conjunction with a Whirly Pop and Flavacol.  Let me tell you that the results are amazing.  It's the closest to move theater popcorn I've ever had at home.  We will never go back to microwave.  Here's our ratios:<br /><br />1/3 cup popcorn<br />1 spoonful of oil (since this oil is a solid at room temperature we use a normal sized spoon and take one good scoop)<br />1/2 teaspoon of Flavacol<br /><br />My 4 year old daughter and I LOVE popcorn and this amount is perfect for her and I and my wife.<br /><br />The only issue I have, and it's a small one, is once you get about 1/3 of the way into the jar it gets a little harder to get the oil out.  Make sure you have a long sturdy spoon.

Only thing missing was movie theatre butter topping! I figured the formula (3 Tablespoon popcorn to 1 tablespoon oil). The oil in solid or liquid ( when it gets warmer this summer) will last years!

review/summary: That's a Lotta Oil!
review/text: OK, somehow I got the idea that Coconut oil was hard to find these days (due to political correctness/nanny state restirictions?), but wanted to try it for my hard-core popcorn habit.  ("I'll quit tomorrow!")<br /><br />Found this on Amazon via a web search, and cheapskate that I am I wanted free shipping (especially since most sources had postage as pricey as the product!).  I could have just added some cheap item to get total over $25, but NO!  I bought TWO GALLONS of this stuff for $42 delivered to my door.<br /><br />First thing I did was call the company to ask about shelf life.  Not sure the guy knew but supposedly asked and told me roughly two years.  Now that I'm using it, I should be able to finish the supply by then.  We'll see.  (Been on a movie kick -- free ones at Blockbuster thru July 4 -- so rate may decrease once that's over.)<br /><br />ANYWAY...  The oil is good but nothing super special.  Definitely gives the corn a yellow color once popped, and smells quite nice while popping.  Can't tell a huge taste difference, however.  I'd never used "solid" oil before, so getting the quantity correct took some trial and error.  Their "3 to 1" corn to oil ratio seems about right.  Slightly less better than too much I think.<br /><br />I'm sure it's not as healthy as some zero transfat ACLU-approved oil, but they can bite me.  I like buttery popcorn, OK?  If it was good enough for my beloved grandmother to make (in a frying pan fer Godsake!), then it's comfort food for me today.<br /><br />Sue me, DHS!<br /><br />Bill S., City and State undisclosed to keep the black helios off my back.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: I am extremely happy with this product, it gives popcorn exactly the right color, taste and texture as movie theater popcorn, right down to that little crispness around the edges.  The price is a little high, especially since you have to pay for shipping, but we have been using it regularly now for a few weeks and have barely made a dent in the gallon.  It should last forever, making the price not quite as daunting as it might originally seem.<br /><br />One note that I wish I had noticed in reviews so that it did not scare the heck out of me when it arrived, this product begins to solidify around 76 degrees.  So it arrived solid and will likely stay that way the entire time it is in storage.  It does, however, melt very quickly and cleanly when heated.  We use an electric popper with a heated base and a rotating bar to move the kernels around, which is probably not the optimal setup for this coconut oil, but it still works fine.  I scoop out the appropriate amount, drop it in, let the little bar rotate it around for about 30 seconds while it melts... then sprinkle some Flavacol into the liquid oil, pour in the popcorn, and put the lid on.  Since the oil has hated through by now, the popping starts very quickly.

review/text: This coconut oil is one of the secrets to great theater popcorn. When mine arrived by UPS it was liquid and quite warm. I knew already that it will turn solid at 76 degrees. I was just surprised that it took about 2 full days to drop down to 76 degrees and become solid even though it was inside in the air conditioning.<br /><br />I say this so other people don't panic when it isn't solid. Give it time. If it was liquid it takes some time to solidify. I was so worried I contacted the manufacturer just to ask. I was worried my oil was bad. But they assured me all is well and it will soon solidify and within a few more hours it did.<br /><br />Give this oil a shot. If you're a popcorn fanatic you need to use Paragon's coconut oil so you can enjoy theater taste right at home.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I bought a 4 oz popcorn machine. Love it and it has been great for parties, movie night and game nights. We eat lots of popcorn. Microwave popcorn doesn't do the trick it's not great. If I'm going to eat a snack it has to be great. Yellow coconut oil, yellow popcorn & yellow popcorn salt and you have an awesome snack. We have tried popcorn oil from the store, olive oil, corn oil, vegetable oil and clarified butter...yuck it was all awful. The true taste of the popcorn is unaltered with the coconut oil add a little popcorn salt and great happens!<br /><br />Just a little more to add...we have had 3 gallon jars now and we wont trade brands just because its a great product. Use flavorcol salt for the flavor and it is an awesome snack.  Friends and neighbors stop by everyday for a small snack great fun and awesome snack.

review/summary: stinky
review/text: I think we got an out-dated batch because it smells like stinky fried fish every time we make popcorn. I would never buy this brand again, or from this seller.

review/summary: Coconut Oil
review/text: Studied coconut oil for a while before deciding to purchase since we had heard all the negatives, being a saturated fat etc.  In my research, it turns out that it is one of those "good" fats and has 0 transfats. All I can say is WOW!  It pops corn excellently.  It leaves it crisp and flavorful, no different that what you get from the theater except you control how much you use and pay a fraction of the cost.  I especially like it, because I can seldom eat a large container in one sitting so when I go back hours later it is still crisp even with a topping, which sometimes I like even better than when it is still warm.  Besides, when handling it I usually get some on my hands which makes an excellent hand lotion (as it is also sold for that purpose).  I have also found I use less salt.  Before I added too much popcorn flavored salt to try to emulate theater popcorn.  Now, I am making the real deal and it is healthier than the microwave kind and tastes so much better.  Great Stuff!!
