review/summary: Gives Organic a Bad Name
review/text: The first sentence on the back of the box urges consumers to not "confuse vanilla with ordinary".  It seemed a strange emphasis for an organic cereal filled with all of the current "right stuff" and after tasting "Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise", I understood the need to convince people that what they were eating was something special.  The predominant initial flavor is faux vanilla, followed by a bitter, lingering aftertaste. Overly sweet and artificial, this cereal tries to be all things to all people, managing to satisfy few.  There are better alternatives on the shelf.

review/summary: Great organie and gluten free product
review/text: I am very glad to see more and more organic and gluten-free products coming on the market - finally! Nature's Path products are excellent, and this cereal is one of their best.<br /><br />Picture the less healthy but highly bought versions of Kix, Rice Crispies, and some kind of flakes all thrown together in one cereal - only much better - and you have Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise cereal.<br /><br />There are medium sized round balls, large flakes, and several different small puffed grains all combined into one wonderful crunchy treat. This cereal tastes great! It is very sweet tasting, but has only 7grams of sugar. A 2/3 cup serving is only 110 calories, so even if you bump it up to 1 full cup, it will still be just 155 calories, which is well under what most cereals are.<br /><br />This has only 1g of fat, 130 mg sodium, and also has 2g protein. This is a great cereal, but it is also wonderful on yogurt and as an ice cream topping.<br /><br />It is fully organic and gluten free: corn meal, brown rice, quinoa, flax, buckwheat. HOWEVER, it is made in a facility that uses peanuts, so that might be a problem for some people.

review/summary: Almost great but a little too sweet and a little too much vanilla
review/text: This cereal has a lot going for it: gluten-free, multigrain and a good crispy texture. I'm not gluten-intolerant myself but I do like to include grains other than wheat and corn in my diet, and this cereal certainly does that by combining corn, rice, flax, quinoa, buckwheat and amaranth.<br /><br />The reason I'm rating it 3 stars is for some nitpicky issues with the flavor. First, it's just a *pinch* too sweet. The nutritional sugars count is fairly low at 7g, but I feel like they could lower that 1-2g and that would be the perfect level of sweetness. The other issue I have is in regards to the vanilla flavor. The vanilla in this cereal is fairly strong, which at first bite is nice, but where it fails is that you get a little bit of a bitter aftertaste. If it wasn't for this bitterness and the slight oversweetness, the cereal would be just about perfect.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: I'm not a fan of any kind of dry cereal when it comes to a truly healthy diet.  Such are treats and I don't even pretend that they are healthy, even when they are organic or gluten-free.  This one is no exception.  I didn't get it because I wanted a healthy breakfast cereal, I wanted a cereal gluten-free snack option, which tend to be very limited.<br /><br />The taste is a light vanilla which is quickly lost to just an overall sweet flavor.  It stays crunchy for a bit in rice milk, though if it sits for a few minutes turns to mush.  The variation in the textures is nice, though I can see how it would be too much in one bowl for some.  It has virtually no native nutritional value, with most of its vitamins sprayed on.  In that light it doesn't fall any more short than any other cereal on the market, and is likely better than most.<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthy gluten-free cereal this isn't it, but it is very tasty and not at all reminiscent of the grit and twigs often found in most gluten-free cereals.  Take a bite or two and you won't know it's gluten-free, let alone "healthy."  As it's priced, it's no more expensive than most other cereals.  I'd buy it again.

review/text: This cereal was a hit at our house.  Kids and adults all loved it and the box was gone quickly.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />- Texture:  Stays crunchy.  Think Kix meets Rice Crispies meets wheaties with a mild vanilla sweetness.<br />- Sweetness:  Sweet enough to get the kids hooked but only 7 grams of sugar.  Our other favorite, Pops, has 10 g sugar.<br />- Nutrition:  Moderate sugar, very low fat, a little protein (2g) and a good amount of fiber (12g).<br />- Gluten Free:  Another tasty option for gluten sensitive folks.  We are not but would eat this anyway.<br />- Organic Ingredients:  the ingredients sound very natural and minimally processed.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />The box was empty this morning.  :-(<br /><br />Overall highly recommended.

review/summary: Natural, organic ingredients, but artificial-seeming result
review/text: The Nature's Path product, Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise, comes in a relatively plain package with the words nature, whole grain, and organic abundantly displayed on the package. To its credit, it contains two of my favorite grains: amaranth, and quinoa.  Quinoa was apparently a favorite for South American pre-Columbian civilizations.  The cereal's number one ingredient is corn meal.  This is ok.  I have consumed many boxes of Kellogg's Corn Flakes.<br /><br />The texture is indeed crunchy which is nice in a cereal. The taste is on the sweet side, if you are used to unsweetened cereals.  The cereal does live up to its middle name, vanilla.  The vanilla flavor is quite apparent.  This is to bring back memories of "cookies fresh from Grandma's oven."<br /><br />My big disappointment is that this cereal is almost one-quarter sugar, e.g., 10.5 grams of sugar of a total of 45 grams per cup. This is almost as much sugar as there is in a tablespoon of granulated sugar which comes in at 13 grams. By contrast, Kellogg's Corn Flakes has 3 grams of sugar per cup, Cheerios has 1 gram of sugar per cup, and Shredded Wheat has zero grams of sugar. The sugar comes from cane juice. It is real sugar, not the fake high-fructose stuff. It may not be corn syrup, but it certainly is not wholesome. Sugar has been associated with diabetes, obesity, hyperactivity in children, and may be addictive.<br /><br />It seems to me that Nature's Path has gone to a lot of effort to use organic, natural ingredients to create this new cereal.  Amazingly, the result is a product that appears to be totally artificial.  This may take a lot of skill, but the effort would have been better used to create a cereal that takes advantage of its natural grain ingredients rather submerging them in sugar and vanilla.<br /><br />The two stars are for the amaranth and quinoa.

review/summary: Better for a snack than for breakfast
review/text: First, I really like the taste and texture of this cereal.  While other reviewers did not care for the vanilla taste, I personally like it.  "Natural vanilla flavor" is 8th in a list of 14 ingredients.  For me, the flavor is just right.<br /><br />Second, I frequently choose Chex mix as my "snack of choice" while watching TV in the evening.  This cereal would be a much better choice for me.  Comparing the 1/2 cup serving of Sweet'n Salty Chex Mix to the 2/3 cup serving of Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise, I find that:<br />* Vanilla Sunrise is Gluten Free, Chex Mix isn't (or doesn't advertise that it is)<br />* Vanilla Sunrise has 1 g of fat (no trans fat, no saturated fat), Chex Mix has3.5g of fat (no trans fat, .5g saturated fat)<br />* Vanilla Sunrise has 3 g of fiber, Chex Mix has 1<br />* Vanilla Sunrise does have more sugars: 7g to Chex Mix's 4 g<br /><br />Finally, as a breakfast cereal, this fails when compared to most of the vitamin- and mineral-rich breakfast cereals that are out there.  Even the kid-friendly Cap'n Crunch has more to offer when it comes to vitamins, A, C, and iron:<br />* Vanilla Sunrise has 0%, 0%, and 4% of vitamins A, C, and iron, respectively, compared to 10%, 10%, and 25% in Kellogg's Frosted Flakes<br /><br />So, Vanilla Sunrise wins as a snack, but loses as a breakfast (depending on what you look for in a morning meal)

review/summary: No Sale...
review/text: I must confess upfront I am not a nutritional nut when it comes to cereal.  If I ate cereal every day I would be more selective I suppose.  But truthfully I only eat cereal on occasion when I get the hankerin' for it.  So I pretty much go with what tastes real good.  That being said I am not immune to the idea and benefits of a nutritional breakfast cereal, especially if its both good for you and full of flavor.  Unfortunately this Natures Path blend doesn't cut it for me in either respect.  There are not only cereals out there that are better for you, but I also have to agree with many of the other reviewers here that say that this cereal carries a sort of sour aftertaste.  In fact I will even go as far as to say it starts out with one.  The vanilla flavor is so abundant that it tends to create an artificial taste that is not at all pleasant in my opinion.  Also, this cereal seems to take an abnormally long time to soften as well.  It stays rather overly crunchy right up till your bowl is just about empty.  That doesn't help the cheap, overpowering flavor of the vanilla or whatever it is since it remains undiluted through most of your meal.  In conclusion, although the price of this stuff is not all that bad as good-for-you cereals go, I would opt for Honey Bunches of Oats or some other brand over this stuff if nutritional cereal is your favor.  This Natures Path stuff is unfortunately a no sale for me...

review/summary: ok, not as healthy as the box would have you believe
review/text: Nature's Path wants to lead you to a better breakfast, but better than what?  If you eat fruit loops, than this is probably healthier.  If you eat oatmeal in the morning, then this is not a better bowl.<br /><br />Let's start with VALUE:<br />This is a primarily a puffed cereal with some flakes.  The side of the box says a serving is 2/3 cup, but since it is mostly just puffs I think 1 cup is a better serving size to provide closer to what one needs to make it a couple of hours without your stomach growling.  Dense cereals like granola or Grape-nuts are an ample breakfast in a 2/3 cup serving but this is not.  So following that logic you don't get 10 servings in a box, you get about 6-7 -- so figure 1 box will last a week.  So about 55 cents a meal, not too bad.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />There are 7 grams of sugar in a 2/3 cup serving, so almost 10 grams for a cup of cereal.  I was shocked that this cereal didn't have more vitamins, the only thing it had was 4% iron.  It doesn't have gluten, but this is a moot point if you don't suffer from a legitimate allergy or condition were gluten makes you sick.  Gluten-free is so trendy right now I feel like this product is hitting a lot of buzz words but not hitting the mark on nutrition.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />The second ingredient is sweetener, and you can really tell.  I was shocked it tasted so sweet for being touted as a healthy cereal.  To me it tastes like a vanilla flavored  kid's cereal.  It is a mix of large corn puffs, seed-sized puffs that I assume are flax and flakes.  The texture is nice and crunchy but it doesn't hew up the roof of your mouth.  It is not good to eat dry because of the teeny-tiny sedd puffs, they get everywhere.  This might be good used to spruce up other cereals, like add 1/3 cup of it to half a bowl of bran flakes or something.  Or you can feed it to your kid as a breakfast treat.  My toddler LOVED a bowl of this cereal, but I wouldn't give it to her every morning.<br /><br />OTHER:<br />This stuff worked great in some homemade granola bars I made.  I cut out 2/3 of the sweetener and added this cereal in hopes of making them less dense and it worked great.  Gave them a bit of a "Rice Crispy Treat" texture.<br /><br />OVERALL: This cereal gets 3 stars because it does have decent fiber (4) and protein (almost 3) for a cup of cold cereal that doesn't taste like twigs.  I would want it again to add to my granola bars.  It would be good for kids who want a "sugar cereal" fix, but remember to give them some fruit with it since this isn't sprayed with vitamins.  Not great, but not horrible.  I guess if this was marketed as a kids cereal with a silly cartoon bear on the box we'd all be amazed at how good for you it is compared to Captain Crunch.

review/summary: Crunchy Vanilla
review/text: This Nature's Path cereal tastes a lot like vanilla Kashi cereals that I've eaten, but is lighter.  Still, it remains impressively crunchy in milk and the texture is an interesting mix of big shapes and tiny spheres.  Overall, a nice earthy blend with light sweetness and a good amount of vanilla.  It is very simple, but not bland.<br /><br />I am surprised to see some reviewers say it is cloyingly sweet.  To me, the sweetness was pretty subtle.  More akin to health brands than Lucky Charms.  For the record, I like both!  In terms of vitamin content, yes, it looks worse by the numbers, but that is the result of it being a simple mix of organic ingredients rather than a synthetic assembly with supplements added to make us feel better about eating it.<br /><br />Why not 5 stars?  While I like it, as a breakfast I do not think it would carry me far.  This could be helped by eating a large bowl, but these small boxes would not last long that way.  If you instead prefer a very light breakfast or want to eat this as a snack, I think it is a good option.

review/summary: Flavorful but Full of Sugar
review/text: Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise might be a "warm and delicious gluten free breakfast cereal" but the first ingredient is organic whole grain corn meal, in other words, sugar, the second ingredient is evaporated can juice (more sugar) the third ingredient, organic brown rice flour which is fine, and the fourth  ingredient, yellow corn flour (more sugar again). Ingredients after that get more healthy.<br /><br />So while the product may be "gluten free" it's loaded with sugar - you won't have side effects if your gluten intolerant, but you may end up on the ceiling if you don't handle sugar well.

review/summary: Great Texture and Taste
review/text: This is a really tasty cereal with a great blend of textures and flavors. It's a combination of flakes, and what look like rice and/or quinoa puffs and corn puffs. The flakes start to soften in milk while the corn puffs remain crunchy. It tastes sweet but not overly so, and there is a hint of vanilla flavoring.<br /><br />This product is gluten-free so it would be good for people with celiac disease, and it's got 3gm of fiber in every serving. It has grains like quinoa, amaranth, rice and corn, as well as flax seed in it, and everything is organic. The calories, sugars and sodium are relatively low, so I would consider this to be a fairly healthy food.<br /><br />My only quibble is that I wish it had a slightly more pronounced vanilla taste, but I can live with it as it is. I ate it plain, but this cereal would taste great with some raisins or chopped dates thrown in.<br /><br />Without even realizing it, I ate half the box! I would definitely buy this again. Recommended.

review/summary: Strong vanilla taste; first ingredient is corn; cereal very sweet
review/text: This cereal has a nice vanilla flavor but is very sweet to me.  It tastes more like a satisfactory dessert than cereal.<br /><br />The box claims this is gluten-free, a good source of fiber, omega-3 (0.15 gram which is 11% of daily value) and full of whole grains.  In particular corn (ingredient 1 & 4), rice (3), flax (7), quinoa (6 & 10), buckwheat (9) and amaranth (12) are highlighted as ingredients.  Most of these ingredients can be considered healthy if they were in its natural form, weren't so far down on the ingredients list and the cereal was not so sweet.<br /><br />The label claims you get 10 servings per box with a serving being 2/3rd cup at 110 calories plain (no skim milk).  Well 2/3 cup is not much at all since about half the cereal is puffed. For me, this box only contains 4 servings.<br /><br />There is no saturated fat which is a plus; in fact only 10 calories come from fat.  There are 2 grams of protein per serving as well as 25 grams of carbohydrate (sugars 7 grams).<br /><br />The ORGANIC ingredients in order are:<br />1. Whole grain corn meal<br />2. Evaporated cane juince<br />3. Brown rice flour<br />4. Yellow corn flour<br />5. Inulin<br />6. Quinoa puffs (the puffs take up a lot of space in the 1/3 cup serving)<br />7. Flax seeds<br />8. Natural vanilla flavor (one of the few ingredients not preceded by the word Organic)<br />9. Buckwheat flour<br />10.Quinoa<br />11.Sea salt (one of the ingredients not preceded by the word Organic)<br />12.Amaranth<br />13.Molasses<br />14.Tocopherols (natural vitamin E) (another one of the ingredients not preceded by the word Organic)<br /><br />This cereal is produced in a facility that uses peanuts, tree nuts and soy.<br /><br />In summary, "Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise" tasts pretty good to me and has a strong vanilla flavor I like but should be considered as a low-fat dessert instead of a healthy breakfast cerael.

review/summary: Great idea, not so great execution
review/text: I try to avoid gluten, so cereals have pretty much become a thing of the past for me.  I was very excited to try a gluten free cereal.  If you only care about the taste, then this cereal is fairly enjoyable.  However, it is advertised as a health food and this is where I run into issues.  The first ingredients are whole grain corn meal, evaporated cane juice, brown rice flour and inulin.  They are all organic, but corn is one of the worst things that you can put into your body and it appears to be the bulk of this cereal...well, except for the evaporated cane juice! (aka sugar).  The package advertises is as a good source of fiber and omega-3.  There are only 3 grams of fiber (not bad, but not great) and only 1 gram of fat.  How can this be high in omega-3 fatty acids when there is only 1 gram (or possibly less) per serving?  Then you look at the nutrient profile: Vitamin A- 0; Vitamin C- 0, Calcium - 0.<br /><br />I guess this is a step up from normal junk food cereal, but I think it falls short of what it advertises.  I do not think I will purchase any more.

review/summary: Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise Cereal
review/text: I was looking forward to trying this cereal, because not too long ago I was able to try a wonderful granola cereal by Nature's Path, which I liked very much.<br /><br />So, I expected to like this cereal too.  Unfortunately I don't!  I poured alittle bit of the cereal into a bowl.  On my first bite what I tasted seemed salty to me.  I also do not really taste a vanilla flavor, or much of a vanilla flavor.<br /><br />I love the flavor vanilla, especially if it's real vanilla flavoring, but there is also another mainstream brand of cereal that also came in a vanilla flavor that so many people also seemed to love, and I didn't really care for that cereal either.<br /><br />It does look interesting when you pour the cereal into your bowl, different shapes, which consist of corn, rice,flax, quinoa, buckwheat and amaranth.<br /><br />When I read the nutrition facts, except for the fact that this cereal is organic, which to me is major, the health benefits really are no better than even alot of mainstream cereals, this cereal is no higher in important nutrients.<br /><br />The total carbohydrates per 2/3 Cup serving is 25 grams, which is 8%,dietary fiber is 3 grams, which is 12%, and sugars is 7 grams.  The sodium level is only 130 mg, which is only 5%.  There is only 1 gram of total fat, and 4% iron.  I would call this a reasonably healthy cereal, and it is gluten free.<br /><br />Iam not impressed.  I wish I were.  It does not keep me from wanting to try other Nature's Path products, but Iam disappointed to find that I did not like this cereal after reading such wonderful feedback about it.<br /><br />Maybe I just don't like vanilla flavored cereals?

I only added milk to the contents of the box and enjoyed the vanilla flavor and did not notice an aftertaste. I liked that it stays crunchy while in milk.

review/text: This cereal has good texture, with decent crunch. Most gluten free products tend to be very crunchy which I like. The puffs remain crunchy after a few minutes in milk, but the flakes do not. I tried the cereal without milk first and found it to be lightly sweetened. I think kids would eat it, but it's not the candy in the box they'd normally like. I ate the cereal with sweetened vanilla almond milk and overall, the cereal is very good. If you have been recently directed to eat gluten free products, no need to fear. This cereal is quite comparable to any of the healthy cereals on the market, despite the lack of gluten. Recommended.

review/summary: Tout Sweet - Trop Sucre
review/text: First, the box did not come 1/3 filled -- it's filled by weight but there is a difference between a full-to-the-top cornflake box, where the shape of the flakes enable them to stack themselves with lot of airspace in between, so they look like the box is way full--- and these various "Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise" shapes that do a great job of nestling themselves into one another and within all the other shapes -- so although there is a fully-filled box here, it just doesn't look like it.<br /><br />But the cereal is way too sweet -- I wanted to be able to taste the various flavors of the corn, quinoa, buckwheat and other grains in the ingredients, but instead my tastebuds were assailed by a cloying sweetness that was way too powerful. I added hot coffee to the cereal and that helped take some of the sweet edge off. I also tried mixing in my protein drink -- and that helped take some of the edge off the sweetness, but even so I did not get to taste the various flavors of all the healthy grains.<br /><br />The Gluten Free factor was favorably noticed -- amazaing how heavy wheat can be on the stomach and senses -- the (wheat and soy-free) ingredients this cereal brought lightness, even with the over-much sweetness.<br /><br />My final take on this is: reduce the amount of sugar (and perhaps even vanilla) in the formulation -- and I think you will then have a nice enjoyable, hearty-tasting cereal that will wake up the tastebuds.

review/summary: Better as a snack than as a breakfast cereal
review/text: Nice vanilla flavor, lots of crunch, but the smaller bits get soggy quickly in milk.  The taste and texture remind me of Team flakes, which I don't think is made anymore.<br /><br />This is nice as a sweet snack, and would make excellent marshmallow Krispie treats.  It'd also be good crushed as a topping for ice cream or in a pie crust in lieu of graham crackers.  It's good when a food can do double-triple duty.

review/summary: A Tad Sweet
review/text: As Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise is a "health cereal," gluten-free and organic to boot, I'm guessing most prospective customers would be "health-conscious" and thus interested in the label's nitty (and, as required by law, its gritty). Do you care about sugar? The latest research says it is a bigger villain than previously thought, worse even than cholesterol and fat (well, "good" fat, anyway). This cereal provides 7 grams of sugar for each 2/3rds cup of serving meaning, for most people, a bowl of 1 1/2 cups (not much, mind you) would bring in 14 grams of organic evaporated cane juice (number two on the list of ingredients, which are listed in order of amount in the cereal).<br /><br />Of course, if you like a sweeter cereal, you might count this a strength and not a weakness. It's not like this is Trix or Cocoa Puffs or anything, where sugar gram totals are higher than Cheech and Chong on a Saturday night. To its credit, CVS provides 3 grams of dietary fiber and only 1 gram of fat (zero saturated or trans fats). And hey, it's gluten-free and offers a motley mix of corn, rice, flax, quinoa, buckwheat, and molasses. In fact, it looks like that hodgepodge my father used to create when he combined three or four cereals that were all nearing empty. (We cured him of the habit by refusing to eat the result.)<br /><br />Bottom line? If you like "healthy" with quotation marks (or an asterisk for the sugar), this might be your cereal. If, on the other hand, you're watching your pennies (economical this product is not) or carbs and sugar in an attempt to lose weight, consider the humble egg. Or old-fashioned oatmeal like Grandma ate. Flavor it not with sugar, maple syrup, or molasses, but with cinnamon, allspice, and cloves. Serve with morning paper.

review/summary: A new favorite
review/text: I can't believe I'm writing a review for cereal of all things, but this stuff is THAT delicious.  I'm picky when it comes to cereal usually sticking to old traditional brands, afraid to try new ones because they are typically a disappointment.  I had the chance to sample this (dry) in a small cup at Costco, I was hungry and just saw it as a quick snack expecting it to taste like a mouthful of hay like most organic cereals.  Wow.... very surprised!  It seriously tastes like Rice Krispie candy, only a ton healthier.<br /><br />I immediately bought a box, it's just as delicious as a dry snack as it is with milk in a bowl.  It leaves a pleasant sweet vanilla type of taste in your mouth after each bite, and the various textures makes it more interesting.  The smallest pieces are the size of rice, and the ball things are the size of Kix cereal.  It's a nice light crunchy cereal that doesn't get soggy too fast.  Going to get a bowl now... :)

review/summary: For the healthy breakfast eater..... not my choice
review/text: I'm not one for special cereals, and this one is considered organic and also gluten-free, while the flavor speaks of vanilla and it contains a certain amount of crunchiness.  The products are mostly organic, and there is quite a mixture.... Quinoa, rice, flaxseed, bran, cornmeal, etc., etc.<br /><br />When I look at the package of the product, it looks like someone mixed a whole bunch of different cereals into the box.  I never did approve of mixing cereals, and that is what this resembles.<br /><br />You have to acquire a taste for this.  There is more of a sweeter taste that I would not have selected.  It is acceptable, but nothing great.  For the more healthy conscious breakfast eaters, this would serve them well, but for me, it is not something I would purchase.  Rizzo

review/summary: Good Option For Gluten Free Cereal
review/text: I really enjoy this cereal.  There are a variety of grains in it, like quinoa, buckwheat and amaranth.  The texture of the cereal is also varied, there are puffs and flakes.  I think it is the amaranth that gives this cereal a nutty taste.  It's not overly sweetened and has just a hint of vanilla, which I like.  I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking for a gluten free cereal.

review/summary: Could be worse, should be better
review/text: I must start by stipulating that my body is gluten-tolerant and sugar-intolerant (adult-onset diabetes). 7 Grams of sugar in a 30-gram (2/3rds cup) serving size is IMO too much for a healthy cereal. And unless one is gluten-intolerant, gluten (a protein that is what makes grains nutritious) is a good thing. Sticking to objective matters, the vitamin content listed is 0%, 0%, and 0% of the official minimum daily requirement, and I presume if more were listed there would be more 0%. The exception is iron, with 4% (contrast the 45% from Special-K),<br /><br />Also leaving aside the rather loose legal requirements for labeling something "organic," the list of ingredients does not strike me as particularly healthy, beginning with cornmeal and sugarcane juice (called "cane juice"). I wonder what "organic molasses" is, while doubting it is a health(y) food and wonder what "natural vanilla flavor" is. I'd bet that there is little real/organic vanilla in the mix! I'm not sure what the protein source is, probably some quinoa, but the 2 grams (/30) is respectable.<br /><br />Turning to the highly subjective matter of taste, the vanilla flavor comes through, particularly in the variant on Sugar Pops, one of the three disparate textures included, along with flakes (texturally like Corn Flakes, and small textureless bits. This is the order, from top to bottom, that the textures separated out on the way to me.<br /><br />I liked Sugar Pops when I was a child (but put away childish things when I ceased being a child). The Nature Fresh pops taste sweet, though less sweet than I remember Sugar Pops tasting. I already said that the vanilla "flavoring" comes through. Some complain of an unpleasant vanilla aftertaste but I did not experience that. To me the taste was OK with no aftertaste.<br /><br />I don't see any reason for anyone who is gluten-tolerant to buy the expensive (and to me pretentious) sugarcane and cornmeal (these are the the main ingredients, though the list of ingredients also includes currently fashionable quinoa and flax seeds) mix of textures. There are breakfast "cereals" with organically raised components that are more nutritious and no more expensive.<br /><br />(I severely doubt that a box of Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise with provide any real persons 10 servings. "Serving sizes" are generally suspect, but for breakfast foods the usual one is a cup. Given that the pops that are tops or at least rise to the top have a lot of air in them, claiming the serving size is 2/3rds of a cup is particularly disingenuous.)

review/summary: I hated it, but Mom loved it.
review/text: I thought this cereal was terrible. It has a very odd aftertaste, and to be honest, this is what I would imagine balled up pieces of paper soaked in milk would taste like. Very "cardboard-like." It also has that really strange, fake vanilla-like taste that a lot of the ultra-healthy and "organic" cereals have. For me, this is just further proof that these "healthy" cereals taste awful. I'll stick to the Cheerios and Special K, thanks!<br /><br />That being said, I'm still giving this two stars because my Mom LOVED it. Don't ask me why, because Lord knows I have no idea, but she thought it was great. When I asked her what exactly she liked about it, she state that she enjoyed the taste and the crunchiness. She thought the vanilla flavoring was good, and was surprised that I didn't like it as she felt it was very "true to taste." She also liked that it had so many healthy things in it, i.e. flax. She thought that for a "healthy" cereal, it was very tasty.<br /><br />I guess all things considered it just depends on your personal taste. I mean, it's food. What one person loves another person dislikes. Like I said, I thought it tasted like rolled up pieces of paper soaked in milk into which someone poured an artificial vanilla flavoring. She, on the other hand, found it tasty, crunchy, satisfying, and overall delicious. To each his own, I suppose. I personally won't be rebuying this one.

review/summary: Crunchy and Vanilla-y
review/text: The name: "Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise" evokes a lot.  The first word sets the tone, and unfortunately I tend to relate "crunchy" first with hippies, Earth shoes, organic detergent, underground homes, crystal-based religions, and a general flakiness.  Now one could argue that "flaky" and "cereal" is a good mental association, but I doubt the copywriters and marketers were thinking in this vein.  I think they were after the more visceral, literal, "Hey, Velma, by the great white beard of Odin, this here cereal is mighty crunchy!  I can hardly hear myself think!" outcome.  "Vanilla," on the other hand, is what got me to order this product.  I love vanilla, and had to try this out.  "Vanilla" had me thinking "deep, dusky flavor," as opposed to "dull," which the box's back panel tackles unflinchingly.  And then you get "sunrise."  Well, the mental association intent is evident here; it's all about setting a deep and contented feeling centered directly on the product, about the peace of morning and the promise of a new day, clear skies, golden light (see the box photo), bunnies, puppies, galactic serenity, etc.<br /><br />The package: the box I got is different than the official one shown here.  I prefer the box I got over the one shown--the front panel is oriented more to the customer, instead of oriented on the manufacturer.  If you're set on Nature's Path, then you'll find this product anyway; the company logo and name don't need to dominate the front of the box.  As for the back panel, I dunno.  What does "the sweet breeze of a Mexican sunset" have to do with breakfast cereal?  Is this a travel cereal?  And what exactly is a travel cereal, and how do I get it through customs?  And what of the photos of a rain forest, a beach resort, a Mexican air mail stamp, and a sun-worshiping woman sitting in the dirt?  Is this cereal best enjoyed in Mexico, in the dirt?  That, and there's bold language about the "unique nutritional profiles of ancient grains . . .," although there is no further specification on what those profiles are, and why they are so totally extremely good for you.<br /><br />I do note that the front of the box, the top and one side panel call this product "Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise," while the back-panel copy calls it "Vanilla Sunrise Crunch."  Which one is it?  I prefer the latter, actually.<br /><br />The flavor dry out of the box isn't bad, and it would be an okay bagged snack for a hike or for a school lunch.  It was better in milk, in my case the standard 2%.  The very first thing I noticed is that this cereal separates in milk.  Now me, I like a lot of milk, as I like that all-important crunchiness toned down a bit, and I like to drink the cereal-flavored milk when I'm done.  If you're a sparse cereal-milker, then this won't be a problem for you.  With more milk the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GCSKKE">Kix</a>- and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004078WRW">Krispies</a>-like bits float, while the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZXCFQ6">flakes</a> sink.  You've got to actively stir and dredge the bottom of the bowl to get your fully mixed cereal bounty promised in the box photo.<br /><br />And the taste: I thought it was great.  Very nice taste, with just the right amount of vanilla coming through.  Dry or in milk, it is slightly sweet to begin with.  I added a little bit of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FMMTHU">Equal</a> to sweeten it up a bit more.  The texture is a little screwy, with the crispies and flakes and puffs all mixing together, but once you start masticating, it's no longer an issue.<br /><br />Nutrition: I've provided a photo of the panel, so you sort it all out.  The one thing that I notice is that there are more than 100 calories in a single, tiny serving, and that's before you even add the milk.  No wonder it tastes sweet.  And it's officially and certifiably organic, etc.<br /><br />Bottom line: Sure, I'd eat this cereal again.  It's apparently good for me, which is a plus, and it tastes great.  But at more than $5 per box, and a small box at that, it's awfully spendy.

review/summary: A tasty dessert but way too sweet for breakfast
review/text: I opened this gluten free cereal expecting a variation on granola.  Way too sweet and light to boot- more corn puffs and rice krispies meets a splash of flaxseeds. If I were to take this in the morning I'd go into insulin overdrive, even with milk to slow it down.  But I'd be crashing by mid morning and overeating at noon, both dangerous activities for gluten-free people in a non-gluten-free world.<br /><br />2/3 cup is counted as a serving although you will probably eat a full cup like most cereals since it is light, boosting the calories from 110 to 165.  Actually most will probably go over a cup. The fiber content of 3g per 2/3 cup is okay, but you'd do better with a green smoothie made with whole fruit, nuts and veggies.  There are 7g of sugar (11.5 if you take a cup)- organic evaporated cane juice and molasses are just as bad as high fructose corn syrup in terms of raising your blood sugar and blood insulin levels, except it won't have pesticide residues and you might pick up a hint of a mineral or two from the molasses.  It has 25g of carbs (37.5 per cup) which will quickly convert to sugar.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the stuff is tasty.  I tasted it then blew my diet with a large bowl of it. (Note to self: don't review Amazon food products on an empty stomach.) The corn puffs won't be GMO and the grains are organic.  But use it as a dessert. It isn't good for you, unless you are using it to replace Cocoa Puffs. If you want a good breakfast that will sustain you until lunch and avoids gluten, fry a couple of eggs sunny side up in coconut oil and serve over greens or tomato and nori.  Your blood sugar will thank you.  Save this for a treat, to deter you from your roommate's conventional cookies when your willpower is weak.

I wanted to try out this cereal because I love any cereal that doubles as a granola. I loved it. It was sweet enough for kids who are used to sugary cereals but without the caloric and diabetic mess. It was best with almond milk, although greek yogurt was excellent with it as well. The best part? My wife loved it and is making it part of her everyday healthy diet, although I can't say much for whatever fad diet will come next week, she's sticking to this one. I give it one star less because there is not enough cereal in this tiny box.

review/summary: Good Tasting Cereal
review/text: Nature's Path new breakfast product, Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise, is a good tasting cereal that is "gluten free."  It tastes lightly sweetened, a combination of corn flakes, crispy rice, and crunchy puffed corn. The crunchy and chewy texture is maintained in milk for several minutes even though the food is gluten free. The cereal is sweetened with cane juice and molasses. The ingredients include: corn, rice, flax, quinoa, buchwheat, and amaranth. There is 1g of fat (no saturated fat) 25g of carbs and 2g of protein per serving of 2/3 cup. There is an important warning that the cereal is produced in a facility that uses peanuts, tree nuts, and soy.<br /><br />Like many organic cereal products today, the price point is substantial for the 10.6 oz box. I ate the cereal with side dishes of Greek yogurt, blueberries and boysenberries, and walnuts. The cereal's flavor held its own against these other foods, and I will buy it in the future.

review/summary: Great tasting, but probably won't buy again...
review/text: We love regular Mesa Sunrise, so we had to try the Vanilla version.  It has a good flavor and my daughter thinks it tastes awesome.  However, I probably won't buy it again because the mixture is mostly Gorilla Munch and Crispy Rice and there is not enough Mesa Sunrise (even less than the picture on the box shows).  We like Gorilla Munch and Crispy Rice, but I bought this because I expected Mesa Sunrise to be the main type of cereal in the mix.<br /><br />Also, even though the product is sold by weight, the packaging is rather deceptive as it is twice as big of a box than it needs to be.  The bag is half full, and that isn't just because of settling!  Expect perhaps 2-4 bowls per box depending on if it is adult or child portions.  We buy the regular Mesa Sunrise in, what Nature's Path calls, "ECO PACS"; following that logic, the packaging of the Vanilla Sunrise should be called "Anti-ECO."  Still, I give it five stars because it has a great taste, it just wasn't quite what we were hoping for!

review/summary: Good snack for later in the day
review/text: According to the front of my package, Organic Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise mix contains lots of good stuff like corn, rice, flax, quinoa, buckwheat and amaranth.  OK, I don't know what the last one is (a combo of amaretto and absinthe?), but it sounds healthy.  Plus it's gluten-free.  I still don't know why this is a good thing, but I see this claim a lot, so I'm pretty sure the lack of gluten is a positive. The calorie count is 110 a bowl, according to the package, with 10 of those being from fat.  The overall flavor is vanilla, but as it says, you shouldn't confuse "vanilla" with "ordinary."  Fair enough.<br /><br />My first impression upon tasting the mix was that it was surprisingly sweet, but that's subjective depending on how sugary you like your breakfast.  The aftertaste wasn't bad, washed down with coffee.  I plan on finishing the box, but will have it as either a midday or evening snack, after my tastebuds have woken up a bit more.  Sunrise is a little early for me to consume something so sweet.

review/summary: Good for people with gluten intolerance and not so good for Pre-diabetics
review/text: I have never written a review for cereal so here goes. I have enjoyed eating several different cereals made by Nature's Path.<br /><br />The price is a little high for me but I am excited to the company's committment to be organic ingredients and having a great source of fiber and very desirable ingredients such as flax, amaranth, quinoa.<br /><br />It tastes like it has a bit too much vanilla. I would prefer less pronounced flavors. The vanilla taste goes very well with bananas but sort of clashes with the strawberries and blueberries that I usually but on my cereal. I usualy eat cereal with greek yogurt and it seemed to go well with it. I will mix the rest of the cereal with another without so much flavor. I do love buckwheat and wouldn't mind more of a buckwheat flaver. Not so sure that I like to think that I am eating vanilla cookies when I am eating cereal.<br /><br />The sugar is 7 grams which is just a bit too sweet for me as I am a prediabetic. Cane sugar and molasses, even if they are organic are not great for diabetics and others who need to watch their carbs. I would like to suggest to the company to add a little banner on the cereals that are best for diabetics and pre-diabetic. I think that would be very helpful and might increase their sales.<br /><br />The nutritional pluses are many, this cereal is very low in fat, 1 gram, has no chloesterol, the sodium is 130 mg which is pretty good. But since I am seeking more fiber, I would pick one of the other cereals they make over this one because the fiber is only 3mg, it is too sweet for me and I need a higher protein cereal.

review/text: We love granola and organic cereals in our house, and I have reviewed other types of cereals for Amazon before.  We have several boxes of Nature's Path cereals and granola in our pantry right now, but this one will not be kept in our rotation.  Let me start by saying that I appreciate the good-for-you ingredients that Nature's Path uses in their cereals.  They  are usually pretty low in fat, the sugar is not off the charts like most commercially prepared, highly sugared brands, and you can actually read the list of ingredient without finding lost of additives, preservatives, and just plain bad for you ingredients--they are spot on when it comes to that stuff.  The cereal ingredients read like a Who's Who List of great for you foods you should be eating.  It's just the taste of this cereal that has lead me to a less than stellar review.<br /><br />I tried some of the cereal before adding any milk to it, and my first thought was that the cereal had a very fake sugar smell to it.  The bigger puffs in the box reminded me of Cap'n Crunch and it was certainly not the taste I was going for.  When adding the milk, the cereal got soggy faster that I had hoped, and the flavor seemed non-descript.  I know the box says Vanilla Sunrise, but there was absolutely no hint of vanilla, and the after taste left me feeling like I ate some really fake cereal.  This is not what I am used to with Nature's Path products.<br /><br />I can highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006J4MAKY">Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries 11.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, a product I have already reviewed, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049D3YTS">Nature's Path Organic Acai Apple Granola with Pomegranate, 11.5-Ounce Boxes, (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006SPAH6I">Natures Path Pomegranate Plus Granola (1x25lb)</a>., but I can not recommend this cereal.

I found this to be a pleasant tasting cereal with a good crunch.  It is made almost exclusively of organic ingredients, and nothing on the nutrition label seems out of line.  Here's the bonus:  it is also gluten free.  I have a family member on a gluten free diet, and it is nice to have an option that is affordable, tastes good, healthy, and gluten free.  So you may be wondering, "Is there a downside?"  The only thing to be cautious about is the cost.  The box of cereal is only 10.6 oz., and it is not cheap (however nothing gluten free is).  Other than the cost, there's really nothing not to like.  I recommend this to anyone looking for something healthy, gluten free, and vanilla flavored.

review/summary: bad aftertaste, underfilled box
review/text: I went on a gluten-free diet a while ago and one thing that didn't impress me, was just how expensive it all was, and how puny the boxes were. I'm sorry to say, but Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla is yet another underfilled box of mediocre cereal with an oddly cloying vanilla-y aftertaste that tastes slightly burnt. Yes there are a number of different grains inside. Yes, the concept is a good idea, but taste is the most important thing for me, and this tastes bad. In fact, 20 minutes after I had it for breakfast, I still taste that weird vanilla flavor.<br /><br />I guess if you must eat gluten-free and the idea of a vanilla cereal is appealing, you might give this a whirl. But for me, when I buy a bag of cereal and the box is tiny and at least 1/3 air, then I feel that I've been cheated, regardless of possible explanations of settling. This box is puny enough as it is, without the underfilling.<br /><br />I didnt like it. It tasted bad, and when I buy cereal, I want a full box.

review/summary: A delicious vanilla cereal that's not just for breakfast!
review/text: A warm, real vanilla breakfast cereal with a variety of crunchy textures ranging from flakes to puffs to crispies. Oh, did I mention REAL vanilla?? And organic?? AND....it's GLUTEN FREE! An amazingly tasty, organic, gluten free cereal! We are all entitled to our opinion, thus the variety of reviews. However, where a comparison was made between Special K (vitamins) and this cereal (lack thereof), I need to say that Special K is not organic. You can't really compare the two (again, just *my* opinion).<br /><br />This cereal rocks with soy milk, or if you really want an extra sweet treat, vanilla almond milk! We eat this straight up, right out of the box too. It's great as a little pick me up snack in the middle of the afternoon....anyway you eat Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise cereal, you can't go wrong.

review/summary: I Enjoyed Eating This Cereal
review/text: I really enjoyed this cereal.  It has crispy flakes, seeds, puffs and other textures that make a nice combination.  One thing I especially appreciated was that the vanilla flavor was not overdone.  Other cereals say vanilla and then it is too much vanilla.  This vanilla was just right.  Another thing I appreciated was that the cereal is not hard on my teeth.  Some granola-type cereals are so crunchy and hard that I hurt my teeth.  This was the perfect texture. I recommend this product and will purchase it again.

review/text: When I got ready to try this cereal, I got a bit nervous reading the box.  Clearly, a product with all organic ingredients, nothing artificial, that's high in fiber and has omega-3s was going to be good for me, but how would it taste?  At first bite I was very pleasantly surprised.  The cereal has a great, crispy-puffy texture and a vanilla sweetness that I'm pretty sure even kids would like.  It gives me energy to get through the morning and keeps me full til lunchtime.  It would be great as a snack or even a crunchy topping for vanilla ice cream.  I enjoy eating this every morning and will definitely buy this cereal in the future.

review/summary: Possibly the best `healthy' cereal out there right now...
review/text: I'm still trying to figure out how this cereal tastes like a rice crispy treat.  I mean, this is healthy and delicious, and that isn't to say that other healthier cereals don't taste good, but this one is exceptional because it doesn't have that earthy `healthy' taste to it.  It tastes sugary and sweet and like dessert.  This cereal hits all marks for me.  It coats my mouth with wonderful sweetness and the contrasting textures are delightful on my tongue.  I love the rice puffs that pop in your mouth.  For a cereal that is gluten free, low in calories and sugar content, this is remarkable.  One of the best cereals that I have ever eaten, and sure to be a household staple here.  We love cereal, and my entire household agrees that this is TOP NOTCH.  Some may find the sweetness a little rich, and so a smaller bowl may be necessary, but a serving size does the trick, and thus the box can last a little longer.

review/text: This cereal tastes very good. It has some fiber, but not a lot, which is good. Many people don't want high fiber cereal. Others do not want a low fiber cereal, so this one meets both requirements; it has just the right amount of fiber, 3g.<br /><br />My only complaint is that part of it is buffed balls, so the box does not have the same weight as other boxes of natural cereal. Otherwise, I highly recommend this cereal.

review/text: It's possible that this product is aimed at children: with its cloying super-sweetness and otherwise bland, cardboard-like taste, it resembles Trix, the cereal so loved by that Silly Rabbit. But the hype of the cereal seems aimed at adults, with its "Nature's Path" brand and claims of gluten-free whole grain goodness and flax seed. For me, the real question is, why bother? There are so many yummy gluten free cereals now on the market, my favorites being Trader Joe's varieties of GF granola, which are delicious, that this product will not be on my radar screen. It's just not tasty enough to compete.

review/summary: There are better choices out there
review/text: This cereal is masquerading as healthy.  Yes, it is organic and gluten-free, but it also is a processed food containing a fair amount of sugar at 7g per serving (second ingredient is organic evaporated cane juice) and gets its fiber from added inulin (and maybe additional sweetening from this ingredient), rather than just from whole grains.  The major grain constituents of corn meal/flour and brown rice flour are not the healthiest grain ingredients but might be needed to get a decent gluten free cereal (this contains no oats, which are also gluten free).  The amount of fiber per serving is 3g, not too great for a healthy cereal.  This is not a fortified cereal, so Vitamin A, C and calcium are 0% and iron only 4% of RDA.<br /><br />The package is somewhat deceptive in that it lists a serving as having relatively low calories (110 calories), but the reason becomes evident when looking into the serving size.  The cereal serving size is 2/3c = 30g = 1.10 oz, which is smaller when compared to standard natural cereal serving sizes (which I have found to be more in the 1.5 to 1.8 oz range), so this is the reason that the calories appear lower.  Possibly this serving size may be more appropriate for children.  As an adult, eating only 1.10 oz of this cereal does not fill me up.<br /><br />The cereal tastes pretty good, if you like a sweet cereal, and I think kids would like this.  It appears to be a mixture of organic versions of Kix (hollow corn spheres), tiny Rice Krispies and some kind of fiber flakes, with tiny bits of other stuff (possibly sugar coated puffed quinoa etc).  Maybe it has a hint of vanilla flavor, but it mostly tasted sweet to me.  It was quite good with fresh sliced strawberries on top and regular milk.  The cereal did not appear as appetizing as the glossy photo on the package.<br /><br />The box is only 10.6oz, so it won't last long if increasing the amount per serving and thus is not the best value.  I suppose this cereal may be a good option for people who need a tasty/sugary gluten-free cereal.  But there certainly are healthier and cheaper options out there (even standard oatmeal).  Rated 2 1/2 stars, rounded down to 2 stars.

review/summary: Where's The Vanilla???
review/text: I was pretty excited about trying this product.  I like most of the nature's path products that I've tried but I try to avoid the products that contain natural flavors.  The only gluten free cereal they carry that doesn't contain natural flavors are their Peanut Butter Panda Puffs.  Of course Nature's Path makes way way way better cereal than the conventional brands, but I am very fussy about what I put into my body & don't want to pay top dollar for additives.<br /><br />At first bite I was disappointed.  My first thought was, "This doesn't taste like vanilla at all."  I kept eating & then thought it tasted odd. It is hard to describe but there is a slight lingering bitterness. I doubt I will eat this again.  To make matters worse, it is not filling at all.  I usually juice in the morning & find juicing is more filling than this.  Plus juicing is much more nutritious.  I also don't care for the addition of inulin or vitamin e.<br /><br />Last there is nothing like a cereal calling itself Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise & it doesn't even contain vanilla!  Nature's Path says (on the back of the box) "Please don't confuse "vanilla" with "ordinary."  Maybe we should ask Natures Path if they are confused about what real vanilla is.  Ingredients as per the box:  Organic whole grain corn meal, organic evaporated cane juice, organic brown rice flour, organic yellow corn flour, organic inulin, organic quinoa puffs, organic flax seeds, natural vanilla flavor (natural vanilla flavor does not equal organic vanilla from an organic vanilla bean), organic buckwheat flour, organic quinoa, sea salt, organic amaranth, organic molasses, tocopherols (natural vitamin E) (lets hope the E is from GMO free sources!).<br /><br />A much healthier gluten free option is to make your own hot cereal & add REAL organic vanilla.  My favorite is Organic Raw Sun Cured Whole Vanilla Bean Powder.  I use it all the time.  Cereal, tea, smoothies you name it!  If you have a food mill you can even make your own rice cereal by simply grinding the rice to flour & cooking it just as you would the hot rice cereal you buy in the store.  Oatmeal is another tasty option.  The bonus is not only does it taste amazing but in the end you save tons of money & eat organic.  It's a win win!

review/summary: Don't walk down Nature's Path...
review/text: Other reviewers have gotten into more specifics regarding nutrition, so I'm not gonna flog a dead horse with any more specifics.  Here's the bottom line:<br /><br />This cereal is packaged in a way to give the impression that it is natural and therefore healthy.  It is NOT a very healthy option for your breakfast.<br /><br />However, despite the unfortunate attempts at deception from the packaging, I can say that this cereal was really tasty, so for flavor alone, it'll get 3 stars.<br /><br />I won't be buying it again though, not only because I don't want to support a company that charges a higher price for sugary cereal on the false basis that its somehow better for you than all those more common sugary cereals, but also because I probably only got two bowls of cereal out of this box and it's hardly worth the price for two days of breakfast.

This stuff tastes great.  It is very crunchy, and has a wholesome sweetness to it.  I loved it, the kids loved it, and my wife loved it.  I ate it every day until the box was empty.  Will you like it?  I can't say, because taste is well ... a matter of taste.

review/summary: Mmmmm...A Little Sweet, But....Good!
review/text: I love cereal--I mean, I can't believe I am saying this, but I actually love breakfast cereals more as an adult than when I was a kid. Sometimes, I have cereal for dinner when I am not feeling too hungry. I am more of a "Special K" kind of dude just to let you know and I am really not into all the "organic food" hoopla that has been making waves in the media for the past few years.<br /><br />Took a chance and got a new cereal that is "gluten-free" (whatever that meant) and is `USDA organic'. Again, I eat what I eat because I want to, and I try to maintain a balanced diet. I am not all into this obsessive healthy diet, but I have to admit I was very impressed with Nature's Path "Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise".<br /><br />I don't know how to start a review on cereal. Well, this stuff tastes really good and is lightly sweet (but it leaves a sweeter after taste). You can really taste the natural flavors around it. The corn, rice, flax, quinoa, buckwheat and amaranth are all blended together pretty well and the flavors do go well with each other. It has that `crunch' that I usually go for and while I don't have a kid, I can say that maybe a kid will like this cereal. I even topped it with some blueberries and bananas at times, and boy, it tastes even better. Also, one thing I look for is the fact that it does not get soggy for awhile after being immersed in milk. It kept its crunchy texture (but smooth) while I was eating it. One complaint, the vanilla taste is a little subtle, and I could taste more honey in it.<br /><br />Now keep in mind, I only had one bowl of this cereal to do this review, so just how I'll feel about it after repeat servings, is yet to be told. I cannot say anything about its "repeat servings" as of yet.<br /><br />Very impressed with this product and I think I may just have to use this as a snack even without milk. It is good....like what I like with my cereals. It is a little pricey at $ 10 a box, but hey, it is one of great quality. It is up to you if a cereal for $ 10 is worth it.

review/text: This cereal is far too sweet for me.  I was barely able to eat the first (and only) bowl I poured for myself.  Not wanting to waste it, I have been mixing small amounts in with my trail mix, but there is no way I could eat another bowl of this.<br /><br />Anytime the second ingredient listed on the box is a sweetener, in this case evaporated cane juice, I have to wonder what flavors they're trying to mask with the cloying sweetness.  With a combination of corn, brown rice, amaranth, quinoa, flax seeds, and buckwheat I think there would be plenty of potential for good flavor combinations.  Unfortunately, all I could taste was the sugar.

review/summary: Delicious, but less than half a bag each?!
review/text: While I don't buy 'real' healthy cereals very often, I'm always up for trying new ones. And face it- when there's a cereal called Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise, it pretty much tells you that you're in for a good meal. With high expectations...I was right. So right, that I took care of the whole box within a day. No, THAT wasn't a very healthy thing to do, but my god was this cereal great. It looked like some kind of rabbit food when I poured some into a bowl, but upon taking the first bite, I was in love. Crunchy, but not super crunchy. Vanilla, but not super vanilla-y. Sunrise...well, the sun -was- shining when I was eating it!<br /><br />There are only so many things you can say about a food that you like in a review, because the only way if you know you'll like it is by getting some for yourself. Anyone who loves vanilla flavored cereals should like this stuff. It seems like a lot of people here aren't too big on the taste, but I didn't have any problems with it at all. As soon as my first bowl was over, I moonwalked back to the kitchen and poured another. It's a heck of a lot lower in sugar than nearly everything else I get, though I suppose health nuts will always find something to throw a fit about.<br /><br />I was on the fence on giving it 3 or 4 stars because I love the flavor so much, but there's one glaring problem. Someone posted an image above in the Customer Images section, and that's exactly how my cereal was as well. And if you're one of those people that really does go by the Serving Size listed on the size of the box, this stuff isn't going to fill you up very well. When you see how much you're getting by buying a pack of 3 here...for the price, it doesn't seem like a good deal compared to buying 2 bigger boxes of a similar cereal.<br /><br />Problems aside, if you don't mind buying this stuff in bulk, you should be happy.

review/summary: Yummy Yummy for my Tummy Tummy
review/text: To put this simply, this breakfast cereal is absolutely delicious.  I at times become dubious with all natural and organic products, because natural and organic might be good for you but it doesn't equate to good taste.  However this cereal is really very tasty and it is healthy.  In addition, it really isn't loaded with calories and sugar.  A plus is this product is also cholesterol and gluten free.<br /><br />This cereal is a combination of puff rice, corn (?) flakes and puffed oats (?).  The flavor is rather sweet and no too much of an overbearing taste of vanilla.  The box displayed the cereal with bananas, so I decided to eat mine with bananas and use almond soy milk. YUM!!! Wow, what a real treat this cereal is. Again it is nice that this natural and organic breakfast cereal doesn't taste like cardboard.<br /><br />The one set back is the size of the box; it is barely 11oz and not for nothing but the bag was just about half full.  I can maybe understand Nature's Path wanting to make a smaller package for cost and profit but fill the bag up.  I do not believe my bag was 10.6oz.  I suppose that is the price of eating well.  Maybe that is why this country has such an obesity problem.  I digress, this is an excellent tasting product and if I was certain my next box would be more than half full, I would grab it in a heart beat.

review/summary: Good Pedigree. OK taste
review/text: Though I don't need to eat gluten free foods, I know people who do and can remember a time when there were less choices and those on a gluten free diet had to settle. Those days are long gone. Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise is gluten free, organic, free of synthetic pesticides and herbicides, free of irradiation, and even is packed in an Enviro Box. And the list of "good" stuff goes on and one.<br /><br />But what about the taste? My first impression is that it's overly sweet, sure to be a hit with kids. As I finished off the box, I got more used to the sweetness and it became less obtrusive. Sprinkling a handful of unsweetened blueberries on top of my bowl of cereal actually hit the spot quite nicely.<br /><br />The cereal is pleasantly crunchy and its variety of shapes and textures and cereal types adds some visual interest also. As I reach the bottom of the box, I ponder whether I would buy a new replacement box. Since the taste of this crunchy vanilla sunrise is more OK than outstanding, I'd probably only buy it if it could be had for a outstanding sale price.

review/summary: Disappointed by the overly sweet taste and vanilla aftertaste.
review/text: I'm already a fan of the Nature's Path organic cereals but have not seen this one in the store.  I don't know if that means it is a new product or just that my mega-monopoly chain (the only grocery chain we have in town) just doesn't stock this one.  I have tried four or five of the different varieties of Nature's Path and have enjoyed them with varying degrees of success.  I'm sorry to say this is the one I like least and I'm disappointed.<br /><br />First off, there are only 10.6 ounces of cereal in the box.  Compared to the normal 14 ounce weight in other products by this brand that makes this box a little short on quantity.  I think that is probably because of the puffed grains which take up more volume in the box.  There are puffs, flakes, and grain/seed shapes.  The  impression I got with the first bite of dry cereal was *sweet*.  In fact, very sweet. The sweetness is sprayed on each component in the mix and adds up to more sweet taste than I like.  The smell I got was *vanilla*.  Once I poured the milk on my 2/3 cup portion size the cereal stayed crunchy for quite a long time, but eventually it did get soggy.  I think that's simply something you have to accept with flake shapes in a cereal.  I thought it was too sweet and the vanilla flavoring left a decided aftertaste which is rather unpleasant.<br /><br />This is a gluten free cereal which can be very important to people with gluten intolerance or allergies.  I'm seeing more and more cereals with this attribute so that's got to be a very good thing.  The numbers on this cereal aren't very impressive otherwise.  The grain mix is organic whole grain corn meal, organic brown rice flour, organic yellow corn flour, organic quinoa puffs, organic flax seeds, organic buckwheat flour and organic amaranth.  In addition to the organic evaporated cane juice there is also organic molasses.  I have to admit to not knowing what organic inulin is.  At 110 calories per 2/3 cup serving that is neither good nor bad, it has 12g of whole grains of the recommended 48g per day, again, neither good nor bad.  Total fat is 1g, but the vitamin and mineral counts are either very low or non-existent.  It is certified USDA Organic and the company is going out of it's way to promote the family farms in rural communities.  All very good, but it doesn't actually make this particular cereal taste very good.<br /><br />I buy other Nature's Path cereals and enjoy them very much.  This one does not have that holding power to keep away hunger until lunch time that I'm looking for.  For me it tastes too sweet to eat as a snack dry from the box plus some of those seeds are itty bitty, so I'll finish off this box as a breakfast food in a bowl with milk, a dollop of yogurt and some fresh fruit and then go back to my other varieties that I like more.  And the aftertaste is really quite pronounced.  That I don't care for at all.<br /><br />EDIT:  I looked up organic inulin and found that it is an organic agave sweetner.  Yikes!  THREE sweetners in this cereal??

review/summary: Not Very Good Taste
review/text: I eat cereal every day and always look for different varieties which are low fat and with new flavors so I was excited to get these. First Amazon does not ship dry packaged goods well. This is one of several boxes of food that has arrived at my house either crushed or in crumbs. After getting beyond the look, the flavor left a bitter after taste. I enjoy vanilla, but I suspect that the extract in the cereal created this effect. The cereal itself includes flakes, rice crisps and puffs-too much going on for one cereal. The manufacturer needs to stick with one look and perfect that.<br /><br />All in all I would not recommend this cereal. There are better ones out there and for less money too.

review/summary: So so---vanilla flavor tastes fake
review/text: I wanted to like this cereal--it has fiber and whole grains and no gluten and and and. It consists of little flakes sort of like Special K, little vanilla "cocoa puffs" style spheres, and Rice Krispies dealies. It has 7 grams of sugar per serving, which is more than the 3 grams nutritionists recommend, but far less than many other cereals. Only 3 grams of dietary fiber (from gas-producing inulin--not a natural foodstuff, btw) and 2 of protein are kind of measly for this kind of cereal, but the biggest drawback for me is the vanilla flavor--it tastes off--like cheap, fake vanilla, although the ingredients list says it's "natural vanilla flavor."<br /><br />Nature's Path? Hmm--not exactly the Road Less Travelled....

review/summary: Crunchy, lots of different textures, but a bit too much vanilla
review/text: I LOVE cereal! I also like vanilla and frequently put a splash of vanilla extract in my coffee.<br /><br />Although this cereal sounds perfect, I didn't like it that much.  It wasn't bad, but it was not my taste.  I am giving it 4 stars because, although I didn't like it there is nothing inherently bad about it and taste is so subjective.<br /><br />Anyway, here are some pro and cons (really? pros and cons about a cereal...it can be done)<br /><br />Pros:<br />Crunchy, softens slightly in milk (yet doesn't turn into a slushy mess)<br />Widely varied textures that make it really nice to chew<br />Gluten free for those on a restricted diet<br /><br />Cons:<br />Taste was a bit too vanilla for me<br />Sticky when eaten dry out of the box (not great for snacking)

review/summary: Iffy
review/text: The mail lady delivered my sample box of this cereal just as we were finishing lunch, so my husband and I both had some for dessert.<br /><br />Some reviewers have commented on a burnt flavour: I think they're tasting the buckwheat. Buckwheat is not my favourite grain and it was really rather potent as I started eating the bowl, but seemed to wear off as I got close to done eating. My husband noticed that the coating on the cereal wore off and left his water all flavourful that he poured on his (I had mine with soy milk). The cereal didn't have much taste outside of the sweet coating; I did not find that it was too sweet too start with. I couldn't taste any vanilla at all. My husband thought the sodium content was a bit excessive (130mg per serving).<br /><br />I do think it's a bit overpriced for what you get and the fact that it's really not *that* impressive of a taste. I really like the Mesa Sunrise corn flakes and was expecting something a little more akin to that, so in that regard I was disappointed. Still, this wasn't horrible cereal. I wouldn't go out and buy it, but I would eat it again were it to be at someone's house, because with all the grains it's still a better option than most highly refined commercial cereals.

review/summary: Good, not great - would probably buy again....
review/text: I have to eat gluten free, so this was something I was looking forward to.  It was good, but not great, in my opinion.  Somehow, the little crunchy balls did not go well with the flakes - it was like I'd mixed two different cereals.  Some people may not mind that at all, I just happen to prefer the same texture in a breakfast cereal.<br /><br />I liked that the ingredients were (typical of Nature's Path) a cut above most anything found on regular grocery store shelves.  And the fact that it's organic is a huge plus.<br /><br />The subtle vanilla flavor was not overpowering, and the cereal did not require anything else on it (extra sugar, maple syrup, etc.).  I happen to use vanilla flavored almond milk, and the extra vanilla flavor was not too much.  Regardless of what it's in (milk, nut milk, soy milk, etc.), it is great all by itself.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Yes, for variety.  But I purchase several Nature's Path products in the large eco-packs to save time and packaging, and even if these become offered in the large eco-pack bags, I don't expect to be buying that much at a time.  Again - nothing at all wrong with them - actually quite good - it's just not going to be my favorite breakfast cereal.

review/summary: Yummy, but with a bit of an after taste.
review/text: This is a gluten free product.  I have never had a gluten free product nor do I have any medical need for one.<br /><br />This was a yummy, crunchy cereal.  As an out of the box snack, it was a little sticky, so be prepared to have to wash your hands or have wipes.  It held up well in milk, but by the end of the bowl (which was the recommended size) it was getting a little soggy.<br /><br />The cereal does have a very strong, but not unpleasant, aftertaste of vanilla.  This was less noticeable in milk than from the box.  If vanilla is not your thing, you probably wouldn't like this.  But if you like vanilla, you will.  I would get this again, even though I do not need gluten free food.

review/summary: Delicious Cereal
review/text: Nature's Path "Organic Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise" is a delicious cereal.<br /><br />Unfortunately cereals are not healthy, but as far as cereals go this is one of the better ones.<br /><br />The sugar to fiber ratio is 2.3 to 1 (7 grams of sugar for every 3 grams of fiber).  The "best" cereals are about 1:1.  As a rule of thumb I won't eat anything with a sugar to fiber ratio higher than 3 to 1, so Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise qualifies as acceptable.<br /><br />If you are going to eat cereal, this is a good organic choice.<br /><br />I'm very impressed by Nature Path's program to buy land and allow organic farmers to use the land for free.<br /><br />The primary ingredient in Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise is corn. ("organic whole grain corn meal")  Followed by sugar and then organic brown rice flour.  There are eleven more ingredients and none of them are "incomprehensible chemical names".  The only potentially "bad" ingredient is "natural vanilla flavor" (which technically could be darn near anything).<br /><br />All in all, a fairly good cereal with a very nice flavor.  Enjoy it in moderation.

review/summary: Good Taste, Lower Protein, Lower Sugar, Higher Price, Gluten Free!
review/text: This is a good tasting cereal with lots of nice crunch. Compared to a granola or GoLean Crunch, it gets soggy a little faster, on par with a regular flake cereal, such as Special K. But other than that, it is a nice addition to a  gluten free pantry.  I added dried cranberries, and thought it tasted good.<br /><br />We don't have to be gluten free, but we try to cut down here and there. I use soy milk on my cereal, and I'm going to compare Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise to my favorite cereal, GoLean Crunch, by Kashi.<br /><br />Vanilla Sunrise is quite a bit more expensive than GoLean Crunch. The boxes are about the same size, but one Sunrise holds 10.6 oz, while GoLean holds 15 oz, which means there was a bit of empty space in the Sunrise box. (I realize that, from the grocer's point of view, they like having boxes approximately the same size.)<br /><br />I compared amazon prices for the two cereals (which of course can change): 3 boxes Sunrise cost $0.35 per ounce. 4 boxes of GoLean cost $0.22 per ounce.<br /><br />Here's the comparison of some nutrition amounts for one cup of Sunrise to one cup of GoLean. You can compare these numbers to your favorite cereal:<br /><br />Calories:  165 Sunrise,  190 GoLean<br /><br />Sodium:  195mg Sunrise,  100mg GoLean<br /><br />Carbohydrates total:  37g Sunrise,  37g GoLean<br /><br />Carbohydrates from sugar:  10g Sunrise,  13g GoLean<br /><br />Protein:  3g Sunrise,  9g GoLean<br /><br />Overall, this is a tasty cereal and I like having the occasional gluten free choice.

review/text: With so many options for breakfast fare, it's great to see more available in gluten-free.  This one is packed with very healthy grains such as quinoa and actually tastes good.  It has a lot of vanilla flavor, which may or not be a hit for you, I found it a little overly cloying with milk but overall a pleasantly tasting cereal for one so healthy.  Great for snacking on its own or even better in the traditional milk added breakfast, and would be especially good with fruit added.

review/summary: Tasty, but very sweet
review/text: The first thing that came to mind when I opened this box, is that the cereal looked like a mixture of Kix, rice crisps, and corn flakes.  Unlike those serials, Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise is very tasty. The sweetness with hints of vanilla is yummy.  Plus, unlike most "crunchy cereals" this one is nut free (but made in a factory where nuts are used).. an added bonus for those who can't have nuts.<br /><br />My only gripe about this cereal is that it is very sweet... almost too sweet.  The main ingredients are corn and sugar.  At 7g of sugar per 2/3 cup, I find it too sugary for a healthy cereal.  Because of the sugar content, I will probably pass in the future as I prefer Annie's Cinna Bunnies if I need a sugary treat.

review/summary: Healthy breakfast choice!
review/text: I am a big fan of eating cereal any time of the day, especially for breakfast. It's fast, convenient, and a healthy start to the day. I was excited about tasting this cereal because it is gluten-free and contains quinoa, which Dr. Oz says is a must for any diet. On first inspection, the cereal looks as if it's a combination of Corn Pops, Rice Krispies, and Wheaties. It has a lot going on in one box. In terms of taste, it has a vanilla flavoring that lingers in your mouth long after you have eaten it. Not very appealing! As for  the nutritional value, I was surprised at the lack thereof. Comparing Original Special K (serving size is one cup) to the Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise (serving size is 2/3 cup) without adding any milk, SK has 15% Vitamin A of the daily recommended amount and CVS has 0%. As for vitamin C, SK has 35% and CVS has 0% and sugars SK has 4g and CVS has 7g. It doesn't look like the Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise is all that healthy. Overall, if you like the taste, it's probably better than eating a sugary cereal; however, I wouldn't buy it.

review/summary: Good cereal that tastes good
review/text: With the typical Kellogg's or Post cereal, the choice mostly depends on taste.  With Nature's Path cereal, other considerations come into play.  This cereal is produced using no synthetic pesticides or herbicides, using no irradiation, contains no artificial preservatives or additives, and no genetically engineered seeds or ingredients.  It was produced on farms that use enriched drought resistant soil, produce less soil erosion, less groundwater pollution, and practice improved farm biodiversity.  If supporting products of this type matters for you, then you will probably be predisposed to buy this cereal.  Still, though, in the end it has to taste good if you are going to continue buying it.  I think it does taste very good.  The best way to describe the taste is as being like rice krispies, but with a strong vanilla flavor.<br /><br />So, if the price seems reasonable and you want to support this type of product, you won't find yourself sacrificing taste.

review/summary: Changed their formula: taste like Vanilla & Cornmeal
review/text: I love Nature's Path, however with this cereal I am not disappointed, but I am not impressed either.<br /><br />First off, if you take a look at the pictures, you see will see a good mix of Corn, Rice, Flax, Quinoa, Buckwheat & Amaranth. However, it appears that when Nature's Path change the look on their boxes, they also change their formula. Mines was about 70% cornmeal, 30% everything else. I have uploaded a photo so hopefully you can see what I saw (should be one of the very last photos in the gallery).<br /><br />Because mines was 70% cornmeal, the cereal DID taste like vanilla but it had a cornmeal aftertaste. If you take a long time with your cereal, slowly the vanilla transfers onto the milk, and the cereal mostly take like cornmeal.<br /><br />Now if you like the taste of corn, that's fine. But I was expecting more flavors particularly the flax and amaranth, but those flavors were lost in the mix.<br /><br />This product IS however 100% organic except for natural vanilla flavor, sea salt, and tocopherols (natural vitamin E). Compare to other cereals, it is low in calories (110), contains no cholesterol, and is high in fiber (12% of your daily values). However, because it is organic with very little added to it, it is low in nutrition compare to other non-organic cereals such as special K. It only has 4% iron (surprisingly, Vitamin E is not listed as a nutrition even though it is listed as an ingredient).<br /><br />Other pros of the cereal is that it contains 0.15g of Omega 3 per serving, which is 11% of the recommended daily value of 1.3g<br /><br />It is also gluten-free for those who can't consume gluten as well as certified USDA organic. My cereal box expired Nov 02 2012.<br /><br />The box says that Nature's Path change their boxes by making their packages smaller to reduce 10% of their impact on the planet by saving on water, energy and paperboard. However, I am also 100% convinced that their also change their formula to include more of the cheaper cornmeal and include less of the more expensive ingredients.

review/text: Okay so I got this because I was hoping for a healthy good tasting cereal.  Though I don't really buy into the gluten free hype (because I'm not allergic to wheat which is the only real reason to go gluten free) I figured that since I like Vanilla this might be a good option.<br /><br />Okay so first of all this is a cereal that is heavy on the sugar for something that looks "healthy" and for something with all of that sugar it certainly doesn't taste as good as it seems like it should.  This is like a grown up's kiddie cereal.  If you like it then go ahead and buy it, but don't believe that it's an overly healthy choice.  There are far tastier healthier choices on the market to go for.  This isn't something that I will be purchasing in the near future.

review/summary: Good, but too sweet
review/text: With the name "Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise" and touting various whole grains, I expected more of an "adult" cereal--wholesome and natural.  I was a little surprised to open it and see the air-puffed cereal.  If I can compare the cereal to other common ones, it's like a mix of Kix, Rice Krispies, and flakes all mixed together with vanilla flavor and a crunch. It does taste good, and I'm sure kids would like it.  In fact, it seems like their market should be for kids with health-conscious parents.<br /><br />I'm glad that Nature's Path is making a cereal using some less common grains (even though corn still is at the top of the list).  All the grains are organic and non-gmo.  This cereal is gluten-free, and I promise you won't miss the wheat.<br /><br />It has 7 grams of sugar per serving, which may be fine for some people, but it's too sweet for me.  It's sweetened with evaporated cane juice and molasses. I think they could cut some of the sugar and still have a delicious cereal because of its natural vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Try and see if you like it, but just don't expect a granola-like cereal.

review/text: My kids have to eat gluten-free, so we're always interested in trying new Gluten-free products. They were excited about this one and they both loved the flavor. Personally, i thought it had a good vanilla flavor, but just as strong was the flavor of flax seed and cardboard. Bleh.<br /><br />It's also frustrating that it only has 2 grams of protein per serving. That is no where near enough to sustain kids for longer than a half hour, so in addition to the cereal i still have to fix them something else with protein in it! When will breakfast-makers realize that MORE protein is ESSENTIAL for the morning meal?? This is a constant gripe of mine though, and not exclusive to this product.<br /><br />I DO appreciate the high quality of the ingredients that ARE present in the cereal and the low amount of sugar in it.<br /><br />Overall, it is a quality product from a GOOD company. But while it has an "okay" flavor, it just doesn't have enough substance for me to buy it again for my family.

review/summary: Nice, subtle flavor
review/text: This cereal reminded my kids of Rice Crispies in terms of flavor. It has flakes that resemble Corn Flakes, puff balls that resemble Kix, and rice puffs that resemble Ricke Crispies. The kids thought they were okay, but I am sure the flavor could definitely grow on them over time. They didn't reject eating it.<br />I really enjoyed the flavor. It was slightly sweet with a subtle vanilla flavor. I honestly liked them more for a dry snack in place of granola as opposed to having them with milk. In fact, adding in a few almonds this became a definite replacement for granola in a pinch.<br />If you are already a eater of more healthy cereal - this will be right up your alley. If you are looking to do a diet change from some of the more traditional (high sugar, highly processed) cereal - it may take a few tries to get your palate used to the flavor. Would definitely recommend at least giving it a try. Especially if you like a slightly sweet cereal as opposed to more sugar coated sort of cereals.

review/summary: Good Standby Breakfast
review/text: This cereal has a good flavor of vanilla without being overwhelming. I have had their granola before and it was a little too noisy and crunchy for me but this cereal is just a nice amount of flakes and puffs to be filling with a good texture, without feeling like your chewing forever at a loud decibel. It's not gonna rock your breakfast world but it is good nutrition when your a mindless morning zombie.

review/summary: Low-sugar never tasted this sweet!
review/text: I really enjoyed going through a box of Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise.  It is low in sugar and yet still very sweet.  While I'm not sure I tasted any vanilla in there, it was still pretty good.  It contains good ole flakes, small crunchies and mini-kix like cornballs.  Interestingly enough it also has Omega-3.  For a healthy, yet good tasting cereal, give Nature's Path a try today!

review/summary: too sugary for a "healthy" cereal
review/text: I was drawn to this cereal because it is a Nature's Path product.  I<br />enjoy their Flax Plus Multibran Flakes on a daily basis, so I<br />considered a 'crunchy vanilla' variety a welcome change of pace.  Both<br />products are touted as being whole grain, and both were advertised as<br />organic.<br /><br />A visual inspection of Vanilla Sunrise tipped me off to the play.<br />While the multibran flakes are an earthy brown, the sunrise spin is as<br />yellow as, well, the sun.  It seemed weaker in comparison.<br /><br />The first bite of Sunrise sealed the deal.  While Flax plus tastes<br />vaguely of a piece of bread, sunrise tastes like sugar cane.  This<br />might work if I was a kid switching down from Cocoa Puffs, but my<br />adult tongue felt somewhat burned by the sunrise.<br /><br />To their credit, crunchy vanilla sunrise is crunchy (although the flax<br />plus I'm sticking with is also suitably crunchy--without the added<br />sugar.)  Not recommended.

review/summary: loved by 20yo dd
review/text: I decided to give this healthy cereal a try although I am a sweet cereal lover. I recognized corn puffs and crisped rice; not sure what grain the flakes were. Overall the cereal stayed crunchy in milk and had a light vanilla taste without being overly sweet. The price is comparable to other organic products and seemed to be a better price than other GF products I've seen on the shelves. I was disappointed to see it was process in the same plant as peanuts/treenuts so those with allergies will have to skip Vanilla Sunrise. I give it 3 stars as good but just not my cup of tea.<br />My 20yo dd poured herself a bowl and was like WOW!!! *****<br />so that averages it out to 4 stars.

review/text: I tried Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise courtesy of Amazon Vine and really enjoyed it. There's lot of variety in the cereal, with all sorts of granola and cereal-type pieces. I'm not skilled enough at forensic cerealogy to identify all of them, but I do know enough to say that they all tasted great. This is a great breakfast treat, and it even works as a snack if you are so inclined.

review/summary: Delicious gluten-free cereal - would definitely recommend!
review/text: Organic Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise cereal from Nature's Path is GLUTEN-FREE and delicious!  It contains corn, rice, flax, quinoa, buckwheat & amaranth - 110 calories in a 2/3 cup portion, with little fat some sodium (130mg), 25g carbs, 3g of dietary fiber, 2g of protein and 7g of sugar.  The second ingredient is organic evaporated can juice, so that tells you a bit about the yummy sweetness: I ate this cereal with a bowl of lightly sweetened, vanilla coconut milk from TJ's, and found the total sweetness to be a bit too much for me in the morning: I would recommend this with unsweetened coconut milk or regular skim milk.<br /><br />This crunchy cereal is delicious, and is something I would make part of your diet as a snack, or as an occasional breakfast food- I try to eat more protein in the mornings to start my days off right (hello eggs!), so I would not recommend this to eat daily, but if you miss cereal and want to know of a good gluten-free cereal to satisfy your cereal craving, this is it!  This would be great if you added a sliced banana to it also: would definitely recommend Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise: yum!

review/summary: Good-tasting cereal, but not quite as healthy as advertised...
review/text: To start, let's just get the fact that I like the Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla surprise out of the way. It's good stuff and I finished the box off a good bit more quickly than I did with the last few boxes (other cereals). It has a sweet, light vanilla taste that actually had me looking forward to breakfast, and that's a good thing (I very often skip the meal, and that does me no favors). I know some say that it's way too  sweet for them, but if your idea of what a breakfast cereal ought to be isn't a bowl full of unsweetened nuts and twigs, this isn't all that terribly sweet. Slice up half a banana and go to town...as far as cereals go, it's a satisfying breakfast (or snack). Kids would likely be a fan of this cereal as well, so there's a bonus.<br /><br />Now, now that I've got how it tastes out of the way, Nature's Path loses a star on the nutrition side of things. Yes, this is a gluten-free cereal that could prove to be a great alternative for this with gluten sensitivity. It's also organic, so you know that the crops that went into making this were grown without pesticides, chemical fertilizers, etc. Unfortunately, organic and gluten-free does not amount to being healthy. There's not much fiber here (3g) and it's an unfortified cereal, so there's also a lot of vitamins that you're missing here. The serving size is also rather small, making the 7g of sugar start to loom a bit more menacingly. 7g isn't too awful, but if you're eating twice the serving size (and I have to admit, that's what I did), then 14g is a whole lot worse.<br /><br />All-in-all, Nature's Path Crunch Vanilla Sunrise is a good-tasting, kid-friendly cereal that's ultimately not as healthy as its marketing would seem to imply. While there are definitely less healthy options out there, this isn't quite the healthy breakfast option you were looking for.

review/summary: Overly sweet & over packaged
review/text: The cereal seemed to be overly sweet and more "kiddie" like than expected.  It is a healthier alternative to mainstream cereals for those who prefer a sweeter cereal, maybe a good middle ground.  The cereal was well received and eaten quickly by hubby and the kids (we normally eat organic or Kashi cereals).  I found it to be overly sweet and not very filling.  The bag was only 1/2 full so a little disappointed there as well.  Alternatively, Nature's path makes several organic cereals (without the corn puffs) they sell in a bag at Walmart (sadly not at Target or other stores, I prefer to shop at) that taste good and seem to be a much better bang for your buck.  They still are not as good for you as many other cereals but I feel that they are much better than eating typical kids cereals and good to mix with a healthier one or even for a kids snack.

review/text: This cereal is like crack for me. Very sweet, and I could eat half the box in one sitting if I had no self control... Which I kind of did when I first got it in the mail. (I've cut out a lot of added sugars from my diet, so when I have products like this, it tastes even sweeter to me).<br /><br />What I don't like: it's not very filling. I've had plenty of other cereals where I can snack on them without  milk, and after a certain amount, I'll be satisfied. But with this particular product, I am never satisfied and I still feel hungry... Even half a box later.<br /><br />With that said, would I buy this? No. I need foods that will leave me feeling full, and alas, it is too sweet for me to eat on a daily basis.

review/summary: kix + rice crispies + corn flakes + sugar + vanilla
review/text: This cereal looks like someone mixed together kix, rice crispies, and corn flakes. It tastes like they did that, then added sugar and some vanilla. I found it to be both very sweet (the second ingredient is sugar) and not very filling. It turned to mush within about five minutes, too, so unless you're a power-eater, it'll be soggy goop by the end of the bowl.<br /><br />I know that 'contents may settle', but the bag inside the box was only half full, which seemed a bit laughable. Based on what i poured in my cereal bowl, which i admit is far larger than the 'serving size' of 2/3 of a cup, each box contains about four breakfasts. If, however, you only eat 2/3 of a cup of cereal each morning, the box will last you much longer. (The ridiculously small serving size also explains why a cereal that tastes like it's mostly sugar only has 7 grams of sugar per serving.)<br /><br />There are precious few gluten-free cereals on shelves, but there has to be at least one that's better than this.

She liked the sweetness at first, though soon she was mixing it with other less-sweet organic cereals for better balance.<br /><br />It had too much vanilla for my taste. I like vanilla, but not as the primary flavor in a cereal. I expected it to be a bit more subtle.<br /><br />If you really like vanilla, and like sweet cereals, you may enjoy this one. If, like me, you prefer your breakfast cereal to have a heartier taste, I would not recommend it.

review/text: My sister-in-law is gluten free so I'm always on the look out for products she can eat whenever she comes for a visit. As more and more people are developing gluten sensitivity, it's nice that companies are producing more products that are gluten free. The cereal tasted pretty good. It has a hint of sweetness and vanilla. Honestly, it seemed a little bit like cereal on steroids, there were flakes, rice puffs (think rice crispies), little balls, etc. It kind of seemed like someone went through a cereal bar and just added a scoop of everything and mixed it up in the same box.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I'd buy it again though. Flavor-wise it was decent. It wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad. I liked that it's organic and G-free.

review/summary: Good Flavor, Doesn't Go Soggy
review/text: I found this surprisingly good, it didn't have that "I'm such a good health food that I taste like bamboo and cardboard" flavor. It doesn't go soggy in the first 30 seconds which is REALLY nice. And because it's gluten free, I didn't bloat out like when eating Kashi and other wheat cereals. And I found it just right sweetness-wise, not sure why other reviewers were coming down on it for that. Sweetness is subjective and I probably tolerate a higher level, so for comparison, I can eat Honey Nut Cheerios all day, but if you give me regular Cheerios then I need a bit of sugar or at least a banana thrown in there. If you prefer straight Cheerios out of the box, then you may find this a bit too sweet, but it's not like Frosted Flakes, lol.<br /><br />This is good, definitely one to buy again, although the selling price is a tad high becasue you only get 10 ounces in a box. But good food costs, so I guess I wouldn't expect this to be a buck a box. Enjoy!

review/summary: Tasty, crunchy, light & healthy!
review/text: We look for a few things when picking out a breakfast cereal: ingredients (whole grains, particularly, minimal anything else, and none of the really bad stuff); crunch, flavor, and ability to hold most of its texture in yogurt or soy milk.<br /><br />Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise was a pleasant surprise. It's really good!<br /><br />We don't insist on organic foods, but, for those who do, this is organic. We don't need a gluten-free diet, but for those who do, this cereal claims to be gluten-free.<br /><br />Here's a quick listing of ALL the ingredients listed on the box (and I'm removing the word "organic," just to save typing time--they're all prefaced by "organic" except for the ones with a hyphen before the name:<br /><br />whole grain corn meal<br />evaporated cane juice<br />brown rice flour<br />yellow corn flour<br />inulin<br />quinoa puffs<br />flax seeds<br />-natural vanilla flavor<br />buckwheat flour<br />quinoa<br />-sea salt<br />amaranth<br />molasses<br />-tocopherols (natural vitamin E)<br /><br />That's it. Pretty good, eh? 110 calories for 2/3 cup. 130 mg sodium, 70 mg potassium, 3g dietary fiber, 7g sugars<br /><br />The cereal has a lot of puffs and so is pretty lightweight--but still filling! It's basically puffs (of 2 sizes) and flakes, and they're all crunchy and tasty. They hold most of their crunchiness in a bowl of soy milk (though not overnight, which I found out the yucky way) and on top of yogurt (as long as you don't mix it in and leave it for a few hours, like when you take it to work for lunch).<br /><br />This was a really good change of pace from our usual favorite granola!

review/text: I enjoy eating healthy but I am by no means a "health-nut". Recently, I had a friend visit who is glueten free and I tried very hard to find a cereal that we could both eat as I find it wasteful to buy two completely different cereals. I found this one and thought I would give it a shot because it has a lot of the ingredients that I love. It was great! The taste was sweet with a hint of vanilla without being too powerful. I loved the crunch and it kept me full for awhile. I had my friend try it when she came to visit and she loved it! She even said that she wants to get some for herself when she gets home.<br /><br />As you might have noticed, I have rated the cereal with four stars. While everything I have stated is true, I really like it, there is a bit of an after-taste that isn't exactly enjoyable. Of course, I can get past this and my friend did as well. Still, for the amount that they are charging, I expected it to be flawless.

review/text: I do not have a gluten intolerance, so eating gluten-free cereal is not necessary for me personally. I do, however, attempt to eat as healthy as possible and that often means trying foods that are slightly outside of the box for me. I loved that this cereal contained such a great mix of healthy organic grains (quinoa, buckwheat, and amaranth), and that the nothing inside had been genetically modified. That was was enough to get me to try it.<br /><br />The taste is amazing! It's sweet without being too sweet, had a great crunch and stayed crunchy even after sitting in almond milk for a few minutes. The cereal pieces were so close to some of my favorite childhood cereals...in appearance, texture, and taste that I would have no problem feeding this to my son. It was like Kix, Rice Krispies, and Corn Flakes combined to make a healthier cereal. It's awesome!<br /><br />Calories are lower than most other cereals, yet I still felt full a couple of hours after having a normal-sized bowl and a banana. The sodium and sugar are both at good levels, and all of the minimal ingredients are easy to understand.<br /><br />Though no one in my family NEEDS to eat gluten free, we'll definitely continue to purchase this cereal. I was very impressed.

review/summary: (4.5 stars) Lifts my mood like the morning sunrise
review/text: Every Nature's Path product I've had has been great and their Organic Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise cereal is no exception. Featuring about four different shapes and textures into on cereal make for an interesting dining experience, and quite a tasty one at that. With a light vanilla flavor, it's sweeter than I was expecting, this is more for the consumer with a sweet tooth of which I am on occasion, but it isn't so sweet that you'd want to sprint to the nearest dentist after eating. This would be a great cereal for kids as a replacement for the unhealthier cereals marketed for children out there, the only downside is the box screams healthy and not "Kids, eat me!" All organic and natural, the ingredient list a dream; I love when I know what everything actually is. Nature's Path is a product of the USA and the box is made from 100% recycled paperboard, which makes this recycler happy.<br /><br />Here's a glance at the more important nutritional facts:<br /><br />Serving size: 2/3 cup (Seems a bit measly but fairly normal in comparison to most other cereals, which are usually 3/4 cup, but it's about the amount I generally have for breakfast anyway.)<br />Calories: 110 with just the cereal, only 10 from fat.<br />Total fat: 1 gram, no evil fats like saturated or trans, but no polyunsaturated or monounsaturated, which are good for you, either.<br />Cholesterol: Zilch<br />Sodium: 130 mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 25 grams<br />Dietary Fiber (included in Total Carbs): 3 grams (Could be better but better than a lot of cereals.)<br />Sugars (included in Total Carbs): 7 grams (Not bad, not bad at all. Ideally, one shouldn't have more than 6 g for breakfast, but what's one gram? ;P)<br />Protein: 2 grams<br />The cereal is also gluten-free and contains 11% (.15 grams) of omega 3 fatty acids per serving.<br />No real added vitamins to speak of.<br /><br />So, would I buy this again? Heck yeah. The blend of flavors, from the vanilla to the added sweetness to the flakes to the Kix-like spheres, it's one of my new faves. Topped with slices of banana, it lifts my mood like the morning sunrise. :D

review/text: Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise is quite a name to live up to. Unfortunately, it fails to live up to the high standards set by branding (and really, most any name). Given the name and a glance at the picture I was expecting some cereal that had granola type chunks mixed in with other stuff, but a heads up to others that might be confused - it does not contain anything resembling granola. It also tastes almost nothing like vanilla, mainly like sweet corn puffs.<br /><br />I am not taking any stars for my own confusion, as I eat lots of different types of cereals. (grapenuts are great (not sweet), but so are Reeses' pb puffs (very sweet). The main problem with this cereal seems to be the target audience, its trying to please the sugar lovers, and the health conscious people at the same time, and that's a hard target audience.<br /><br />The positives:<br />- lives up to the crunchy name<br />- Has decent quality ingredients (especially compared to the vast amounts of junk out there)<br />- Organic and Glutten free<br />- Big kids might like it, (but hard to see them dropping an even sweeter cereal for this one)<br /><br />The negatives:<br />- Lots of sugar (both cane juice - second right behind corn - and molasses) you can taste it<br />- Brings me back to the basic concept - a healthy cereal - but it's  basically organic corn puffs with cane juice and brown rice flour - which are at the low end of whole grains, and comes with just 3g of fiber. Basically the healthier ingredients are sprinkled in. A bit of quinoa, a bit of flax.<br /><br />So basically, if you get your kid to replace Corn Puffs with this, they'll be a bit better off.<br /><br />Yeah, this cereal suffers from an identity crisis. It's not healthy enough for health conscious, and its not marketed or inexpensive enough for a wider audience. Call them glorified corn puffs.

review/text: Nature's Path is certainly on the right path when it seems like half of my friends are going gluten-free. When you consider that certain people even though they may think it wise to ween off the wheat substance would find it very difficult because breakfast cereal is such a large part of their diet (guilty), it makes even more sense. Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise fits very nicely in the growing niche market. And it does so with style. This is a tasty cereal and since it's organic and has relatively low amounts of sugar, it's also healthy. The only problem is the weight. This is a light cereal (I guess gluten is really heavy) and thus makes the cost per ounce high. There are more important things than cost, however, and if health is one of those for you, this is a great addition to your cereal box collection.

review/text: The best thing I can say about a cereal that comes into my house is I didn't get too much of it because my girls ate it before I could. This cereal has whole grains and natural sweeteners. No one in our family is on a gluten free diet. But, for those who are, here is a natural cereal that doesn't cost an arm and a leg like many other gluten free products. And, it tastes delicious.

review/summary: Tasty, Nutritious, what could be better?
review/text: What do I like about this product? Truth in advertising....It's crunchy -  and stays crunchy in milk. It has a clear vanilla flavor - pure, not artificial tasting. It is healthy and compares well with other similar products in terms of sugar, fiber and general nutrition guidelines. It tastes great and I found myself eating it for breakfast and later on as a inter meal snack. Recommended!
