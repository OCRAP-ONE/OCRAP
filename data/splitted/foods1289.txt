review/summary: Bahlsen Waffeletten Cookies
review/text: I am very happy with Amazon service including the speedy shipment. I am also very happy the product Amazon is carrying. This product is only available in selected specialty stores in the area. And tend to be expensive. Sometime they only carry small selection in store. You have to wait long time for a special order. Amazon is making the product available with a wide selection of variaty and affortable. Thanks.

review/text: I LOVE these cookies.  Most cookies are too sweet for me -- not these.  However, since they follow the  European trend of using  natural ingredients, they are full of saturated fat from butter and cream.<br /><br />WHO CARES?<br /><br />They are the best cookies, for me, in the world, comparable only to<br />"Feullitees Doree," which can be bought on in France.

review/text: I bought these cookies for myself and as a gift for my dad for his birthday. Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly broken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad.

review/text: I really like these cookies.  They are made with pastry dough - lots of thin, flaky, crispy layers with a very light coating of honey (or something like honey).  The jelly center rounds the cookie out with a delicious bite of sweetness. It's a robust burst of flavor that makes you want to smile. I am rapidly getting addicted to these fine flavorful confections -- bet you can't eat just one!

review/text: I am an adventurous person who likes new things and when Amazon began selling the Bahlsen line I tried a number of their products and found them to be enjoyable and tasty, but the Hannover Wafer Cookies are, to my palate, rather bland and tasteless. The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'.

review/summary: Agreed, it's a great "go to" mixed spice...
review/text: Works for almost anything you can imagine in your recipes and doesn't have that "old" garlic odor like many garlic seasonings. Folks who enjoy cooking know what I mean by that. This smells more like you would find at a local farmer's market. IMO, all of Lizzie's spice combinations are worth trying. For my personal directions, just smell them when you open the top (and while you are cooking and creating something sniff a few) and you will know what to do with them. Nice fresh smells. The salsa verde and pico de gallo are particularly good for summer seasonings w/ a variety of foods. The hickory garlic is great for making your own barbeque sauce and using while grilling. The ones I have purchased have been very fresh and I am always finding new ways to use them. Lizzie's spices have been a wonderful find for me. I hope they stay as fresh as I have found them to be.

I add it to every pasta dish in my repertoire, meatloaf, guacamole, egg dishes - everything that can be improved with garlic becomes even better with this spice blend from Lizzie's Kitchen.  For soups, sauces, or bean dishes, I add it to the pan just as the meat has almost completed browning, and just prior to adding the liquid.  Amazon has the best price I've seen.  Right now, it comes in a pack of 4 which seems like a lot if you've never used it.  But I promise, once you've tried it you will keep coming back for more.

Stir gently to glaze the chicken tenders with Oh! So Garlic! goodness.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/summary: Great for Low Sodium Diets
review/text: My doctor said cut down on the salt so I went in search of seasonings without sodium.  I found Oh! So Garlic!  I have found that it does not work very well without some sort of heating/cooking with moisture and it also doesn't work real well if you heat it too high -- you will get a bitter taste.  Aside from that, it adds a delicious flavor to many foods.<br /><br />One of my favorite ways to use it is to sprinkle flattened chicken breasts (about 1 lb) with a generous coating, saute breasts in a skillet in olive oil for 5-7 minutes each side over medium heat; set aside chicken.  Combine 1/2 cup no-sodium chicken broth, 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar and 1 Tablespoon chopped garlic.  Stir into chicken bits in skillet and stir until liquid is reduced so a syrupy texture.  Pour over chicken breasts and serve.

Much cheaper than on Amazon, in any case I love it, I don't like over sugary or flavored drinks a soft hint of the flavor is sufficient for me and one squirt did the trick for me you can definitely taste the berry flavors. I have a 64oz jug of water that I drink everyday I put in 5 squirts in it this morning and it tastes great, that comes out to about 1 squirt for 12oz for me.

I also love the fact that I can take this along in my purse and enjoy it any where I go. The Berry Pomegranate is my favorite flavor out of the (I believe) 5 flavors available. It has a pleasingly fruity , berry Summery taste. Add a splash or two in a glass of Pellegrino or seltzer and you have made a real refreshing treat.

I didn't like it until I got the correct number of squeezes down pat. Once I figured out 3 squeezes per liter was "my sweet spot", I grew to love this. No aftertaste, no calories, no carbs. I think the Berry Pomegranate is the best flavor I've tried. I taste more pomegranate than berry and 3 squeezes makes the water very flavorful. MIO is a little expensive, but when I factored in how much I spent on Crystal Light, there wasn't much difference, and this is easier to use since it's more portable.

review/text: I picked this up at a local supermarket today after recently watching an advertisement on TV. Man, they got me good. Once you flip the top, it has one of those "no mess" type nozzles that squirts out only as long as pressure is applied to the bottle. Kinda neato. In terms of the actual taste and flavor, I used 8oz of water and initially, one half-second squirt of Mio Liquid Berry Pomegranate flavoring. I stirred it for a bit, and after much heart-wrenching anticipation, I was...not overly impressed. The initial resembling taste that I could recall would closely mimic that of Propel Water. It has a similar after taste after smacking the lips and tongue a bit.<br /><br />I found that if you really want it to be flavored water and not water with a hint of flavor, you have to use much longer squirts. I tried a one-second squirt, and my water tasted much better. I could really taste the berry and pomegranate flavoring, but not impressive enough to have a second glass. It advertises 24 servings per bottle, but I can't imagine what little flavor you will be tasting if you really tried to stretch it to 24 servings. In my case, maybe more like 10-12.<br /><br />My dealbreaker with this is that it provides no nutritional supplementation (i.e., antioxidants, vitamins, electrolytes, etc.), such as Propel, Vitamin Water, etc. So it really does just enhance the flavor of water. Seriously? I never thought water tasted that bad to begin with. But for mutants that have a hard time knocking back their non-flavored daily H20, this might do the trick. It's kind of cool to try out of novelty, and it definitely doesn't taste bad (they also have a plethora of yummy-delicious sounding flavors). But other than that, I can't imagine this being a household item. This is definitely not as cool as the bad boy putting is his pocket carrying with him around, as the commercial depicted. But one day if this does have nutritional supplementation, then watch out, because it's gonna be epic.

review/summary: Incredible!
review/text: This stuff is amazing. A lady had a little stand at my Albertson's so I was able to try before I bought and I was extremely suprised. You can use the amount you want and you dont need to stir it which is amazing. So far I have only tried the fruit punch and the Sweet Tea but I am heading back to the store later to get some of the others. Trust me this is no Crystal Light or any other water enhancer like you have ever tried before, this stuff doesnt have that yucky aftertaste or anything you will be very suprised. Also I recommend checking your grocery store price because it seems overly priced here.

review/text: This is some great stuff. I haven't try the other favors yet, but this favor is great. It doesn't take that much to add favor to the water, which is great, because it lasts longer, but it's the price that kills it for me (Amazon & in-stores). It's basically a overly price Kool-Aid. Hopefully they'll kick down the price, or this stuff might not last that long on the market, seeing how there is other options out there for less that enhance water, and make it taste just as this stuff does.

review/summary: A Way To Enhance San Diego Tap Water.
review/text: Mmmmmm, San Diego tap water. We get most of our drinking water from the lower reaches of the Colorado River, the waste drain for about 2/3 of the western US. Fortunately, the drainage basin is only sparsely populated. The water is safe. I've lived in San Diego for 49 years and there's never been a water problem of any magnitude. A lot of people won't drink it, including my wife. She'll only drink bottled water and the more expensive it is, the better it is. For a while she was drinking water imported from Figi and said it was the best water she's ever tasted. Well, you guessed it. It was also the most expensive bottled water she's ever consumed.<br /><br />Some people say that San Diego tap water smells bad. Fortunately, my sense of smell isn't that keen. A lot of people say it tastes bad. I guess my sense of taste isn't so keen either. I don't mind San Diego tap water at all. One thing I do note is that if you fill a glass and then let the glass evaporate dry, the interior of the glass is coated with a scummy white lining. Well, If you're drinking the water, you're also consuming whatever all that white stuff is. I assume it's just mineral matter which is especially common in arid areas, but who knows?<br /><br />In any case, I was recently browsing our nearby grocery store and found an interesting product. It's called MiO Liquid Water Enhancer and comes in a variety of different flavors. You put a drop, or any amount you might like, into a glass and then fill the glass with water, in my case tap water. There's no need to mix or anything. Now you have slightly flavored or enhanced tap water. The flavor I chose for trying was Berry Pomegranate. It says there's 24 servings in the little bottle, but the number would depend on how liberal you are with the little squirt you put in. I tried it a few times and prefer only a very slight enhancement, so my bottle will probably last a lot longer. I'm definitely not looking for something that tastes like soda pop. Well, the slightly enhanced San Diego tap water is kinda nice. It tastes good. The only odor I can detect is the slight fragrance of the additive. Hmmmm. This  stuff could be a big seller in areas like San Diego!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: For me, there is a very unpleasant aftertaste
review/text: I don't like to fly in the face of so many positive reviews; clearly there are many people who like this product.<br /><br />While I get absolutely zero aftertaste from so many artificially sweetened products (Dr Pepper 10 and Coke Zero being my favorites), MiO leaves an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweeteners of many years ago.<br /><br />The fruit flavors are very good, but the aftertaste ruins it.  Your mileage may vary...<br /><br />I give this two stars instead of one because I really appreciate the idea of a liquid flavor-to-taste product.

review/text: I use this to ensure that water in other cities is not distasteful. It has a great fruity flavor and tastes very sweet versus the intensity of the fruit flavor, which I like. Excellent container ... flip the top, squirt the desired amount and click the top securely closed, all with one hand. Not only is this my constant travel companion but I use it at home too when I want a quick refreshing drink.

review/summary: Berry Pomegranate Addict
review/text: I am addicted to this stuff.  It is my absolute favorite flavor in the Mio line.  And I don't care if it doesn't "enhance" my water with vitamins...I don't need supplements.  I enjoy being able to adjust the amount I use; as one other reviewer stated sometimes I just want a hint and other times I want full flavor.  The added convenience of being able to purchase a four pack is great since my supermarket can never keep this in stock.<br /><br />To those worried about the propylene glycol and the coloring, you'll probably not want to drink plain water once you find out it contains and you certainly won't want to breathe the air considering what's in it too. Whatever finally kills me off, I'll most likely go with a glass of Mio Berry Pomegranate in my hand.

review/summary: Great Alternative
review/text: Hey I need flavored water! Plain water just doesn't do it for me. And almost all of us just don't hydrate enough. So what's a 21st century human to do? I drink Sobe Water, Vitamin Water, etc. That helps. But I do feel guilty tossing away all that plastic after a drink. And the cost is about $1.50 per.<br /><br />MiO is a great alternative. Extremely easy to use. The berry pomegranate taste rather good. Hey it's not like it's real or anything. But if a squirt helps you drink a glass of water where otherwise you wouldn't well that's a good trick. And you can always wean yourself from a big squirt down to a little squirt anytime you want. And for comparison, the cost is about 30 cents per 16oz. Not to mention the cosmic benefit of less plastic to thrown away and less gas used to truck those filled  bottles to market.<br /><br />Truly a genius product!

review/text: Don't bother buying this here, it is WAY overpriced.  Stop by Wal-Mart and pay a bit over half what these people are selling the stuff for.<br /><br />Anyway, we have now tried all the flavors.  Like any other flavor, some we like better than others as it is a matter of personal preference... but all of them were good.  We really like all but the Fruit Punch and will cycle through all the other remaining flavors again and again.<br /><br />Kraft Foods are not claiming they have invented a new major food group here, it is water flavoring.  They came through with that just fine.  Unscrew the cap, squirt into the bottle, replace the cap and shake.  Can't get any easier than that.  Using tap water is fine too.

I love the taste and love that you can just squirt to perfectly fulfill whatever your flavor need is at the time. I will totally be purchasing these again in the future.

My order was for $25.31 here on Amazon, no tax, no ship, sold by Family Fun Shoppes LTD.  That works out to $6.33 per bottle.<br /><br />Saw nothing but 5/4 stars, naturally assumed it was a good buy, wished I had read all the comments first, I'm giving it only 1 star so that the next buyer know what they're getting. Again product itself is excellent, the seller, not so much.

review/summary: Forget it. Complete gimmick. Buy Crystal Light instead.
review/text: Sometimes, I am a sucker for the new stuff, and this is one fine example.  In my quest to drink more water, I sought out flavorings.  My perception of this product is quite different from the reality I experienced after buying it.<br /><br />Being a marketing professional myself, I think I have this gimmick figured out perfectly.  If only I had not fallen for it, I would feel a lot better.  So, here is how the gimmick goes:<br /><br />1. Rather than selling consumers perfectly portioned pouches of flavored powder, such as those sold under the Crystal Light brand and other brands, sell it to them in liquid form and claim that is has 24 servings inside.  This makes it seem like a good value per serving, but a "serving" is a meaningless measure, as consumers will squirt and squirt and squirt some more to get enough flavoring.  The bottle doesn't say how many squirts is 1 serving.  Rest assured, consumers will use far more than 1 serving at a time, and they will never know how many servings they really get from the bottle.<br /><br />2. Since a squirt bottle can come in only one flavor, consumers will have to buy lots of bottles, rather than just a nice variety pack of the single-serve Crystal Light or similar packets.  This "pantry loading", as they call it, not only leads to higher sales up front, but it also locks in the consumer, who feels wedded to his investment.<br /><br />3. Tell the consumer on the package that the contents should be used within 30 days of opening the bottle.  This will make consumers either (a) throw it out for fear that it has gone bad or (b) use it up faster to prevent if from going bad.  Either way, this means more sales from new sales.<br /><br />Interestingly, this product is made by the same company that sells Crystal Light--Kraft Foods.  This tells me they are not satisfied with certain aspects of Crystal Light, such as the fact that others make generic versions and sell them more cheaply.  Hence, they have created a product that competes with Crystal Light, in hopes that at least some of them will switch, leading to enhanced profitability and less competition from those pesky alternatives in powder form.

review/summary: A delicious treat
review/text: Well, since some other user decided they'd paste their review on to each flavor allow me to give my short but sweet review:<br /><br />MiO is delicious. I like that I can just put in the tiniest of splashes in my drink and just have a hint of flavor... or splash a lot in and get a real flavorful experience. It's a quick and easy thing to use. It's also fun to watch it splash into the water. I've also found it's good to flavor different types of alcohol.<br /><br />In regards to the criticism by other reviewers for it containing propylene glycol - don't be in a panic like them. propylene glycol is harmless unless ingest massive quantities of it. Using a canard like "it's considered harmful to pets so humans shouldn't ingest it!" is just alarmist behavior. Chocolate is harmful to dogs. Better not eat that then!<br /><br />Lastly, in regards to it having so many "food colorings" - well, if you don't like anything that flavors your water to have anything artificial in it, squeeze a lemon into it. Put a dash of sugar. Or just drink the water plain. You know what you're getting into when you buy this stuff.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is my new favorite drink flavoring. I will be buying from them again and again.

review/text: I got my bottle of Mio from a free sampling campaign run on Facebook, I was skeptical at first because I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners. But this is the first product that has artificial sweeteners in it that I like! Like other users, I do find that you have to use a lot to get a desirable taste, but when you do it's like a glass of Kool Aide. I am upset to see that it's essentially $6 a bottle for this stuff, I was hoping it wouldn't be that expensive. I think this is a nice thing to have around, but certainly not a necessity. My kids love it too, but are also happy with lemon water which is far cheaper, doesn't have artificial anything, and does actually provide some vitamins.

review/summary: Love this drink
review/text: I discovered this on Walgreens close-out shelf and bought it to try. During the winter I brew white and green tea but, iced during the summer, it loses most of its flavor as it waters down. This is the perfect antidote, and I even came back here to order the individual sticks so that, if I let my drink get too watery, I can give it a quick boost. I know I'm drinking chemicals, but I hope the antioxidants compensate and work toward my health.

review/summary: This stuff is Good!
review/text: Very good and super easy tea.  Comes with 6 little containers in the tube, it takes 2 to make a gallon, so 3 gallons per tube.  Tastes great, and super fast to make.  This is better than the powdered diet green tea IMO, which is ok, but doesn't taste as good the stuff you can buy in the store.

review/text: I often have a hard time finding Arizona Tea in different flavors or during the winter months. I drink it year round and do not like to drink out of a can. So I always buy the gallon container. I bought this mix thinking to use it when I can't find the jug.<br /><br />However after mixing it with filtered water I will not bother to buy the jug again. I can store this in a relatively small space, mix up 1/2 gallon at a time as I desire and it tastes just as good as the product that comes in the jug. Love it and will buy it frequently!

review/text: My family was very disappointed with this drink. We were surprised because we have always enjoyed Arizona Iced Tea. But as a mix with the Pomegranate and Green Tea, this drink tasted like a weak solution of grape lollipops. I think that you should mix the drink with less water than the container calls for and the taste will be more like  Pomegranate.

review/text: This drink mix doesn't taste like tea. You might like it as a beverage, but the bitter pom-a-granite flavor is not for everyone. Putting more Splenda in it helps a little.

For a sugar-free mix that really tastes like a delicious, refreshing tea, try Arizona Sugar Free Green Tea mix, instead.

review/text: I am a big fan of both cashews and Dark chocolate. This product did not taste like either. I am so disappointed. You can tell that they are cashews by sight. But they taste nothing like them at all. The Chocolate? What chocolate? The product looks like cashews held together with the slightest amount of what may be chocolate but there is so little it could be cocoa powder cornstarch and water. then when the mix dries it is cut into these tiny squares. Perhaps 5 pieces per pack. Your money is all going into the fancy packaging. With such little product why should you need a resealable pouch with a humidity packet inside. Ridiculous!!

review/text: These were just OK.  If considering the low price, then above average.  The container for measuring is really nice and made of quality durable plastic.  My biggest complaint about these nuts is that they didn't taste very fresh (even though the date stamp indicates they are).  But then again, other mass-produced nuts I have tried have same issue, like Emerald Brand, Diamond Brand, etc.  But the taste wasn't bad.  It is hard to find roasted unsalted nuts, and the container is really handy.  So I think I would still buy again even though they weren't great.

I like that they are individually packed so they do stay fresh but I am VERY disappointed with the quality of the almonds.  I find a lot of small, hard almonds that seem like they should have been discards.  The almonds I bought from the grocery store were all large and plump.  Many of these blue diamond almonds are small, shriveled and tough.  When I say many, I mean at least 25%.  I won't buy this brand again.  Almonds aren't cheap and if Im spending a lot of money on them Im want better quality.

review/text: I love Indian food. I own two Indian food cookbooks, but find the list of spices so daunting that I've never tried any of their recipes. I heard from a coworker that prepared Indian curry pastes were available at specialty stores, so I looked for them here at Amazon and was delighted to find Patak's curry pastes. The spice level is nice, for those of us who like our food hot and spicy, and you can always add more paste if you want more kick.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients: Vegetable oil, cilantro, salt, tamarind, water, cumin, turmeric, chile pepper, ground ginger, garlic powder, maize flour, spices, acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid.<br /><br />And here is a basic recipe from the label:<br /><br />Shrimp Vindaloo, serves 2<br /><br />1 medium onion, diced<br />2 tbsp vegetable oil<br />8 oz. fresh shrimp, peeled (or any other meat)<br />3/4 cup water<br />4 tbsp Patak's hot vindaloo curry paste<br />1/2 cup diced canned tomatoes<br />hot, cooked rice<br /><br />Saute onion in oil. Add shrimp and saute until pink. Stir in curry paste and cook about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and water. Simmer, uncovered until the shrimp is cooked, about 5 minutes. Serve over hot, cooked rice.<br /><br />I tried it with beef (which you'd never be able to order at an Indian restaurant) and simmered for 25 minutes, and it turned out pretty well. Not exactly restaurant quality, but very good for a prepared paste. I now keep Patak's paste and some tomatoes on hand, in case I want to whip up a quick, spicy dish using leftover roast chicken or beef. I look forward to trying the other Patak's pastes.

review/text: When I began cooking for myself about 6 years ago, I tried five or six different recipes for chicken vindaloo, from Madhur Jaffrey's classic recipe to actor Anthony Hopkins' "healthful" one (which I found on some entertainment Web site).<br /><br />Most were good, with Jaffrey's being the best of the bunch, Hopkins' the worst (Hannibal's take on vindaloo was surprisingly bland). None of the recipes were nearly as good, however, as the spiced-just-right vindaloo I used to order at least once a week from Baluchi's when I lived in New York City.<br /><br />During my recipe experimentation, I visited a local Asian grocery store and asked the clerk for some advice. He recommended trying Patak's paste. I was dubious, but I did. It was absolutely great. And the bonus: The Patak's recipe is much easier to fix than the various recipes I had been collecting.<br /><br />I've cooked with this paste so often now, I've learned to make a few alterations to the recipe. I basically follow the directions on the jar (substituting chicken for shrimp), but add a 1/4 cup of yogurt and about a tablespoon of fresh minced cilantro at the end of the cooking process. If I have some lemon juice around, I put in a couple of squirts just before serving. (I usually cook the dish with two to two-and-a-half pounds of chicken and freeze the leftovers. It reheats well.)<br /><br />If you're using chicken breasts rather than dark meat, make sure not to overcook and dry out the chicken. That's about the only thing you'll need to guard against. (A friend told me to marinate the chicken bits in yogurt and then cook them under a broiler, separate from the sauce but adding them to the sauce once they're cooked through. He says this locks in the moistness and adds a little flavor to the meat via the slight charring/carmelization that results. I haven't tried it, but it sounds good.)<br /><br />By the way, I'm not sure how healthy this paste is; don't overuse the paste or the dish can get a bit greasy, for example. (There must be a fair amount of oil in the paste.) Just use the amount recommended on the jar and you should be fine.<br /><br />Patak's doesn't beat Baluchi's chicken vindaloo, but for a home cook looking to make fast and tasty vindaloos, this paste can't be beat.<br /><br />Now if I could just learn to make a quick-and-easy naan, I'd really be in business...

review/summary: my alltime favorite addition to rice
review/text: Vindaloo Curry paste is so great! The flavor is amazing, I add coconut milk to mine when I make it because my fiance can't handle the heat like I can. It's the perfect sauce to cook your meat in, and just put a scoop of the meat/sauce over rice, I usually have corn on the side. And of course a tall glass of milk, as it has a slight zing to it, depending on your heat-tollerance of course. :)

review/summary: Very Good - and very spicy!
review/text: While I am not Indian, I do cook Indian food from scratch quite often.  I have taken lessons on and off for the past three years, and have gotten tips, recipes, and compliments from my Indian co-workers.  This stuff is good - all the Patek sauces I've tried are - but be aware that this stuff is bloody hot (as Vindaloo should be)!  Have some Cucumber Raita ready.

review/summary: I am so addicted to this stuff!
review/text: Pataks makes superior curry paste with excellent flavor and not too much heat. The paste is simple to use and really gives that flavor that you are craving. I particularly enjoy putting a spoonful into the water when I make rice - no need for anything else :)<br /><br />The only con is that the jar seems to get empty too quickly ;)<br /><br />- Hope that helps.

review/summary: An easy way to have delicious indian food at home
review/text: I love Indian food and when I discovered Patak's cooking sauces it al-lowed me have delicious Indian food at home with very little effort.  I am am able to get 3 or 4 dinners out of one jar container.<br /><br />I use this Vindaloo paste as a base and add the following ingredients: coconut milk, fresh cilantro, and garlic.<br />I typically make either chicken or lamb cut up in small pieces.  I also often add vegetable into the same pan, potatoes and onions work very well.  Sometimes I also like adding broccoli, cauliflower or chickpeas for variety.<br /><br />The best price for this sauce I found in a local Indian store.  They have a very large variety of Patak's sauces: different flavors and different hotness. I usually buy a large variety and store unopened jars in the basement. They keeps very well for a long time.<br /><br />I have tried a variety of Indian cooking sauces and Patak's is my favorite.<br /><br />Ali Julia review
