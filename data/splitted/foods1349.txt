review/summary: Wonderful for malnourished kittens
review/text: I've been really impressed with this grain-free cat food.  It is full<br />of nutrients, and my two rescue kittens love it.  I mix it with about a<br />Tablespoon of GNC Pets Ultra Mega Premium Milk Replacer for Kittens<br />which is readily available either at Petsmart or from gnc.com.  My<br />kittens went from being rail-thin to nice and fat on this stuff.  Highly<br />recommended!

review/summary: My cat's favorite flavor
review/text: My cat absolutely loves this flavor. Normally, I have to coax her to finish her food, but when I give her a serving of Chicken & Herring, the bowl is clean in like five minutes. I do not understand why some of the other reviewers blamed the company for selling them bad cans--their cats probably just prefer another flavor. I say experiment to see what your cat will eat, and stay away from cat food with grains in it!

Canned food was recommended for her by our veterinarian (who only sees cats). . . who said it's closer to what they would "naturally" eat.

review/summary: My cats now love it!
review/text: I have two cats, one under 1 year old and the other is 4 years old. After researching about proper cat diets, I realized that they needed a good grain-free meaty canned food. Wellness fit the bill. The younger cat ate up the chicken flavor instantly and loved it! The older cat however, refused to eat it at first. She was used to eating dry kibbles and occasionally canned fancy feast. She kept refusing to eat the Wellness and I caved in and let her finish the bag of kibbles. Only when we didn't have any other food than the canned wellness did she approach it. So once she was good and hungry, and the younger cat was in another room, she crept out and started eating it!! Now she loves it and eats the chicken flavor with no problem. I haven't tried out the other flavors, but since I had such a hard time getting her to come around to eating it in the first place, I've been feeding them both the chicken flavor exclusively. If your cat won't eat Wellness, be patient and get rid of their previous food so when they get hungry they only have one choice. Mixing the old food with the new one wasn't as successful as just waiting it out. Their coats are super shiny and they are both at a healthy weight on a wellness diet.

review/text: I would truly recommend this brand to anyone with a cat. My cat had a ton of problems - from vomitting to diarrhea and really smelly poop. Not only did this solve all those issues, but he now has the most silkiest, softest, shiniest fur. The quantity of food intake has also decreased. No more begging for food every 5 minutes. Another bonus - my cat now has a lean and toned body that I'm envious of.<br />This product will save you a lot of trips to the vet!!!

review/summary: Good, healthy food
review/text: Did some googling on kitten nutrition and found that the food I was feeding my kitten did not have very high water content and that she was supposed to be eating a meat based food (grain is no good for cats).  This food seemed to match well with what google told me, and I've been feeding her this wet food for 2 months now.  She seems to like the food and she looks great.  She seemed pretty healthy before as well, but there was a noticeable difference after I switched her food.  Her coat is shinier and softer, she's more energetic, and has been maintaining a good weight.  I wish it wasn't so expensive, but I think its worth the price and I will keep buying it.

review/summary: Better than most canned food but still BAD
review/text: I have a cat who had serious intestinal issues. I needed a canned food that was grain free and also I need a protein that was not chicken - I had to start my cat on a novel protein. I bought this on the recommendation of a veterinarian (L. Pierson) on her web site, for so called "acceptable" canned food, because it is grain free. However if you read the ingredients list, it contains other ingredients that the same veterinarian says are allergenic to cats (e.g. carageenan). Also, even though its name claims it is "Turkey", (the turkey was supposed to be the novel protein for me) the ingredients list lists chicken and chicken parts as its 2nd, 3rd and 4th ingredients. It also has the same type of thickeners, fillers, and "flavoring" that all the other run of the mill canned pet food has.<br /><br />I originally gave this a 3 star rating (because it doesn't contain grains), but as I typed my review I was reminded of the deception and it made me change it to a 2 star.

review/summary: Positive for Wellness
review/text: My background is 50 years of dog/cat owner and college degree in chemistry so I'm not completely ignorant about pet nutrition. After a few days of Google research and reading pet food negatives and positives, I decided on a mix of Wellness both wet and the dry exclusively for my two rescue/shelter kitties based on reviews and availability. Price was not a deciding factor. After 1-1/2 years, they still gobble it down and I'm pleased to report both kitties mental and physical health to be outstanding with shiney, smooth coats, regular bowel movements, and healthy, energetic activity. I contribute this good fortune mostly to their diet of Wellness and a loving home environment although my billfold wouldn't mind if it were a bit cheaper. In my experience, Wellness has been outstanding.

Yesterday was the first time we tried the Salmon and Trout flavor, and absolutely none of them would touch it. They left it in their dishes all day and went hungry.<br /><br />I'll still give it 3 stars, because overall Wellness is better than anything else out there. Just be sure to test out the different flavors on your cats before committing to any bulk orders.

This Wellness Canned food is very fresh and (according to the experts) has all the healthy nutrition cats need. I've tried a few different brands and this one gives my cats the best soft, full coat and even makes their poop smell less (super bonus!). It's pricier, but give it a shot.

review/summary: GREAT WAY TO TAKE A REALLY HEALTHY DRINK ON THE ROAD
review/text: If you are looking for taste, nutrition, and low carbs/calories, this beverage is for you. Add to that low sodium in this particular variation and you have a drink we should all be drinking. I was always a bit reluctant to indulge in this yummy veg-fest because of the huge amount of added sodium, but now the low-sodium product has become much more available and costs only 30% more than the original high-sodium version. Typically, this low-sodium, mixed 100% vegetable juice is the type of drink that sells for $2-4 at a juice bar per 8-ounce serving or about $8-$10 per quart from a health food store in bottles. WHY?<br /><br />There are more than 8 reasons WHY V8 is so special -- Tomatoes, Beets, Celery, Carrots, Lettuce, Parsley, Watercress and Spinach are the first eight. Low carbs/calories and no added sugar are the 9th and 10th reasons. Low sodium and the resulting favorable potassium/sodium ratio give this particular version an 11th reason to become a truly 5-star product. Also, the 17 mg. of naturally-occurring lycopene in an 8-ounce serving is more than the average amount that you would find in single-nutrient lycopene supplements which cost an average of 16 cents per pill and which are less bio-available than the naturally-occurring lycopene in the V8 juice. With all the naturally occurring vitamins, minerals, and anti-oxidants in "V8 100% Vegetable Juice", this is a really healthy dietetic treat as an in-between snack.<br /><br />If you are not allergic to the ingredients [e.g., tomato allergy], this is the most practical and convenient way to add a very healthy serving of mixed vegetables to your diet. This variety in a small can is a little pricey, but it is very convenient and your body will thank you.<br /><br />TASTING THE CAN????<br /><br />Some people mentioned that they tasted the can. I always pour the contents out of the can when I first open it, unless I am going to finish it in one gulp. The aluminium in the container does leach into the acidic vegetable drink due to oxidation once it is opened, so remove it or drink it ASAP. The bottles all have an expiration date stamped on them, but since I do not have the cans on hand I can't say for sure whether they do as well.

review/summary: Low sodium V8 - add it to your routine
review/text: The obesity epidemic is partly fueled (pun intended) by sugar saturated drinks of all descriptions - from coke to orange juice.  Want to get thin and/or stay thin?  Get these out of your diet.<br /><br />So what do you drink?  There's always water, but that's boring.  Artifical sweeteners are a good choice, though many worry about the "chemicals" that cause the sweetness.<br /><br />So...a good alternative is V8 juice. But not the regular concoction,w hich has way too much salt. Hence the five stars for the low-sodium variety.  I also appreciate these tiny cans, which I use on days when I'm not exercising vigorously.<br /><br />But I wouldn't buy them from Amazon at these prices!

review/summary: as good as any I have had, and convenient packageing
review/text: I'm writing this brief review a no one else has yet added one.  I ordered this when Amazon was out of Frontier, a brand I have become familiar with only through Amazon.  Because I now have experience with that brand and have been uniformly happy with their spices, I will order it without hesitation.<br /><br />I needed a quantity of turmeric to make (lime) pickle and Amazon was sold out of the other brand at the time.  They offer quite a variety of brands and packaging for turmeric.  While I was using a lot on this occasion (more than I routinely use), I was not going to be using 1,2 or 5 lbs all at once, and so did not really want a 5 lb jar, or a dozen bags.  I chose this in large part because it was packed in containers which could be easily stored and which would keep the spice fresh and dry until I was ready to use it (where I live is very humid, and so that is always a concern).  Having no experience with this particular brand, and seeing no reviews, I was a little concerned about quality (which really matters more than packaging).  I am happy to say that I found the quality to be as good as any I have had (to include various brands I have bought in 2 oz jars at the supermarket, as well as what I have bought from my local health food store (in bulk bins).  The Sadaf turmeric powder I received was fresh, good color and taste, as good as any I have had. I would order it again and will be looking at the other spices they offer.

review/text: You cannot beat this product. Same for all the Tinkyaka rice pastas. You cannot tell the difference between these gluten free items and durum wheat pastas for texture, flavor (as a full blown celiac I really appreciate products that resemble, are as good as, what I used to eat before I was diagnosed). You can reheat without the decomposition that happens with quinoa pastas. Leftovers freeze well and reheat well in either oven or microwave. Recommend the brown rice Tinkyada products where available because the protein and fiber count is a just little higher. Amazon is less expensive than any grocery store and they deliver to your door free of charge!

review/summary: Better than any other I've found
review/text: This is great pasta.  It's as close to normal pasta as anything I've found.  Other GF pastas that are corn and/or quinoa based have an odd taste and a grainy texture.  Other rice pastas are somewhat delicate and you have to be extremely careful with the cook time or the pasta will fall apart completely.  This pasta is quite sturdy (for lack of a better word) in that you don't have to watch the cook time as closely.  I have cooked the shells (and other shapes like penne and fusilli) more than ten times, and I have never had this brand fall apart and turn to mush -  even when mixing in melted cheese to make a homemade mac & cheese.  The texture is similar enough to regular wheat pasta that you can hardly tell a difference.  The flavor is also very similar to that of normal pasta.  I have only used the "energy-efficient" cooking method on the front of the package (you bring the water to a boil, add pasta and boil for a minute then remove from heat and cover for 8-10 minutes), so I cannot say whether the pasta holds up as well when it is cooked using the standard boiling method.

review/summary: I wouldn't have known it was GF
review/text: I cooked up some of these for myself last night while the rest of my family had regular semolina linguine. I was afraid I was going to feel pretty deprived, but when I spooned some alfredo sauce on my little Tinkyada GF pasta shells and took a bite--they were GOOD! I found myself wishing I had cooked a few more for seconds.<br /><br />The texture and flavor are great. The only flaw I could see, a very minor one, is that if I had cooked these the full 14-16 minutes suggested they probably would have been quite mushy. I didn't time it exactly, but I think I probably cooked mine about half that time.<br /><br />I will be buying more Tinkyada products.

review/summary: Highly Recommended Sauce
review/text: Chiavetta's Barbeque Marinade is probably the best vinegar based marinade/basting sauce I've ever used. I had remembered having chicken cooked with this sauce as a kid, but now that I found it online, I'm always going to stay well stocked. Make sure to follow the instructions, and by that I mean absolutely seal the meat in a container for 15 minutes after a final baste after bringing the meat off the grill. Also, use some common sense - don't have pools of the sauce sitting on the meat when you serve it; the vinegar may overpower the meat then. As long as you do those two things, you will not be disappointed. My wife, who is NOT a fan of chicken by any stretch but will eat it, was picking the meat off bone-in chicken breasts marinated and cooked with Chiavetta's marinade. She said it was the best chicken she'd ever had and only wanted to know when I was going to make it again.<br /><br />I highly recommend this sauce to anyone who likes to grill, especially bone-in chicken. I did try this marinade on boneless/skinless chicken breasts and was less impressed, but it was still very tasty. I haven't tried this sauce on other meats but it is totally worth it even if you are only going to use it for bone-in chicken pieces.

review/text: Chiavetta's is the absolute best "brine" that you can buy.  The flavors after marinating overnight are fantastic.  However, you have to use a grill to cook the chicken in order to max out the flavor.  Make sure to shake the bottle well.<br /><br />This is only a 64oz bottle (not a gallon).  In addition, you can go to Chiavetta's and get a 6 pack of 32oz bottles for just a little more money.  I made the mistake of buying this one thinking it was a gallon (my fault for not using my head).  There are other Amazon listings that are also cheaper.

review/summary: Might as well buy the gallon, you'll wish you had.
review/text: Hands down, this is the world's best all purpose marinade. And a gallon will go a long<br />long way, but you'll find so many uses for this marinade you'll want to make sure you<br />have plenty on hand.<br /><br />Chiavetta's is legendary in the Buffalo area. Their entire line of sauces and salad dressings<br />are top notch, but this apple cider based marinade is pure magic.<br /><br />This stuff has transformative power. I've even used it on steak and the results were amazing,<br />but its best on chicken and pork (chops, ribs, and particularly tenderloin). Use it sparingly<br />and don't overmarinate, you'll be very happy with the results. A bottle of this stuff should<br />last you a long time, or maybe not cause its addictive.<br /><br />This is how Chiavetta's Catering makes chicken: You shake the bottle to mix its combination of<br />vinegar, salt, secret spices, and garlic then marinate uncooked chicken in it for at least 30<br />minutes before grilling the chicken over charcoal. During the grilling, you continue to baste<br />the chicken with the marinade, then remove the chicken, place it in a pan, baste it again, cover<br />it and let the sauce steam into the meat for 10 or 15 minutes.<br /><br />Simple enough, right? The biggest tribute to this stuff are the number of copycat recipes on<br />the web. Glad to see the company has expanded their distribution, oddly not down to Florida<br />yet cause there's a lot of New Yorkers down here. Please note, this is a marinade, not a sauce<br />so no pouring this on the finished product, its too strong. Enjoy!

review/summary: GREAT PRODUCT BUT SHIPING FROM HELL
review/text: Kern's Pear Nectar is delicious!  The nectar is thicker than most and the taste is fantastic<br />It's like a fully ripe pear, picked at the perfect time.  The price of $32 for 24 cans was exorbitant once I found out that Ralph's Mkt stocks this product for 59 cents per can.............$14.16 vs $32.<br /><br />What irritated me more than the price was the manner in which the product shipped.  The cans were placed individually into the box and surrounded with shavings of popcorn styrofoam that stuck to the surface of each can.  Most of the cans were dented and two had opened during shipping and made the cans sticky.  There was no case or shrink-wrap around the product.  I would seriously recommend that you do not use this vendor any more.<br /><br />Kathy English

review/summary: Excellent flavor, no after taste, smooth
review/text: I cannot abide plain coffee so I've been sampling all the flavored coffees for our new Keurig machine. Some have just been too strong for me, too bitter, or too chemically tasting. (Husband calls me Coffee goldilocks) So I was delighted to realize the Folgers Caramel Drizzle was just right. Sort of a smooth, silky feel in the mouth, mild to medium roast and not too strong at all. The caramel flavor is light and not overwhelming, but it smells GREAT while brewing. It's not quite sweet enough for me (that being said, it IS lightly sweet on it's own). I added a teaspoon of sugar to a 7 ounce cup and literally a splash of milk and it was perfect. Fortunately this is also available regularly at our local grocery store as well as Amazon. And for less than the third party sellers are offering it.

review/summary: Just a saltine, nothing special
review/text: I have to disagree with the rave reviews on this cracker. It looks like any saltine, with the minor exception of an orange/red tint, constituting the "tomato" content. One might find attractive or novel in comparison to a white saltine. If held close to the nose, a very slight herb scent, the "basil" content, can be detected. But it's a scent, not a taste, and that smell is very faint and doesn't seem to last once exposed to air.<br />The taste of tomato/basil in virtually absent.<br /><br />I wanted to like these. I doubt anyone, if blindfolded, could taste the difference between this and any average saltine. I do not think my taste buds are insensitive to subtle flavors. These are just colored saltines, that's it. They are OK, but do not expect flavor as indicated by "tomato basil". Nutrition-wise, these are not a "health food" by any stretch of the imagination! These have little character, but hey, if you like saltines...<br /><br />Also,there wasn't enough shock absorbent in the packaging to prevent 85% of the crackers from being broken into an average of 3 or 4 small pieces. To survive UPS, maybe they should use a bunch of large bubble wrap or figure out something. My guess is one sharp, flat drop would cause the result I received. The company should ship these to themselves in tests until they can get the packaging right.<br /><br />I recommend  Doctor Kracker Flatbread for texture and quality. I like the "Organic and Artisan-Baked Klassic 3 Seed" variety. They were very tasty, didn't arive all broken up, and have a much better protein to calorie ratio.

review/summary: I love Lea & Perrins Traditional Steak Sauce
review/text: Lea & Perrins Traditional Steak Sauce is a wonderful sauce who's value I would put at about the same value per-ounce as A1 Sauce premium flavors. I would even pay a slight premium more if you love it as much as I do but not a huge premium.<br /><br />For burgers this is hands down my absolute favorite topping. A properly seasoned beef-patty w/ lettuce, Swiss cheese and Lea&Perrins Traditional Steak Sauce make a perfect burger. This sauce is has great tangy, well-seasoned, slightly spicy-sweet flavor that is very unique. I recommend every one try it. Right now, a few local restaurants around me have it on their tables. If you see it in your area, you really should try it on anything beef. Also, you can substitute this for any A1 Sauce flavor to try it out.<br /><br />In my opinion, Lea&Perrins has a done a very poor job of marketing this wonderful product in the U.S., and are really short changing themselves and their Customers. Way too often, I ask for this sauce in a Restaurant or Grocer and they'll say they have it. But, they are always thinking of the L&P Worcestershire Sauce and are always confused there could be anything else. L&P really could have named the product better too to make it very distinct from their truly "traditional sauce" which is, of course, "Lea&Perrins Original Worcestershire Sauce". Their Worcestershire is great in it's own right, but these two sauces have very different flavor profiles. This is the second time this product has become commonly available in the U.S. and I am really hoping they do a better job of getting the word out this time.<br /><br />I love this sauce and I'm sure you'll at least like it a lot. Try it and let us know what you think. Thanks.

review/summary: Healthy, flavourful, smooth teas
review/text: Having tried tried many brands and varieties of Yerba Mate over the last 3 years, I have developed a strong liking for the Guayaki brand after 2 years of enjoyment of their product. They are a quality brand producing fine Mate.<br /><br />I don't find the Guayaki Mate quite as strong as other brands, having less of that Mate kick, however I do find the smooth, rich flavours very satisfying. I have several different ones in my kitchen right now - they're good for 2 to 3 cups a day. Their Mate drinks are similar to the Aviva brand in the range of flavours, however Guayaki is clearly a superior brand. Between Taragui and Guayaki brand Mate, I am hooked on this drink for its uplifting, positive effect on my health and well-being.<br /><br />I am a native of South Africa, the home of Rooibos (Red Bush) tea - and while I enjoy it, this Mate has a more profound effect. And tastes a darn sight better than Green Tea.<br /><br />The appeal of this and the other flavours will depend on your own taste preferences, however I enjoy them all and recommend the product whole-heartedly. It's got a permanent place in my kitchen, my work bag and car, with me wherever I happen to be.

review/text: A delicious and effective mild brain stimulant, Yerba Mate is a South American tradition spreading through the US market as an alternative to the caffeine bomb drinks that flood the market under the "energy drink" category.  what I affectionally call the "twitchy seizure" category - Red Bull, Monster, etc.)<br /><br />Note: there is a substantial amount of information on the internet (take that for what it's worth) that suggests that prolonged excessive use of Yerba Mate can lead to some significant health risks.  Not sure if there's any truth to that or not...probably best to enjoy in moderation anyway...which is what I would recommend for coffee and all the caffeine bomb drinks too.  Let your daily morning pickup be a nice hot cup of camellia sinensis - plain black tea, enjoyed around the world by people that live healthier longer lives than us Yanks.

It has room for your poof ball, shampoo, conditioner, razor, facial cleanser & soap in trial size bottles.

review/summary: Great Travel organizer!
review/text: Gals, this Hadaki travel organizer is GREAT!  Perfect size and wonderful quality.  I use 2 -  one for my makeup and one for my toiletries.  Having 2 separate one's allows for me to keep things separate and make any last minute adjustments to my carry-on luggage in case my suitcase is over 50 lbs!  If all your toiletries (shampoos, body washes, lotions, etc.) are together with your makeup, you can't carry them on (liquids & gels over 2 oz).  It rolls up, but holds alot and has a nice, sturdy metal hanger hook so you can hang them on the back of the hotel bathroom doors.  These Hadaki cases are made with fabulous quality and I love them!  So will you.

review/text: This was a little smaller than I thought, but my fault for not reading the measurements. It seems well made out of a vinyl type material and the color really pops in person. The mom I gave it to really loved it and thought it would fit all her necessities in an easy to organize and carry package, so missing accomplished Hadaki!

review/summary: Very good jerky
review/text: My wife gave me a package of Buffalo Bills "Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces" for my birthday. So being the cool guy that I am, I took it on a recent 4-wheeling trip and shared it with my compadres. Here's what they had to say:<br /><br />"WATER!!!!!!!!!!"<br /><br />LOL! Seriously, this IS good jerky. But it's a tad bit salty, and has a VERY distinct soy flavor. Maybe because the first three ingredients are beef, water, and soy. haha! If you do not like soy, you will NOT like this jerky. But that aside, it was a good-sized bag, and we demolished it in pretty short order. The pieces were not too big or small, and it was not chewy. It was maybe a tad bit hard, but it was not sinewy. This was premium beef - no grissel! I highly recommend this and other Buffalo Bills jerky products.<br /><br />Just be sure you have something to drink (it goes great with beer)!

Can't taste anything else.  Does seem a little greasy but it was on my step (delivered there) and it was 100 degrees today.  May have been from that.  Texture is the same but that salt.  Hope it's a fluke.  I'm calling them tomorrow!

You can tell immediately Jack Links is fake.<br /><br />This jerky has a nice smokey flavor.  It's tough and gives you something to chew on.<br /><br />I'll be buying this Jerky again and again.

They said if you don't like it, contact them and they'll make it right. Other reviewers mentioned the saltiness is only with this new lot, so check for their update when you order.

review/text: I'm known to be a salty person, so that may be why I like this so much. This is so much better than chewy jerky. I'd much rather have dry leathery jerky than chewy, greasy jerky. To me, jerky should be salty to help keep your sodium during a long trip or physical activity. I don't write reviews on Amazon much, but felt I should chime in on this product. Funny, but my local Sunoco station in Pgh carries this brand and it's the only one I buy, except if I visit my home state of Texas and go to Buccee's gas station where they have a full and I do mean FULL jerky deli style counter with all kinds of fresh jerky by the lb. It is a jerky lover's dream.

review/text: I am on an aircraft carrier, in the middle of the ocean and have been for 5 months now.  I orded this jerky and when it came in, I was salivating to try it.  Hands down the best jerky I have had, it wasn't full of tendons or fat, it wasn't chewy, and it wasn't as dry bark.  Perfect jerky, prime cuts of beef, the right texture and taste.  I shared two pieces out of the bag, then felt the urge to conserve the rest of the jerky for myself.  If you order a bag, order two, that way you can hide one for yourself then appear to be a giving soul with the other.  Keep it for yourself.<br /><br />Jason Cohen<br />Master Sergeant<br />USMC

They also said they were going to send me a replacement and assured me it would be good. I, of course, withdrew my original, neutral feedback and replaced it with this feedback.<br /><br />I am very very impressed with Buffalo Bill's customer service. Mistakes happen to everyone and it is the ones that step up and immediately resolve the issue like they did that get my full five star ratings such as this one.

review/text: I have ordered probably $500 of jerky from various online companies in the last 3 years and I can say this is for sure the best jerky I have ever had.  The hickory flavor is great and salty.  It's the kind of snack you just can't stop eating.  The other great thing is I like the pieces, instead of long strips.  It much nicer to be able to just pop bite size pieces in your mouth, rather than try and use your side molars to rip a long piece of jerky apart.  I have probably gone through eight bags of this product and have two in the cupboard.  Just do it.

But this Jerky which I got today with the soy sauce is really not my taste, it is absolutely salty, and the soy overpowers the meat flavor itself, and far as smoky flavor is concerned, there is none I can taste,the jerky is also unusually greasy, really coated in grease to be factual. I will personally only stick with ordering their "Country Cut" and their "Big Slabs" where you taste the good flavor of the meat, and the jerky is moist, but NOT greasy.

I thought of sending Ben this item, because he had<br />requested jerky as a comfort food while he was in Iraq. He and my daughter are now safely in Germany. Thank you again, Cassandra Rambo

review/summary: Too salty, doesn't taste like beef
review/text: I was really disappointed by this beef jerky, especially since I ordered a whole pound.  The jerky is way too salty, so much that I worried about the health effects.  Also, it tastes like it has been soaked in some kind of artificial beef broth that completely eliminates the natural beef flavor.  What is the point of that?  Why would anyone do that unless they are using inferior meat and looking for a quick path to flavor.  Trust me, it's not worth it.  Truly hickory-smoked beef just accentuating the flavor of the meat would be wonderful.

review/summary: Very smokey, too salty & a tough chew!
review/text: There were enough good reviews to give this beef jerky a try.<br /><br />It comes vacuum sealed, which should make for a long storage life... until you open it.  The bag isn't reclosable, so you need to transfer the contents to a reclosable container.<br /><br />This beef jerky comes in small pieces (strips), which we liked.  The color is black, very black... thought this was odd?  The smell is smokey... no beefy smell... not real appetizing.<br /><br />This beef jerky is "tough" & needs to be worked over (chewed) before you can enjoy the taste... that is, if you like very salty + smokey!  Still... the meat quality is good, with little gristle or inedible pieces.<br /><br />We wanted to like this beef jerky, but it's down there with one of the worst tasting that we've tried.  We won't be buying this beef jerky again!
