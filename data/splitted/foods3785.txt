review/summary: New Scent?
review/text: Seems like Dove came out with a new scent? I have 28 bars that dont' smell quite as good as the usual product bought from a local pharmacy or another seller on Amazon.com.  The soap does feel the same on my skin. I have already started using them and don't want to take the time or energy to return them.  Next time I'll check the seller.

review/summary: gentle, awesome beauty bars
review/text: Dove makes great soap for the shower or even if you're merely washing your hands. Although I personally consider this product to be soap, officially it's a "beauty bar" substitute for soap in that it contains a good amount of moisturizing lotion. Soap doesn't always moisturize; and so Dove tries to set their product apart from soap when they advertise the moisturizing abilities of their product. Rest assured, however, that you will find this item where the rest of the soap is stocked in your grocery store.<br /><br />The bars of soap are rather large but they don't slip out of your hands too easily; the shape of the bar helps you hold onto it. The Dove "beauty bars" do seem to truly help moisturize my skin when I use them to take a shower or wash my hands. The scent is mild but if you are sensitive to any scent you may want to use a completely unscented type of Dove soap.<br /><br />Dove is a little more expensive than other soaps but many people like me swear it's worth it. My best friend uses Dove religiously and he says it helps his skin a great deal. One reviewer wrote elsewhere that Dove soap is not particularly useful for acne; but I cannot personally comment on this because I do not have acne or other types of skin breakouts. I did notice, however, that two other people commented on that review and they stated that Dove soap did help them with their acne. If any skin condition is a concern for you, talk with your doctor or pharmacist before using this product.<br /><br />Overall, I love these Dove "beauty bars" with their moisturizing lotion. They are a bit more costly; but they are worth it if you want to pamper your skin in the shower or at the bathroom vanity sink. Pick up a package today and give yourself a little extra pampering!!!<br /><br />Enjoy!!!

review/summary: Mild, Just Like My Manners
review/text: No, I'm not beautiful, but I occasionally use a DOVE BEAUTY BAR.  This soap is as mild as your grandmother's smile; there are no harsh odors, scents, or irritants--just a no-nonsense bar that leaves soft, smooth skin.  And anyone who knows me knows I gotta be soft. . .<br /><br />In the winter my skin gets as dry as mule leather, so I'll shower with the DOVE BEAUTY BAR for moisturizing relief.  Ah, there's that soft feeling again.  And hey, this product is dermatologist recommended, so even the medical community is giving a thumbs up.  Good to buy in bulk, which is why DOVE BEAUTY BAR, WHITE, 4.25-OUNCE BARS IN 14-COUNT PACKAGES (PACK OF 2) is a good deal.  That's 28 bars of DOVE BEAUTY BARS.  That's a whole lot of soft.<br />--D.

review/summary: Wonderful Dove Beauty Bar!!!!
review/text: Bought this recently to try on my face.  I love it!  It lathers up so creamy and rich and feels like I'm washing my face in a creamy lotion.  Does not dry my skin out at all!  I like the fact that it has 1/4 moisturizing cream in it.  It makes my face feel so clean and takes my makeup off too, while softening it.  Best bar soap I've ever used, and I'm not really a bar soap individual because I love the moisturizing effects of body wash.  But...Dove bar soaps are just wonderful and they are not even like your typical bar soap...1,000 times better because they are so silky soft and moisturizing.  I use this for my shower, too and it feels amazing on my skin!  I highly recommend this beauty bar...well worth every penny!!!

I was pleasantly surprised when the complaints about my BO stopped.  It was embarrassing when my my dog would run away whimpering when I attempted to pet him.  The change in his behavior has made the change to the Dove soap worth it.  People have recently stopped me on the street inquiring about the type of soap I use, I proudly proclaim Dove.  Hopefully my praises will generate more business for this wonderful soap company.  I feel that this little white bar of soap will change my life.  Its that good!

review/summary: best balsamic vinegar ever
review/text: This balsamic vinegar is so incredible. I think the first time I bought it was at Marshall's or something discounted. It was an impulse buy. I had no idea what amazing product I had just stumbled onto. It is up there with my favorite tastes in life, including cherries, green tea powder, fresh yellow figs, loquats, strawberries, and chocolate. It was so good that when I saw it again at Wegman's, I started buying it. The last time I went to Wegman's, I couldn't find it so I ordered it online from the source in a bundle of six where you could pick what other vinegars you want to buy. You could buy all six of this or try some other kinds, too.<br /><br />It is sweet so if you don't like sweet things, this won't be for you. But if you like your salad dressings and other sauces a little sweet then you will like sweet balsamic vinegar, too. I have never tasted another balsamic vinegar that can even come close to this. It is very rich and thicker than regular balsamic vinegar. Regular balsamic vinegar is just a little too thin and vinegary for me unless I am just using it in a recipe. By itself, I like this sweet version better because it cancels some of that sharp vinegar taste.<br /><br />Here are some ways I use it. My favorite is to pour some olive oil into a dish and then pour less than an equal amount of the balsamic vinegar and dip french bread or similar bread. It also makes a great salad dressing mixed with olive oil and regular vinegar. I have even mixed it with a little soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and ginger to make a potsticker dipping sauce. You could mix it with just one of those items and still make a good potsticker dipping sauce. If you have found a good use for it, I would love to hear about it.<br /><br />I ordered the strawberry and blackberry ones, too, but haven't tried them, yet. It could be awhile before I open them. I was going to wait until I have guests over and it goes with what we are eating. It might be awhile.

review/summary: This vinegar is downright decadent!
review/text: If you love figs as much as I do, this fig balsamic vinegar won't disappoint.  The viscosity is almost like that of a light syrup and it's quite sweet.  On a salad, you don't need much to provide the rich, full flavor of figs with just a hint of vanilla.  I've used it with lemon juice a couple of times when I wanted a little less sweetness.  And using balsamic vinegars is a great way to cut down on oils in salad dressings because you can actually use them alone, without oil.  It's wonderful sprinkled over vegetables or used as a dipping sauce with sourdough bread.  Drizzling it over strawberries or fresh sliced nectarines is to die for.  I haven't tried it yet, but I can imagine this drizzled over vanilla ice cream, it's that rich.<br /><br />The ingredients listed on the label are:  Barrel aged Italian vinegar (5% acidity), fig paste (figs and fig concentrate), filtered water and extract of vanilla.  Nice, simple ingredients, without any chemical names that you have to look up on the internet.  That's what I look for in a product and it's one that I'll buy again.<br /><br />With it's artsy, attractive label it would make a great gift for a cook or a nice hostess gift when you want something a little unique.

review/summary: Great "Allowable" and Uniquely easy to have on hand
review/text: These little plastic single use wrapped pure honey pieces are awesome. They do get a little sticky inside the package if in your pocket, so when I open the packet I make sure to put the drop directly from the packet into my mouth so my hands don't get sticky, but compared to the mess of regular liquid honey, these are a terrific improvement.  Sugar is nasty to my system, causing a rebound hypoglycemia and hunger a couple hours later, so having a solid form of a healthy small volume of honey that doesn't cause the rebound and does satisfy early hunger pains from my typical fasting after 12 noon, is a terrific answer.  It permits an "allowable" to be ingested in the way allowables were intended, to dissuade true hunger pains with a small amount of allowable food, without it being a draw for a sensual pleasure.

It'll be a nice treat when other kids are having candy in other situations, too - they're all excited and so am I.<br /><br />The only holdback from five stars is that the manufacturer tells me the honey is pasteurized.  Alas, but this refined honey is way better than Laffy Taffy for their bodies and brains!

I was thrilled to find <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HXJQ7W">Honibe Honey Drop, 20-Count Individual Portions (Pack of 5)</a> on Amazon.  A solid serving of honey in an individual serving pack sounded perfect and I couldn't wait to try it.

I have tried several types of individual portion packets and the Honibe Honey Drop  packet is by far the most convenient. The Honibe Honey Drop single serving packet opens easily, and you can hold the dry honey in your hand without a sticky mess.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HXJQ7W">Honibe Honey Drop, 20-Count Individual Portions (Pack of 5)</a>, it's like a sugar cube, only better, it's honey.  Each individual piece equals a teaspoon of honey, it is 100% real honey, and each individual piece has 20 calories.  I love this product!

review/text: Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them.

review/text: Sometimes I am leery of whole grain products because even though they are better for you, some of them just don't taste good. This one not only tastes great, but the seasonings and flavorings for the chicken are fantastic. This is easily my favorite of the "Helper" varieties, and I am happy to see it in stores near me now. The honey mustard glaze that goes on the chicken is very true to taste- its almost identical in flavor to the honey mustard I use for sandwiches so if there wasn't enough of it, I could easily add to it, but its pretty much perfect the way it is. The only reason I only gave 4 stars is because it doesn't make as much as the box says it does like some of the other Helper titles. I usually go heavy on the chicken for this one to make sure it makes enough.

review/text: Add some chicken (any chicken!) to this boxed meal, and you have a scrumptious honey mustard chicken meal in about an hour. It does take a little longer to cook than some boxed meals, especially if you like your rice cooked down until it gets a softer texture. I like to add more water and cook an extra 10 - 15 minutes.<br /><br />You can shave some time off by using pre-cooked chicken instead of raw. Otherwise, I would definitely follow the instructions on the box, because I have tried short-cutting steps, and the honey mustard flavor just doesn't come out quite right. I wouldn't want to sacrifice that, since it really makes the meal!

review/summary: Great deal on here!
review/text: These smaller cans of French's French fried onions are getting scarce and more expensive in stores, so at $2.37 apiece this is a GREAT deal!<br /><br />$2.37 is with Amazon Prime shipping, which is really worth it.  These onions are best known for green bean casserole, but they are delicious on other casseroles, on salads, on baked potatoes, on hamburgers and other sandwiches, and on top of chilis and soups.  Get these while you can--they really liven up a boring meal.<br /><br />[...]

review/text: My first box of Chick-o-Stick individually wrapped pieces was wonderful.  I finished it right away, so I ordered another box.  Am a little disappointed with the second box, quite a few of the pieces are so hard they almost appear to be fossilized or petrified.  Some of those pieces are so hard, I'm afraid I'm going to break a tooth.  I really like Chick-0-Stick candy so I'm hoping it's just a fluke, and that the rest of this box will be great.

It tastes like a butterfinger without the chocolate.  I LOVE them, and these are the perfect little bite-sized pieces.  Nice to have on the desk at work.  They used to be amazon prime shipping, and here's hoping they go back to it!  I've ordered snacks/candy on Amazon before and have gotten some very stale products, but these were fresh and good.

review/summary: Would you like a cup of 'fish' tea?
review/text: Bilberry....it sounded so...so....tasty.  I am sure that this tea is good for your health and for that reason I give it the 3 stars. Unfortunately, it smells and tastes like fish which is something I just cannot tolerate.  I tried it several times and just could not drink it.  I have a close friend who is Asian and she likes it, but she eats a lot of fish sauce so I guess her tastebuds are adapted to that taste.  Not mine.  I would also say that I am not a finicky eater (I do eat fish), and I do tolorate a lot of tastes for the sake of eating healthy, including eating things on the bitter side - but 'fishy' is hard for me to swallow!  So, for now, I will have to try something else.  Anyone know what hawthorn berry tea taste like?

I also read on other websites that if consumed long term, may have side affects. Discontinuing this tea for sure.

review/text: ...even though we own 2 or 3 "real" pepper mills. These are relatively small, so the peppercorns stay fresh throughout each one's lifespan (they are not refillable). This also means it's convenient to keep on the table, and even small kids can operate it with no problem. The peppercorns are middle-of-the-road in flavor and spiciness.<br /><br />When the 6-pack is on sale it's a great deal. I brought one to work, one went into the camping gear...<br /><br />The bottles are glass, but pretty heavy and sturdy. One was dropped on our tile floor and survived with no chips or cracks (though I wouldn't recommend testing this for yourself!)<br /><br />Our only gripe: the cap does not fit tightly and so is constantly falling off. But you need it to keep the moisture out and the dusty bits in (when it gets knocked over).

I did not know that Chestnut Blossom Honey ever existed!  So I went to my Amazon.com & ordered it.  It came promptly & when I opened the jar of honey, I was welcomed to a wonderful fragrance of the Chestnut Blossom.  The flavor is rich & simply put totally rocks.  I made Chestnut Honey Pound Cake & Chestnut Honey-Chocolate Coffee Cake/Tea Cake to die for.  I guess is not too late to learn.  Those Italians know a thing or two or more about cooking as well.  Love this product, I will continue to buy this product again and again.

So I found this product and knew it was the perfect idea. I sampled one of the drinks myself, and was very pleased with the taste. It didn't explode when I opened it, but it was a bit difficult.<br /><br />The only real problem I had was that two of the bottles had torn labels when they arrived. I was hoping my brother could keep the bottles as a momento. I didn't want to give my brother the damaged bottles which is why I kept those two for myself.<br /><br />Other than the damaged labels I was pleased with the product, and the speed in which it arrived.

review/summary: Tasty, but opening a bottle can be a hassle.
review/text: These soda's are tasty and unique. They are fragrant rather then *BOOM cola flavor*. Opening them is a bit annoying though.. When you unwrap the wrapper, then you see the marble lock which acts like the cap to your typical soda bottle.. Not this one though lol, they provide you with a piece of plastic to open your soda. You line it up, push down hard on it and *pop* your soda is open.<br /><br />Personally I've had mixed results with opening these, a few times the soda ushered out like champagne. Other times the marble just drops down and nothing gets spilled. So I would suggest you open your drink in the sink. First glance at the price of [...] isn't too bad. That would be cheaper in markets where you can usually find them $2-3 per unit. Second look.. [...] (shipping) ouch. That drastically changes the good deal. If you live near an Asian market, chances are you'll probably find these.

review/text: Taste good, but a bit different than traditional western soda. Not too sweet, maybe a little more carbonated than it should be, so kids will think it has a mildly spicy taste. The prices for this package are a bit high, probably because of how much packaging is involved for shipping, but other than that, good product. I have bought each of these individual Ramune at an Asian Super Market. Each bottle costs $1.99, and my local Asian supermarket offers one free when you buy two. If you live in/near a fairly large city, just use Google maps to find an Asian supermarket near you that has Japanese goods and buy from there.

review/summary: Great for iced tea!
review/text: Over the years I have tried making iced tea out of dozens of different herbal teas and most just end up tasting like lightly-flavored water.  This Yogi Sweet Thai Delight tea is the first I've tried that I will make again.  As a matter of fact, I intend to have a jug of it in the refrigerator all summer!  The taste is amazingly sweet (but not in a sugary way) and a little nutty (actually "coconut-ty.")  I don't use sweeteners or milk in my tea as a rule, but even if I did I wouldn't want to add sugar to this tea, it's perfectly sweet as it is.<br /><br />Since there's no recipe for iced tea on the box, I just winged it and put 8 tea bags into a gallon of boiling water, then turned it down and let it steep covered for about twenty minutes.  You could probably also make it the way my Mom made tea in the summer, by putting the bags in a gallon jar, adding room temperature water, sealing it and setting it in the sunniest place in the yard for the day.<br /><br />However you make it, you really should try this tea iced.  I'm not a huge tea drinker normally, but I'm completely hooked on this one.

review/text: I first had the opportunity of having this tea about 13 years ago.  The blend used for this tea is very smooth.  I have tried several other chai green tea brands, but none can compare to Yogi Tea.  I have allowed several friends, and co-workers to sample this tea, and all are hooked on it.  I have also tried the redbush chai, and black chai teas from Yogi Tea, all were very good but the taste of the chai green is superb by far.  Follow the directions, allowing the tea to steep, to get the full effect, you won't be disappointed.  I usually use white sugar only as a sweentener, but have also used Equal sweetener.  Thank you Yogi Tea for a wonderful tea.

review/text: Although this tea is flavorful and tastes fine, I should have read the description more carefully. I was looking for pure licorice root tea. This tea has other spices added to it and the orange peel flavor is dominant and licorice flavor is muted. I am giving it three stars because the name of the tea should include some of the other spices. Read the ingredients listed before you purchase. Here is the description, "Combined with a touch of cinnamon, orange peel and other carefully selected herbs and spices" If you like these other spices then you will be happy. Otherwise, you might opt for a pure licorice tea and the box will say, "Ingredients: Licorice Root". That was what I really wanted, although this tea tastes perfectly good.

The licorice flavor doesn't intensify with longer steeping time so if you want tht flavor to be more intense you have to use two bags.  My husband hates this tea though, he is Japanese and it reminds him of the herbal tonics they made him drink as a kid!

review/text: I didn't expect this to be so spicy! It smells great but when you taste it, it's nasty! I sweetened it as much as I could but it just didn't help. This is a shame since I like so many other Yogi teas. I'll have to pawn off the rest to friends and family now :(

review/summary: My absolute favorite
review/text: I love this tea. Spicy sweet,  If your first pick in the chocolate aisle is the one with the hottest chili nibs, this is your no-calorie alternative.<br />However, we must talk about the price on Amazon.  I'm searching the site because I first encountered the tea while on vacation in New York City.  Fairway carries it for about half the price of listed here.

review/summary: Great for iced tea!
review/text: Over the years I have tried making iced tea out of dozens of different herbal teas and most just end up tasting like lightly-flavored water.  This Yogi Sweet Thai Delight tea is the first I've tried that I will make again.  As a matter of fact, I intend to have a jug of it in the refrigerator all summer!  The taste is amazingly sweet (but not in a sugary way) and a little nutty (actually "coconut-ty.")  I don't use sweeteners or milk in my tea as a rule, but even if I did I wouldn't want to add sugar to this tea, it's perfectly sweet as it is.<br /><br />Since there's no recipe for iced tea on the box, I just winged it and put 8 tea bags into a gallon of boiling water, then turned it down and let it steep covered for about twenty minutes.  You could probably also make it the way my Mom made tea in the summer, by putting the bags in a gallon jar, adding room temperature water, sealing it and setting it in the sunniest place in the yard for the day.<br /><br />However you make it, you really should try this tea iced.  I'm not a huge tea drinker normally, but I'm completely hooked on this one.

review/text: My mom gave me licorice tea whenever I had a bad throat, and it really was soothing to my throat.  This works just as well!<br /><br />Now, if you really really dislike the flavor of licorice, you might want to stay away from this tea.  I don't typically like licorice (I can tolerate it), but this isn't too bad.  Sometimes I drink it just for the scent and flavor.

I like to make the tea strong and then add some soy milk to it to make it creamy.  It becomes a Chai Latte without all of the sugar you get from the Chai syrups used in coffee shops.  It's also good cold.

review/summary: lots of flavours in each sip
review/text: A colleague at work just gave me one of these tea bags.<br /><br />I like herbal teas but this one was really unique.<br />There were really nice lingering flavors on my tongue with every sip.<br />First, a tangy orangey sensation followed by a suttle sweetness married with a spicy masala kick shortly after.<br />The sweetness lingers around the back of the tongue afterwords.<br /><br />Nothing really Mexican about it, neither does it have any chilis. The spiciness comes from some common spices used in Masala tea.<br /><br />If this sounds like something you might like, I highly recommend that you try it.

review/summary: Spicey goodness
review/text: I'm addicted to Yogi Teas and have vowed to try them all.  This Indian Spice tea is delicious. I've found that many of the Yogi teas are not as strong as I want them to be, so the tea bag stays in until I've drank all the tea. Not so with this tea, this tea has a VERY strong Cinnamon taste, which I find enjoyable. In truth, I may have left the bag in too long today, as the cinnamon flavor is burning a little.<br />The directions on the box say to add milk (or milk substitute) and sweetener to the tea. They mean it. I tried to drink it plain, but couldn't, it just didn't taste right. However, I did add a popular flavored coffee creamer, and that worked beautifully.  This is a whole new drink now, doesn't feel like tea, it feels like a treat. Enjoy.

review/summary: Another Good Choice in Organic Cookies
review/text: After my positive experience with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUT89A">Health Valley Cookie Cremes, Double Chocolate</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027CE2S">Newman's Own Organics Newman-O'S Ginger-O's, 16-Ounce Packages</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027CE2I">Newman's Own Organics Alphabet Cookies, Cinnamon, 10-Ounce Bags</a>, I thought I would give Country Choice a go.  So far, I'm "4-for-4" in ordering good organic cookies.  I took a chance and bought them without trying them first.  I'm happy to say I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Country Choice Organic Ginger Lemon is a good tasting cookie that have all the benefits of sweetness we would expect from cookies, but lacking the artificial ingredients consistent with cookies commonly on the market.  The cookies are lighter than other organic cookies I've tried, but the taste is quite strong and the cookies are sweet, a surprise from my initial introduction to organic cookies that had the flavor and consistency of the cardboard box they were stored in.<br /><br />There are some points the consumer needs to know; they may be minuses for some, but they're certainly pluses for me:<br /><br />1) The cookies are VERY sweet; I had to have a glass of milk with them.  While I adore sweet cookies, it may turn some people off.  Be mindful of that.<br /><br />2) The taste of ginger is overwhelmed by the strongest taste of lemon in cookies I've ever had.  To me this would be a significant minus, except that I absolutely love the lemony taste in cookies.  The aroma is heavenly, but the taste is so powerful it seems almost artificial.  Oddly, I can taste a hint of ginger when they're dunked in milk (any explanation from food chemists/scientists out there?).  Again I love that taste, but others may not.  If you want the gingery taste, you would have to be an expert food taster to find it here (in my opinion).<br /><br />3) While these cookies are made with organic and natural ingredients (no hydrogenated oils or trans fats), they're still cookies: they are loaded with sugar, sodium and carbs.  Two cookies pack a whopping 130 calories; 50 calories from fat.  Remember, organic does not always mean healthy.  And because these cookies are lighter than other organic cookies I've tried, and very tasty, it is very easy to overeat them.<br /><br />4) These cookies (barely) pass my all-important "dunkability" test, where they adequately absorb milk to compliment the flavor of the cookies (Oreo's, despite their artificial ingredients, is still king in the dunkability of cookies, in my honest opinion).  They taste delicious when dunked, but these cookies begin to fall apart quickly, so holding them under milk for a length of time could be problematic.<br /><br />Given the minuses I've indicated, you wonder: why do I give it four stars.  Simple: I love them.  Taste, like beauty, is in the eye (or palate) of the beholder.  And I can't get enough of them.  While my opinion is unquestionably biased, I try to give as much unbiased information on the product as I can.  Use it to make your decision.<br /><br />As with all Amazon grocery products, I recommend going to a supermarket or specialty store (Whole Foods, for example), buy a single pack and sample the cookies before you buy the entire case.  I took a gamble and bought the case untested; it's a gamble that has paid dividends for me.

review/text: These chocolate cookies are an organic version of Oreo-type cookies but are far superior than that name brand, in my opinion.  They are seriously addicting and I cannot buy them anymore because I tend to eat toooooooo many and the package is gone in a couple/few days.  They are not particularly healthy - they are a cookie, after all!  The cookie part is nice and crunchy (almost tending toward light and crisp) with an excellent chocolate flavor.  The filling is great - smooth and creamy (does not get hard like some other oreo-types) with a good degree of sweetness.  I have also tried the Paul Newman brand of oreos and was not that impressed.  The Country Choice far exceeds all other brands - highly recommend!

review/summary: Loving the Lemon
review/text: I have never in my life written a review on any product until today. These cookies have compelled me to speak out! The Ginger Lemon is just great! The ginger is not over powering and the lemon is tart and sweet. Together, they are amazing. But, even better, in my opinion, split the cookie open! I love to eat the crispy ginger outer shell and then savor the lemony middle. The only down side, I can eat the whole package in one sitting!

review/summary: Super Yummy, Not Super Healthy
review/text: Organic does not equal healthy. OK?<br /><br />That out of the way, these are super yummy. Far better than Newman's Ginger-O (and I'm usually a big Newman Organics fan) and the hint of lemon is very, very good.<br /><br />These are addictive in a Girl Scout Cookie kind of way and, yeah, I do think they're a better choice than, say, Oreos, but this is still a processed snack food, no doubt about it, albeit one with an ingredient list you can actually pronounce.

review/summary: Definitely a five-star item
review/text: I agree with all the other reviewers who state that these are delicious lemon cookies. However, one stated that they are extremely lemony, which I did not find. They are sweet and lemony, but not excessively at all. Perhaps our lemon perceptors are quite different. Anyway, they are terrific, and this is coming from someone raised on Oreos, etc. who is very picky about their organic and natural products measuring up in taste to the tasty junk out there.<br />Amazon shipped them quickly and well packaged also.

review/summary: Absolute fabulous
review/text: These cookies are great! I did not think that I would find anything that even remotely come close to oreo, but they do. Actually, I like these better. You can eat as many as you want and not get sick. Try that with  non-organic cookies. When eating organic cookies, you actually taste the quality. You will not get a sugar rush (headache) like the rest.

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: These delicious cookies are free of trans fats.  They do have 130 calories in two cookies, so one should practice moderation.  We have been enjoying them for years, particularly in Vanilla, but they can be difficult to find.  Amazon offers them at a good price.  The cookies are available in Ginger-Lemon, as well, which are good sometimes for variety.

review/summary: Yummy!!
review/text: These are delicious.  My teenage daughter likes them much better than any other brand.  She says they soak up milk better when dipped.  And it's nice that there is no trans fat or high fructose corn syrup!
