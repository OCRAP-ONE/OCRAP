review/text: We love Pete's choice, lemon, mist diet grapefruit, energy and the rootbeers.  Really the only one we didn't like was berry seltzer flavoring.  We leave out about 1/10 of the syrup and the sodas were PERFECT.  We love this machine-especially extra fizzy!

review/summary: Syrups were fine. Packaging lead to receiving damaged product...twice
review/text: Getting syrups is a must to properly enjoy your sodamaker, which is a great buy. I have the Penguin model, and I absolutely love it.<br /><br />However...the Sodastream Sodamix Variety 12-Pack has let me down twice now. When I first ordered it, it came a sticky mess - one of the packets had burst open. I returned it. The second time I ordered it, the box was merely soiled. Another packet had been punctured. The rest were ok, and I didn't have enough confidence in them to return it for another variety pack in the mail.<br /><br />Make sure to never order this item with other items, lest they be damaged in transit. If you do, request that they ship it separately. You've been warned.

review/summary: Terrible Flavors, but Good Variety
review/text: We received a SodaStream for Christmas this year. I bought this variety pack so I could sample the various flavors without having to invest in a large bottle of each. I'm grateful that I bought this variety pack or my house would now be full of large bottles of disgusting flavored syrup.<br /><br />There are 6 regular flavors and 6 diet flavors. The flavor selection is good. We were so excited to try them.<br /><br />For us, the only flavor that was drinkable was the lemon-lime, which really did taste almost as good as name brand 7-Up. The orange and root beer flavors were disgusting. All of them, except the lemon-lime, left a terrible aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />Still, this kit was nicely packaged and the kids did have a lot of fun trying out the different flavors. I just wish they would have tasted better!

review/summary: Nice way to try flavors, but ENERGY is best! Similar to Red Bull
review/text: This came with a SodaStream unit I bought at a "club" store.  I think Amazon does not have the SodaStream units due to shipping issues with the C02 tanks.<br /><br />Really a nice product, and easy to use.  The 12 pack lets you try some popular flavors, and get to know the unit.  Some flavors are better than others - oddly enough , I thought the "cola" was least desireable.  The "Diet Pink Grapefruit" was outstanding - similar to Fresca. "Orange" was good, as was "Root Beer".<br /><br />The "Energy" flavor is VERY CLOSE to Red Bull, and is what I use most. When you try it, you will want to get a full size flavor bottle. If you happen to like the taste , and benefits of energy drinks, you will love this. When one does the math, this can be a real savings!<br /><br />SodaStream seems to be making more and more flavors, and recently inked a deal with Kraft for some of their well known flavors.<br /><br />I like the idea of having the sample packs available - if only for guests.  I would also note that the Amazon price is BETTER than what I saw today at a retailer best known as a sponsor for the Thanksgiving Day Parade!<br /><br />As others have noted, just 'snip' off the top of the sample packs, and add the flavor s l o w l y  to your carbonated bottle for best results.<br /><br />I figure if you are reading this, you already have a SodaStream, or are on the fence about getting one. Hope this help's a bit. For the "Energy" flavor alone, this entire system makes sense.<br /><br />This 12-pack would make a nice gift to new system owners, to help them along.  I would certainly think it might be nice for seniors or college students- sometimes people cant easily get to stores.

review/text: So, if you have read the negative reviews on the flavors, all I can say is that we Americans just love to gripe. Taste is going to be up to the individual. My entire family love the SodaStream and this pack gave us a great start on some flavors. Will you love them all? Not likely? I personally didn't care for the cola, but that is ME. You will get hooked to your SodaStream, and this flavor pack will help. I wish that SodaStream would offer assorted packs like THIS one. It is a good way to get people exposed to the offerings and THAT is why this gets 4 stars and not 5. It is the only "variety" pack that they currently offer.

review/summary: A must have for any new SodaStream owner
review/text: For just over $1 per liter you can taste SodaStream's most popular flavors before committing to an entire bottle of syrup.  I'm glad I did this because we were able to identify which flavors my family would and would not drink.  Our faves, even for the non-diet drinkers were Diet Pink Grapefruit and Diet Cranberry-Raspberry.  Both contain Splenda.  The Energy drink makes a great replacement for Red Bull, particularly due to the cost savings.  Overall, my family believes the flavors are noticeably different than brand names, but for the cost savings, will grin and bear it.  Even if you only replace your soda drinking with SodaStream partially you're benefiting your wallet and your body!

review/text: Got this with my Sodastream Genesis, & I thought it was pretty cool that it came with some of the flavors in sample size. Ive used about 1/2 or so because I dont really like diet drinks.<br /><br />My only thought is that it might be a good idea to have a mix & match option if you like some types or flavors but not others & maybe sell them as singles as well. Overall definitely a neat idea though I wouldnt buy this particular set of 12 again.<br /><br />If your new to Sodastream & or some of their flavors I would recommend this so you can get a general idea what some of the flavors are about.

review/summary: Tastes good, saves money.
review/text: I really don't know what all the whining is about. I purchased one and was pleasantly suprised. My budget for energy drinks was getting ridiculous but the SodaStream energy drink was a huge cash saver. It does not tasted exactly like Red Bull. More like the knock off sold at K-Mart called Loop Energy. All of the flavors I tried are pretty good with no real complaints. You want nasty soda? Try ordering a Coke in a cafe in Germany. Warm and flat. I found the quality of water also effects the flavor of the soda. I use the cold filtered water from my fridge dispenser. The one time I tried plain tap water it did not taste so good. I also experimented with Mio syrup and I must admit it was not bad at all. Splenda? Yeah, so what? Not half as bad for you as aspartame and corn syrup. Some people are highly allergic to artificial sweetners so it gets a bad rap. My parents go through Caffeine Free Diet Coke like its water and I am considering buying one for them. I'm looking forward to this company producing more flavors in the future and maybey expanding their energy drink line.

review/text: I love the premise of the SodaStream.  I loved the idea of not lugging heavy bottles of soda home from the store.  I loved the idea of not having to save and return bottles to get back my deposit.  But......the soda flavors all definitely disappoint.  I only tried the Lemon-Lime and Rootbeer, and decided they both tasted odd and too sweet.  I literally couldn't/didn't want to even attempt to finish either liter.  Count me in on this machine if Pepsi/Coke actually offer their syrups for use.  Til then, I'm taking this back for a refund. :(

You can find much better alternatives; e.g. the Torani syrups actually taste good and are not disgustingly sweet like this "stuff."

review/summary: As bad as it gets
review/text: For a long time I thought there were two kinds of soda: the big brands like Pepsi and Coca Cola, and then all the terrible tasting small brands. However, after purchasing a SodaStream I learned that there's a 3rd category that's even worse than the terrible small brand sodas: SodaStream flavors.<br /><br />These things taste absolutely horrible. Not a single one tastes anything like the flavor it's trying to imitate. Every flavor tastes like it came straight out of a New Jersey chemical factory. There wasn't a single flavor that I could trick myself into drinking.<br /><br />Bottom line: SodaStream makes carbonated water real well, but that's it. They completely fail at flavor additives.

review/summary: love sodastream soda maker but not its syrups
review/text: we love sodastream soda maker but not its syrups.  my bf is a soda addict, drink soda like water, who sneaks out to a deli, which is at least 15 mins away as the closest ones closed at midnight, for a 2 Liter bottle of cherry coke at 3am in the morning. i bought the sodastream jet starter kit and this sodamix variety pack for him as i don't want to buy bottles of sodas from supermarket, carrying them walking at least 2 flights of stairs, separating the trash for recycle and dragging bags of empty bottles out which he promised he will help but rarely does. i bought sodastream totally because i m lazy but not being eco-friendly at all. the 1st day we received them, he made 4 different flavors and made me to finish them all with him that night. he loves to play with the loud buzz button and constantly needs new bottle for another flavor as the starter kit comes with only 1 bpa free bottle.  i never like anything fizzy while he likes it bubbles until his blood fizz like the soda. we tried #1.fountain mist #2.orange #3. lemon-lime #4.diet cola respectively. he hates anything "diet" and complained even the non diet syrups taste like diet. the last one he tested from the variety pack was the diet cola as it doesn't come with the regular cola which he craved. i said the diet cola taste like the regular cola n yuck. he agreed with the yuck but blah blah blah about the taste different between the regular coka cola coke n this sodamix diet cola syrup.  he believed that the sodamix regular cola syrup must be better than the diet one and planned to get it the next day. suddenly he screamed out "splen-daaaaa" in a weird accent while he was reading the ingredients/ nutrition facts. he lost interests in this variety pack and tried to fizz everything drinkable in the fridge: #5. welch's white grape cherry juice just by itself without water, it exploded while the bottle is still intact to the machine, mess everywhere, he said "errrk". #6. water+ribena, considering carbonating the juice creates messes, we just carbonated the water and substitute the syrup with something else, with the same amount of the individually packaged syrup from the variety pack, ribena isnt as concentrated, i continued added more ribena but still taste bland and ended up ran out of ribena. #7. we bought the sodamix regular cola from BB&B the today, while pouring the syrup in after carbonating the water, it just splashed all over the counter top and the kitchen floor. better pour it inside the sink.  he said it tastes better than the diet syrup but still has a slightly aspartame/weird sugar after taste, not as good as the regular coca cola. #8. carbonated water+OJ: 1/4 cup of carbonated water + 3/4 cup of no pulp OJ = taste is ok, less strong, not fizzy. 1/2 cup of carbonated water + 3/4 cup of no pulp OJ: not fizzy and taste only with a tint of OJ. 1 cup of carbonated water + 1 cup of no pulp OJ, fizzy but bland.  We bought the sodamix cherry cola syrup, but we r full from drinking carbonated sugared liquid these 2 days. we will try it and update tomorrow.

I make them somewhat to what the package suggests, but I add more water, not to much that dilutes the flavor, but enough to give me more broth cause I like it. Oriental is a unique flavor but oh so good. I buy mine at my local store because luckily I find it because on here it's pretty pricey. For those who haven't already I would give it a try.

review/summary: CONTAINS BEEF EXTRACT - MISSING FROM AMAZON INGREDIENT LIST!
review/text: I hate to give this a low-star review for a mistake that Amazon made in the listing - but as a vegetarian, I was very disappointed to see that this ramen had beef extract.  This was missing from the listing - I wouldn't have purchased it if the ingredient list was complete. :(<br />The noodles themselves are fine - just not the bouillon packet.

review/summary: Ramen for my shelf
review/text: I consume a lot of ramen.  My typical choices are either Korean brands or some other imports.  Maruchan has always been a cheaper option for those of us who just want a piping hot bowl of noodles on the fly.  I order this just like my other Maruchan orders to mix with different food or to serve with additional toppings.  The price I paid at the time was cheaper than the store which was great but it has gone back up.

review/summary: Simply Delish!!
review/text: I tried this sauce on a whim, when I saw it in Whole Foods Market. It had a local label and I'm all 'gung ho' for trying out products made locally. I wasn't sure what to expect so I tasted a little bit before mixing it with my other ingredients, and was initially surprised that it truly tasted like its name as well as very authentic. But boy was I surprised after I used this with a stuffed shells recipe and really tasted the flavors! The flavoring of the herbs in the sauce were simply robust and just delicious, complimenting my other ingredients extremely well. I vowed never to buy commercial pasta sauces ever again, but this certainly changed my mind. This is very close to making a sauce from scratch, in my opinion. If you're skeptical, I would suggest buying a jar from your local health food store before buying in bulk...you won't regret it!

review/summary: Oooh, what donuts !!!
review/text: Entenmanns's Donuts are the perfect solution when you need a sugar kick for extra energy when you're on the run; and they go very well with coffee or tea. I've been eating these for ages; and they never fail to do the trick!<br /><br />The box is sealed so when you open the box for the very first time you will need to pull away the side and the front box covers; this ensures freshness and quality control. I would store these in a refrigerator either before or after opening. They are pretty tasty when cold. However, you can serve them or eat them yourself when they are at room temperature as well. In addition, these donuts are kosher if that matters to you.<br /><br />These donuts offer variety: three of them are chocolate covered with a yellow cake filling; three are plain; three are glazed and three more still have sugary crumbs on them to really give you a treat! I love them all but occasionally the plain ones can be a little dry for my personal taste. Their small size makes them easy to carry when you're on the go; and the individual donuts easily fit into a child's school lunch box, too. I would recommend wrapping the donuts in some sort of paper or small plastic bag so that any donut crumbs won't go all over other food or anything else that a person is carrying.<br /><br />These donuts, predictably, have their drawbacks. They are loaded with sugar; and sugar can turn to fat inside your body if you don't get enough exercise. Check the nutrition facts label before buying to see if the carbohydrate content is "OK" for your diet. As for me, I would not eat these donuts every day because of my diet.<br /><br />Overall, however, these donuts are some treat! They make for the perfect snack when you're on the run; and they can be an after school snack, too. They even go well with coffee or tea when company comes to visit! Pick up a box and enjoy these tonight!

review/summary: A Very Delicious, VERY Versatile MULTI - TASKER
review/text: I like to make my positive reviews as educational, encouraging, helpful and authentic as possible. My sugar-loving, ultra-nit-picky, processed-food-loving family members have all flown the coop so I'm FINALLY re-learning high-nutrition cooking (like Mother Earth News had inspired me towards 20+ years ago) and these Bob's Red Mill products are making my transition super-easy, tasty, creative and fun. This Natural Granola was the first `Bob's' item that I had tried out because I knew it would be more versatile for adding into other recipe's and I could simulate his other granola mixes because I always keep spices and dried fruit bits on hand (for adding to foods AND ESPECIALLY to reconstitute for natural sweeteners).<br />~ THE #1 THING THAT I"VE LIKE THE BEST ABOUT THIS GRANOLA is that it seems so filling to me that I've naturally and effortlessly reduced my portions, which is important for getting our stomach's back to a healthy / natural size without unpleasant brain associations or, in my case triggering my hypoglycemia).  THE #1 ADVANTAGE FOR EVERYONE ELSE WOULD BE HOW PHENOMINALLY VERSATILE THIS NATURAL GRANOLA IS FOR COUNTLESS DISHES & MEALS, SOOooo NEVER assume that healthier eating has to be tasteless, bland or boring !!<br />~ Breakfast Suggestions:  For my taste I didn't need to add much sweetener at all, it's great either with just cold milk, or when I cook it I add in a little ginger and/or cinnamon (VERY health-benefitting spices) plus either a bit of honey or a sparse touch of molasses (bolder flavor and much cheaper than honey), or I sweeten it with a touch of stevia leaves or reconstituted dried fruits (in winter).  BUT, I also add some granola to my pancake mix, muffins and sprinkle it into my cooked 10-grain cereals to add some interesting texture.<br />~ Snacks: After realizing how filling (AND nutritious) it was, I tried out several of the easy, home-made granola-mix recipe's that I found online and saved it in the smallest Rubbermaid containers; it always filled me up when I was debating between a snack, a sandwich or a `meal'.  It's so much-healthier-than-cookies and far more environmentally friendly than the over-priced 100-calorie snack-packs, I also learned to add it to yogurt cups to make it more filling and to feel fuller longer, and I've begun trying some very-healthy low-cal cookie recipe's which I've added this granola (only making them about the size of most cookies)<br />~ Cooking:  You can add this granola almost ANYWHERE you use fillers or bread crumbs, including (but not limited to): adding some to the coating for your veggies or meats before frying, definitely add some to your stuffing / dressings to add flavor to FINALLY retain a better-than-mush texture, experiment by adding some to soups, stews or even chili for more substance and for a passive thickener (no kidding!), it made my sloppy-joe's and meatloaf more awesome than ever, it can add healthy nutrients and texture to almost any casserole (replace those unhealthy French-fried onions!) and it definitely goes great in goulash;<br />~ Baking: FIRST, if there's any chance that anyone is allergic to nuts, use granola for a fabulous substitute.  I've been having so much fun, success and getting raves by adding this granola to muffins, breads, graham cracker crusts, carrot / coffee cakes, BREAD PUDDING, cookies, pies (again acts somewhat like a mild/passive thickener), into the filling of bundt cakes, it's phenomenal in carmel/sweet-rolls, IT'S FABULOUS in frostings like caramel-coconut over german chocolate, and I'd better stop before your drooling shorts out your keyboard :)<br />~ SOME FINAL TIPS:<br />#1): When whole-grain portions are adjusted DOWN to natural, nutritional-needs-sized portions (and you'll see this echoed across numerous product revives) these cereals ACTUALLY ARE LESS EXPENSIVE than the mega-processed, bloating cereals we've been media-blasted into becoming addicted to.<br />#2): We humans DO have the adequate brainpower to begin incorporating healthier ingredients into our families diets within your means; such as: we can purchase JUST ONE PACKAGE of most of the Bob's products at most local grocery stores for trying them out, experimenting and adjusting to them,  then save money by ordering, pantry-ing and saving money via the larger quantities here on Amazon.  I've now purchased several more of the `Bob's' products like the 10-grain cereals, Flaxseed, etc., WHICH I've also been adding into my recipe's; the point is that WE CAN find numerous ways to add a little more nutrition to our meals.<br />#3):  IT'S FUNNY how my family members (and their boyfriends/girlfriends) have been liking my healthier recipe's so much that they've begun to ask more about the recipe's and ingredients.  And after their initial shock that they actually liked things that were very nutritious, they're needed to address their negative prejudices about genuinely healthy ingredients and foods and have begun opening their minds (I WISH THAT I HAD INSISTED ON MAINTAINING MY VALUE OF NUTRITION BEING THE HIGHEST PRIORITY WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE SMALL).<br /> #4): I'm betting that Bob would agree that whether we choose his products or a similar product or the most nutritious that we can afford, we've all got to realize that there are countless reasons (the health care crisis being only one reason) why we absolutely must improve our eating habits AND try to be as environmentally considerate as we do so.<br />#5):  I have successfully tried several of the recipe's that are printed on the `Bob's' packages, but while I was at the library the other day I noticed a Bob's Red Mill Cookbook and `Baking Book'!  Although I was too short on time to investigate them, I knew that if I had found dozens of ways to successfully incorporate these healthier ingredients into my dishes and meals, imagine what they could offer with all their experience and resources, I ordered it here on Amazon and I'll recommend that everyone at least consider look into their cooking books if you're serious about learning to incorporate healthier ingredients into your dishes and meals.

review/text: Now that I'm stuck with 4 bags of this stuff, I'm trying to muscle through it (can't bring myself to throw it away)... but I really miss my old granola.  This product is too sweet, and has another taste (vanilla?) that I can't quite place but I find distracting from what should just be a good granola taste.  On a positive side, it's of good consistency and arrived tasting very fresh.  But usually I just can't eat enough granola, and with this product I feel like I'm taking medicine - it's not tasty.<br /><br />I'm mixing this in with cereal... perhaps this granola would be better suited for baking.  Sorry, I can't give this oatmeal my full endorsement.

review/text: I am not much for Earl Greys; to me, they tend to be average. This one is not. It has a great, but not at all overpowering, bergamot flavor. The bergamot flavor is smoothed out by the slight hint of vanilla and cream that is barely noticeable, but effective). I normally drink tea with milk but prefer this one on its own because it is so tasty, smooth, and absolutely well balanced. It avoids the bitterness often gotten from black tea and from lesser Earl Greys. Because of its flavor and its (relatively) decent price, I think this tea will become a mainstay in my house.

review/text: I was a little hesitant to try these because of the price, but I am so glad I did.  These are incredible!  The almonds, pistachios, pepitas (pumpkin seeds), and cashews are roasted in a way that makes them almost crispy.  They are bound together into little bites with a fragile coating of delicious toffee, and then dipped into dark chocolate.  I wish I could describe how they almost shatter in your mouth with a very pleading crunch.  The combination of the different nuts, toffee, and dark chocolate was much better than I expected too.  These were just too delicious!  The four of us ate the whole large bag in one sitting.  They were that good!  They aren't inexpensive though, so save them for holidays or special events.  I found it amusing that they came in a resealable bag.  I challenge anyone to not finish them once they open them!

review/text: This mushroomy mix of dehydrated veggies and spices makes a sauce that you might have in a village restaurante of the wooded hills of Tuscany. Comes with real mushrooms and well proportioned spices and vegetables that simply need to be reconstituted in 1 cup of boiling water.  Add some olive oil to saute' a couple of minutes, then add some tomatoes or canned tomatoes.  Cook it down for about 15-20 minutes at a medium flame and serve over penne or other pasta that was cooked separately.  This is real food for 4 people and a gourmet meal that will beat what you might find in your local Italian restaurant.  My family absolutely LOVES this mix.

review/summary: A real, authentic, and truly useful Italian cheese!
review/text: Fontinella is splendid. It is a very strong-flavored cheese, but therein lies its use and versatility. It can be eaten straight as an after-dinner course: let it come to room temperature, and serve it with (believe it or not) very strong coffee... the combination is exquisite (though perhaps not to every taste!).<br />  Moreover, Fontinella is a wonderful cheese to cook with. It can be grated and added to tomato sauce (for a really authentic Italian flavor!), to ravioli, manicotti, lasagne, and more. Chopped it adds a great flavor to a nice mixed antipasto (with olives, artichoke hearts, roasted peppers, onions, garlic, celery, parsley, eggplant caponata...); it tastes wonderful just grated over spaghetti like parmesan (let it get quite cold to facilitate the grating).<br />  This used to be available at the higher-end grocery stores; but lately it seems nowhere to be found locally. So it is wonderful to have it via Amazon marketplace! And worth the extra effort of buying mail-order.<br /><br />Buon appetito!

review/text: I asked for some of the deep fried peanuts for Christmas, and I am not overly impressed. I guess I expected them to be more candy like, but alas they are just as you would think. The shell is in fact deep fried to an edible consistency and the peanut brittle is by far the best of the 2 flavors I received. (Cajun are not so Cajun)Nice novelty snack that I would not buy on my own or ask for again.

review/summary: Maybe not my cup of coffee
review/text: UPDATE(7/9/12):  After experimenting with this coffee, I finally got it to brew properly.  I used one heaping scoop (or 1 heaping Tbsp) of ground coffee per cup (or 1 Tbsp for every 6oz).  I was initially doing 1 scoop for every 4 oz (what I usually do because I like strong coffee) but this coffee needed to be treated differently.  I now like Tim Hortons coffee :)<br /><br />I've actually never heard of Tim Horton's before, and I saw 5-stars from 24 reviews and thought "wow, this must be really great!  And such a cheap price!"  So I went ahead and bought it.  I don't necessarily like the flavor of the coffee, but that could mean 1 of 2 things:<br />1: I'm not brewing the coffee properly<br />2: I really just don't like this<br /><br />Now, this is not a review saying "Don't buy this coffee."  This is more of the review of me saying "Not my favorite cup of coffee."  I've become so accustomed to buying from a local roaster right down the street, I usually don't buy this kind of coffee.  But if you like this brand, the price is great!

review/text: This was my first time trying this coffee, and even though I like my coffee beans brewed a little bit darker, this is a good cup of coffee.<br />The coffee is reminiscent of old fashioned diner coffee.<br /><br />I think I'll try to roast these beans myself until they get just one shade darker, that may or may not work, I'll try it and see.<br /><br />Edit:  I roasted a half cup up one level of darkness, and although the coffee smelled better, I prefer the taste of the original roast.<br /><br />Still very good coffee both ways.

It tastes very similar to McDonald's Coffee, which is my favorite coffee to purchase pre-made outside of the home. As of this writing, it is out of stock and I sincerely hope it becomes available again. The closest Tim Horton's is about 1,200 miles from my house. That would be almost worth the trip to me, but not quite. I ordered the ground version and hope it comes out the same.

review/summary: PLEASE COME BACK, TIM!
review/text: I fell in love with Tim Horton's coffee on a trip in Canada. Tim has a very full flavor for a medium roast.  Good with fresh ADL half/half or good black.<br /><br />Tim is better than Dunkin's, Tully's House, and the Starbucks Blonde, and until he left us, Tim was much cheaper than all of the aforementioned.<br /><br />Tim Horton is so good that the rumor on PEI was that they put an extra addictive substance in it.  This is not true, but the point is that it is really good coffee.<br /><br />And for $12.88 for 2 pounds of beans (yes, beans!) shipped to my door in the Western U.S. for free (w/Amazon Prime)... I simply thought that we'd be together forever.<br /><br />As you can see, Tim has left us.  I'm rationing the beans in my cupboard and praying that maybe one day Tim will come back to us on Amazon so that we can all have a cuppa Tim's in the morning and forget for a brief moment that the day just started and enjoy the hot steamy cup of fresh ground Tim Horton's coffee.<br /><br />Tim, please come back to us... soon!!

review/summary: Not Gourmet, But Still Drinkable
review/text: First off, I am a little bit of a coffee snob.  I use a burr grinder and french press and don't add any cream or sugar.  I usually buy single-source coffee beans from a local guy that roasts them fresh in his house.  My girlfriend however, likes iced coffee with milk, sugar, and chocolate.  When she would come over and want coffee, I hated the feeling of using nice beans that would not be appreciated.  It felt like a waste.<br /><br />But... I didn't want to be rude and tell her that, and I didn't want to obviously use one bean for my coffee and one for hers.  This is exactly what I wanted.  It is an inexpensive coffee bean that makes good iced coffee, but that I can also enjoy black.  I disagree with some of the other reviewers because I would not want to drink this everyday.  It's not bad, it's just a decent, boring cup of coffee.  However, given the price, it was exactly what I was looking for and expecting.

review/text: I have tried many brands of coffee here on Amazon , some really good , some not so good and most were many more $$$ per pound. I have to honestly say I think this may be the best tasting coffee I have had in a long time. Great breakfast coffee, I would call it a medium roast,holds up well to cream and sugar. I am stocking up this time because this coffee is  often sold out.I think what makes this coffee so delicious is that it is really Really! freshly roasted. Try it, the price is certainly reasonable right now.

review/summary: Glad to find on Amazon
review/text: If you haven't tried this coffee before it has a smooth taste, nothing too distinct.  The coffee is a medium roast, certainly not a dark roast, but something you can easily drink every day (which many people do)...<br /><br />Unfortunately, Tim Horton's hasn't radiated to all parts of the US yet so if you're not lucky enough to have one close to you it is pretty tough to get any of their products without having family or friends bring it or ship it to you.  I am extremely happy to see that Tim Horton's is selling coffee/hot chocolate mix etc on Amazon.  So far, the prices are the same as what is stated on the Tim Horton's website.  I had only ever bought the ground coffee before so wasn't sure how the whole bean would compare but I find the flavor is pretty much the same.  I like that the whole beans will stay fresher for longer, and that I can grind them the way I want to.  Compared to other brands (where you might pay 2x as much or more for the same amount), the two pounds of whole beans is a really great value!

review/summary: Simply put....It's great tasting coffee!
review/text: The quality of Tim Hortons coffee beans is evident, as the unmistakable fresh aroma wafts from the bag to your nose. Kind of intoxicating really, in the sense that you just want to stand over the bag of beans and keep inhaling! Each time I grind and brew, these beans produce a rich, full-flavoured cup of coffee without the bitterness that some coffees offer. As to the value, this 2 lb. bag of beans at Amazon for $12.88 is very economical when you consider that another well known coffee house bean is being sold in 2.5 lb bags at my local warehouse club for $21.99. If you do the math, that's a significant cost increase for an additional .5 lb. of coffee beans! As a Canadian now residing in the states, I'm SO pleased that I can now get my Tim Hortons coffee delivered directly to my home(S&H free) without having to stock up when I go back to visit, or bother my family to send it. Thank you Amazon for allowing me my "taste of home" each day. As some of us would say back in Atlantic Canada, "Yes by, it's some good!" Enough said!

I was told on August 16 that they would have coffee in their warehouse on 8/17.  Today we still have no coffee.  How can a coffee company be out of coffee?  This is a recurring problem with Tim Horton and I'm getting really tired of it.  Perhaps you - Amazon - can do something to get them to fix this problem once and for all because they sure don't pay attention to their customers.  I'm surprised that you have any coffee left.  Usually when Tim Horton is out of coffee, so are you.

review/text: We lived in Canada for three years and it is the only coffee we drank while there. There was a Tim Horton's on every block. It's good coffee and once you get the taste for it you just want to always have it around. It became my every day blend. Then we moved to Texas where there is none to be found.<br />Needless to say when I discovered it here several months ago I jumped on it. We like to grind our own beans so I bought a 2lb bag. Then I went to order again just to find it was unavailable. Bummer we were out for a while. Then I saw the 12 1lb bag case become available so I decided to spring for the $83.00 and got the case of 12 1lb bags. That was pretty convenient. We just opened one and kept the rest in the spare refrigerator unopened. I did not wait to run out this time so I went to re-order the 1lb bags and found them unavailable.<br />Well look here now, its the 2lb bag again so I bought several of those. Bottom line. If your into the beans stock up and start looking to reorder before you run out.<br />Now all we need is the K cup version for the times I just want one more cup.

review/text: As with all Academia Barilla products, these tomatoes are a bit pricey. That being said, THESE TOMATOES ARE INCREDIBLE. They're sweet and fresh-tasting with no "canned tomato" aftertaste. They have an incredible flavor on their own, and unlike with cheaper tomatoes, you don't have to disguise unpleasant flavor tones with an excessive amount of spices.<br /><br />So while I think these tomatoes are too pricey for everyday use, I'd highly recommend them anytime you want to make a meal particularly special.

review/summary: An Earl Grey Tea for Earl Grey Tea Lovers!
review/text: *****<br />St. Dalfour's wonderful Certified Organic Earl Grey Tea is made from hand-picked, organic Ceylon tea. The flavor is enhanced by "the all natural flavor of bergamot orange", which added interest and made my tea experience delightful. The orange flavor was subtle, not overwhelming at all. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />Earl Grey teas are one of my favorite black teas, so if you are a fan also, this tea is one not to miss.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: Within seconds of immersing St. Dalfour's Earl Grey tea bag into steaming water, the enticing, aromatic blend of Ceylon tea and the all natural flavor of bergamot, a citrus fruit, wafts gently above your tea cup.  The uniquely pleasing taste of St. Dalfour's Earl Grey tea could be due to its 100% certified organic status - no chemicals or preservatives to interfere with its taste.  Each tea bag is hermetically sealed in a foil-wrapped container which retains its flavor until tea time.<br /><br />From St. Dalfour's site:<br />"Does it taste great and is it as healthful and nutritious as possible? These are the principles which are at the core of each line of St. Dalfour products. A simple philosophy. For simply fantastic food. The quality of our products depends on each ingredient, so we travel wherever necessary to source the finest raw materials. Products are released to market only after they have attained and surpassed the most rigorous standards. In this age of finding shortcuts and cutting costs, we remain guided by only one criterion: offering our consumers in over 90 countries worldwide the very finest all-natural products and ensuring that they are worthy of the St. Dalfour name."

review/summary: Very Good Popcorn
review/text: This yellow  popcorn comes in a useful airtight plastic canister that will keep your popcorn fresh and can be re-used to store grains, beans, tea, etc. With a four-pound supply, one canister should last a while. This popcorn pops very well on the stove. Here's how I do it:<br /><br />I recommend using a 5-quart stockpot/chili pot/dutch oven to make popcorn on the stove. You don't necessarily need high walls on the pot, but you do need some interior volume to accommodate the expansion of the popped kernels.<br /><br />1) Pour 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil into the pot.<br />2) Put three corn kernels into the oil and cover the pot.<br />3) Turn the heat on to medium-high. The interesting thing about making popcorn on the stove is that a medium-high heat works better than a low heat, because the kernels pop more quickly and thus have less time to burn.<br />4) Listen carefully to the pot -- the three kernels should pop within a couple of minutes. When the kernels have popped, remove them from the pot. Now sprinkle or grind some sea salt into the oil, and any other spices you may want to use (curry powder, turmeric, cumin, pepper, etc.) Spread the salt and/or spices around with a wooden spoon to incorporate them into the oil.<br />5) Pour 1/2 a cup or 3/4 of a cup of popcorn kernels into the pot. Use a spoon to move the kernels around and coat them thoroughly with oil. Cover the pot.<br />6) Now wait for the kernels to pop. Make sure the lid on the pot is tightly sealed. Every 30 seconds or so, grab the pot handles using oven mitts or potholders and lift the pot slightly off the flame, shaking the pot around in a vigorous circular motion and side-to-side. Put the pot back down on the flame. Shaking the pot helps to keep the kernels from burning and also ensures the kernels are receiving even heat distribution.<br />7) The kernels should begin to pop, slowly at first, then building up to a rapid crescendo. Continue shaking the pot every half-minute or so. When the kernel popping starts to die down, turn off the heat.<br />8) Remove the pot cover, and stand back for a minute. Sometimes, some kernels will still be popping, so just keep some distance.<br />9) Pour the popcorn into a large bowl and enjoy! Put any leftover popcorn into a zip-lock bag and seal it. It will last a few days.

review/summary: All-Around Excellent Popcorn!
review/text: This is good stuff!  Has a great taste and leaves very few, if any, unpopped kernels.<br /><br />The large opening of the container makes it easy to scoop out just the right amount.<br /><br />What a huge difference between this and microwave popcorn.<br />I would definitely recommend Snappy Popcorn!

review/text: This is better than the very cheap supermarket brands, But Orville Redenbacher popcorn is so much better. All the kernals do pop but the flavor is not there so I won't buy it again.

review/summary: snappy and happy
review/text: On a whim, I decided to order a 4 lbs. container of Snappy yellow popcorn.  I was getting rather tired of the typical one or two brands of popcorn at the grocery store.  They're over-priced and usually disappointing.  I was not disappointed when these wonder grains arrived at my door.  The product, once popped, is very pleasing.  It's light, crisp, and a pleasant taste.  It pops up well, all said.  I guess there is a kernel of truth in customer reviews, and this one is popping with satisfaction.  I know, it was a corny review.

review/summary: Stale
review/text: I received my order promptly and as promised yesterday.  My order included a hotair popcorn maker as well as a 4 pound container of Snappy Yellow Popcorn.  I was so excited when I received my order that I quickly opened the box and popped up my first big bowl of popcorn and boy was that a disappointment.  The new popcorn maker worked perfectly but the Snappy popcorn is stale.  I don't normally like to complain but the product was pretty bad.  On a good note, the popcorn pops up big, fluffy, and yellow.  If the popcorn wasn't stale it would probably be quite tasty.  There is no expiration date on the plastic container so I'm not sure if I possibly received a bad container. Perhaps if the container had plastic wrap around the lid or across the top under the lid it would keep the popcorn kernels fresh.  I haven't decided whether I should return the Snappy popcorn container or not but I wanted let others to know. Perhaps it is my fault because I didn't read the specific reviews to include the high and low ratings of this popcorn.  I just saw the overall rating of the popcorn was quite highly rated and highly recommended. My advice, read the reviews (good and bad).

review/summary: Seems stale
review/text: I should have been more careful about buying this. There is no expiration date on the package. The corn pops up nice and fluffy but is not tender and somewhat tough. Plus, there's so much of it that now I feel obligated to use it all up now that I've paid good $$ for it. Oh well; live and learn.

review/summary: Tough -- Not Fluffy
review/text: After reading the many positive reviews, I suspect that the 4 pounds I received is just too old (as a few other recent reviewers have experienced), but there is no way to tell how old it is as there is no "Best by" date on the container.  There is also no seal to maintain freshness other than the plastic lid.  Preparing the kernels stovetop and with a Nordic Ware microwave popper yielded the same results: small, not very fluffy and fairly tough popcorn.
