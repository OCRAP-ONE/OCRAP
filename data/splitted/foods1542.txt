review/summary: Disappointed after drinking Black Tiger!
review/text: I switched to Green Mountain Breakfast Blend after not being able to get Black Tiger as a super saver item.  It was a real disappointment.  Very weak and certainly not something I would want as "breakfast blend"..

review/summary: Must have gotten the "seconds"
review/text: I knew there was something wrong when I opened the outer packaging from Amazon an it contained loose coffee grounds.  I found the Breakfast Blend box to be leaking the grounds.  When I opened it I found several of the K-cups had lids that were applied off-center, thus not sealing the K-cups and the grounds were spilling out.  I have used LOTS of K-cups and have NEVER seen this before.  Poor quality control by Green Mountain with this batch.  Shame on the folks at Amazon for packaging up a box that was obviously leaking it's goods.

review/summary: Good Blend, but roast was too light.
review/text: I like the taste, but the light roast was too light for me.  I find myself brewing smaller cups of coffee, hoping for a stronger taste.  Next time, I'll go for a medium or dark roast.  I think it was the medium that I had before and I really liked it.

review/summary: Love Green Mountain Breakfast Blend -- Great Coffee!!!!!
review/text: I just recently got my Keurig, and I've been trying the sample pack of coffee that came with it.  So far this is by far my favorite.  I nice mild coffee taste to enjoy in the morning or anytime.  I actually wish they made this coffee in a decaf version also so I could enjoy the great flavor of this one anytime!  I think this will be the main coffee in this house; I've tried some of the others and liked some of them more than others, but this is the runaway favorite.  I tend to put a good bit of cream and sugar in my coffee (can't stand it black!) but the nice flavor of this one comes through the cream and sugar.  (I've found that cream and sugar can't cover up the taste of coffee I don't like!)  I don't care for the bolder coffees at all (I don't feel like getting slapped in the face by my coffee in the morning!)<br /><br />I'd encourage everyone to give this a try if you like a light roast coffee with a mild, pleasant taste in the morning -- you won't be disappointed!!!

review/summary: Terrible Price
review/text: I love this coffee and when I bought it, I also bought another brand. The price, around $20.00 was for two boxes of the other brand. I thought it was a pretty good deal although you can sometimes find it for $9.95 each at Target.  When they arrived, I discovered that I had paid for only one box of Breakfast Blend - a complete rip-off.  Even directly from Keurig, it's cheaper.  Will never buy this again.

review/summary: Do NOT buy from Mike's Grocers!!!
review/text: What I received today in shipment is a joke! I have the product on the desk in front of me. I see 4 packages of Green Mountain Coffee..Breakfast Blend. The 4 packages arrived NOT in an outer box! The packages are held together with yellow strapping tape. ALL 4 packages are ripped open in one way or another. One package has the bottom ripped off almost entirely and several coffee pods are missing. This disaster of shipping  was sitting out on my front porch in 95+ heat on a very humid Texas day. Mice, giant tree cockroaches, or kitties could have been prowling around inside the boxes. I can't believe UPS even accepted such a crappy packaging attempt. PLUS...I tried to find this Mike's Grocer online. The address on the return slip is 7 Prospect ST APT #4....an APARTMENT???? How do I even know where in the heck these pods originated? I LOVE Amazon and buy almost everything from them. This is my first REALLY horrible experience. Amazon....please get rid of this retailer!!!!!! Brenda Spurlin

My mother just purchased a 24 oz. bag from Sam's Club and we couldn't wait to try it.  We were amazed at how delicious they were. They were fresh, crispy and--best of all--low in salt, so that we could actually 'taste' the stone-ground corn.  We have tried dozens of other brands, and our search is now over.

review/text: I wasn't a big fan of tortilla chips -(unless I'd get them a Mexican restaurant, then I'd love them)- until I found On The Border Cafe Style Tortilla Chips at my local (warehouse club). These chips are not heavily salted, so you can actually taste the delicious and  subtle corn tortilla flavor, as well as the salsa (if you are using it). These chips are just the right texture (finer rather than coarse) and have a mild fresh flavor. These are my favorite, (other than those found in Mexican restaurants), and I recommend these highly!

review/summary: Fantastic chips!
review/text: I thought all corn chips were the same, until I had a bag from a certain Mexican-Irish restaurant chain. This eye-opening experience began my search for this taste from the grocery store.<br /><br />After trying everything on the shelf, I gave up. Suddenly, On The Border chips appeared at my Walmart store. These are the best store bought tortilla chips! I bought another bag, on my next grocery run, and they were still the same taste I was craving. The next week, they were gone.<br /><br />Walmart has just been contacted, and I am hopeful about their answer. If not, I will buy them somewhere else. No thanks A**z*n, this price is ridiculous.

review/text: After opening the box this item was basicly a 24oz bag of crumbs.  This is also not what I believed I was ordering.  Who the hell would pay 14 bucks for a 24oz bag of chips (I mean crumbs).  I believed I was ordering several bags of chips as it does mention there are 18 items.  Do not purchase this item.  It's a rip-off. I'll be contacting Amazon about this one.

review/text: These were the worst nacho chips I have ever had. The chips were two-sided with a thin hollow middle section between them that broke easily. They crumbled quickly when eating and had an unpleasant flavor. The cheapest store brand is better.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I've tried several of the Hansen's sodas and I like this one the best. The easiest way to describe it would be to say it taste like a lighter, refreshing, clear version of orange Sunkist. The flavor is very nice,though I taste more orange than any mango really. I don't usually drink a lot of soda but this doesn't have a lot of the additives (high-fructose corn syrup, caffeine..etc) so I can drink these without feeling too guilty. The price is pretty reasonable too for a 24 pack. I will be getting more.

review/summary: Very Light Taste with No Sugar Rush!
review/text: Although each can contains 44g of sugar, this soda does not cause tooth pangs nor taste overly sweet. There is a light, "clean" flavor to it as opposed to the more heavy, lab-created orange flavor of other sodas. The soda lacks any hint of mango flavor, but the orange flavor is nice without any medicinal sweetness to it. Unfortunately, some of the cans arrived with puffy tops and dents.

review/summary: wonderful tea--even with those stringless tea bags
review/text: This tea provides a luscious and refreshing break from your daily grind and helps you relax as well. It's got a great multi-berry taste to it that is very pleasant but yet not overpowering for a good cup of tea. Let it steep about three minutes and you're bound to enjoy it as much as I do!<br /><br />Each bag contains all-natural ingredients; and there are no artificial ingredients. The stringless tea bags can be removed from your cup whenever you want just by using a spoon or anything similar to get them out of the cup. Stir the tea bag around and up and down a bit while it's in your cup before you drink it.<br /><br />The tea is also caffeine free, which is a plus for those of us who don't want caffeine in our diets. That is something I always prefer.<br /><br />My only wish is that these teabags DID have strings; the stringless teabag allegedly reduces waste--but by how much? It's a very small difference which amounts to a marketing ploy; the stringless teabag means you must use a spoon or some other utensil to get the teabag out of the cup.<br /><br />If you like a wild berry flavored tea without caffeine or artificial ingredients, I highly recommend this tea! Enjoy!

review/summary: Berry medley!
review/text: Celestial Seasonings recent zinger line is much improved from the former hibiscus/rose hip dominated sour tea.  The flavor of this purple red brew was a nice wild berry medley. The mix of natural berry flavor reminded me of kool-aid--in a good way!<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box: "The road up and the road down is one and the same thing." Heraclitus.

review/summary: What is "Zinger?"
review/text: I bought this tea and I did not enjoy it. I like this brand a lot but for whatever reason the teas labeled as "Zinger" have a strange tart taste to them. They kind of taste like they have artificial sugar added to them. I have no idea what Zinger means and I couldn't find much information on it.<br /><br />I notice a big difference in flavor for the teas that don't say Zinger. I enjoyed the country peach passion and true blueberry from this brand. I would not recommend the Zinger teas.

Whenever I brew a hot cup of this tea, I feel transported to a better place and time. I taste freshly picked strawberries, blueberries and other varieties of berry.  It is especially good when infused with a spoonful of honey for good measure. It complements the tart quality.

I love Koolaid, but if I want Koolaid, I'll just use the regular kind, not this weird watered down version.<br /><br />In my opinion Raspberry Zinger is MUCH better than Wild berry.

review/text: I had bariatric surgery a couple of months ago, and have to drink lots and lots of liquid. One of the allowed beverages is decaffeinated tea.  I've never been much of a tea drinker, but thought I'd give this Wild Berry Zinger a try. I absolutely love it. It's berry-ish, but not overwhelmingly so. It's not quite sweet enough for me so I add one packet of Splenda to make it perfect.  I find it to be soothing and calming, if that's possible for a cup of tea, and drink 4 or 5 cups of it in the course of a day - even have a cup just before bedtime. I love the flavor, I love the feel, and I don't think anyone else should buy it... because then there wouldn't be enough for me.

review/text: So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the teas in the "zinger" series. I like Celestial Seasonings in general. Of course, the tea bags have no strings and that is something of an annoyance, but other than that, the teas are tasty and enjoyable. Zinger really is a great description of the product. It has a surprising and deeply flavorful taste and an aroma to match. The lemon has a fresh, rich lemon flavor. This one is an amazing medley of berry flavors. It might be my second favorite variety after the Red Zinger.  It is a great option for those who enjoy herbal teas.

I keep several packets of each type on the snack shelf in our pantry (in the place where I used to keep chips).  The single-serving packets are a good amount for an afternoon snack.  I also add them to breakfast cereals.

They have a nice long shelf life and you can control the calories and portions easily this way.<br />This would be a great thing to have on hand for emergency food supplies too.

review/text: My little girl had no problems eating fruit as a baby, but as soon as she entered toddler world she became very picky.  Fresh fruit texture just wasn't always to her liking and fruit leathers and other dried fruits were, in her opinion, too sticky.  In desperation, I looked for other choices and happened to come across these Sensible Foods crunch dried snacks.  I was a little skeptical, but I knew that if she didn't eat them I would.  Well, I rarely get the chance to indulge myself.  She loves these snacks!  We have tried two flavors so far, and I'm looking forward to trying the other two.  Her favorites are the apples, so she gets to enjoy some of those in every package.  I can feel confident that she is getting her fruit with no extra sugar.  Thanks, Sensible Foods!

The individual pieces are flavorful so you can nibble one tiny piece of banana and actually taste banana. There is no fat so you don't have greasy fingers.  You can take the packages anywhere.  Dried pineapples taste like pineapples.  Dried mango taste like mango. In some of the dried fruit mixes, the general taste is "blend." With Sensible Foods crunch dried snacks, you can savor the morsels slowly, one individual flavor and one individual texture at a time or eat them fast, mingling textures and tastes depending.<br /><br />I keep packages on hand to satisfy midnight snack urges,  to crunch instead of chips when I eat a sandwich, to snack while I watch the tube or to grab and go.  Tropical Blend is frankly delicious.  I buy regularly to always have some on hand.  It is much tastier, more interesting to the palate, and cleaner eating than nibbling on rice cakes, popcorn or chips. The product satisfies hunger, too, which makes it a close to perfect food in my world.

review/summary: Fantastic Sauces!!
review/text: I absolutely love Buckhead Gourmet sauces. It's very difficult to find a decent bottled sauce that isn't sweet or hot, but savory. The Buckhead Gourmet Bordeaux sauce is wonderfully savory. I've used it on chicken on the grill, roast venison, and many other things, all with wonderful results. It's great for a quick meal that people think you slaved over. For the chicken, I toss the chicken breasts into a bowl with the sauce. Tenderize the breasts a bit with a fork so the sauce can get into the breasts, also. Toss on the grill with a bit more sauce, and serve. For the venison, I simply browned the venison, added the sauce, and cooked until not quite med/rare. It was perfect and I served it with Christmas dinner.<br /><br />I've tried several of their sauces, and every one has been wonderful. My only complaint is that the sauces seem to be getting harder and harder to find.

review/text: This is the first Mighty Leaf tea I've tried, and I'm looking forward to trying to rest at my local cafe. Green Tea Tropical is delicious, and unlike  some other herbal teas, its fruit flavor is really pronounced. It's just sweet enough so that you don't need an added sweetener, but it's not nearly as sweet as juice. Mighty Leaf is expensive bagged tea, but it makes for a wonderful treat.

review/summary: intact leaves!
review/text: Love the packaging of this tea - the bags are biodegradable, have no flavor, and allow for the expansion of the leaves contained inside. Yes, you read right: this tea bag contains intact tea leaves, like loose leaf, not fannings like most major bagged teas. Dream! This is def. the tea I've been waiting for. I don't know how they package these things without breaking leaves, but it's the best tea bag packaging I've seen. I actually prefer other flavors they have opposed to this one, but most people I know adore the green leaf tropical. Good buy for 3 boxes.

review/summary: Good tea but pricey pouches, with enough for a cup, not pot!
review/text: Mighty Leaf have positioned themselves at the high end of the tea bag market, sorry, I mean tea 'pouch' market. They do deliver good teas, but firstly they are extremely expensive - its close to 50c per bag (!)and secondly some flavors have just enough tea in the bag for a single cup, not a one person pot. Ginger Twist is like that, try and make a small pot for one, and you'll end up with flavored water. So what? well any high end tea maker should be aiming for the small pot (a tea pot is essential for quality tea drinking!) and regardless if you agree with that or not, at these prices you simply should be getting enough to make a small pot for one, without using 2 bags.<br /><br />It doesn't apply to all their products, but is something to bear in mind if you want to protect your pocket-book, and favor the teapot over a bag floating in a mug of water.

review/text: I've tried so many different teas wanting to take the healthy approach but have been shoved right back to the coffee pot due to complete lack of flavor. Tea always seemed so boring. However, this tea is so yummy I am converted. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy coffee, but I now incorporate this tea almost daily. I love the Chamomile Citrus and Green tea Tropical!! The smell is divine and the tea bags are practically a work of art... LOVES IT!!

review/summary: Excellent tea blend
review/text: Overall the tea blends made by this company are excellent. I can't get enough! The tea is of high quality and the flavor is awesome. The tea is also loose leaf tea inside the tea bag. My only complaint is about the tea bag itself. Sometimes the entire string will become saturated with tea and acts as a siphon and siphons the tea in the mug onto my desk. I'll walk away and come back to find my desk covered in tea. I have to cut the string off with a pair of scissors everytime I make tea. So the tea bag needs some looking into, but the tea is just incredible!

review/text: I've been a tea drinker for almost a decade.  One thing I like about Mighty Leaf are the satin bags.  For this particular flavor I think its pretty good for a green tea, and not so bitter.  It seems as if I can taste a bit of apricot or a light citrus taste.  Its very good hot with a little sugar in the raw, but I'm sure honey would be great in it.

review/text: The first time I've tried the Tropical Green tea was at a small cafe inside one of my universities buildings nearly 10 years ago.<br />I'm still a fan to this day, and this is probably one of my all time favorite teas.<br /><br />This particular green tea has a hint of a sweet flavor brought on by pineapple, however it doesn't actually taste like pineapple. It has a very smooth and delicate flavor.<br /><br />Sometimes I drink it with a teaspoon of honey for extra sweetness. It also makes a wonderful cold beverage (brew hot, and let it cool naturally without adding ice)

review/summary: Green Tea, Hint of Fruity
review/text: I really enjoy this tea. I've had many green teas and this one is very pleasant. There are fruity, flowery undertones that are not too strong.<br />For those who gave this tea a low rating, it may be because they are steeping at the wrong temperature. Different teas need different steeping temperatures, and a too high temperature can make green tea bitter. Green tea should be steeped at 150-160F degrees for 2-4 minutes.

review/text: If I could give this 10 stars I would.  This tea is definitely the most delicious tea I've ever enjoyed. When serving it to non-tea drinkers, they get hooked. It's very fragrant and infused with tropical fruits. It's not sweet, it just smells and tastes great. Quite addicting. Downside is the price, but each bag lasts through two 12 oz refills of hot water, and it truly is worth every penny.

review/text: I found this tea in a local specialty shop and fell in love it. Unfortunately, they stopped carrying it and it has been difficult to find. The Green Tea Tropical is the only Green tea that I will drink. It is not sweet like "Tropical" would imply but has a nice subtle earth flavor. For me it is well worth the price. I have since tried other Mighty Leaf teas and they are truly flavorful.

review/summary: Tasty Tropical Treat
review/text: Although I love this tea, I don't buy it often because it is expensive for what you get. Amazon definitely has the best price on this tea that I've found. However, I will review the tea and not the price.<br /><br />The tea bags are each good for about 8oz of water, add any more water and the tea will taste weak. The tea bags are large enough to give the tea plenty of space and the tea leaves are large and not crushed. The tropical flavor is really strong. If you like sweet tea but want to cut the sugar down or out, this is an excellent tea to drink. It tastes sweet without any sweetener. The tropical flavors compliment the green tea and the outcome is delicious.<br /><br />If you are having a hard time cost-justifying this treat, go buy a tea in a coffee shop. It will likely cost you at least a dollar for one cup. If you buy this tea on amazon, you get a cup of tea for about fifty cents. That's still cheaper than a soda and much healthier.

review/text: This is the tea that got me completely hooked on Mighty Leaf Tea!!! The tea bags are so pretty and I love that the ingredients are natural. I drink at least two cups of this tea in the morning and usually another in the afternoon. I never liked the bitter taste of plain green teas that I had tried, and when I had Green Tea Tropical, I was totally addicted. The light tropical flavors are the perfect compliment to the green tea flavor. As with all Mighty Leaf teas, the flavor is so smooth and easy to drink. I have made so many friends try this tea, who either don't drink tea at all or hate green tea, and they've all become obsessed as well! LOVE this tea!!!

The combination of flavors enhances the green tea which I am usually not a big fan of, but with Green Tea Tropical I can get all the benefits of Green Tea with an enhanced flavor too! There is no wrong way to do this tea, I really enjoyed it iced, with and without creamer and the tea bags after wards were a very relaxing eye soother.

review/summary: Soft and fruity taste; tea for the tea-averse!
review/text: I used to HATE tea.  But Mighty Leaf is the first kind I tried and actually enjoyed (Chamomile Citrus, lightly steeped).  So decided to try a few other flavors, and now the tropical green tea is my favorite.<br /><br />This tropical green tea is very soft-tasting and fruity.  It's also the first tea that my husband actually likes too!  I do believe we've found a winner in our house.<br /><br />Tea lightweights that we are, we get about four cups of tea out of one pouch. I suggest brewing all at once, rather than a cup at a time. If you do it a cup at a time, the first cup will be VERY fruity, and the last one won't have much fruit at all.  We like it better evenly distributed among several cups.
