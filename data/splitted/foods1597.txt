review/summary: creamer
review/text: I should have paid attention to the posted reviews.  The flavor is excellent--I never tried it before.  However, before even tasting, I had to dump all containers in the sink to wash.  I pulled out all empty/leaking tubs.  There were 32 opened ones.  The shipping box was open and there was no shipping receipt enclosed.  Both boxes were saturated.  I'm sure UPS appreciated that.  PAY ATTENTION....DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT.  They are poorly packed and break open during shipping.

review/text: Love the Ameretto creamer.  Just can't find the large containers in the stores in my area.  They use to sell them but stopped.  Couldn't understand why since they were always sold out.  So I opted to buy the single serve packs.  Easier to store.  Miss the automatic shipments and must remind my wife to keep ordering when I get low.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: I really like this difficult to find flavor very much. It's my favorite International Delight creamer, sorry Hazelnut and French Vanilla.<br /><br />However International Delight's packaging leaves MUCH to be desired whether the 192 OR 288 count boxes. The factory boxes sometimes have air cushions packed inside the box  with the creamers, sometimes NOT. This inconsistency impacts (pun intended) the amount of sticky mess one has from busted creamers. Sometimes Amazon puts the box in their own box, sometimes they merely slap a label on the factory box. Then their endurance with the mail & delivery process is tested. Sometimes good (YIPPEE!) and others not so good :(<br /><br />It's been an interesting endeavor and a major surprise when everything arrives in perfect condition. I still cross my fingers each time I order with great anticipation BUT I STILL ORDER and call Customer Service when all is not well!

review/text: Bought this creamer because my mom likes taking them with her when she goes out to eat.  The only problem we had was the box was packed to full and some of the creamers broke open.  It said 288 were in the box and we have purchased these before and not had a problem.  I don't know if they were packed different or if more than normal were in the box.  All I can say is they made a mess.

To say we were disappointed is putting it mildly.  The seals were not put on correctly, the result, a mess!!  Not only more than a 1/3 leaked but the ones that didn't leak, were hard to open.  I called International Delight and they did not back their product because we bought it through Amazon.  Could Amazon do something about this seal problem?

review/summary: Great product and no broken cups!
review/text: I was a little apprehensive about ordering these, cuz one reviewer had some problems with damage from shipping. They said that amazon sent them another shipment though, and only 10 cups were broken that time. I figured for the price and with the fact that I can't find these cups in stores and only at a restaurant, I could handle a small loss. They showed up in perfect condition, no breakage or leaking! Even better, I got these today (April 26th 2010), and the outside of the box shows they don't expire until October of this year. By then I'll be due another shipment if I continue the subscribe and save anyway. I feel I got a great value, and will just have to see how much of this I use. Even if they do expire in October, if I have a few dozen left that wouldn't stop me from using them.<br /><br />I have to say too, I REALLY like the subscribe and save feature. I hope Amazon continues with it and adds some more products too. You have to know your prices for things to determine which things are worth it, but it's also great for those hard-to-find items like this one. :)

review/text: For years, for all of my waffles and pancakes, I bought this in specialty stores until even they stopped selling it in deference to Classic Fare Belgian Waffle Mix, which, to me, has no flavor.  When I finally found this, I pounced but hated having to buy so much.  But at least I now have it.  Certainly keeps me from having to continue to make my own.  Took a bit more than a week to come because the snowstorm slowed or stopped all commerce.  I do recommend the product because I really like it.

review/summary: Do I Need to Explain...
review/text: ... that without Swedish pancakes, life is scarcely worth living? When I fix breakfast, I make pancakes from scratch, but I always make sure to have a box or two of Lund's Mix in the pantry in case my wife or a visitor has the urge to cook. Lund's Mix needs a half-teaspoon or more of cardamon, and of course these pancakes must be served with lingon. I use a special Swedish "flat-pan" to make perfectly round pancakes, but that's just a picky extravagance; an ordinary iron griddle will do fine. I've found that the mix doesn't fry well at altitudes above 8000 feet; I don't know why. Otherwise the results are plenty good, and this is a bargain price for twelve boxes.

review/text: "Dave's Insanity Sauce" is top shelf when it comes to hot sauces.  This is for people who really like their mouth to catch on fire and for their chili to melt the pot.<br /><br />This collection has four sauces; the original "Insanity Sauce", which was once the hottest sauce available on the market, made directly from capsaicin extract, clocks in at a healthy 180,000 Scoville units, the "Temporary Insanity Sauce" which is as hot as the original, but doesn't linger on the tongue, the "Total Insanity Sauce" is a garlicky version of the "Insanity Sauce", and finally the "Ultimate Insanity Sauce", which gives you a mind-numbing 250,000 Scoville units.<br /><br />Compare these to the average 2,500-5,000 Scoville units for your standard bottle of Tabasco sauce, and you can start to get the picture.  These are some true hot, hot sauces.  The "Ultimate Insanity Sauce" should get ladled out by the toothpick-full rather than poured directly into a dish.<br /><br />This is a great set for the price, and you aren't going to run out any time soon.  One bottle of any of these sauces will keep your mouth on fire for several years due to the small amounts used for each dish.  It is an awesome set, and one that I highly recommend.

review/summary: FYI for those wanting to try it
review/text: I used to live in Atlanta, Georgia.  The air temperature in Atlanta yesterday was around 100 degrees F.  The temperature of the surface of the sun is around 10,000 degrees F.  We know that the surface of the sun is around 100 times hotter than the air temperature in Atlanta yesterday.<br /><br />Tobasco sauce is around 2,500 Scoville units.  Dave's Ultimate Insanity Sauce registers a blistering 250,000 Scoville units.  From this we can see that Dave's Ultimate Insanity Sauce is about 100 times hotter than Tobasco sauce.<br /><br />Therefore, the difference between the the temperature of the air in Atlanta and the temperature of the surface of the is roughly the same as the difference between the heat of Tobasco sauce and the heat of Dave's Ultimate Insanity sauce.<br /><br />When friends of mine want to try this sauce, I first let them know the above information.  Telling them that the sauce is really hot isn't sufficient.  It's impossible to describe the feeling when this sauce hits your tongue for the first time.  But, if after I tell them the facts and they still want to try it at least I can say they are making an education decision.<br /><br />This sauce is absolutely incredible and this the 4th time I've ordered this sauce.  Also, it's worth video taping someone the first time they try it.

My main reason for not giving this five stars is because it's a little too sweet, not intensely gingery enough for an avid ginger eater.  It is affordable though, so that's a big plus.  And yes, ginger is great for migraines, nausea, indigestion.  Still looking for the five-star choice!

review/text: This is a very good value.  I buy a lot of ginger and this brand was pretty good.  It would be better if it weren't covered in so much sugar but it is the typical amount found on any crystallized ginger.  I didn't find as many fiberous pieces in this product compared to other brands.

review/summary: So-so
review/text: I got this ginger because of te price - but it is not my favorite.  I think that it would be great if you wanted more of a sweet candy, because that is what it is.  I have had 2 other brands of candied ginger before and they both tasted more like - well - Ginger.  This brand is so sweet and I don't feel like it is helping as well with my stomach ailment.  So, overall, if you're wanting more of a sweet candy with a hint of Ginger, it'd be great, but if you're wanting Ginger for the Ginger flavor and digestive issues - I'd recommend trying a different brand.

review/summary: Klein's Naturals Ginger Slices, 10-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 6)
review/text: These are really good, and a good price--I snack on them throughout the day.  The only problem I have with them is that they contain a preservative, and I believe that the purer the edible is the better for a person's well being.  I have also ordered another company's ginger slices through Amazon.  They taste the same but do not contain any preservatives. They do cost a bit more, but I feel it's worth it not to have any additives.  I appreciate having somewhere where I can purchase this item without it being tremendously expensive or full of added chemicals or both--if I have to go to a local store that's usually what I have to deal with.

review/summary: Ginger is fine, container is not
review/text: I have been enjoying ginger for years, but do not consider myself a gourmand. That said, I enjoy the flavor of this ginger.<br /><br />My issue is the packaging.<br /><br />The material the tubs are made with is bad. Brittle, thin, weak. When I got the box with these in it, half needed new containers immediately (one of these was thrown away upon further inspection as being too compromised). And the rest, I didn't trust to just leave on a shelf and stay together.<br /><br />I got this in Feb. 2011, hopefully this has improved since. Oh yes, I am still eating the ginger I put into better containers. So no complaints with it lasting if it's in better storage conditions.

review/text: The basil and sun-dried tomato pesto are excellent.  The artichoke paste is a thick paste, very mild in flavor but still very tasty.  The olive paste is a little salty and strong, but so are the black olives from which it is made.  All of these taste very good and are excellent condiments to use on veggies and eggs as well as pasta.  My only complaint is that there is a little too much olive oil in each jar - I had put them on a slanted shelf in my refrigerator, and a lot of the oil leaked out (even when the tops were tightly screwed on).  Needless to say, I had a mess to clean up but learned that olive oil is excellent for dry skin!  I would definitely buy these again.  This is a good sampler.

review/summary: Great for work
review/text: It's so hard to find healthy noodle bowls-- and the Annie Chun's Noodle Express line does a great job of providing good flavor without scary nutrition information. Each tray is a little over 300 calories, compared to 500+ for a traditional ramen-type meal of the same size. I keep these at work in case I don't have time to make my lunch, and don't feel guilty at all when I eat them. Not everybody needs to watch nutritional information, but for those of us that do, it's a really convenient product.<br /><br />The sauce & seasoning packet are about what I would normally expect from a comparable product, but the steamed noodles really make this a great change from the rest.

review/summary: Good non fried alternative
review/text: These noodles are very flavorful and convenient considering they are vacuum sealed. They are very easy to prepare as well in your microwave. The best part though, is that these noodles are NOT fried like traditional ramen noodles are. They are steamed, and thus much easier to digest and also much healthier and lower in fat. According to annie chun's customer service, none of their product's noodles are fried. I have stomach problems and this is great for me.<br /><br />Remember that this is just the noodles and sauce, and a little garnish packet of vegetables. If you want a more complete meal, add some protein like chicken, tofu, etc. The fresh pak noodles are very versatile and can be used any way you like. I've only seen one other steamed ramen soup alternative and it was just awful. Thank you annie chun!!!

review/summary: I am Hooked on the Annie Chun Foods
review/text: (B000E123N2) et.alles.  I really am hooked on this product line, despite reading other reviews that say thus-and-such doesn't taste like the restaurant versions.  I don't get out much, so I will never have that experience to spoil my own enjoyment.  I also read a complaint about the noodles.  Well, they are vacuum sealed, and depending on the noodle, might retain their natural noodle aroma, but that is all.  Anything else said is bunkum.<br />I would suggest that the packets of dehydrated spices, and blocks of goodies that comes with Tom Yum, for instance, be heated in a minimal amount of water first, and then covered with the noodles.  This will allow the spices to rehydrate in the best way possible, and makes the product tastier.<br />These are not inexpensive; once you find the ones you like, order them through 'Subscribe and Save' for the extra savings.  You can stagger their delivery so you get one a month.<br />And by all means, ENJOY !

review/summary: Annie Chun does noodles right
review/text: The flavoring still needs work, but man oh man are the noodles themselves good.  I'd love a little more of something besides the soy sauce.  However they are super fast and the noodles are FANTASTIC, so I will probably keep eating them and hoping someone gets around to tweaking the flavoring.  Also hopefully lowers the sodium a bit because while I LOVE sodium packed/bad for me items (I can honestly eat 2 packs of Ramen noodles without an issue), but in this item it alters the taste for me.  I'm guessing if you're someone that packs on the soy sauce (I use a reduced sodium on a regular basis), this won't bother you at all.

review/text: They must have changed this product since previous reviewers said it was good:  I just tried it for the first time and it was HORRIBLE!  After following package directions, had to add some water and re-microwave to soften up the noodles, which were FAR from ready to eat--the sauce packet is not enough to moisten them sufficiently.  And then, it tasted terrible.  What a disappointment.  I have been eating Maruchan for quite awhile--not great--but WAY better than this!

review/text: How badly can someone mess up teriyaki flavoring? This noodle bowl is the least edible thing I've ever tasted. I'd compare the taste to Vegemite/Marmite and those Halloween blood capsules, and the smell to a burnt capacitor. After one bite I went outside to throw it out, I didn't want it stinking up my indoor garbage can. I have never been compelled to call a 'satisfaction guaranteed' hotline, but if Annie Chun's had one I'd be on the phone right now. After this disaster I nuked a Annie Chun's Spicy Szechuan which was a huge improvement, actually edible.

review/text: As I enjoy grilling, a friend gave me a sampler pack of assorted Jacobs rubs before we left the U.S. to move to New Zealand. Not being familiar with their line, like an oaf I left them unopened for about six months, and then one day thought "what the heck" and tried them.  While the others were definitely good, this one stood out SO much that when ever friends come to visit from the U.S. I send them a six-pack of this Road Kill Grill to bring over for me.  This stuff is just fantastic on steak, and will make you look like a rock star griller.  Don't be fooled by the humorous name -- this is a seriously good rub.  Highly recommended!!!

review/summary: Good Cat Grass
review/text: I use this in a small Sylvester/Tweety chia pet cat grass container, with a backup as well so when one is dieing out I can start the other one because it takes about 5 days to sprout and mature grass before putting it down for consumption.<br /><br />First time only used two teaspoons of seeds in small 3 1/2" dia soil opening in container, and the next month used 3 tsp which has produced the grass density desired.  I use orange bagged Miracle Gro fast-draining soil for Cactus and add 1/4cup of water, cover opening with plastic wrap over a clear plastic glass to allow room for sprouts to grow, put in a warm dark place for 2-3 days then set it in the sun for 2-3 days misting often with water.  I follow up with misting a few more days so all the surface seeds stay wet and continue to sprout watering once a week with 1/4c water thereafter.  In the winter to sprout seeds, I put it in a small cardboard box, cover that with a dark plastic waste basket and sit it in the sun, putting another light colored woven basket over the dark plastic basket when necesary so it doesn't get HOT.  In the summer, it goes in the dark warm attic.

review/summary: Puppy is indifferent
review/text: I thought my puppy would love this, but she seems to be indifferent to it.  It is nice and heavy and has lots of different textures for chewing.  If she did chew on it, I wouldn't be worried about pieces getting stuck in her throat or anything like that.  She's just more into other toys right now.

review/summary: Puppy Loves It But Doesn't Last
review/text: We have a 4 month old german shepherd puppy who LOVES to chew on his star... unfortunately the star doesn't hold up very well. He's completely chewed off all five points. They say the toy isn't edible but if it's that easily eaten, maybe they should either consider making it edible or make it more durable. Thought the nylabone products would last but I guess it's time to start looking for other products that he won't destroy in one sitting...

review/text: Bought this for a friends Bulldog that is a serious chewer.  I won't go into the details here, but lets just say some furniture has been distressed by her.  Anyway this little star is her all time favorite chew.  She carries it from room to room.  It has kept her chewing away from things not meant to be dog chews.  Good product.  Holds up to a Bulldogs strong jaw.

review/summary: getting tired of toys not lasting when promised...
review/text: It would be nice if someone could make a toy out of some material that would actually LAST!  This one sure doesn't.  My TOY australian shepherd has nawed about 15% of the tips off within an hour or so.  She's not even 12 lb's and is getting through it.  She does go through any toy so far pretty quickly.<br />I'm better off just giving frozen carrots and maybe buying some rawhides soon, but i don't think rawhides are very healthy and wanted to stay away from them.<br />I have two other small dogs who don't seem to chew toys to bad, but its hard to tell because the aussie is always around and is more than likely the culprit.  The only reason i give it 2 stars is that at least the dogs all like it.<br /><br />to review:  $10 toy that could possibly last my dog at least 10 hours and then she'll poop it out and possibly get harmed that way. Or $1 bag of carrots that are healthy and freeze them so they chew a little longer.  hmmmmmmm.

review/summary: Awesome and LASTS
review/text: My Golden Retriever puppy got this toy when I first got her and loves it. She has chewed and chewed on it for about 9 months before it's finally ready to be thrown away. It seems to have lasted WAY longer than most toys (if it's soft it lasts about two days with her, if that and if it's a hard toy it's usually a week). When there were several toys around she would always go get "the star." Careful towards the end of it's life when the plastic has been gnawed pretty good because, in my case at least, your dog will start puling off chunks of it and chewing it. Sometimes she swallowed bits of it; it never hurt her or anything but that's when I took it away and decided to get a new one.

My lab starts to drool when he sees one. My shihvanese practically does back flips! Everyone loves greenies. I like how they leave my dogs' breath sweet smelling and teeth clean. Easily digestible, senior formulas with joint help, great on their digestive system, just a great, great product! Can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />I will say though...if your dog is a gulper, please make sure you watch them while they eat/chew. They seem to like it so much that you really need to be on hand just in case, as is true with any chewy product for your furkids!

review/text: My reaction was "wow!" the first time I gave these to my 8 year old lab.  His teeth were extremely dirty with what seemed like plaque or whatever it was on his teeth that I could not get rid of by brushing his teeth.  I thought I would need the vet to professionally clean his teeth.  I was amazed as to how his teeth became pearly white after a few of these greenies not to mention that his breath did not have a nasty smell either.  I give these to my 2 year old pup as well.  Her teeth have never been as dirty as my 8 year old's but at least her breath is fresher too.<br /><br />5 STARS ALL THE WAY!

review/summary: Go away bad doggy breath!
review/text: My dogs don't have terribly stinky breath and I have Greenies to thank for it. I've tried the knock-off products and to be honest they don't seem as well made, plus  my dogs actually seem less excited about them.<br /><br />I ended up buying the large Greenies (pkg of 8) for two reasons. One, the price-point seemed right and two, I have two dogs (60+ lb catahoula leopard dog and a 10 lb terrier mix) and its easy to break the large Greenie into two portions for them. One packages last us about 1 month (1-2 Greenies / week).<br /><br />Our dogs really do love these things. If we present them with the option of a Greenie versus some other treat (say a bone) they invariably take the Greenie.

review/summary: deadly
review/text: 1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous and Deadly, May 25, 2006<br /><br />I have two beagles who love to chew, and greenies are highly compressed which woule make it a good optionfor my dogs. However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse.<br /><br />If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a "busy ball". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy balls let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety.<br /><br />If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie.<br /><br />Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly.<br /><br />While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies.<br /><br />I am actually surprised amazon even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to amazon users to petition them to stop selling it.

review/summary: Lemonhead lovers, this is for you!
review/text: I wasn't really sure of this tea, Lemon Matcha. I ordered it for my wife in the hopes that it would be her gateway matcha drug, but she really doesn't like matcha, so it will likely be a bust (though she'll be a good sport and try it anyway). But I'm only a citrus fan to a point, that point usually being grapefruit. Mmm, grapefruit.<br /><br />When I first started mixing it, it smelled like a mix between Lemonheads and lemon cleaner. But the sip is pure lemonhead. It tingles down my tongue! It's tasty in its own way, and if you're into Lemonheads and the like, I would definitely recommend this to you. My wife has a coworker who loves lemon, so this matcha might be hers after another cup or two. It has a lemony bite that someone who enjoys lemons and sour candy might love. It's more of a mild vegetal flavor than a stronger matcha, which my wife appreciates in a matcha. The lemony bite can be cut with a touch of sugar, so while I can see that this matcha would be right up the alley of a lemonhead lover, it's just not the tea for me. I am extremely grateful to have tried it, though!

Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away.

There is a distinct foul odor when you open the bag for the first time.  After airing the bag out, the first piece I tasted was like chewing shoe leather, dry and chewy without much flavor.  After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.

review/summary: Great snack....even during battle!!
review/text: I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!
