review/summary: Dental chews
review/text: Have been using these for 6 of the 8 years we have had our goldens and their teeth seem to have stayed in unusually good condition. Very little buildup, and only one cleaning in 8 years between the two - just a warning they do not smell good at all- we refer to them as stinkin bones, but they work so well!

review/summary: Pretty good chews
review/text: I've been using these for 3 years for my golden doodle Karma.  They help keep his teeth clean and he chews them up readily.  I had been getting them at the vet for about 50% more than these go for so figured I'd start paying less for them.

review/summary: The dogs love them, I love them!
review/text: I have an English Mastiff and a Rottweiler.  My mastiff was having some seriously nasty breath so I bought these to see if they would help.  My dogs are fairly picky when it comes to bones, etc.  They both enjoy these chews tho.  I give each of them 1 per day and within 3 or 4 days their breath has dramatically improved.  I have not had any problems with the dogs choking on them thankfully.

review/summary: Wonderful product
review/text: Having seen these chews advertised many times, I had to give them a try, finally.  I was very pleased with the results that my 18 month old Aussie has had with the chews.  She loves the taste and smell of them (I don't mind the smell either), and I love even more that they don't leave stains on my furniture like typical rawhide chews do.  I did not give 5 stars only because they can be choking hazards if your dog is not supervised when eating these.  But as long as your mindful of watching your dog while they enjoy these treats, I have nothing bad to say!  It's a great preventative to bad breath and bad teeth!

review/summary: Does the job
review/text: The chews really seem to do the job.  My Lab mix  will turn his nose up to the typical rawhide chew.  He really likes and looks forward to getting his C.E.T. HEXtra chews.  He can hardly wait once he hears the bag.  His breath isn't bad at all. Even though he was a rescue dog his teeth were in pretty good shape.  The vet from the rescue gave him a clean bill of health.  Too soon to take him to my vet for a check-up.  I will know in a few months what my vet thinks.  But just looking at his teeth for an 8 year old dog they look pretty darn good.  The only down side is the sizes of the chews are not consistant.  Some are big and thick some small and very thin.  I purchased the large dog chews and many were just bite size.  This next bag is for X-tra large dogs hopefully it will have more unformed sized chews.

review/text: My golden retriever absolutely love these.  In fact, he actually begs for them each morning.  If he thinks he can get one of these, he will spit out his mild bone for them.  He knows where they are kept and will stand by the cabinet hoping he gets one.  We don't give them to him when he is not supervised because he has a habit of wanting to swallow them too soon.  His teeth are completely white!

review/summary: CET pet Chewies... and the "Company"
review/text: I would never retract that the product seems to be excellent for our pet... and she really enjoys them.  I guess my now somewhat jaded view of the firm itself is from the fact that we did purchase a bag that was indeed problematic for our dog.  After incurring over $1,300 in vet bills to discover that base cause was that new bag of Virbac Chewies... Our contact with Virbac was friendly from a customer service standpoint... but the net result was not one dollar of help toward the .. for us... rather substantial vet bill. It seemed to be a management attitude of .... "there is no way our product could have had anything to do with the spewing diarhea.... so just go away"<br />Needless to say... we will find an alternative to Virbac in the future...<br /><br />It's really a shame... because before that bag and since... there has been no problem.  However.... as a small business owner... I cannot support a firm that has such a black and white attitude toward such matters.

review/summary: Healthy chew to keep your dog busy!
review/text: I bought both the CET HEXtra premium oral hygiene chews and CET Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews to switch off so my dog doesnt get tired of chewing the same thing over and over. I have a 13 pound Chug (pug chihuahua mix) and I buy the large then cut them into 2 or 3 long pieces. At first I gave her the Enzymatic chew which lasted her a whole day or even two which is good because she usually goes threw chew treats within an hour. Then I gave her the HEXtra chew to try and she loves this one. I cant even get within 2 feet of her before she starts growling then she just runs away with it lol. I find that most of the chews for the HEXtra are much thinner and easier to cut with basic scissors. After she had a taste of the HEXtra she slowly steers away from the Enzymatic each time we give her one. After 2 weeks whenever we give her the Enzymatic she just licks it a couple times and then walk away. For the HEXtra she still goes crazy over them! She goes through all the tricks I taught her without saying the commands lol. I dont know what the big health difference between the HEXtra and Enzymatic but if I had to recommend one I would suggest getting the HEXtra. Hands down your dog will love it. Like anyone has mention well with any kind of chew treats remember to take it away when it gets small or it can be a chocking hazard.

review/summary: Excellent and good for teeth
review/text: My 12-year old lab-ish dog usually has to have her teeth cleaned annually, under general anaesthesia. We started buying these in medium size about 8 months ago. She eats about 3 per week. She will take in in her paws, lick and chew it away for about an hour. (We offer her one every day, but sometimes she doesn't feel like eating it, sniffs it and walks away). At her checkup 2 months ago, our veterinarian said her teeth are in excellent condition and recommended waiting until her next check-up in 6 months to reassess the need for teeth cleaning.

review/text: When at the vets, my yellow lab pup Cooper was given a chew for a treat. He loved it, so I ordered a bag of them for him and his 7yr old Lab/German shorthair sister Tehya. When at her yearly checkup, the vet checked Tehya's teeth and gums and exclaimed "Good job". I have done nothing but give her and her brother a chew every day or two. I have my daughter giving her dog the chews as well. "Good job" Virbac!!

review/text: My dog loves these "chews" but they're more like snacks to her.  She's a 37 lb mini-labradoodle and while these do a nice job freshening her breath and removing some tartar, they're so thin that she manages to eat one in less than 10 mins.  I wish they were  a little thicker or tougher so that she'd get more of the teeth cleaning benefit that chewing provides.

My Lab likes the large size and it takes about 5 minutes, but my King Charles Spaniel takes about 15 minutes to chew a medium. Their teeth are also pretty clean, but I do brush them about once a week, so I am not sure if it is from the chews. Enjoy!!

review/text: These bones really freshen the breath and clean the teeth.  My dog was a rescue whose teeth were beyond gross.  After having them professionally cleaned, he still had terrible breath.  After giving these on a regular basis - his breath is much more pleasant.  I usually buy these from my Vet at a greater expense.  Glad to find these online for less money, more convenient, and don't have to wait for a Vet appt to get them.  I bought 3 more bags since this order.

review/text: I've been giving one of these a day to my dog for the past 2 months. She previously had a bit of tartar build-up on her back teeth despite a very healthy diet and daily compressed rawhide bones. Before, my vet recommended a yearly teeth cleaning (which I'm too paranoid about to go through with!). But the last time my dog and I went to the vet, the vet was really impressed with how clean my dog's teeth were -- almost all the plaque is gone! Yay! It's fantastic to be able to do something that's SO quick and SO easy and prevents your pet from having to undergo anesthesia and a pricey $600+ dental cleaning procedure! Plus, my dog loves these chews.

review/text: Our Black Lab has been eating these since we got her 4 years ago.  They are a dental hygiene product and very effective.  Labs would eat all day long given the opportunity so her HEXtra Chew in the morning after breakfast and a plain C.E.T. Chew at noon helps to keep her appetite satisfied without adding many calories.  Helps satisfy her chewing instincts, too, although she has learned to chew them pretty fast.  One hint is not to give them toward the end of the day as our dog occasionally used to barf them in the night.  Great product!

Recently, she spent a few days with a dog sitter who didn't know about this particular brand... after seeing our dogs reaction she went online and purchased some for her two dogs.  I highly recommend these as safe and easily digestible treats that provide a good work-out for your dog and help keep their teeth clean and fresh smelling at the same time!

review/summary: Delicious, but still unhealthy.
review/text: It is a cut above your usual Poptart- It does not contain high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, artificial colors or flavors, or any other additives. It even has organic ingredients and some whole wheat content! HOWEVER, I would not make these any more than an occasional treat. It does still contain 18 grams of sugar, and most of it is NOT from fruit. There is also only 1 gram of fiber, and only 3 grams of protein. It wouldn't hurt for the whole wheat content to be bumped up a little, and it wouldn't even be noticeable if white whole wheat flour was used, or some other healthy flour. The current combination will put your blood sugar on a roller coaster. It also has a lack of added vitamins, which is one of the only good points of other Poptarts.<br />As for the taste, it is pretty intense. You can really taste the strawberry!  It's nice and slightly chewy, although not annoying, rubbery or tough. It sort of reminds me of a soft sugar cookie in terms of texture. Try it yo'self, and see what you think- It's still healthier than your average Poptart.

review/summary: I'm On The Better-Than-Pop-Tarts Side
review/text: Yeah, I know, it's a matter of taste.  But really, do we want so many things so awfully sweet?<br /><br />There are a lot of flavors out there besides "sweet," you know.<br /><br />These pastries aren't as sweet as Pop Tarts, very true.  I find (and I'm talking unfrosted) that I prefer tasting the strawberry stuff and the pastry stuff rather than the sugar stuff. This is a concept that takes some getting used too; but it's really not all that difficult.<br /><br />Not that these Nature's Path goodies aren't sweet; but they aren't as sweet, so sweet your mouth feels like it wants to go immediately to the dentist after you eat one.<br /><br />Shall we mention that these just may be better for you?  Well, I'm no nutritionist, so let's leave that part to the scientists in the crowd.

review/summary: Awesome!  Better than Pop Tarts!
review/text: I stopped eating pop-tarts because of all the junk that was in them (hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, etc).<br /><br />I tried these and - wow!  They are actually better tasting than pop-tarts.  They still have the rich buttery crust, but their filling is actual fruit, and tastes incredible.<br /><br />These look exactly the same as pop-tarts, right down to the foil wrapper and little grooves on the back of the pastry.  They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors.<br /><br />This doesn't make them completely "healthy" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome.

review/summary: Great product- not great Amazon fulfillment
review/text: These toaster pastries are great.  They taste just like pop tarts, but are organic so I can feel slightly less guilty about feeding this stuff to my kids.<br /><br />The order fulfillment is not great assuming this is a personal order and not a buisness. Toaster pastries, like most processed foods, have a very long shelf life. The order I got in the mail was an entire case of toaster pastries with an enjoy by date ONE month away. A case of toaster pastries set to expire in a month... Not so useful for a family with just 2 kids.

Doesn't need frosting because it is just sweet enough.<br />The only downside is that the packaging is two to each foil wrap. At 200 calories each, that is 400 calories. Fine if that is all you are going to eat for breakfast but a bit high if you want anything else as well.<br /><br />I'd like to see them individually wrapped instead. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.<br />They taste really good though.

I shop at Costco a lot and have been disappointed that they only carry the Frosted variety of toaster pastries. I refuse to pay the grocery store prices for a treat like this so, for years, I've done without. Both Strawberry and Blueberry are good but I find the Blueberry to have more fruit flavor than the Strawberry. Either way, if you're like me you'll enjoy this product and, the Amazon Subscribe & Save price is quite reasonable too!

review/summary: All broken up
review/text: I have ordered chips from Amazon before and they have come no more broken up than what you would buy at the grocery store -- specifically, the Bearitos blue corn chips.  They came double boxed with outer box being particularly strong.<br /><br />This time, these Mexi-Snax Sesame chips were sent in the original manufacturer's box and were really smashed.  I called Amazon, and said it must be the single box vs. double box that got them all smashed.  Amazon graciously and quickly sent me a new case of the chips, double boxed as requested.  They were smashed up even more!  I finally figured it out:  these chips were packaged like they were "vacuum-sealed"... there was absolutely almost no air in the bags, and that's why they crushed easily.  (The Bearitos chips had plenty of air in the bag, allowing for shifting during shipping, which is why they arrived in almost perfect condition.)<br /><br />I called Amazon again, thanked them for sending the chips double boxed, but told them they were more crushed than ever, and I felt it was a manufacturer's packaging problem and the apparent "vacuum-sealing" of the product.  They quickly refunded my money.<br /><br />So while I was not pleased with the Mexi-Snax chips, I was extremely satisfied with Amazon's customer service representatives and their handling of the situation.

review/summary: Imulsion is no joke!
review/text: As a fan of Gears of War and energy drinks, I had to try this one. After I opened it and poured it into a glass, I knew I wasn't ready for it. I might as well have cracked open a glowstick and poured that into a glass, because that's about the color and consistency of this drink.<br /><br />Kudos to whoever made this beverage, because it really does look like "imulsion" from the Gears of War game, but there's a difference between textures on a screen and something I'm about to ingest in my physical body. My first thought when pouring it was literally, "oh, that can't be healthy." My point is, damn... this stuff is green.<br /><br />All that would of been fine had it taste okay, but it tastes like it looks. Seriously, if you took the insides of a glowstick, added carbonation and taurine, I'm pretty sure it would taste like this. I enjoy most energy drinks, but to finish this, I had to add some potent adult potables to the glass.<br /><br />If you're a huge Gears fan, or if you're sadistic, go ahead and buy one.

review/text: So I was looking around the internet for reviews on this and I noticed there really are none.  This drink is not a necessary need for a Gears of War fan, but it is funny to have.  Imulsion, in Gears of War, is alternative fuel that gives humans a horrible lung disease and turns Locust into horrible mutated monsters.  That, and the fact that no nutritional information or taste-reviews for this product lead me to believe that anyone who has tried it has died.  Cheers!

review/summary: A Fantastic Roast that's Earth Friendly
review/text: I was looking for a dark roast that was also organic. Amazon happened to have a great special on this coffee. I was not disappointed at all and have bought this product again, after the special expired. It's a quality coffee with a rich taste. As a bonus, it's grown the "right" way through organic/biodynamic methods. If you care about environmentally-friendly farming and/or supporting small farms, this is a product you should consider.<br /><br />I use these beans with a burr grinder and a French press. The beans are very oily, as French roast ought to be. They are packaged well, but I highly recommend placing them in an airtight container after you open the bag.<br /><br />The taste is phenomenal. If you like bold and dark coffees, this French roast is the way to go. The taste is very strong, but acidic. Cafe Altura also has other beans available if you're looking for a lighter roast. Overall, this is the best coffee I've purchased from Amazon. If the company has another two-for-one special, I'm going to order a ton a Cafe Altura beans!

It is rich and smooth, but somewhat mellow in personality.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong...I'm going to enjoy every cup of these beans as my Capresso gently grinds the beans just before brewing. I have the machine set to grind at largest/coarsest setting. It is a conical burr grinder...so it is not burning the beans as it grinds. I don't think I could improve the process used to experience this coffee.<br /><br />Would definitely re-order...but will also try other styles from Cafe Altura to inject some variety.

review/summary: Very fresh and tasty! Very Bold but balanced.
review/text: I am generally a Seattle's Best coffee fan, but this competes well and is a bargain compared to some higher priced brands. The first bag impressed me with really oily fresh beans. The smell was somewhat off-putting when opening the bag for the first sniff. However the first batch through my French press was delicious! Upon sharing this with a few colleagues at work, the opinions were favorable. We like our coffee dark & strong with no acidity. Cafe Altura French roast is a winner and will also produce a fine espresso or a stout iced coffee. Okay- this is an update to the above: Upon trying an espresso grind, the coffee is still tasty but the oily beans finally killed my cheap burr grinder! If you are going to have freshly roasted, dark roasted, oily beans coffee, then use an inexpensive chopper-grinder or invest in a commercial grade, conical burr grinder. This is good coffee, but tuff on cheap grinders!

Using a french press, I enjoyed a cup and was pleased with the aroma and flavor which was strong, tangy, a hint of sweetness and not bitter.  Overall, this is a very good french roast, especially considering the price.  I had been enjoying a Nicaraguan Organic French Roast for the last few months costing approximately the same price per pound, and Cafe Altura is clearly a better prepared coffee.

review/summary: High Quality Full Bodied Coffee
review/text: This is the only coffee I have bought for the last year. It doesn't seem to have high acidity and the taste is full bodied without over roasting the beans the way some others do (to mask that they are using low quality coffee beans). When the beans are over roasted the coffee tastes too strong, burned, and bitter. This makes an excellent high quality cup of coffee everytime. Make sure you are using purified water so that you do not introduce chemical tastes from tap water and to use the right size of grind for your method of making coffee. I use the pour over cone filter method. Enjoy!

review/summary: An Update:  Great Coffee
review/text: I purchased this to get a good french roast at an affordable price.  The biodynamic, organic preparation was a plus.  When I open the package, I get a wonderful aroma, and it promises a fabulous, smoky cup of coffee.  Unfortunately, I don't get the depth of flavor that the aroma promises.  In addition to the less-than-satisfying flavor, I find that it has a bitter after-taste. The strength and smokiness are there, but the flavor is not well-rounded.  I've ordered this one time, and when the bag is gone I doubt that I will revisit it.<br /><br />Update:  I wrote the above review prematurely.  I discovered that when I use less grounds, I get a wonderful cup of coffee with wonderful smoky roast flavor.  It is just what I was looking for, and I have reordered.

review/text: While I don't completely understand the "biodynamic" part of the coffee, what I do know is that it presses into an exquisite espresso. The flavor is rich and complex while staying smooth and not overly bitter. My husband likes a nice Americano with enough water to nearly negate the beverage being coffee. Cafe Altura holds its flavor even under such adverse conditions. The only down side is that my body has usually had enough coffee long before I want to quit drinking it. Having it show up on my doorstep when I'm down to the half cup of beans is so perfect. Subscribe and Save rocks.

review/summary: mmm...
review/text: Without a doubt, this is the smoothest whole bean coffee I've ever tasted. I don't know what biodynamic means, but it's delicious!<br /><br />For a French roast, it's not that bold. I use a Mr Coffee grinder (which I've reviewed in the past) and a Melitta single-serving drip cone. It's a basic setup. But everyone who's tried it RAVES about it. Even the cream&sugar crowd can drink this black. This is the perfect coffee to get non-coffee drinkers hooked. It tastes almost as good as it smells.<br /><br />The beans have an oily sheen. I don't know if that's some sort of edible sealant to keep the volatile flavor oils from wafting away, or if the beans are so full of flavor it's exuding from the surface. Either way, this is a winner.<br /><br />I haven't subscribed yet because I'd like to try the other Cafe Altura products before I commit to just one, but this  one's certainly at the top of my list. I've ordered this one 4x already.<br /><br />I've noticed this thing has gotten pricier since the first time I bought it. I got two 32oz bags the first time appeared on Amazon. That's okay though. It's still cheaper than Trader Joe's and definitely tastier.

I emailed Cafe Altura and Cindy from their offices confirmed that it is not decaf (which I suspected after a cup of this wonderful roast). She stated it is "just a description of our different processing methods". In fact she says that Amazon does not sell any of their decaf products at all. Hopefully this will end the debate as to whether their Amazon blends are decaf or not.

review/text: UPDATE: I must have gotten a bad bag the first time around. I just got another bag and opened it today. The beans were aromatic, fresh, and oily. The coffee was perfect this time around using the same amount of beans as last time. The coffee was nice and bold. It was not watered down and weak. My coffee snob husband even loved it. I ordered another bag right away. I am hoping to get another good bag. :)<br /><br />For the price, this organic coffee is good. We pay about $9.99 for half pound for higher quality for local coffee shoppe beans. Overall the flavor was full-bodied, but it tasted watered down. We used the proper amount of beans, ground them fresh right before brewing, and just didn't didn't get the zing I expected. It did have a nice aroma and finish though. the acidity was well-balanced. I might try extra beans next time. I would definitely purchase this again and maybe mix this with our regular coffee to stretch it.

This coffee may be much better than cheap non-organic coffee but not close to a lot of organic coffee brands I have tried in the past. First, it's very weak, I like my coffee strong but if I make it too strong, the taste is horrible. When I make it "just right", I find it weak and not very flavorful but my American friends find it delicious. I am from Europe, I like my coffee robust and flavorful.

review/text: This coffee looked like a good deal and had some good reviews but dont be deceived!  I think this particular bag of coffee I got had to have sat in the warehouse for at least a year.  The beans, when ground, go to dust instantly. When I added the hot water to it (I use a french press), the water became very foamy - I have never seen beans do this before with hot water added to this extent. (talking 4-5 inches of foam above the water)<br /><br />Finally, the coffee taste itself is old.  Stale, old and if it hasnt been sitting in a warehouse for over a year then the company doesnt know how to cure it's own beans.  Move on, as it's not a "deal" when you cant drink the stuff.

She sent me a couple ounces to try and I too thought it was great, maybe the best coffee I have ever tried.  I drink coffee but am by no means a gourmet and I don't buy expensive coffees for my self.  I purchased another order (a couple weeks ago) as a gift for my housemate.  I can't believe its the same coffee.  It tastes like the Folgers or Maxwell House I buy at my local grocery.  It has a bitter aftertaste.  I'll be the first to admit I don't know anything about fancy coffee; but when we opened the package the beans looked wet with oil.  We transferred the beans to other containers and the inside of the package was lined with beans stuck on by the oil.  The beans weren't dripping oil but almost.  Is this right for fancy coffee?  Needless to say I am disappointed.

review/text: I had tried the Columbian Dark by the same roaster and it was acceptable (Not Great).  Thought this might be better after reading all the positive reviews.  IT IS NOT!  It's almost undrinkable. Bitter/acrid aftertaste that lingers on the tongue long after drinking, and an acid stomach to go with it. I suspect this roast appeals to those who like Charbucks coffee which is almost invariably burned and harsh on the palette.<br /><br />I do like the organic aspect, but in this case that is not nearly enough to redeem this lousy coffee. I am going to give this company one more try and order the Sumatran dark. Keeping my fingers crossed. I've learned not to trust the Amazon coffee reviews very much, but I suspect I'm a lot more finicky with coffee than the average reviewer.

review/text: Yes, I am a coffee snob. But this is only because I have discovered that I very much enjoy the differences gained from the effort and the investments of time and money...it works so much better if one uses the consistent grind of coffee that can be achieved with a conical burr grinder (my purchase of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001804CLY">Hario MSS-1B Mini Mill Slim Coffee Grinder</a> was a crucial step towards coffee nirvana) versus the mixture of chunks and powder that comes out of a cheap electric blade grinder; the kind of smooth, rich, full-bodied nonacidic brew that comes from steeping evenly and quickly, like a real espresso machine can achieve or that I've been experiencing with the far less fussy and amazingly engineered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a>, completely surpasses drip or French press; and the beans matter. In fact, it is really all about the beans. And they have to be fresh, for starters.<br /><br />This crap -- and I do mean crap! -- is anything but fresh.<br /><br />It tastes to me like the batch I received recently was roasted two years ago and sat on some shelf in a warehouse the whole time. No thanks!<br /><br />How do I know this? By taste, of course. And there is no "best by" date on this package to refute my claim.<br /><br />Since purchasing the Hario grinder and the Aerobie press, in July of this year, I enjoyed two other very good French roasts from "Just Coffee," purchased at my local cooperative grocery (yes, organic), and one purchased here, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001KL1YI">Volcano Dark Roast, Organic Kona Hawaiian Coffee, 8 Oz, Whole Bean</a>. Every last cup brewed from these was heaven. During that time, I periodically washed the Hario grinder to remove the coffee oil buildup whenever I would begin to detect the effects of rancidity, and before trying this batch from Altura, I washed it again. So I know that everything necessary for a great cup of coffee was in place and ready to go.<br /><br />Except the beans this time were the deal breaker. A brew using freshly ground coffee beans stored in vacuum canisters should not taste bitter. The first cup was reminiscent of gutter water. I will not be falling for this again.<br /><br />To Amazon's credit and with my deepest gratitude, customer service responded to my feedback. But in all honesty, I believe this product should be removed from sale here.
