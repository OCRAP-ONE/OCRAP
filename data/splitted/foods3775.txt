review/summary: Breaks Apart
review/text: This is my dog's FAVORITE flavor of the Blue Buffalo biscuits. The only reason I gave this review 4 stars is because the bars were all broken up when I received them. I guess this is because of shipment but I will likely just buy biscuits in a store from now on to avoid so many broken pieces.

review/summary: Great treats at a super price!
review/text: I got these treats because they're one of the healthier treats on the market, and my dogs LOVE them! The pumpkin is good for their digestion, and apparently tastes delicious. Blue Buffalo has several flavors of these treats, and my dogs love them all. They all have good ingredients that I can pronounce, and no filler or "junk". I definitely recommend these to anyone who wants something healthy to treat their dog with. :)

review/text: when I picked up my new puppy in December I brought a bag of Blue Buffalo Health Bars (apples and yougart flavored) to share with the grandma, mom, dad, and siblings.  needless to say I came home empty handed in the doggie treats department but 9 dogs and pups where happy : )  Since then I have bought two other flavors and this one (pumpkin and cinnamon) is my puppy's favorite!<br /><br />Great ingredients at a reasonable price with flavors your dog will love.  Have shared with neighborhood dogs and have yet to see a dog (over 2 dozen) do anything but enjoy these health bars.

review/text: Got these treats for my dog for Christmas. She is a 3 year old Griffonshire(Brussels Griffon/Yorkie Mix). I love the fact that Blue Buffalo only makes Healthy Treats for your pets. They don't fill them up with stuff that isn't good for your pet like by-products and preservatives. I only feed high quality foods and treats to my dog and these certainly meet those requirements. I would also highly recommended Blue Buffalo Tranquility treats!

review/summary: Good, if yoiu can get them intact...
review/text: I received my order and was very disappointed in the shipping for 2 reasons.<br /><br />1) The box was nearly falling apart with the end tape half broken and the cardboard ripped open and crushed. I was able to reach my arm into a hole in the corner of the box as it was delivered.<br /><br />2) A 30 lbs. food bag had been shipped with the health bars with only a paper wad as protection.  I opened the health bar bags to find that all of the bars were broken into crumbs.  This is simply unacceptable regardless if the shipping is free.  I have placed orders like this before and never had a problem as the items were automatically shipped separately and arrived it boxes that were intact.  Now I am seriously considering not ordering these items again.

review/summary: Chocolate heaven
review/text: Well well, here's another matcha that took my tastebuds by surprise. I ordered the Belgium Chocolate matcha expecting, well, I didn't know what to expect! Haha.<br />I've never had a chocolate flavoured green tea before, but for some reason I didn't even blink or flinch at the thought of a chocolate matcha. It must be the faith in flavour that Red Leaf has instilled in me - if cotton candy works, why not chocolate, right?<br /><br />There were a few more reasons I sprung for the chocolate - I had also ordered the strawberry and knew they would make an amazing pair! (Chocolate covered strawberry matcha, how sexy!), but I also have caramel and cheesecake matchas which it would also blend well with! Let's not forget a chocolate covered banana iced latte (might add a little bit of english toffee in there as well for a Skor effect!)<br /><br />What can I say? I feel like a matcha mad scientist. I've got a blending itch that I have to scratch!<br />What took me by surprise was just how chocolaty the smell and flavour was! The cocoa powder used in the blend must be of quality, because it is leagues better than the no-name powder in my cupboard. It's silky and rich and has the quality of drinking chocolate. When I'm drinking it straight, I'm tempted to throw in a dash of cinnamon and cayenne for a Mexican hot chocolate flavour. Or maybe experiment on the savoury side with a matcha mole sauce - I would definitely be feeling like a mad scientist with that one, but hey why not! If the Food Network did something like that no one would bat an eye ;)<br /><br />So far my favourite way to enjoy this matcha is as a hot latte with all the fixings! I whisk up 1.5 teaspoons of matcha with just enough water (175 F) to make a paste. I then add about a half of cup of water (same temp) and sweetener (white sugar for me) and whisk some more to dissolve the sugar. A simple syrup would also work! Now I heat up � cup milk and cream (half and half) in the microwave and froth it up with my milk frother. Add the half and half to your matcha, top with whipped cream and chocolate shavings! This treat is oh so comforting, and could even be recreated with soy/almond milk or 1% for a light but indulgent treat!<br /><br />Before this matcha I hadn't found a flavoured tea of ANY kind that was a "replacement" for treats. Yes, I am in love with the cheesecake matcha - but it doesn't replace my cravings for a big fatty piece of creamy thick cheesecake. Nor does a chocolate cake tea turn me away from the frozen McCains delight sitting in my freezer. This tea, however, DOES cure my craving for chocolate and hot chocolate! Sometimes I get a real hankering for a package of powdered hot "chocolate" - but I don't even consider this a "substitute" - it's the real thing!

review/summary: Renew my faith in Matcha
review/text: I should mention that my first experience with matcha was not a positive one. We had bought a pouch of matcha from a tea store that shall not be named, and my fiance spent some time looking around on the internet figuring out exactly how much matcha to use for a cup of tea. Needless to say, it didn't go terribly well. I took one sip, looked at her, and said "Are you serious, you actually want to drink this?". Except it also involved swearing.<br /><br />I put my interest in matcha on a back burner at that point. Maybe it was something a future, more refined me would enjoy, but definitely not today.<br /><br />Then, Red Leaf Tea started showing up and making a huge effort to bring in new customers from Steepster. Reviews started popping up about their fantastic matcha, and the awesome flavors that they have. When the Belgium Chocolate Matcha went on sale, I knew it was time to give matcha another try. I figured, if I can't enjoy half-priced, chocolate flavored matcha from what appears to be the best matcha vendor around, there was probably no hope.<br /><br />For preparing this, my fiance used her battery-powered frother, as opposed to the traditional matcha tools. It may be bucking convention, but it really seems to create a nice, smooth evenly distributed cup of matcha. This resulted in a smooth, but murky jade green drink, which is significantly darker than the matcha-that-shall-not-be-named. This makes it obvious that there is true cocoa powder in here, as opposed to just a flavoring (unless there was a flavoring and a coloring, then all bets are off).<br /><br />It definitely smells very chocolatey, very sweet without any sugar added. It reminds me of a chocolate cake batter, or possibly muffin batter. There's the chocolately sweetness to it, but the hint of background... well, I suppose it's the smell of the matcha itself. Anyway, the matcha smell in the background elevates it a little bit to a baked-good smell, at least for me.<br /><br />The taste is very smooth. At first, it has a warm hot cocoa flavor to it, absolutely delicious. It is inviting, and comforting, with a subtle sweetness on your tongue (much more subtle in taste than in smell). To me, the first drink was overwhelmingly cocoa flavored, with no vegetal taste to betray the matcha lurking below. Each successive drink makes that matcha flavor come out a little bit more. There is a strangely beneficial aspect to this, and that is that the matcha flavor itself slowly builds on you. It's very crisp and clean, lightly foresty but without that swampy, seaweed taste that some green tea comes with.<br /><br />As you get to the end of the drink, there is some matcha that has settled towards the bottom. This is likely because I'm a little bit of a slow drinker, sensitive to hot liquids and such. Or, we really have no clue what we're doing. Always a possibility.<br /><br />All in all, I would definitely recommend this matcha, especially if you're new to the world of matcha. It has renewed my faith in matcha as a viable beverage choice.<br /><br />You can also get this from Red Leaf Tea's website, with a staggering number of different options.

I usually order my matcha from Matcha Source out of LA and I guess I have been spoiled because the quality of this green tea seems low and combined with the "chocolate" flavor is undrinkable to me.  I will be using the rest of the bag in smoothies and hope it will drown out this awful taste.

review/summary: Matcha + Cocoa = Heaven
review/text: If you've ever had drinking chocolate, you know it can be a bit much to handle. Drinking this tea is like having matcha combined with drinking chocolate. It has cocoa powder added, so it has that bittersweet chocolate flavor without the additional sweetening and flavor ruining of your usual hot chocolate. Oh, and of course, it's matcha, so it's far better for you. The only complaint? Well of course, it's not extremely chocolatey but sadly I think I am always going to be stuck in the camp of things never having enough chocolate. Still, it's delicious.

review/text: I've been using these bags for lunches for about 2 years now, and love them.  I don't trust the chemicals that may lurk in the plastic ziplock bags, since the scare of bpa, and so turned to these.  They are great for sandwiches, snacks, etc.  With wet food however, the seal on the bottom may break after awhile.  I still put strawberries in there, and they still do fine for awhile, but at the end of the day....the bag seal might come undone.<br /><br />They are also biodegradable, and that makes me feel better, compared to the zillions of ziplock and plastic lunchbags that litter the Earth....

review/summary: Best vegetarian gravy in mix
review/text: I have been searching for a mix for vegetarian gravy with a beef type flavor.  This is the best I have found.  The mock chicken version by Hain is not to my liking so if you have tried that one don't let it prevent you from enjoying the brown gravy mix.  Whole Foods used to carry in bulk mix for chicken broth/gravy that was very good but seems to have discontinued it.  The only vegetarian gravy better than this brown gravy mix comes with a tofurkey that is mushroom gravy that is prepared and frozen.  This is simple and handy and relatively inexpensive and as tasty as any meat based gravy mix.

review/text: I bought this as a substitute to the gravy mix I did use (bought at Sams Club) that had monsodium glutenage (?) in it...I used it spread on top of roast when cooked in a dutch oven.  The Hain Pure Foods Vegetarian Brown Gravy Mix was a good substitute...I recommend it.

review/summary: Best Deal EVER
review/text: This product is a useful and tasty alternative to making my own gravy from scratch. Sometimes I just want to eat some potatoes with gravy but I don't have all the ingredients to make gravy, or the time.<br /><br />Aside from pairing this gravy with potatoes, I love to make vegetarian SOS.<br />Here is what I do:<br />-Sourdough toast<br />-Veggie burger chopped up and sauteed or Veggie Crumbles, sauteed<br />-Gravy<br /><br />My other variation for this gravy is for a faux Stroganoff.<br />- Egg Noodles<br />- Veggie steak or Veggie Crumbles Sauteed with diced mushrooms in olive oil or butter<br />- Gravy<br />- Top with a dollop of cream cheese, vegetarian "sour cream," or vegetarian greek yogurt.<br /><br />I bought this product as a warehouse deal, and I almost feel guilty for paying such a low price. At Whole Foods, these are more than twice the cost here at Amazon.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Good gravy
review/text: Hain's brown gravy is the perfect storm of accomplishments you don't normally associate with vegetarian food.  It tastes like the real thing; it's easy to make; it's inexpensive (~$1 a pack); and it's relatively easy to find: my local grocer carries it  -  but if yours doesn't, it's also lightweight and easy to ship.<br /><br />"Savory" and "hearty" are two of the harder-to-come-by tastes in the vegetarian palette, and there's nothing to remedy that dearth like a big bowl of mashed potatoes and gravy.  Plus, it's satisfyingly gloppy.  Few vegetarian foods promise such delightful slop and unhealth.  (The gravy is in truth disappointingly healthy, but you can pretend.)<br /><br />(Hain's chicken gravy is acceptable but not as successful, though, so watch it.)

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: You need to understand that I haven't had gravy in nearly 20 years.  Up until that point, mashed potatoes & gravy were my singular most favoritest thing in the world.  Twenty years.<br /><br />I found this stuff while browsing at Whole Foods, went home and made it up, and O.M.G.  The clouds parted, the sun shone, and God himself smiled down upon me and granted me the most miraculous vegetarian gift I'd been given in a very long time.<br /><br />I returned to Whole Foods the next day and bought five more packets.

review/text: We had some Fiesta Lemon Pepper that was salt free and we loved it.  Can't find it here in Tulsa.  Saw this at Amazon and ordered some right away. Well, this stuff is NOT salt free.  There are no ingredients listed in the product information when we ordered it.  Not only does it have salt, but it also has MSG! Tried to return the stuff, but "not elligible" for return.  Will probably end up throwing it away. I wouldn't even give it as a gift with MSG.

review/summary: Amazing aroma, even better flavor
review/text: I have a huge palate for curry dishes, from Chicken Tikka Masala (India) to Katsu Kare (Japan) to Kang Panang (Thailand). This one is more of your traditional curry taste, where the majority of flavor is coming from the cumin spices in it, but it tastes so savory and flavorful! When you first open the bag the intensely fresh aroma just hits you, and your room starts to smell like you've been cooking for hours. I use this curry powder as an alternative spice for a lot of my home-cooked meals. Its healthy and a little goes a long way for adding flavor.<br /><br />One pound is a lot of spice. It comes in an aluminum sealed bag but it is not resealable. Make sure you have a proper container ready prior to your purchase if you want to maintain its freshness. For me, I use those wide-mouth Ball mason jars and a Foodsaver vacuum sealer to pump out the air. It took about 2 of those pint-size jars to seal most of it. The rest I put in empty spice jars for the spice rack for quick use.<br /><br />Oh for those interested, I found the ingredient list on the Frontier's website. Everything is organic, which would entail no loss of flavor from commercial sanitizing processes. Per their description it is:<br />Organic coriander, organic turmeric, organic mustard, organic cumin, organic fenugreek, organic paprika, organic cayenne, organic cardamom, organic nutmeg, organic cinnamon, organic cloves.<br /><br />I for one like to make curries, but they also have some suggested uses for their curry powder as a flavor add-on:<br />* Add to meat and vegetable stews.<br />- Use to flavor steamed or saut&eacute;ed vegetables.<br />* Use to flavor stir-fries.<br />* Rub in or sprinkle on chicken, lamb or seafood before grilling or broiling.<br />- Add to rice or any grain dish.<br />- Use in raitas or dipping sauces.<br />* Add to meatloaf or bean or nut loaf recipes, hamburgers or veggie burgers.<br />- Add to potato and pasta salads.<br />- Use to create marinades for fish, meat, poultry, seafood, and tofu.<br />- Stir a pinch or two of Curry Powder into your tuna or tofu salad.<br /><br />The ones with asterisks are the ones I've tried (or experimented) and recommend personally. And guessing from my family's reaction, I think they would recommend it too =)

review/summary: Amazing best spice in the world made right here in the USA
review/text: This is not your little shipment-stale curry powder from India nor locally made Swad company's innocuous curry powder. This is work of art. A little of it goes a long way. It is highly aromatic and intense. I am obsessed with this spice. I just made  a simple dinner for a diabetic friend of mine. He was in tears when he said this was just awesome sauteed fish (buffalo fish fillet with lovely innards and silverfish) and vegetables (string beans and cauliflorets) he ever had. Little sea salt and this curry powder were all I needed to get a rave review like that. Another friend also commented when I made sauteed potatoes with this dry rub: ''What is this wicked thing you made? This is totally aphrodisiac.'' If your kids do not eat veggies, just dry rub this a little bit with sea salt and olive oil, and see what they say. My kid hates potatoes with a gusto but when it is made with this curry powder, he'd say: ''I do not know what to say.I hate potatoes but this is awesome.'' I always keep it handy wherever I go. My local organic market does not have it all the time (My Organic Market). They said it is the most sold item. Its base of organic turmeric powder is a panacea for all kinds of stomach ailment, so it is good to make this part of your diet.

review/summary: No bad taste, and seem to provide energy
review/text: My herbal doctor recommended wheatgrass for energy, detoxification, and stress reduction.  That sounds like a lot of benefits.  I was eager to try it out.<br /><br />I take two of these pills in the morning and two at lunch, along with some organic spirulina I bought here on Amazon.  Together, I do notice a little boost of energy - helping me awaken in the morning pre-coffee, and helping perk me up after lunch.<br /><br />I will purchase another bottle of each supplement and continue, since I feel it is working.<br /><br />Note: if you like the powder form, you can use that - Amazing Grass makes some of that too.  Or if you have a masticating juicer (like an Omega), you can juice wheatgrass.  Personally, I find pill form easiest to sustainably take each day - and like with many supplements, if you don't take them regularly, they won't work as well.

If I can't make the mix product then these tablets are quick and easy.  You have to take each one quickly because if you let them hang around in your mouth for even a few seconds you'll begin to get the flavor, which isn't bad but I prefer to get them down ASAP.  I do not find the tablets to be too large.

review/summary: It stopped pollen allergy
review/text: I have been purchasing a lot of stuffs from amazon but never left any reviews, this is the one I have to say it is amazing!  It stopped (or cured?) my husband's pollen allergy. He used to take all kinds of allergy pills trying to stop sneezing, watery eyes and runny nose, but no medicine could attack all the symptoms. For 5,6 years, He had to take many different kinds of medicine... And this year, his symptom got worse. We got the info about how wheatgrass can stop allergy and boost energy, so he started taking 10 tablets a day, before he finished the first bottle, his pollen allergy's gone! His brother and mom who also suffered from pollen allergy for many years, took wheatgrass as well(they drank juice), they are pollen allergy-free now! I gave half bottle to one of my neighbors and her allergy stopped too! Having said that,  it doesn't stop my husband's seafood allergy. Originally we were just thinking instead of buying medicine, why not spend the money on natural remedies? It wont mess up you body like medicines, and If it doesn't work we will just go back to medicine... But it worked! If you are suffering from pollen allergy, I strongly suggest you try wheatgrass!(any brand organic or grow by yourselves but not the ones you buy at juice stand cause they've been harvest hundred times and had no nutrition at all!)

review/text: Account holders wife here.  This stuff is great!  Its not restraunt quality but then you're not in a restraunt!  It is fast, easy and the taste is fine.  I've used at least ten bags and never had any problems with the taste being off.  It's really good mixed in with some refried beans and meat and rolled up in a soft tortilla.  I was diappointed Amazon doesn't have any now and hope they will restock it.

review/text: I was really excited about this, because I like the Minute Rice cups, and this is cheaper.  When I took it out of the microwave, I noticed a strong plastic odor coming from the bag, but it seemed to dissipate when I poured the rice into the bowl, so I went ahead and took a bite.  YUCK.  The stuff really does taste like the awful plastic smell that came from the bag.  Glad I only bought one bag, 'cause I won't be using it again!

review/text: What can I say? This is Bazooka gum! It's just like you remember it (except now, Cherry has been replaced by Tropical Punch, and Strawberry has been added to the mix...) (Also, there is no grape anymore. :(  )<br /><br />Original still tastes just like it did when I was a kid, and the comics are as corny as ever. (In a good way.)<br /><br />The 1440 pieces of gum (!!!) that come in this case are a value-buyers dream. I bought this for the office to aid in our "stop smoking" campaign, and it worked pretty well. The 1440 pieces of gum lasted about 2 months for some 30 employees.<br /><br />My only piece of advice: buy this gum in the fall, winter, or early spring because the gum will soften when it ships in the hot summer sun, and will tend to stick to the wrapper when one is trying to unwrap a piece. :)<br /><br />Oh well... live and learn, I guess. :)

While it doesn't taste very mango (if you don't know it's mango you probably wouldn't immediately guess), it is fruity.  It has a a great taste.  The flavor bursts. Mango isn't as good as melon (ooooooh melon is so good), but they are individually wrapped little golden rounds of fruity gummy goodness.

Going to need to put a lot of honey in it, and play around with amounts and brewing time. The flavor is good, if a bit "puckerful."<br /><br />Update April 2, 2012: The secret is to limit the brewing time. THREE MINUTES seems to be the magic number. For a gallon of iced tea I am using a "3, 3, 3" rule - 1/3 rounded cup tea, 1/3 cup honey, 3 minutes brew time. Comes out great. But no matter what, don't let it brew too long, or you will be sorry.

review/text: Have you ever just approached a vending machine and realized that everything inside of it isn't worthy of your hard earned dollar? Sunflower seeds? Please. Cheese Doodles?! Get a life.<br /><br />THEN!......there were Oreo Cakesters. Not only will you buy them every single time you are within 50 feet of such a vending machine, you will become irritated and Hulk-like when certain machines do not carry them. In rare cases, people have been known to resort to cannibalism in order to fuel their Cakester hunger.<br /><br />I'm sure you'd like to know details about the Cakester's composition, its preferred habitat, and its breeding habits, and I promise I will leave no stone unturned.<br /><br />To put it simply, I have never met a real life person that does not enjoy Oreo Cakesters. Do not be fooled by the posers posting reviews about this lovely product. They are spies sent by Keebler to take down the competition. I wouldn't trust those elves. Would YOU?....<br /><br />Now, you may be wondering about the texture of this bite sized dyno-mite snack. Well, I assure you they are made from only the finest ingredients from only the most elegant factories across the planet. If you treat your Cakesters with love and respect, and keep them in proper temperatures, I promise you will be pleased with the outcome.<br /><br />Honestly, Oreo Cakesters transform my mouth into a wonderful world where everything is safe and delicious. The people of this world don't commit crimes or act unjustly. They only care about making your taste buds the happiest they can be. Let Oreo Cakesters into your mouth and into your heart. You owe it to yourself to at least give them a chance. Disappointment is not an option.

So my wife returns from the grocery store with Oreo Cakesters and claims she could not find any hostess items (my guess is she had a coupon).  So anyways I tried one and it was not bad.  It was like a soft extra creamy oreo.  Since I have always liked the white cream of the oreo best I was happy with the cakester.  To me it is not as good as a hostess cupcake but it comes close.  My wife really likes them as she has bought several boxes over the last few weeks and packs them as a mid day snack at work.

review/text: I found these snack cakes to be extremely dense and unfilling. They also fall apart pretty easily. The moist, dense, unflavorful chocolate cake also sticks to everything including your fingers, so beware. Not even my kids liked these, and well, they like just about everything including brussels sprouts.<br /><br />What makes Oreo so great is the crunchy cookie and sweet white icing, but neither of those qualities have been replicated very well in this cake. If you truly want a snack cake stick to Hostess for the best quality, or Little Debbie for the best value.<br /><br />I hope Oreo can revise this snack, because Oreos are a great, timeless product that sell themselves. I don't think many people will be repeat buyers of this particular product, however.

I was addicted to these things while they lasted, but after about 2 weeks, I just finished the last package. Definitely delicious but crumbly and I was always left wanting more. The cream in the middle is soo good. As a kid I always thought it would be awesome to eat oreo cream like they do in the movie "Honey I shrunk the kids" and FINALLY my dream came true! Honestly, I will probably never buy these again, and I wouldn't pay full price for them because I am a cheapo, but they were scrumptious while they lasted.

review/text: I can guarantee every reader of this review that not a single taste test was conducted for this horribly inferior snack cake. Maybe it was my epectation for something delicious that would satisfy my hunger for something cakey and chocolatey. It has its share of chocolate but it takes like spoonfuls of flour flavored with an inferior chocolate powder. And it looks nothing like its picture on the package. There's barely a thin layer of cream, so that doesn't help at all.  Don't think for a moment that its a filled pastry. Its a brown ball of chalky flour and that's about it. A momentous, calamitous failure of epic porportions.

review/text: I'm trying to reduce the amount of sugary snacks in my life but when I get the 'jones' for something sweet these really hit the spot. They're not like the typical raisins you get in the box at the grocery store. These are soft and a bit sticky and have a nice sweet chewiness that really satisfies my cravings.

review/summary: Friggin Delicious!
review/text: I usually purchase Newmans organic raisins and after years of eating the ones in the bright red box at the grocery store (all you raisin eaters know the brand I mean), thought Newmans were pretty tasty....that is, until I tried these. Sweet and plump...I signed up for a subscription. Mix them with raw almonds for a healthy snack the entire household will fight over (no kidding!).

review/summary: Okay
review/text: While these raisins are perfectly fine, I don't really detect a big difference between these and the red boxes from the grocery store.  I did think they seemed to have more of a sugar like substance on the outside of the raisin, kind of reminding me of raisins that come in the bran cereal.  My four year old didn't like these, I thought they were okay, and my husband thought they were really good.  They are okay, but I doubt I'll order again.
