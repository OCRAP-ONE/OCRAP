review/summary: A little piece of Korea
review/text: I always buy the Sempio Gochujang because the taste and scent is just like the one my grandmother used to make a long time ago in Korea. The taste isn't too sweet like many other brands. When I make my husband's food I have to watch the amount of carbs in his&#65279; food. Sempio's brand has less carbs for each tablespoon, which means more sauce for his Bibimbap! BTW, Is it bad that I sometimes just take a spoonful and eat it when I get homesick for Korea?

review/summary: Nice item - Took far too long to get to me!
review/text: Item was one of many purchased for a special fruitcake recipe.  Ordered 1/2/12 - was one of five (in total) items not stocked by Amazon - was assured it'd be shipped within a week to ten days.  Fine.<br /><br />1/22/12 - Amazon sends me a note.. "Barry Farm Foods has not confirmed the shipment" .. order will be canceled.  Do I wish to reorder?<br /><br />1/23/12 - The following day.. another message.. from Amazon.. items have been shipped.  (?)  Claims I should see items by 1/24/12  Well.. Okay..<br /><br />Took until 1/28/12 until the items showed up.  Order was complete - in that these were the items shipped directly from supplier to fulfill the original order.  Shipping charge for that single box was over $11.00.. (for a $22 order of 5 items) for something akin to 3 weeks from order to delivery.<br /><br />Pleased?  Well.. I did finally get the back-ordered items.  I didn't get them in what I consider to be a "timely" fashion.  Communications evidently broke down 'tween Amazon & Barry Farms, as demonstrated by the conflicting emails.  I think that given the long time frame, I way overpaid for so called "shipping" charges.<br /><br />Have had to completely readjust schedule for this special commemorative fruit cake.. it's baked now, turned out well.. is in the "aging" mood now.<br /><br />So.. you asked for this review.. this is it!  I was originally a bit distressed that part of my order would have to come directly from Barry Farms.. but was willing to accept a reasonable wait.  The delays and conflicting emails caused some consternation.  When the items did finally arrive, I was pleased just to have them.  The shipping charges seemed excessive, considering all the time the order took to get to me.  But, I've used the products now, and am really looking forward to sampling the end result.. which will not have the ideal time to age, but should still prove worth all of the hassle.<br /><br />  Peace  -Gerry

review/summary: Superb Variety of Biscuits in Different Shapes and Textures Perfect for Picnics
review/text: The best news about the availability of Carr's Assorted Biscuits for Cheese on Amazon is that they were delivered to me without damage. I have been a fan of their crackers for years, and the nine types available in this selection do not disappoint. The types are the square Cream Cracker, the thick and circular Digestive, the light Small Table Water, the cookie-like Small Wheatmeal, the heavily textured Oyster Cracker, the large Cornish Wafer, the Oblong Water, the small disc-like Bran Carlton and the traditional Choice Grain.<br /><br />There isn't a loser in the bunch and you get several of each kind. There are even helpful pictures of recommended toppings on the box, though if you're lazy like me, you'll get a good wedge of brie and smear it on all of them. They are not the most nutritional of appetizers as the recommended portion of three crackers has 80 calories, of which 25 are fat, and 95 mg of sodium. But luckily the individual boxes are relatively small, so binging can be appropriately curbed. They are perfect for a picnic setting where you don't want to fumble around with noisy chips.

I popped one in my mouth when I first opened the box without anything on it and they were fresh and delicious. Although it says, 'for cheese,' don't feel you can't put other things on them.  Grab some ham, or have them with your favorite soup.  These are some nice biscuits that you will find many uses for and you will enjoy eating.  I recommend this product.  Very good.

review/summary: The Classic Biscuit Assortment
review/text: Carr's states on the box that these biscuits are "The Perfect Complement to Cheese," but of course, they're good for so much more...from peanut butter and jelly on the Bran Carlton biscuit, to caviar on the Small Table Water biscuit! The box also has some nice cheese serving suggestions, like cucumber slice, sour cream, and shrimp on the Oyster Cracker.<br /><br />My favorite is the Digestive biscuit, because I really like the wheatmeal texture and flavor, and also because it reminds me of my English Mum. It was always traditional in her day to wake up to a hot cup of tea and a digestive biscuit, and it certainly is a delightful way to start the day.<br /><br />Carr's Biscuits are the real deal, made in England, and with no "funny stuff" like EDTA in them. Get a couple of boxes of Carr's Assorted Biscuits for Cheese, some Cheshire, Stilton and Cheddar cheeses, warm up some beer, and make your next party an English pub party!

review/summary: If you enjoy a variety of wonderful cheeses these especially nice biscuits (crackers) make an ideal accompaniment
review/text: If you aren't sure why these crackers are called biscuits, just feel comfortable that biscuits are what the English refer to when American's refer to crackers.  Carr's is an excellent maker of various biscuits for all kinds of serving purposes.  This collection has 9 types of crackers with 3 to 5 of each kind.  This selection says they are for cheese, and they are perfect for that purpose.  The box provides a variety of serving selections.<br /><br />What I enjoy about Carr's is that its products have a wonderful flavor, but each flavor complements the food it accompanies rather than overpowering the food.  The cracker is the foundation rather than the star of the creation being enjoyed.<br /><br />This offering has a dozen boxes of this selection being offered for the price.

review/text: I'm writing this review on behalf of my husband who grew up with Carr's.  This is his favorite selection because all the different crackers in it are good.<br /><br />The only drawback was that the first box we opened was mostly smashed up.  I guess this isn't surprising, since the crackers are made in the UK, shipped to the US, sent to the stores, then sent to us - but it was a fairly serious consideration.  Amazon made good, of course.  We have enough crackers to last until 2010 at this rate, and if there are any more smashed boxes, the local birds will eat well.

review/summary: Nice assortment
review/text: There's good variety in this package of crackers (U.S. terminology vs. English biscuits) & suggestions for using them for different hors d'oeuvres--despite the title of "biscuits for cheese."  Some are thin & crunchy (e.g. "oblong water" & "small table water") while others are thicker, more crumbly & with more flavor (e.g. "digestive", "small wheatmeal").  The "oyster cracker" is not the more-or-less spherical U.S. type at all.  I wasn't too thrilled with it (or the "choice grain") either.  I liked the assortment overall though.  I used a tapenade on them of chunky eggplant & olives.  The crackers held up well.  The "water ones" were great, the digestive etc. were a bit thick & flavorful for the topping.  As for health, there isn't much nutritional value; on the other hand not overly full of sugar, salt, or fat.  But, then at your party with the alcohol flowing & these as hors d'oeuvres you're probably not thinking health.

review/text: This review is of the Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini, 1.69-Ounce Pack of 4: this flourescent green drink has the tartness that you would expect of an apple drink, although I did need to dilute it a bit to pull back on it's highly saturated flavor. That done, it is the perfect blend of tart and sweet. Did I mention the COLOR?? It is a bright, flourescent green, not unlike the color of those adorable VW beetles. My children say it looks like "ghost green," or rather like the green mist out of a Scooby Doo episode. It's such fun that we are serving it in a frozen slushie on Halloween as "ghost goo!"

review/summary: Not too bad. Just a little on the sweet side.
review/text: Even though I'm a guy, I still like most of the Crystal Light drink mixes. I've been using the single packets with bottled water for a couple of years. Its cheaper than soda pop and better than Kool-Aid. This one isn't too bad. Just a little sweet and has a different flavor with a bit of green apple to it and a little tart. It's a weird neon green color that kinda surprised me when I first mixed it up. About the only thing I can say against it is it has a odd, almost saccharin after taste. Some of you might not remember that artificial sweetener since they stopped using it a long time ago. But it had a taste that's hard to forget.<br />  Overall, I like this one. Its a good thirst quencher, but that after taste takes a little getting used too. So if I see this in the store I'll probably buy some more of it. If you like something that's just a little on the sweet side and a little tart, you will probably like this one too.<br />  On the plus side its pretty good with a little Spiced Rum in it too! The Rum takes out that almost saccharin sweet after taste. It might go good with a little sparkling water or a little Ginger Ale too.

review/summary: Tastes like sour apple Jolly Rangers, you can also use it in cocktails
review/text: If you like sour apple Jolly Rangers and want to drink a beverage flavored as such, then this mix is for you.  The drink's aftertaste took me a little getting used too, but after I drank a couple glasses, I got used to it.  I don't normally drink low calorie drinks, except soda.  Another boon to this product is that you can mix it as a real cocktail.  The key to it is using a little of the powder and blending with a tiny bit of water, then adding vodka and ice to it.  It still has an aftertaste to get used to, but I prefer it over the regular sugary Sour Apple Pucker or other mixers.  It just takes some time to figure out the ratio of powder to water in order for the finished cocktail not to taste watered down.  If you mix a full 2 quart pitcher and then add vodka, it does taste watered down, so a much more concentrated amount is needed.<br /><br />But the drink without it tastes pretty good.  I find it cooling on a hot day.  It would be good for people who have to avoid alcohol, since it does make a decant mocktail.

review/summary: Good, but a little overly tart for me
review/text: I feel a little bit guilty giving this 3 stars considering that I've never had a true appletini made by a real bartender, so I've nothing to compare it to taste-wise. However, I can't justify giving it a higher rating because I just didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.<br /><br />Taste-wise this wasn't bad. It's very much on the tart side, which I usually like in my drinks and there's a decent flavor here. At times the drink just seemed a little too tart and I can see where people who don't like very sour things wouldn't really be as into this drink. People who are comparing it to a Jolly Rancher are pretty much spot on. I kept thinking that it reminded me of something and when I saw that others thought it reminded them of this candy, I couldn't help but think "that's it exactly!"<br /><br />This just seemed a little too artificial at times for my taste, too much like a packet of grown-up Kool-Aid. This might be what this drink essentially is, but Crystal Light is pretty great at making instant drinks so I did have some pretty high expectations going into this. I'll probably still end up checking out the other flavors and this is still a pretty decent drink overall. I think if I were to add something to it or dilute the drink a little more then maybe it'd be a little better for me.<br /><br />Overall this was a decent enough drink but I'd hesitate to make it a staple of my household beverage drinking.

review/summary: Enjoy an Appletini with 95% less calories!
review/text: Several of my friends have recently begun buying these low calorie flavored drinks you see in most grocery and convenience stores now. Cascade Ice is one brand that produces several based off of common drinks like, Lemon Drop, Pina Colada and Cosmopolitan.  They then mix them with their favorite spirit and have a low calorie drink. They're good because they're pre-made and portable, but you are paying a premium for that.  Either way although I've never been fond of these types of drinks, I was willing to give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LGIY">Crystal Light Moctails Appletini</a> a shot.  One thing I can say I immediately liked was the ease of making the drink, it would be great for when my girlfriends come over. Additionally because the individual packets are so small, it would be just as easy to take some to a friends house to make.  As for the taste, it was pretty good. It definitely wasn't as tasty as an actual Appletini, but I wasn't expecting that.  After my initial taste I did add a shot of vodka into my drink and that made it even better in my opinion. I was curious as to how many calories are being saved off your standard Appletini and what I found was that the original is about 170 calories vs. the Crystal Light at just about 5 calories! Overall I believe that Crystal Light has done a good job of providing a pseudo Appletini and I could see myself buying additional flavors to try out.

review/summary: A Little Too Strong in Taste, But Not Bad in Moderation
review/text: This has a very strong Apple Jolly Rancher taste which is not bad in moderation. It's not something I would want to drink often.  It's a break from the usual Crystal Light flavors.  The price seems a little high (though when you do the math it works out to less than 14 cents per serving.  I have not seen these in the store so I don't know if Amazon's price is comparable.<br /><br />If you don't mind feeling like you are drinking a large liquid apple Jolly Rancher then this might be a nice change of pace for you. Especially if you like Appletini's.

review/summary: Good but not mojito good
review/text: I got both the appletini and mojito mix from amazon vine.  While I enjoyed them both, I found the mojito mix more refreshing than the appletini.  Appletini was very sweet and tasted like a combination of apple and lemon lime kool aid.  I do enjoy these prodcuts.  It is easy to mix up and provides a great drink.  The packages are simple to open and the container could be reused for storage.  Overall I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a sweet treat.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: One of the apprehensions that I have had in the past about buying Crystal Light has been the aftertaste that isn't always pleasant that accompanies sugar substitutes. I must say that the new Crystal Light Mocktails have changed my perspective. The drink was delicious, there was no aftertaste and what's not to love about it only being 5 calories! Each packet makes a huge container that last for days. This is definitely a healthy drink that I have already begun to reccomend!

review/summary: It's ok at first, but not so good later...
review/text: First of all, this flavor smells great.  But who drinks anything just for smell alone?  The first few sips are not bad.. it does remind me of an Appletini, however, if you keep drinking - well, let's just say it might turn your stomach a little.  The artificial sweetener aftertaste in this flavor is a lot stronger than what is found in the other flavors of Crystal Light.  I just don't think I could honestly sit and drink a whole glass of this particular flavor.  Great try - and I wanted so badly to rate it a 3 out of 5, but because I would not drink a whole glass at a time, I couldn't see myself doing so.  Sorry - go back to the drawing board on this one.

review/summary: Looks like antifreeze, tastes like Jolly Ranchers!
review/text: This must be the most odd instant drink I've tasted.  Mixed by itself-(I didn't add alcohol) it tastes just like green apple Jolly Ranchers.  The color is an intense shade of green, but pretty.  I can see this as flavored ice cubes, or a mixer (VODKA!..lol) but I don't think I'll be drinking it plain.  I think I was expective more of an apple juice type drink....which it isn't.

review/text: I really liked this flavor, apart from the bright color which seemed unnecessary.  It's a nice crisp green apple flavor that I enjoyed as an alternative to the standard flavors that are available. I thought the sweetness was just right as well as the tartness.  Didn't try it as a try martini with a shot of vodka, but could see it as a fun, low calorie cocktail.

review/summary: If you love green apple this is the liquid equivalent!
review/text: I really enjoyed the taste of the Crystal Light Appletini Mocktail.  It is a low-calorie solution for someone who does not want to partake in the soda route.  I have always been a fan of green apple Jolly Rancher's and this is its liquid equivalent.  The name Appletini had me prepared for a "tang", slightly tart taste in the drink.  It was not as tart as I expected it to be.  It was actually quite sweet (almost too sweet).  Overall I would recommend this as a purchase and will definitely buy it again.

review/text: I've never been a fan of regular Crystal Light, so I was very surprised to find that new product was so good !  Perfect for those who want a very low calorie "virgin" cocktail or a real one.<br /><br />I'm on a very low calorie, fat free, and sugar free eating plan at the moment, so having a yummy, naughty treat is more important than ever. And this one is perfect.  I haven't tried the other flavors, so I can't comment on those but this one is definitely worth buying!<br /><br />This product is highly recommended for dieters, diabetes, and sugar-conscious individuals.

review/summary: yummy with sour apple aftertaste
review/text: I love the Crystal light products.  I think they are a tasty way to stay hydrated.  The mocktail appletini is a very new and different flavor.  It really does taste like an appletini!  It's has a great apple flavor as you drink, with sort of a sour apple finish.  I think this would be especially fun for parties- especially baby showers or others where you want something fun, different, and refreshing without the alcohol.

review/summary: 100% Jolly Rancher Sour Apple
review/text: If you are wondering what this tastes like, it tastes 100% just like Jolly Rancher sour apple candy, only in a drink version.  For better or worse, the flavor is good but artificial.  It is somewhat refreshing, but I think about 6 ounces (about a juice glass) is the right amount.  I think if I drank a whole lot at once, I would get sick of it.<br /><br />Each package contains 5 packets which each make 2 quarts -- which is 2-1/2 gallons which is a lot.  4 packs = 10 gallons or about two dollars or so per gallon -- rather inexpensive.<br /><br />It is utterly simple to make.  The top of the packet easily tears off, and it is long and skinny to easily pour into any 1/2 gallon jar, bottle, etc.  It dissolves fairly rapidly.  Also, the plastic shrink-wrap easily removes/falls off, so you can reuse the oval container for whatever you want.

review/summary: I like it, but I can't make it sound good
review/text: It tastes like green-apple-flavored candy, plus a bit of a slightly zingy aftertaste from the fake sugar and possibly whatever is supposed to be the "tini" part of the appletini flavor.<br /><br />That doesn't sound especially great, but I really like it.  It's good from washing salty or greasy flavors out of my mouth after lunch.  I can make it a little more dilute when I feel like chugging, or I can make it more intense for sipping.<br /><br />I have not been able to get anyone else to drink this stuff.  Both the concept and the color repels them.  So this will be another of those things I become famous for consuming at the office, much like my Orange Jols and Nile Spice lentil soup.

review/summary: Great Diet Drink
review/text: Nice sour apple flavor, full bodied taste with a crisp apple flavor.  Even the bright green color of this drink is cool.  This Crystal Light Mocktail has good sweetness but is not overpowering.  I've never tried a real Appletini, so I can't say if this is similar to the real thing, but this Mocktail is a very tasty diet drink.  The Appletini tastes better a day after mixing it (maybe the mix and apple flavors become better absorbed into the water after a little time).  A  nice drink to have in the refridgerator pitcher.  I finished an entire 8 serving packet in a day, but who cares? There's only five calories per serving! You can't ask for more than that from a diet drink in my opinion.

review/text: Crystal Light flavors are pretty much hit and miss with me so I was skeptical about this one.  I was almost convinced I would hate it.  For some reason a fake low cal "appletini" just didn't sound appetizing at all.  To my surprise this product is actually delicious!  It tastes like a lighter, crisper, slightly tarter apple juice.  Its very refreshing and you'll get a nice apple flavor without being too heavy or artificial tasting. It tastes a lot like one of my all time favorite low cal beverages, SoBee Life Water's Fugi Apple Pear drink.  I would definitely recommend this product!  Yumm!

review/text: I drink Crystal Light Lemonade all the time and love it. This Appletini flavor is sweet but lacks any hint of crispness or tartness. I have never had an Appletini but I have had apple flavored hard candies. Because it really has a fake apple flavor, it isn't really refreshing. I'll stick with lemonade. This is not a flavor I would want to buy again. Also imparts a strange aftertaste that I don't notice with the lemonade flavors (pink or yellow).

review/summary: Tasty low-cal Mocktail
review/text: Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini, 1.69-Ounce (Pack of 4)<br /><br />If you like Crystal Light drink mixes this is going to be up your alley. It is a unique flavor and tastes good. It does remind me of an apple martini (minus the booze) and is a refreshing treat. Given the artificial sweetener it does have a slight artificial taste but I drink a lot of diet drinks and am quite used to it. Nothing bad with that, it's the price you pay for wanting a very low to no calorie drink that isn't just water.<br /><br />I did try adding vodka to make a real cocktail but it kinda waters down the flavor too much. Making a batch with about a third less water, helped a lot with making a low calorie cocktail that also tasted good. Almost as good as in the bar, but with a lot less calories. Overall, an enjoyable low calorie drink mix that has real cocktail potential.

review/text: Crystal Light's new Mocktails Appletini tastes sweet despite the fact that it doesn't include the carb-packing sugar that makes most similar drinks taste so great.  At only five calories per serving, I have no problem guzzling this stuff down.  It's like drinking a liquid Jolly Rancher Sour Apple candy.<br /><br />I was very surprised at how really sweet this drink tastes.  I couldn't tell that there was no sugar in the mix.  Each packet in the container makes two quarts of Mocktail Appletini, and it's very, very simple to make.  All you do is add cold water to the mix and stir.  That's it!<br /><br />Crystal Light has come a long way since I remember tasting their products many, many years ago.  These Mocktails taste like legitimate sugary drinks and not like a diet drink at all.<br /><br />I highly recommend Crystal Light's Mocktails Appletini to anyone who want a low-calorie, sugary sweet drink!

review/summary: Different Folks, Different Tastes
review/text: Even as an adult I like that sour-sweet taste tingle of Jolly Ranchers.  And that's what this mocktail reminds me of--green apples.  That crispy, crunchy green apple taste is there.<br /><br />Food scientists tell us that we first 'taste' with our eyes.  Then our noses.  The actual taste buds are the last to savor food and drink.  The color of this mocktail is a very vivid green.  While not off-putting, it does not enhance the drink for me.  A calmer green would be just fine; after all, these are intended for adults, not kids.  Sniffing my glass prior to taking a sip, I anticipated the aroma of fresh, green apples.  The whiff I got was more of a chemical version of what apples should smell like; not at all fresh and natural.  However, once past my eyes and nose, I enjoyed the green apple flavor.  Since taste buds and odors are uniquely singular to each of us, I can only report to you my experience and not what you may decide about this product.<br /><br />Here are some ways I can see serving the mocktail:<br />1.  Try mixing this drink with vodka and club soda, serving it very icy cold.  If you're having a party, it certainly would keep down the costs of packaged drink mixes.<br />2.  Mix the drink with either water or milk and make popsicles.<br />3.  Add ginger ale instead of water.<br /><br />I like Crystal Light's lemonade and iced tea flavors more than this one.  It's always good to give something new a try and that's what I suggest you do.

review/summary: Taste Better after you add VODKA
review/text: Like many things you can drink, the addition of alcohol is all the difference.  These "mocktails" are just another 'virgin' style of drink which makes you wonder why bother.  In a real appletini, over fifty percent of the drink should be vodka or gin, without them all you get is a taste that reminded me of a granny smith apple.  While that's all well and good, it's not something I'd want to drink.  I found that the addition of alcohol made it much more palatable but then that defeats the whole idea of a "mocktail".  So at least for this reviewer I'll stick to real 'martinis' and when I want something non- alcoholic, I'll drink Ice-Tea.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz

review/summary: Best Crystal Light Flavor
review/text: Crystal Light is a brand I have mixed feelings about.  I do like that their drinks are so low in calories, but they seem to contain more Aspartame and coloring than anything else I've tried.  My mouth is actually coated with red food dye for hours after drinking some flavors, and the Aspartame, which I normally enjoy in sodas, is really pronounced.  With that in mind, I didn't expect much from this Appletini flavor.<br /><br />The first flavor that struck me when I drank my lovely green mocktail was a surprisingly refreshing apple.  This is the best fake apple I've had.  What followed was the typical Crystal Light artificial aftertaste, but not as bad as in other flavors.  The green color also didn't stick in my mouth much.<br /><br />While I can't fully recommend this product, as far as Crystal Light goes, this is easily my favorite flavor.

review/summary: Just add vodka!--or not...
review/text: My first thought when I saw this product was not positive...I thought...eww, a liquor flavored bevarge? Then I remembered that I've used regular crystal light a few times mixed with rum or vodka for a super low cal martini.<br /><br />So I had to try it.<br /><br />First, I made it with water only. If you are someone who loves the taste of apple, or has given up liquor or hate it, you'd still like this. It is NOT liquor flavored like a martini. It merely tastes like a sweet, crisp apple. I could drink this happily during a workout with just water. No liquor flavor to it yet the taste you love about an appletini.<br /><br />But I'm a fan of martinis. No lie. Especially appletinis.  So....<br /><br />Let's compare. A regular appletini:<br /><br />Calories in regular appeltini according to Livestrong (what I've found the be the most accurate place to look up calories): 502 calories<br /><br />But, if instead, you make an appletini with this using 1-2 oz of vodka and the Crystal Light mix mixed with water to desired strength you are looking at 64-128 calories. 128 would be for a cocktail made with 2 ounces of vodka (gin is the same calories if you want to sub that.) You can cut it to 1 oz of vodka (totally doable for taste) and have a 64calorie drink rather than the 502 calories in the regular sweetened bev. I mean, 502 calories is more than I eat for DINNER. I sure don't wanna have 2 dinners with one that's liquid!...espeically if I have 2 drinks!<br /><br />Bonus? You are told to drink water with your alcohol to avoid a hangover the next day. Done! and Done!<br /><br />Negative: It is made with aspartame which is Nutrasweet. I personally avoid Nutrasweet almost always. However, I am still somewhat addicted to Diet Coke twice a week so until I crack that craving I don't mind substituting a cocktail that's low calorie and has loads less sugar for one that would totally wreck my calorie count for the day. I'd prefer stevia but in the end I still prefer this to a full-out bad boy appletini.<br /><br />oh, it tastes awesome to me! Fresh and crisp! I actually love this during a workout too (without the vodka...HELLO!) ...if you hate drinking plain water as sweet crisp apple taste will help encourage it!<br /><br />It should be noted, don't make one appletini with this full packet.  One packet makes 2 quarts. There are 40 servings per container. I'm not drinking 2 quarts at any time so if I use this just to flavor water I just sprinkle a little in the water to taste. For a martini, I create the water mixture to taste with a small sprinkle of the packet and add a jigger of vodka...and add in more of the packet and/or water if needed.<br /><br />I wish they made these in one serving or two serving packs.<br /><br />I will purchase this often I think...even beats the calories in a glass of wine and I love this taste with plain water or in a martini.<br /><br />Note: flavored with natural flavors, gluten-free

review/summary: Green Apple Drink
review/text: Crystal Light has entered the market of non-alcoholic mix drinks with a few flavors. This review is for the appletini mix and too me was not my favorite tasting of their new product line yet still flavorful. For a crystal light product this flavor is very well done. As with their other mixes it is not as good as a freshly made real drink but it is a refreshing drink with the green apple favor and a bright green color. An up side is that an eight ounce glass of crystal light has only five calories, The container contains five separate packets that will each make two quarts of the mix with just the addition of water. Note, if you do not like the regular Crystal Light products because of the artificial sweeteners you will rate this lower than I did. If you like green apple flavored hard candy's you may well love this mix.

review/text: I like the idea of having a no-alcohol drink with low calories and zero points. The Crystal Light Appletini is like drinking liquid Apple Jolly Ranchers; just delightful. My wife though it was a little sweet (this from a woman who puts multiple Splenda packets in her coffee), but I found it to be just right. This is certainly a big chance from the usual low calorie powder drinks. Can't wait to try the other flavors!

review/summary: Appletini Mocktail by Crystal Light
review/text: I don't drink alcoholic beverages so I don't know how a true Appletini should taste but since I am on a sugar-free diet I thought a little variety couldn't hurt. The first thing I noticed when I mixed up a pitcher of the Appletini Mocktail was the vivid neon green color that only a kid could like. Then I tasted it. As another reviewer stated, my first thought was of a sour apple Jolly Rancher only this was not very sour. In fact, this particular drink is excessively sweet and has a very artificial flavor and aftertaste. This is not something that I would enjoy on a regular basis - in fact I'm not sure I can even finish the first pitcher full.<br /><br />I know that so far this product has received many 5-star reviews but it was a stretch for me to give it two. I simply did not like it. I suggest that you read all the reviews before purchasing and make your own decision on whether this is a product you would enjoy.

There may be a little more color/dye than I prefer, but it dissoved nicely and adds nice variety to the monotony of the flavors available in mix-yourself drinks.<br /><br />I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because the flavor name is a little misleading-- I was imaginging this to be something that could easily be made into a mixed drink. If you want a green apple Jolly Rancher, then ok!~ But otherwise, the name might be a little inaccurate in my opinion.<br /><br />Refreshing, different, worth it to me for the variety.

review/summary: Low cal cocktail
review/text: I've tried all of the Cyrstal Light Mocktails, including the margarita and mojito mixes, and this one is another delicious hit (although the margarita is my favorite). I'm not a "mocktail" kind of person and so I added gin to this 2 quart mix and here's the skinny: Adding 8 ounces (1 cup) of gin to the 2 quart mix will make each 8 ounce appletini 70 calories or each 12 ounce serving 105 calories. That's amazing, considering each non Crystal Light version of an appletini is 502 calories (12 ounce serving)!! The taste is very much like apple pucker, but I do like apple pucker, so that was okay with me. If you want to avoid the apple pucker taste, try adding a 4 ounces of apple cider to the mix (only 15 calories per ounce). This will still only make each 8 ounce serving only 78 calories or a 12 ounce serving 124 calories, which is still eons better than the real thing. Anyway, I love all the flavors, and this is another one I'm recommending.

review/summary: A nice change of pace
review/text: This item sounded really good and like something that I could enjoy while at work.  I was right.  It is really yummy and something that I would consider purchasing again.<br /><br />I didn't know what an Appletini was, as I don't drink very often (had a six-pack of Bud Light in the cupboard for cooking for the past six months), but I know that I really like apple flavored candies and what not, so I took a risk and it is wonderful.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have is I wish that they came in single serving packs instead of the 2 quart one, that way it would be a lot easier to transport to work and back.

review/text: This crystal lite is both tart and sweet. Its about time someone made a drink that is  flavored like granny smith apples.  This drink is luscious and only 5 calories per glass.  The grandkids came in for a drink, spied the green drink and hit it hard.  They usually turn their noses up at my diet drinks but they said this was the best stuff they had drank in awhile.  I agree. The first 2 quarts are gone.  Keep up the good work Crystal Light.

review/summary: Great change of pace for sugar free drinks
review/text: Crystal Light's new cocktail based flavors are a welcome addition to the lineup of sugar free drink mixes out there, which traditionally has much fewer options for those who can't have sweet drinks.  Of course the cocktail versions are all rather fruity, with appletini, mojito, and margarita varieties now available.<br /><br />Of the new types available, the appletini variety is easily the most flavorful and packs the most punch.  It essentially tastes like a non-alcoholic version of its namesake, and isn't nearly as light as the mojito edition.<br /><br />And for those wondering, yeah, it's pretty tasty with a splash (or much more) of vodka as well.  For those tired of traditional fruit or iced tea flavors in sugar free drinks, this one is a real winner and a fantastic change of pace.

review/text: I'm pretty much apathetic to this flavor, to be honest.  I mean, if presented with water 'enhanced' with Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini, I'd drink it.  If not, I don't feel like I am missing anything special.  I like the idea of the mocktail flavors as an option; however, my big issue is that I get the apple flavor up front and then the artificial sweetener aftertaste, so it nullifies the intent in my opinion.  Try it, don't try it.  I don't have a recommendation either direction.

review/summary: Ooootini!
review/text: This was actually really nice. It's the color, taste and aroma of green apple, jolly rancher style. I liked the taste and the color was candy color green perfect.<br /><br />The only thing I would do differently is use one packet to one quart of water. At two quarts the power of the apple taste was really muted. With ice it's more noticeable, but with a 1 to 1 ratio it was a nice little punch of apple and on ice, I thought it was perfect as a drink.<br /><br />So for me it loses a star if you make it according to directions. Other than that, if you like green apple candy, you'll love this.<br /><br />4 stars.

review/summary: Different than the usual.
review/text: I've tried many low calorie drink mixes as a way to spruce up a glass of water here and there.  Sometimes I just want something with some flavor!  I mixed up a jug of this (instead of by the bottle or glass, this makes two quarts) and popped it in the freezer so it would chill faster.  Everybody passed along the cold jug and poured themselves some and we all liked it!  Outside of the very green color, it has a nice flavor that is a little sweet and a little tart, not too strong but not watery.  I generally prefer products that do not contain aspartame, but I did not feel that there was much aftertaste at all, which was a pleasant surprise.  I do not feel like it tastes very apple-y, but it also isn't overly artificial.  Definitely a new flavor instead of a retread of a common flavor, a nice alternative to the same old drink or plain old water.

review/text: Great taste of real apple without the syrupy sweet candy flavor makes this a great choice.

review/summary: Pretty darn tasty
review/text: This is perfect for the person who likes Crystal Light, and also like Appletinis (but dislikes the calories).  It's very similar - perhaps a bit less tangy and a bit sweeter, but it still has that nice apple taste. It also lacks, of course, the alcohol taste. This would also be perfect for the person who like the look and feel of holding a drink (I love the bright green color) but wants to eschew the liquor.<br /><br />I made it a bit stronger than the package recommended because I found it just *slightly* watery, but I usually add extra Chrystal Light no matter what the flavor, so it's probably just me.  I like my drinks strong!<br /><br />I think this is a fun new flavor of Chrystal Light and I hope they keep it around - I'll definitely buy it!<br /><br />*In the interests of full disclosure, I received this product through Amazon Vine*

review/text: This drink mix was intriguing to my taste buds.  I love anything that is apple flavored, especially green apples, which is what the Crystal Light Appletini Mocktail tasted like.  It was a bit on the sour side, but for me that was a plus.  At five calories for a glass, it is also practical for anyone looking to stay on their diet.  The cost was actually reasonable when you look at the price of other sugar-free drinks.  I am already thinking about trying the other flavors in the Mocktail line.

review/text: I'd seen an add for these in a magazine recently, but my local grocery store hasn't had them in stock, so I was really glad to get the chance to try the Appletini flavor out.  It's delicious!  While it certainly doesn't taste like the real thing, it's got a nice, light flavor that is different from all the other powdered drink mixes out there.<br /><br />Also, a few reviewers mentioned that it tastes a bit like a Jolly Rancher in its sourness, but I don't think that it's sour at all.<br /><br />I try not to drink more than one glass of Crystal Light a day because I worry about the aspartame in it, which this one also has.<br /><br />Overall, a really tasty drink!  I'm eager to try to mojito one next.

review/summary: Bright and green and definitely appley
review/text: I tried Crystal Light's Margarita drink mix last week, and now I turn to the Appletini, which has a much clearer, more focused and easy-to-define flavor. The taste is a lot like apple cider, but more mellow, not tart. The apple comes through strongly. And as far as being similar to the apple martini drink? Well, only in the nice, strong apple flavor. I don't detect anything else in there. But it's a very pleasant drink.<br /><br />As with the Margarita drink, the color is a neonish green, though brighter in this case.<br /><br />I appreciate the ease of using these mixes. The powder dissolves quickly into a nice, crystal-clear liquid. And it's a flavorful drink without the calories or the caffeine, so I can enjoy it in the evenings after work -- that's a plus.

review/text: I love the flavor of apple and enjoy a good appletini.  Crystal Light has come up with a way to echo the flavor of appletini and apple without the alcohol and the calories.  One packet makes two quarts; just pour the packet in the water and stir to dissolve.  I prefer mine over crushed ice.  It's sugar free, low sodium and only has five calories per serving.  The packaging is eye-catching and holds the packets in a sturdy container.  You get five packets per container, which makes ten quarts, so it's very economical.  It tastes great! Not too sweet and not too tart, very crisp and refreshing.

review/text: I like this flavor.  Definitely has a nice apple taste to it.  Really does taste like an appletini without the alcohol.  I do think it's just a touch on the sweet side, but I actually dilute my with about 1/3 water and 2/3 mixed beverage and it tastes much better (and goes a lot farther!).  I would recommend this drink, very refreshing and good.<br /><br />P.S. it doesn't really make a good mixer for a real appletini.  The flavor gets covered up by the alcohol (I tried using vodka) and it ends up just becoming a sugary water drink with alcohol.

review/summary: Sugar Free Sour Apple Delight
review/text: I can get kind of nostalgic about the days when I was a kid, when I could go into Circle K or 7-Eleven, and get one of those great big sour-apple slurpees.  Sure they were 99% sugar, and would pucker up your face, and tasted nothing like apples, but it sure was good nonetheless.  Now fast forward many years later, and sugar is a no-no, but here comes Crystal Light coming out with these wonderful sour apple flavored drink mixes.<br /><br />Are these my favorite?  No, not by a long shot (that would be their heavenly Peach Mango).  They don't taste like Apple, and they aren't even the best artificial sour-apple flavor I've ever tasted, but it's the only drink of it's kind that I know of, that is sugar free.  And it is extremely refreshing.<br /><br />If you are like me and long for a guilty-pleasure of a sour apple drink, but without the sugar, these fit the bill.

review/text: This drink has a definite apple flavor, although think artificial green apple lollipop flavor and not apple juice.  The drink is pretty darn sweet, perhaps too sweet for some, but tasty. Too sweet to be particularly refreshing or thirst quenching, but unique. The mocktails angle of this line of crystal light drinks seems to be more marketing than reality. I suppose one could add vodka or tequila to this drink, but it still would not taste like an apple martini, although the flavor does remind me of apple pucker liquor, although very sweet and not tart. If you tire of drinking Crystal Light's other flavors, such as punch or iced tea, this may make a nice change for a while. However, I suggest the Sunrise Orange, which has an authentic orange flavor, and not the artificial tinge of this apple mocktail.

review/summary: The First Taste...
review/text: Each time I've tried the Crystal Light Appletini drink, my first taste is crisp, light, refreshing, with a color reminiscent of the green apples we all know...<br /><br />After awhile, though, the sour taste became predominant for me and I wasn't quite so enthused (I don't like sour and didn't anticipate the product being made that way). Still, for those who enjoy a sour taste, the reduction of calories for this drink mix, makes it a great alternative to the other flavors routinely available.<br /><br />The package for review included 5 2 quart packets. With a serving, it's about 5 calories<br /><br />I think you'd really have to enjoy the sour apple flavor, which I personally would not normally choose...I guess I could consider a sweetener...LOL...but that would be cheating a little for purposes of the review, wouldn't it.<br /><br />I'll leave it up to you who buy drink mixes... but I thought the price was high for 10 quarts of, essentially, apple juice? You decide...

Having said that, I enjoy a nice (regular) Appletini as much as the next gal, so I mixed this in a nice pitcher, added filtered water, stirred with a long glass drink stirrer and enjoyed.<br />Granted, the taste is not an exact Appletini, but for 5 calories, I can let my imagination make up for the rest.  If you are watching your calories and/or it's not 5pm in your town, make a pitcher (I used about a cup or two water less than 2 quarts...I like sweet drinks) and give it a try.  It's not an exact replica of the drink, but it's close enough...you will get the essense of an appletini.

review/summary: Not bad. Insanely green!
review/text: It looks like something out of an evil scientist's laboratory. I've had all sorts of green beverages, but this looks very much like that ominous green liquid that was in every episode of The X-Files! The packaging is what threw me off a little. I saw red/purple and assumed it was a red apple drink. When I saw the green I was pretty surprised. It's flat-out neon green. Which makes it fun in a weird way.<br /><br />Tastes a lot like green apple Now & Laters, only not as sweet or tart. Like, 65% of the Now & Later taste. It's pretty good.

review/summary: Wish These Were Available All The Time
review/text: I read that the Crystal Lite Mocktails would only be available through the summer. OH SAY IT ISN'T SO!! I like these so much I really wish they'd make them available year round.<br /><br />I've never had a "real" appletini so wasn't sure what to expect. I'm not really wild about apple juice so I was hoping the taste of this wouldn't be too similar.....and it's not.<br /><br />This has a taste that's more like a Granny Smith apple. Sweet and tart at the same time, though not too sweet. I don't buy Crystal lite that often because most of the flavors I've tried are too sweet for my taste. This has a nice balance of tart and sweet.<br /><br />I put some of this in my slushy mug and it was wonderful. Wish I'd have thought to try this earlier in the summer because I can see myself drinking this long after summer is gone.<br /><br />The mojito flavor is still my favorite but I like this enough that I'll be ordering more of it.<br /><br />One last thing: about the container - you can peel off the plastic wrapper and are left with a sheer canister that can be re-used! I filled one with tiny twist pretzels that I keep in my desk. I buy nuts and trail mix in bulk and this container is a nice size to store fair amounts of those. I also like the shape. It's taller and more slender than many of the containers I use in my husband's lunches and this fits better in his lunch box. Not leak proof though so is best for dry foods.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: I've never had a real Appletini so I can't say whether or not this tastes like the real thing, but I thought it was pretty good.  If I had not read the label and had no idea what flavor it was supposed to be, I don't think I could tell you.  It definitely doesn't taste like apple juice or cider.  Maybe slightly like sour apple hard candies, only it's not sour.  It's really pretty sweet.  The color of the drink is bright green, so that's kind of fun.  I can't say for sure that I'll buy this flavor again, but I will try the other Crystal Light Mocktails.  I'm always looking for new low calorie drinks to try.

review/text: "Crystal Light gives women..."<br />Well then send me a copy of this months Glamour and call me Antoinette, because as a dude, I happened to enjoy this drink very much.  It tastes like an appletini, without the liquor, of course. Refreshing and tart, I'll definitely be adding this to my diet drink rotation.

review/summary: Jolly Rancher candy in liquid form?
review/text: I admit I laughed out loud when I saw another reviewer of this product compare it to liquid apple-flavored Jolly Ranchers. Now that I have had it for myself, I have to agree that this was spot-on!<br /><br />I received a sample of this product through the amazon Vine program and had my daughter mix some up for us to try with the evening meal, tonight. The kids loved it! I think part of it was the novelty of the whole thing, as our family doesn't drink a great deal of powder-mix drinks aside from Gatorade. The color of the drink is nearly identical to apple Jolly Ranchers, the drink smelled like apple Jolly Ranchers, and the drink tasted like apple Jolly Ranchers. I have never had an a real alcoholic Appletini beverage, so I can't say whether or not this drink tastes anything like a real Appletini, but this particular mix was well-received by my kids. My wife doesn't drink soft drinks or kool-aid-type drinks, so she abstained from having any of it.<br /><br />Like other Crystal Light drinks, this mix is sugar-free and very low-calorie (only 5 calories per serving), so that should appeal to many consumers. I imagine most kids who enjoy kool-aid-type drinks will like this, and if you're looking to cut down on your children's caloric intake or frequency of cavities, this is a good alternative to those types of drinks.

review/summary: Too sweet and not very tart
review/text: I'm not much of a drinker, but when my friends and I do get together, we usually have a celebratory Appletini.  We have perfected our recipe over the years so that it is not too sweet, not too tart, and doesn't have too much of a kick to it.  I was excited to try the mocktail but it was a disappointment.  The drink was much too sweet and not at all tart.  I added more water hoping to cut the sweetness but that made the drink very tasteless.  The idea is great but the execution needs more refinement.  Not a do-over.

review/summary: way too sour
review/text: I don't drink so I've never had a non-alcoholic appletini.  I do, however, always drink sugar free beverages.  I was optimistic about this one, Crystal Light has so many flavors I like!  I made a pitcher of it soon after it came.  It only took one tiny sip for me to know I can't drink any more of it!  It's SO sour!  My 12 yr old loves sour things so I'll give the rest to him but I will NEVER use this flavor again!

review/summary: The consensus was positive
review/text: When it comes to matters of taste, the larger the number of people, the easier it is to judge. I don't think Amazon expected me to drink eight quarts of this, so I made a pitcher for some college freshmen. The consensus was positive across the board, and they all had good things to say about the taste. At least one of the young ladies mentioned that she never had a real appletini, and in theory none of them should have had them. But even the real ones should vary in taste, I suppose, so it should be taste that governs.<br /><br />I'd have no qualms about serving up a pitcher of these to guests.  I would not expect any mock drink to taste exactly like its alcoholic counterpart. Whether this taste exactly like appletinis I can't say, but ultimately what counts is that it tastes good.

review/text: I think if I were to like crytal light better, I might enjoy this more.<br />Crytal light is very sour to me and very fake tasting in my view. But I guess it is kind of healthy if you compare to real lemonade etc.<br />Appletini tasted like fake green apple flavored fake lemonade.<br />OK, I like it better than just water - I am not a pure water fan. But I cannot take this in large dosage.

review/summary: Tini on calories.  Big on apple taste.
review/text: I really miss being able to have a cocktail or two, especially kicking back and watching the sunset, after a hard week.  It's not the booze so much, but the flavors and the look of some of the concoctions (tropical juices and flavors, to compliment the palm trees here on the Gulf Coast), that make it such a treat for me.  I was thrilled to see that Crystal Light has introduced some new flavors to their line, calling them "Mocktails"...  I don't mind the artificial sweetener, as I would not drink Crystal Light as a regular beverage for hydration purposes, the way I drink plain water. I'm not too thrilled about the artificial dye in the mix (I have G6PD deficiency and my family generally avoids food dyes derived from petroleum).  The flavor, though is wonderful.  It's very appletini-ish, reminds me of those green apple Jolly Rancher candies we used to get at camp.  Sweet with just a bit of tartness, but not calorie and sugar-laden. Perfect with ice cold water, served over crushed ice.  I think it would be fantastic over shaved ice/slushy ice...

review/summary: Appletini it's not
review/text: Now, we have a lot of Crystal Light in the pantry (Raspberry Lemonade is a favorite). I don't mean to sound like a broken record about my recent Crystal Light Moctail reviews, but...<br />This Appletini just *isn't*. Once you get it in your mind that hey, it reminds you of Jolly Ranchers, then that is all you'll think about as you sip it. Which makes it taste gross, the thought of liquid Jolly Ranchers in your glass. (Yes it also has the aspartame aftertaste...) Like the Margarita, it seemed to be quickly overwhelmed with the ice and would probably have held up better if using two pouches for the 2 quarts instead of one.<br /><br />None of us liked this, not even a little bit. The smell was a little gagful. It's not a flavor that I could consider mixing with something else to make it taste good. (That's pretty bad!) One plus, it's so green that you could probably foist it off on Trick-Or-Treaters in October, as "Witch Brew"!

review/summary: Really strong taste but also gave me a headache.
review/text: For the mixture recommendations on the package this is stuff has a REALLY strong taste and I don't care for that too much but that's an easy fix with just adding more water to knock it down a level. I don't mind the flavor at all but I quickly found out that I have a reaction to something in this mix as each time I tried I ended up with a headache from hell. The first time I just thought it was because I had been working on my computer for 16 hours a day for a couple days but after the next 2 times I realized it was the crystal light that was doing it.<br /><br />NOT COOL.<br /><br />The package says one packet makes 2 quarts, I watered this stuff down with a full gallon and thought it tasted pretty good at that level but the headache still happened even at that level.<br /><br />This product contains ASPARTAME, which is an artificial sweetener, I've never had the stuff before because I don't care for artificial stuff but apparently I can't have it to begin with as that is more than likely the culprit in the headaches that this stuff gave me.<br /><br />ASPARTAME/PHENYLKETONURICS contains PHENYLALANINE<br /><br />Phenylalanine is found naturally in the breast milk of mammals. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement for its reputed analgesic and antidepressant effects. It is a direct precursor to the neuromodulator phenylethylamine, a commonly used dietary supplement.<br /><br />That's just a little bit of info for you, you can do with it as you like...<br /><br />I don't know 100% that this is what caused my headache but it's the only off ingredient listed on the back panel. With that I'm drawn to conclude that it is was caused the problems I had. Regardless I will be sure to stay away from products containing this stuff in the future...<br /><br />NUTRASWEET contains a form of aspartame in it as well.

review/summary: Great Addition To Crystal Light
review/text: I want to start this review with,<br /><br />"I have never had an Appletini, so I can't compare as to how this tastes against a real one."<br /><br />I really enjoyed the flavor of this drink.  The apple is very pronounced and crisp.  Very refreshing drink.<br /><br />I think it has a much stronger flavor than some of the other Crystal Lights that I have tried.<br /><br />The only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is I found it tasted its' best when icy cold.  Once it started warming up, the taste wasn't as sharp, and adding too many ice cubes to keep cold watered it down quickly.<br /><br />This is one Crystal Light I would buy again.

review/summary: Fun new apple martini flavor!
review/text: I found the new Crystal Light mocktails at my local grocery store for about three bucks each initially, but now they aren't there any more.  This is the only place I know to get them. Crystal Light's new flavors are Mojito, Margarita, and Appletini. I love real Mojitos and Appletinis and I also love Crystal Light (though I had been a bit bored of most of the flavors at this point). The Appletini mix is like drinking Jolly Rancher green apple candy. It has that fake-apple taste and a slight sourness, which is very similar to the less expensive appletini mixes. If you make your own appletinis using things like sour apple pucker, you will likely not appreciate this.  I like it in small doses.  UPDATE: after 3 canisters, I really can't drink this one any more. It's too cloying.  But I still love the mojito!<br /><br />Each canister has 5 packets, and each packet makes two quarts. An 8 ounce glass is 5 calories. Keep in mind that a real appletini (3 to 4 oz) can be about 160 calories.<br /><br />If you want something similar to Appletinis and delightfully different from other Crystal Lights, you'll love this! I have several non-drinking friends who come to our dinner parties (which have lots of alcohol flowing), and this is a great option for them.<br /><br />I like the Mojito and Margarita better though.

review/summary: Different and flavorful
review/text: I like both Jones Soda and the Izze in the sour apple flavor, but don't need all the sugar. While this is not carbonated like the aforementioned, it does capture that sour apple flavor quite nicely. It is a fun change of pace from citrus drinks or other diet sodas. I would love it even more if it was carbonated, but still find it quite refreshing. I hope Amazon branches out to carry some of the other "mock cocktail" flavors that Crystal Light has developed.<br /><br />**UPDATE** I have started putting a sprinkle of this into a diet ginger ale on the rocks and it is even better than the sugary apple sodas! Delish!

review/summary: Do you enjoy candy-like faux green apple flavor?
review/text: If you love "sour green apple" candy, like the classic Jolly Rancher apple flavor, this is the best bet for the same flavor in liquid format. Mixed with enough ice to make it freezing cold and slightly weaker, it's refreshing. The "mocktail" marketing gimmick is really just a gimmick: cute packaging that puts you in the mindset of a more adult-oriented flavor. But it really is just candy green apple kool-aid. Whether you see that as a positive or negative recommendation is according to your personal taste.

review/text: I typically love all things green apple but this seems to be the exception to the rule. I made a pitcher, drank about half a cup and poured the rest down the sink. The flavor is what I would expect if Kool-aid could go bad. (not a fan of kool-aid either so that's pretty bad in my book)<br />I still have the rest of the package left so we may experiment with it during our next ladies night. Maybe alcohol will help transform taste.... of course that kind of defeats the purpose.

review/summary: Another Great Crystal Light Beverage
review/text: Need an appletini fix in the middle of the day? Want to waste away to another place while at work? Well, Crystal Light's new Mocktails Appletini might be just what you're looking for. With a taste that takes you away to the islands, Mocktails Appletini is the answer to that stressful day. Obviously, these are non-alcoholic, but I figure I might as well put that in here (just in case someone asks). For a refreshing drink that is a break from the ordinary, try out Crystal Light Mocktails ...

review/summary: delicious for only 5 calories
review/text: Yum!  I thought this was delicious -- it was very sweet and appley and crisp- not bad for 5 calories a serving.  This is a great alternative to the standard Crystal Light flavors.  If you're comparing it to a cocktail appletini, well, you may well be disappointed, but if you're comparing it to Crystal Light lemonade, it holds up well.  I found the flavor more crisp than cloying, and very refreshing.<br /><br />The package contains five foil tubes of drink mix, not four as advertised, and not the individual tubes you often find now.  I just use a little of the powder at a time rather than making a whole pitcher at once.<br /><br />Interesting that this product is marked as something "for women" -- as I don't know what's inherently woman-only about an apple-flavored beverage, but after one tasted, my hubbie did wrinkle his nose after one sip.  But I like it and plan to get more.

review/text: Okay, since this is minus the booze this is a severe setback as I was a fan of the original appletini for its potent and flavorful buzz.<br /><br />That being said for a low calorie drink this did have a pretty fair apple flavor and was refreshing enough to hit the spot & go beyond the usual kool-aid, berry flavors. Too bad it is a limited edition flavor as I could get used to this.

review/summary: More like Apple than Appletini
review/text: When you mix this up, you get a neon green drink that suggests something wild. But when you drink it, there's just a mild apple flavor. The Margarita Mocktail, though not exactly a margarita, had more zip than this does. If you're looking for a lo-cal apple drink, this is a good enough option and the color is interesting. But if it's the "mocktail" part that intrigues you, the margarita mocktail is a better pick.

review/text: The Appletini tastes better than crystal lights other mocktail mixes. It does have a slight artificial sweetener aftertaste.<br />If you have used crystal light before you should be used to that. It tasted like one of those green sour apple candies.
