review/summary: Decent tea but not so vanilla
review/text: I'm always looking for a solid herbal tea that is decaffinated for evenings.  And this one is pretty good.  It has real blackberry flavor in it from dried blackberries which I enjoyed.  It also has a good amount of hibiscus flowers which gives it a gorgeous deep reddish magenta hue and a tartness that is kind of astringent, like cranberry.  Another plus is the little silky pyramid bags you usually get in a more upscale tea which makes it more like a ritual somehow.  And the colorful pieces of herbs and flowers and berries is very attractive inside the pouch.<br /><br />The first sips didn't give me any vanilla flavor at all.  After the tea had cooled slightly I started to taste like a subtle warm sweetness, which I'm assuming is supposed to be the vanilla aspect of this tea which is due to "natural flavor" and not actual vanilla.  I couldn't say for sure of course, but I think since it doesn't say "vanilla" anything in the ingredient list that it doesn't have any real vanilla parts in it.  I guess it's like how you can buy either vanilla flavoring or vanilla extract at the grocery store with the vanilla flavoring being a cheaper and inferior product.<br /><br />Overall an enjoyable cup of herbal tea but I'm yet again bummed by faux vanilla 'flavor' in a grocery store tea.  I think the real deal must be very costly to produce because the only tea I have ever had that had actual dried vanilla pods in it cost a small fortune per ounce at a tea house in Savannah, GA.  But that tea was unbelievably sublime.  They should really repackage this as Blackberry Hibiscus Tea and I'd be all over it.  And just quit making teas with vanilla in it unless they can get the real thing.

review/summary: taste pretty good
review/text: i drink alot of tea, so i decided to try this.  i measured exactly 8 ounces of water for the cup.  i like my tea strong & this bag gave a very satisfying brew.  the taste is good, a bit tart, slightly sour.  i think the hibiscus flowers give it the sour taste, but i grew to like it.  the vanilla taste is subtle, not overwhelming which is good.  the bags are a new design to me.  they're little plastic triangles which i think allow more water to seep more thoroughly.  good idea.<br /><br />i recommend this tea & i think i'll seek out other flavors in this line.

review/text: I like my tea strong so I was hoping the the pyramid bag would allow for more/stronger favor.  Didn't seen to be any stronger than my favorite Tazo Teas.  If it were on sell or something I would consider Lipton Herbals but if not...  The flavor was good though once I used two bags (use two bags of Tazo also if the tells you anything).

review/summary: Fun Flavors, Very Sweet
review/text: A quality product with a fun, interesting flavor. I'm fond of both blackberries and vanilla, and found that both flavors stood out in this tea. The only drawback was that it was very sweet, and my taste buds were a little put off. If you're into teas with a strong, fruity flavor, then this would be worth a try.

review/summary: Fruity tasting, great over ice
review/text: The Lipton Blackberry Vanilla tea has a very fruity flavor with a hint of the flowers that are also in it.  I first tried it hot and while the flavor was good, it seemed so reminiscent of a juice drink that I poured it over a glass of ice after steeping it.  It tastes great cold.  The tea is a bright, cranberry red and looks like fruit juice.  The teabags are clear, pyramid shaped that allow you to clearly see their contents.  They are quite pretty and it is interesting to see all the ingredients.<br /><br />I will definitely buy this tea again, but will probably drink it cold as I seem to prefer it that way.

review/summary: Okay, but I think would be better cold!
review/text: I'm new to the hot tea party but open to try new ones so when I saw this on Amazon Vine, I decided to give it a go. Mostly because I've been intrigued by the pyramid tea bags for what feels like forever.<br /><br />The tea bag itself is actually made out of a type of plastic. It wasn't a mesh bag like I expected it to be. Cool concept. Steeping time didn't take as long as it usually does with a mesh bag so I appreciated that. Also clean up wasn't as messy. Pull the bag out, let it drain for a few seconds and toss. Didn't have to squeeze it out or wait for a long period of time like with my other tea's.<br /><br />The tea itself is a nice red color. Reminds me of red jello almost. The scent to match! You can immediately smell the bits of raspberry and blackberry in the tea. It smells tarty, tarty enough to make your mouth water. I decided to sweeten mine with sugar instead of honey for once and while it made the tea little bit sweeter, I still was unable to pick up the vanilla flavor. Like, at all!<br /><br />Overall, I was pretty pleased with this tea. The flavor is a good amount of strong and it was tarty. But I think because I'm much more use to herbal tea's I didn't enjoy this as much as the ones I usually drink. I feel like this would be much more enjoyable if were made cold instead of hot since it's both fruity and tarty.<br /><br />I was really disappointed to not be able to taste the vanilla flavor. I think that would had made a fantastic addition to the taste of this tea.

review/summary: Good for Fans of Fruity Teas
review/text: While this tea cannot match the blend I used to get from a local tea merchant, I did enjoy it. It's sweet and tangy, the blackberry very prominent, so no extra sugar was needed. I didn't taste much vanilla, but I am okay with that. This was my first time using the pyramid bags from Lipton. The leaves were larger than what I usually find in Lipton bags, so that was a plus.<br /><br />The directions said to steep for 4-6 minutes. I did, but found the tea not quite strong enough for me. 10 minutes yielded a tastier cup. One time I forgot all about it, and I left it steeping for about an hour. I tried it and while the blackberry was very strong, it wasn't bitter.<br /><br />Would make a very nice iced tea.

review/summary: lipton goes luxury
review/text: A pleasant addition to the Lipton line of teas. The blackberry vanilla is a blend of several fruits and flowers including<br />Hibiscus flowers, Rosehips, sweet Blackberry leaves, dried black currant pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces,<br />dried raspberry pieces and some "natural" flavors.<br /><br />You do need to infuse the recommended time of 4-6 minutes to release the full flavors of the tea. The dominant flavor is the blackberry as<br />expected in the name.<br /><br />We enjoyed it both hot and iced.<br /><br />The pyramid bag design most closely mimics an infuser which is often used for higher end and bulk teas.<br />It seems to work allowing the flavors to escape through the skin of the bag.<br /><br />A nice product and presentation.

review/summary: Awesome! Tastes Great Hot and for Iced Tea!
review/text: MUST HAVE TO ADD FOR A HOLIDAY GIFT BASKET CREATION! Honestly, my first reaction after tasting this was "This tastes like a pie, sans the crust, whipped cream, and ala mode (Ice Cream)"!  Take my word for it - it is amazing, soothing, and relaxing; as well as unreal to believe that it is even a Herbal Tea! Even the grandchildren and their friends loved it for I made a small batch of tea, added a little sugar, slightly watered it down - and it was gone before you knew it and they wanted MORE! The aroma out of the box would leave one questionable; but once you've brewed it ... I had one of the children's mother asking if I was "Baking a Pie?" When she found out it was tea, she insisted on trying this too ... very unsure about it at first, having it hot, then letting it cool down a bit; loved it to death. Finding out that it comes from Amazon because she's never seen this in stores before ... she is just going to have to look for this one up. The teabags themselves are very unique and perfect in style, unlike those paperish form type, this is a mesh-type which enables the flavors to all blend in together in harmony.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this 100% .... *blush* ... I have already drunk 32 ounces of this Caffiene-Free Tea and *sigh* ... I feel like I've had an early Thanksgiving already.

review/text: The first word that came to mind with my first taste of this tea was tart, as in -pucker up- tart. Second word was very strong berry flavor.<br />The second cup I added half and half and 1 teaspoon of sugar.

review/text: The Lipton Herbal Blackberry Vanilla tea was good, but a bit too fruity for me. It had almost a "medicine" taste for some reason. I thought it could have really used a bit more vanilla to tone down the fruitiness. Other than that it was a good herbal tea with a lot of flavor.

Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla Tea, in its distinctive pyramid shape, allows the full essence of both flavours to circulate and infuse into a truly enjoyable tea experience. The scent alone is warming and peace-inducing, and holds a chilly day at bay. This is the tea I would choose, with a little honey, for days when I'm feeling under the weather. This is a great addition to your tea inventory.

review/summary: Not My Usual Flavor, but Tasty!
review/text: I usually drink Earl Grey, with the occasional Green Tea tossed in for good measure.  Lipton is my favorite tea brand, so when I saw this item, I thought I'd give it a try.  Liptons Herbal Pyramid  Tea (named for the shape of the tea bag) in Blackberry Vanilla is, overall, a nice change from my usual habits.  It's not too light or fruity, but isn't too heavy.  It's a good mixture for me!<br /><br />The teabag is intriguing.  It's shaped like a mesh pyramid, which is supposed to help in brewing the tea, and allows you to see what the ingredients are.  I'm not sure if it makes a difference or not, but I haven't had a bag break on me yet, so it works in that sense.<br /><br />I suggest you give this tea a shot and this is coming from a girl who doesn't usually break from her traditional tea!

That being said if you are looking for a  "Tea with fruit flavors" this is not for you, this is a nice sweet fruit tea. I can definitely see this also being sun-brewed and served chilled.. it is a really nice and different tea!<br /><br />****<br />Jim

review/text: First the good points:  Nice idea - berry and vanilla are nice flavors.  Pyramid silk tea bags are very impressive and cool.  Box is easy to open.  The negatives: Doesn't taste much like berry or vanilla, but more like artificial flavors.  List of ingredients is a bit frigtening.  Also, for anyone concerned enough about pesticides in food to buy organics or buy from a known local souce: You have no idea where this tea is grown and what chemicals it may contain.  Something to think about.

review/text: I like this herbal tea. It contains a pleasing blend of blackberry and vanilla flavors that team up to make a soothing, delicious beverage. The pyramidal shape of the tea bag is a nice innovation -- it allows the hot water to mingle more freely with the herbs inside. I can't prove that this creates a better cup of herbal tea, but it certainly can't hurt. The box that the tea bags come in is designed to provide a pretty good seal when it is closed. This should help keep the contents fresh for some time.

review/summary: Berry Good Tea
review/text: Using vanilla as a primary flavor is a hit or miss proposition. I would have named this tea "Mixed Berry Delight" or something similar. There are multiple berries (blackberry, black currant, blueberry, raspberry,) but the vanilla flavor seems somewhat lacking. Also, vanilla is not even listed among the ingredients. I presume it falls under "natural flavors." Still, it is a flavorful tea. I would have been quite happy if they hadn't mentioned vanilla. Lipton is using an unusual tea bag shape; a pyramid.  Ostensibly this design allows greater surface area access to the ingredients within. All in all, a good herbal tea.

Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla has a wonderful, sweet fruity flavor that doesn't seem to need any enhancement (I usually take a little bit of sugar with my black teas, sometimes with my herbal and this one doesn't need any - but neither does it seem too 'sweet').  I've tried this hot, but if the temperatures were cooler this would definitely make a wonderful iced tea as it so robust.  The vanilla flavor imparts a wonderful aroma to the tea and tempers the berry tartness.  The pyramid bags helps to ensure that the tea brews well.  All in all, it's a great tea.

review/summary: Pyramid Tea Bags Make for a Quick Pleasant Tasting Cup of Tea
review/text: I drink a lot of tea, mostly regularly-flavored iced tea, but I occasionally enjoy a cup of hot tea. Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla tea, caffeine-free and made with all natural ingredients, provides a mild and pleasant-tasting cup of tea.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the pyramid-shaped tea bag. According to Lipton, this unique design "allows the real pieces of fruit, herbs, and spices to flow freely for a truly authentic tea infusion." After trying several cups of tea, I agree the water flows very freely through the bag. I let the tea bag steep for about 10 to 15 seconds in a hot cup of water and the tea is ready to drink. Remember to unravel the string, which is wrapped around the bag. Not undoing the string makes it hard for the tea bag to float freely in the cup.<br /><br />Taste wise, although Lipton is calling this blackberry vanilla tea, I didn't taste any vanilla, and vanilla is not listed in the ingredients.  Hibiscus is listed first, and that's the flavor that is most dominant, although the mix of blackberry, dried blueberry, and dried raspberry, along with other ingredients, provides for a nice, pleasing cup of tea.  It tastes good hot or over ice.<br /><br />Overall, I like Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Tea.  The name, however, is a bit of a misnomer, as vanilla is nowhere to be found, either in the ingredients or as a taste.

review/summary: Sachets make excellent tea
review/text: The flavor of Lipton's Herbal Blckberry Vanilla tea is not unique, (I've tasted other similar berry/vanilla combinations before), but it is still delicious. Strong without being bitter or tart, it is enjoyable both hot and cold. And, importantly to those of us who think tea cups can never be too large, it is powerful enough to make one very large cup, or two normal sized cups.<br /><br />Some of the flavor can likely be credited to the sachets that the tea is packaged in. Triangle shaped tea bags made out of a silken material, they have been used for years by fine tea producers, (and are not unique to Lipton, no matter their claims). They are a compromise between using loose tea and traditional tea bags. Loose tea is made with larger leaves/herbals, because they are able to spread through the water and infuse easily. Traditional tea bags are made with smaller pieces because they have less surface area that can be exposed, limiting their ability to infuse the water, and resulting in a "brisker"/sharper flavor. Sachets are a compromise between the two; the leaves/herbals are larger, resulting in less briskness, i.e. better flavor, but you still have the ease of use of a tea bag.<br /><br />Even if Blackberry Vanilla isn't for you, Lipton has got the sachets right, and I would recommend trying another in the line to see what a difference it makes to the flavor.

review/text: This is a very pleasant tea.  The blackberry flavor is the most powerful but is not too strong.  It has a very nice finish and a good aftertaste of vanilla.  The tea takes about 3 minutes to full infuse into hot water.  I tried making a second cup with the same packet...although there was still some flavor left, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the first cup (I have had some teas where the second cup is much more successful than this product).  I can't say the pyramid design of the tea bag really made that much of a difference, but it's a unique idea (and they look pretty cool).<br /><br />Overall I really like this tea and would recommend it.

review/summary: Nice berry tea in a pretty package
review/text: This is a nice berry-flavored herbal tea in which the vanilla accents but does not overwhelm the fruit. I call it "berry-flavored", though, because it does not seem distinctly blackberry. The ingredients list reads "hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, natural flavor, dried black current [sic] pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin", so do not think of this as a "blackberry" tea.<br />I sweeten my tea and thought the flavor was lovely, but my husband, who does not like to sweeten his tea, thought it was a bit sour.<br />The pyramid bag is very pretty and adds to the aesthetics of the brewing and the presentation when serving guests, but I do not see that it adds anything to the tea itself.<br />This will not replace my favorite Lipton Quietly Chamomile, but it makes a pleasant change.

I've not noticed the vanilla.<br /><br />The pyramid-shaped teabags are sorta neat, i guess, but probably not going to impress anyone unless they've been living under a rock for 10 years and you serve your tea in glass mugs.<br /><br />Taste is personal, and some people will like the flavor of this tea more than i did. My major complaint is that each tea bag is basically good for exactly one cup of tea. I drink a lot of herbal teas, and my usual method is to top off the cup with hot water when i gets too cool or too low. Most tea bags, even fruity teas, can make three or four cups worth of tea before the flavor gets too diluted or unrecognizable. With this tea, any blackberry/raspberry flavor is gone in the first cup. The color goes, too. If you drink a cup of this down 2/3 of the way, put the tea bag back in, and refill the mug with water, you'll get a pale, pale pink beverage that tastes light straight rosehips. If the tea had really spectacular flavor of the first go-around, then i'd still recommend it on flavor alone. But for a generic fruity tea, why go with this one when there are plenty of others that taste better and can last a whole morning of idle sipping?

review/summary: WOW - LIPTON HAS A WINNER HERE ! ! !
review/text: When I opened the box of these tea bags, I was amused by the cute little pyramids of tea bags! Their contents were aromatic and colorful. Upon reading the box, it was obvious that there was a lot of loving care taken in preparing these tea bags with the wonderful varied ingredients. I promptly brewed a bag and WOW - this is the best tea I have ever tasted! The purple color of the water made it inviting and when I drank some, it was really terrific! Everything in these little pyramids was delicious. And being caffeine free is a real plus as well. I sincerely will purchase several of these boxes as soon as possible and will give to guests if they want to try a tasteful new tea. I have also brewed some and put it in the fridge for iced tea - what a treat! Lipton has grabbed the new tea lover's market and offers many interesting teas to try. Get a box and sit back and enjoy!  Cudos to Lipton too.

review/summary: What *Natural Flavors* Are In This Tea??
review/text: I do like the flavor of this tea. It really tastes like blackberries. Sometimes I get herbal teas that sound good, but taste nothing like their name would imply - there are so many other stronger herbs in it. But this one tastes just like blackberries. It is slightly tart, but not much. It's a very refreshing tea, both hot and cold. I prefer it with no sugar. Although a bit of sugar seemed to bring out the vanilla flavor a bit more. It does make me wonder though, what are they using for the vanilla taste? The ingredients do not mention vanilla specifically...<br /><br />ingredients:<br />hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, **natural flavors**, dried black current, pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin<br /><br />I have been hearing that some companies are using something from beaver glands (yes, beaver) to use in food and beverages for vanilla flavoring. Vanilla beans are pricey where as beavers are apparently cheap. And it can be listed as "natural flavor" because it is nature-made, not synthetically made in a lab. I would feel much better about drinking this tea if it listed all the ingredients outright and did not use the term "natural flavors." Especially considering the name of the tea includes the word vanilla, yet there is no vanilla listed in the ingredients. For that reason, I can't say I am apt to drink any more of this. While sipping I kept thinking, beaver glands?? Really?? Possibly?? Eww!! I hope that is not the case, but I don't like thinking it could be a possibility. Lipton - if you read this, please verify. I'd love to know I am worrying over nothing.<br /><br />I hope it's more of an over-exaggerated rumor about the common use of beaver glands in food and drink. But still, it does make me get a little grossed out now when I see "natural flavoring" in anything with a vanilla taste to it anymore.<br /><br />If the ingredients listed vanilla bean instead of natural flavors, I would give it five stars for it's wonderful blackberry flavor.

review/text: Never thought I would taste-test a Lipton tea, but I am glad I did because their Blackberry Vanilla is delicious! With real pieces of blackberry, current, blueberry, raspberry and hibiscus in the bag it is just delightful and such a nice surprise. I'm assuming their "natural flavor" listed in the ingredients is vanilla because I do smell and taste it. Otherwise, everything is straight up, no chemicals, no artificial flavors, and a cool pyramid shaped teabag. Enjoy!

review/summary: tasty tea
review/text: I am already a fan/buyer of Lipton's herbal tea, having tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9PH3A">Island Mango & Peach</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PS0">the Mandarin Orange</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9PH4O">Blueberry Pomegranate</a>.<br /><br />I like the fact that the ingredients are natural - hibiscus flowers, rosehips, blackberry, blueberry, raspberry. It's definitely 'herbal' tea - there are no actual tea leaves in the ingredients (which is why it's caffeine free).<br /><br />I also like that Lipton uses the least amount of material needed to make the tea bags, and they aren't wrapped individually. (The teas that do so annoy me, as wrapped bags are a time waster and a resources waster - there's no need to wrap each one!)<br /><br />I especially like the taste of the tea - it has a very nice flavor.<br /><br />Note: I use 9 bags at a time to make a full pitcher of iced tea.

review/summary: Excellent Taste, Innovative Tea-Bag!
review/text: I was quite surprised when I opened this box of teabags to find  a new innovative "mesh" bag instead of the all familiar paper tea-bags.I would guess the mesh would help the "tea" blend with the hot water. Well, whatever it's reason, this is one delicious cup of tea. The Blackberry and Vanilla flavors make an delicious combination and it is very satisfying.<br />I did not get a pick-up from this tea as you do with coffee, black tea or other caffeinated beverages, neither did it make me feel relaxed as does Camomile. Instead I just found it to be a refreshing tasteful tea that woke up my taste buds. The aroma it gives off is also quite pleasant!<br /><br />All-in-all, a delicious hot beverage, I thoroughly enjoyed them and so did my wife. Although we tried them for the Vine program, it is a product we will likely keep buying because of its interesting taste!

review/summary: Lovely Tea
review/text: I am a tea drinker and love to try new varieties of tea. The Blackberry Vanilla from Lipton is a lovely, naturally decaf tea. I love the Pyramid tea bags and do think they make a difference when brewing herbal teas. Herbal tea (which actually contains no tea at all) generally has larger pieces of the ingredients than traditional black or green teas. The pyramid shape of the tea bag allows those pieces more room to spread through the water so the infusion of flavor is stronger.<br /><br />The Blackberry Vanilla tea is a beautiful purple color which is actually from the hibiscus not the blackberry (although I'm sure the blackberry does contribute some of the color). Despite the name the hibiscus is also the dominate flavor which is true of most herbal infusions. The blackberry and vanilla flavors are undercurrents and I wish these flavors had been a bit more prominent.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the Lipton Blackberry Vanilla tea and I'm sure it will be a variety that I will purchase in the future.

review/text: I give this tea high marks for color, aroma and flavor. With no caffeine, you can drink it any time and its rich berry flavor is very enjoyable.<br /><br />I would have gladly given this five stars except that the tea bags have some kind of plastic-y coating on them that concerns me. I don't know what it is, but it's definitely something the tea could have done without. If that kind of thing doesn't bother you, though, this is a great tea!

review/summary: The best of the Tabasco sauces
review/text: Don't misunderstand me, I really enjoy the original red Tabasco sauce and even the green jalapeno version (on burritos), but this one is my favorite. It's not only the hottest sauce Tabasco currently makes, but it is one of the best-tasting too. It goes good on most Italian foods, soups, pizza, chicken, steak, burgers...you can really just experiment. The only drawback of this sauce compared Tabasco's other offerings is the super-high sodium content. It's REALLY high! I'm not a health nut but I try to avoid eating too much sodium and/or saturated fats...the foods that this sauce tastes the best on are typically already high in sodium. Even so I continue to use this stuff almost daily. :) Too bad that the only stores that sell it locally try to charge $10 per bottle when normal Tabasco can be purchased at a supermarket for about $3 per bottle. Tabasco's sauces may not be the hottest but to me they are the best-tasting.

A 'Scoville Unit' is actually a measure of capsaicin (the chemical in hot peppers that is responsible for their heat).<br /><br />Scoville's test was a comparative taste test that is considered subjective by today's standards. A more sophisticated method is in use today, but in honor of Wilbur Scoville, the unit of measure is still called the Scoville.<br /><br />The capsaicin level in peppers can vary from plant to plant due to local environmental conditions. This means that a pepper's rating is an average measure.<br /><br />The hottest pepper on record is the Bhut Jolokia with a pungency of over 1 million Scoville Heat Units (1,001,304, to be exact). By contrast, the Bell Pepper comes in at less than 100 Scoville Heat Units."

review/summary: Tastes Amazing but Tantalizingly Hot
review/text: I love hot sauce.  I have 5 or 6 different bottles of the stuff in my fridge at any time.  I even like to buy the novelty stuff that splits your tongue open with one drip.<br /><br />This sauce has a terrific flavor.  I've added it to rice dishes, eggs and meats and it's enhanced and added to everything I've tried.  The problem is that it tastes so great I want to douse my meals with it - but it's too hot for that!!  I've ruined my enjoyment of a few meals by adding too much.<br /><br />I think it's meant for light additions to add subtle flavor.  I'd love to find the same flavor with a hotness level more like the original Tabasco so I could really flood my plate.<br /><br />Edit: I'd like to clarify that this sauce is "only" around 7k scoville which makes it a mild medium hotness to hot sauce aficionados.  Used in a traditional hot sauce role it isn't overwhelmingly hot.  I simply like to use my stuff like ketchup and cover my meals when I really like the taste (which is the case with this sauce).  Happy eating!

review/text: Tabasco has done what very few in this space have been able to manage. They have engineered a habanero elixir for the extreme palate that tastes good on just about everything, and I do mean everything.<br /><br />I've got over 50 different brands of hot sauce in my collection and this jewel from Tabasco has pretty much obsoleted all of them. It's got a mild island flavor reminiscent of a jerk/calypso sauce and it's guaranteed to make everything from bar-b-que to hamburgers to collard greens to bloody marys and even salads tastes better. It doesn't have that sting regular Tabasco has that hasn't been properly aged, but it will bite you, and it will bite you hard if you're not judicious with the amount you're pouring on. The best thing about this sauce is that is commercially available just about everywhere.<br /><br />Warning - This stuff is addictive. After a couple of weeks on this juice you'll get the "hot sauce slobbers" every time you walk through your grocery's butcher shop. Don't say I didn't warn you. 5 Scovies!

review/summary: Liquid fire for those who like it Hot.
review/text: I'm a hot sauce fanatic and Tabasco (red) is what cuts it for me at the dinner table. Forget that lame Frank's stuff. I received an awesome caddy of six flavors from Tabasco and this was one of them. Habanero is one of the hottest peppers (naturally grown) on Earth. That said, Tabasco managed to bottle it in its entirety. I can dump the red sauce on food and it's all okay until I finish and my mouth burns for a few manageable minutes. THIS sauce I put a few drops on something and that's it! It is hot, hot, hot. If you put too much on something you can literally feel your stomach burning. It has a true habanero flavor and thicker consistency than the thin, uniformity of the traditional red. For hot sauce gurus like me I suggest you try this. For wimps and amateurs, steer clear... it will bring a tear to your eye.

review/text: I *LOVE* this sauce! I think it is Tabasco's best hot sauce, but it is very hard to find in stores (unfortunately).<br /><br />The flavor profile on the Tabasco Habanero is totally different from the usual, cheap, vinegary habanero sauces that are a dime-a-dozen. The Tabasco Habanero is thicker, with a noticeable fruity flavor. Much more depth than their Original sauce. Plenty of heat is packed in each drop, but not insanely hot. A little will go a long way, depending on your heat tolerance. After 5 or 6 drops, I get a nice bit of perspiration on my forehead. As I like to say, "If you don't sweat, it ain't hot enough yet!"<br /><br />With the great flavor profile, let's just say that each bite will be memorable. :-D

review/text: For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tabasco Brand Habanero Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I do not consider to be a favorite.  Its flavor is novel and peculiar but not to my liking.  It also has a strong heat, but that is understandable since it is a habanero sauce, but it is still too hot for my liking.  I did use the entire bottle of it, though, and tried it on several food items.  Even though I am glad that I tried this hot sauce, it is not pleasing to me.

review/text: I'm sure there is a crowd out there that just isn't satisfied with regular tobasco or other standard cayanne hot sauces any more, but might hurt themselves if they walk into a shop that exclusively sells hot sauce and says "give me your hottest!"  If you are looking to take a baby step, step up to Tobasco Habanero.<br /><br />I love my hot sauce and have been know to put sauces in the 50k to 300k or higher scoville range on my food, but I keep this around to splash on my food if I need a little pep and I dont have a hotter sauce handy.  This sauce ranks in the 7k - 8k scoville range.  Since its more widely available, its a good sauce to help you spring board into other hotter sauces without having to leave the grocery store.  If you want to take a little bit bigger step without getting too burned, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DG566">Blairs Original Death Hot Sauce, 5 fl oz</a> (30k scoville).

How is it legal to make such a blatantly false claim?<br /><br />False advertising aside, I bought a bottle for thirty-five cents at my local grocer after it was on sale and had a coupon which doubled.  The moment came and I shook the bottle into my mouth for a swig..and...nothing.  Minutes later, another big swig; a third of the bottle now gone.  I waited patiently to no avail.  Maybe others would have been impressed with the hint of capsaicin, but not me.  So, thankfully I didn't pay much for this tiny bottle of disappointment.  Yes, I am a SHU snob, and if you need to look up what "SHU" is then this sauce is for you.  Even Tabasco's website, which doesn't require a recall to correct, is loaded with inaccurate [read deceitful] claims.  I've had hotter jalapenos from Domino's pizza than Tabasco's attempt at a habanero sauce.  Stick with the simple pickled red pepper juice and market your black pepper water toward the mainstream Tabasco; you're way out of your league.<br /><br />That said, this sauce is great for adding to baking soda and making cool volcanos with my kids.  Certainly not worthy of gracing my breakfast.<br /><br />But hey, this is just my opinion.  Much like Tabasco's opinion on "the world's hottest pepper"; no real merit.<br /><br />Worth noting, this is only the second time I've ever been compelled enough by a product to take the time which I have little of to share my opinion.

review/text: Someone served this at a dinner party long before I knew I should be eating gluten-free, and it was delicious - the same great taste as regular pasta but without the starchy fullness.  Now it's all I serve, even to guests, and some of them have begun eating it, although they could eat regular pasta if they desired.  This just tastes so good!  For those of us who DO have to eat gluten-free, it's a God-send.  All the pastas in this brand are just as good.  Try them!

review/text: this pasta cooks up and tastes very much like wheat pasta.  the taste is very good.  i only wish i had been able to read, or explored the ingredient list further.  even on the front of the box, that little white tag inset on the upper left green panel, says, "corn-quinoa" blend.  so if corn is not a problem for you, it should be fine.  going form wheat to corn flower is not a move in a positive direction, in my mind.  it is gluten free, so if that is your main objective, this product satisfies.

review/summary: PERFECTION in Pasta - Quinoa
review/text: I'm new to the gluten free diet, and I'm a pasta fan.  Its a staple in our house, everyweek we have it once or twice a week.  I've tried other gluten free pastas, and they are ok IF you eat them all as soon as you cook it.  If you want to reheat it it would turn to mush.  I stumbled upon the Quinoa brand pastas and fell in love with pasta again.<br /><br />This pasta not only stands up to bold flavors, but to reheating as well.  While its more expensive than I would have liked, its made pasta an option again so it's worth the extra cost.<br /><br />I would recommend skipping the "time method" of cooking, as I've found I need my noodles cooked a couple minutes longer than the box suggests so i've switched to the taste it method.<br /><br />My gluten eating family prefers the consistancy of this pasta to its wheat based counter parts.  Its a hardier noodle and it seems (to me) to be more filling.  While the box sizes are generally 1/2 a pound vs the full pound you get with wheat pasta you actually get away with making less pasta and it going just as far.<br /><br />The other varieties of this pasta are equally good, I'm a happy pasta eater again.

review/summary: From the protein content point of view...
review/text: I bought this, not for its gluten-free feature, but because I though the protein content would be high.  Quinoa is known for its really high protein content. However, a word of caution (probably my fault that i did not read the finer print properly) but this is a corn-quinoa mix.  My usual whole grain pasta actually has 75% more protein and 50% more fiber than this quinoa pasta. So really I regret buying it. However, taste wise, it's similar enough to wheat pasta but does not keep the tight neat shape of regular rotelle. I think it would be nice for those bound to a gluten-free diet.

review/summary: The best Gluten Free Pasta you can buy
review/text: Ancient Harvest's pasta line is about as good as it gets for store bought dry pasta. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTBDQ">elbows</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTBA4">shells</a> have too much corn in them and can start to dissolve into the water or sauce very easily. The rotelle, however, hold up very well and are great not only in thick sauces but as a replacement for elbows in any mac and cheese or casserole dish. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTB90">spaghetti</a> noodles are better than most wheat pasta brands(I'm not the one who's gluten free around here and I still use them over wheat pasta.) The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKWSG8">pagodas</a> are also good but will usually get crunchy again when they cool off.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is the best gluten free brand out and this is the style you want if you need something other than long noodles.

review/summary: Holds up well in dishes
review/text: With gluten free pasta there are two issues you usually have to combat. 1) the noodles being slimy which is mostly found with rice based pastas 2) the pasta gets hard in pasta salads after it sits for a day. This product has neither problem, my non gluten free friends even prefer this pasta to wheat pasta, and no one will know its gluten free unless you tell them. I use the rotelle mostly in chicken noodle soup and it holds up very well. One suggestion though is to keep the pasta separate from the soup until you are ready to eat it or the pasta will fall apart. The protein and nutritional benefit of this product leaves me to wonder why you would ever use something else!

I have eliminated this trial by error to Quinoa products, I have found them to be the best so far. Red Mill Rolled Oats are very good. Udi's white sandwich bread is the best so far, makes a really good grilled cheese and toast.<br /><br />I am doing a lot of home cooking, using Pantry flour, it is great. Gluten free Bisquick is great. I have been released from the specialist as he understands that I am being extremely careful and adjusting to my life changing diet.<br /><br />I am going to try Udi's hamburger buns next.

You just can't overcook this, seriously, we cook this 5 minutes more than recommended and the pasta still holds it's shape and not go mushy.  We already use the other pasta shapes.  One recommendation is to make sure you use a lot of water to cook the pasta.  Yes, the water will run a ydeep yellow-maize colour, but don't panic, it is fine.  Just remember to cook in a lot of water.  Great for people who is seeking GF food as I have benefited from it.  Note that quinoa is a protein and hence it is a lot better for you too.  I think this pasta will explode in sale like almond milk!  Great price here in Amazon!

review/text: I was excited to be able to purchase Ancient Harvest Quinoa Rotelle from Amazon. I've been on the program for heart health developed by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn.  It's a vegan program that recommends eating nothing that "had a mother" or "has a face."  I live in Mexico and it's not always easy to find quinoa or products made from quinoa, one of the healthiest foods on the planet.  I can occasionally find whole wheat pasta, but I'd rather use pasta made from quinoa because it's much healthier.

review/text: I'm happy to recommend this product. My older daughter who has celiac disease was a pasta nut before her diagnosis, and Ancient Harvest's corn-quinoa pasta is just about the best boil-and-serve GF pasta we've found. It stands up well to sauce, reheats nicely, and can even tolerate a few minutes of overcooking. Our non-GF younger daughter, who eats wheat pasta at school, scarfs this down at home without complaint. I've noticed that the bulk-order boxes contain more pasta fragments than the full-price boxes at the health food store, but the Amazon price is unbeatable. The reason the rating is four stars instead of five is that one batch contained multiple boxes that weren't sealed perfectly.

review/summary: GLUTEN FREE!  So good, I had to review it!
review/text: BOTTOM LINE:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  This stuff was sooo good, I really wish I had another bowl right now. The Quantity:Price ratio takes the product down one star.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I thought the flavor was excellent, in that I could really taste the garlic, pepper, and onions.  The broth was a little salty at first, but I added a bit more water to get it to where I wanted.  I also thought it could use a little spiciness, but I feel that way about everything (I left out their oil packet and added a squirt of my own Hot Chili Sesame Oil - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZXXWM">House of Tsang Hot Chili Sesame Oil</a> and it was perfect).  It was really nice in that it had more than just your standard chicken/ msg broth flavor - it had real subtle flavor notes.<br /><br />NOODLES:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  I thought I would note that I really like the noodles in this - they are not your standard Ramen noodle, but are a form of rice noodle, similar to Vietnamese Pho.  These take a little longer to cook, but are definitely a great match for the broth.  I bought them because they are gluten free, but they make a great soup noodle in their own right.<br /><br />QUANTITY vs. PRICE:<br />I wish there was more in the bowl than what was provided.  This is what takes the product from 5 stars down to 4.  For the price, I wish there was more food - or for the amount of food, I wish it was cheaper.  To be fair, I bought this at my supermarket, and not on here, but the price is similar.

review/summary: Not exactly what I expected.
review/text: I have been drinking Young Hyson for some time now. I normally get it from a bulk supply in California. My wife drinks a dark and very rich Yorkshire black tea that I can only get here on Amazon. Needing some green tea for myself I found this brand and figured I would give it a try. In reading the description I saw the area it showed to come from and thought that didn't seem right. True Young Hyson or Sleeping Dragon comes from a island off China in the Anhui Provence. This listing shows the tea to come from Sri-Lanka. An area that is not so common for green teas. Young Hyson is a very wonderful, bold and sweet tea and is hard to replicate.<br />When receiving a good supply of Young Hyson it looks like very full leafs that are slightly twisted. It brews at a temperature just below boiling for 2-4 minutes. You will find a very amazing taste that is satisfying to the last drop.<br /><br />My review of this tea: In opening this tea I find all broken and or what I would call sifted leaf. None are full leafs that I have found so far. There are also a small amount of stems included in the mix. This would be graded in a level of the lowest grade of the scale.<br />It steeps up and fills my infuser nicely.<br />The taste is nice, not really bad but there is a bit more bite than I am use to for Young Hyson. It seems to taste closer to Gun Powder tea or have a hint of.<br /><br />My normal supplier is Monterey Bay spice company. There description is very close and reads as follows (Young Hyson is a type of green tea, defined by how it is processed and the age of its leaves. Off the eastern coast of China, on the island of Taiwan, young green tea leaves are harvested and twisted into long threads. With a name meaning "before the rains," this tea produces a golden cup that is full-bodied and, due to the young leaves, possessing a hint of natural sweetness.)<br />There prices are very close to this price with a little less cost per pound. The shipping is where it makes it more expensive.<br />Considering they give a higer quality for less I would say there shipping fees would be worth it if you really want the better taste.<br /><br />In conclusion I like this tea and it does taste nice. It just does not seem to fit the description they have listed. It clearly says it is 100% Young Hyson tea but the location it comes from does not match the true origin of where Young Hysop originates. With it being all broken leaf there is not even any appearance that would show it to have been twisted as it should look. Does not have the look as it should.<br />Maybe there is a reason for the differences but they should do a bit of explaining. Could just be an entry error for the listing but it turns out for me to be deceiving and disappointment in finding the sack full of broken tea leaf.  Even a photo of the loose leaf would have been enough for me to know what I should expect.<br /><br />Maybe I will be back and maybe I wont.<br />It makes better customers when you get a good deal that looks exactly as you expect. I dont want to run people off but if this is what they are offering I can assure you there are better qualities of this tea elsewhere. If you dont care for the look it is a good tasting green tea.<br />I also ordered a sack of the same brand of Gun Powder green tea. I also still have some of the same type of tea from another supplier. I am really hoping it turns out to be as described because Gun Powder tea is all rolled into tiny nuggets. I will not be very happy to see another bag full of sifted pieces of leaf.

review/text: Seriously.  It tastes like the vanilla filling you get from a breakfast danish.  What it does not taste like is authentic hollandaise sauce.

review/summary: Quick, easy, and tasty
review/text: Couldn't be easier- dump the packets in the container together, pop it in the microwave for two minutes, remove, stir and eat - it even comes with it's own spork!  I thought the flavor was very nice, and the quantity is sufficient to serve as a quick lunch that is much more satisfying than a cup of soup, but keeps just as well in the cupboard!

review/summary: something is wrong!
review/text: I have purchased these T discs many times and there is something wrong with this last order.  Does anyone else have the problem of the discs only making 3/4 of a cup?  It's not my machine because any other brand turns out fine.  I bought another package from a retail store and the same thing is happening!  For the money that these discs cost, this is unacceptable.  I bought a whole case!!!

review/summary: Exactly what it aims to be
review/text: For anyone who simply wants a basic, American-style cup of coffee, this is perfectly fine. No, it's not as full-flavored or (arguably) as good as most of the higher priced Tassimo offerings, but it isn't intended to be. This is a simple, inexpensive cup for everyday use.<br /><br />That said, I knocked off a star due to Amazon's current pricing. The unit price for the "Friday Sale" is roughly the same as the individual retail price at many stores. That's not a deal -- and certainly doesn't represent the sort of discount one would expect to receive when buying a 5-pack.

review/text: The coffee is excellent the price great. After my K cup took a dive I gave the T-disc a try Wow. It was better than any of the K-cup brands I had. The only unfortunate draw back is you can't seem to get the T-disc in stores. Good thing Amazon has them at a good price.

review/summary: Good old fashioned coffee taste
review/text: When I come down the stairs in the morning, and the kids are "making coffee" I smell the great aroma of the original Maxwell House coffee that I grew up with. When I get to the kitchen, I have a great cup of coffee, with no mess and no waste. The coffee disc's are expensive, but there is no "day old" coffee left sitting in the pot. This coffee is nothing fancy, not too strong, and taste good every time I fix a cup.

review/summary: Good basic coffee
review/text: As the title says, this is a good basic cup of coffee.  We feel a little frustrated by the 6 ounce default pour - does anyone still drink coffee in these lilliputian quantities? Still, with a little time spent pressing the "give me more" button, we can get a nice full cup of medium bodied coffee. We generally alternate cups between this and Gevalia Vanilla Hazelnut on the weekends.

review/summary: It's Terrible.
review/text: Do you remember what it smells like to add water to an ashtray full of cigarettes? That's how this coffee tastes. I added a caramel, some hazelnut flavoring, a packet of hot chocolate with miniature marshmellows, and Coffeemate vanilla chai creamer too it. It still tasted bitter, like wet cigarettes and metallic. I think the metallic flavor comes from the t-disc packaging. It doesn't make sense to buy a $100 coffee maker and drink trashy coffee. Especially when you can take that same amount of cash and buy some good coffee. I ignored the bad ratings of other reviewers because I believed the positive reviews. The only redeeming factors are that it is cheaper (less than $7 at Walmart), and that you can make a single cup of coffee. If it were allowed, I'd give it a -5 rating (or &lt;-> -,  for infinitly horrible).

review/summary: Great Flavor Even fooled meat eaters
review/text: Based on reviews online for vegan snacks, I tried this particular flavor and love them. Great snack for the road. They are mostly Wheat gluten in case you want to limit your soy intake. My friends who eat animals loved them also. I didn't mention what they were made of until they were finished eating them and asked. Nice chewy texture. These travel well. They have 10 Gms of protein in case you are asked "where do you get your protein?" I plan on trying another flvor.

review/text: These things are great - I discovered them at Whole Foods and now I can get them even cheaper here at Amazon with quick shipping to boot. These are great for traveling, hiking/outdoors stuff, and to bring to work for a snack. They don't need to be refrigerated, and they're vegan as well! They're made of wheat gluten, which is very high protein. I like the thai peanut flavor the best - I've tried BBQ and teriyaki and I don't like them as much.
