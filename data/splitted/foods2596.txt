review/summary: My pups really like them!
review/text: Both my Maltese and Chiweenie pup really dig these greenie's. I break the teenies in half for the chiweenie to spare the money.  Just like the people food, the healthier, the more pricey. But they do like these and would rather the greenies than anything else. 2nd time purchasing from here and shipment is quick and easy.

review/summary: My Boxer's favorite treat!
review/text: My dog has a very sensitive stomach and this is the only treat that agrees with her.  She gets one a day which I use to coax her onto her crate in the morning.  She saves the Greenie until I return home in the afternoon, like it's her treat for being such a good girl all day.  So funny!

review/summary: Only thing my dog will eat.
review/text: I have a 3 year old Siberian Husky, who has to be the pickiest dog in the world. He will go days without eating if I don't give him exactly what he wants. I must have 15-20 bags of different treats that he turns his nose up at (Busy bones, busy rollhides, busy granola, biscuits, chicken jerky treats, etc.) Greenies are the ONLY thing I can give him that I know for a fact he will eat. In fact, Siberian Huskies rarely if ever bark, but if I even go near him while he's chewing on the greenie he'll starting barking at me.. and well trying to take it away is another story. These things are EXPENSIVE, but it is cheaper in the long run than paying $10 for a bag of treat where he'll have 1 or 2 and be done.

review/text: My dog has been eating these after his dinner for years. They keep his breath clean and limit the build up of plac. He waits with anticipation his greenie after his meal, running to get one out of my hand. Digestion has been no problem at all and the formula is soft enough to prevent any form of choking. I would highly recommend this product.

review/text: Greenies are wonderful, my dog loves them and chews them up! I don't notice much as far as better breath, but I already brush his teeth and scale them. He gets 1 greenie each night for a snack :)<br /><br />(To the bad reviews/comments...if your dog is one to scarf treats and does not chew things up before swallowing, these are not a good idea! If your dog enjoys the chewing and gnawing, make sure you get the proper size for your dog so they do not choke. Also giving these to puppies can upset their stomache, hints the diarhhea comment previously)

review/summary: Works well but too dense
review/text: My dog likes to chew it but it's "heavy weight" even for this petite size. It's almost like 1/2 of her lunch. But it's very safe to use--my dog got choked often when she was chewing the rawhides or pig ears but never had problem with this one. Howwever, it's quite thick and dense. Wish they could make the shape flat and thin, that way, it will provide longer chewing and more fun. My 50lb dog consumes it in less than 20 seconds. She got a pack of Trixie Dentafun Kauchips 100g made in Germany from my best friend. The Trixie Chews are superior than ANY existing dog dental chews in the US market. But unfortunately, we don't have it here.

review/text: My dog won't chew rawhides or any bone really, I've tried them all. After spending $350 to get his teeth cleaned, and getting 15 teeth pulled due to decay, I was on a mission to find something he'd chew on to help clean his teeth. He LOVES these!He's around 12 lbs.  I think the bones are a little on the small side, so next time I'll go up a size, so it'll last longer.

review/summary: My Dog Goes CRAZY!!
review/text: I don't write too many reviews, but I read them all the time...so I though it was high time I wrote a review for this product (my dog told me to).  I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out.

review/text: I have three terriers and most often foster another dog. My dogs will do ANYTHING for a Greenie. One races through agility, because a Greenie awaits him at the end of the class--in addition to small treats after each run.  Right now I am fostering a traumatized little poodle who feared his crate; a Greenie at the back of the crate and he will quickly go in. And Greenies are good for their breath/teeth, healthy and easily digestible. My vet, too, recommends them.

review/text: My dog goes crazy when I mention the word Greenies.  He hasn't put on any extra weight since I have been giving them to him.  He gets one per day and always lets me know when it is time to have one.  The cost is a little high so I buy them in the larger quantity.

review/summary: #1 dog treat!
review/text: These are our dog's absolute favorite treat!  As recommended, we only give one each day and make sure he doesn't get choked.  These are not as tough to chew as the old formula, which took him longer to chew.  Greenies are supposed to help clean dogs' teeth and breath, but we buy them because he loves them so much.  The large box of Teenie size has 96, so they aren't that expensive at one a day.  Well worth the price for our loyal baby!  He's been enjoying them for several years with no problems.  Be sure to get the correct size so your dog can't gobble them whole.

review/text: My two babies just LOVE this product - they cannot get enough.  They usually get their treat just before bedtime.  When they know the time is nearing, they sit on the bed and anxiously await their bedtime treat.  Although the bones are small, I cut each bone into four pieces so they think they are getting multiple bones.  This item is a win win for my little ones!!

review/text: Dogs LOVE Greenies!  They go crazy if they even think they hear the greenie bag...my tiny little Italian Greyhound girl gets a greenie at bedtime, and sometimes she starts pushing us to go to bed and getting wild and begging to go to bed, because she wants her greenie.  You do have to be careful and only feed them one a day of their size range, or they will upset their stomach...you can have too much of a good thing, but as long as you don't overdo it, the dogs love them, and it's a great treat for them!

review/text: My dog eats a greenie a day and we were very excited to have found them here at such a great price.  The package arrived in perfect condition and they are very fresh.  I have chosen this size Greenie for my chihuahhua, who is approximately 12 pounds.  It has proven to be effective for us, though through time I still notice some tartar buildup on the very back teeth (molars).  Therefore, I am sure to still brush them frequently.  He loves the taste and has been eating them for about a year and a half.

I Spent A Lot Of Time Checking Prices From All The Different Sellers And Found That These Ones Were The Cheapest. I Ended Up Getting 2 Boxes For The Same Price That I Would Have Paid For 1 Box At The Pet Store.<br />The Package Arrived Very Quickly & We Even Recieved A Free Sample Size Bag Of Dog Food, Which Was An Unexpected Bonus. The Only Issue I Had Was I Feel They Could Have Put Everything In A Smaller Shipping Box. Other Then That We Are Extremely Satisfied & So Is Our Sweet Little Pom. Thank You Amazon!

review/summary: Does what it supposed to
review/text: I don't know about others, but my dog loves these.  He's a 55lbs golden retriever mix puppy, and loves to chew.  Like a reviewer before me said, this product is like crack for dogs!  The chews don't leave a mess, they occupy my dog for a couple of minutes, clean his teeth and they get rid of bad breath.  A lot of chews are either messy or leave him with bad breath -- or both.  No digestion problems either, like rawhide can cause.  He did have a problem once with a rawhide chew that got us worried - I presume that's the compressed product related problem that a previous reviewer mentioned.  This never happened with the Greenies as they mostly melt away rather than break off in pieces, unlike rawhide.  As far as I can tell, this is a great product.

I tried a couple of teeth whitening treats and toys, but Bailey would have nothing to do with them.  Then I found Greenies and she loves them.  Once she left a couple puddles of saliva on the floor as I was getting out a greenie for her, she was salivating so much.  Her teeth look so much better now and her breath is great.

review/summary: My dog would do anything for Greenies
review/text: My dog absolutely loved Greenies. He would come downstairs every morning and sit in front of the pantry until someone gave him his Greenies. He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day. Once I discovered Greenies, I cut all the other treats out and really only have him the Greenies. The 27oz. tub was in my opinion a really good value for the money so I would always buy that size. I highly recommend this product for all dogs.

review/text: Superb business.  I do not think this item could have been shipped and received any quicker unless I had driven to a local store and picked it up myself.  Wish all Internet businesses would strive to do transaction this way.  Adds confidence and credibility to the e-commerce world.

review/summary: Best deal on Greenies
review/text: Most dogs LOVE Greenies, and they are supposed to be great for their teeth, but they are also quite expensive. I found this 96 count package on Amazon for under 25.00!!!! Note that this is the petite size as I have little dogs, so if you are looking for the larger Greenies you need to check the pricing. The product arrived within a couple of days, and is a great value. Normally a package of 6 or so petite Greenies cost aprox 7.00!

review/summary: Great Price and My dog just loves 'em!
review/text: My Mom and Dad loved the price, and I just think these are way yummy. Keep 'em coming I say! As for delivery time, they ordered them and we had them in a box within a few days. Not quite as fast as the pet store, but they say for less money - even with shipping. Personally, I need them more frequently than my parents give them to me, please can I have another greenie, I love minty fresh breath! I'll be good! by Alex a Vizsla

review/summary: Papillions Love Greenies!
review/text: Our Papillions love Greenies!  They help keep the tartar under control.  This breed is notorious for bad tartar build up on their teeth and having to have dentals twice a year.  With using the Greenies daily, they only have to have a dental once a year.  This saves us over $400/year.

review/text: My dog loves the Greenies. He is a 12lbs pug and the Tiny size were too small for him.  These are a better size for him.  He loves them.  He recently decided that he didn't like many of his treats but he still loves these.

review/summary: Yummy and Good-for-you, Too!
review/text: These treats occupy my dogs (quietly!) while they clean their teeth at the same time. The first time I tried them, I bought the large ones to cut in half so I'd get more for my money, but believe me, it was definitely NOT worth the hassle. They are very hard and hard to cut. The "Regular" size is perfect for my 50-65 lb. dogs.

review/summary: Bad for My Dog
review/text: My dog was on a bland diet (boiled chicken & rice) so his poop was usually solid but a few days after eating 1 Greenie a day, his poop became more liquid-y and green. Not sure if Greenies was actually the cause until I googled and read on various dog forums about how Greenies have affected other dogs. Stopped giving out my dog Greenies and have thrown them away. BEWARE, Greenies CAN be bad, so watch your dog after giving them out.

review/text: Not the best product for the price. I got these for my dog that has plaque problems but I haven't really seen any improvement since we got them. They are okay to give as a treat but as far as helping with plaque I don't think they work at all.

review/summary: Contradicting photo and description!
review/text: There is contradicting information.  The description says Senior Greenie Large, while the photo shows "regular" as well as 27 treats versus 27 ounce.  Anyone that reviews and can clarify the actual product would be much appreciated.
