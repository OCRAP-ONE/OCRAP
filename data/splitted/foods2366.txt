review/text: My little Westie, Benji,  was having heartburn, diarrhea, and upset stomach issues for quite a few months. He would throw up almost daily. We took him to an Internest who recommended we feed him a kibble containing only two ingredients before we proceed with other tests. This is one of the kibbles she suggested. It was in two days that his vomiting and diarrhia stopped.  I highly recommend this product. Thank you Natural Balance.

review/summary: Very good yet affordable dog food
review/text: Natural Balance Duck and Potato is a great dog food, especially if you want to (or have to) get your dog on a grain-free diet.  When I stumbled upon this on Amazon, I couldn't believe 1. Amazon sells dog food, 2. the price here is A LOT cheaper than at any pet store (store or online), and 3. free shipping!!! Had I known sooner, I could've saved $$ and trips to the store.  If you're wondering, every bag I buy here, as soon as I get it, I check the expiration date and it's always good (as in you have same amount time til exp.date like those bags from the pet store).  The small bites version is also so much friendlier to my little dog's little mouth.

review/text: I have 2 small dogs (8 pound maltipoo and 15 pound pomston).  Both have their own set of health issues/allergies and I had a hard time finding a food that both dogs did well on, was healthy for them and they actually liked.  We found it with natural balance!  The small bites are much easier for them to eat and they have been on this faithfully for 2 years - both are doing great on it!  Their coats are shiny and no tummy issues at all.

review/summary: Amazing how much the size of the bite impacts its appeal!
review/text: My Shih Tzu, Missy, had pretty bad tummy problems (vet says food allergies) for the first two years after I adopted her in 2008.  Then I discovered Natural Balance products...specifically the limited ingredient and allergy formula products. Since switching Missy over to all ltd ingredient/allergy formula food and treats, her stomach issues have drastically reduced to the point where it is now occasional and manageable.<br /><br />Missy has been eating Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Fish for some time, but recently I discovered this "small breed bites" bag in our local pet store and decided to give that a try (Missy tends to like treats and food in small bites).  WOW, what a difference.  It was a food she already liked...the exact same brand and flavor...the only difference was the size of the dog food pieces...and yet she attacked it with a fervor I could not believe.<br /><br />More often than not now, she eats ALL her food...not just grazing off the top.  This morning, I was happy to find the small breed bites variety on Wag.com, and have already ordered a bag, along with some of the other great Natural Balance products Missy loves (and I love for her).<br /><br />Recommended!

So we switched the protein and the carb by going to this food; and he has been eating and playing and getting in trouble just like he should be ever since - big or small size kibbles - he manages either just fine.

review/summary: Westie with allergies
review/text: We have a westie that has allergies and had spent a lot of money going to the vet. She had ear infections and she was licking/biting her paws. We looked on a lot of westie blogs and even ordered special dog supplements. We eventually ended up mading her dog food for several months with ground beef and dog supplements (which was a pain to do).<br /><br />After going through several brands of holistic dog food brands, we finally found THE one! We love how she doesn't react to Natural Balance's duck and potato. I haven't tried the other flavors and I'm afraid to. Why change a good thing right? I don't really write reviews, but I wanted to write this to any pet owner who is tired of spending money going to the vet and stressed at watching their dog to food and skin allergies.  I would highly recommend this brand if your dog is having allergies.

When my brother's girlfriend recommended Natural Balance and gave us a couple of sample packs, my dogs loved them!  I went online and ordered the Duck and Potato kibbles (small breed bites).

review/summary: Working well for my pup with food allergies.
review/text: We have had a sweet little mutt (Italian greyhound/terrier mix) for about 6 years now. We always thought she just had a sensitive stomach, since she would throw up occasionally. Recently, she had a bout where she couldn't keep her food down for several days in a row. When we took her to the vet, we discovered that she had a food allergy.<br /><br />The vet recommended first that we try Blue Buffalo. We did, and gave her stomach time to adjust, but she still had some issues with it. We were about to try the prescription food with her, but I decided to search Amazon for "low allergen dog food." I poked around a bit and happened upon the Natural Balance foods, which had lots of glowing reviews from others with allergy-afflicted pups. I am happy to report that this food has worked wonders for our girl. She hasn't vomited in quite a while, and the sores she had on her back from the reaction to the previous food are all but gone. We are so happy that we don't have to mess with the prescription food, and the small bites are easy for my teeny tiny chihuahua to eat. We're very pleased with the food, and very happy that (with Prime) Amazon will ship it with two day shipping for free. As we are in the process of moving and our new location doesn't have a retailer for Natural Balance, that's a real life-saver. We'll continue to use this food for the foreseeable future.

review/summary: Dog Ate For A Couple of Weeks & Then Did Not Want To Eat It!
review/text: I have a 7 month old (today 09-15-12) maltese and she is a very picky eater. I have bought several different types of dry dog food and she will eat it for awhile and then eats enough to get by on until I try another brand. I read the reviews that others had finicky eaters too and that they had tried this dog food and their dogs just loved it...so I thought I would give it a try. I reaaly hate that I bought the larger bag with its cost because it will be another bag to go to the vets office to give to a dog that someone has found abandoned and brought to them. I want to continue to give her dry dog food because I want her teeth to stay pretty and strong for a longer period of time. Does someone out there know what I can do about my finicky eater??? The box that Amazon shipped it in was not right size and the bag came ripped in several places. I only rate this a 3 star because I have not ate it and my dog seem to like it for a little while like all the other brands she has tried.

review/summary: I'm rating the product 5 stars. Deliver service 0 stars.
review/text: I found out my dog is a finicky eater. I bought a small bag of the duck and potato flavor at Petco because it was on sale. Well, my dog loved it more that the other Natural Balance flavors and when it came time to buy another bag NB wasn't on sale so I just got something cheap thinking he'd eat anything. No. Not the case. He barely touched the stuff and so I decided to check online for a better price. Thankfully, Amazon has great prices and I was able to get a good deal. The order was fulfilled quickly but the deliver service blew it. Even with the correct address on the package, it was left on the doorstep of someone down the street. Lucky for me, a sweet elderly woman who got the package by mistake, dragged it to my place. How sweet is that? The delivery service was Ontrac. Without a doubt, they are the worst! I had another Amazon product that was delivered thru Ontrac and they took 5 attempts to find the place. I had to call their customer service after the second attempt and had the rep look up the address. He saw that the location was easy to find: a main street and corner house. But still the delivery guy couldn't locate it. What? It ended up being one week overdue. Luckily that gift wasn't in a hurry to get there. Long story short...Hello Amazon, are you reading this?...DON'T EVER USE ONTRAC DELIVERY SERVICE!!!! Anyway, back to my review of the product. Not wanting to waste any of the other dry dog food, I mixed it in with the Natural Balance. He spit out the pieces of the "other brand" and ate the Natural Balance. He LOVES the Potato and Duck formula! His favorite of all the flavors. So five stars for the product. ZERO stars for the Ontrac delivery service.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods RECALLED
review/text: Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

review/summary: Delicious English cookies
review/text: I don't know if there are any available elsewhere in the USA, but certainly where we live, there's nothing that's quite like a malted milk cookie (which is a shame, as they're delicious).  Moos are only one of several of these kinds of cookies from England, but they're a cute one, and the way that these are set into six little packages helps to keep them fresh!  If you like the taste of malt, these are definitely worth a try.<br /><br />I'd add two comments, though.  Firstly, because these come from England (and because import foods usually come across on shipping containers that can take a while), there wasn't much time left before they expired.  However, I've had these cookies before, and I've had a lot of luck with keeping them frozen -- kept in the freezer, they'll last far beyond their expiry date.  And secondly, for some reason, the large bag was sealed over the top of the edges of some of the little bags, so if you opened the main bag with scissors, there's a good chance you'd accidentally open up one or two of the bags inside, too.  Open with care!

review/text: I have been crock-potting food for my elderly dog for over a year now.  She had stopped eating almost all foods we tried, except the lean meat, sweet potatoes and broccoli that I would slow cook over a day.  Now, I have finally found a stew that she likes more than the crock pot stew.  She literally would eat 3 times the recommended daily portions of this food if I would let her.  And if I mix it in with dry food, she stealthily removes the wet from the dry leaving a bowl of dried nuggets behind.  I feel really good about the nutritional content of this food, but most of all... my dog LOVES it!!  I just wish it weren't so pricey.  That is my ONLY complaint!

review/summary: Every can is dented
review/text: Merrick's Senior Medley and Grammy's Pot Pie canned dog food is the ONLY food my dog, who has a history of pancreatitis, can eat.  I used to buy it at a local major pet chain but then saw it on Amazon for less so thought it was a great candidate to purchase via subscription (two cases per month of Senior Medley).  However, I recently received my first two cases, and every can in the first case I opened was dented.  Didn't think too much about it, but then I just opened the second case and every can is also dented.  There is a red sticker with a number on the top of each case wrapping -- wonder if that is a flag that the product is a second or reject.  You can tell by the nature of the dents and that the "inside" cans are also dented that they were not dented in shipment.  Shipping packaging was excellent.  I would like to think that the food is safe, but do not want to take a chance so will not purchase it in the future from Amazon.<br /><br />I buy as much as I possibly can from Amazon (lawnmower included!) and this is the first product disappointment I have had.<br /><br />UPDATE October 1, 2012:  Amazon has resolved the issue to my satisfaction.  Great customer service.  Thank you.

If you add cream and sugar you'll add a great deal less.  There is no messing with filters and coffee grounds.  The cool brew packaging containers have a built-in measuring device.  Squeeze the bottle, pour the now pre-measured brew into your cup, add water, zap in microwave until hot.  Takes about 2-mins.  So convenient and tastes smooth . . . certainly worth a try.

review/text: This stuff is pretty great. I read it about it first in the New York Times that cool brew was the real deal. The added shipping cost kind of blows, but it's a superior product that still ends up costing less than an $1 a day. It's quick to make and I bought a plastic cup with a lid and straw and used when I was on the go.

review/summary: Mocha is not very mocha.
review/text: I had high hopes for this cool brew coffee.  Yes, it is low in acid and very smooth.  However,<br />the mocha flavor was almost non-existent, and I had to add sugar to make it sweet.  So, the<br />"easy" cup of iced mocha coffee I was hoping for was not so easy, once I had to add chocolate<br />and sugar.  I'd return it, but the shipping was more than the cool brew.  So, I'm stuck with<br />it.

review/summary: Red sludge
review/text: I bought a few bottles after sampling in the store. Flavor is surprising, considering it's made of coffee berries. Flavor actually reminds me of prune juice. Not bad. Problem is that two of my bottles had this sludgy residue that made me want to gag -- literally it was one of the most awful textures ever. I had shaken the bottle very well, too, and I can tell you that no amount of shaking in the world would have broken up that blob of sludge. I actually thought maybe some of the bottle had melted, as it looked like liquid plastic. Anyway, I tried another bottle and it was fine, but the next one had more of this stuff, so at that point I was done with kona red. Maybe it was a bad batch, but it wasn't good enough for me to keep going back.

review/text: I wanted to order these chocolates as a gift for a co-worker, so I thought I'd order a box for myself to check the quality. I was very, very pleased! The chocolates arrived exactly as pictured, and the selection was really nice. A guide sheet is included that tells you which chocolate is which along with a brief description of the flavors. (I'm constantly surprised by how few chocolate collections include this information.)<br /><br />My personal favorites are the praline and the raspberry; happily, you get two of each of these truffles. To further expand on the product description, here's an overview of the assortment:<br />*Dark Ephemere (2)--Creamed bittersweet truffle in bittersweet chocolate<br />*Hazelnut Gianduia (1)--Milk chocolate truffle with hazelnut butter in double cream milk chocolate<br />*Cointreau (1)--Bittersweet truffle with orange liqueur in bittersweet chocolate<br />*Kahlua (1)--Milk chocolate with Kahlua in milk chocolate<br />*Madame X (1)--Milk chocolate anise truffle with Pernod in white chocolate<br />*Champagne Truffle Romanov (1)--Semisweet truffle with marc de champagne and strawberry essence in double cream milk chocolate<br />*Raspberry (2)--Semisweet truffle with raspberries in semisweet chocolate<br />*Light Ephemere (1)--Creamed semisweet truffle in milk chocolate<br />*Napoleon (1)--Semisweet truffle with Mandarin orange brandy in milk chocolate dusted with cocoa<br />*Mocha (1)--Bittersweet truffle with Turkish-grind coffee in bittersweet chocolate<br />*Praline (2)--White chocolate truffle with crushed pralines in white chocolate<br />*Amaretto (1)--Milk chocolate truffle with almond liqueur in milk chocolate<br />*Ginger (1)--Semisweet truffle with New Zealand ginger in bittersweet chocolate<br /><br />In short, this set is definitely worth every penny.

Gluten free is new for our family after my daughter was diagnosed with having an allergy to gluten. Since then we've been on the hunt for what works for us...sadly, a lot of products don't. This pancake & waffle mix however was an enthusiastic hit with my large family of 7, even with the skeptical, Non-GF members of our family! We love to make crepes with it and they truly come out perfect every time! The mix is also bolstered with a lot of additional nutrition that you won't find in some of your GF mixes, and there's a perfect sweetness to the batter that will have you re-considering if you even need syrup or additional toppings. :D

review/text: This is the BEST "jerk" seasoning around!  Forget the dry rubs and the jerk "sauces".  This seasoning is so flavorful you DON'T need a lot!!!  A little too much and you feel the "heat".  Use 1/2 teaspoon rubbed on a steak, chicken or pork is all you need!! A jar lasts forever.  You can also use it as a marinade by mixing some with more oil (instead of rubbing it on directly) but personally I think that's wasteful.  Rub it on, grill it, bake it, anyway you do it you'll LOVE IT!

I was somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />I prepared jerk chicken as described on the jar by taking a few spoonfuls of the jerk rub and combining a little oil, and marinated two chicken breasts for several hours in a plastic zip bag.  I cooked the chicken on a grill.<br /><br />It was an OK sauce but I was expecting more.  I'm no where close to being an authority on jerk sauce but any time I have eaten jerk spice in restaurants the dish has been pretty spicy hot.  This sauce is not (even though many reviewers think it is).<br /><br />I'll use the rest of the jar, but won't buy it again.

review/text: I love to use this to make jerk-spiced chicken wings. Marinate chicken wings in this seasoning together with raw thinly-sliced onions, then scrape off the onions, grill the chicken wings (strategically using the cover of the grill to give them a smokier flavor), caramelize the onions separately in a skillet, and serve together. It's a bit of work, but makes a magnificent dinner, especially paired with sauteed okra and cucumber-dill salad or raita. The spiciness can be adjusted depending on how much of the seasoning you use in the marinade, so experiment until you find out just how you like it. The flavors are rich and intense, especially if you succeed in grilling the chicken just right so that it's crispy on the outside but tender and juicy within.<br /><br />I was alarmed when I moved last year and suddenly couldn't find this product in any of the local stores. I started looking online, and was equally alarmed to discover what Amazon is charging for it. I'm not sure how they justify the $11.50 price tag (the current list price) when a jar costs less than half that in stores. Other merchants available through Amazon pretend to offer a lower price, but they make it up with ridiculous high shipping. Usually Amazon's prices are very good, so I don't know why this product is the exception. After ordering it here once or twice, I've finally managed to find another online merchant that charges only $4 each if you order six, and applies reasonable shipping to the lot, so I probably won't buy it here anymore.<br /><br />TLDR: This jerk spice rub is amazing and I wholeheartedly recommend it, but presently there are better places to order it online. (Note to Amazon: charge a competitive price and I will go back to buying it here!)

review/text: If you've ever had freshly caught tuna in a restaurant, it can be very disappointing to come home to a can of chicken of the sea. ;)<br /><br />Of course this American Tuna can't quite be as good as a nice seafood restaurant, but it's the best you're going to find in a can.<br /><br />It has more than twice as much Omega 3's as the nearest competition and less sodium too.<br />The great thing about this tuna is it doesn't have that metallic taste the Wild Planet Vietnamese Tuna. This tuna is pole caught in/near the USA, and packaged in the USA as well. But you can read that in the description.<br />Something else that is accurate in the description is the fact that you don't have to drain. You can eat it right out of the can, and there will only be a very small amount of fish oil in the bottom when you're done.<br /><br />If I were to say anything negative it would be that there is slightly too much salt for my taste, but they do have a non-salted version.<br />And of course the price is a bit hard to swallow, unlike the yummy tuna.<br /><br />I hope Amazon carries this soon as the seller (American Tuna) is a bit slow on shipping compared to Amazon. (Who isn't though?)

review/summary: Best Can Tuna I have ever tasted and healthy/sustainable
review/text: My fiance pointed out to me the many downsides to regular canned tuna, from high mercury to one lb of by-catch of other fish and sea turtles for every lb of tuna caught the typical, "sea chicken" commercial way (note, 1:1 !). Even though dolphins have been pretty much eliminated as by-catch in US sold tuna, much other sea life has not. The only alternative to get much lower mercury and very low by-catch is by troll or pole catching. American Tuna and Wild Planet apply these techniques (see American's www site for interesting videos of the work intensive catching process by pole). I tried both and even though I liked Wild Planet Tuna over "regular" canned tuna, American Tuna is even better and especially fresher tasting! Its so good it was hard to believe it came out of a can when we first tried. Other benefits of American over Wild Planet is the even lower, ~ 1/2 mercury level compared to Wild Planet, and that it is not just caught in the US but also canned here, whereas Wild Planet apparently ships their US caught tuna to Vietnam for canning and then ships it back!? There is a significant price difference but we have decided to eat a bit less tuna but when we do to get the best. BTW, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Sustainable Seafood Guide is an excellent resource if you are interested in the healthiest and most sustainable seafood. It also exists as smartphone app.

review/summary: best. tuna. EVER.
review/text: This brand will spoil you for all other tunas. Period.<br /><br />First of all, when you open a can of American Tuna, Dorothy, I can assure you, you are not in Kansas anymore. It's a sashimi grade tuna steak, not crumbles, pieces or flakes. It's from one piece of fish, not Charlie D'Tuna and 49 of his fishy friends. You CAN'T squish the can lid down to where there's about a quarter of the height left as with other tunas; in fact when you open the lid you'll probably do as I do and drink the broth. All Omega 3s baby!!!<br /><br />If you compare how little product you actually get out of a "regular" can of tuna and one of these, there is probably about 2.5 to 3 times as much tuna in a can of American Tuna. Relatively speaking then, it's not really any more expensive. What it *IS* is totally worth the extra cost, on EVERY level. 42 grams of protein in every can. Hand filleted, hand packed, caught and canned in USA.<br /><br />more things to love about American Tuna:<br /><br />Real fishermen, real families, sustainable fishing practices. Plus excellent customer service provided by the real families that catch the fish. I actually spoke with one of the fishermen's wives after calling for more information about the mercury testing. I could not have been more impressed.<br /><br />Pole caught fish means I don't worry about mercury levels; they do independent tests for that too just in case. You can ask for copies of the testing.<br /><br />Tastes better than any other brand of tuna I've ever had. Folks that say it's dry maybe have not read the part where it's not meant to be drained.<br /><br />There are also salt free, jalapeno and garlic versions too.<br /><br />Once you open a can though, there is no going back. You'll be spoiled rotten for anything else. You've been warned.

review/text: I can't believe I pay $5.50 per can for this tuna, but now that we've been eating it there's no going back to the regular tuna we used to pay $1 per can for. I can't even get this tuna at a store near me, since none of the stores near me sell it. I'm just thankful that Amazon sells it. That should tell you how good this tuna is. I also like the fact that it is caught and canned in the US. Hand filleted and hand packed. The best reason to buy it though is because it tastes great.

review/summary: My Welshie loves this stuff.
review/text: My Welsh Terrier, Nevsky (long story), is now well on his way to 15 years old.  He's slowing down a bit and he's a little creaky in the hips but he still has the energy to run around and play when the spirit hits him.  He has been eating Beneful for several years now but he would occasionally get into a temper mood and refuse to eat for a day or so.  I always mixed the dry Beneful with "wet" meat food from Iams or, more recently, also from Beneful.<br /><br />When I spotted Beneful's Incredibites (smaller food morsels) in the 14 pouch box, I gave it a try.  Half a pouch plus half of a plastic container of Beneful's meat food per day.  Nevsky is 22 pounds.  He loves this combination and he has never refused to eat since getting Incredibites.  In fact at 5:00 pm, he starts following me around the house flashing Incredibite eyes.<br /><br />My only complaint.  I found the pouches to be very handy but Beneful's Incredibites has dumped the box of pouches, replacing it with bagged food.  We'll continue to buy it, but it certainly is less convenient.

review/summary: Beneful is great!
review/text: I have a miniature dachshund that is addicted to table food. Normaly I leave dry food available at all times and 1 bowl of wet food a day. He has always been a picky eater, basically just wanted human food. Recently he would take a bite or 2 of his dry food and barely touch his wet. So we decided to switch dog food, and ended up choosing this. He LOVES this stuff, I can't leave dry down anymore because he gobbles it up before it hits bowl! Also we buy the containers on Beneful wet food, he loves that as well!<br />Another thing that I love about this food is it makes his coat shiny and soft. Not sure how but ever since he started eating this he has had softer and shinier coat.

I enjoyed buying them in individual packages but then the dog food started coming out in the big bags.  I have a problem, I cannot seem to find the bags when I need them.

review/summary: Good taste, low salt.
review/text: Research continues on the health benefits of chicken soup.  Dr. Stephen Rennard at the University of Nebraska Medical Center states that "chicken soup acts as an anti-inflammatory. The soup, he says, keeps a check on inflammatory white blood cells (neutrophils). Cold symptoms, such as coughs and congestion, are often caused by inflammation produced when neutrophils migrate to the bronchial tubes and accumulate there."  Many other studies promote chicken soup and broth for health and well being.  Progresso recently came out with a 100% natural unsalted chicken broth.  Heavy salt content is usually a good reason to steer clear of the various commercial soups at your supermarket.  When a soup says it is unsalted, that usually means it doesn't taste good.  No so with the new Progresso chicken broth. The broth has a golden color and full flavor.  It does not taste watered down.  In fact, it is delicious, at least in my opinion.  When used in cooking, with rice for example, it enhances the flavor of the rice.<br /><br />Some facts taken from the soup carton:<br />Calories per serving -- 25.  Total fat -- 0g.  Cholesterol -- 0%  Sodium -- 125mg, 5% of daily recommended amount (so the broth does have some salt).  Protein -- 4g. Potassium -- 240mg.<br />Total carbs -- 2g.<br /><br />This broth appears to be a tasty alternative to a cup of green tea for those health minded folks who want some variety in their choice of beverages.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Close but No Cigar
review/text: We all know that sardines are almost a perfect food, though they clearly are an acquired taste.  I happen to love brisling sardines and eat them regularly with European style whole grain bread for lunch with iced tea.  I'm 100% Norwegian, so perhaps I have fish oil in my blood.<br /><br />When I came upon this product I was very excited.  My local specialty grocer, Trader Joe's, recently discontinued offering King Oscar Cross Pack Extra Small Norwegian Brisling Sardines in olive oil and I was bereft, at least until I found these sardines from Crown Prince.  I immediately ordered two cases from Amazon.<br /><br />These are acceptable sardines but I have to say they are decidedly second class when compared with those offered by King Oscar.  Perhaps it is the fact Crown Prince sardines are "wood smoked" that dries them out, but that is my primary objection.  King Oscar sardines are bathed in olive oil, moist and succulent.  Yes, the Crown Prince product has olive oil in the bottom of the can but the sardines themselves remain dry.  I've even taken to storing the boxes upside down in the hope the olive oil will permeate the sardines.  Thus far, my efforts have failed.  Perhaps the problem is the sardines themselves are a bit bigger than those "extra small" sardines from King Oscar.<br /><br />Sadly, despite my communication with the producer and distributor, I've been unable to locate a vendor either locally or online who carry my preferred sardines in the distinctive black box.  I will eat the Crown Prince sardines, reminding myself of their excellent health benefits.  I may even buy more of them if I'm unable to discover someone selling King Oscar but I will sorely miss the joy of eating sardines!

With a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and a bit of fresh lemon juice, they're a gourment (and health) treat.

review/text: Cross packed means packed across the can, the short side, not the long side like most sardines.  These are the smallest fish you'll get in a sardine can, and they taste sort of nutty and a bit like oysters or clams when compared with larger sardines.  These are the little ones that fit right on a little cracker.  Yum!<br /><br />They're also not the easiest to find in stores, and since sardines tend to be seasonal, you can't get them any time you want during the year.<br /><br />I enjoyed these little cross packed sardines and will likely buy them again.  They just weren't up to the level of delicacy and taste of the Season cross packed sardines, but it's all really a matter of personal taste and these are pretty good.

review/text: The two Carl lemon seasonings ARE DIFFERENT.<br /><br />Lemon Seasoning and Meat Rub AND Lemon Garlic Seasoning and Meat Rub both have the exact same ingredients listed and in the same order, but THEY ARE DIFFERENT.<br /><br />The taste is different and the size and crunch of the spices are different.<br /><br />I can't say which is better.<br />It will take time.<br />Actually I just bought Pappy's Lemon Pepper which has four types of peppercorn and lemon zest.<br /><br />I will update later.

review/summary: BENNE WAFERS FROM BYRD COOKIE COMPANY
review/text: We were vacationing in SC and wanted to get something for our friends and family that represented the<br />South.  We did not see anything from SC as we travelled around the State.  My sister recommended the<br />Benne wafers.  We ordered nine boxes.  The wafers are wonderful.  They were enjoyed by everyone.

review/summary: NOT Benne wafers
review/text: They were good for what they were - sesame sugar cookies.  They, however, were NOT even close to being Benne Wafers.  They are made in Savannah and sold in a Charleston themed box.  They would do well to drive to Charleston and see a real Benne Wafer.  Again, they were good for what they were, but bad for what they were trying to be.

review/summary: Roulette's rock!
review/text: I picked up some of these candies at work and I have been hooked ever since. I am beyond addicted to gummi-candies. At first, I found the texture of these slightly odd, but by the second "coin" (?) I wondered how I ever ate chewy gummies before! I don't think I will ever be able to go back to plain old gummi candy again! Everyone has to try these!

review/summary: A must-have ingredient for vegetarian cooking!
review/text: I've been living in the US for the last nine years and every trip back to Australia has made me a courier of Massel "chicken" cubes for all my vegan and vegetarian friends. When anyone has come to visit, they have become couriers too. It almost made us sorry we told our friends about it. Recently finding them available on Amazon caused a great day of celebration as there is nothing else in the US like the Massel faux beef and chicken stock cubes. They're a vital ingredient when doing veggie versions of meat dishes. The vegetable flavour is excellent too and my mother swears by that one using it in her real meat dishes. Set aside that this is vegetarian, Massel is just excellent stock!

review/summary: Vegetarian/Vegan staple
review/text: I have been using these for years. They are the best bouillon I have tasted, even comparing to ones that do have MSG and other questionable ingredients. Most other Vegetable bouillons and broths are nasty. You will not be sorry for trying these. The thing I missed the most after going veg was chicken noodle soup, and this makes a fabulous one. I only use about half of what they say on the box, though, or 1/2 cube for 2 cups of water. I also use the Beef style for making stews and barley soups. Very yummy.
