review/summary: It does exactly what it says!!!
review/text: Wow, my husband and I have been praying for something like this...oil we can use guiltlessly and still lose weight!  Make no mistake, my husband and I workout and eat very healthy majority of the time.  However, we feel having this oil has made a difference in helping reduce fat in our bodies!  The oil is doesn't add any flavor to foods...but the food does taste great!  We've used it for deep frying...food are very crispy!  The oil lasts a much longer time in the deep fryer and the food REALLY doesn't absorb the oil and become greasy like other oils!  We've used it for making dressing...it works great and doesn't add any funny tastes, just enhances!  We've even used it to saute foods and had the same results...great tasting food!<br /><br />We're going to continue to make this the only oil we use!

review/summary: Great to cook with! *is high in calories
review/text: I'll admit, I ordered this product after it was recommended on the Dr. Oz show. I use it while cooking, instead of olive oil to saute and as a substitution for butter or vegetable oil in all recipes. I have been using it for 3 months and I have overall been very pleased with it. I don't notice any difference or change to texture or taste when using it as a substitution.<br /><br />Ideally, it would be lower in calories, but comparatively is similar to other oils and butters. It is more of the 'good' kind of fat, so I continue to use it.

review/summary: So Very Yummy
review/text: I first heard about this brand of mustard in a cookbook that I adore. The author wrote that it was good for a salad dressing she was writing about. So, I looked at my locals stores (none of which carred it) and then found my way to Amazon. I am not a connoisseur of mustards or any other condiment for that matter But i really like this mustard. It doesn't have the bitterness that Grey Poupon does. I will continue to buy this item over anything currently available at our current grocer. It is worth it.

review/text: First had this mustard at Kelley's Island Winery in Ohio. We bought the biggest jar we could find there, and have had a tough time finding in anywhere. It's wonderful on sandwiches, or the snack we had at the winery with sharp cheddar, apples and warm bread. If loving Rolands is wrong...I don't want to be right. Amazon is the only place I can find it.

review/summary: Unfortunately, this one didn't work for me...
review/text: I dislike writing bad reviews, I'm one of those people that believes that if you don't have something nice to say, you shouldn't say anything at all.  BUT, I am a tea reviewer and above all, it is important for me to tell it like it is, and sometimes that requires me to say something is bad when it is.<br /><br />And unfortunately, this Peach Matcha just doesn't hold up to the other Matcha teas that I've tried.  I've tried quite a few of Red Leaf Tea's Matcha (as you can tell by looking at the number of reviews that I've posted), and there have only been two that I've not enjoyed - this one and the apricot.<br /><br />Prepared traditionally using hot water and whisking, this is has a strong chemical taste that is really off-putting.  However ... and this Matcha's one redeeming quality which is why I gave it two stars instead of one ... if you make it as a latte, it ends up tasting much better.  The chemical taste is nearly gone (there are still traces of this taste, but it is very faint) and I can taste the peach and the matcha.  These flavors are also muted a bit because of the milk, but, it makes a nice, tasty matcha latte that tastes of matcha and peach.<br /><br />However, even though the latte was far better than the traditionally prepared Matcha ... I can't give it a higher rating because of that chemical taste.  I do hope that Red Leaf Tea considers finding a better flavoring for the peach and the apricot.  I had high hopes for them.

review/text: My first batch was a little too flavored, but Red Leaf was glad to replace it, which I am very thankful for. With the right flavoring, it's still not one of my favorites, but that could be previous memories of the taste. Peach blends well with the flavor of matcha, though, so it is a very enjoyable drink overall. Be careful with the temperature of water you use to avoid it becoming bitter, and definitely try it cold with just a touch of sweetener!

review/summary: Millions of peaches...
review/text: Millions of peaches...peaches for me! Millions of peaches....peaches for free! Yay! Flashback to the nineties, y'all. This time I've tried the Peach Matcha from Red Leaf Tea, and yum...it takes a bit of fiddling, but once you get it right, it is delicious. A welcome addition to any collection! And keep in mind that I'm still new to matcha and trying to figure it all out.<br /><br />As any good Southern girl would, I have a deep love in my heart for peaches. Deep, deep love. That fruity sweetness...is there anything better? There are few things in this life better than a fresh, juicy peach. A close second is ice cold peach tea. Peach cobbler, peach pie...summer is a good time to be in the South!<br /><br />I opened my package of this matcha and, my wife will back me up on this, my first words were "Whoa, momma!" It smells so good. Like juicy peach candy....nom. It smells painfully delicious.<br /><br />The taste certainly follows up on that scent! It tastes like a big, juicy peach lollipop. It's not a fresh peach, but it's a peach candy. It reminds me of the peach soda I used to get in high school at the local Food Lion to take to our weekly slumber party with my best friend. So I'm grateful for those memories. Makes me want to pop a big bag of popcorn and dip it in nacho cheese. Oh yes, we were super healthy.<br /><br />Anyway, this matcha has the same bitter kick as the lemon matcha, but a touch of sugar chased that away. I think that's just a matcha thing. It's definitely one I want to try again and see how it goes. Maybe cut it with a touch of the vanilla...peaches and cream! Yes please! This would be good in my smoothies this summer, maybe a peach raspberry smoothie dream...nom.<br /><br />I made a second cup with different parameters (12 ounces of water instead of 8 to one half teaspoon of matcha, as well as a bit more sugar) and it is heavenly. Juicy enough to satisfy this Southern gal! Finishing off my sample of this will be no great hardship, I assure you. It tastes like a fuzzy navel without the alcoholic bite! Or those peach gummy candies...yum!<br /><br />I let some of this chill and GAH. Cold, this is beyond amazing. This is what I needed, cold and fruity and peachy! It's not too sweet, it's not too bitter, it's just a beautifully refreshing cold drink for summer...I have a feeling this will be a staple in my cupboard this summer.

I thought it was in my head at first because nothing really gives me energy without making me jittery, but each time I used it, on an empty stomach, the result was the same, the energy to get what you need to get done. The bag says to use 1 tsp., but I need a lot of energy so I used a Tbsp. instead but I am ordering a few more bags as we don't have a Whole Foods or Central Market where I am at.

review/text: I love these nougats and I am sad that they're only available at holidays.  I've tried to buy them in bulk and stash them for the long period between valentines and halloween, but after a while they get stale and life is too short to eat stale candy. For sure, they're not chocolately like an Andes mint, but if you're not looking for a box of chocolates, and you like a pleasant, mild taste sort of like a minty tootsie roll, these chocolates are for you. The peppermints are just as good.<br /><br />Here's the biggest bonus: you know when you eat sticky candies and your teeth start to ache very unpleasantly? These candies will not do that- they are soft and easy to chew and you get a mouthful of flavor without having to see the dentist.<br /><br />Suggestion: Buy these for grandma cause the older one gets, the more one enjoys this treat!

review/summary: One of my favorite items to have on hand for sandwiches and more
review/text: Skillet is the name a popular Seattle area food truck owned and operated by Culinary Institute of America trained chef, Joshua Henderson. After working at a variety of top restaurants (including a stint as Head Chef at Beverly Hill's Avalon), Josh moved back to Seattle, bought a 1962 Airstream trailer and now serves gourmet food out of it to Seattle's night-time crowd.<br /><br />Skillet's signature item is simply called "The Burger" and what really sets it apart from other deluxe, $12 hamburgers is a generous slathering of Henderson's own creation, Bacon Jam. When I first encountered this product I was so blown away by it's heavenly, bacon-rich flavor that I rushed to my computer to find out how it is made. This is from Skillet's website: "... we take a big bunch of really, really good bacon, and render it down...add a bunch of spices..onions, etc. and let it simmer for about 6 hours...give it a quick puree, blast chill it...and you have bacon jam..."<br /><br />This stuff is great! It has a thick, spreadable consistency with hints of powdered chilies, brown sugar and vinegar. It gives a somewhat subtle but unmistakable bacon taste to whatever you spread it on. Hamburgers are a natural, but I have used it on paninis, grilled cheese sandwiches and a baked potato. This will be a regular item in my house. I should be able to use Bacon Jam for things other than sandwiches and I look forward to experimenting with this wonderful spread.

review/summary: nutrition info doesn't add up
review/text: I love this cocoa, but if you're counting calories be aware that the nutrition info on the label (which you can view near the top of the product page) is a fairy tale.<br /><br />A single serving (1 tablespoon, 5g) is listed as 10 calories yet contains 1g of fat, 2g of carbs, and 4g of protein (which comes to 7g and 33 calories, not 5g and 10 calories).  So something, somewhere has to give.<br /><br />I looked up this exact same product on the Saco site and they post different numbers (1g fat, 3g carb, 1g protein) which at least add up correctly on weight, but they don't include calorie information (which should be 25 calories if the nutrition information is accurate).<br /><br />As I consume vast quantities of this powder in a low-carb diet, understating the calories by a factor of three or more is not a minor issue.<br /><br />I'll keep using it, but with muted zeal.

review/summary: My favorite cocoa where I can use it!
review/text: This cocoa is a blend that balances the delicate flavor and low acidity of Dutched cocoa with the strong flavor of natural cocoa. Since both types of cocoa have strong advantages in recipes, for an all around cooking cocoa, this is my favorite.<br /><br />The flavor, just plain, unsweetened, is reminiscent of milk chocolate rather than bittersweet. The Dutch cocoa has a lot of the acid neutralized in it to make it milder, the natural cocoa is still very strongly chocolate. The aroma is just wonderful.<br /><br />Dutched cocoa also dissolves better in recipes for more incorporation. It's not as chocolate-y as natural cocoa though.<br /><br />This blend dissolves well and smoothly, and while it's not as strong as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OSPGJ8">Scharffen Berger (Scharffenberger) Natural Cocoa Powder</a>, the smoothness makes it perfect for puddings and hot chocolate. It's also good just as a cocoa garnish on things.<br /><br />Because of the lower acidity, for baking soda type baking, I recommend using natural cocoa instead or substituting buttermilk for any milk in the recipe because baking soda works by reacting with the acid in the cocoa in some recipes. I also recommend natural cocoa if you prefer a very strong chocolate flavor.<br /><br />My favorite hot chocolate is a tablespoon of this, a cup of almond milk, and a tablespoon of honey, heated up over a medium heat and whisked until everything is mixed. Wonderful on very cold days.

review/summary: SACO Cocoa Powder - Great Quality, Service, & Price
review/text: I used to buy this at Fred Meyer (Kroger) and like the taste as I use it to make hot cocoa in a huge insulated mug laced with two teaspoons of instant coffee to enhance the taste, but when the price shot up from $2.99 per 10oz. container to $4.45 within a few months I decided to try an alternative supplier. Amazon had it at $3.21 per container when bought by the case and with free shipping, so I ordered two cases on alternate days - July 4 & 5, 2011. They both were shipped on the day following the order and arrived in small town coastal Oregon on the same day, July 13. Interestingly, tracking showed that one case was shipped from Kentucky and the other from Arizona. The KY shipment was in its factory box, while the AZ shipment was double-boxed with the factory box padded on top inside an Amazon box. Both arrived with no noteworthy damage - only a couple of slightly dented containers, which are very susceptible to denting. Different packing standards in different warehouses?<br /><br />This is marketed as baking cocoa powder but it makes very good tasting hot cocoa - I prefer the taste over that of Hershey's, and I have used both Hershey's Regular and Dark varieties.<br /><br />As usual Amazon's service has been fast and efficient, and the price is a bargain.

review/text: I like the value of this item.  Although did have packaging issues...  The twelve canisters all came together in a box without packing peanuts/etc.  Several of the seals broke and lids popped off in shipment.  I let Amazon customer service know, and they sent me another box of 12 for free.  Very nice of them.  The new shipment also had the same issue of popped seals and lids of several of the cans of cocoa.  What I ended up doing was taking eight of the 24 cans that had opened and divided them between two resealable plastic containers.  Another I have in the pantry.  The rest of the other 15 containers that hadn't popped a seal (although half or so of those had dents in the cans but not opened) I have in storage, and I told my family they will probably getting some stocking stuffers in the form of cocoa canisters...  And lots of brownies and pudding at our house!<br />I do appreciate Amazon trying to help with sending a new shipment--and for FREE!  Perhaps they can find a better way to send out this particular order to others in the future.  :)

review/summary: Not Hershey's cocoa
review/text: If you are used to dutched cocoa (or you don't know the difference between cocoa processes) you may want to try a single container before ordering the 12 pack.  The taste of this blend is a little unusual compared to the Hershey's cocoa and other brands I have tried.

review/summary: Scrumptious!
review/text: When the winter comes with its dark days, this delightful hot beverage will ease you through those somber months. I am not a gourmand, but I know what I like. This is so much better than those dry powder instant mixes requiring only hot water. It is a blend of natural cocoa and Dutched cocoa that is great for recipes. The Dutched cocoa reduces acidity for a smoother, richer flavor. I was a kid raised on Hershey's cocoa, this is better. I love it! Satisfies that deep down choco craving!<br /><br />Just add a cup of fresh milk, 2 teaspoons of sugar and heat it in a microwave oven. Presto! Instant gratitude and cheerfulness!

review/text: I ordered this in 2011 for $34.58 - the current price of $50+ is just too much.  When it arrived, the box was damaged but no cocoa was burst or open.  The foil security liners were intact.  I've used it for cakes for years and it's great tasting cocoa!

review/summary: Love this cocoa, not the price
review/text: I only use Saco cocoa because it's amazing, but I don't know what going on with the price. It's almost doubled over the past 3 years or so on Amazon. Wish I still lived in New York where, as of now, I'm betting it's cheaper to buy in store (Yonkers Super Stop And Shop carried it). Unfortunately, my local stores here in northern California dont carry it.  Bummer.

review/text: I make some absolutely delicious chocolate oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. I am constantly being asked for the recipe and tell them the secret ingredient is Saco Premium Cocoa. My friends, colleagues, and others that I have given this recipe to have made the cookies with a different more expensive cocoa with a name that starts with an N and their cookies don't taste as good. The proof is in the pudding, this is truly premium cocoa.

review/summary: Best Cocoa
review/text: You really cannot beat this cocoa for the quality, quantity and price. I have been using this for years and panicked slightly when my local grocery store stopped carrying it. Luckily I found this on Amazon and had no hesitation about buying a case of twelve canisters. I love the brownie recipe on the back of the container but have also successfully made rich chocolate cakes and frostings with this cocoa. The Saco web site also has some good recipes that I'd recommend. I would not ever go back to Hershey's or Nestle's cocoa powder; even Ghirardelli (which I love for their delicious semi-sweet chocolate chips) does not compare to this. I don't see the need to spend a lot of money on the pricier brands for just regular home baking. This is definitely my go-to cocoa powder and I will have this in my pantry as long as this company continues making it.

review/summary: The Best Cocoa Powder on the Market!
review/text: I have tried all the popular brands of cocoa powder around, and this is by far the best. It is a blend of regular and dutched cocoa(dutching is a process that removes some of the acidity of cocoa, giving it a more mellow flavor). It has the most agreeable true cocoa flavor of all the brands. It also has a very fluffy texture. It is a pity that it is sometimes hard to find. Strangely, even though I buy it at popular chain stores, I find some particular stores in the chain will carry it while others in the same chain will not. If you are lucky enough to find this, buy it! Of course, you can also purchase it online...hopefully.<br />Keep in mind that this is a low fat, very low calorie(it is not sweetened), healthy food that can be used to make some very healthy and fun foods!

review/text: I use this cocoa for my daily hot cocoa, and so am sensitive to nuances in taste. The cocoa is quite good, although not as rich tasting as, say, Hershey's or some gourmet cocoa powders. It is milder, and considering the price, well worth it. Also, if it is being used for baking, the difference in flavor may not matter.

review/summary: Excellent cocoa at a great price.
review/text: This cocoa is far better than Hershey's, Nestle, or any other kind of tried.  It looks much richer and more chocolatey than most cocoa powders I've seen.  The taste is excellent and makes a great hot cocoa or brownies.  Purchase this item with something else like a book you already wanted to buy or something, so you qualify for the Free shipping.  At $2 a canister, you just can't beat the price and the quality is better than the more expensive stuff!<br /><br />I'm disappointed in the packaging though as several cans were packed on their sides instead of standing straight up (there was no need to do this as there was adequate space in the box) and were dented very badly.  This doesn't reflect on the product, just the person who was apparently very sloppy in their packaging.<br /><br />Update 5/12 - I can't believe this has gone up to $4 a container now.  I actually just saw it in a local store for under $4 so I may not be purchasing it on Amazon anymore unless the price goes down.  It's still the best cocoa I've ever used and I hope it stays reasonably priced because it's the only one I will use now.

The chocolate beverage syrup is far superior than any store bought version. The chocolate cakes, muffins and brownies had a well rounded smooth chocolate flavor. The chocolate fudge (using the Saco web site recipe) resulted in a deep, smooth chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/summary: good black beans, suitable for vegetarians
review/text: After visiting Guatemala several times, I developed a particular fondness for black refried beans.  I now prefer black refried beans over the typical pinto refried beans.  Unfortunately, finding black refried beans that taste good (i.e. no metallic aftertaste) and don't have lard can be difficult.<br /><br />These beans when cooked, are of a slightly more liquid consistency, which is great for dipping bread or chips.  The ingredients for these beans include: black beans, water, salt, onion powder and garlic powder.  A 1/2 cup of these beans has 120 calories and 1 gram of fat.  Per 1/2 cup serving, there is 440 mg of sodium (estimated at 18% of your daily value).  Please see the image gallery for this product to see a photo of the nutritional label.<br /><br />La Preferida refried black beans meet my dietary requirements, have a great consistency, and boast an excellent flavor. The only place I have been able to find this particular type of refried beans is Amazon.  Other brands of La Preferida are readily available in stores so stock up on these fat free beans on Amazon.<br /><br />These beans are a product of the United States.<br /><br />UPDATE January 2012:  I still utilize La Preferida black beans for cooking purposes.  They have a great consistency.  Since writing this review, I have found another manufacturer of good refried black beans. If you cannot find La Preferida, try San Miguel refried black beans.  San Miguel refried black beans are not presently sold on Amazon but can be found at some supermarkets (I buy mine at Meijer).  I actually prefer the San Miguel beans over La Preferida but La Preferida's beans are a bit more economical, especially when buying in bulk from Amazon.

There are actually pieces of beans that you can see, feel, and teast when you eat it.  It's so good you can eat it alone (I do) and it adds to any of your recipes requiring refried black beans.

review/summary: Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on
review/text: This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own "stand" in order to fill it properly.

review/summary: This filter works PERFECT!
review/text: Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the "old fashion way" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!

review/summary: Ekobrew Washer Hack
review/text: When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16" thick, 5/32" inside diameter, and 3/8" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.

review/summary: Good Product and Excellent Customer Service
review/text: At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.

First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.

review/text: This one is well thought out - perfect in every way!  I threw my old "My K-cup" out in the trash.  Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little?  Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly.  I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says "some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.  You have to move a small gasket down each time you switch between your K-Cups and your My K-Cup.  We don't have a new My K-Cup that works - so you need to just use this "work around" for the time being."  Now with my Eco-Brew - problems solved!  That's because it's the exact same size as the K-Cups!  No more changing the adapter in and out.  It works better too!  Coffee is stronger!  No more "hole down the middle" with weak coffee and wasted grounds that were never used.  Whoever designed this was a genius..... and too bad for Keurig they didn't think of it!

Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.

review/summary: Excellent brew, economical too!
review/text: With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!

review/text: I love peanut butter M&M's.  I love that they contain a ton of protein (relative to any other candy), the existential crunch of their thin candy shell, and their laxative effect when you eat enough of them.  With more substance and punch than the peanut M&Ms and lacking the acrid tang of the originals, they're the perfect food for road trips, the slopes of Kilimanjaro, or nervous trips to the doctor.  I always take some along on first dates, just in case.  They are an all-around classy candy, sometimes not safe for work, and that's the way I like it.

review/summary: 41/2 * You Gotta Like Tomato Sauce
review/text: Macaroni and Cheese Purists will NOT like this product.  Let's get this straight--this is macaroni (organic semolina, specifically), it is cheese (organic cheddar cheese made with organic cultured milk, enzymes, salt), but it is also TOMATO!(tomato puree made with organic tomato paste).<br /><br />I can only recommend the organicity and quality of this product; the flavor experience is an individual one. However, if you like tomato mixed with your macaroni and cheese, they've done a good job of blending the flavors into a natural and good tasting product.  Perhaps the addition of organic cornstarch, organic evaporated cane juice, sea salt, citric acid, organic onion powder, organic paprika, and organic garlic powder helped.<br /><br />Note:  This is an organic product.<br /><br />Nutritional Information:<br />In a one cup serving (two servings per can), you get:<br />150 calories (five from fat), 1 gram of fat (none of which are saturated!), NO cholesterol, a fairly big 680 mg, of sodium (28% of your daily requirements on a 2,000 calorie diet), 31 gr. total carbohydrate (a mimimal amount from fiber, &lt; 1 gram, and 11 grams of sugar), and 4 grams of protein.

review/summary: Not Bad...Not Great
review/text: OK, let's admit it.  Baked tortilla chips as a rule aren't that great, so this review reflects both my feelings about the basic concept of this snack as well as the specifics for this particular one.<br /><br />Like most baked tortilla chips, these are kind of large, hard, and thick.  The seasoning is very subtle, so if you like baked tortilla chips in general, don't shy away from these because you're concerned they'll be too spinach-y, too salty or too artichoke-y because they're not.  But also don't expect them to taste like that yummy appetizer dip you can order in most restaurants.  They don't....this is very subtle seasoning.<br /><br />This brand of baked tortilla chips is a bit different from some others I've tasted because they are harder and thicker than some others.  However, in terms of nutrition alone, they are probably better for us than most of the other options. In fact, I gave this product an extra star because I feel that this company does have a genuine commitment to making snacks as healthy as possible, so I trust that these are as good for you as tortilla chips can be.<br /><br />Personally I'd rather save my  tortilla chip experience for those rare occasions when I go out to a Mexican restaurant and enjoy those thin, home-made, yummy tortilla chips.  But that's just me.  If your family loves tortilla chips and wants to eat them weekly at home while watching TV, these aren't a bad choice at all.

review/summary: Not the same Vernors from my childhood in the late 1950's. Not even close!!
review/text: This is still better than Canada Dry.  When I lived as a child in the Detroit area (mid 1950's through about 1963 Vernors was available only in the greater Detroit area and southeastern Michigan.  You never forget the taste of your favorite soda as a kid, and I hahven't forgotten what Vernors USED to taste like.  About 12 years ago I found it here in California.  But it is next to impossible to find, and with most stores it's an on and off again availability situation!  However I just opened a can of regular Vernors a few minutes ago and am reminded that the formula has changed DRASTICALLY.  Mostly it's MUCH MUCH weaker tasting than when I was a kid.  It's mostly plain soda water... with only a HINT of the original Vernors than it was 50 years ago.  I still like it, but am VERY disappointed that since vernors was taken over at least twice over the years, that the owner has chosen to weaken the flavoring CONSIDERABLY.  Maybe they will see the light.,, but that is extremely unlikely considering who owns it now.  Vernors was I believe only second in sales around Metro Detroit (Coca Cola was first) 50 years ago. The reason I rated it at 1 star is because it's so MUCH weaker now. It originally used an extremely secret recipie that was truly in a high security vault.  Also it is NOW artificially flavored which means the entire formula has changed except for the fact they still use water! That is the only similarity vernors still has with the original formula. Perhaps the new owners have thrown away the old recipie.  It (was) the oldest soda made in America.  I say "was" because the REAL Vernors no longer exists.

review/summary: The Emasculation of a Detroit Icon
review/text: My considerate dad always makes sure to put in a supply of Vernors for me when I go home to Detroit. I don't know...when I was a kid, Vernors used to be STRONG (it was a popular quasi-medicine among Motown moms), and when you opened the (glass) bottle, you'd see "smoke" (yeah, I know it's gas--permit me my fancies), the tingling hitting one's nose with a blast that often resulted in sneezing. And finally, I'm dead-sure it was a crisper mouthfeel, with more "bite." Alas...<br /><br />Vernors, now a pleasant enough (hence two stars rather than one) soft drink for woosies, no longer advertises that it's "aged 4 years in wood." In fact, I don't believe it's aged in ANYTHING anymore. HFCS has replaced sugar (there's that new mouthfeel) and to make matters worse, Vernors is now owned by the heinous Dr Pepper Snapple Group--the bloodsucking corporate monster that permanently crippled the oldest Dr Pepper bottling plant in the nation in Dublin, Texas, resulting in a direct loss of 14 jobs (in this economy, mind you) and many more by domino effect (the town's economy turned on its Dr Pepper connection, including a museum), all because DPSG couldn't live with the fact that Dublin Dr Pepper was selling their soda over the Internet in supposed violation of their franchise agreement. Vernors is now a sweet, syrupy shadow of its former self, pleasant enough to those who don't know better, unable to stand up to the demands of a Boston Cooler, and every sip of which results in frustration that those truly marvelous things in life that could so easily have remained the same, don't. Given that Vernors is no longer the product with which I grew up and that they're owned by the soda-producing equivalent of Satan, I plan to inform my dad NOT to continue buying Vernors on my behalf. Not-what-it-used-to-be Vernors has just joined its buddies Dr Pepper, A&W root beer, and my even-more-beloved-than-Vernors Squirt (thank goodness for Ting) in my personal "soda limbo," along with anything else I happen upon that's owned by DPSG. "Woody," the Vernors gnome, is undoubtedly weeping ginger-infused tears.

review/text: This item seems to have disappeared from stores in my area, but happily Amazon has it.  I use this as an addition to homemade tomato sauces of different types and find it adds just the right depth of flavor and texture.  I generally use tomatoes from my garden, fresh or frozen, as a base and paste from a tube to help thicken it.  The herbs and spices are up to me and while I enjoy adding various things depending on the purpose for the sauce, using a bit of this product in addition seems to ensure consistently good results.  I'd like it even better without the MSG, but since the portion size isn't huge, I can live with it.  I end up with sauces that guests and family rave about and can definitely tell the difference when I don't have any.  Maybe someday I'll figure out how to duplicate the flavor, but until then I'm keeping this product in my pantry.

review/summary: Good Dog Food - Amazon Subscribe/Save Ripoff
review/text: Well - I'm not changing my review of the dog food. I stand by Pedigree and my dogs thrive on it. HOWEVER, I bought my first 24-pack for $12.66 and did Subscribe and Save. Thank goodness I looked, because the price when my next shipment was due had gone up to $24. Then it was $17, now I think it's $16 something.  You simply cannot tell me the price of this dog food DOUBLED in less than a month. There is something very wrong here, so I'm not downgrading the dog food, I'm downgrading what Amazon is doing with pricing. Very, very wrong. Beware of Subscribe and Save. Like another reviewer, I'll be going back to lugging cans of dog food rather than pay double.<br /><br />Initial review, prior to price increase: *I have to have wet food around for my older rescue dogs - and my own two love this as well. Was surprised to find it on Amazon, available at a better price than the store and with subscription I will NEVER run out again. I know some people don't like Pedigree due to high filler content, and if I had my druthers, I'd be feeding my crew a raw, organic diet.  But I don't. With the rate people are dumping dogs, we feed them as best we can and there is NOTHING wrong with Pedigree Dog Food, canned OR dry.  I have two 8 year old dogs who have been raised on it and they are the picture of health. So with that in mind, give em all the love you can and don't feel like you're doing something wrong by feeding them Pedigree. This is much cheaper than I can get at the store and now I don't have to haul crates of food into the house. *

review/summary: My beagle wolfs this stuff down
review/text: so I think that he likes it.  He always looks around for more under his dish.  As I combine the food with a weight control dry dog food, it does not bother me that much of the can content is gravy compared to the higher calorie traditional ground dinner varieties but pet parents serving it alone may feel that it is not enough due to the higher water content.  Price with subscribe and save is very good.

review/text: I run an animal hospital and the dogs loves this dog food. My dog loves it too. I give a little canned on top of the dry food and the dogs love it. The chunks are a good size and it keeps the dogs stool regular.

review/summary: Fido loves it...but 3 cans smashed open defeited the JUST "decent" subscript. price
review/text: This is my dogs favorite dinner.  At subscription price it came to $.70 per can which is competitive with a walmart or foodlion sale.  HOWEVER, 3 cans arrived smashed open which put me back to paying regular price PLUS having to clean off all the gew that spilled over the unsmashed cans.  (Thats for a packaging review).  Had they all come in tacked, and I didn't have a mess and a $$ loss, I'd of given it 5 stars for the convenience and price.

review/summary: Horrible product - caused problems for my dog
review/text: I bought this particular canned Pedigree dog food from Petco for my dog, a spayed female corgi. Before trying Pedigree, we were feeding her Science Diet dry food. I bought a 12 pack of the ones with beef and ones with country stew. It was cheap (&lt;$1/can).<br /><br />Within a few days of feeding her the wet food mixed with some Science Diet dry food, her vagina started smelling strongly like fish. A few more days went by and thick bits of mucous were appearing on the fur around her vagina. One time I saw her pooping and at the same time saw a thick rope of mucous drop from her vagina. A few more days later, her fur around the vagina was tinged pink and later became red. It was evident to us there was mucous and some blood coming out of her vagina. So we stopped feeding Pedigree and went back to just the dry Science diet food. In a few days her excessive vaginal mucous and blood stopped. She is back to normal now.<br /><br />All in all we only fed her 5 cans of Pedigree dog food. For those 5 cans to cause this much problems is astounding. I would not recommend Pedigree to anyone after what happened to my dog.

review/summary: Beautiful box, delicious Tazo tea.
review/text: This Celtic inspired tea chest is simple but elegant. As soon as I saw it, I placed it on my wish list and was so happy when good friends bought it for me. The box is sturdy, and divided into quarters. Instead of the traditional paper packets, the tea bags are sealed in what feels like a paper/plastic blend but it also may just be a shiny effect that was added to the packets.<br />There are many Tazo flavors I haven't had the opportunity to try before, and they're so good! So many samplers have a number of "throwaways" in terms of enjoyment, but so far every flavor is bright, strong (but not too strong) and comforting. I've been a fan of Awake black tea for some time, as well as Passion, which is a fruity hibiscus blend great for iced tea. New to me is the Wild Sweet Orange, which is as sweet and juicy flavored as it sounds. I'm currently enjoying a cup of the Green Ginger, which has a spicy-sweet aroma and a fruity, gingery flavor that is not too sweet.<br />The only caveats so far are that The Celtic knot appears to be a raised, gold-covered applique as opposed to being embossed, but as long as it isn't actively peeled off it doesn't look like it's going anywhere. Also, there is a chemical/lacquer smell that is evident in the box, but I don't find it has affected the tea at all. The dividers in the box would allow for it to be used to store more tea, or small items like jewelry. It's a great gift for a tea novice to a tea lover.

review/text: I have been getting a lot of teas lately, and Tazo is always great. So when i found this, not only did i get a great tea organizer but i also was able to get a ton of tea to get me going. the shipping material was a little hard to open with my scissors but once done with opening it, you could see the person took great care to make sure you got your item in one piece. Overall, i would recommend this again.

review/text: The picture looks like the Kit Kat bar I typically buy at the store, but the product is actually extra crispy KitKat and is shapped more like a thick granola bar than the 4-piece-square I am used to.  Price was right to try it anyway - I am sure my kids will still eat them!  Expiration on the product is about 1 1/2 years from when I am ordering.  Not outdated.  Nice.

The milk chocolate has a nice smooth taste, and the wafer has just the right texture--not too hard or soft or crumbly. The combination is delicious.<br /><br />Shop for price.

review/summary: 3.5 stars would be more accurate
review/text: This package of noodles is a nice size for one.  You get a plastic tray with uncooked rice noodles, a fork, a packet of chili oil, and a seasonings packet.  You put the rice noodles in the tray, fill with water and microwave for 3-4 minutes.  then put the top on to drain the noodles.  Then add the seasoning packet and chili oil.  The finished product doesnt look like much, but it is delightfully spicy and somewhat filling although completely lacking nutrition.  I scored them for a dollar a box, but would be hesitant to pay much more than that.  For what I paid, I am satisfied, but probably would have been disappointed if I paid the regular price of $2.50/box.

review/text: I got this for my father for his birthday, he and I used to go deep sea fishing before I moved across the country. He loved it, and the salmon was the first to go(as to be expected). He also told me that he loved the spreading knife with a fish for a handle, which I didn't even know the bag came with. There was much more than expected, so I'm very glad I got it for him.

My usual is the Tazo Camomile with a few drops of rose water.  When I saw this product on Amazon in my search, I immediately signed up to try it and just got it.  I LOOOOVE it.
