NOT ONLY AM I NEVER HUNGRY ANYMORE, BUT I ALSO HAVE STARTED PLANTING APPLE TREES EVERY WHERE AND HAVE CHANGED MY NAME TO JOHNNY APPLESEED.

review/text: This has a interesting and fun flavor. If you don't like sugar-blasted cereal, avoid. Admittedly, it's been a while since I had this, but I think I'll buy some soon. It's hard to describe this flavor as apple-y when you compare it to other stuff like apple juice or apple pie, but I like it nonetheless, and it's a great-tasting cereal.

review/text: Incredible price. The freshness date into 2012. Good quality packaging to keep them fresh. I've been snacking on these and they are not too sweet and they have just a light taste of apple in them. The cereal is light and crispy and easy to chew on. Not too bad!!! They are actually fun to eat.

review/text: When I first subscribed, I got 4 boxes for $6.66. Great price, right?! But after eating 2 boxes, we were tired of all the sugar, so I canceled the next order when it automatically appeared in my cart. But I must have not canceled correctly because the order after that appeared in my cart months later (when I've totally forgotten about it and haven't used Amazon in a while) at $14.78! What the heck?! Isn't that higher than the price at the store? And I can't return them because my dad already opened one of the boxes before I found out. Grr!

review/text: I tried out this cereal for the first time in many many years, having eaten it growing up.  I was surprised to find out that there is no apple flavor what so ever.  It tastes just like a sweetened cereal, maybe a little bit of cinnamon but nothing more. While it was ok, it just didnt hit the spot.  I would not purchase this cereal again, just doesn't have the apple flavor I was hoping for.

review/summary: 5 stars for flavor; condition upon delivery - mess
review/text: These add a creamy, thick flavor to almost anything but once in a while I experience a very strange aftertaste with the chocolate flavor, usually when I use 2 vs just one in my beverage.<br /><br />The packaging, however, leaves a lot to be desired and unless you want a lot of work when this arrives, you might want to rethink this purchase. In recent weeks, I've purchased 3 cases of this product (that is 12 boxes of 50 single serve cups) in 3 flavors for the local emergency shelter here in Western, MA due to the tornadoes that ripped through my community and those of my family and friends. I am so thankful I looked at this product before just bringing it to the make-shift kitchens and coffee setups on the back of pickup trucks. This is what I experienced. What follows is actually my 'cut and paste' comments from one of my 'leave packaging comments' for Amazon, so it lists 2 cases vs 3. I purchased 1 first, then had second thoughts and went back and bought the additional 2 flavors (creamy chocolate, cinnamon vanilla (excellent flavor, by the way) and Irish Cream (a bit too subtle in flavor for me-could have a bit more oomph). As such, you'll see me refer to just 2 below.<br /><br />Exterior shipping box was fine and interior 'case' holding product perfectly intact. However, contents (50 in each)are a sticky, gooey, unusable mess. I purchased 2 flavors/2 cases = 8 cartons = 400 of this product and all 8 cartons are a disgusting disappointment. While the majority of the single serve cups are fine, a large handful in every one of the 50-pack boxes are squished, cracked or just ripped open. Contents spilled over the rest of the single serve cups throughout the boxes that are now slimy, sticky and tacky, with what looks like dried and/or tacky curdled milk all over them. I had to throw away 46 cups total and wash every other single serve cup by hand and then find another container to hold them all. I sure won't be buying these again.

review/summary: Great for Senior Dogs/priced too high
review/text: My dog has always consumed and loved pedigree, but with age she had needed some additonal help. The Healthy Maturity formula has all the nutrition needed for healthy joints which has slowed her down lately. I think this dog food has helped her to get along better than before we started it. Since it is loaded with salmon/fish oil, it has a rather potent smell and has made the dog very 'gassy' if you know what I mean. Of course my kids think it is funnier than anything on TV.<br />As for the price $18.99, that is outrageous. You can get this for under $11 at Walmart and Kmart.

review/summary: My dog loves it, so do the cats
review/text: I bought this dog food after my twelve year old pit/hound mix stopped eating another major brand. He scarfs this up like it was a bowl of beef liver. The food is processed into small pellets about the size of a slightly flattened green pea which mixes thoroughly and easily with canned dog food, a bit of scrambled egg or a splash of chicken broth. However, our pooch seems to like it dry almost as much as mixed with other protein. Even the cats will nibble on any leftover bits during the day. Amazon offers a reasonable price and combined with Prime free shipping this provides a convenient alternative to hauling heavy bags of dog food home from the grocery store.

review/summary: My senior dog looks forward to her meals again.
review/text: One of the problems senior dogs often face is a decreasing appetite. This may be caused by the pain of gum disease or broken teeth, decreased senses of smell or taste, and kibble too hard or too big for older mouths to chew. Pedigree does a great service to our aging canine population by formulating foods that appeal to the older dog; the kibble is easier to chew and appears to have a yummy smell to the dog. My 12 year old chow girl was just not eating and seemed sad. Cham seemed to be on a physical decline. I have used other Pedigree foods for decades and decided to try this senior dog food. She began eating a little more at each meal. Her coat shine has returned and her eyes twinkle once more. She has resumed barking at passing strangers-a sound that I was actually happy to hear again. She is definitely showing the benefits of good nutrition and I hope she will remain in good happy health for several more years.

review/summary: Doggie's Change of Pace
review/text: I've been using Harmony Dry Dog Food for the past 2 years with great success. However, the last bag had a rancid oil smell upon opening. Not sure if the Texas heatwave OR a recipe change was the cause. BUT my pooch ate it, just not with his usual gusto. Making gravies to enhance it pushed me to find some healthy "mix-ins". Searching the internet for reviews and pricing of various brands, led me back to Amazon and Pedigree on sale. I've been mixing this with his Harmony. He eats the combination heartily without digestive issues. Based on his favorable response I've purchased other Pedigree brand items (dry and wet) on sale through Amazon's Warehouse Deals with equally favorable response.  I won't give up on Harmony Dog Foods BUT I'll have other options as well so my fur-baby doesn't burnout on it.

review/summary: "The crazy kid eats the stuff..." and Mom is happy.
review/text: My older kids won't eat it if we paid them and it tastes kinda borderline to me.  But my 15 month old (who is picky) loves it.  I try to feed my kids food I prepare from my own kitchen, but this little guy wasn't getting enough iron.  The doc has put him on a high iron diet.  He always analyzes his food visually and won't let us pry open his mouth if it doesn't pass inspection.  But he willingly tasted this before he saw the green puree and was instantly sold!  I suspect he likes the cool delivery system. I'm checking with the manufacturer to see if it really is 120% DV for iron, or if it's a misprint.<br /><br />*** Update!  Yes, Ella's reports that it was a misprint and the company is working hard to fix the problem.  4% is the actual number.  That fits more with spinach's DV's.  Only way to get that high is to add iron supplements!  Glad I checked.  Got a quick and honest answer from them.  Hope they are able to fix labeling issues soon. It's still on our list of foods to boost iron levels.***<br /><br />I found some on sale in a local grocery store.  Amazon's price came pretty close, and is still cheaper than other online places I've found.  Including the manufacturer's website.<br /><br />Each kid has their own tastes, so don't write it off because it looks or tastes nasty to others.  Worth a try at least once (it might help to not look disgusted when you give it to your kids).  Seems to be a good product.  Now the frugal mom in me is trying to figure out if I can trick him by making my own puree and using a syringe to re-fill the bag so he'll eat!

Ella's Organics is a great go to. Paying this much for one pouch is a huge huge rip off.  Usually Babies R Us has them for $1 - $1.40 most likely on sale for a dollar though.  I am really happy with the Happy Baby brand too ... also almost $2 a pouch but usually on sale. Just last night my local grocery store had a 10/$10 sale on this brand.<br /><br />Seek out this product just never for this price!! Yikes.

When she turned a year old, she got really fussy and turned her little nose up at every single veggie we tried to give her. She would only eat fruit and yogurt with her cereal in the morning and for the rest of the day she would only accept meat. This has been going on for so long now that I began to get really really worried that she wasn't getting enough good nutrition. I had seen Ella's pouches, but hadn't tried them. A friend highly recommended them to us this weekend so I figured we should try it. I decided to go full on veggie and try this flavor (spinach, apple, rutabaga), and just give them away if she really hated it.<br /><br />Ok, so I'm only giving it 4 stars just in case things change, BUT i tasted one just now and thought, yuck, ok, this is REALLY strongly spinach flavored, she is NOT going to eat this, but I gave her the pouch and she gobbled it DOWN! She was still trying to get some out of the empty pouch! I can't believe it. I'm a very pleased mama. My fussy baby ate spinach, woohoo! :)<br /><br />I'll see how things go over the next few pouches, but so far I recommend them for fussy eaters. If she continues to like this one, I will try a few more. Thanks Ella's kitchen!

review/text: The product is great.  I have purchased it in retail specialty stores for $1+ per pouch, and my daughter LOVES them!<br /><br />However, when I purchased it here I assumed it would be less expensive and maybe I was getting 4 or 6 pouches for $4.  Not so much.  $4 per pouch is RIDICULOUS!

review/text: I too, thought I was getting 4 pouches, and because they are so easy and nutritious I ordered 5 different pouch recipes. Boy was that a rough day. I usually so look forward to getting my amazon packages. This was a let down, a major let down. Way overpriced, and confusing to order. DO NOT order these, unless you are prepared to pay that for 1 pouch.

There are SEVERAL other brands which offer the same thing--pureed fruits and vegetables in soft squeezy packages that can be sucked out by toddlers in carseats--and they are selling for around $35 for ***24***packages of squeezies. See that difference? The stuff tastes just as good, I've tried them. In fact, the broccoli one of Ella's is disgusting, in my opinion. I like the brand that starts with a "P", second word Organics. Not the bunny. These get one star for pricing. The star is given because the product is nice, but 4 stars are taken away because of the complete highway robbery of offering these in a pack of only 7 for $39.95. Don't encourage them.

review/summary: I am so disappointed with this company - buyer BEWARE indeed
review/text: After reading the reviews here stating that the Iron content of Ella's Kitchen Spinach packs was incorrect, I checked out their website to see for myself. Hmm.. no announcement there stating that an error had been made. So, I contacted the company wondering if it was a misunderstanding. No, it's true. The Spinach flavor only has 4-6% DV of Iron... NOT 120% as has been clearly indicated on the pouches I have been buying for my son for OVER A YEAR! I have been purchasing these packs by the case thinking that if my son did not eat enough other Fe-rich foods on a particular day, at least he would eat this. I mean you know how difficult it can be to get little ones to take in enough iron, so I thought this was a great option. IF I HAD KNOWN that it only contained 4 or 6%, then I would have given my son other additional Fe-rich foods or continued making my own purees. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true when I noticed that the first ingredient is in fact APPLES not Spinach as the front of the pouches would have you believe.<br /><br />What upsets me the most is that there is not even a warning or announcement on Amazon or at Target stores stating that there has been a mistake?!! If the company knows, why isn't this info passed on to the consumer?!!? Here I thought I was purchasing (a more expensive) but also more nutritionally complete product for my baby and to find out it's just as void of nutrients as all of the other brands on the shelves. I really thought this company was exciting and different and focused on kids' nutrition and health. I guess not. I am asking for a refund at the very least. Honestly, the company is lucky if parents don't decide to take up a lawsuit for their negligence in getting the word out. The incorrectly labeled packs should be recalled like anything else- not left on the shelves to trick parents! Normally, I am not one to overact and am certainly not litigious in the least. Humans (and companies run by humans) make mistakes. It's natural. But as a physcian and a mother, I am really annoyed by the lack of respect shown to consumers in failing to notify the community of this error.

review/text: This flavor does not actually contain 120% of daily iron for babies, as still listed on most packaging.  This was a grievous error (a "printing error" according to the company).  This flavor only contains 6% iron, in the realm of most other baby food pouch products.  Unfortunately, this company has failed to pull mislabeled products or notify distributors of the long running error.

review/summary: Tasty, a little bit runny
review/text: Great product.  For my older daughter, I made all organic baby food homemade.  Since we moved after the birth of my second child, we aren't able to get a nice fresh variety of organic fruits and veggies like we used to, so I decided to try buying organic baby food instead. My kids love these pouches (give or take a few of the flavors). I love the pouch packaging for easy clean-up, compact travel and not having to worry about carrying glass jars around.<br /><br />Both my infant (9 months old) and toddler (2.5 years old) love this flavor of Ella's the best, much to our surprise.  I think it's probably b/c it one of the few foods without bananas added.  It is a bit runny, so keep that in mind when using a spoon to feed.  But since it's so runny, it's good for younger ones that aren't used to thicker solids.<br /><br />The Spinach, Peas and Pears from Plum Organics is similar in taste, but is a little thicker, if the consistency of this one isn't right for you.  Also, we often mix this with some rice cereal to thicken it up if needed.<br /><br />I would recommend buying the variety pack to see which ones your kids might like.  Also, if they don't like it at first, don't give up, give them some time and try it again later.  They might change their minds.

The only ingredient not in the title is lemon juice.  No crazy preservatives or other ingredients.  The problem is the company that is selling them on Amazon.  Don't take it out on Ella's.  You can find it MUCH more reasonably priced on diapers.com, or at Target.  I agree w/ another reviewer that the Plum organics baby food is also good, and a little cheaper, but this is still a staple in our son's diet.

review/text: This is a great product, my daughter will not eat her vegetables, but she will fly through this pouch in just a few seconds.<br />However, it does not make sense that the seller is selling these at $30 for just seven pouches.  We buy these at target for about $1.20 per pouch. Sure with sales tax here in Chicago that turns out to be about $1.30 per pouch, but still quite a bit less than the $4+ that this merchant is charging.<br /><br />In short, if you are thinking about getting this product, do so!  However, do not pay this price for it.

Plus you can't beat the antioxidant goodness found in these baby food pouches. My cat eats her food with more gusto if I mix it into her food, and tends to not eat as much as before. She misses her teaspoon of Ella's if I don't mix it into every meal.<br /><br />By the way, it is the best baby food I've ever eaten. I always sneak a teaspoon or three when I'm fixing up my cats food.

I'm always tasting his foods before I give it to him and this is something I would eat! My son was EBF until 6 months, and I started out making his own organic baby food, but working full time and being a single mom it was taking up too much time that I could be spending with my son. I researched the Ella's kitchen organic baby food and decided to try it out, and we haven't found a kind he dislikes! This has made feeding time a joy for both of us.

But after trying Happy Baby and Plum pouches I realized that this product stands alone.  The other organic baby food pouch manufacturers really thin it out with water. This is much more concentrated.  My daughter loves it and we're getting more nutrition in every pouch.  It's also a lot easier to control and prevent spills because a gentle squeeze doesn't send the food oozing out everywhere.  I love it and highly recommend it.

review/text: I found these wondering the isle of Target one day.  I'd decided to try baby food again because all of a sudden she stopped eating fruits and veggies.  Won't touch them if she recognizes them.  I don't know if a carrot or a pea chased her in one of her dreams, but it's been a nightmare trying to force her to eat them.  So for a time I just gave up and then she gained weight...oh no.  So went to find some baby apple sauce and stumbled upon these.  Best. Discovery. Ever.<br /><br />I take 2 with me when we're out, and give them to her when we're in the car or in between plays on the playground.  The best part of these is that I can 'inject' these into her when we're rushed. She's loved all of the flavors except for the Sweet Potatoes, and gets a kick out of eating them herself.<br /><br />After calculating what it would cost for me to make such concoctions (cheap but time consuming) and taking into consideration the method of delivery (the spouted pouch, which is about 50% of this product's wow factor) that I can not imitate, Amazon is the very best place to buy these yummy pouches.  Amazon's price makes my daughter consuming 2-3 of these a day affordable.

But within that brand, it's the sweet potatoes, pumpkin, apples, and blueberries that both kids will gobble up. I think it's the combination of the purple packaging and the blueberry flavor.

review/text: I give these to my toddler, call them Applesauce, and he loves them still.  They are the perfect on-the-go snack, they take no prep, don't need to be refrigerated, and even have vegetables.  I'll use this over a bag of chips any day of the week.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: I purchased these for my sons, 19 mos and 4 years to eat as snack before dinner so that I knew they were getting a fruit serving.  I tried some before I gave any to them and they are pretty good.  There is definitely a distinct banana taste which is fine for us.  I like the containers.  I do think that Plum Organics or Happy Baby have comparable products and are less expensive than the Ella's Kitchen products.  I would definitely buy these again, though.

review/summary: little bit watery and sour in taste.
review/text: I purchased this item at local target store before I buy from amazon.<br />The Ella's Strawberries and apples taste bit sour and watery compare to Ella's Sweet Potatoes, Pumpkin, Apples + Blueberries(The purple pouch).<br />I tried to feed my twins and they both did not like it.<br />They really liked Ella's Sweet Potatoes, Pumpkin, Apples + Blueberries. They constantly ate the purple pouches but not this red one.<br />However, my twins ate it right after they finished purple pouch which was sweet, thicker and tasty.<br />I end up ate them all my self.

review/text: I've compared this product to the competition (Plum, Earth's Finest, Happy Baby) and none came close to the exceptional nutritional value.  120% iron - that's amazing.  I pack one of these in my toddler's lunch boxes every day, and she views eating her spinach as a treat - even more amazing.  So although this product is far more expensive than alternatives, given the taste and nutrition, this has become the one 'vegetable' I am guaranteed my daughter will consume every day.

review/summary: BUYER BEWARE! Read the nutrition label on Ella's website
review/text: This stuff is garbage and Ella's Kitchen should be ashamed for false advertising. I was really surprised to see a fruit product like this one had so much calcium (10%) on the package compared to most of the other baby fruits out there (usually 0-2% unless veggies or yogurt's added in) and chose this over other products, thinking the extra calcium would be worth the extra $ for my baby in the long run. When you check it against Ella's website, it HAS NO CALCIUM%! Same goes for all the other stage 1 Ella's fruits (butternut squash, carrots, apples, prunes: 30% calcium on package but 2% on the website, carrots, apples, parsnips 30% calcium on package vs. 0% on website all the same serving size) -- there were other differences too in protein, iron, etc. It does cost a lot more than some of the other organic baby fruits out there and tastes awful. If your baby is just as content with the other less expensive organic baby fruits out there, go with the cheaper alternative because nutrition wise, Ella's no better!<br /><br />What a disgusting marketing ploy by Ella's Kitchen to get parents to choose their products because it is falsely more nutritious when it's the same as other organic baby fruits in terms of nutritional value.

I had an assortment of Plum Organics, Earth's Best and a few Ella's Organics.  The Plum are a much more normal consistency AND taste better all around.  I mixed this with Brown Cow cream top plain yogurt (as I have done with all the other fruit pouches I brought for the weekend). This particular packet was so runny it was like spoon feeding them a bottle! Can you say disaster?! Won't buy again.

review/summary: Perfect for Picky Toddlers!
review/text: When my son was an infant he willingly ate a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Now that he's a toddler he refuses almost all fresh fruits and vegetables, even the ones that he used to love.  I use these to sneak healthy food into him!  I keep some organic baby food pouches in the car, so that I always have a healthy snack on hand for him.  He loves them!<br /><br />Note that these aren't as sweet as some of the other organic baby food pouches (such as Happy Tot's Spinach, Mango, and Pear).  If I give my son a sweeter pouch first, and then this pouch, he refuses this one.  If you think your child will eat more than one pouch, offer this sweet potato/pumpkin pouch first!  I am so grateful for these!

review/text: My son is now one, and looooves these little pouches. I can't even go through the baby food aisle at the grocery store without him seeing these and crying for one. I love the packaging because it is so easy for him to hold and eat off the spout. Plus, these are great to put in his diaper bag for snacks when we're out running errands or to feed him at a restaurant. He loves all the flavors of these, there are other brands out there that he didn't like and when I tried them they were not very good. I have tried these and they are very tasty, which I was surprised because some of the combos don't sound like they would taste good (spinach, apple, rutabaga?). I am from Dallas and I get them from a grocery store here called Central Market and they normally sell them at less than $2 but will have sales where you can get them at around $1, so that is when I stock up. The product is excellent, but I think the price you pay on Amazon is very high compared to other places where you can get a better price.

review/summary: Looks and smells gross, but my baby wouldn't stop eating it!
review/text: Our pediatrician recommended this flavor combination when we first started solids because it has 120% of daily iron needs.  Well, when I sat down to feed it to my baby, all I could was, wow, this is so gross!  It looks pretty much the same way going in as it does coming out, if you know what I mean.  To my surprise, my picky eater gobbled it up!  She ate more of this than any other baby food flavor we had offered.  A 2-3oz package of anything else was lasting two days, but she ate almost the whole 3.5oz package of this in one sitting.  I did taste it, and the apples make it sweet and appetizing (and I really do not like spinach).  We've had more success with Ella's Kitchen than any other brand, but this flavor especially has been great.  Looks gross, smells gross, sounds gross, but I say, give it a try.

He loves the taste and of course there is no worry about choking hazards.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because they are extremely pricey, even at the lowest price I could find it really adds up.

I figure that he's going to have so many processed food options in the future that I might as well give him the best I can now.<br /><br />I purchased the Boon Spoons (got a 3 pack of the 2-spoon sets from the big T for less than a 2 pack here on amazon) and they work perfectly with these pouches too. Very convenient to take on the go.<br /><br />I continue to purchase these pouches, though I usually buy a couple individual packs from T before buying the 7 packs here on Amazon so I can make sure he likes them.

review/text: I have been buying Ella since my son was 6 months old. Once I moved back to the States I was pleased to find the Ella product here. I was also buying Gerber Organic and then one day I studied the label and realized that only Ella was truly just pure veg and fruit whereas the other organic baby food as other random things to help the shelf life. Ella is worth the price and is so easy to mix in with chicken or fish to make it easier for your little one. Although my son is now 16months, I still use Ella when I am short on time and don't have time to make fresh veg or fruit.

I had no worry about them leaking (like a small plastic tupperware).  The price is right, shipping was quick, and they store really well in the pantry in the ready made box.

review/text: We love Ella's! Amazingly pure and delicious portable snack. But this price is crazy - it is cheaper at our Whole Foods in Manhattan! Eek!

review/summary: Healthy food, happy Kids, no mess - happy mom too.
review/text: My kids love Ella's Kitchen Apple Banana sauce.  We have purchased various flavors and various brands of this type of product - fruit sauce in a pouch.  There are only a couple they like.  And this is one of their favorites.  They are older children (not babies).  They love the taste and the packaging.  They like it so much that they beg for it.  It is so easy to give this to them in the car.  Healthy food, happy Kids, no mess - happy mom too.

review/summary: LOVE!
review/text: My baby LOVED the Ella's kitchen items, especially the peaches & bananas.  I love that it is all organic!  The consistency is very runny...so it mixes well with things like oatmeal & other baby cereals.  The cap will go back on the package, but must be kept upright in the fridge or it will leak.
