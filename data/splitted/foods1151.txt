review/summary: Freeze Your Toilet Paper
review/text: My first experience with this hot sauce involved watching my college roommate lick the foil lining within the cap of a newly opened bottle. Five minutes later, sitting on the couch with his eyes closed and sweat all over his face, he proceeded to sit completely still for the next 45 minutes before the intense heat finally subsided enough for him to mutter a feeble "Holy $#%*"<br /><br />Sadly, this process was repeated the next morning. But instead of sitting on the couch, he was sitting on the bowl. And instead of silence, sounds that can only otherwise be heard during an exorcism were coming through the bathroom door. Once he had emerged, me and my other roomates stared at him curiously as he uttered these words of wisdom- "We must freeze our toilet paper if we are to ever eat this sauce again"<br /><br />Truer words have never been spoken, folks. As the rest of my roomates and I had our own experiences with Insanity Sauce, the cool, cool relief of an ice cold roll of toilet paper on a burning backside the morning after consuming this sauce, felt like there couldn't possibly be anything better in the world at that point in time. We thanked our roommate for his words of wisdom, and from that point forward, we always had a roll "chilling" in the freezer for subsequent MAD (Morning After Dave's) trips to the bathroom.<br /><br />I should probably add that there isn't much in the flavor department here, but nothing is better for kicking up the heat in anything you are cooking. A must have for 21 year old males everywhere

review/summary: VERY HOT BE CAREFUL
review/text: I ordered this for my dad, as he's used it to make beef jerkey for years.  He ran out over a year ago, and hasn't been able to find it anywhere locally so he was experimenting with other sauces.  Nothing was the same or even comparable to Dave's.  I found it on Amazon for a very decent price and surprised him with it.  He was soooo excited!!  Word of caution though, please read and follow the warning on the bottle.  It is VERY VERY hot.  When it says to start with one drop, seriously, start with one.  This little bottle will last a very long time.  Product shipped very quickly and arrived in excellent condition.  Thank you!

review/text: OK, I love hot sauce and spicy food. My chili can strip paint and clean engine parts. But this stuff is ridiculous.<br /><br />First time I saw it, I sniffed the bottle, thought "not bad", then put a drop the size of a BB on my finger and tasted it. I literally couldn't get my breath, and my tongue was sort of numb for a while. About 1/2 teaspoon to a pot of chili is about right, but do NOT under any circumstances put this stuff directly on food like you would with most hot sauce.

review/summary: This stuff is hot!
review/text: I first bought this about 15 years ago in a spice store, and it is exactly as the name implies. If you like hot sauce, this has to be in your fridge. It may be to strong to use in a large quantity, but it really adds a kick when added to other spices. I've probably tried 2 dozen "hot" sauces that were purchased at a grocery store, none are close to as good, or as hot as Dave's Insanity.

review/summary: Hot sauce
review/text: I love hot foods and sauces and this one lives up to it. I use it in everything and have found I like about 3-4 drops in my foods for the heat, which is way too much for anyone else in my household. However, the only negative, if it even counts, is that too much of the sauce will alter food taste. The heat is fine but there is distinguishable taste that this sauce has and it can overbear the taste of your dish if you use too much. I have learned my dosage for foods so it works perfect for me.

review/summary: This surely Kicks butt
review/text: I'm into hot foods - meaning habenaro and thai chilies are something I can easily eat without a bat of an eyelid. On our recent visit to San Antonio riverwalk mall I came across this brand and asked the lady which one is the hottest and she handed this over to me saying this is not the hottest of them all. And what better way to taste a hot sauce but to use Chicken wings. And Oh My God - first bite into the wing and my tongue started burning. I slowed down and ate all the wings and boy it was so tasty. So if you can sustain incredible heat this is for you. Be VERY CAUTIOUS.

review/text: when i was in the eighth grade i had a math tutor who thought he was a real hard nose. i taught him a life lesson. knowing that his big ego would hurt him, during a session i asked him if he liked hot stuff. "oh yeah", he said, "i love hot stuff!" so i reached for the bottle of dave's insanity sauce my pep-pep gave me. sure enough, my dumbass teacher stuck his whole finger in the bottle and took a big lick.<br /><br />now, back in the day, when i wanted to let people know how serious this stuff was i would dab a little on one prong of a fork and watch them go crazy, so i could only imagine what this guy was about to go through.<br /><br />he kept it in for about ten seconds. "thats pretty hot" he said coolly. within two seconds he bolted to the sink, where he stood with his mouth open under the running faucet for about five minutes. when he finally came back, looked at me and said "that was the hottest thing i ever tasted".<br /><br />you think you like hot stuff? dave's insanity sauce will humble you.

review/summary: This Is HOT - Highly Recommended!
review/text: "Dave's Insanity Sauce" is not to be taken casually or even as a way to add heat to individual servings, this is meant for larger dishes such as a whole pot of chili or a big batch of salsa since one or two drops will make a large amount of food VERY hot. That being said, this does have a really good flavor that adds a nice pepper tangy hit that complements most Mexican or South-Western dishes, but I wouldn't use it in Indian or Chinese style dishes.<br /><br />There are several amusing and somewhat painful to watch videos of people abusing this sauce on various web sites and a quick search will provide you with a lot of hits.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Dave's Insanity Sauce
review/text: The label of this product says it all... THIS IS INSANELY HOT!<br /><br />I remember the first time I tried Dave's, a friend received a bottle for christmas and decided to feed it to us as a joke.  But it wasn't a joke, I almost cried.  The strange thing about Dave's though, is that once you try it and get past the first feelings of inadequacy (YOU CAN't HANDLE THE SAUCE!) you want to go back for round two.  Which is exactly why I bought this product... I craved it.  Maybe that's the insane part?<br /><br />I put this on everything I can, sandwiches, tacos, quesodillas, salads, beans and even now I am eating it on Mac & Cheese.<br /><br />I do recommend this product, with caution.

review/summary: Disappointingly Not Hot Enough
review/text: I bought a bottle of Dave's Original Insanity Hot Sauce after reading reviews that said "Use with caution", "feed your sadistic side", etc.<br /><br />All i can say is: this sauce is definitely NOT hot enough.  i used up 1/4 of the bottle within 24 hours of its arrival on a plate of fries and rice (it's only mildly hotter than habanero tabasco which itself is like tomato ketchup).  I've had much hotter stuff here in Asia.<br /><br />If you claim that you can take hot sauce or are a chilli-head and say that something like this is too hot even for you, you really have no idea what true chilli-heat is because this sauce is really nowhere near as hot as what many claim it to be.  The taste of vinegar comes through a lot more than the heat or any other flavour.  And no, there was absolutely no burn coming out the toilet end as well.<br /><br />Bottom line:  this sauce has only a mild 5/10 heatkick rating by my personal standard. 2 slices of raw chilli-padi rolled around the tongue for 10 seconds is still hotter than this.  Total disappointment!

review/summary: Great for Popcorn
review/text: This review is for the Special Reserce Dave's that is sold in a wooden casket. Way hotter than plain ol' Daves. I too had a near-death experience with Daves. A friend gave me an original bottle of Daves XXX years ago. He always said, "this is the hottest sauce out there". None of the sauses were hot. Without reading the label I downed a heaping teaspoon of the sauce. If I would have read the label I would have seen that it said it could be used as a driveway cleaner. Swallowing it without even touching my lips. It was weird. I didn't feel a thing. About 5 minutes I ran into the bedroom layed down and started doing puppy breaths as if I were giving birth to a demon. My stomach swelled-up like I actually had something living in there trying to get out. My wife came in the room and thought I was going into a coma. She kept on asking, "....what is wrong?". All I could mutter out was, "....bread, bread". I had to scream it so she would take me seriously, although it was difficult because I could barely exhale. It took a while before I exited the bedroom. I was pale. For some reason my son thought he should try it. He wasn't there when I went through my exorcism. He took a half a teaspoon and right from the get go started screaming like a banshee while holding his ears. That year he gave me a signed edition bottle in a casket. It was even more hot the the previous bottle. The bottle lasted for years. My youngest son even took it to school for a cultures class, saying it was part of our culture. When kids tried it they were running around the halls looking for water. Security was called and my son was taken into a room and questioned about the substance. He said, "...it is hot sauce". The security guy said, "...I've never seen hot sauce that does that, now tell me what it is". Dave's sauce has a mythological history in our family.<br />I didn't care for the flavor that much. Melinda's XXX sauce has a great taste and they use habaneros and carrots. Muy delicioso. I am looking forward to trying Dave's Ghost Chili. If I survive that test I will write about it. If you do use Dave's just add a drop or two into your chili or popcorn oil. When you put it into the oil, though, be forewarned - everybody in the house will be coughing! If you want to get a good laugh, have a person shake the bottle before they try it. Let them get how much they want. Trick is, when shaking, they inevitably will get a little something-something onto their fingers. It won't take long before they scratch their nose, rub their eyes or, God forbid, use the restroom.

review/text: Well I just had this for the first time tonight. I used it to dip tater tots in and no it wasn't diluted or watered down. It came straight from the bottle. What I noticed first is the hiccups then the searing heat which was most welcomed. I grew up eating anything and everything as hot as you could get it and I have to say so far this is the hottest hot sauce I have had. Real close to eating ghost peppers fresh. For those who said this was too hot, is it ever really too hot? Seriously.

review/text: Ok heres the deal.  1 pea-sized drop will have ur mouth burning for about a half hour.  It's an "extract" sauce, it says it in the ingredients.  Which means the Capsaicin (the "Hot" compound) has been refined over and over again to produce the extreme heat.  It might be considered cheating, and I'm thinking this is probably what caused it to be kicked out of the National Fiery foods Contest.  The 1 problem here is that if your looking for flavor, you cant get enough of it because you can only use a little portion.  It's great to spice up weaker sauces.  Use it as an additive.  It will last a long time.  Bottle states it needs refrigeration after opening.

However, I will warn anyone who is going to buy this because I was putting about 5-8 drops on everything I was eating for about 3 days and for the next week my stomach was in pain. With the amount of sauce I put in my food my eyes would water with every bite, my face was bright red, and I was sweating. So if you want to experience some great and insane hot sauce the I would recommend this. My next purchase of Dave's Insanity Sauce will be the Ghost Pepper sauce.

review/summary: Too Many One-Sided Reviews
review/text: Okay, so I've read a lot of the reviews posted here on Amazon and it sure seems many claim this as a "cooking additive" or to use sparingly. I however find this to be a great hot sauce, but not to the point where you are at any jeopardy should you use this as an actual hot sauce on day to day food either. I myself live for hot sauce so have probably developed a tolerance of some sort. This sauce is indeed HOT. If you are not a consistent hot sauce user of hotter variety then this will be most likely hot for you. But if you are like me and order the hottest wings or the spiciest dishes or enjoy true hot flavor then this will most likely be a 7 out of 10 on the hot scale. I myself use this on single serving everyday meals as I would Tobasco. IE; Sandwiches, pastas, burritos, soups, anything you would normally add sauce too. Sure I cook with it too, but it can be used as a regular hot sauce. Yes, you should use a couple drops until you develop a tolerance. At this point I go through about a bottle a week, I use it that much several times a day. Hell I even have a video on youtube eating 2 tablespoons straight of the stuff...again its hot but not as bad as some people make it out to be!  See it for yourself go to youtube and search "Dave's Insanity Bitch Slap".

I wanted go get a good hot sauce and after reading the reviews here how this stuff will practically set your mouth on fire I eagerly ordered it. Maybe it's just me but when I tried just a drop of this sauce as reccomended, yes it was hot, and somewhat painful all around my tongue, lips and throat, but certainly tolerable. Ii feel I can casually put this stuff in my food.  then took about a teaspoon and put it on my tongue, i could feel my whole face sweating and my tongue burning. Drinking water didn't help. But the burning feeling goes away in less than a minute and you can start eating the sauce again. The taste itself is not very good but luckily i intend to use it really as an ingredient. If you think this is the hottest thing in the universe I feel sorry for you in a way because I'm sure there are hotter things out there.

review/text: I tried this sauce for the first time in SC a few months ago because my cousin Steven was talking about it. I rolled a couple of toothpicks in it and put it straight on my tongue to try it out and I was dipping my tacos and chips in it. I have had spicier.  I am from SoCal and that is normal for a lot of the mexican places I eat at. The only thing the sauce did was make my face sweat a little... As far as the burn in my mouth it was no hotter than the fried peppers you can pick up at any authentic mexican restaurant out here. I probably had the equivalent of a teaspoon in less than a half hour. I did not have to drink anything after it. The taste was okay. The only reason why I put it on my food was because it was the only spicy sauce in the house. It is a potent sauce... a little goes a long way but I was sorely disappointed by heat of it... maybe because it was because of all the hype.

If you really want an extreme burn with good flavor try the after burner sauce from a company called Son-in-law out of Michigan.

It was awful, and it ruined a $ 6 . 50 burrito.

I eat Naga Jolokia sauce on a daily basis and this doesn't quite reach the same heat level and the taste is really bad in comparison.  I'm not a fan of the extract flavor and I suggest trying a Naga Jolokia sauce if eating on an individual meal.  I haven't tried this in a pot of food so maybe in that sense it works well but that's not what I use it for.

review/summary: Too Hot for me...
review/text: My one and only experience with this hot sauce was during a roadtrip to the coast.  I had packed my special blend of homemade Bloody Mary fixin's to enjoy in our Hotel.  Unfortunately,  this time I included "Dave's Insanity Sauce" which I had unwittingly bought for my husband who likes it hot.  Once we hit our room I made two potent Mary's & not knowing what to expect barely dipped toothpick in  Insanity Sauce & swirled it into my  cocktail.<br />Immediately  upon my 1st sip FLAMES began shooting though my left ear "CARTOON STYLE"...<br />It hurt so bad I thought I was going to have to go to E.R. Nearly ruined my entire weekend... On our last day in Monterey we found this little shop called Slow Burn (alas no longer open) which was packed to the brim with hot sauces from all over.. I would say there were at least 10 different bottles to sample. To my delight some actually had distinct flavor rather than just hotness and pain. My favorite was a little bottle that had a sombrero for a cap, (not sure the name) but yum! The owner explained to me why the Insanity Sauce caused me such pain. He thought it might be sugar that caused the heat to stick.  They're not all like that. I don't see sugar listed in the ingredients listed here though...

review/summary: The Only One I Avoid.
review/text: Well, I guess I'm the fly in this reviewer ointment, but Dave's is the only hotsauce that I won't buy. It has a synthetic quality to it and a flavor that is almost non-existent. This is due to its being made directly from capsaicin extract as opposed to actual peppers. It offers a nuclear level of heat that seems to be a recipe for ulcers in my opinion. According to Wikipedia, its Scoville heat (fire) index rates out 50,000 units which can be contrasted with Tobasco's 2,500 to 5,000 rating. Who needs that much heat? Not me or most human beings. This stuff is lethal. No thanks.

This stuff may not be poison but it isn't food in my opinion. What kind of people make a dopey product like this? There is a mild warning and a caution to use a drop at a time but that warning is inadequate.<br /><br />It was about 10 minutes of legitimate suffering that was completely unnecessary.<br /><br />Don't buy this junk!

review/summary: A healthy hot beverage that tastes great
review/text: I specifically searched for a green tea that contained ginseng and Amazon led me to this one, which I purchased.  The package contains three tins with 20 bags in each, each containing a generous 5 grams of the blend.  It isn't simply green tea with ginseng; it also includes Gen Mai Cha (whatever that is...) and lemongrass.  The combo tastes great and it is smooth.  In fact, I prefer the taste over plain green tea.<br /><br />But the main reason I purchased it is to obtain fodder to brew up a "Healthy" hot drink for us men with Type "O" blood.  According to the health gurus, both green tea and ginseng are almost "Medicinal" for us types.  Well, time will tell on that claim, but what is immediately clear to me is that this tea goes down smoothly and gives me no detrimental side effects like my prior hot beverage, coffee, did.  Apparently, the Gen Mai Cha and the Lemongrass produce nothing noticeably detrimental, at least in the short-term.<br /><br />My only complaint about this tea is that it comes in bags.  I prefer loose tea, but I can, and do, live with using bags for all the other teas our household purchases.<br /><br />All in all, I am very pleased with the purchase.  Try it for yourself, especially if you have type "O" blood.  You may like it as much as I do.

review/summary: A Quality Green Tea Blend
review/text: I ordered this product during a promotional sale. I'm a fan of green tea and organic groceries, so I thought I'd give this tea a shot. While it was different from what I was expecting, I ended up being very happy with this tea.<br /><br />The product's description lists it as "Green With Ginseng Tea". However, it is a blend of Chinese green tea, Gen Mai Cha, lemongrass, and ginseng. This combination makes it taste distinctly different from traditional green tea (the lemongrass really adds something different), which threw me for a surprise. However, I enjoyed the blend even thought it was not what I was expecting.<br /><br />The product comes in small tins, making it ideal for travel. I brought some with me on a trip to Southeast Asia, which came in very handy for when I did not have access to quality teas and coffees.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with the taste and quality of this product. Just don't expect a traditional green tea flavor.

Not only does it make a healthier spread for bread, it's also great on pancakes or waffles, and I've even used it as a condiment for pork chops and roasts.

review/summary: good, but not great
review/text: When I first started to buy VitaGravy, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.

review/summary: Great dog food convenient
review/text: When we got our German Shepherd his parents were being fed this food and he was getting the puppy version of it.  After doing a little research I've found that this is a good quality dog food.  And it's specifically engineered for German Shepherds which have notoriously sensitive stomachs. I've tried other foods and with this one my dogs coat looks a lot healthier and he has more energy. It also lasts longer than a #40 bag of the cheap dog food since he doesn't have to eat as much to get full. I used to get this food at Petsmart but I have to drive 40 min either east or west from where I live to get to a Petsmart so I found it to be incredibly convenient to be able to order on Amazon. I still buy it at Petsmart but I don't have to make special trip just for dog food anymore. And with Amazon Prime I can get it shipped for free and it only cost about $3 more than at Petsmart but it cost more than that in gas to drive there. I've bought this here several times and will continue to buy it here since it's so convenient.

review/summary: My Dogs Love It
review/text: I've been through the research and unending label-checking to find a dog food that I was content feeding them, only to find out that my picky eater would turn her nose up at the food.  The other couldn't care less and literally inhales his food.  I went through all the varieties of Nutro, which is a well-balanced food with plenty of whole-meat proteins and whole grains, but all she would eat was enough to stave off hunger.  When I finally decided that I could drop another $10 per bag, I tried Royal Canin and both of my dogs love it.  The ingredients are high quality, the dogs eat it enthusiastically and the size of the kibble is large enough that my "Inhaler" chews his food thoroughly before he tries swallowing. It's expensive, but the bag lasts us two weeks with two big dogs eating 5 cups per day.  So, about $30 per week, $4 a day or $2 per dog per day.  I'm okay with that.

review/text: Our GSD is about two years old and has a very fragile digestive system (as many GSD). After trying the best in holistic food for dogs and spent a lot of money we decided to give Royal Canin a try. We were not convinced because it is not a brand highly recommended by various dog food web sites but it was still a reasonable brand. After about 8 months of using Royal Canin for GSD our dog is in perfect health. She has gained weight, she eats with appetite and obviously with pleasure.  We decided to stick with this brand.

review/text: My dad was feeding my German shepherd the cheapest bag of dog food from costco for the past 2 years.  I brought my dog to the Vet  and the vet was appalled with the condition that my dog was in.  His skin was red/pink all over, and his coat lacked luster.  I switched to this food because my vet recommended it, and it was the best switch!  My 4 year old german shepherd eats slower because the kibble is much bigger and is shaped like an X.  His coat has shine, and did not have any issues with digestive problems, like we had when we switched foods.  Royal Canin is a little pricey, but worth the price for a healthy pet.

review/summary: Formulated Specifically for German Shepherds
review/text: I have owned German Shepherds for almost twenty years.  I love their intelligence and loyalty, but have been dismayed with the delicate nature of their digestive system.  I was so pleased to discover Royal Canin, and amazed that they make breed specific dog foods!  I have had both piggers (who wolf down their food) and pickers (who have to be tempted into eating).  I love the fact that the kibble is shaped like little crosses which helps slow down the piggers while it tastes good enough to tempt the appetite of the pickers.  I have been using Royal Canin for about ten years now and have been extremely happy with it.  But once in a while I wonder if there is something better so I go to the dog food rating websites out there on the internet.  Be careful - I have noticed that quite a few of them do not accurately reflect the ingredients listed on the German Shepherd 24 bag (or the Royal Canin website).  I don't think I will be switching dog foods any time soon! :)

It was a hit and he now enjoys eating. I would highly recommend the Royal Canin line of foods for your dog.

This is after I read reviews on it, and discovered it has some bad reviews.  It has lots of fillers in it.  I prefer a more natural, healthier dog food (this is my opinion after what I've read).  There are good websites to compare pet foods and read professional reviews on them.

review/text: I bought this popcorn for my wife along with an air popper for her birthday.  I was actually surprised to see that the different colors of corn do pop into popcorn that are different textures.  My favorite is the red corn, while my wife likes the yellow.  All three varieties taste great and have great texture.  However, I am not sure if it is totally worth the higher price compared to popcorn you would buy in the store.  The only other complaint I have is that the kernels are smaller than traditional kernels you'd buy at the store, so they tend to blow out of the air popper unpopped more than other kernels.

review/summary: Cheese and Garlic - Flavorful and Tasty
review/text: My wife is in love with this cheesy garlicky spread. I am the garlic lover and she is not, which baffles me a bit. I love the smell of the stinky rose as they call it, when I cook or when it is fried that comes with some peanuts. It is a very tasty and I would say, although not an expert on cheese, that it is on the side of the gourmet. What I don't like about it is its crumbly texture. Instead of spreading smoothly on bread or cracker, it crumbles apart. In the box, the product is nicely wrapped in a classy aluminum foil.  Make sure to shop around for price.

review/summary: The most bitter Hollandaise EVER!
review/text: I've made my own Hollandaise for many years based on several recipes I was able to garner from some of the 5 star restaurant's chefs, and they were all palate pleasers. I decided to try a bottled one in order to save the time it takes to make it at home. After reading the 1st and only review for this product (which was a 5 star...I think the customer might have been trying to get someone else sucked into buying it!), I decided to try it. I purchased 4 jars. BIG mistake! This is the WORST TASTING Hollandaise I could ever imagine! Tried it at room temp, then tried heating it to see if the bitter taste would go away but to no avail. This stuff is horrible! The only nice thing about the product is the shape of the jar. I'm going to make a huge batch of my own home made Hollandaise and store it in the jars. Thought about giving the three unopened jars away, but I don't have any enemies I hate THAT much! I poured their contents down the toilet (hope it doesn't ruin my sewage system!) and thoroughly washed the bottles for my own use.<br />If you're looking to have a great Hollandaise sauce at home, I highly recommend you MAKE it at home!

review/summary: The Lazy Man's Hollandaise
review/text: This is a really fine hollandaise that keeps indefinitely in the fridge after being opened, or on the shelf before opening.  It's just the ticket for a quick Eggs Benedict.  The maker's Bearnaise is not always available, but to turn this into a creamy Bearnaise, all you have to do is microwave some tarragon in a tablespoon of butter, then stir in the Hollandaise.<br /><br />I have been buying this product at Whole Foods for years, but I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, which saves me a longish drive.  This is a dream product that lets the home cook prepare some really special dishes, and I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Very Tasty but Very Hot
review/text: This pasta sauce is like marinara sauce with a generous dose of Tobasco sauce added, perhaps even hotter.  I love spicy food, so I don't mind it, but be aware of that before you serve it to your unsuspecting guests who might even nod along when you asked them if they like their food a little spicy.<br /><br />In other words, it's more suitable for Cinco de Mayo (Day of the Dead) fiesta than Thanksgiving dinner.<br /><br />In our family, we put mussels and other seafood into the sauce and the combination is excellent.  Maybe it'll work as marinate for chicken wings, and then BBQ on a grill, or bake them in the sauce in an oven.  I guess I should try those out.

review/summary: The only place I could find Diet Cream Soda
review/text: Well there's not a whole lot I can say about it. If you like Cream Soda and drink diet soda in general, you'll love this.  If you don't like either, you'll hate it.  My wife doesn't like diet soda in general but will drink it, however she hates Splenda and all the natural tasting sweeteners so she really hated this stuff. Her complaint however was that it was too sweet.<br /><br />I've put the sodastream in the office and let everyone use it and it's extremely popular among the diet soda drinkers in the office.  You can look high and low, finding diet cream soda is rare indeed so it was a huge bonus that Sodastream featured it.  I couldn't speak any better of it and like I said, if you like Cream and Diet soda, you'll absolutely love this.

I need good caffeine free/sugar free non acidic ( not fruit flavored ) drinks for my medical conditions. I usually buy waist watchers cream soda but I recently moved and can't get it in this state. I guess my BF will have to keep shipping it to me from PA because soda stream's version is undrinkable. I hope they re-do the recipe because a GOOD diet cream soda would be one of their biggest sellers. This is a shame.

These two happen to be the worst tasting of the bunch, with the diet cream soda being so bad it's in a class of its own.  Tasted like perfume or gasoline or something.  I literally gagged.<br /><br />The whole thing is going back.  I knew it wasn't going to save me money but at least I'd stop drinking out of cans.  They are so far from comparable it is laughable.  Knock-off brands at Walmart or Aldi taste better.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed.

review/text: I literally could not live without the Monthly Comfort tea. A friend recommended it to me for "the time of the month" and I tried it skeptically - especially as I am not a mother, a soon to be mother, or motherly at all. I start drinking at least a cup of this three to four days before my cycle, and find that most of the monthly annoyance of being a woman subsides. What was a week of unpleasantness, with two days of insomnia because the pain is so bad has no turned into a day or two max of light cramps, with no bloating either.<br /><br />To me it tastes like cinnamon and ginger, with raspberry undertones. It tastes delicious enough that I often have it all month long, not just on my cycle. It's especially pleasant on a chilly morning.<br /><br />I buy this in bulk now, because running out is simply not an option!

review/text: I've battled horrific periods for years, especially after the birth of my second child.  I wish I would have known about this many years ago!  This tea is absolutely fantastic.  I typically have issues with gaining upwards of 10 lbs of water weight during my menstrual cycle - not this time.  Cramping is significantly reduced, water weight is non-existent, even my husband commented on my much improved monthly demeanor.<br /><br />The tea is easy to make, though I would certainly recommend steeping for a solid 15 minutes for best results.  I drink two cups of this tea each day (morning and afternoon) starting a few days before my cycle and all the way through.  I do not normally enjoy tea, but I have to say, this is delicious.  I didn't even need to add sugar or other sweetener to mask the taste.<br /><br />I have used most of the Earth Mama tea products, and have been impressed by the high quality, delicious flavors, and natural remedies for my ails.  I highly recommend giving this product a try.

review/text: I cannot abide plain coffee so I've been sampling all the flavored coffees for our new Keurig machine. Some have just been too strong for me, too bitter, or too chemically tasting. (Husband calls me Coffee goldilocks) So I was delighted to realize the Folgers Caramel Drizzle was just right. Sort of a smooth, silky feel in the mouth, mild to medium roast and not too strong at all. The caramel flavor is light and not overwhelming, but it smells GREAT while brewing. It's not quite sweet enough for me (that being said, it IS lightly sweet on it's own). I added a teaspoon of sugar to a 7 ounce cup and literally a splash of milk and it was perfect. Fortunately this is also available regularly at our local grocery store as well as Amazon. And for less than the third party sellers are offering it.

review/text: We haven't used these to bake yet (although we will soon with Halloween right around the corner).  However I opened and tasted the spring green color and it tastes good and a little unusual - remember it is colored with spinach - I think it tastes like turbinado sugar, which we all love in my house. I think once it is baked it will taste just like regular sugar cookies. The sugar is made up of sugar crystals, it is not the refined granules we are all used to which I think will add a fun touch to the decorating process for the kids.  My kids have a strong reaction to regular dyes in colored sugar and other unaturally colored products, so I was very happy to discover this product.  India Tree also makes naturally colored food dyes which would be good for frostings and such.  We haven't tried it yet, but I am going to order that next.

review/summary: The Best Money can Buy for your Cat, Next to Homemade - Revised for Turkey
review/text: I like to provide variety for the cats, however, I like to stick with single protein sources.  So in addition to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.

review/summary: My three male cats love this!!
review/text: So far, my three male kitties have loved all the Wellness wet foods I've bought for them.  However, they really went wild over this, and it's become a real favorite.

review/summary: Smells fishy, so the cats love it
review/text: I only buy Wellness for my cats and I try to give them a variety, so I've tried most of the flavors. The sardine seafood blend is by far the worst smelling flavor the cats have tried. And of course it's their favorite. They lick the bowl on this one. It's definitely a good pick for older cats that need softer food (mushy) or finicky eaters.

review/summary: Very high quality food, and cat likes it
review/text: I recently did a bunch of research on Cat nutrition, and my conclusion was that the Wellness cat foods offered the best combination of excellent nutrition, good variety, and affordability.  So I bought some for my crotchety, picky, 16+ year old cat who had been eating Nutro.  To my great relief, she accepted the switch without complaint!<br /><br />Although I haven't had a long history with this cat food yet, I've been pleased with the results so far, and based on my research I'm convinced I'm doing right by my furry friend.  I certainly recommend it.

review/summary: difficult to review for a cat but...
review/text: The product seemed great from the human viewpoint: high protein, no grain, quality ingredients and relatively reasonably priced on Amazon. However, my cats would not touch the food. I have one, older female, slightly fussy part Maine coon and a second, very large young male, an outdoor stray who has adopted us. Neither of them would eat it, both preferred the dry food  (Wellness Salmon). I usually give them both wet and dry food. The wet food, a different brand, is always eaten first but this time, both bowls of Wellness Canned cat food were left pretty much untouched after the first taste and remained so until I tossed the food the next day! I know cats are very particular ...they often dislike something for no reason I can understand and it doesn't necessarily imply a faulty product ...  but if a young, hungry stray decides against it, in this case, I reckon something is off with the product.

review/summary: She must be a picky eater.
review/text: My cat barely touches this stuff, especially after the can's been open for about a day or two. This is probably because she was most likely raise on cheap food (we adopted her as an adult) but I can't be sure. Apparently healthy food is less appealing to cats...

review/summary: Cat loves this and it's a high quality food
review/text: I have a 1 1/2 year old cat and started feeding him canned food after reading about how cats don't naturally have a strong thirst drive and need most of their water to come from their food like in nature. Also as another reviewer said, this food doesn't have any of the crappy by-products that "Science Diet" and other highly marketed brands have. These brands even have by-products in their canned food.<br /><br />Cats are carnivores so the majority of their diet needs to be meat (aside from the small amount of veggies you might find in a mouse's or rabbit's stomach in the wild).<br /><br />Aside from that, my cat LOVES this food and it is very good for him. He eats a variety of flavors so he doesn't get sick of one.

review/summary: My cats love this stuff
review/text: I've been feeding my cats wellness since I weaned the stray kitten and got the shelter kitten, and they seem to like all the flavours plenty but I've been alternating this and the straight chicken stuff for the past few weeks and they've basically stopped eating the chicken stuff, I guess saving space for this stuff instead.

review/summary: Thie Best Money can Buy for your Cat, Next to Homemade - Revised
review/text: I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.<br /><br />Edit: I've added to the review after it appeared Product Not Available.  If you hit create review, THEN hit Edit review, apparently it takes.

review/summary: Good Cat Food
review/text: My cats do like the food, although when I first started to feed them they kind of picked at it. Now I feed them only this food and a little bit of the dry food from this company and its no problem. My one cat was over weight and he is now more active and running around with the other cats and he looks much healthier and younger. I have one cat that vomits a lot and have had to buy special vet food, which helped him stop vomiting and he can eat this food too with no problem. I will say that the cats do like the chicken and herring recipe better, I think they like fish in general more then poultry. I do highly recommend this food, its worth the price, considering the vet food is just as expensive and there are lots of pork by-products and low quality grains in the ingredient list.

review/summary: My Cats Health Improved with This Food
review/text: I rescued three cats that were suffering from malnutrition.  I started feeding them wellness canned chicken cat food in small portions mixed with organic chicken broth.  I fed them a  few times a day, and within  a week they had more energy, and were putting on weight.  Within a month their coat was soft and shinny.  These cats did a total turn around and I believe that this fine food saved their lives.  I continued feeding the cats this food  because I am confident that the high protein and natural antioxidants will keep my cats healthy and it will also keep the cats hydrated.  I am very pleased with this food.  It is the next best thing to a raw diet.<br />Wellness Complete Health Canned Cat Food, Chicken Recipe (Pack of 12 12.5-Ounce Cans)

review/summary: Purr-fect!
review/text: I haven't bought Wellness through Amazon yet, but the prices are very competitive and will do so.  After discovering they carried Wellness, wanted to comment on the product.  When I adopted my cat, she came with unrevealed health problems.  She was on a nebulizer every day, no energy, vomiting and more.  As one reviewer stated, I did some internet research.  I tried some of the top of the line natural foods.  Once I got her on the Wellness wet food, her health was a complete turnaround.  She's twelve and acts like four or five years of age.  No more health problems.  The consistency is smooth, a potential problem for a lot of cats that won't eat chunky foods.  I absolutely can not recommend this food more highly.  The dry, is very small pieces and she's slow to eat it, but I keep it as a 'treat' food.  The wet is perfect in every way.

review/summary: My cat loves this stuff
review/text: Over the past 2 weeks I've been transitioning my 10 month old cat from dry to wet food. This is the only wet food that he really eats with enthusiasm. I really think it helped in the transition. We've also tried Wellness Core and EVO (also high quality foods) but he likes this stuff the best.

review/summary: My cats LOVE this food!
review/text: Both of my cats run to their bowl like it's treat time when I open a can of this flavor of Wellness cat food. They are really picky too.  This flavor is much juicer, has more 'gravy' in it than all the other flavors we've tried. I've even been able to put some liquid antibiotic in the gravy and it gets gobbled up.  That was a real treat for me-not having to bother with the syringe dosing!
