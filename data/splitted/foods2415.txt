review/summary: These are NOT the spicy Slim Jims!
review/text: The box in the picture for the Slim Jims sold here says "Spicy Smoked Snacks." They are not! The item you receive is a box of the original flavor. The only reason I purchased from this seller is because he advertised the spicy slim jims. I could have purchased the orginal slim jims cheaper from someone else. Buyer beware!

Since so many talked about the count of Slim Jim's, I actually counted them. The box I counted had 108 with 3 of these just being sealed empty packaging. I will buy these again.

It's has the perfect marketing campaign and the colorful red and yellow almost matches the Hulkster's tights!  The small size version of these beef links has a good dose of oil.  You can practically squeeze out the oil in a stick so I get a napkin and press down on it and you'll be amazed of how much oil goes into your blood veins.  But, would I trade that for the beefy taste, HECK NO!  Meat-lovers unite!  Get your daily dose of MSG and Sodium Nitrate, both which are cancer causing agents!  Ye-Haw!

review/summary: A delicious, mouth-watering meat stick!
review/text: Ever since I was a child I have loved Slim Jim Meat Sticks.  The slightly spicy juice that comes out each time you snap into one of these bad boys is enough to convert even the hardest heart.  True, they do leave a waxy residue in your mouth, and it helps to drink something with it to wash it down, but you can't deny the flavor.  The smooth, exciting design of the meat stick makes it feel good in your mouth, as there are no jagged or rough edges, as is normal in your run-of-the-mill jerky-type snacks.  Plus, they are fun to eat!  I have never had such a great time as when I'm ramming meat stick after meat stick into my mouth, and sucking the juice out of this tasty meat.  They're so much fun to eat that you can stay home all night just eating these, and still have a better time than if you were to go out on the town.  In fact, I have considered throwing Slim Jim Meat Stick parties, where all we do is gather together and eat meat sticks.  I'm entirely serious about this.  They are that good!  And with Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature, you don't even have to worry about constantly re-ordering them.  You can have them sent automatically to your house every month!  A great deal for a great snack!

review/text: Slim Jims may taste ok but that's because they are so greasy. That's what helps the flavor. I can't figure out why anyone would like these as I can't seem to chew them to a point where I feel comfortable to swallow. It's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat.  The amount of fat, cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky. I'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff. At least I can chew the beef jerky.

review/summary: Get the original while it lasts
review/text: After the popularity of the Slim Jim waned in the years following revelations that the alleged "macho" of its celebrity endorser was merely spray-on tan, we endured a series of tasteless and unsnappable tinkerings to the original recipe.<br /><br />Sadly, by the early days of this century, the original recipie had been lost. Even a team of scientists hired to reconstruct the glory of Slim Jims past failed in their efforts. We feared we would never see the likes of the "skinny james" of our youth.<br /><br />Happily, a warehouse cellar of the original was located near Hoboken, NJ. How the store had gone missing more than 30 years ago is not known. But, like fine wine, these Slim Jims have only improved with age. Get yours before they're gone!

review/summary: Bursting with goo....
review/text: I ordered these because I wanted to try something new due to me being on a low carb diet.  I love slim jims, but these nach flavored ones are not for everyone.  Every time you take a bite, a burst of gooey, greasy cheese explodes in your mouth.  Not a sensation I enjoy.  Slim jims are greasy enough without having that extra "oomph" packed in.<br /><br />Ill give it an extra star  due to being able to bite around the cheese and eat the tasty slim jim w/ out the cheese.

review/text: A great product at a great price.  These little slim jim snacks taste much better than the full version sold in convenience stores.  Not sure why, but they do.  Others have written the same thing.  Very convenient box and easy to store.  Makes a great adder for school lunches and etc, or just a quick snack on the run.

review/summary: Good in moderation.
review/text: Sometimes you want a snack with a little substance (albeit mechanically seperated chicken and MSG), and Slim Jim's satisfy that craving. I polished off the box in about a month and I don't regret the purchase one bit. You probably should go easy on them if you buy them though. Whatever spicy juice or grease these things are packed with can become unpleasant if you go through more than 3 or 4 of these in a short period. I averaged about 3 a day and sometimes it was just what i needed to shut my stomach up during a boring meeting.

review/text: My Husband and his fellow soldiers love that I send snacks like the Slim-Jims because they are always appreciative of a quick, easy snack during their training exercises and on road marches. I prefer to buy in bulk, so that I know they are stocked, even temporarily. These meat sticks are thoroughly enjoyed, and the price can't be beat.

review/summary: Kids Love Them
review/text: I have ordered these on numerous occasions because the kids love them.  The sticks are a little small, but they allow you to eat four (serving size 4 pieces) with 160 calories.  The fat is a different matter - 1g of trans fat and 6g of saturated fat - 14 total grams of fat per serving.  Obviously not a great health choice if you are going to go through the box in one sitting.  That having been said, they taste great and sometimes are the only thing that hits the spot when you are craving a salty meaty snack.  We throw one in to our youngest kid's lunch box and it makes her day.

I couldn't get it to break down - it was like chewing gum! For the next one, I tried stripping off the outside, but that didn't make any difference. Still tough. I found they were easier to eat if I took tiny bites.<br /><br />That said, they were very tasty. But I don't like to fight my food, so I won't be buying this little stick any more.

review/summary: If you like Slim Jims and/or Tabasco, then these babies are fantastic. Hot, but delicious. A+!!!
review/text: This review is in reference to the 18 count pack of Tabasco flavored Monster Slim Jim's, although any size of the Tabasco Slim Jims are GREAT. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQE3HS">Slim Jim Giant Smoked Snacks, Tabasco, 0.97-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 24)</a>)<br /><br />  I love Tabasco sauce, and love the amazing synergy products they have made with other companies. So when I saw Tabasco Slim Jims, being a fan of Slim Jims anyway, I had to try them. The smaller sized ones, which I have been unable to find here on Amazon, taste great, but they are somewhat tougher than the larger versions, though not in a bad way. The medium sized and large ones, which this review is about, are much softer. Regardless, they are ALL delicious. They have the same spicy flavor that we Tabasco lovers have come to crave, but at the same time, since it was mixed in with other ingredients, it isn't so hot that you are forced to stop eating no matter how good it tastes. My friends and I all agree that it does have a high heat factor to it, and people who don't like spicy stuff might find it too much. But if you like spicy foods, these are an AMAZING snack. If you haven't tried them, then I highly recommend you get one from your grocery or convenient store. If you like them, buy them here since they are cheaper in bulk. Fans of Tabasco will not be disappointed. That's my $.02 on the matter folks.<br /><br />  Thanks you so much for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell

The first time the slim jims were moist and plump and oily and you could tell they were fresh. This second batch was hard and dried out and not oily at all. For those who like slim jims you know what I mean about them being plump and oily as opposed to hard and dried out without much oil.<br /><br />This is the ONLY place I can get the HOT ones so I was dissappointed with the second batch, while the first batch was perfect! I will continue to buy these but may see baout buying from a different seller to get fresher ones.

review/summary: Low carb, spicy snack sticks
review/text: I've loved Slim Jims since I was a kid in the 70s, and these are just the way I remember them - a little greasy, chewy, a little spicy.  This box of 100 contains the small sized sticks - about 4 inches long, individually wrapped, and stored in a dispenser box.  They don't have to be refrigerated, which makes them easy to tuck into a purse or lunch box.<br /><br />These aren't the "spicy" flavor - I think you have to order the jalapeno or tabasco flavor to get those.  But these are *slightly* spicy, chewy and delicious.  Nobody eats Slim Jims because they're health food - they contain preservatives and low grade meats.  But for a quick snack or if you just want something spicy, these are the same yummy snacks you'll remember from your childhood.  They are also high protein and zero carbs, which is good for those who are dieting.<br /><br />I've ordered this box three times and have been happy with it every time.  Free shipping with Amazon's Supersaver Shipping makes it a good deal.  And if you sign up for automatic delivery (no obligation to keep getting it past the first shipment) you will save an additional 15%, making each stick about 20 cents apiece.

review/summary: the nacho flavor is vague but delicious
review/text: if you like slim jims, these have just a hint of nacho cheese flavor. personally, i find them quite delicious. giants are about 14" long, so this 24 box should last me a least a couple of weeks.

review/summary: Slim Jims in the big box
review/text: I have begun buying Slim Jims in a large box to save money over individual purchase by the stick.  Part of my low carb diet.  They make a good between meal snack and the .28 ounce size works well.  I suppose you either like the taste or not.  I like the spiciness as compared to Jack Links, but the texture (finely ground and extruded into a stick) seems a bit less like real meat.  All in all, a good product.

review/summary: Delicioso!
review/text: I originally bought these for myself to relive the nostalgia of consuming one of my favorite snacks of the 90's (R.I.P. Randy Savage). Little did I know how fast the box would run out, these are a huge hit when we have friends and family over. Each jerky stick is roughly a bite size version of the huge sticks you see at your local kwik-e-mart, and 100 sounds like a lot but it isn't - I find myself having to buy these nearly once a month.

review/text: Having never ordered food online before, I was a little leery. However, I decided to take the leap as my husband's birthday was approaching and Slim Jim's are one of his favorites. The cost was no more than buying at a brick and mortar store and the product arrived with excellent freshness. The handy box they come in make for neat storage in the pantry. Not a downside to be had! I would definitely buy again.

review/summary: Take note
review/text: I was a bit confused as to why there were two very similar listings for Arrowhead Mills Shredded Wheat. Since this particular listing had a slightly lower price per ounce, I ordered it. It turned out to be sweetened shredded wheat. (Sweetened with "evaporated cane juice," according to the label.)<br /><br />Not a problem for me -- in fact, it's quite a tasty snack -- but people might want to know.<br /><br />So deducting two stars in rating is for omitting "sweetened" in the listing, not for the product itself.

review/summary: Indeed, it's the sweetened kind
review/text: As the other reviewer said, this is the SWEETENED shredded wheat.  You might have guessed this fact from the ingredients list or the picture shown, but Amazon could eliminate a lot of confusion by adding the word "Sweetened" to the product name and description.<br /><br />This might be the ONLY VEGETARIAN frosted shredded wheat you can find (the others use gelatin, I guess to bind the frosting).  It is a tasty and quality product.  My only complaint is that the frosting dissolves once the milk is added, so eat quick if you prefer the frosting on the cereal.

review/text: I have a 2 yr old and a 4yr old and this cereal is perfect for their small hands and mouths and it's all natural too!  It's really hard to find an all natural cereal without all the added junk.  This cereal only has 3 ingredients (organic whole grain wheat, natural cane sugar, and vitamin E).  The kids love it as a snack or for a healthy breakfast.  It may not be as sweet as it's competitors, but what's wrong with that?  Who needs all that sugar?!

The quality is consistent, and the taste is comparable to other brands, but keep in mind that this product is not pumped full of sugar, so it won't be as sweet as the national brand.

review/summary: Shocked by Price & Contents
review/text: I was thoroughly shocked by the price and contents of the Blue Buffalo Wilderness Dog Jerky Treats package.  $9.99 is too much for 3.5 ounces.  I opened the package and there were about 4 square pieces and the rest crumbs.  Not only that the description didn't indicate 3.5 ounces.  Needless to say I won't be buying this product for my ShihTzu again - way too expensive for what you get.

review/text: MY Cocker Spaniel loves only certain treats she is very picky. We had a sample of the Dogswell Minis Chicken Breast with Mint and Parsley and she loved them. So I ordered yours and they are not the Minis they are strips whick I have to break into small pieces to keep her from eating too much. She takes Pred for skin condition and weight is a concern.<br />She liked the regular Chicken Minis too. I hope you get some of the real Minis ones in soon.<br />Also the large bages of the Happy Hips w/ glucosomine along with the small bags. She likes those too--good for her I want to believe.<br />I love Amazon and hope to do more business with you in the future. Keep up the competitive pricing we need it today for sure.<br />Thanks!<br />CJC in Florida<br /><br />PS A big fan of Dogswell too.

review/summary: These are not as good as they look!
review/text: My dog loves pumpkin-based canned food on his staple kibble (with warm water on top all mixed in to make it a meal...like hot soup), but he doesnt care for these. i spent a lot of money on these too. they are very light and airy, so 3 ounces is like a decent size canister. the shipper was good though. write me here on amazon me if you want to buy these from me. they are fresh and purchased April 2011 and will be stored in a cool, dry, dark place now. oh, i have a golden (if that matters). I rated it 3 because it looks nutritious and all, but he just doesn't like theflavor, as it may be too "strong"...probably just a matter of taste. But on a related note, DO try the dog treats that are called ark naturals brushless chewable toothpaste. they work great and are actually treats! i may write a review for those. i think there are 2 reviews for those thus far. its a relatively new product thats just catching on and heard about it from my local pet store, where the large bag was $28, plus tax!. he likes those a lot and he gets 1 at night and it made his teeth white, gums pink and breath fresh! and they are not minty so they dont smell bad and pungent. i didnt have to have my dogs teeth professionally cleaned...which is a lot of money, and most want to put your dog under(?)!!! got to go... bye now, and thanks for reading my review! peace! Ruff!

review/summary: Misrepresented
review/text: I purchased this Cherry Jubilee Cobbler Mix as a gift.  I was very happy to hear that it arrived as promised, but then I was told that it was just the topping to put on your own fruit.  Nowhere in the description did it say that - the limited information led me to believe that everything was there to make the cobbler. Why have the name "Cherry Jubilee"?  Why have a picture of cherries on the bag?  They should just say fruit topping mix.<br /><br />I went to the Julia's Pantry website where they advertised six different cobbler mixes.  Upon reading the instructions for each of them, I saw that they actually are identical --  put a can of your own {strawberries, blackberries, apples, peaches, cherries, or blueberries} in a dish, sprinkle the cobbler mix on top, add milk and bake.  Of course, none of this information was on the Amazon listing.<br /><br />If you only want the topping, then this might be for you.  But do not buy it if you expect to be able to make a complete cobbler from the box.
