review/summary: So easy even a Dad can make it
review/text: I am a dad that can boil water, and following the directions explicitly and remembering to start the timer when the water starts to boil again allowed me to make something that my pasta loving kids (17 & 20) enjoy. The first time it was a bit salty for our taste, but a very brief spray of water took care of that. I add a half a pad of butter on the pasta after draining to avoid the glumping other reviewers caution against.<br /><br />The lack of a gf pasta alternative had put a crimp in our revised meal planning. No longer. And since it stores well in the 'frigerator, we have even more options.  For example, the pasta stays firm and tasty after sauteing, something I heard other gf pastas fail at,  with green onions and sliced mushrooms. The microwave does not turn it into goo.<br /><br />My same thoughts apply  to their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0YW">bionaturae Organic Penne Rigate, Gluten Free, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Gluten free product review
review/text: This product is a really good sub for real spagetti when you have someone in the house that can't eat gluten or spaghetti made with traditional flour. My husband can eat gluten but pronounced this spaghetti every bit as good as the regular kind. I am happy to find these products online and ordered the package of 6 12 ounce bags. It needs the salt they say to add though so don't leave that out or it is terribly bland.

review/text: Agreed, this is by far one of the BEST gluten free pastas available, as most are mushy, or taste funny, etc... Do be careful not to overcook though.  Only other Pasta that I like as much as this one is Trader Joe's own brown rice pasta.  Really great texture and no strong taste, so I truly can't tell the difference from "regular" pasta.

review/summary: From a pasta snob: the best GF out there
review/text: When my son came down with gluten allergy, I searched for a good pasta brand, and this is it. Almost indistinguishable from the wheat-based type. Not gritty. Holds together well. Cooking time same as wheat pasta, which is important when I have a wheat and a GF pasta pot going side-by -side on the stove.<br />I'm well experienced with Italian cooking and I'm a self avowed pasta snob. This is my go-to brand when I cook GF.

I don't really remember what real spaghetti tastes like but for something gluten free I felt it was pretty good. One of the better brands I've had. I also didn't get sick and I'm very sensitive to gluten so it's very safe. At least the batch I got was. I think it's a good brand and I will definitely buy this again.

review/summary: bionaturae Organic Spaghetti, Gluten Free, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)
review/text: This is the best gluten free pasta out there...my kids and I have tried as many as we can find.  Hint--add a little canola oil (I don't know why the canola works and others haven't, I learned it from a chef a a celiac camp I went to last summer with my son--and it works) to the water while you are boiling and stir stir stir--I use a spaghetti spoon.  Do not walk away...If any of the strands start to stick together, use a fork and gently press against the side of the pot to make them come apart...then continue stirring. It's 8-10 minutes out of your evening, but if you miss spaghetti, it's totally worth it! This is not a pasta you want to assign to someone with ADHD (my husband cannot stand over the pot for the total of 10 minutes of stirring it takes..he grows bored)  lol, my point is that you have to pay attention to it to get it done right, and when you do it right it is just like regular pasta!  I have made it many many times with perfect results...good stuff!

review/summary: Bionature Gluten Free Pastas
review/text: I have never been a fan of regular pastas but my wife would eat pasta everyday and anyway it was fixed.  She was diagnosed with celiac disease about 4 years ago so we needed to find a pasta that she could eat.  After many trial and error processes we tried the Bionature pastas and they are wonderful.  Even I enjoy this pasta, and we eat it at least twice a week.<br />It is more epensive that other gluten free pastas, but it is well worth the extra cost.  I order the spaghetti, macaroni, fusilli, and the penne rigata by the case (6 or 12 pkgs.), and I have found no place cheaper than Amazon, especially with their free shipping.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0YW">bionaturae Organic Penne Rigate, Gluten Free, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4P00">bionaturae Organic Spaghetti, Gluten Free, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTI1L8">bionaturae Organic Fusilli, Gluten Free, 12 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTC17S">bionaturae Organic Elbow Pasta, Gluten Free, 12 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Great tasting pasta
review/text: For my family, the two most difficult foods to replace when we gave up gluten were breads and pasta.  Many pastas we found were unpleasant-they turned from hard to mushy or slimy, dissolved in the cooking water, or smelled so strongly of corn they had to be buried in sauce to mask it.  We are so glad to have found this spaghetti.  Like the other GF pastas we have tried, it is best eaten when first prepared, so I no longer cook large quantities of pasta at a time, just what we'll eat at a sitting.  But we are all enjoying spaghetti again and that is a very good thing. One note for gluten-free households:  Bionaturae also makes regular pastas, so (as always) be sure you have the gluten-free one. This pasta is hard to find where I live, and Amazon's price for the 6-pack is better than the grocery store prices the odd time or two I've found the pasta locally. Enjoy.

review/summary: Excellent Gluten Free Pasta
review/text: This pasta is absolutely delicious.  It is the closest in taste and texture to standard wheat pasta of any of the gluten free pastas I have tried.  It does require some extra care in cooking, so I recommend gently stirring it a couple of times and testing frequently for doneness, as it can get mushy and break apart if it cooks too long (this can happen very quickly as it gets closer to al dente).  This pasta pairs well with all sauces and works nicely in casseroles, too.  If you will be serving this to people not on a gluten free diet, I highly recommend this pasta, as most would not be able to tell the difference; it's just that good.

I can even have it plain with some fresh tomatoes and parmesan and it tastes great.<br /><br />For those who complain about gumminess... three things:<br /><br />1. Cook it throughly<br />2. Stir, stir, stir in the first few minutes of cooking in order to prevent clumping. Making sure the pasta has room to move and breath (aka having a large enough pot) helps too<br />3. Even though it says "no need to rinse" - rinse it throughly anyway

review/text: I had high hopes for this based on other reviews. Unfortunately, I found it gummy. It seemed that the starch from the pasta was very thick in the cooking water. Although the package said not to rinse it, I did, and that helped a bit. To be fair, we have a large family so I cook two bags at a time but I used more water, too. I prefer the quinoa pasta.

Get Mrs Fields sugar cookies, way better than this garbage. A complete waste of money, they taste dry, not unlike I imagine cardboard would taste.

review/text: The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is for the strange can design -- a substantial amount of food sticks to the inside of the can and in the crevice under the top lip, long before the can is empty, and I have to use a baby food spatula to scrape this off.<br /><br />That being said, Cee Cee kitty devours this. It is not grain free -- as it does have Brown Rice in it (listed as the 8th ingredient, so it DOES have plenty of meat and fish protein), but the meat as well as the other ingredients more than make up for this. Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Formula with Chicken, Turkey, Lamb and Ocean Fish  also smells very fresh and not garbagey like some of the supermarket cat foods. And since Cee Cee is battling hyperthryoidism as well as a heart murmur, I want to buy her the best food I can afford. This may be a bit pricey but it is VERY dense, so it goes a long way.

review/summary: Nutritious food, but my kittens won't eat
review/text: I don't want to give a poor review because my kittens won't eat it, but I figure other cats might like the flavor of this food. I love Felidae for the nutritious value and the wholesome ingredients used. That is very important to me, and I will be sticking with Felidae for wet food. My kittens LOVE the salmon and I just introduced them to the chicken and rice formula this week and they seem to be happy with that too. The larger size cans are more economical.

review/summary: More cereal-like than granola-like
review/text: My 2.5yr old loves this and wants it every morning. It's not a typical hard/crunchy/clumpy granola, it's much more cereal-like in nature, not something you could easily eat with your hands.<br />The serving size is generous for a 'granola', 3/4cup vs some that are only 1/4cup servings. We do go through a box pretty quickly though!!<br />We like that this is a wheat free cereal option.

review/text: I had bought this cereal a couple years ago in an organic market, and I have not seen it since then. I fell in love this cereal. It tastes so good. It's so yummy. The only thing that's a downside is the amount of servings in a box. It's not much, but I don't mind. It's totally worth getting the pack of 6 for that price.

review/summary: Organic Hemp Plus Cereal
review/text: This is a delicious cereal that is organic, doesn't have too much sugar, doesn't cut your mouth like some crystalized flakes and is fun to have on the table to give your teenagers something to roll their eyes about!  I figure about 4 good-sized breakfast bowls of cereal in each box, so it runs a little less than a dollar a serving.  Not cheap, and not a lot in each box, but this can be said of most granolas.  It holds me over until lunch.  I'll buy this again.

review/summary: This is not gluten-free and should not be in the gluten-free list of cereals!
review/text: Although Amazon has this cereal (nature's path hemp granola gluten free) in the "gluten-free" specialty section, the manufacturer does not consider it to be gluten-free due to the presence of oats that are non-GF certified. I'm sure the cereal is quite good, but because I assumed that Amazon was careful in assigning items to the gluten-free list, I bought it and now can't eat it. Please be cautious when purchasing "gluten-free" items from Amazon and always check with the manufacturer if in doubt. Amazon, please take note of this and make the correction! Enough already!

Wheat free doesn't mean gluten free, and I checked with the company. If you google whether or not this is gluten free, you will see the same answer, but I called them. Please DO NOT eat this if you cannot eat gluten because oats do have gluten in them unless they say otherwise

review/summary: Hemp Plus Granola
review/text: My husband loves the Hemp Plus Granola from Nature's Path. He usually slices a banana and adds English Walnuts for not only great taste but a food source that stays with him long enough to get through his busy morning. Myself I prefer the Pumpkin Flax Granola, also made by Nature's Path, with or without a banana. When I go to amazon.com for this cereal it comes with 6 boxes in a package and always arrives in excellent condition. The boxes have never been damaged and my postal carrier delivers it to my door. Nature's Path Cereal and amazon.com are sure the way to go for value, good products and the convenience of opening your front door to retrieve your breakfast cereal.

I just wish the Nutrition label on Amazon matched the one on the actual box.

review/text: We just adopted a pup.  She's a Beagle/Russell mix (Jeagle?  Brussell? Jack-a-Bee?) and I've been looking for different treats for her (because I can't seem to stop myself).  We've found she loves Milk Bone treats but we haven't loaded up on them because we heard they have too much fat.  (Not that weight is a problem at her age and energy level.)<br /><br />I also purchased these Chicken Chips and Newman's Own New Zealand Ranch Style Dog treats, and out of the two she definitely prefers the Chicken Chips which are made out of Chicken, Wheat flour and salt.<br /><br />These chips are hard, but not so hard that I can't break them apart with my fingers.<br /><br />They have an amazing 64% protein, 4% fiber, 16% moisture, and low 2% fat.  (If you have an old dog this might be too much protein.  Our Blackberry, who was 18 years old, when she passed on, certainly couldn't have tolerated it... so head's up on that.)<br /><br />The smell nice and I like that there isn't a bunch of yucky chemical ingredients.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/#kidlit blogger

Oh, yeah, I did.<br /><br />For those looking for something other than just a salty chip, or are tired of the same tortillia and salsa combo - this is a great out of the bag alternative.<br /><br />They do leave some oily residue on fingers (just so you know) .<br /><br />I love them.<br /><br />Christine

review/text: I love gum- it is good for after dinner or for just a random piece now & then. When my local supermarket had it "buy 1 get 1", I picked up 4 packs of this gum in various flavors. Now I realize why they were selling it for so cheap.<br /><br />First putting it into my mouth, the gum is nice, soft, & tastes fine. The flavor is a little strong at first, but that's OK- it isn't too strong. Unfortunately after a few minutes that range anywhere from 2 minutes to five minutes, the flavor disappears & the gum becomes incredibly tough & rubbery. The claims of "long lasting flavor" are anything but.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing this gum again & I wish that I hadn't bought the four packs of it. Maybe the other flavors will be better, maybe they won't. All I know is that I won't be buying it again. I'm giving the gum 2 stars because the initial 2-5 minutes weren't bad, but other than that it is a solidly 1 star experience.

review/summary: My favorite sugarfree gum
review/text: I've tried a lot of different brands of sugarfree gum, but this has my favorite taste. Because it is bubblegum, it tends to stay soft longer than most other types of gum. Many sugarfree gums these days use sugar alcohol, and this one does, too, but though others have caused me digestive problems, this one doesn't seem to. It has a mixture of sweeteners: sorbitol (sugar alcohol), mannitol (sugar alcohol), acesulfame K, and sucralose (the generic name for Splenda). There is controversy over artificial sweeteners, and some experts consider them dangerous to the health, so that is something to be aware of when chewing any sugarfree gum.<br /><br />It's also important to note that sometimes people who chew a lot of gum with sugar alcohol develop symptoms that look and feel like IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). Several different dentists have also warned me that it is bad for the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in your jaw to chew gum a lot.

review/text: Great flavors!  Most gum flavors don't last as long as we'd like but Extra last longer than most other gums I've tried.  The flavors just BURST out of the gum into my mouth!  Bubble Gum flavor is my favorite but fruit flavors are great too.  I chew two sticks at a time so I can blow & pop bubbles; that's just me.  Sometimes I only want a quick bit of flavor in my mouth to freshen so a half a stick will do.  It's normal for gum to be harder to chew once the sweetener & flavor are gone.  Don't hold that against this gum for being normal.<br /><br />Extra is the best sugarless gum I've ever tasted!  And I even prefer it over sugar gums!

Leave my stomach full for the whole morning. And these days I'm trying the Australian version--Weet-bix, and I must say the UK version is much more tasty!

review/summary: A Delicate, Sweet Taste
review/text: I first had these delightful candies in Japanese class. The first thing I noticed were the wrappers, which come in three different colors (yellow, blue, and pink) and have beautiful, realistic flowers printed on them. The flower names are also given in Japanese, a bonus if you can read it.<br /><br />The package says (also in Japanese) that these are "milk plum" candies, and indeed, they do have a plummy taste. They're sweet, but they have a delicate taste that's kind of hard to describe. It's almost flowery.<br /><br />These little plum candies are tasty and attractive- perfect for your candy dish!

review/summary: Plain ol' hard candy
review/text: I'm not a huge fan of hard candy, but when I saw how cute the packaging was for these candies, I couldn't resist. The wrappers come in pearly pastel colors with different flowers on them. Even though the wrappers are different, the flavor is the same for each candy. It's somewhere in the realm between plum and peach, and isn't very strong. I didn't really want anymore after I had the first one.

review/text: Since personally I cannot read what this package really says, I was curious to try them. I had received a couple of these at work and was curious if they tasted like flowers or not, so I ordered my own bag, well when I got my bag of candy, I popped one in my mouth, the taste is very good, candy is shaped like a flower, so I'm guessing that is where the flower part comes into play. Flower tasting or not, very satisfied with this candy!

review/summary: This week on Intervention:
review/text: My wife Maki and I recently vacationed in Salt Lake City and found there a small Japanese grocery store.  While perusing, we loaded up on candies and snacks for the long drive back to Montana the following day.  Included in our cache: seven bags of Flowers Kiss candies.<br /><br />"Seven," I said.  "Do we really need this many?"<br />"Yes," she growled.  "And if they had more I'd buy them too.  Hand me your wallet."<br /><br />My wife, recently yoked from Japan and transplanted into the States under the muse of our civil union, had apparently been hiding from me a desire for the Flower's Kiss that rivaled anything she could have ever found in We.  Dumbfounded, I followed her to the cash register line and watched helplessly as she rapidly devolved from the soft spoken girl of my dreams into a rattled and aggressive junkie.<br /><br />She didn't wait to leave the building before violently opening one of the bags and candy flew everywhere.  There was a small eatery in the store full of what could previously be described as aloof Asians that were now ogling us from their chairs.  I looked down and my wife of one wonderful year was on her hands and knees cramming the candies into her mouth, wrappers on.  She was cursing and cackling and when the horrified business owner reached for his phone, I pulled her up off the floor, pushed her out the door, and then stuffed her into our car.  Restrained by the seat belt, she eventually crashed an hour later.  Her slackened, sticky lips moved wordlessly as she slid from consciousness and I could do nothing except punch the steering wheel.<br /><br />What was happening to her?<br /><br />In Japan they call it, "kisu" for kissing but when it shows up in the U.S., and it will, we'll call it an epidemic.  While she was passed out, I took the remaining bags and threw them away save one which I stored under the spare tire in our trunk.  I had the house to myself later that week, (she was still in hospital), and that's when I blasted off.<br /><br />The write up here on Amazon would have you believe that the flavor profile is of the apricot-plum variety but I will not stand behind that description.  They instead and more accurately taste of milky peach and are absolutely delicious.  Roughly the diameter of a quarter and maybe half of an inch thick, they're mostly smooth discs topped with a knobby exterior that creates a sort of grip for your tongue that I found completely necessary.<br /><br />When I took the candy, my glands responded immediately.  The combination of delightfully balanced sweetness with the sudden eruption of saliva orchestrated in my mouth a vibrant sensation of such overwhelming sensitivity that it dumped me on my rear where I wept openly for the first time in years.  How could I have ever condemned her for this?  She was strapped down in a hospital bed sad and misunderstood while I got my kicks from the very substance that put her there.  And I felt rotten about it.<br /><br />"Flower's Kiss candies aren't BAD," I said to the nodding glitter wizard floating next to me.  "These are as far from bad as good has ever been.  My god, man, what have I done and why isn't she here doing this with me?  Maki comes home NOW."<br /><br />I stood to grab my car keys and that's the last thing I remember.  The next morning I woke up in the bath wearing only a memory foam cuirass and a set of besagews made of alarmingly moist cod pieces.  Bare from the waist down, my legs and groin were covered with cigarette burns and the glued on tufts of hair I'd apparently shaved off of a yak that was drinking quietly from a toilet full of what I thought was blood but ended up being melted Otter Pops.  Things couldn't have been worse.  I'd hit bottom.<br /><br />Thus, here I am writing this by blowing into a computer straw because the staff here won't let me use my hands.  And I get that - when the nurses walk in too fast I think they're wendigos and I throw things.<br /><br />But I'm healing now and so is Maki.  When we finally get back on our feet we're going to sue Kasugai for manufacturing what clearly must be the most dangerous candy in the world.<br /><br />And I thank you for listening.<br /><br />- t

review/summary: A wonderful treat
review/text: As a long-time buyer of Asian candies, I love that they always seem to be sweeter and tastier(and sometimes even less fatty/sugary/etc). These candies are not an exception. I was slightly afraid of the 'plum/peach' flavor since I'm not a big fan of either, but it was lovely. I actually don't enjoy the bumpy texture, but it's no big deal- and once they turn smooth it's only bliss. If I could afford it, I'd fill my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008E072Y">Reach In Penny half gallon candy jar</a> with these and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AQWFY2">Kasugai Rich Milk Hard Candies</a>.

review/text: These cookies arrived quickly and are in great shape.  They are very fresh and are all Shortbread.  The brand sent is Murray and looks just like the picture.  Ignore the 'Kebbler' title.  The Shortbread is made with Splenda and has a pleasant vanilla-like aftertaste.  Eight little cookies come in a packet.  Each is 1-1/2" in diameter.  The packet is 130 calories and has 140 mg of sodium. The packet says it's equivalent to one diabetic exchange each of fat and carbohydrate.  I feel that one packet is just the right size for a mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack.  Highly recommend.

I love this stuff- takes almost exactly like Miracle Whip and has a nice, whipped texture too.  Great for heart-healthy, low-fat & vegan diets.  I use this on sandwiches, and in carrot or cole slaw.  It's VERY sweet, so a little goes a long way (I thin it with unsweetened almond milk for use in salads), but I love the flavor- fresh and no chemical after-taste.<br /><br />Added later: as a commenter pointed out, it contains egg whites so is NOT vegan- sorry.

review/summary: Fantastic Hummus needs no refrigeration!!!
review/text: Wow, for a Hummus that is pre-packaged and needs no refrigeration it tastes fantastic, if not better than most Hummus that you can find in the refrigerator section of the supermarket.  I bought a "go picnic" box which contained this and was really surprised at how delicious this hummus is.  It is the perfect portion size and would be great in a kid's (or adult's) lunchbox with a handful of crackers.  You can slip this in your purse or back-pack, it's quite durable the packaging, and eat it when you need something healthy and filling.  By the way, check out the Go Picnic ready-to-eat meals.  I first found them at Cost Plus World Market, but have since found them on Amazon.  Their meal with this same "Wild Garden" Hummus also comes with rice crackers, some chocolate, edamame and a fruit and nut mix, it's fantastic, especially if you don't have the time to put together your own healthy snack or lunch box.  I left mine in the car for months and just ate it and it was still really good.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBP6Q0">GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Hummus + Crackers, 4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Perfect glasses for tequila
review/text: When it comes to a&ntilde;ejo tequilas, it's time to put your shot glasses away and use a vessel that best accentuates the color, flavor, and bouquet of the pricey aged spirit you're about to experience. Like wine, a&ntilde;ejo tequila is aged to give it characteristics you'll want to enjoy. The slight bowl of the Riedel Ouverture helps direct the sweet vanilla and cinnamon notes to your nose, and is perfect for sipping to fully appreciate the unique qualities of the particular, and likely limited, batch of a&ntilde;ejo in which you've invested. Yes, they are fragile. They're made of glass. Treat them with care. I've run mine through my dishwasher several times with no problems, but I'm always cautious not to crowd them and to remove them slowly. These glasses were a tiny investment compared to what a bottle of high quality tequila costs, and I strongly recommend them to anyone out to deepen their tequila experience.
