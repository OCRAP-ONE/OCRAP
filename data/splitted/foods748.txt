review/summary: Oversweet Disappointment.  Not dark at all.  :(  :(  :(
review/text: These sounded divine.  I ADORE dark chocolate, and Dove is one of my favorites.  However, these are soooooooo sweet that tiger almost hurt my mouth.  Vague Raspberry taste and much more of a milk chocolate flavor tgan a dark one.  I recommend if you like extra sweet chocolates or if you like milk chocolates.  If you, like me, like wonderful dark chocolate flavors, this will likely disappoint.

review/text: I love these things, and haven't been able to get them in my local stores anymore.  I was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure and had to cut back on sodium.  One serving (5 pieces--I usually don't eat that many!) only has about 1% of your sodium allowance for the day.  I've had to give up a lot of my favorite treats, so it's great to be able to indulge myself with these.

review/text: My company replaced the Keurig with a Flavia machine. Only good thing about this is that the lines at the machines are empty instead of 2, 3 deep.  Anyhoo---tried the French Vanilla. It's extremely weak and tastes overwhelmingly like coconut for some reason. I like coconut flavored things, but not my coffee.  Tried it twice, weeks apart. Same thing. Not a fluke.

review/summary: Delicious, seriously!! But pricey!!
review/text: I discovered these yummy chips, they are actual pieces of kale with a yummy coating of vegan cheese and brewer's yeast. I think they may have some added nut protein as well. They are truly delicious you can't eat just one or two bites. The vampire killer leafy kale is also great, really my favorite but you will reek of garlic afterwards. These chips are a really great, guilt-free snack but they are overpriced and that is why they shouldn't get 5 stars but for taste they do.

review/summary: Great snack, but pricey
review/text: I was wandering the aisles of my local Wegmans supermarket recently and saw Brad's Raw Leafy Kale--Naked flavor on the shelf. We use fresh kale all the time for our smoothies, but I haven't been able to get myself to eat "raw" kale, like just-picked-from-the-garden-that-we-use-for-our-smoothies kale. So when I saw this "raw" kale snack I thought, they're not really "raw." They are dehydrated (under 115&#730;F) and seasoned, to make them palatable. And they are DELICIOUS. I love them. I am hooked. They have a slight crunch, but not a chip crunch, more like a firm bite. My kids like the initial taste but don't like the aftertaste. I love the whole thing. The problem is that they only come in a 2.5 ounce clear plastic container (supposedly 2.5 servings), which I can easily eat in one sitting. " If you look at the nutrition facts, you'll notice they're not totally healthy. They have 9 g of fat per serving, or 22.5 g of fat per container, which realistically is what I could eat at a time if I were hungry. They are also a bit pricey (I paid $7.50 for the one package). Surprisingly, Amazon's price is higher, so I'll have to buy them directly from Brad's website, or from Wegmans or Whole Foods. If these were cheaper, I'd buy them all the time. But for now they're more like a "treat myself" kind of snack.

review/summary: High calories, low taste
review/text: In order to be a successful chip substitute, kale chips need to have:<br />1) Crunch and/or crispness<br />2) Salty flavor<br />3) Appropriate price for the increase in health<br /><br />Sadly, these "chips" do not meet the standards I've outlined. First, there is so much gunk on them that they aren't even all that crispy. Dried nori is a better solution, which is crispy and crunchy. Secondly, the kale isn't even that salty! Weird, yeasty veggie taste? Check. Salty goodness? No. Well, one can assume then that at LEAST these chips would get the third point right, having the healthy benefits of being kale right? Wrong again! These chips have a surprising amount of calories because, well, of the gunk. Apparently in the gunk is sugar and sunflower seed paste which, not surprisingly, bumps up the calories and sugar content significantly.<br /><br />Are they better than doritos? Yes, but barely and not enough to justify the loss in taste or increase in price. My suggestion is to make your own chips, find another brand that stays more natural, switch to popcorn, or try dried nori as a healthy salty alternative.

review/text: I'm a gal who LOVES her sweets - and I had one of these babies just early today HOLLA!!  Twix hit a grane slam with this addition to the Twix family.  I remember when the two varieties of Twix were the original caramel and the peanut butter - both featuring the same kind of regular cookie base.<br /><br />That was then and this is now!  These aren't your fathers peanut butter Twix.  With the new kind, you'll find a chocolate cookie base, and the difference is truly impressive.  This is uniquely different Twix flavor - and the spookiest chick around recommends them like nobody's business.  Just don't overdo it or you'll be passing gas more than usual.

review/text: Apparently the ORIGINAL Twix Peanut Butter (PB) bar has been discontinued and was replaced with this inferior version (I guess at least a couple of years ago).  Wish I had known that before ordering these bars!  Yet another perfectly GOOD product needlessly messed up by the manufacturer!  This version has a dark chocolate cookie, which I guess is okay; but it does not taste near as good to my tastebuds as the original PB bar with the standard cookie!  I guess I will have to look for something else the next time I get a peanut butter candy/cookie urge that needs satisfying.  Again, for whatever reasons, companies just can never seem to leave well enough alone, go figure?

review/text: I finally tried the Basil Olive and was disappointed. It had a bitter taste.  I bought the 4 piece sampler from Mantova and was very happy.  I used it on cold pasta and veggies, and bread and all four were delicious. Since I especially liked the basil I ordered the larger bottle. I'm not sure why the larger bottle had a bitter taste. I did use half basil and half a extra light olive oil when I served the samplers, so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it or not. I'm going to try that and see if it works.  If it does I'll amend my review. If not then I'm afraid I'll have to stick with this one and won't be ordering it again.

review/text: This product was just what I was looking for.  I had to satisfy a taste for truffles after vacationing in Tuscany and going through withdrawl.  This truffle cream was great and the price was the best I could find.  It makes a fantastic base for bruschetta when topped with crispy fried fresh sage leaves and pecorino romano cheese.<br /><br />If you love truffles, you'll love this product.  If you haven't tried truffles then don't - because you'll become addicted.<br /><br />I must add a comment regarding the service as well.  In the first shipment I received, one of the jars got broken.  I emailed Amazon's customer service and within an hour I had a reply that they were sending out a replacement that same day.  In a world where customer service can sometimes be non-existant it is worth noting when a company stands behind what they sell and responds so efficiently.  Bravo Amazon.

review/text: These candies are okay and definitely appeal to my younger daughter.  The candy has a sour presence and then once you eat the candy, it is sweet.  Nice flavor combination too.  Chewy.  Note:  The initial flavor of the candy has a somewhat odd plasticy(?) taste to it which I attributed to the packaging.  Once you bite into the candy or dissolve the sour crystals on the outside, that taste goes away.  My problem with this product had to do with the delivery.  I ordered a box of 18 individual bags.  The box I received was open (not sealed) and there were only 17 bags of product.  I did not keep the purchase but instead purchased a small bag at my local large retailer and tried them from there.

review/text: I literally could not live without the Monthly Comfort tea. A friend recommended it to me for "the time of the month" and I tried it skeptically - especially as I am not a mother, a soon to be mother, or motherly at all. I start drinking at least a cup of this three to four days before my cycle, and find that most of the monthly annoyance of being a woman subsides. What was a week of unpleasantness, with two days of insomnia because the pain is so bad has no turned into a day or two max of light cramps, with no bloating either.<br /><br />To me it tastes like cinnamon and ginger, with raspberry undertones. It tastes delicious enough that I often have it all month long, not just on my cycle. It's especially pleasant on a chilly morning.<br /><br />I buy this in bulk now, because running out is simply not an option!

I typically have issues with gaining upwards of 10 lbs of water weight during my menstrual cycle - not this time.  Cramping is significantly reduced, water weight is non-existent, even my husband commented on my much improved monthly demeanor.<br /><br />The tea is easy to make, though I would certainly recommend steeping for a solid 15 minutes for best results.  I drink two cups of this tea each day (morning and afternoon) starting a few days before my cycle and all the way through.  I do not normally enjoy tea, but I have to say, this is delicious.  I didn't even need to add sugar or other sweetener to mask the taste.<br /><br />I have used most of the Earth Mama tea products, and have been impressed by the high quality, delicious flavors, and natural remedies for my ails.  I highly recommend giving this product a try.

review/summary: Time consuming, but Yummy!
review/text: When I was in college, some missionaries once introduced me to sticky rice balls served with sweetened condensed milk (or hot sauce). I haven't had it since then, until I saw this kit. I have to make it on a day I plan to be home because the rice has to soak for 4-6 hours before it's steamed. And then the rice has to steam for 45 minutes. But the end product is delicious... Enjoy.

review/summary: Sticky Rice Maker
review/text: I have had a desire for Sticky Rice for many years, ever since my time in South East Asia in the early 60s. Until I came on this product, and the rice from Import Foods, I had almost forgot how it was supposed to taste. This kit brought all the memories back from those days, and the food taste from that region that I really love. I can see no other way to make rice taste like it should.

review/summary: Easy and tasty way to make sticky rice
review/text: My daughter and I love sticky rice.  This kit makes rice that comes out the same texture as the sticky rice we get in restaurants.  There are a lot 'sauce' recipes out there so you can make the rice in this kit and then find a sauce recipe that suits you.<br /><br />I soak the rice overnight or set it in a bowl on the counter when I leave for work.  After the soaking period, it's super simple.  Put it in the basket covered with cheese cloth and let it cook.  That's all there is to it.

review/text: This is delicious and easy to cook. My family asks can we have sticky rice often. I make it about once a week. Everything you need comes with the order. Great price. I prefer to cook the rice without the cheesecloth, though the bamboo basket gets a little dirty when you don't use cheesecloth. I do choose to cook without the cheesecloth and it is not hard to clean basket. I assume the cheesecloth is for easier cleanup. I found a sticky rice dipping sauce recipe online and it is so good.

review/summary: Twice the price but convenient for travel and back-up
review/text: The price on Amazon for these ready to use cans (16 8-ounce cans) fluctuates from 25 to 29 cents per ounce, which is a little more than double what you would pay for the most economical container of powder Enfamil formula (approximately 11 to 13 cents per reconstituted ounce).  Sometimes the convenience is worth the extra money.  Every other evening I mix about 40 ounces of formula at a time for our infant son, but these cans come in handy if I forget to do it or if we are on the road.  These cans are now an essential part of my diaper bag, because when you need formula immediately, waiting for someone to bring you a cup of water can be a challenge!

review/summary: Bottle not compatible with standard nipples.
review/text: We use Enfamil, so no complaints about the formula, but don't buy these if you are planning to travel with them. Bought the eight oz bottles with the intention of using them on a road trip we have to take. Figured these are 8 oz bottles, ready to use for older infants, just like the 2oz nursette bottles, right? Nope. That would make sense. So, the ready to use BOTTLE is just saving me the oh-so-tedious task of mixing the formula. Still need a bottle to pour it in, since the opening is clearly not designed for a standard disposable nipple. You'll have bring along your own bottles (and wash them in your hotel room sink) or buy disposable bottles. Nice work Mead Johnson.

I haven't needed to use all the cans yet, but its good to know I have an emergency plan.<br /><br />No mixing powder w/water or measuring.  Just shake can, open, and use.<br /><br />My son eats Oatmeal which I mix with breast milk.  When I was sick there wasn't enough breast milk to store, bottle feed him, and put in his Oatmeal cereal which he loves to eat.  So I used half a can to mix in his cereal.<br /><br />The price was cheaper on Amazon compared to Costco and Walmart.

review/text: I used Enfamil RTF with my first son and I now use it with my second son.  It's a great product and a great value.  The 8 oz. size is perfect for traveling or just on the go.  It's more convenient than toting around a 32 oz. can.  My son seems to really enjoy it.  I tried the Newborn formula, but since it only comes in 2 oz. RTF and powder, I opted to switch to Infant which is available in more convenient RTF sizes and my little one had little to no problems when we made the switch...maybe a little gas the first couple of days, but can't be sure it was from the formula.

review/text: Disappointed that I could no longer find Twinings Blackcurrant tea on the supermarket shelves, I was glad to find that I could order it on line. It is the only Twinings black flavored tea that I like--not too fruity, but with just a touch of berry flavor that adds to, rather than detracts from, the basic black tea. It leaves no bitter taste and the aroma is inviting.  Wish the markets would start carrying it again.

review/summary: Artificially flavored, unfortunately
review/text: I'm a big fan of Peet's Black Currant Black Tea, which only comes in tea leaves in a tin. I use it at home all the time and I love it, but at home I can make it in a teapot and I have a personal-sized one that makes two mugs.  So I wanted black currant flavored black tea in teabag form for use at the office, where I just make one mug at a time.  (The teapot shtick is too much trouble at work and takes up too much time.)  So I found this black currant tea and figured it would be good -- it's Twining's after all -- and I went for six boxes of 20 teabags each.  Now I realize -- I probably should have paid closer attention to the illustration of the box -- that it's artificially flavored.  These teabags smell artificial compared to Peet's, and the black currant aroma of these teabags is faint compared to what I experience when I open a tin of Peet's.  When I brew a mug of tea, it has adequate flavor, but the black currant flavor is overshadowed by the artificial boysenberry-like flavoring they've added and that detracts.  I don't want my black currant flavored black tea to smell and taste of artificial boysenberry  I expect better from Twining's.  I'll stick with Peet's and I'll simply drink it at home and have another kind of tea at work.

review/summary: Delicious, affordable black tea
review/text: This and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UEKF5S">Twinings Pomegranate Delight, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> are my favorite easy-to-find, flavored black teas.  I originally got hooked on Twinings when I found a box of the Pomegranate Delight at Walmart a couple of years ago.  Since then it is really difficult to find that flavor so I usually get the blackcurrant one.  Both are really good!<br /><br />I solely use them to make iced tea and use 2 bags of one variety of flavored black tea in one container and 2 bags of one variety of flavored green tea in another container.  The best green teas for mixing & icing that I've found are the Lipton variety such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F2O70W">Lipton Green Tea, Mixed Berry, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IJT8VG">Lipton Green, Superfruit, Black Currant and Vanilla, 20-Count  Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>. They are affordable and have less bite/tartness and floater powdery stuff that sinks to the bottom than other brands.<br /><br />Let the containers cool and put it in a 32 oz to-go cup in the refrigerator and my work day is set for success!  Some teas I feel like get gross or funky after a day or two sitting in the fridge.  This one is still delicious the next day or two if I don't drink it all the first day.  Subscribe and save makes them cheaper than constantly hunting down sales at the grocery store.  And I have a six month supply!  Win-win, thanks Amazon.

review/text: A strongly flavored black tea. The blackcurrant flavor is strong enough to overpower the tea - do not over-steep this. 3 minutes is usually good; anything past 5 is going to be very strong. I take mine with milk, but it's certainly fine without it.<br /><br />I started having a hard time finding this tea several years back, when Whole Foods pulled it from its shelves. It turns out the blackcurrant flavor is partly artificial, so it doesn't meet Whole Foods standards. Since then, I looked all over Austin, Texas for another supplier. Never found one, but getting it 6 boxes at a time works pretty well.

Every single time they take the first drink they do this squinty-faced happy dance while giggling. In all seriousness, every time. I might be forced to admit to an occasional grin of satisfaction myself when I drink this concoction.<br /><br />It also makes an incredible iced tea...hopefully that doesn't get any English knickers in a bunch.

We've tried several varieties and all of them have been a hit. It's a little too pricey for us to use as a complete substitute (we use almond milk), but I often pick it up as a treat or for when they feel icky.

review/summary: Truly Wonderful.
review/text: I saw the company was offering a "buy-one-get-one-free" coupon offer on their website and although I did not partake on it, the offerings interested me greatly. Two Whole Foods and a gourmet deli search later, I found a local place that finally had it in stock. They did not have the flavor I wanted but I chose this instead.<br /><br />I don't like the taste of flavored waters most of the time but I was in need of a beverage after a long work day and I was glad to have found it. Upon opening a bottle, I suggest smelling it! The aroma is a precursor of the natural thrill to come. I am not a fan of anything minty, but when I began to drink it I was taken aback by how smooth and refreshing it really is. The tastes are of a medium distinction so if anyone is concerned about the strength I suggest you shouldn't worry.<br /><br />The best part was the clearing of my nostrils afterwards! I couldn't believe that part. I look forward to trying the others (if I can find more places near me). I give this a "yea"!

review/summary: Delicious, refreshing water!
review/text: I love the Metromint water in the two mint flavors. They are refreshing and give your mouth a clean, freshly brushed feeling. I don't usually drink bottled water for environmental reasons, but this is one product I treat myself to every now and then. It's especially wonderful after a long, hot sweat session at the gym.<br /><br />My only issue (and this is not directly related to the product) is that I wish Amazon.com offered these cases of water in a Subscribe & Save option. I order 1-2 cases per month and would love the option of an automated regular monthly delivery.

review/summary: Spearmint: Sooo refreshing!
review/text: I really though that this was gonna taste kinda funky..  I mean, I hate flavored water in general.  This spearmint Metromint water was a GREAT surprise!  Drinking it cold was so amazingly refreshing; it also helped relieve mid-day hunger because of its flavoring.  I think it would be a great weight-loss supplement.<br /><br />I haven't tried any of the other flavors -- I thought chocolate was a little too crazy -- but now I'm definitely going to.  Thanks @ Dallas, too, for the info on the chocolate water.  Can't wait to give it a shot.

review/text: I found this in a airport and although it was priced at 2.99 which I thought was expensive, I decided to go ahead and try it.  It has a very mild taste of spearmint that goes away quickly but leaves you feeling as if you have good breath.  However, spearmint is not something I enjoy tasting outside of gum so I am going to try the chocolate flavor.

I just hope Amazon lowers the price as well as making this one of their Subscribe & Save products.  I just ordered 4 of the 12 packs - (1) Lemon, (1) Chocolate, and (2) Spearmint.  I'll be so happy if they lower this to around $1.00 or less per bottle.  I would then order this stuff like crazy as I hate drinking regular water and am seriously trying to get off diet sodas.<br /><br />P.S. - If you're wondering about the Chocolate flavor - it's awesome.  It sounds nasty but is actually good.  It taste a bit like your drinking water with one of those green Andes candies in your mouth.

I am not a big fan of the spearmint and the chocolate but that is a personal taste issue.<br /><br />I was going to order more and saw it was out of stock!  I am so disappointed as it is hard to find in the stores.

review/summary: Great taste and no calories - without all the Chemicals!
review/text: The Metromint products are all awesome. Perfect for someone trying to eliminate chemicals from their life but wants something a little more interesting to drink than straight water. I love reading the ingredient list - usually only two ingredients (max of 3).<br /><br />The way I enjoy Metromint: I get a wine glass, fill it with Ice, and then poor in the Metromint. Really excellent that way! I like all the flavors though the Orange Mint, Peppermint, and Chocolate Mint are my favorites. The aroma of the Chocolate Mint reminds me of a York Peppermint Patty when I drink it. Again, really excellent over ice. Using subscribe and save is less than it costs at my grocery store and conveniently arrives on my doorstep without shipping costs. Much better than buying from the manufacturer and saves me lugging product home from the store. I highly recommended product and it is a good value when using Subscribe and Save.

review/summary: The Classic Mint Water
review/text: I love metromint products. I've never really liked drinking water, but metromint is so much more refreshing than regular water and doesn't add any calories or chemicals to my diet. The peppermint is by far the "mintiest" flavor they make. It tastes kind of like drinking water while chewing a strong peppermint gum. I keep it at my desk at work because it doesn't need to be refrigerated and still feels cool because of the mint. This is a wonderful product for mint lovers, but if you don't like a strong mint flavor, the fruity metromints are not quite as strong.

THAT said, while I try to steer clear of bottled waters, esp *trendy, designer waters* as a rule, or too much in the way of pre-packaged anything, I have to say I really enjoy Metromint and will continue to purchase as long as it's available, esp. with Amazon's free shipping offer. Ordered two cases here recently; same price as in store, with the bonus of saving gas $ for the two hour round trip drive had I purchased it up North. (haven't seen it locally.) Very refreshing, wonderfully clean, calorie-free natural chocolate-minty "essence" in a bottle. I was skeptical until I opened my first one; *new* loyal customer! Perfect for quashing that sweet craving or quenching your *more discerning* thirst.

In terms of a flavor, spearmint isn't my first choice in gum, yet I find it tolerable.  The spearmint flavor here was faint and vague to the point that it annoyed my taste buds because it was just mild enough to feel like I'm awkwardly drinking a squirt of toothpaste stirred into 16 ounces of water.

review/text: Ok so I don't really like this product- which may be a me problem, and not a problem of the product itself.<br /><br />I love Metromint in Orange Mint, Spearment, Chocolatemint.  Peppermint isn't bad, but a little intense.  I do not like this flavor, it's too weird, minty with a slight cough syrup tang to it.  If you like cherry flavored cough syrups and mint, then maybe it works for you.<br /><br />If not, don't give up on Metromint, just go get one of the other ones.<br /><br />I wasn't a huge fan of the Lemon one either, and there is another berry one that others have reported tastes like minty fruit gum.  I'd skip those.<br /><br />This is a great product for diabetics.  My sister came down with gestational diabetes, and I bought her the chocolate mint.  She loved it, and it had no affect on blood sugar.

review/summary: Peppermint-licious
review/text: Looking for a plain water substitute, I discovered the natural peppermint taste of Metromint to be my new beverage of choice. The refreshing, invigorating taste really lifts your mood, at work, exercise class and every other minute of the day. The peppermint essence is delightfully well balanced, without being overpowering. I really can't stop drinking the peppermint Metromint water and now carry a bottle with me wherever I go.<br /> Drinking more water is part of my personal self improvement program. I was having a difficult time drinking enough Plain Jane water, so I tried the natural uplifting Metromint flavors. Several of the flavors are good, but the Peppermint is the most refreshing. The only drawback is the ability to buy the product locally, for a reasonable price. If I could buy the product by the case, I would.

review/summary: Just the right flavors!
review/text: I got the variety pack of waters, and really like them!  Very refreshing flavors,<br />especially the Spearmint...my 3 year old calls the Peppermint water "candy water".<br />The Lemon mint is my least favorite, but I added some stevia to it and that helped<br />with the flavor.  The flavors are just right, not too strong, not weak.  These are<br />not sweet, if you want sweet you have to add it yourself.<br />I want to try other flavors now as well...especially the chocolate!
