review/summary: The worst coffee ever
review/text: I ordered this coffee based upon Emeril's reputation in the food industry and the fact that it's called "Jazzed Up".  I generally buy Starbucks or other premium coffees but Starbucks isn't out in a k-cup yet.  I am still in shock about how bad this Emeril decaf is.  I can't even say it's like poor quality grocery store level - it's seriously revolting.  I tried another one just to make sure I didn't get a 'bad' k-cup, but it was just as horrible.  So now I have 48 of these putrid things left.  Wonder if Amazon will take them back?!

review/text: This is certainly the best decaf K cup I have tried yet.  I use it with the 4oz setting on my Keurig platinum  machine.  It is still a little too weak, but is head and shoulders above all the other decaf's I've tried.  I've heard that Coffee People Decaf French Roast is superior, but I've had a hard time finding it in stock anywhere.  So until I do find it, Emeril's Jazzed Up will be my decaf of choice.  I'm about to put in my second order. I'm also thinking that a different K cup machine (eg Cuisinart) might result in a better extraction thereby making a stronger brew???  Any thoughts?  Thanks.

review/text: As a fan of the regular Big Easy Bold coffee cups, I did not hesitate to order the decaf, expecting the same depth and richness.  I was disappointed however when I brewed the first cup to find that it tasted much like Dunkin Donuts. The next time I brewed it using the 6oz water selection, and it was better, though still not as I had expected.  Next time I order I will go back to Green Mountain French Roast decaf, which I still have to brew at 6oz, but has the richness I expect.  46 pods to go..............

Not too hot, not too bland.<br />This type of pepper has NO substitution.  Seriously, I've tried.  So,<br />in traditional Korean dishes, it's a must.  It adds great color without<br />making the dish too spicy to eat.  It also has an almost undescribable flavor-<br />only found with this type of pepper. Maybe smoky or earthy - probably both? Not sure,<br />but it is a must have.  It will store for a very long time - as with any spice, don't<br />store/expose it to light and high heat for extended periods of time.  Can be used<br />in Thai, Indian and Moroccan foods as well. Great on fish.  Probably in Mexican food too -<br />if you want the color and not the 3rd degree burn.

review/text: By far, these are the best anchovies ever. Great on homemade pizza, in salads (egg-less Caesar), on crackers, in spaghetti sauce (a la Putana with some capers). These anchovies are worthy of your best dishes. Have fun cooking and eating! Buon Gusto!<br /><br />The containers are very good. Use what you want & save the rest in fridge.<br /><br />Have given an occasional jar to a special guest & fine cook-they are uniformly appreciated and enjoyed.<br /><br />Update 8.10:  Just ordered again. It's sad when we use the last one as these are better than all others! 6-7 time repeat buyer. No point getting those oily anchovies in tins that cut your fingers. If you don't use  all the anchovies, the tins are left to mess up your fridge with oil. Jars can be kept on the door of the fridge. These are great.

review/summary: Look at the shape of the jar
review/text: The anchovies are packed in tightly.  The jar seemed like an improvement over the standard tin - less messy, easily stored leftovers - but the mouth is too small for easy access.  In order to remove them from the jar, you have to tear a number of them apart.  This isn't that difficult because they are mushy to begin with.  They taste fine, but by the time you get then on your pizza, they have become short strips or anchovy dots.

review/summary: Comes with a bonus set of spice jars!
review/text: I use anchovies in lots of things... salads, pasta sauce and of course pizza... and it raises my comfort level to know I've always got a supply of anchovies in the pantry. These are good quality though not dramatically better than the cans I've picked up at random in the store. The oil is neutral rather than having that harsh taste you sometimes get with cheap oil, and the anchovies have just the right amount of saltiness.<br /><br />The jar gives you one big advantage and another equally big disadvantage. The advantage is that you can take what you want and not feel compelled to use the whole jar, or conversely not feel bad about opening a new package when you just need one or two anchovies. The disadvantage is that it's really difficult to get the pieces out of the jar in whole fillets that look nice on pizza. You CAN do it but you should plan ahead and do this before you cook: go at the jar with a skewer or maybe a toothpick, gently raise the pieces out and be prepared for a few failures.<br /><br />Then, after you've used the jar, don't throw it away or recycle it. Give it a good wash, remove the labels with paint thinner and a sharp knife, wash it again and you've got a useful little jar for spices, hardware parts or maybe buttons. By the time you get to the end of your case you've got 18 of them... a whole spice rack!

review/summary: Dead on delivery!
review/text: This was a bad experience and I"m not happy at all about it. It seems like this happens a lot with this product after reading through the comments. When I found my package on the porch today it looked like UPS had dragged it behind the truck all the way here.<br />It was not in a rectangular shape any longer. After opening it I saw that the good people at Amazon had wrapped the whole case of jars with bubble wrap. I felt much better when I saw this. I even had trouble getting the wrap off the case of jars, but when I did,the first thing I smelled was Anchovies. Not good! Then I saw that a quarter of the top of the case was wet with olive oil. Even worse! Then I saw that the tape that Crown Prince had sealed the case up with had been cut open. I don't think it would have made it out their door this way personally. Now I love Amazon and spend so much money with them I should be part owner by now, but I will have to say this was done at their warehouse and someone saw the oil on the case and cut it with a knife to look inside the case and just shipped it anyway. I have four jars that are covered in oil and no way of knowing really which ones are leaking. I suspect that it must be one or all of those four. Now while I have not looked close enough at the four yet to see if there is a fine crack in the bottles or the lids are loose, I have read in others comments where their jars were broken. I have them sitting on a piece of printer paper to see which ones leak. Now I don't know how many of you have ever eaten bad seafood before, but I have and don't ever want to do it again!  So now I have eighteen jars of anchovies at a rather high price to begin with, and really don't know if any of them are safe to eat. My point here is to let you know if your going to order any food from Amazon, don't order anything in a glass jar. I wouldn't want to read about you in the obits. And Amazon, if your going to sell food, do it safely, because if I die eating any of these anchovies, your going be out a lot of bucks when I can't one click anymore!

review/summary: Dimitri's makes Absolutely the BEST Bloody Mary bar none!!
review/text: I can unequivocally say that a Bloody Mary made using Dimitri's Bloody Mary Seasoning--either the Classic Recipe or the Classic plus horseradish--will be the best Bloody Mary you will ever taste bar none! My husband and I both feel that we have never experienced such great Bloody Marys in any restaurant or bar in our entire lives and we're in our sixties!  If you've ever tried to make one yourself and been consistently disappointed because it turned out too hot, too bland, too spicy or not spicy enough, you will know what I mean. With Dimitri's it makes a CONSISTENT TASTY Bloody Mary EVERY TIME and it doesn't matter whether you are using plain tomato juice or V-8 juice. Buyers should note--this is not a Bloody Mary Mix like Mr & Mrs. T's.  Dimitri's is a Bloody Mary Seasoning mix in liquid form that you ADD to the tomato juice=creating an instant, tangy, completely ready to go Bloody Mary. And once you have tasted it you will never go back to mixing them from scratch and you will toss all your Mr. & Mrs. T's out the door!  You won't find Dimitri's in most grocery or liquor stores, so buying it here is a great find!  And it's cheaper at Amazon than it is on Dimitri's own website. So, if you want a superlative Bloody Mary that both you and your friends will rave about when you invite them over, make it with Dimitri's! You will become an instant fan for life! And don't forget to add a hot dilly bean, celery stick or marinated asparagus stalk to the drink! It's great!

review/text: I saw this Demitri's Bloody Mary seasoning in a magazine in my doctor's office.  I went online and found the website and decided to try Amazon first to see if I could get it through them.  We got the package of 3 bottles.  Tried it the first night we got it. It is by far the best bloody mary seasoning we have tried. It has the perfect blend of seasoning and spice! We recommend it to anyone who loves a good bloody mary! It is excellent!

review/text: My wife used to tend bar at a high-end restaurant that used this product in their bar  so that the Bloodys were consistant from bar-tender to bar-tender. We loved it so much that we ordered it for home use. Not only does it make the BEST bloodys, but it is very quick. You just put a squirt of this with your Vodka and Tomato Juice and you are ready to shake! It has all of the good stuff you would normally put in your drink in one bottle, eliminating all of the opening and closing of all those separate ingredients.  Oh, and this stuff was shipped ROCKET fast.

Good vodka and Dimitri's is all that's needed to make a "Classic Bloody Mary".  The "Extra Horseradish" flavor will really spice up the experience.  Dimitri's is also an excellent marinade for steaks and other meats.

review/text: We are bloody mary "professionals".  We love the production of making our own - hauling 7 different little bottles and shakers to parties, tailgating, etc.  But I bought this from Amazon to try out and ... well we love it.  It's ALMOST as good as our standard recipe but without the hassle of hauling stuff around.  We are taking this with us to Mexico so we can have our mary's on the beach each morning.  We find that the best formula is Demitri's mixed with low salt V8 and Clamato - about 70% V8 & 30% Clamato is how I like them. Enjoy!  P.S. We had no issues with the bottles being damaged - although they are a rather flimsy plastic.

If you like it spicy but not too hot then go with the extra horseradish mix. Or you can add extra tabasco or use the V8 Extra Spicy juice to go with the orignal Demitri to get more heat.

review/summary: Add some horseradish....
review/text: Discovered this when I had a fantastic Bloody Mary at Rao's in Las Vegas.  I asked the bartender about it, and he showed me the bottle of Demitri's.  I asked him if they add something to it, because I wouldn't think a mix by itself could be this good.  He said Nope, this is all we use.  I had been making Barefoot Contessa's Bloody Mary recipe, which is considerably more work than adding a shot of this to your tomato juice and vodka, but I prefer this.  I add about half a teaspoon of prepared horseradish to the glass, as I like mine on the spicier side.<br /><br />Try it with a piece of fried bacon instead of a celery stick for garnish.  Mmmm!<br /><br />Hope Amazon gets it back and puts it on Subscribe & Save!

review/summary: If You're Too Lazy To Make Your Own...
review/text: Look, Demitri's a Seattle homie and I support anything our locals do in business but I think the hyperbole about this stuff is a little silly. Is it a bad Bloody mix? Absolutely not. It's flavorful and consistent. But I have never gotten why so many people seem to be so hell-bent on tarting up what is a very simple recipe. Demitri's, like every other commercially-made recipe, tucks in a whole laundry list of extraneous flavors - baking spices, onions, jalapenos, etc., etc., etc. - that actually detract, IMHO, from the pungent, meaty quality of a great Bloody. I've had this one and nearly every other mix out there and never had one that was anywhere near as good as we find here in Seattle at Temple Billiards. Finally, it hit me one day that I've been a chef my whole adult life and there was nothing stopping me from making my own. There's nothing stopping YOU either. It's fun and interesting and you can get EXACTLY what you like. I'm not saying don't buy Demitri's. If you're not creative (or just really lazy), it's fine alternative. But A) I don't like BROWN Bloody Mary's (that should be called a Dried-Bloody Mary) and B) it's just better because it's fresher. Duh. If you enjoy Demitri's, good on ya. But don't lose sight of the fact that you can make better (or just as good) right at home, for a lot less $$$.

review/summary: Perfection in tea brewing
review/text: I had bought one of these a few years ago after using it in a few different restaurants and cafes.  I promptly returned it because of my fear of BPA leaching out of the plastic while using hot water to make tea.  I was happy to see last year that their current product is now safe and non-toxic, so I purchased one of the new improved versions.  It truly is a great invention, the filter is very fine thus you will never have any particles in your tea.  There is no messy pouring, once the tea is steeped, you simply place the BrewT on top of a cup or mug and the liquid is released.  It is just the right size, and is very easy to clean and disassemble.  I have no complaints with this product, and as a plus it is very affordable!

review/text: I purchased the BrewT to give as a present but have been disappointed because it has not held up. Under the heat of the water and tea, the inside of the BrewT has pitted and turned into a messy, unappealing container that looks dirty. Apparently, (and I am guessing) the material from which it is made is not able to handle teas with oils (such as cinnamon tea) that cause pits in the BrewT's interior.<br />It does brew tea well and in a novel way except it always looks dirty.

review/text: For some reason this sea salt taste different than any sea salt I have ever tasted.  In am not a sea salt conasuer but I knew this salt was "the one" after my first taste.  I don't know if sea salt taste differently from region to region or what but I highly recommend this specific brand for its taste. As a side note about sea salt, I have suffered migrains all of my life and after getting rid of table salt and switching to sea salt 40 years of migrains vanished.  I must have needed some type of mineral that is in natural sea salt, I am guessing. Table salt is stripped of all minerals and has additives for its preservation while shipping which is something our bodies don't need anyway!

review/summary: Depends on the Dog
review/text: I have several dogs and got one of these in medium to see how it went over with my pups. Most of my dogs nibbled on it for awhile and moved on, but one of my beagles LOVED it and carries it around with him, keeping it away from the other dogs and chews on it for long periods. Most of my dogs are all about instant gratification and want their chewing to produce something that they can actually eat without a long wait for it, so they tired of this when it didn't 'produce'. If your dog likes to chew for the sake of chewing though, like my Mr. Good Boy, then this will be a hit. It's sturdy, very long lasting and the medium was the perfect size for my beagles, beagle mixes and pit bull that range in size from 17 pounds to 60.

review/summary: She loves it and long lasting
review/text: Our dog Ella loves chewing, and being a young beagle, she still chews through most chews very quickly, with some lasting only a day, and others, like rib bones that stink, are greasy, and tend to splinter and leave behind little splinter bits to step on (ouch!) and are just gross in general. We've tried these antlers before with great success, and they generally last about a month. Although they are more expensive than some, compared to other chews that only last a short time, the expense make up for it. The benefits are hard to beat. The calcium is easily digested, no splintering, which is dangerous for her intestinal tract (and our feet). These are ecologically sound and completely natural, coming from antlers shed from the deer or elk. Other animals in the wild are known to chew on them, too.

Also, it's not messy, greasy, or smelly, and I like the fact that these were made from elk antlers that were naturally shed (so no animals were harmed!). I do wish my dog would like it more because then it'd be the perfect chew toy.

review/summary: Short-lived chew for heavy chewer
review/text: I purchased two of these - one for each of my 50 lb mutts. The older one (4 years old) chewed hers completely GONE within 45 minutes.  The other dog (1 year old) chewed it for a while, and then left it to play with something else.  I don't know how long it would have lasted with him, because my other dog found it and finished that one off too.  While the dogs really liked them, I was disappointed at how much they were considering how short of a time they lasted.  My dogs are heavy chewers though, so that certainly played a factor.  My next purchase will be for something harder.

review/summary: Great Price and Quality
review/text: I noticed some reviews with people complaining about the price. $8 for an elk antler this large, non-bleached, is a fantastic deal. You won't find that price at Pet Supplies Plus, where I usually buy my (deer) antlers at $6 for a teeny tiny one.<br /><br />I also saw some people saying their dog - used to getting deer antler instead of elk - wasn't interested in this one. I was worried about that, but my Chihuahua/Toy Fox Terrier mix could not be happier right now and has fallen asleep cuddling this monster of an antler after a solid hour of chewing! He's still a puppy, so his energy level is outrageous along with his chewing habits, but this thing is so big it's going to last a long time.<br /><br />Of course, with a natural product like this, shape will vary. I uploaded images of my dog enjoying the product to give everyone an idea of what they may get.<br /><br />ETA: Fast delivery - arrived the next day instead of two days.

review/summary: Great for puppies and small dogs!
review/text: I bought this product because my sister had a mixed breed puppy that was chewing on anything and everything.  Nothing she did worked to break the puppy from destroying whatever was available, even if it was the corners on the baseboards.  I decided to buy the product to see if it would help after I read the many positive reviews.  The fact that it was priced far lower than a lot of other brands was also a deciding factor for me.  My sister says it's been amazing.  The puppy now rarely chews on anything but the antler.  Since I ordered two of the antlers, even her 5 year old toy poodle likes to chew on one of them.<br /><br />I'm so grateful that I ordered these as it's made my sister's life so much easier.  Thank you!  I'll be ordering more in the future, if these ever wear out :)

review/summary: Good, long-lasting chew
review/text: My puppy really loves these antler chews.  It took six months to chew through her first one, but she never lost interest. And I like that it doesn't have a smell (like the bully sticks).  She doesn't chew on it for longer than about 10-15 minutes at a time, but she gnaws on it so fiercely that it completely tires her out.  The medium is a good size for her - the first one was about 5 inches long and from 1/2 inch to 1 inch in diameter; the second one was the same length, but thicker (about 1-1/2").  Note that there is only one antler per order, but it's a great bargain as long as they last!

review/summary: 6 month old puppy did not really go for this
review/text: I have a 6 month old Pomeranian puppy who loves chewing.  I introduced this product to him, along with a compressed rawhide stick, and a Himalayan Dog Chew (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J9ST90">Himalayan Dogs Chew 3 to 5-Pieces for Dogs Up to 20-pound, 3-1/2-Ounce</a>) at the same time.  He JUMPED on the compressed rawhide and did not stop until he'd eaten it all about a week later.  He looooooved this thing - it must have tasted super good!  He then tried the antler for maybe a day... it had an interesting smell coming from the part that was cut, and so he chewed on this for a little bit and got some of the hard interior out, but that was it.  He's LOVING the Himalayan Dog Chew though and now carries it everywhere... it's VERY hard but can be bitten through and eaten if he works at it long enough, and he seems to like the flavor of it.  He's totally forgotten about the antler.  It's just sitting on the floor now.  It's just too hard for him.<br /><br />I tried at least - I want him to have more natural treats and chew toys!  Like another reviewer said earlier, it definitely depends on your dog and you won't know until you've bought the product and tried it out.

review/text: I ordered these elk bones for my dogs thinking there would be 3 bones in the order. When I received it there was only 1 bone in the package. In the picture there are 3 bones shown and being priced around $8 I thought that was reasonable for 3 bones. However, paying $8 for 1 dog bone is overpriced in my opinion. I called the company and they refunded me 10% but honestly I would have rather had the 3 bones that I thought I ordered instead of a refund. Even on the packing slip it said "elk antlers" plural. They should change the picture and wording so it is clear you are only ordering 1 bone.

review/summary: Fabulous Flavor -- A real bagain!
review/text: This is the most flavorful sea salt we have ever used. The salt will arrive slightly damp in the jar --at least the first four bottles we have opened have been damp -- but once again, no problem. Dump the jar of salt in a pie pan, and put it in the oven as the oven cools after use. Then the salt grinds in any table salt grinder with ease. It is very grey -- I suspect the source of the great flavor! It also makes great kosher dill pickles -- simply disolve the salt and let it sit for a day in a quart sealer, then pour off the clear saline solution. Fabulous taste -- no cloudy pickles!<br />This salt represents exceptional value. We use this salt for just about everything now.

review/text: I'd ordered this taffy once before and I'd loved it: candy with a tangy molasses flavor seems to be increasingly harder to find, and this was especially good. Therefore I was terribly disappointed when the next shipment tasted only very faintly of molasses, as if they'd drastically reduced the amount of that ingredient.  If you like your molasses taffy bland and almost tasteless, this version may appeal. But it leaves me with the dilemma of not knowing how a batch will taste before i order it.

Buying it on amazon let me buy more of it at less cost.<br /><br />I love this tea - it's very subtle - delicate earl grey flavors with a hint (HINT) of lavender. the other lavender earl grey's i've tried have been much too heavy on the lavender side. This one has a nice blend of both. It needs just a hint of sweetener or sugar/honey and it's perfect. It's good with milk or without. It is a black tea so has caffeine, but it's still relaxing - perfect for a stressful day at work where you don't want to be tired but want something mentally soothing.

I LOVE this tea, it is much stronger and full bodied than "normal tea" and mixing the Earl Grey with lavender gives it a great taste. Most people would probably want to add sugar but as I have stopped drinking coffee, this is the right amount of slightly bitterness that works for me.  Much better than regular Earl Grey tea.  Have not tried the other flavors as I don't like fruity teas.  This stuff is great.

I love tea and have tried dozens of flavors and varieties, but I have yet to find any that sate my senses as well as Revolution's Lavender Earl Grey does. Tea is a sensual experience, for those who take the time to enjoy it. That being said, Revolution's Lavender Earl Grey blend has a way of appealing to all of my senses to make for the most delightful cup of tea I've ever had. I still maintain a passionate and adventurous tea enthusiast, but I always come back to this one. I also highly recommend Fujian Jasmine Tea for an equally enjoyable experience.
