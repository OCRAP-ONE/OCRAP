review/summary: Don't even bother
review/text: The box I received was filled with teas, hot chocolates, and none of the "Holiday" flavors advertised.  Not even worth my time to return it.. totally disappointed!  And it took almost 2 weeks to arrive too.  My box contained mainly the Grove Square instant cappuccino/hot chocolate style k cups.  No Gingerbread, Pumpkin Spice or Spicy Eggnog.  The only "Limited Edition" flavors I received was Green Mountain Island Coconut. Don't waste your money on this one, not even close to what is advertised!

review/summary: healthy and wholesome, but not the tastiest
review/text: This brand features a variety of protein sources for its first six ingredients, which is great.  It also has a pull top, which makes it a bit easier to work with than having to use a can opener.  My cat likes it enough, but she doesn't love it.  I'm quite sure that if I didn't switch between a few brands, she'd get sick of this.  As a comparison that may or may not be helpful for those feeding cats with similar tastes, she really likes the Wellness brand, dislikes Evo, and really dislikes Innova.

review/text: I switched to Felidae canned cat food to help control the weight of my cats; my vet says some cats don't metabolize the carbs of dry food well. I started with Science Diet, but that quickly broke the bank. After 4 months, I'm happy to report my cats have lost weight eating this cat food. My dog gets Canidae (same brand as Felidae) All Life Stages dry kibble which I also recommend.

review/summary: Made in the USA!
review/text: I  fed this food during the hottest days of summer, as it has a lot of moisture to it. I prefer to feed dry food, but every other or every third day I have been feeding Felidae. During the hottest weeks one can was all I needed for four cats. A fourth of a can filled them up at once, though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion. I feed under, and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days.<br />Then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom, and another in the kitchen.<br />I feel very confident with Felidae because of it being made in the United States.<br />I have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food. Big mistake, they won't eat it. They won't eat it with anything mixed in it, i.e. pieces of cooked chicken.<br />Straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors I have been buying.

review/summary: Fits my needs
review/text: I've been using this food for at least six months now.  I feed quite a few cats , so I was hunting for 13oz cans of a decent quality food at a reasonable price--this is quite a challenge!  The cats are all happy with it, I've heard no palatability complaints, and they're all in great health.  They get this in addition to Taste of the Wild dry food.  I'm really happy with this product for my needs, but I'll admit, if I was feeding just one or two cats I'd use the same brand I feed my dogs.<br /><br />10/11/12  What the heck!?  Since I last ordered on the 1st, the price went up from $19.29 to $26.24. Using a can a day, it's not so cost effective now.  Ugh.

review/summary: Good quality cat food at budget friendly price
review/text: I can't say enough about Felidae. It's my favorite budget friendly quality cat food. There are better brands, that's for sure, but they will also help break the bank. Good quality ingredients- no by products, corn, or wheat. High protien. Cranberries for urinary health. The targeted urinary ph for this food is 6.0 which is perfect. These people care about their product and the animals that eat it. This is a good food and you can feel good about feeding it to your cat. :)Good health starts with quality food, and prevents expensive vet bills!

review/summary: My cats loved it, but now won't eat it!
review/text: I recently was looking for a good brand of canned food to add to my cat's diet. Both my cats get dry food in the morning and wet food at night. I liked Felidae because it wasn't too expensive and seems to have excellent ingredients. I would have gone with the grain free option except for the cost. I went to a local pet food supplier to pick up a can of this before I bought a whole case (after reading reviews that some cats won't eat it) and luckily both of mine LOVED it. My male cat has had problems with urinary issues in the past and I wanted to get him off prescription food onto something better so both my cats now get Wysong Uretic dry food in the morning (because I am still paranoid about the struvite crystals my cat had) and Felidae at night. I also plan on switching every other case with Nature's Variety because that is also an excellent food that my cats love. Glad to find a good canned food at an economical price!<br /><br />I originally wrote this review in December. It is now the end of February, and both of my cats are refusing to eat the Felidae food. Luckily I only have 3 cans left from the case I bought, but 2 cans have completely gone to waste. Not sure why my cats suddenly won't eat it, the food looks the same and smells the same as the previous cans from the case. The only thing I can think of is the Nature's Variety food that I am also feeding them is better and they prefer that so they are refusing to eat the Felidae. I have since switched my cats onto all canned food, so it is possible that they only like this when it is offered every once in a while compared to every day or two. I still like the food for the price and ingredients, but unfortunately I won't be buying any more.

review/summary: Good ingredients, reasonably priced, cat likes.
review/text: Ive been quite happy with Felidae canned products.<br /><br />They are reasonably inexpensive if you look at the price per oz which you should always do.<br /><br />The ingredients are noteworthy for several reasons.<br />1) Because of very limited grains.  Cats cant process grains but you have to have something to hold the kibble together. They use alfalfa and brown rice which is better than corn.<br /><br />2) No meat by-products or even 'meal'.  Meal/byproducts could be anything pretty much.  It could be perfectly fine organ meat that humans don't eat a lot of, so theres a good supply.  It could be feathers, gristle, whatever.  It's generally best to avoid when possible.<br /><br />3) The first seven ingredients are meat-based.  This means a very limited amount of filler as an 8th ingredient could only theoretically be less than 12.5% of the whole product by weight.<br /><br />4) The variety of meats is also beneficial, especially inclusion of liver which is nutritious.<br /><br />It is a good idea to feed your cat at least some canned wet food to ensure kitty gets enough water.  We also feed her some dry food as snacks, and have a pet fountain (steel) to encourage water drinking.<br /><br />Best of all, my cat loves it!

review/summary: Limited Tolerance
review/text: Turns out I'm as susceptible to guilt as any other cat parent. I tried to switch my kitty over to super premium food - gradually as is recommended. Which is why it snuck up on me that this food was going to turn out to be a problem. While it was mixed with her old food she was tolerating it fine. She liked it by itself and had no trouble with it for the first few days. Then her poops starting turning really loose and she wouldn't touch it anymore. I tried transitioning onto two more super premium foods with the same results before I realized what the culprit was: one ingredient, flaxseed. All of the foods she had trouble with had it. The one super premium I finally found that she didn't have trouble with didn't have it. Flaxseed is known for greasing the chute so if your cat doesn't have problems in that area that ingredient might not be for you. It's amazing how many super premium brands have that ingredient prominently featured, which means I can't use them. Pity, as otherwise this food is very appealing: texture is dense but soft, the smell reminds me of Campbell's Condensed Chicken Soup (not unappealing for some of us) and the cat obviously liked the flavor before the inevitable reaction overcame it. Ah well, win some lose some. I'm keeping the rest of the carton as an alternate food since she doesn't have problems with it short term, only long term.

review/summary: My picky cats LOVE it
review/text: Texture is nasty by human standards but isn't all cat food? The main things are that our extremely picky cats love it, its grain-free, has truly healthy stuff in it and its much cheaper than other "healthy" cat foods. We only have 2 cats so we have to put some in the fridge each time so as not to overfeed them (the cans we get are 13 oz.) but its worth it and the cats love it so much they even eat it cold right out of the fridge. To start them off I mixed it with a little "cat crack" (friskies) to get them enticed but now they go for it straight up. We were spending around 100/month on food for them and now we will be spending 60 without sacrificing quality. Highly recommended!

I feel as if I have eaten something substantial rather than some of the flimsy store crackers that taste of salt. If you haven't tried them before, go ahead and buy some! They are great with cheese or butter or fruit or plain and, if you are watching calories, you can eat five for 120 calories! Highly recommended.

review/text: The chocolate chips give this delectible shortbread cookie a great twist.

review/text: Although Walker's shortbread are the best, I will not be purchasing them from Amazon again.  The tin arrived quite dented, and all the cookies were broken so I had a can of crumbs.  Very disappointing, and even more disappointing is that when I informed Amazon of the problem, I received no reply.

review/summary: Dogbuscus loves them!
review/text: They are perfectly sized for a training treat, and oh so popular with our buddy. We got our new family dog from a local shelter with zero training. He's 2 years old and super smart but I have not found any type of dog food or treat that he would like, until I found these. Our sweet little comedian of a jack russell has learned to sit, lay and stay this week alone. It has helped him to be more comfortable in his new house, and less frightened of his new kennel. No treat is the wonder drug for every dog, but for our very picky eating friend they were the perfect training treat. I just received this bag last week and they're already gone. I have read in other reviews to order the smaller size because they dry out quickly, but I have found that if they stay sealed they should be keep for a couple weeks. Just make sure you zip the resealable bag every time you use them to make sure they stay chewy and delicious...:)<br />UPDATE: Our dog is such an avid learner I have had to start cutting these very small treats down into quarters. He can earn a half bag at a time, and yes he has to do entire performances to get even one. He has learned that these are the treats he gets from me and won't accept anything else. My son can use his dog food as a treat to practice with him, but he will not accept them from me. The second I walk over to the cupboard where these are kept he is hot on the spot with his tail going a mile a minute. He's 10lbs of picky but would do anything for these. We have had him for 3 weeks and gone through 3 small bags of these. The commands he now knows are as follows; Sit, down, off, stay, "hands up" (sit pretty), "bang" (play dead), crawl, and we are learning speak and quiet. I have no previous training experience or professional help unless you count youtube videos. I'm aware that he is an exceptional dog, but I am grateful for these treats as they have done wonders for both of our skills.

review/text: I thought this would be a pleasant change from the old, tired Cheetos and pork rinds, but I found these a bit on the plain side. They were light and crispy, with the alveoli providing a satisfying crackle at the end, and the flavor was mildly gamey, but it left a little something to be desired. It was just a wee bit too bland...perhaps the addition of a little sea salt or garlic would give these snacks a little more oomph.

But it is not created in a lab - it is a naturally saturated fat that does good things for your health.<br /><br />But, more importantly, Amazon says right on the page the ingredients in this Peanut Butter.  They are:  Peanuts, sugar, palm oil, salt.<br /><br />I think it tastes great, and I love the super crunch of this variety.<br /><br />Enjoy, folks!  This is probably one of the best no refrigeration needed peanut butters out there.

This has to be the best nocciola flavor (chocolate and hazelnut) product there is, anywhere.  It's soft/runny (depending on temperature), so like a spread for toast or whatever, but not really like a sauce -- well, I guess if you warmed it a little it would get fluid like syrup and would be pretty fantastic on ice cream.

I take them whenever I need a dessert and everyone raves about them! We usually buy these at Cosco for around $9-10/box but since we live far from a Cosco I decided to try ordering them online. 2 stars for price and delivery. In the end it was quite a bit more expensive and they sent the wrong size the 5lb box not the 7.5 lb box which increased the cost per batch even more. I complained to the shipper and they did an adjustment but in the end it was still more expensive and a pain to have to follow up like that. Ordering on line is supposed to be easy right? So I don't know if I will order again... but I will keep buying this product because we love them ;-).

review/summary: A versatile low-glycemic sweetener
review/text: I recently jumped on the "primal diet" kick (google it).  Good results for me.  I feel very good and have lost quite a bit of weight.  The reason that it has been quite easy to stay pretty close to the diet is that the food choices are so good.  I enjoy my new food selections more than I did my former (reasonably healthy and moderate) diet.  The food is so rich on the primal diet, that I have become spoiled.  On this diet, there are not many sweeteners that are compliant.  I have found that that a little of this blue agave sweetener to sweeten occasional dishes and drinks is very enjoyable.  Sure beats the heck out of any sugar substitute (aspertame, stevia, etc.) that I have come across.<br /><br />While it adds a bit of flavor other than just sweetness the way sugar does, it is a pleasant flavor (a bit like vanilla) that goes with lots of things.  One example of a way I use it is that I make my own vanilla yogurt by buying plain yogurt, adding the blue agave nectar and some vanilla flavoring.  IMHO it is the equal of any vanilla yogurt you can buy, and can be spooned on top of fresh fruit and topped with pecans for a fantastic dish.  All that without triggering an insulin overload.

review/summary: A Decent Reproduction
review/text: I would encourage anyone who wants a quick, easy, and flavorful rendition of red curry chicken to at least try this. It's "American" spicy, which I wish it was a bit spicier (it is made by ITC after all) but it has been a good staple for me while I am still in school and don't have much time to make my own curries at this point.<br /><br />As the other reviewer stated, it's slightly heavy on Coriander, but I have found that to be refreshing, especially when I add onions. I would recommend eating this with Basmati rice because the nutty flavor also gives a bit of balance to the flavor.<br /><br />These things being said, I have eaten 4 rounds of these 6 packs over the past year--also including butter curry and Hyderabadi Biryani--and have only had one bad experience where the curry was thicker than usual and caused a little overcooking (partly due to my negligence and shoddy saucepans). Everyone that I have cooked for with these packages have also enjoyed them quite a bit as well.<br /><br />The reason why I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is the balance of spiciness (I wish it were more masala than not...but that's easily remedied :) ) and that it is not "identical" to the tastes I experienced in the motherland. I hope this helps!

review/summary: Disappointingly One dimensional
review/text: I think there's a reason these curries are 40% off.  This curry is heavy on turmeric and coriander with a chalky aftertaste.  I've tried to dress it up from caramelized onions and pinc&eacute;d tomatoes to roasted sweet peppers and fond de poulet.  A far superior prepared curry paste is Patak's with a complexity that's intoxicating.

review/summary: Mmmm....
review/text: Previously I'd been having some issues with the other flavors of Extra. The Bubblemint tasted nice but the flavor didn't last & the gum turned way too rubbery too fast. A fruit flavor was good & soft, yet it had a strange aftertaste. But this? This is a wonderful flavor.<br /><br />Not only is the spearmint flavor great, but it lasts a long time & is strong enough to help clear my mouth of that after lunch taste. (You know what I'm talking about.) The gum is incredibly soft & remains soft even after minutes of chewing.<br /><br />While I may not be as fond of the other flavors, I can guarantee that this is something I'll buy again.

review/text: I have loved this gum for years. The flavor is great, but it has an absolutely horrible ingredient I just discovered from my doctor and dentist: Aspartame. I strongly advise anyone looking for gum to find one that does not contain Aspartame. It is very hard to find because any gum that is sold at a Wal-mart has Aspartame in it. Do the research on this ingredient and decide if this is the gum for you before you purchase.

review/text: Over the summer (2010) we were in St. Augustine Florida at a really good little resturant right on the water. We were given a bottle of ketchup to use with dinner.  We had never heard of the brand (Red Gold), but since they didn't have Heinz, we used it.  This was the BEST ketchup we have ever had!!! I've always been a die-hard Heinz Ketchup user, but when we got back home, we tried to locate this item.  It isn't for sale where we live, so we looked it up on the web.  Directly from the company, we would have to buy way too much for our use.  I can't wait for Amazon to have this item!

review/text: The shiritaki noodles are very good. They have great texture, are simple to prepare, and have no funky aftertaste. While I love spaghetti squash as a pasta substitute, these are a nice alternative. They are a bit expensive at $8.95 a bag not counting shipping, but if I could get them at a store sans the shipping costs, I'd probably get them now and again. Certainly isn't what I thought tofu would taste like! A pleasant surprise!

review/summary: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
review/text: I very much wanted to like tofu shirataki noodles. Unfortunately, they are just a little too unusual for my taste. They're not awful, but the texture is very slippery and chewy. As was mentioned in other reviews, even after rinsing and soaking they still have a distinctive smell and taste. A sesame-soy based sauce seems to compliment the shirataki noodles best. (i.e., masks the taste) Spaghetti sauce just doesn't taste right with it. Since this product is not available locally and has to be shipped from New York to Texas at a net cost of about $5 a package, I would be very unlikely to purchase it again.

review/text: I was so hoping to like this product!  I need to eat lower carb foods, and hoped that this product would deliver.  The package came in & the smell was bad, but not as horid as suggested.  After par boiling it was much better.  I cooked the noodles & put on sauce $ cheese.  The texture was not good.  It was like chewing pieces of rubber.  The noodles even squeaked on my teeth sort of like a balloon would sound...wierd.  Suffice it to say that I could not choke down more than a couple of bites.  The worst (and funniest) part was letting my dogs have the plate & watching them first try to chew the noodles, and finally lap only the sauce & cheese up. Save your money.  The shipping was killer on this.

review/text: The faux fettuccini does (as it says ) have a stinky smell which can put you off a little. Once you rinse it off, it does get distinctly better. This is a good product to use as a low calorie, low carb substitute for pasta but texture-wise it is rather rubbery. If you can get past that difference, it is good with sauce. It works especially well in casseroles and soup.

review/summary: So-so product; nothing mind-blowing
review/text: After a disastrous run-in with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRXZKM">Miracle Noodle Shirataki Fettuccini, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>, I decided to try these "tofu shirataki" noodles, which supposedly have a slightly better texture than straight up shirataki.<br /><br />Once again, as with user reviews regarding the aforementioned Miracle Noodles, I am really mystified by all the histrionic reports of a "bad", fishy smell. This is the second time I've opened a shirataki noodle package expecting to be knocked back by a horrible smell, only to smell nothing but a mild odor reminiscent of some soy-based product.<br /><br />As for the noodles themselves, the texture didn't have that strange "cartilage-like" feel of fettucine-style Miracle Noodles. However, they were very rubbery and stretchy, requiring a lot of chewing. Personally, I found nothing offensive about this texture but those expecting it to have the consistency of spaghetti might find themselves disgusted or just plain disappointed by it, since these are being touted as a substitute for pasta.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, these noodles have none. This poses a huge problem for those hoping to turn to them to "lose weight." This becomes all too apparent when you come across recipes from other users for this product. More often than not, the recipes often call for rich, fattening sauces; meats, fish, seafood; and other ingredients that usually bump up the calories a hundred-fold. (One recipe I saw-- kid you not-- involved fried pork sausage!}<br /><br />Why do recipes for shirataki noodles tend to go overboard? Well, since they have no flavor, you can't just boil them up as you would other noodles and eat them with a basic soup base or sauce. You have to literally drown them in tons of other stuff to make them filling. So whatever health benefits you gain by substituting carbs with these shirataki noodles is canceled out by the calories and sodium you wind up tacking on from the sauces and other junk you have to add to make them "work."<br /><br />All in all, a "so-so" product-- not bad, not great. Adventurous chefs and eaters who like to try new things may get a kick out of them, because of the interesting texture and cooking challenge they pose. Dieters on the other hand may want to steer clear. Because these noodles have no taste, they'll find themselves needing to add so many ingredients that they may as well just be cooking a "regular" meal with these as nothing more than a side dish. In addition, this product isn't necessarily the best substitute for pasta, because the texture couldn't be more different. Three stars.

review/text: I was considering order a multi pack of these online, I thought it sounded great enough since I'm on a diet. Luckily I happened upon some single bags at my local grocery store and bought one to try. I made some lovely home made pesto to pour on top. As soon as I opened the bag I noticed the horrid smell! So unappetizing and foul. I rinsed the heck out of them, boiled the noodles up in fresh water, put some in my mouth, and spit it right into the trash. The smell was still there and the texture reminded me of the squishy yet pop-ish texture of shrimp, which thoroughly disgusted me since I'm now vegan. I would not recomend this product to anyone. I just cant get past the odd smell and the worse texture.
