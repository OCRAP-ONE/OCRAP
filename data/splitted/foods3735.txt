review/text: I've been looking for a good low calorie tea as I've been trying to drink less soda. I thought I'd try to find something a little different on Amazon and came across Anteadote. I read the reviews on Oolong, which were generally positive, and gave it a shot. After trying it, all I can say is "Eh," as in it was okay. I drink a fair amount of unsweetened tea and I will say that Anteadote Oolong does have a slightly off taste. Not bad, just off. All in all, it wasn't horrible but probably won't order again. Still looking for something a little better tasting.

review/summary: A pound of stevia!
review/text: I never thought I'd go thru a pound of stevia, but here I am, just ordered my second pound, after taking about 2 years to go thru the first. I love having such a bounty of good quality stevia available, and it is sooooo much cheaper than any other way I've found to buy it. I put some in baggies for friends to try out to see if they like stevia - it's so cheap, it's no great expense if they don't like it.<br /><br />This stevia is great quality, unlike some of the "green"-ish cheaper stevia. Also know that this is the uncut pure stevia - oftentimes companies will mix in some maltodextrose or other mixer to make it less strong and more comparable to sugar in volume. Because stevia is VERY strong - serving size is 1/32 teaspoon, which equals one teaspoon of sugar. On the Now container, they say that it contains 16,214 servings - that cracks me up.<br /><br />I used to buy it at Whole Foods in bulk at $150/pound, and I'd just take the smallest little amount. Then they discountinued selling it bulk because it was so expensive that when moisture got in and ruined it, it was just too expensive for them. So I asked my Whole Foods buddy who the supplier was of their bulk stevia, and he told me it was Now.<br /><br />I use stevia in my tea, my kefir, and in some recipes as a sugar replacement. Often I'll cut the sugar by 1/4 and add in a small amount of stevia. If it is all stevia, it doesn't always taste that great, but when it is blended, one can hardly tell.<br /><br />I also use lakanto, which is better for baking. But unlike stevia, it is not inexpensive. The only place I know to buy it is thru Body Ecology (which is my preferred eating system BTW)[...]

review/text: I am very happy with this product.  The 1 lb container will likely last for years because it takes so little to sweeten my food.  Both my husband and I use this in place of sugar in everything that doesn't require sugar for structure, (like some baked goods).  At first we felt that the sweetness was a little different than sugar but after 2 weeks, we cannot really tell the difference and find on fruit, like berries, it is enhances the fruit flavor in addition to adding a little sweetness, making it better than sugar.  We even had some watermelon that didn't have much flavor or sweetness and once I cut it up and sprinkled a pinch of stevia on it, it tasted like good watermelon.

review/summary: Not worth it
review/text: I have been using KAL stevia powder for some time now, but thought I would try a lesser expensive brand. I have used NOW products, and had good experiences with them, and due to the reviews, I decided to give this a try. What a disappointment.<br /><br />Serving sizes and # of servings is exactly the same, weight for weight. However, I have to use 2 to 4 times the amount of NOW in order to get anywhere near the sweetness of KAL. So, I didn't save any money, and it is evidently not the same grade as the KAL. It has a larger particle, which may be one of the factors in the amount needed. The KAL is a very fine powder. Back to the KAL as soon as I can afford to buy more. This is too much money to waste, and non-returnable, so compare before you buy.

Maybe NOW Foods earlier stevia had an after tatse, but this "Better Stevia" to me is very smooth. So why should you buy this version of Stevia: the price you get on this this pure Stevia, plus it beats FILLER ADDED store brand Stevia! My only beef is the new container thye use is so big that it's only half filled, why not sell me 2 LBS in this jar? I'd buy it.

review/summary: It really is Better Stevia!
review/text: This stevia is a highly concentrated white powder that requires very little to sweeten my ice tea.  I once used sugar, then switched to my wife's artificial sweetener, however upon reading about stevia, I decided to try it.  I went through a number of brands and packages, most of which were pretty good, but then I found this.  This has the best flavor of all the different stevia formulations I have tried.  If you use the right amount, it is very hard to tell the difference in taste from actual sugar.  I drink from a very large insulated tea container (28 oz.) and with this stevia, it takes less than 1/4 teaspoon to sweeten my tea.  That means that a little 4 oz bottle of this powder lasts months (it is even more economical in the 1 lb jar).  Now Foods has hit a home run with this product.  By the way, they make several stevia products.  Just make sure you get the one labeled "Better Stevia", because it truly lives up to its label.

review/summary: High quality stevia
review/text: I've used stevia for close to 20 years now. I put it in tea, coffee, on fruit salad and in baking. Some people claim that stevia has a bitter aftertaste, and some brands can have that problem, but not this one.<br /><br />This stevia is finely ground and exceptionally pure. The label states, under Supplement Facts:<br /><br />Stevia Extract Powder (leaf) (stevia rebaudiana, min. 80% glucosylsteviosides). Other ingredients: None. Stevia Extract is hypoallergenic and contains no sugar, salt, starch, yeast, wheat, gluten, corn, soy, milk, egg or preservatives.<br /><br />Some people claim that stevia is 200 times sweeter than table sugar. In my experience, it is about 8 times as sweet. If you have never used it before, I wouldn't start with a 1 lb. container. I'd start small, such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LIGPR6">one-ounce size</a>.<br /><br />As for baking with stevia, for puddings and pies, you could probably get away with using it as your only sweetener. But for cakes, cookies and muffins, it won't give you the same texture as sugar and doesn't work for that except as a supplement to other natural sweeteners such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UGMH9Y">coconut palm sugar</a>.

review/text: Have to agree with bella voce. I've been using the KAL Stevia very happily for a couple of years. Saw this and did the math, and instead of 6 dollars (approximately) per ounce for the KAL, this worked out to a little more 3 dollars per ounce. Sounded good.<br /><br />Well, using the same small spoon that comes with the KAL Stevia (one of those nicely sweetens a good sized Cafe Americano or double shot of espresso), this Now brand Stevia was NOWHERE near as sweet. Had to use 2.5-3 times as much to get the same flavor. Also, and this is subjective, the flavor of the KAL tastes better to me.<br /><br />Still, it's Stevia, and not sugar or one of the artificial sweeteners, so it's got that going for it. But if you're looking at this as a bargain compared to the KAL, it's not: You get what you pay for.

review/summary: Perfect healthy sugar replacement
review/text: This is my second pound jar of stevia. We love it for everything except baking and it takes such a small amount to get just the right sweetness. My husband likes to take a zero calory drink for his lunch and just a half teaspoon of this product replaces a cup of sugar to sweeten a package of Kool Ade. This was a quickly shipped item and is concentrated 100% stevia extract powder.

As soon as it had arrived, I made it for dinner that same night and it was just as I remembered...AWESOME!  Since the directions on this bag are in bulk, to make a large quantity, I had to research a bit to find the correct amount to use for home use. I hope this helps you!<br />1 Envelope (the way it used to be sold) = 2 Tbsp + 2 tsp.<br />Here are the directions that used to be on the old boxes, since it will not be on this large bag.<br /><br />In medium saucepan, combine 1 envelope, 1 Tbsp Oil, desired tomatoes & water (see below). Bring to a boil, then simmer stirring frequently. Makes 1 pint of sauce (Four-1/2 cup servings)<br /><br />1 can (15oz) tomato puree & 3/4 cup water<br />OR<br />2 cups crushed tomatoes (16oz) & 1/2 cup water<br />OR<br />1 can (6 oz) tomato paste & 1 1/2 cups water<br /><br />I hope I have helped!

I found these at the pet store and the dogs were wild for them. I bought one bag at the store. I went online to Amazon and found them way cheaper. Then I was offered a "subscription" to them where I could save even more money. I chose two packages (the subscription required two packs) once a month. Wasn't enough. I now get two packs twice a month. These are just sensational. Only one problem---dogs get up an hour earlier now to get one!!!!

But 2 pounds of tea leaves is a huge amount! Although it is light in weight, the bag it comes in is bigger than a 5-lb. bag of Coffee Bean coffee, also available here from Amazon. We keep this in an air-tight glass canister in the pantry, but there's still so much to use. So, we wonder: will it lose its flavor like the spearmint gum on the bedpost overnight...? ;-)

review/summary: good nana tea
review/text: 2 pounds is a lot of peppermint unless you REALLY love this kind of tea.  other drinkers looking only to sample here may want to keep most of your leaf stored in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UEFMWE">Ziploc Vacuum Bags, Gallon, 8-Count(Pack of 3)</a>.  I suggest you use this leaf to mix 50/50 with Green or White leaf to help dull any unpleasant leafy taste you may like to avoid with those teas.  this peppermint tea also makes a great addition to popery, though a peppermint oil would probably hold it's smell longer.  Coffee Bean Direct impressed me by shipping 2lbs by weight, not by volume.  the leaf are small 3mm bits, so large hole steepers may not work well - you may need a strainer or paper filter to brew this clean.

review/summary: Very fragrant tea, well worth the price
review/text: I had accidentally ordered this tea for use during the Lemonade Master Cleanse, but gave it away because it was not organic. When my friends and I tried it, the aroma from opening the bag was intensely pepperminty. This tea is more flavorful than Wegman's organic peppermint tea, but that might be because Wegman's teas have been exposed to a lot more air.<br /><br />The minty taste was very strong but not overpowering or bitter, and I think I used about a Tbsp for 10 ounces of hot (not boiling) water. My vegan organic friends stated that it was a very good tea. So if you don't care whether a tea is organic, you can't beat the value.<br /><br />As a non-organic tea, I give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Super bargain!
review/text: I ordered two 2 lb bags of tea. The first one looked like a standard 2 lb bag but I couldn't understand why the shipping carton was so big. Then I removed the peppermint bag and all was revealed: By measurement, the 2 lb peppermint bag was 4-5 times the volume of the other 2 lb bag. In other words, you are going to get a lot of tea for your money. I experimented with amount needed to brew a good tasting batch and I found that I should use the same amount (volume) I would of a heavier tea. Therefore, you are getting 4-5 times the amount of brewed tea for the same price. The tea tastes very good, about four and a half stars. I made it five stars because of the super bargain. The taste is very minty with a subtle bitter tea back taste. I don't use sweetener but this is one tea that might improve with a little.

review/text: This coffee is very good. It is a nice change from the other Senseo pods. I have been buying more pods from Melitta and others just to change it up.  It was nice to try one from Senseo.  The chocolate is subtle, as others have mentioned.  But you can tell its there. I recommend it!!

review/summary: Irresponsible Seller
review/text: Don't buy this product, they'll cheat you out of your money.  You'll just waste the shipping charges, and your time.  They sent me the wrong flavor pods, for the wrong machine.  Now I have a bunch of Tassio coffee pods that I can't use, and I have to find the time to send it all back, and then get them to refund me the shipping because I refuse to pay for their error.  In fact, it wasn't even from the listed seller, it was sent from Bed Bath & Beyond!  I don't know what's going on here, but these people are liars and thieves.

review/text: This coffee isn't that bad I would recommend it to anyone because if you put some hazelnut liquid coffee creamer in it, its the best cup of coffee you have ever had.

review/text: I am an espresso purist and rarely imbibe "fru-fru" flavored coffee.  I had bought this for women friends and when I tried it...wow!  It is really an excellent brew.  Use only a real (Senseo or other pump-type) espresso machine, there are other AWFUL pod machines that churn out colored water(see my other reviews).  Thank Godiva for Godiva, they came through again.

review/summary: Even Starbucks people will find these pods DELICIOUS A++
review/text: The Godiva pods have an excellent flavor for both arabica coffee lovers and chocolate lovers.  We've drunk our 3pm coffee with chocolate for years, since discovering the rather fattening Starbucks mocha coffee. (It's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PS0">Lipton Green Tea, Mandarin Orange, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> green tea in the morning for us now, as no 11 o'clock droop with it.) The Godiva coffee is a delicious arabica medium roast similar to the great <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBJ3U2">Senseo Douwe Egberts Colombia Blend Coffee Pods, 16-Count 3.92-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> you can only get on Amazon.  I use 2 pods per cup, but we're chickens so I make this with 25% <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBH9YE">Senseo Douwe Egberts Coffee Pods, Decaffeinated, 18-Count 4.41-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> and it tasts great and lowers the buzz level to manageable.  If you want a different taste you can make it 25% dark with a pod of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013A0QXC">Senseo Espresso Coffee Pods, 16-Count, 3.92-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>.  Any way it is great by us.  We like it with a little Starbucks mocha powder added (1T rounded/cup) + a dash of Starbucks Carmel Sauce.  I avoid some white sugar by sweeting to taste with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5T52">Emerald Forest  Xylitol Sweetener, 2 Pound Composite Containers (Pack of 2)</a> which also saves your teeth.  The taste is the same as table sugar.<br /><br />Avoid the fat of the Starbucks mocha drinks by making frothy milk to pour over your coffee with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WCXOTA">BonJour Caf&eacute; Latte Frother, Battery Powered, White/ Gray</a>.  The taste is just like whipped cream without the calories.  You will be amazed.<br /><br />Big Secret:  you do not even need a Senseo Coffee Machine to use these pods.  Just brew them in hot water for 5 minutes to taste before you add milk.  The machine just does a little finer extraction and puts some tasty foam on top.  You can put your own frothed milk on top instead if you take it.

review/summary: uhh, 99 cents more than at the store.
review/text: Its my understanding the the idea to buying bulk is that the per unit cost decreases versus going to the store and buying one unit. Its this principal that lets stores make money. Now. I've done the math and 45.99/12=3.83. Something look wrong to you? I buy a can or two every day, and at 7-11, quick-chek, wawa, etc,they cost 3.00 or 3.50 if they feel expensive that day, sometimes a deal 2 for 4. Amazon is the only seller of these bulk on the web (besides the starbucks supplier stores use) so they know they can gouge pries. My recommendation is to go to the nearest 7-11 and buy 12 for 36 dollars and avoid amazon all together.There are things they are great for, buying energy drinks in bulk isn't one of them.

review/summary: Great Product - Too High Price
review/text: I love this stuff.  I could drink 3 or more cans every day.  It has that perfect blend of coffee and chocolate and gives me a boost.<br /><br /> What I find odd is the price here.  I got excited discovering that I could buy in bulk as compared to 1 can at a time at local gas stations.  As others stated, I assumed the price per can would go way down because of the quantity.  Well, at $50 per 12 pack it's well over the cost of my 1 can-at-a-time cost at gas stations!  I pay from $2.29 to $2.69 locally while this Amazon cost is $4.11 per can.  What's the point in buying in bulk if the price goes up??  And I'm not even considering shipping cost.<br /><br /> As a price threshold, for me if the price exceeds $30 for a 12 pack, I say forget it.

review/summary: Expensively delicious for Starbucks Fanatics
review/text: Starbucks is known all over the world for producing quality coffee but with a price of $79.99 for a pack of 12 I believe this is too much to ask for. Other brands can offer the same quality of taste and energy boosting effect but at a cheaper price. If name is all we are buying in this product then I hope Starbucks should better think about it soon.<br /><br />There are different reasons why men and women purchase a cup or a can of coffee. Some want it for the sake of leisure while others wish to have an additional energy booster. But many have grown accustomed to the taste of quality coffee beans so they stick with popular brands like Starbucks.<br /><br />Starbucks Doubleshot sure comes in handy since you can carry it around wherever you may go. You can instantly have that needed jolt of energy so you can finish your pile of office paperworks or school assignments. Instead of walking over to a starbucks cafe then you can readily cool it in the fridge so you can readily enjoy it anytime.<br /><br />The problem with caffeinated drinks is that the energy effects will not last for so long. Most of the time the mental alertness will only keep you going for a maximum of 12 hours. I have personally tried it and no matter how much I wanted to sleep the amount of caffeine was not yet used so was awake until 12 noon. Soon after, my eyes felt tired and I was off to sleep.<br /><br />I had no problems like this with my regular Gene Eden Vir 101 supplement. It gives me longer lasting energy without any side effect. I take it three times in a day and can feel how it helps my body work efficiently without any complaints.<br /><br />Choose the coffee drinks you will take but if you are indeed a fan of Starbucks then having a pack of Doubleshot in your fridge will definitely be a delight not only to you but also to your coffee buddies.

review/summary: Licorice Bridge mix
review/text: The licorice was fresh and excellent as usual. This was the second time I had ordered from this vendor. I ordered four pounds, which were shipped in four individual hard plastic containers in a cardboard box. Each container was about 3/4 full. During shipping one of the boxes came open and a couple handfuls of licorice went everywhere in the shipping box. I had sent the package to a friend's house and fortunately the kids weren't too particular about searching for the loose candy in the folds of the box, although I'm not too sure how healthy that was. I'd recommend a different size or type of container for the future. Also, I didn't know if I should have reported it to the shipping company. I live outside of the US and don't know the expectations or allowances for this type of problem. In addition, it seemed to take a while to reach the address in Portand, Oregon - maybe eight days or more. Perhaps that's normal for the US. I would order again from this vendor.

review/summary: Solid God Katz-N-Flocken Dry Cat Food
review/text: I ordered this discounted food knowing the discount would off set the shipping.  My cats LOVE this cat food, I've fed it to them for years and will keep buying it.  Solid Gold is an excellent brand, never had any of the cat food recalls.  So I felt I made a wise decision even though the product listed didn't include the size bag.  Turns out the size was a 4 lb bag, still a savings with the discount.  I've also ordered through PetFood Direct, never had a problem with their service or with their products.  The drawback was the bag was expired.  Ordered 12/10 and expired 2/10.  I am very disappointed I spent the money on expired food which I will not feed my pets.  There is a reason why a manufacturer puts an expiration date on their food.  So no, I won't order this product again and I wonder if that was what the discount was all about - Getting rid of expired food the only way they could.  I won't order dry cat food on line again, not through PetFood Direct, not when their people do this to a customer.

review/summary: Cats Initially Goobled Up This Food. Interest Waned ater a Month.  Wish I Could Pronounce Some of the Ingredients.
review/text: Since my cats are getting older, I decided to supplement their dry food with a daily can of wet food.  I orginally had them eating Friskies Special Diet canned food because of a friend's recommendation; however, one of my cats had an allergic reaction to the Friskies.<br /><br />My cats are already eating <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>, so I tried out this Organix Turkey and Seafood as well as Castor and Pollux Natural Ultramix Chicken and Vegetables Casserole Adult Feline Canned Formula.<br /><br />All of our cats, young & old, like this Organix food. Even the allergy cat seems to tolerate this canned food.  It is a typical canned cat food consistency (no chunks of meat - kind of a mush - easy to remove from the can).  My only hesitation is that the ingredients do not seem to be completely "organic", and I cannot pronounce some of the ingredients.  However, with any commercially manufactured pet food, I believe you have to "settle", and this food seems to be of a higher quality than other similarly priced cat food which contain meat by-products.<br /><br />NOTE: after about 1 month of eating this food on a daily basis, only 3 of my 5 cats will eat all of their food.  The other two nibble at the food & then walk away.<br /><br />Ingredient list:<br />Organic Turkey, Salmon broth, organic chicken liver, organic brown rice, organic chicken, shrimp, organic guar gum, calcium sulfate, tricalcium phosphate, organic flaxseed meal, salt, potassium chloride, minerals (iron amino acid, chelate, zinc amino acid chelate, cobalt amino acid chelate, copper amino acid chelate, manganese amino acid chelate, sodium selenite, potassium iodide), vitamins (vitamin E, A, D3, B12 Supplements, thiamine mononitrate, niacin, d-calcium pantothenate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, folic acid, biotin), taurine, choline chloride.<br /><br />Guaranteed Analysis:<br />crude protein (min) 8.0%, crude fat (min) 6.0%, crude fiber (max) 1.0%, crude moisture (max) 78.0%, ash (max) 1.8%, magnesium (max) 0.03%, taurine (min) 0.05%<br /><br />Made in the USA.

And I love that my kittens cry as soon as the cans clink when I get them out.<br /><br />Wherever they are in the house, they come running and cry cry cry until I set the food down.<br /><br />They usually gobble up a bit, and then leave some in the dish to save for later. They always finish their portions before the next day.<br /><br />With the 3 oz I feed 1 can per cat for dinner usually. Then after it's done I free feed dry, which they nibble at but don't eat a ton. I used to have set feeding times with measured amounts, but found them to gorge. Now that I free feed they eat more sparingly and throughout the day.<br /><br />Love this, love the can size, and love that it's subscribe and save ready - makes it affordable for mom.

review/text: way too weak, hardly tastes like coffee.  I wish that Starbucks or Seattle's Best would produce a decaffeinated T-disc.

review/summary: Delicious coffee/cappucino
review/text: The decaf Gevalia coffee and cappucino are delicious and come out perfect every time in the Tassimo. Unfortunately, they're the only 2 varieties of decaf coffee they have available currently, but both are excellent and come very close to coffee house quality.
