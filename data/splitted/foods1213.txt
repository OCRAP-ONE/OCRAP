review/summary: Makes the perfect Dirty Martini
review/text: I love dirty martini's, but have always been so frustrated that I use the juice in the olive jar before I finish all the olives.  And when I try to make more juice with those olives, it never tastes right.  This Dirty Sue mix is absolute amazing!!!!!  I highly recommend this product, it's just perfect for a good dirty martini

review/text: I love dirt martinis. Martini bars like Blue Martini in Miami, never do it right. To little olive juice or they simply don't have enough to offer, so they skimp out. Dirty sue does do it right! If I can only bring this bottle to the Martini bars with me! Kettle one and this product will make your mouth water. Spend the extra bucks on these bottles, and you won't regret it.

review/summary: Great for beer too
review/text: I like to put olive juice in my beers, don't really like the olives plus they're pretty fatty, so I would just use the juice and go through jars of olives super fast!  I found Dirty Sue and I will never use jar olives again!  I tried another brand once because it was cheaper but it was way too salty and not enough olive flavor.  I love this stuff!!!  Only drawback is the price, but a jar of olives costs about $3 and lasts about 8 beers, where this stuff is about $8 a bottle and lasts about 16 beers.  So all in all it's only a little bit more.

review/summary: Down and Dirty
review/text: First, a disclaimer: Dirty Sue's is the first olive juice I've purchased, so I can't compare it to other brands. To my taste, it's not exactly on par with the liquid from a jar of real olives, but it still has an acceptable flavor. I suggest adding a little at a time, and then taste, rather than starting with a lot and having it end up too salty. My recipe calls for Grey Goose Vodka straight from the freezer and blue-cheese-stuffed olives (the best I've tasted come from the olive bar at Safeway supermarkets in the West)--the result: Heaven!

review/summary: I love Dirty Sue!
review/text: "Dirty Sue" is everything I ever wanted in a girl friend to share a martini with me! This is an excellent product and certainly solves the age-old problem of running out of juice before the last olive is used up. It also comes in  handy for "topping up" an olive bottle that you've used before. The only thing I'd have liked to see would have been a recommendation of just how much product to add for differing levels of "dirtyness": a little dirty, medium dirty, and down-in-the-mud-and-'rasslin' dirty. It took a good bit of trial and error to find the proper balance, and I haven't drunk that many martinis since the night after my divorce! (Just kidding!)

review/summary: I Feel So Dirty...  and I Like It!
review/text: I am a fan of the dirty martini.  I am not a fan of dried out olives sitting uncovered in a jar that has been drained of its juice...<br /><br />I had tried another olive brine substitute at a local watering hole but was very unimpressed.  I could make better salt-water on the stove.  My favorite bartender had experienced disappointment after disappointment with similar products.  She viewed my purchase as a waste of money when I told her that I had placed the Dirty Sue order.  She just did not think a good dirty martini mix was out there to be found.  We were both pleasantly surprised when the Dirty Sue shipment showed up.<br /><br />This is not a fake, designed-in-a-lab product that kinda sort of tastes remotely like olives.  This stuff is real.  It is good. I highly recommend it to anyone who is trying to figure out a better use for all those dried out olive jars stuck in the back of the fridge...

review/summary: A little disappointed
review/text: I was so excited to finally have olive juice without the olives.  I can clear out the back of the fridge and all those dessicated olives.  I had read wonderful reviews of Dirty Sue's and was pleased to see I could get it through Amazon and not pay the expensive shipping from the dirty sue website.  So yippee, I went ahead and bought the 4 pack.  Now I probably have three more bottles than I care to have.<br /><br />Its not that its bad.  Its just not what I've come accustomed to when adding olive juice to my martini from the Goya olive jar.  The dirty sue is a subtler flavor and lacks the zest and salt of the juice from the jar.<br /><br />If you're expecting it to be the same as what you've been having from your olives but without the olives, than think twice before ordering all 4 bottles.

review/text: My wife loves Dirty Martini's so I thought I would surprise her with some olive juice. Found the Dirty Sue product on Amazon. I ordered it and when it came, I told her I bought her something I knew she would love. She opened it and, of course, using her usual recipe, mixed herself a dirty martini. Her response:<br />"YUCK". What's wrong? Too bitter, not salty enough, not "olivey" enough. The martini went in the sink. She is still using the brine from green olives and I have 3 full bottles and most of a 4th in the pantry. Won't try any of those products again!

review/summary: Tasty popcorn that doesn't get stuck between your teeth!
review/text: Okay, maybe the heading exagerates just a tad... Red Popcorn has a MUCH more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops, it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear.  When it pops, it looks pretty much like any other popcorn, except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual.  The meet is white, but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them.  You would never know that the pretty, white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping.<br /><br />The flavor is great!  It smelled "toastier" as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried.  We tried it all different ways, with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good.<br /><br />We also liked the fact that it is grown by Amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the "old way."  They believe in sustainable farming and a clean, wholesome way of life.  No ConAgra multi-national conglomerates here, just real, individual farmers making a living off their land.<br /><br />Great products raised and produced by real farmers.  What better reasons do you need to buy some of this really tasty popcorn!?

review/text: We hate to leave this kind of review especially when we have enjoyed this product so much in the past.  Purchased this item in June 2011 and placed it in our kitchen cupboard upon arrival.  Two weeks ago, we were watching a movie and decided to have some popcorn.  Grabbed the new bag of Wabash (purple) and opened it.  Moths came flying out of the bag.  Yes, moths!!  Quickly closed the bag and to our dismay saw many, many moths crawling around inside the bag.  Did some internet research and found the moths are called Indian Meal Moths.  We have never seen these critters in our kitchen before and are sure they came with the popcorn.  We did a complete clean out of our cupboards and have not found them in any other products.  We wrote an email to Wabash Valley thru Amazon about this incident two weeks ago and have heard nothing back.  We would have thought they would pony up and at least offer an apology, if not a complete refund.  We realize that this kind of thing happens and are saddened by their lack of response and responsibility.  It's just not good business.  They have our money after all.

review/summary: So-so popcorn
review/text: With all the great reviews of this red popcorn, I wanted to love it. But frankly, I was underwhelmed. It's a hassle with an air popper, as the kernels tend to fly out before they've popped. What does pop is rather small. I would not buy this popcorn again. The purple is much better.

review/summary: The BEST popcorn I think I've ever had!
review/text: Ok- I read the reviews and wasn't sure if I should buy 12 lbs of popcorn. We just like to eat it a few times a week. I have to say, I'm usually a butter lover when it comes to popcorn. But, not with this. No butter is needed with these tasty kernels! The kernels are very white when they pop and small so they have a great mouth feel. All of them popped and the crunch was tender, yet crisp. All I did was toss on a little popcorn salt and I'm not sure it even needed that. I've never had popcorn so good! This is worth a try!

review/summary: Delicious gourmet popcorn!
review/text: This is by far my favorite popcorn of all time. Petite, fluffy kernels are delicious and light as air. I pop this several times a week in my Back to Basics popper. One thing to keep in mind: the kernels pop up quite a bit smaller than ordinary corn, so you should measure out more, to fill up the popper. For instance, normally I measure out nearly a half-cup of ordinary corn, but for the Vintage Red I usually use almost 3/4 cup. Happy popping!

review/summary: Vintage Red a Hit with our family
review/text: I appreciated that this popcorn wasn't full of big hulls like regular popcorn is, and that it is more dense and crunchy than "movie style" popcorn. After eating the Vintage Red, regular popcorn seems kind of like styrofoam. The only thing I noticed that you need to watch for is that with some of the gourmet popcorns, shipping is more expensive than the popcorn itself.

review/summary: Ok, but will look for something better
review/text: This popping corn is a mix of pros and cons for us.  It came in a clear plastic bag with the pretty red label.  Very colorful corn - lots of dark red with a few kernels of white mixed in.  As some of the other reviewers have said, for a hot air popper, you'll definitely want to tip the popper backward the minute you plug it in or else the air pressure will send kernels flying around your kitchen like schrapnel.  Trust me - you'll be ducking for cover and then finding kernels for the next year or so.  I did not let go of my hot air popper until there was a good amount of popped corn to weigh down the unpopped kernels.  These kernels are noticeably smaller than others you'll see in the grocery store so when they pop, the end result is smaller.  If you have shag carpet, this is probably not a good thing.  The husks are softer and tend to cause less damage to your gums if they get caughtin your teeth, though it won't happen often.  The cost for this little bag is also significantly higher than we'd want to pay again.  Another big con for us is the number of unpopped kernels that remain - probably 1 - 2 dozen per 1/2 cup batch.  For the cost, that's too much.  We'll be trying something else next time.

review/summary: Seems average in taste, possibly not compatible with all hot air poppers
review/text: I purchased this popcorn along with a top rated hot air popper. I believe that because the kernels are smaller and lighter, if your hot air popper has a lot of power, be prepared to have the kernels fly all over until the point they start to pop. The popped kernels are definitely smaller than normal popcorn and frankly, I  do not find the popcorn fluffier or less "husky". In fact, I am fighting the urge to pick my teeth as I write! All of this may be due to the fact that I am using a hot air popper. It is nice to know the corn is organic, but I am a little mad at myself for purchasing a 10 year supply! ;)

review/text: I was looking for a hulless popcorn (due to my diverticulitis, boy do I miss popcorn) and tried this based on the reviews. I was disappointed that this has way to many hulls for ME (the hulls do not disappear or get so small) but the flavor of the popcorn is amazing, very very tasty, my family loves it so I will buy it again.  We air popped it, sprayed it with a little cooking oil and sprinkled some popcorn flavored seasoning "butter."  Hardly any calories but lots of taste :) They are tiny when they pop so you really should not flood it with anything heavy or it will turn to mush.

review/text: I started ordering popcorn from Amazon because out local grocery stores only sell one brand of regular popcorn. Most of the popcorn they sell is microwave. Since there is only one to buy, there is no comparison price shopping and the stores seem to be taking advantage of this. This was very tasty popcorn. I tried many of the different Amish Country Brand popcorns. This was by far the best. The price is very reasonable even taking shipping into consideration.

I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick.  This is because I have severe allergies to wheat and soy.  Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants.  So when I found Nana's cookies I was as happy as can be.  Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it's better than going without cookies.  It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious.  If you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are  a very welcome addition to that diet.

After eating it, [the taste and texture was not bad] I became sick in the way that I always do when ingesting gluten. Nana's also makes non-gluten products, and clearly are not careful about cross-contamination.  If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.  I also think that the company should not deceive their customers, many who suffer from celiac disease, and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product.

review/text: My kids love these and I feel good about giving them to them. They're all natural and sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar. We like to pop them in the microwave for about 10 seconds - then they taste like fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookies. Yum.

review/summary: Great for those on a limited diet
review/text: My 3 year old son was just diagnosed with allergies to wheat, egg and milk.  I was so upset when I found out but a little relieved as I started finding foods he can eat.  Yes, they are crumbly but they taste good, my kids like them and they meet his new dietary restrictions.  Since the option is not giving a 3 year old cookies I don't mind some crumbs!

review/summary: Just Terrible.
review/text: We have a gluten free household of 5.  No one in our family likes these.  My children (9, 7, &5) are begging me to throw the box away - I think they are afraid I'll sneak one in their lunchbox.  The cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth.  Have a glass of water nearby if you try these.  I hate to leave a bad review, but there are way better gluten free options out there.<br /><br />(I won't throw the box away.  I'll pass it on to another gluten free family I know and let them form their own opinion.)

review/summary: Makes a nice gluten-free strawberry shortcake.
review/text: Nana's cookies are good eaten plain.  They are a bit crumbly compared to cookies made with wheat flour.<br /><br />The cookies are individually packaged.  I find it better to cut the plastic open with scissors to avoid breaking the cookies.<br /><br />If you want the cookies crumbled, just break them up in the packaging and then cut open with scissors to dispense neatly.<br /><br />I like to cut up strawberries and crumble a Nana's cookie over them.  With a little whipped cream, it's just like a good strawberry shortcake.  They are great crumbled over bananas, too.<br /><br />Despite being somewhat fragile.  Nana's cookies from Amazon usually arrive intact.

review/summary: Nana Banana - a delicious gluten-free treat for kids or adults!
review/text: Let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten-free world, baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the "glue" (gluten) that holds them together.  Taking this into consideration, Nana's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar.<br /><br />At only 130 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, and 7 grams of sugar (natural fruit sugar), the Nana Banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults.  The amount of banana is just right, and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside.<br /><br />Each cookie measures approximately 3.5 inches long by 1.5 inches wide...perfect for a light snack or dessert, especially for kids.  Amazon has the best price around on Nana's Cookie Bars, so rest assured that you are getting a good deal, even though they are pricier than "regular" cookies made with corn syrup and sugar.<br /><br />Good cookies aren't cheap, and cheap cookies aren't good!  Give Nana's banana cookies a try.  (No, I don't work for Nana's but am a happy, loyal customer!)

review/summary: a Chocolate treat
review/text: My 2 year old eats the Chocolate Munch Cookie and LOVES them. I bought them not because they were gluten free, but because they are sweetener free. He calls them "chocolate treat," if that gives you any indication of how good he thinks they are. I would definitely recommend this flavor to everyone. I have found that with the subscribe and save discount I can get the boxes cheaper on Amazon than in stores like Sunflower, Sprouts and Whole Foods.

review/summary: Disappointed in texture
review/text: It is close to impossible to find a cookie that is both soy free, wheat free, and the only sugar that is used is from natural juices: apple, etc. That is the only reason I gave the cookie such a high ranking...<br />As for taste, the chocolate flavor is pronounced, I enjoy the "crunch", however, the texture of the cookie has a lot to be desired. The cookie needs to either be crunchier or more moist. As is it wants to stick to the roof of your mouth, and is just odd. Making it unappealing. If I had tasted the item prior to ordering, I wouldn't have bought a whole box full.

review/text: I love these banana cookies even though I can eat any other brand/ingredient.  Yes, the texture is DIFFERENT, but that's what I really like about them.  It kind of reminds me of mexican wedding cookies -dry, melt in your mouth texture.  They are really expensive compared to name/store brand cookies, so I have to maintain my self-control and eat only one every few days :(

review/text: I tried the Nana's Bananas cookie bars for the first time this week. I love them! I don't have any gluten issues so I can't speak for that, but I really enjoyed the real banana taste of these cookies. Some people complained about the drier texture, which I will admit is a little different than an actual cookie, but it I always have it with something to drink anyway so the drier texture is not a problem for me. The cookies are nice and soft and there are little delicious crunchy bits in the mix. I bring them to work for a nice afternoon snack :) I will definitely be buying them again soon!

review/text: The berry vanilla is one of my favorite from Nana's.  I also like the chocolate munch when I am wanting something with a chocolate flavor.  They are dry amd crumble.  That doesn't bother me.  I have been gluten-free for five years and have tried near everything.  Nana's has become part of my weekly grocery list.  They are easy to take on the go.  I think these would be great for parents with allergic children because they are packaged for on the go.  It can be frustrating to be out and you suddenly get hungry and there is nothing gluten-free to be found.

review/text: Our family has members who keep kosher, who are vegetarians, who are unable to eat gluten, etc.  This cookie covers all the bases, but tends to be soft and not entirely tasty.  However, they can be used to make a gluten free pie crust, which is a great feature.  I have the feeling that if they were baked a little longer they would be better.<br /><br />Really, though, how good can a gluten free cookie be?

NO eggs, NO dairy, NO refined sugar, NO hydrogenated oils, NO Cholesterol, NO Casein, NO Soy, NO Corn.  They are made from natural ingredients and sweetened with fruit juice.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, for the average person these do not taste like a regular cookie.  I do not personally like the texture, but the chocolate flavor is good.  I will say that this is a wonderful product for people with food allergies, but not someone who can have regular cookies.

review/text: These cookie bars are fudgy and yummy and tasty and healthy and...<br />So good!!  I am a big fan of these.  When I order a case of these I always think, "man that is a lot of cookie bars!  I am probably not going to be able to finish them all."  Probably being the operative word.  Well low and behold (with the help of my husband and 6 year old daughter) they are gone quickly and we are ordering more.  If you are adding more whole wheat to your diet, these work.  If you are looking to get rid of refined sugar in your diet, these work.  If you order them and don't like them: you must have been one of those really picky kids that grew up to be a picky adult!  They are fabulous!  To eat them is to love them.

review/text: My 8 year old son has numerous allergies plus autism and these cookie bars are a life saver!  They're made with fruit juice as opposed to cane sugar, so I don't feel bad about giving them to him.  We've tried many gluten free cookies, these are by far his favorites!  Unfortunately the local stores don't keep them well stocked, so I'm glad I found them here.  If you're not used to gluten free products, you probably won't like them.  The texture is very different than wheat, but if you haven't had wheat in quite a while, these are very tasty and not as crumbly as other gluten free products.  They are fabulous cookies and I'm so glad Nana's makes them...don't ever stop!

review/summary: Cookies you don't have to feel guilty about eating!
review/text: I was excited to find Nana's line of gluten-free cookies, and have tried all the varieties that they offer. Of the various flavors and styles of cookies, these are my favorite. I find their individually packaged cookies (the large, round ones) to be way too heavy for one meal and end up splitting them for two snacks. These 8 pack cookies are the perfect size for a little snack or to keep in your purse. I can understand why some reviewers might not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste, and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals. I happen to like the berry crystals, and it's nice to eat a cookie that you don't have to feel dietary guilt over! A great "hearty" cookie that goes well with coffee or tea.  Also, I am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever. In my opinion, a good product. However, because it is natural and doesn't have preservatives, the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging, the better. I have noticed that Nana's cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around, even sealed. Probably a good idea to try this product before buying a case of it, because I have noticed that people either seem to love or hate the Nana cookies.

The taste of these bars is very banana-y<br />but I doubt you'll be able to ignor the texture long enough to enjoy that. The texture is akin to eating a handful of dirt (I'm no dirt-eating pro...but when I was trying to chew that's all I kept thinking). Please...if you're thinking about trying these...go down to your local natural foods market and pick up a box there first...while you're at it you may want to get some of your favorite soymilk...and lots of it!<br /><br />PS<br />If you're in the market for a yummy vegan bar...try the Betty Lous brand...The strawberry is super good!
