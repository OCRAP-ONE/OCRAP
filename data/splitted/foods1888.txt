review/summary: Wonderfully Healthy Food for Cats
review/text: I switched my cat to this food a couple of months ago and am very happy that I did. The transition to the new food was easy. My cat took to it right away. I've noticed his poop doesn't smell as bad as it did while on the cheaper brands of cat food and am thrilled to know that he is eating healthier. Very happy with this product and purchase.

review/summary: Great food bad smell!
review/text: Ok so I have 2 cats. One is older and the other is about half his age. We have had problems with the younger one scratching until he has bald patches and bloody scabs. Since eating this food he has almost stopped with the scratching and the wounds he has inflicted are starting to heal. Thank god! Pretty sure it was a gluten intolerance that was causing the problem. Having said that. They have only been eating this food for about a week or so. They seem to love the taste they don't throw it up nearly as much as the last food we gave them and that food was even more expensive. We give them the wilderness duck flavor. I don't really have any complaints but one. It does cause them to have far more bowel movements than before and I attribute that to the high protein content in the food and it being new and their little bellies having to get used to it. My complaint is Omg when they go the smell is AWFUL!! I'm just wondering from any of the other people who have tried this food for their pets if maybe some of the other flavors are not quite as bad when it comes to this department. Any comments would be greatly appreciated. Thanx!!

review/summary: Approved by the Queen of my Heart, Bitty
review/text: My cat, Bitty, is 16 years old and has had canned tuna for breakfast every morning since she came to enrich my world. To be sure she got all the nutrients she needed, I would supplement the canned tuna with a dry cat food. When I discovered that most dry foods contained waste products, I started searching for one without them. The ones I found did not offer the tuna flavor she liked. Then I found this one on the Amazon website and she almost couldn't wait until I put some in her dish. Now she sleeps most of the day and has gotten a bit of flesh on her ribs. Thank you Merrick for making a food she would eat!

One if them is a very picky eater and another isn't fond of seafood, so I was worried about getting this food and it being tuna, but they both love it.

I highly recommend this to people who are trying to get away from feeding their cats common brands and trying to feed them a healthier diet.

I called the company to find out what was wrong with the mix.  I was told to add 3 table spoons of flour.  I did on the next box. Well that was the problem.  The sweet mix has such a high moisture in the mix.  It need that extra flour.  Plus the bread came out nice and sweet and soft.  I also baked it on light bread not Med.

review/text: I am buying this at Amazon because I cannot find it at my local WalMart any longer and am tired of chasing around for it.  This is really great bread.  Whenever they say Hawaiian Sweet Bread I always smile, because the Hawaiians "stole" this from the Portuguese when the Portuguese immigrated to Hawaii (same with the ukelele).  Anyway, this bread is pretty close to the original.  I always add a couple drops of yellow food coloring and a tablespoon more of sugar to this to make it come even closer.  You can't go wrong with this bread mix with or without my additions.

review/summary: Great taste - needs some work to make right
review/text: I would give this five stars based on taste alone but I agree with some of the other reviews that the mix and directions out of the box need some tweaking to make it right.  I am in Denver, so altitude can play into it (although the box says it won't) and I find that I need to hold out a few tablespoons of water or add a bit of extra flour to get the right "look" to the bread ball.  I also hold out a quarter teaspoon of yeast for proper rise.  I have made two of the 12 boxes so far, using my Oster Expressbake bread machine, but hope to get to the point where I can set it up and forget about it and have great tasting, warm, bread for breakfast.  I would also like to get a shipment of 3 or 6 boxes instead of 12, but since the expiration is more than a year out, it is a minor complaint (considering the free Amazon Prime shipping that is ;-)

review/summary: DIABETIC: This is THE ONE + TIPS
review/text: Having been diagnosed a Type II Diabetic, real sugar is out of the question for me anymore; so, the hunt began. And, like most other Diabetics, I've tried 'em all... every sugar substitute on the market.<br /><br />DiabetiSweet is THE ONE. It Tastes just like sugar. Leaves No Aftertaste, just like sugar. Cooks and Bakes, just like sugar. And Measures spoon-for-spoon, cup-for-cup, just like sugar.<br /><br />I use it, sparingly, in my coffee and tea, and on my cereal.<br /><br />I use it to make cookies, candy, and ice cream.<br /><br />I use it to make cake, cobblers, pies, and coffeecake.<br /><br />I use it to make rice pudding, jello, chocolate mousse, and cr&egrave;me brulee (baked custard with the broiled, or torched, sugar on top... substituting DiabetiSweet of course).<br /><br />I've put it in my food processor, pulsing it a few times, to get it more finely grained like Superfine Sugar (what is commonly called 'Baker's Sugar').<br /><br />I use it for all the things we know and love that are designated: Sinfully Sweet. And you would not know you're eating something sugar-free.<br /><br />I gave DiabetiSweet FOUR (4) STARS for the simple reason that, if you eat too much of it, you WILL get gas; and I mean hard, rumbling, can't-hold-it-in-at-all gas. Get ready to be hugely embarrassed if you're in public.<br /><br />If you go over the gas limit, you'll then find yourself living in the bathroom for the next 3 hours. Imodium becomes your new best friend.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is the downside of DiabetiSweet. It just runs right thru you. So, you have to play with it to see what your limits are.<br /><br />In my particular case, it goes like this: 2 small scoops of ice cream, I'm fine. 3 scoops, I've got gas. 4 scoops and I've become one with my toilet, *lol*<br /><br />I will not give up my DiabetiSweet because of the possibility of these nuisances. I've just learned what my body can handle, and what it can't.<br /><br />Which, if looked at from another perspective, is a good thing; for no one has any business eating 4 scoops of ice cream, a 1/2 dozen cookies, or more than 1 slice of cake, cobbler, or pie.<br /><br />Just like real sugar's harmful effects (obesity, hypo-hyperglycemia, empty calories, etc etc), DiabetiSweet should be used very judiciously. It is, after all, a 'treat' not a 'staple'.<br /><br />Enjoy.

Having seen this item recently I decided to take a chance and order one even though I was skeptical about it and to see if it would in fact expedite the peeling and deveining process. I recieved it two days after placing the order but, it was about two or three weeks later before I got to use it. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised after the first dozen or so shrimp. If you peel a lot of shrimp this gadget might be something you should consider having. It's something I definitely recommend.

review/summary: ONLY wet food my 15 yr old cat will consistently eat
review/text: My old cat is inconsistent about recognizing her need to eat and drink, and the vet says she may have onset of feline dementia.  Like 90+ yr old people, sweet old girl sometimes just 'forgets' to nourish/hydrate herself. I concentrate on giving her high quality-no grain or other filler--wet food.  While she thrived on premium dry cat foods when younger, I've fed her almost exclusively wet food the past 3 yrs. After much experimentation, the one she will eat more than 3 days in a row is the Elegent Medleys shredded fare.  She prefers shredded to the pate texture, and since she does seem to prefer it, I think Elegant Medleys is the particular brand we must stick to.<br /><br />After an incident earlier this year when she became so dehydrated she required a day at the vet's for sub-q fluids, I am now rigorously monitoring her fluid intake.  Every morning I note the amount I replenish in her water fountain to make sure she's taking in adequate fluids.  On a really good day, she will drink around 12-14 oz water + eat two cans of Elegent Medleys shredded fare.  With that intake, she's in tip top shape, relatively speaking :-).  Under 8oz H2O and down to 1 can of food/day, she's on the road to dehydration.  BOTTOM LINE?  Old cats need wet food because (due to decreased appetite & cognitive function) they tend to not drink enough water. My experience is that around 10 yrs of age, and certainly by 12, we need to supplement dry food with wet, and by old-old age, they likely need an all-wet canned food diet of the highest quality affordable.  Read those labels!  (and I think a clean, well-maintained fountain is just about mandatory for all our sweet kitties--just sayin'.)

review/summary: Broken candy
review/text: I tried to cancel shortly after ordering this product to find that it had already shipped.  After receiving it the packaging was simply a plain manilla envelope and a box, no lining, no bubble packing.  One pop was completely broken off of the stick, there are several others with chips and chunks broken off floating around loosely in the individual package.  If I use them they will have to be opened and removed from the individual package.  I am not happy with any aspect of this order.  I won't be ordering again.  I paid for 12 expecting to use 12, unfortunately that won't be the case.

review/summary: Buyer beware
review/text: It's okay tasting crab meat, but understand that it's not a 13 oz can of meat.  It's an 8 oz can of meat with 5 oz of water in it to make your 13 oz. Do a zoom and look at the label.  Big difference.  That works out to 38.5% water you're buying.  Most of the other brands are 6 oz cans with 4.25 oz meat and 1.75 oz water making those 29% water, making the Crown Prince can roughly 1/3 more water than most other brands.  It's not misstated, so no reduction in stars for dishonesty or anything.  I just think that any product that is comprised of nearly 40% water and advertised as 13 oz is not as good a deal as they are attempting to portray.<br /><br />I didn't look at the zoom pic dry weight before buying.  I've bought it here locally by the dry pound and water weight is extra.  So I was thinking I could fudge a bit on my recipe that calls for one pound of meat (yeah, I know it's cheating), throw in a slight extra bit of filler, and save a few bucks.  Unfortunately for me, it goes the other way because I have to use two cans to get that pound.  Live and learn.<br /><br />Factor that in when you are comparing prices.

review/text: If you like to whip up appetizers that the whole gang will agree on, then use crab.  Crown Prince makes it easy (not cheap) to do with these cans of rich, lump crab meat for you.  Keep some on hand and a few fave recipes and you will almost always have good stuff to throw together and enjoy with crackers on any occasion.  Be mindful of course, that a number of folks are allergic to shellfish so always ask ahead of time.

review/summary: Great water! ripoff price from seller
review/text: I was in a gas station a couple miles from my house and saw this water in the cooler case.  I thought I should try it as I heard about alkaline water being good for me.  The gas station price was 2 (33.8 oz bottles) for $3.00. IT WAS DELICIOUS!  I normally hate drinking water.  Tap water tastes wrong to me and bottled water always tastes soapy or plastic to me.  This REAL alkaline water tasted like NOTHING!  It was the first time I experienced real tasteless refreshment.  Within an hour I had drank an entire bottle.  I typically sip water but I practically guzzled this REAL water.  If you are like me and have a hard time drinking water, PLEASE try this brand.  It's just too easy to drink a liter. I'm certain that this is what water is supposed to taste like.  GREAT PRODUCT!

However you may want to inqire  about the expiration dates on these since that is important when buying these ,since the flavor is better in the freshest ones. However they are still good up to the expiration date. Stock up since these are seasonal and when they run out you will miss your chance to get the freshest ones and they can melt out their  liquer in the summer months.The sellers are very nice and will tell you the dates.

When I walked into the gift shop looking to satisfy my sweet tooth I saw a roll of Mon Cheri. It was the most amazing thing I have ever had I just had to share with my buddies (and got sad when they was all gone). I couldn't find them anywhere so I googled them and everyone was saying that they wasn't the same and not as good. Then I found these when i got them I was very satisfied because they where just like the ones I purchased in Germany.

There's a popular saying among Chinese students studying abroad that "Lao Gan Ma (Old Auntie or something similar) is the goddess of Chinese students overseas ~". Funny but true!!! When we are not used to other non-Chinese food yet, we totally miss the taste! With this chili sauce, it's like being at home again.

There chili oil, bean and chili flakes (doesn't taste like there's any beans in it at all though), and peanuts, which work together perfectly. The spice level is also great- not the lasting habanero style burn, but more of a warm smooth heat, comparable to milder Siracha.

I am AAF with 3c/4b hair that has been thinning since the birth of my child. I have been natural for 4 years and mostly keep my hair in cornrows because of this dry, hot weather. I do "baby" my hair. Weekly conditioning, bi-weekly deep condition, satin scarves etc etc. I used this oil for my weekly conditioning. I put this on my dry hair, let it sit for a few hours (after dinner). I washed it out with apple cider vinegar and applied some shea butter and went to bed. When I wokeup I had a new head of curls!! Perfect little corkscrew curls and they were so moist. I have also been using it on my ends when I were my ponytails (between braiding). I have only been using this oil about two weeks but it really has made a difference in my curl definition and the moisture content of my hair. I highly recommend this proudcts to my natural girls!! It does have a smell to it but it disappears throughout the day. Be sure to rinse it out well.

review/summary: Cheap ingredients in an expensive bottle
review/text: This oil was something else a decade or so ago. It was also pricier. When I recently bought it at a local Indian grocer, I was surprised the price had dropped significantly. Hair oils in India are traditionally coconut oil mixed with other essential herbs, extracts etc - which is what I assumed Dabur's would be too. What a disappointment to find this only but an unhelpful formula of 1. Canola oil 2. Paraffinum Liquidum (a fancy name for Mineral oil) 3. Palm Glycerides (Solids as byproducts from hydrogenating Palm oil)...search the internet for contra-indications for these and it should steer you far away...Goes to show, bigger brands are not necessarily better (DABUR is huge in India)Unfortunately my purchase was not from Amazon and I ended up tossing it - so no refund.<br /><br />I would highly recommend pure coconut oil: you can use essential oils to add to its perfume, but sometimes I even use Azulene oil on my scalp. Works like a charm for oily, greasy scalp days...<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Easy-clean-easy-Azulene/dp/B00011JN56/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1291331352&sr=8-1

I use it as a part of deep conditioning regimen and let me say when I complete the overall process of conditioning, shampooing, and combing or brushing through my hair I have very little breakage.  If I don't use it as a part of my DC regimen than, I'll use some to a cheap conditioner as a prepoo to soften my hair for about 35 mins.  True the smell isn't the best but for the work it has done on my hair it gets my respect.  I will warn you the first ingredient used in this oil is mineral oil, so for my natural ladies who are scared of that, you may want to try the powder form.

review/text: I was using Dabur Amla Hair oil for many years and realized that it is mineral oil (Paraffinum Liquidum) and it is petroleum product and NOT a organic oil. It has Zero percent<br />(0 %) hair penetration. I have started using and trying different oils including coconut oil, and Til (Sesame) oil. I loved both - Coconut and Til oil from different company including any local Ayurvedic company in/from India which has herbs into it.<br /><br />Coconut and Til oil has more than 90% hair penetration after overnight use and I am telling this after I searched and reviewed some studies done on hair products, especially, oil. Dabur do have other hair oils product (e.g. Vatika) which has coconut oil and so if you pleased then can use that. But local Ayurvedic are far better than big brand for hair oil.<br /><br />Hope that help you a bit. Thanks.

review/text: I only used the product Amla Oil twice at the hair salon.  My hair stylist assistant washes my hair regularly and adds a cap full of the oil along with conditioner and massages it in for a few minutes and leaves it in for 10 minutes.  After she does a light shampoo to remove the oil which is very oily. YOU MUST DO A SHAMPOO OR MAYBE TWO AFTER USE.  The assistant only does one shampoo for me.  After she blows my hair out dry, my stylist styles my hair however I want and he does not put a heat protector.  My hair is left healthy, strong, and shiny (I have thick medium length hair, permed but not damaged. My hair is pretty healthy already).  The oil does not weigh my hair down, eventhough the smell is strong it is not bad.  The first use the smell lingered in my hair for two weeks and the second time of use the scent lasted 4 days.  I will continue to use this product.

review/summary: Fantastic Oil...Great for Natural Hair
review/text: I absolutely love this oil. I applied it directly to my scalp/roots, then massaged my scalp and put a bonnet over my hair and went to sleep. I woke up the next morning and washed my hair (with a homemade shampoo using castile soap) and conditioned and my hair was so incredibly soft.<br /><br />A lot of women I've heard have complained of the smell. It smells similar to the Blue Magic hair grease to me...the blue bergamont hair dressing that people use. It has a natural, almost earthy smell to it, and the smell does tend to linger. It took a day for me to stop smelling it in my hair.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend. I am African-American, and I have natural, 3b/3c hair. I felt as if the oil has accentuated my curl pattern (not defined it anymore than usual). I have noticed that my hair is shedding a lot less, and the softness is to die for. Two thumbs up, definitely.

This product did seem to remove some of the red undertones in my hair, but didn't make it thicker or softer. This product is mainly mineral oil with dye and a bit of amla mixed in. For my hair, I prefer natural coconut oil or olive oil, so now if I wish to darken my hair I mix pure amla with either of those oils and get great results.

review/text: I can say that this oil is everything other reviews has stated.  This oil has a very strong scent, but since I love herbal smells, I like it.  It does not bother me.<br />This oil works great as a pre-poo for natural 4a type afrotextured hair.<br />The only negative is the mineral oil.  Mineral oil coats the hair shaft and prevents moisture from getting in or out.

review/summary: Just a helpful review
review/text: I just wanted to let everyone know about hair oil products Bc I use them at times.. While this product does smell, it should not be worn outside, it should only be used as a leave in treatment and as such, should be used at night and shampood out in the morning. Never leave it in all day. I have not used this particular product but "amla" is a kind of a gooseberry and that's the primary ingredient in this (this oil is an ayurvedic product). Amla is very beneficial for dandruff and dry scalp so this will help with that.  But a great hair oil I use to get my hair to be healthy and grow faster is called "Vatika" and its from the same company(its on amazon). This oil does not smell bc its a coconut oil and it also has a nice fragrance added to it, so its great. I massage it in hair at night and shampoo it out in the morning. I sometimes do it twice or three times a week. I'm not a regular User. But it really helps w hair growth and also makes it stronger. I hope this helps. Sorry about the long message though.

review/summary: Better off using Olive Oil
review/text: Dabur Amla Hair Oil 300ml<br />I do NOT recommend this product at all.  It smells AWFUL and I didn't notice any difference in the feeling or behavior of my hair after leaving it on overnight and then conditioning the next day.  I'm not even sure that it's all that authentic because the ingredients on the bottle don't list any that are compelling.<br />Since trying this item, I have switched to Extra Virgin Olive Oil from my kitchen cabinet, used the same protocol for treating my hair and have noticed a softer quality in my hair as a result.<br />Don't waste the time or money ordering this product.  Go to an Indian market and choose from more authentic products.

review/summary: Worked GREAT - White Woman w/ Blonde Hair
review/text: I just got the product yesterday. I used it last night. I have fine blonde hair with damage from regular abuse. It is also thinning a little, due to the abuse. I put it on starting at roots, massaged into scalp and then ran it through the ends. It stunk. It was not the worst smelling product, but it was not nice. I left it on all night. The smell did not keep me awake. In the morning I washed it twice with a Nexus shampoo and ran a daily conditioner through my hair really quickly. It worked GREAT! My hair feels healthier. My ends show a little less damage, but really the only cure for split ends is a trim. It also looks really shiny. I plan on using this for about an 30 minutes to an hour 3 times a week for about a month then backing off to twice a week - I really don't want my hair to darken, so I might drop down to once a week, depending on how my hair reacts. I will use this product again and would advise anyone that is dealing with brittle, damaged, fine hair to use it as well.

review/summary: Works for me
review/text: I tried this product while deployed to Iraq. Being an African-American woman, our hair needs oil. This product conditioned my hair and I immediately noticed less or no breakage. My hair is in the best condition that it has been in years. I use it nightly and leave it in since my hair is very porous. It absorbs completely. This product was also excellent as a braid spray. I put it into a spray bottle and sprayed it on my scalp between the braids. No build up. I purchased many bottles prior to me redeploying back to the US. I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: What is in this?
review/text: I used this once. It works.  My hair is stronger, slightly darker and softer.  My concern is what is in this product?  What types of chemicals or pesticides were sprayed on the herbs?  How pure is the oil?  The product does not have an herbal scent but rather a chemical smell.  What is in this?  I worry because the scalp absorbs products readily and these things end up in your bloodstream....that includes any hair dye and shampoos you use.  The ingredients are especially important here because we are supposed to leave this on overnight  thus giving the scalp a lot of exposure to some unknown ingredients.  Keep in mind that the chemicals and pesticides that were banned in the US years ago are shipped to third world nations and frequently re-imported into this country via these types of products.  I don't know what is in this and it may be great but I am concerned about the smell...it is not a natural scent.

review/summary: Use before showering on dry/frizzy hair
review/text: I have been using this product for about 3 years now. I have thick, wavy black hair (which has been dyed brown in the past), and I thought this was an okay product to use. Even though it's not perfect, I would say my hair is better when I use this product than when I don't use this product.If your hair is naturally oily and rarely gets dry, you're fortunate enough not to need oils like these. But if your hair gets dry and perhaps frizzy once you're out of the shower, you should try this hair oil.<br /><br />I use this product 2 or 3 times a week. I massage it into my hair at least half an hour before I take a shower. It smells a little, and it's really up to you whether you find it a good or bad smell, but I personally don't like it. When I'm in the shower, I use small amounts of shampoo and conditioner (which is what you're supposed to do anyway) and wash out my hair with cold water. Then I let my hair air-dry or towel-dry and apply a leave-in conditioner of a different brand. And my hair feels good afterward! It's not dry nor oily, it doesn't look frizzy, and people have told me my hair is looking healthier over time.<br /><br />I basically don't like the smell of this product. And I'm sure there are much better, albeit more expensive, hair oil brands out there. But if you need to cure your hair of dryness, you should make your shower routine more like mine.

review/summary: Healthly alternative to brown sugar
review/text: This sugar goes wonderfully with coffee. I have started using it in soy lattes instead of brown sugar.  It has a more mild sweetness than regular sugar which actually complements flavors better.  It also has a slight maple taste to it that is very enjoyable.  Even though it is a more mild taste I have been using less of it than the sugar I am replacing it with.  The texture also melts better in hot beverages.  I haven't yet tried baking with it, although I plan to soon.

review/summary: My Sugar Alternative Winner!
review/text: I have spent the last 8 months trying to eliminate sugar from my diet and one of the last holdouts was the sugar in my coffee. I had not tried stevia, and just found out about coconut sugar the other day. I got a small box of stevia and this to see which I liked better. For me and for coffee, the coconut sugar was far better. The stevia had a distinct taste that wasn't unpleasant, but was a bit too noticeable for me.<br />The coconut sugar smells a bit like brown sugar. The size of granules are a bit smaller and darker than "Sugar in the Raw". The six pack consisted of containers that you could either use a spoon with or shake out. I had a hard time shaking it out, so I will probably just use a spoon.<br />Wonderful flavor with coffee! It complements the taste and isn't too sweet.

review/summary: Beneful Dog Food is all we use
review/text: We've tried a few other brands even some of the really expensive "gourmet" dog foods.  Once we put them on Beneful, they have had healthier digestion and healthier skin and coat.  They really love the chunks and they are medium sized dogs but for small breeds you'd want to get smaller kibble size.  I love that it is in a big resealable bag so I can just scoop out what I need and then close it back up.  Both of our dogs have eaten Beneful for a couple of years and always get good reports at their vet checkups.  It costs a little more than store brand dog food but you really are getting a much higher quality product.  My pups love it so much that they've learned to carry their bowl around in their teeth until I get the point and refill the bowl so they must like it.  I will continue to buy it and recommend.  It's great dog food.

review/text: Our dog isn't a picky eater, so he didn't mind switching from his normal Purina One lamb and rice to give Beneful a try.  We've tried some other beef dog foods in the past and the end result (no pun intended) is usually a smelly gassy dog that has to go frequently.  So I wasn't sure if we'd be in for more of the same when I decided to have him give this food a try.  He's been eating it for a little over a week now and I'm very surprised that he's had no issues with it.  He's been gobbling it up so I'd say that's a pretty good indicator that he likes it.<br /><br />I do think the food bits are a bit large for him.  He's a small dog (Pug/Jack mix) and I've noticed that it seems like he has to work a little harder to chew this food compared to his regular food.

review/text: PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound<br /><br />Some dog I got too. We call him Egypt. Because in every room he leaves a pyramid. --Rodney Dangerfield  :)<br /><br />If the Dog Food is a brand I have built up a trust in, claims to be 100% complete and balanced nutrition with wholesome grains and real beef, accented with vitamin-rich vegetables, comes in an easy to carry bag with a zip lock top, into my Shopping Cart it goes!<br /><br />As I am not about to taste the food ( myself ), My dogs ( Rottweilers ) will tell me the rest:<br /><br />Opened up Beneful Original Dog Food, and let my Guys have an initial sniff. (I've learned this is very important -- if mine just sit there, they will probably not eat it).  Their eyes really lit up and you could tell they were getting excited about trying something new and different.<br /><br />The dog food does have a lot of nice colors and shapes - to stimulate their minds - , and has a very pleasant aroma.  Nothing annoying to the senses, as far as I could tell.<br /><br />They waited for the "cue" to eat, and then dove in and woofed all the Purina Beneful Original Dog Food down, then hunted around the bowl for any possible spilled nuggets.  I knew it was a hit when they sat up and begged for more. Bravo!  *claps hands*<br /><br />Guess they love it, and Purina is a brand I can trust! 'nuf said!<br /><br />When feeding time is over, there is a large zip lock sort of thing that actually works, to help seal the bag -- keeping the flavor in, the Beneful Original Dog Food fresher and my Guys out of the feed bag. :)<br /><br />Does this sound like what you may be looking for in a dog food? :) I'm off to buy more Purina Beneful Original Dog Food, as this 15 pound bag will not last long, if ya know what I mean!

review/summary: It is better than most but not as good as some
review/text: When I was in my early 20's I bought the least expensive dog food that had a brand name that I recognized.  I didn't want to buy something that would harm my dogs and I figured that if it had a top name it couldn't be too bad.<br /><br />As I became older and understood more about nutrition for myself and my family I started to apply that knowledge to my choice of food for my dogs.  I continued to stick with the name brands, I just bought their more expensive lines.  One of the foods that I tried was Purina's Beneful.<br /><br />My dogs have always liked it okay, but as I tried more organic and natural lines I found that the dogs not only liked it but it seemed to improve their health.  Their coat was shinier and their pooh seemed, well... better, nicer, less stinky.  Still, Beneful is nice as a backup or just for something different every now and then.  However, I would rather spend more for a dog food that has what I perceive to have better quality ingredients.

review/summary: Your Dog Will Love This
review/text: I gave this to our dog after he had already eaten a bowl of the other stuff. He loved this. In fact, he gobbled down the entire bowl, and that was after he had already had his breakfast bowl for the day.<br /><br />I can't think of anything not to love about this dog food. It must have a terrific taste because our dog liked it, and he's a somewhat picky eater.<br /><br />The nutrition is balanced, and I believe that the combination of ingredients will keep your dog healthy. It has the right balance of protein and grain. It's a softer dog food, so you may want to consider mixing it with a crunchier dog food.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent choice for your dog.

review/summary: Dog food your vet would approve
review/text: The first thing that comes to mind is that the name of this new Purina product, "Beneful" is absolutely appropriate.  It is dog food appropriate for all ages.  Only the size and age of your dog will determine how much you need to put in the bowl.  Bag itself is very economical.  It is bagged with quick zip that helps keep food fresh.  No need to empty your 15.5 lb bag into container in order to keep the food fresh.  In addition to beef, this dog food mix contains eggs, minerals,(calcium and iron), vitamins A and E and selenium that will help your puppy'sd immune system.  What really suprises me about this food is that is has lots of vegetables: spinach, corn and peas in addition to grains - oats.<br /><br />My friend's dog is currently on a bean diet (recommended by veterinarian, so he can loose weight.  Dog was deligthed with this food.  His proportions are measured carefully and it seems that veggies and oats give him sense of fullness.  He definitely does not overeat and he seems to be very happy with his menu right now.  I must say it is delight to watch that little animal eat and be so happy afterwards.<br /><br />This is balanced nutrition.  The entire package amounts for 25% of protein, 10% of fat, 4% of fiber and 14% of moisture.  It is balanced diet food for your pet.  Give it a try!

review/summary: Average sized bits that the dogs just loved
review/text: The reviews about Beneful dry dog food formula generally are negative, focusing on ingredients & animal health. There are also a number of negative side effects reported. You can find this information if you have google-fu. That said, I am not a nutritionist or a scientist or a veterinarian, and I won't pretend to be & won't comment on those aspects. However, I can comment on how the dogs reacted to this food.<br /><br />They LOVED it! There were no food allergies or reactions as others have reported. The food bits were about the same size as other food products on the market, so this formula might not be ideal for smaller dogs.

review/summary: Beneful definitely passed the dog taste-test in this house!
review/text: If there is such a thing as a dog taste-test, Purina's Beneful has definitely passed it in this house.  My larger dog, who is part hound, could smell the nuggets right through the Amazon box and bag.  Yes, both of my dogs will eat almost anything, but certain flavors get them more excited.  They barked and continued to beg for little treats.  Indeed, my Brandy has her head lying right next to the bag waiting for a bit more.<br /><br />One thing I especially liked was the QuickZip feature that will enable this food to stay fresh.  I often wonder how any dog food can taste good after staying out in an opened bag for such a long time.  This food is conveniently sealed, but if you are thinking of a container, you might wish to consider the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00186RTWW">IRIS Airtight Pet Food Storage Container</a>, which comes in an assortment of sizes to suit your needs.<br /><br />Do I like Purina products?  I definitely do as I have one of my dogs on another of theirs.  No dog food is perfect, nor will it suit the needs of every household.  You have to decide for yourself if Beneful meets those needs and the needs of your animal.  I'll just lay out a few things about this food, including serving sizes, so you can tentatively judge if this Beneful might be a food you'd consider.  I have two dogs, each with different needs to think about.  This info is straight-from-Purina ... the taste-test was from my dogs, who love it.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, water, meat and bone meal, propylene glycol, sugar, tricalcium phosphate, phosphoric acid, salt, animal digest, potassium chloride, sorbic acid (a preservative), dried peas, dried carrots, calcium propionate (a preservative), choline chloride, l-Lysine monohydrochloride, Vitamin E supplement, zinc sulfate, red 40, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate, niacin, yellow 6, yellow 5, Vitamin A supplement, blue 2, calcium carbonate, copper sulfate, Vitamin B-12 supplement, brewers dried yeast, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin D-3 supplement, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), calcium iodate, folic acid, biotin, sodium selenite.<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Calorie Content (Metabolizable Energy, ME)<br /><br />3689kcal/kg  1674kcal/lb  360kcal/cup<br /><br />25.0% Crude Protein (Min)<br />10.0%  Crude Fat (Min)<br />4.0% Crude Fiber (Max)<br />14.0% Moisture (Max)<br />1.4%  Linoleic Acid (Min)<br />1.1%  Calcium<br />175 mg/kg Iron (Fe) (Min)<br />0.2 mg/kg  Selenium (Se) (Min)<br />10,000 lU/kg  Vitamin A (Min)<br />100lU/kg Vitamin E (Min)<br /><br />FEEDING:<br /><br />Adult Dogs<br /><br />3 lbs to 28 lbs -  1/2 to 1-1/4 cups<br /><br />28 lbs to 52 lbs - 1-2/3 to 2-1/2 cups<br /><br />52 lbs to 76 lbs - 3-1/4 to 4 cups<br /><br />76 lbs to 101 lbs - 4 to 5 cups<br /><br />100+ lbs - 5 cups plus 1/3 cup for each 10 lbs of body weight over 100 lbs<br /><br />Do I recommend it?  I can only say for my dogs, but they do love it and are patiently waiting for me to undo that QuickZip for another taste!

review/summary: My dog doesn't love it
review/text: It is really hard to rate dog food because I am not the one eating it.<br />My dog is used to Purina One...  lamb or chicken.<br />Beneful is much more colorful.  It doesn't have a particular odor.  It is softer than the food I am used to.  My mixed terrier has been slow to take to this.  This may say more about my dog than the Beneful...  He loves treats and I was sure he would see this as a treat with all the shapes and colors (ok...dogs are color blind but)<br /><br />I think dogs are slow to change what they are used to so I wouldn't take this as meaning your dog won't like Beneful.  Nutritionally, it looks like it is good but I can't tell how much of that is marketing.<br /><br />I'll revise if our dog seems to acclimate more to this.

review/summary: My dog enjoys it
review/text: Puriina Beneful Original is a generalized food: you can give it to dogs of all ages, sizes, and breeds.  Adult dogs, puppies, weaning puppies, this food will work equally well. In fact, the bag even contains directions on "feeding for reproduction." With that in mind, you're not going to get some ultra-fancy kibble designed for one specific function, but this seems like a good-quality food nonetheless.<br /><br />The bag describes a "variety of crunchy and moist pieces." There are six different pieces, presumably with different flavors. It's a very colorful food, but I don't think the moistness/crunchiness varies much. Rather, it seems to have a consistency comparable to most other dry dog food.<br /><br />It's a nice food, and I should add that I do like the convenient zip-top they put on the bag. My dog seems to enjoy it quite a bit, and I suppose that's what really counts
