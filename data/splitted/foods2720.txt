review/summary: Great concentrated flavor, lovely bottle to display
review/text: We LOVE this watermelon Amoretti syrup. We mostly use it with carbonated water for a nice seltzer or Italian Soda, but it is also really delicious in Lemonade. We also love the beautiful bottles this comes in. They are great for displaying right on the counter. And they already come with a pump top, so you don't have to buy one separately, which is really nice. The Amoretti syrup is more concentrated than other brands we have tried, so you don't have to use much to get good flavor. And we can enjoy a nice soda without any High fructose corn syrup and less calories than regular soda. Good stuff!

review/summary: Robitussin Sodas, anyone?
review/text: Let me start out by saying how sad I am to give this product a negative review.  I love watermelon EVERYTHING, so I was super excited when I saw this new syrup was available.  I have to say, however, that it blows my mind how the guys in Amoretti R&D actually thought this syrup tasted like anything but watermelon cough syrup.  For use in Italian sodas, this is *completely* undrinkable.  I've confirmed this with a few friends to make sure I wasn't just being a bitch.  Others reviewers here have mentioned using this syrup in yogurt, and I did try a couple pumps in a strawberry smoothie, and the dairy did seem to help cover up the poison/medicinal overtones.<br />  In short, I cannot recommend this flavor.  If you're looking for a good watermelon syrup, try the Torani version.  I'm sure Amoretti has some excellent flavors in their arsenal, but this is definitely NOT one of them.

review/summary: whoo-hoo !!!
review/text: Mariani makes some pretty terrific, delicious dried fruit. If you like pineapple, mango, papaya--or all of the above--then this great snack is for you! The small plastic bag comes well sealed for you to take it on the road with you when you're traveling and want a quick energy boost; and the contents remain fresh until the expiration date printed on the package.<br /><br />The dried fruit has no fat nor does it have cholesterol. The sodium content is low but you do have to watch out for the sugar--30 grams of it per serving, and there are four servings in this tiny six ounce package. If sugar is a health concern for you I would avoid eating this snack.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is fantastically tasty and very pleasant. There is also a slight "sweet and sour" effect from the rather sweet pineapple and the tangy mango dried bits of fruit. The papaya is also very sweet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this fine dried fruit to anyone who wants a snack food or something they can eat fast when they're on the run and they just want a little energy sugar boost. It's also nice to serve to guests as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: Great tasting fruit snack. As others have commented, it is somewhat on the sweet side, but it is still better than corn syrup and hydrogenated oil filled candy bars. Sweet and sour (lime juice on papaya is genius!) for a good kick and fine texture. Perfect companion to a shot of espresso (I know, thought coffee and fruit is weird until I tried). Amazon price seems on the high side, local grocery store has it cheaper.

review/text: I ordered this product because the description says it is coconut powder.  This is not a powder at all.  It is finely shredded coconut which will be great for smoothies and baking.  However, I am looking for powder as a milk substitute, or to added to my coffee since I am lactose intolerant.  I was very disappointed because I now have 5 pounds of not "coconut powder." I am not disappointed with the taste of this coconut powder, it is just that I cannot use it as a powder.  Maybe I am missing as how to use this finely shredded coconut as a milk substitute powder.  Any suggestions?

We came up with a mixture of quotes on love and marriage, interspersed with random silliness...a perfect blend for this couple. The design was handled with artistic and creative genius. I received the cookies yesterday and they are fresh and very tasty...nothing like the stale restaurant stuff. I can't praise Greenfire enough. Worth every penny.

We had a great response and the children had fun with promoting the musical in such a unique and tasty way!  I highly recommend Greenfire for the wonderful service and great product.

A representative of Greenfire and I worked together and came up with 60 different Olympics-related fortunes and I ordered three pounds of them. My staff loved them. I brought them to a meeting at the start of the day, and we spent almost as much time reading the fortunes to each other as we spent working. After the meeting, I left them out for the staff go nibble away at, and by the end of the night, all three pounds were gone. I got a kick out of hearing my staff laughing at the fortunes we came up with. Two successful rounds of fortunes, and I plan on being back for a third round.

review/summary: Consistently Good Tea
review/text: I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed envelope which helps to keep it fresh.  Over a period of time, I have settled on two favorites.  These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F95C">Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>: At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS">Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas.

A 'Scoville Unit' is actually a measure of capsaicin (the chemical in hot peppers that is responsible for their heat).<br /><br />Scoville's test was a comparative taste test that is considered subjective by today's standards. A more sophisticated method is in use today, but in honor of Wilbur Scoville, the unit of measure is still called the Scoville.<br /><br />The capsaicin level in peppers can vary from plant to plant due to local environmental conditions. This means that a pepper's rating is an average measure.<br /><br />The hottest pepper on record is the Bhut Jolokia with a pungency of over 1 million Scoville Heat Units (1,001,304, to be exact). By contrast, the Bell Pepper comes in at less than 100 Scoville Heat Units."

review/summary: Good idea - Bad execution
review/text: I love almost all Tabasco products and living in Louisiana, I can buy them local.  However, this specialty hot sauce was not done right.  Unfortunately, the first ingredient of this stuff is high-fructose corn syrup.  Notwithstanding taste, it pours thicker than any sauce I've ever seen that it looks "gummy" almost.  For a Louisiana company, you'd think they would support their local sugar farmers and at least use a sugar syrup instead.  I'd stay away from any product with high-fructose corn syrup, and this is one of them.

review/summary: I burn through this stuff way too quickly!
review/text: I received a Tabasco caddy of six flavors and this was one of them. Its flavor is not that memorable against the typical Asian chili sauce market. There are a lot of sauces out there with the same look, consistency and flavor. This has a spicier kick as the name implies which is good but for its size I go through it way too quickly for the price/shipping. Tabasco red has a specific flavor and its size compliments the price and portion you use. This flavor can be found elsewhere, in greater sizes, for the same price if not less. Besides that, it's good and I like it.

I don't know what it in it, but I threw the whole bunch away after trying 3.  I kept thinking that maybe it was just my taste that day, but it seemed to get worse with each one.<br /><br />I claims to have cashews, pecans, and tree nuts, whatever they are, but they are undectable.The taste was not pleasant and trying to swallow the dry mess was difficult.  I am really amazed by all of the excellent comments about this bar!  I didn't think that I was THAT different from the normal run of people, but unless I just got a bad batch, I guess that I am.  It was just a waste of money.

review/summary: Disappointing - too many hard hull pieces
review/text: After reading the other reviews, I was so anxious to try this popcorn.  I've been trying every popcorn available on Amazon.  The Amish brand (non-Wabash Valley) are good, but small.  The Fireworks Orchard blossom is also very good, but also somewhat small.  Therefore, to see a "large" popcorn advertised was exciting.<br />  However, the popcorn didn't pop any bigger than cheap store-bought popcorn, but had ten times as many hulls!  The broken hulls are large, hard and curled.  Few kernals didn't have open hulls still attached, and trying to break off the hull destroyed the fluffy part.  There were more hull pieces than popped kernals.  The few white/yellow parts are also sort of rubbery/chewy and have no flavor.<br />  Terribly expensive.  It would be worth it if the popcorn were half-way decent, but it isn't.  If you don't pick out the hulls, your mouth is full of them and they are stuck between your teeth and caught in your throat.<br />I always pop in a frying pan on the stove top for best results.  This was popped the same way as all the other brands.  I will try it one more time, hoping for different results and will update this if the next batch is better.

My machine also pops pretty much everyone one of the seeds for the most part.<br /><br />Also don't get confused at first like I did.  It's not Caramel flavored popcorn or anything like that.  I believe they are just talking about the type of kernel.  This pops like normal yellow popcorn and has no seasonings or added flavor.  So if you want big normal yellow popcorn, than this is right for you.

On a side note, this popper is the best! We have popped many batches of this popcorn and are amazed at the quality and size of the popcorn! It is tender and has a great taste. Very few if any leftover kernals. That is a plus! And it pops as big as the kettle corn you buy at fairs and markets! The order gives you a lot of popcorn. I have vacuumed packed some of the bags with my Food Saver sealer. I gave a bag to my daughter and she also loved it. The best!

review/text: So, I just got this Carmel type popcorn in and yes, it is hardy enough for Carmel and heavy drizzles.  I wanted this because I love popcorn! And I really like bigger corn puffs.  I was using jolly time white and it was small kernels.  I use an air popper and the jolly time was so small that before any would pop about 10 to 20 kernels would get blown out of the popper.<br /><br />I just popped up a batch and only one kernel flew out before the popping started!  I put topping oil on it and sprinkled kettle corn seasoning on it.....YUM!  So I am very satisfied with results.<br /><br />I love Amazon's subscribe and save on this product too, because now I will have this popcorn coming automatically every 5 months! Free shipping and a discounted price make my love of popcorn easy to acquire.

review/summary: GLUTEN FREE!  So good, I had to review it!
review/text: BOTTOM LINE:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  This stuff was sooo good, I really wish I had another bowl right now. The Quantity:Price ratio takes the product down one star.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I thought the flavor was excellent, in that I could really taste the garlic, pepper, and onions.  The broth was a little salty at first, but I added a bit more water to get it to where I wanted.  I also thought it could use a little spiciness, but I feel that way about everything (I left out their oil packet and added a squirt of my own Hot Chili Sesame Oil - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZXXWM">House of Tsang Hot Chili Sesame Oil</a> and it was perfect).  It was really nice in that it had more than just your standard chicken/ msg broth flavor - it had real subtle flavor notes.<br /><br />NOODLES:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  I thought I would note that I really like the noodles in this - they are not your standard Ramen noodle, but are a form of rice noodle, similar to Vietnamese Pho.  These take a little longer to cook, but are definitely a great match for the broth.  I bought them because they are gluten free, but they make a great soup noodle in their own right.<br /><br />QUANTITY vs. PRICE:<br />I wish there was more in the bowl than what was provided.  This is what takes the product from 5 stars down to 4.  For the price, I wish there was more food - or for the amount of food, I wish it was cheaper.  To be fair, I bought this at my supermarket, and not on here, but the price is similar.

review/summary: Pleasant, clean flavor that complements Italian food perfectly
review/text: I love Italian food and wine.  Initially I purchased the Trapani Sea Salt on a whim.  After I completely embraced the pairing of regional Italian wines with the corresponding dishes moving to Italian sea salt seemed only natural.<br /><br />We have many different flavors of salt in our home.  I routinely cook with the following:<br /><br />1. Sicilian Trapani Sea Salt<br /><br />2. Hawaiian Red Salt<br /><br />3. French Grey Salt<br /><br />4. Celtic Salt<br /><br />5. Scandinavian Smoked Salt<br /><br />6. Kosher Salt<br /><br />A few years ago I would have thought anyone nuts if they told me they used six different types of salt.  Now I search for new types of sea salt with the same enthusiasm that used to be reserved for hunting for new Italian wines.  The next two salts on my list are Peruvian Pink and Oak Smoked Chardonnay.<br /><br />I have been struggling with how to describe the difference in taste.  Sadly, I have not figured out how to describe it other than to say it tastes like Italy.  What makes different salts taste different is the different mineral content within the crystal.  They all taste similar, but different.  It is like the difference between a Chianti from two different wineries.<br /><br />Can I really taste the difference in all these different salts?  No doubt about it, but isn't just me that can taste the difference.  The other members of my family that once thought this a ridiculous practice can also taste the difference.  If you love Italian food and wine, try the Sicilian Trapani Sea Salt.  We enjoy it at our house.

HARD AS A ROCK. No point in trying to exchange for what they actually advertise THIS IS ALL THEY SEND. DISAPPOINTING.

review/text: My family loves them.  Two Yorkies and a Chihuahua are enjoying the Stix for the first time today.<br />I snapped them in half because they are long enough for two servings and I don't want my wee ones to get pudgy.<br />They are very similar in size and texture to Thinkers Duck Treats.  But I wish they had the vitamins and DHA for brain function like Thinkers.<br />I will buy these again for the wee ones.

review/summary: A great alternative to traditional oatmeal!
review/text: I bought this on a whim, hoping it would be different from traditional oatmeal.  I am happy to say that this product is wonderful!  I can not eat regular oatmeal because to me it is gooey, sticky and just gross.  But this Oat Bran is great.  No gooey texture, very easy to prepare and very healthy.  I pour some in a bowl, add milk and microwave for about a minute and half.  Add a little bit of brown sugar and some dried cranberries and it makes for a great, filling breakfast.  I am so glad I took a chance on this product and I will definitely buy more again.

review/summary: The Greatest Oatmeal. Nuff Said!!!
review/text: I usually do not write reviews (I just felt I should this time for this great product) and I am by no means an oatmeal connoisseur. My wife makes oatmeal and I eat it. She had made many different brands of oatmeal and as far as oatmeal goes this stuff is pure bliss in my mouth. No other oatmeal compares. I agree with all the great reviews for this product. Now the problem is I can no longer eat the other ho-hum normal oatmeal in the round can. My 14mo. old son loves this oatmeal too. Do not hesitate and just buy it.

review/text: For 2 servings, boil 2 cups water (with salt if you like) and add 2/3rds cup oat cereal. It's very runny at first as you're preparing it, and you may wonder, how on earth does this become into a perfect 5* cereal....but then it magically thickens....oh my! I add butter, honey and if I am feeling particularly naughty, cream instead of milk. My husband who is not a healthy food eater by any stretch of the imagination, loves this stuff... we have just received our 3rd box of 4 cereals on subscription. It's much cheaper on Amazon than our local "health food" store.

review/text: Insanely delicious.  I had never tried hot oat bran cereal before and wasn't sure I would like it.  The cooking instructions (2 c. water, 2/3 dry cereal) are for two generous servings.  I did not realize this but happily consumed a bowl and a half, sweetened with 1 Tbs. organic Rice Syrup.  Ahh, bliss and good for you too.  Only takes two minutes to prepare.  This is my kind of "comfort" food and hit the spot with all its natural flavor.  No way will I ever buy junk they call cereal in regular stores.  Super fast free delivery!  Thanks Amazon.

I put some cereal and hot water from the coffee machine in a big coffee mug with lid, mix well, cover, and let it sit for 5 minutes.  At this point I add some Craisins, mix again, cover, and let it sit until it cools down (another 5 minutes). I like the flavor, and the fact that it has no added salt.  At about 2.50 per bag the price is good too.

review/text: First of all, I've never tasted any Oat Bran prior to ordering Bob's Red Mill Oat Bran.  Upon receipt I made one serving to test it out.  I added some stevia sweetener and a little milk and butter.  I ended up making 2 more servings and gobbled those down too!  After a few days went by, I laid off the butter and milk and now eat it with mainly just a little stevia.  I can eat this anytime of the day and I've had it for dinner too!  It taste delicious for a hot cereal and very filling.  I went through one bag in 4 days :)  But, now I'm down to eating it only for breakfast.  I guess it so easy to make it has been my go to meal when I get hungry and want something that is wholesome.  I definitely recommend this oat bran if you're trying to get more fiber in your diet and want something that is D-licious.

A component of that diet is daily oat bran.<br /><br />We've tried a couple of different brands, but we like Bob's Red Mill the best. Both the flavor and texture are superior, and I like that it's organic. I also like the company - having seen them profiled in the news. They treat their employees well and even basically gave partial ownership to their workers.<br /><br />For use with the Dukan diet, I find the easiest  and tastiest way to prepare is to put two tablespoons in a bowl, pour in just enough skim milk to cover, then microwave for about 60 seconds. I add in organic cinnamon (cinnamon is good for blood sugar).

review/text: This is an excellent midnight Hot Cereal for 24 hr wheelchair racers who need that extra brain in their diet.  It's very healthy, keeps you on your stumps and even is good for the tongue or back bone.<br /><br />But don't make it too hot or you'll burn your fingers if you don't have a fork or straw.  It builds muscle tone, eye cordination, keeps calcium levels in check and improves overall digestive systems and opens clogged gas tracts.<br /><br />You can use any type of milk to prep it, but I prefer warm camel milk.  You can even eat it raw if you have no stove, old newspapers, stick logs, or propane tank nearby.

review/text: I use oat bran both as a hot cereal and in baking. Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Cereal is delicious as a hot cereal (especially when cooked in milk rather than water) and ordering it online from Amazon is cheaper than buying Quaker Oat Bran in my local supermarket (if I buy it with enough other stuff in my order to qualify for Super Saver Shipping). However, if you are using it for baking you should be aware that it is not as finely ground as Quaker's. Sometimes this has an effect on the texture of your baked goods and sometimes it doesn't. It depends on the recipe. I definitely prefer it to Quaker's as a hot cereal because it has more texture.

I eat mine raw, with kefir, so you could use it for instance in yogurt, straight from the bag. This means less processing, so you wont increase its glycemic index by breaking down carbs through high temperatures, and you will preserve all of its nutrients.<br /><br />The price is good, with the subscribe and save it is cheaper than I could find in any local store.

As with any plain-old grain cereal, the base is pretty bland (though, it can be eaten that way ... it's not as flavorless as some!), but is easy to work with ... add a small touch of blueberry syrup and a few fresh blueberries, or a touch of brown sugar and some maple syrup, and it's truly delightful! I will definitely buy another box when this one runs out.

review/summary: Best serendipitous mistake I ever made! Wonderful product!
review/text: I ordered this on accident. For some reason I thought I was getting Steel Cut Oats that I buy all the time. I was disappointed when I saw my mistake. AND THEN! I tried it. I absolutely, positively love this cereal! It has changed my morning routine. I put the required amount into the microwave with water-in less than 2 minutes it is done. I mix it with Almond milk(I love cow's milk, but it doesn't love me :(  ) I sweeten the mix with a dusting of stevia sweetener. You don't need very much stevia as it is very sweet. This makes a thick satisfying "shake". Easy to drink and take as you drive to work. I have also added various add-ins and it just gets better and better. I have added cherry juice concentrate/raisins/cranberries/almonds/flax seed...the list goes on and on. But no matter what I add or don't add I love the texture and the taste. It is the best mistake I ever made. Thank you to the universe for this serendipitous mistake. Oh yes, it reminds me of when I was young and my mother made us Cream of Wheat "shakes" for breakfast. I can't have wheat anymore either...so this makes me so happy to find this product!!! YAY!

review/summary: Delicious, quick, with fiber and a "comfort food" on cold days, good for "Dukan"ites...
review/text: I had pretty much removed grains from my diet to lose 120 lbs. I started adding back no-gluten carbs (a bit of rice, a bit of tubers). But when cold weather hit, I wanted something comforting and hot and "cerealy". I already had used Bob's Red Mill products and knew they were GOOD STUFF. So, I decided this didn't have such a bad carb hit per serving (14 net carbs per 1/3 cup dry)<br /><br />Really lovely. Easy to fix (cook for 2 minutes, let stand 2 minutes, done). I sweeten it with fruit or sucralose and I'm good to go. I feel like my mom is "mothering" me, making me feel very cozy. It hasn't impeded my diet so far (though I was leery of readding a cereal). I figure the anti-nutrients in the oats is worth the comfort. :D<br /><br />If you like oat bran cereal, this is a great one and the price here is good for the 4 pack. (I wish the folks who ordered it via amazon would mention the expiration date, as I have sometimes gotten foodstuffs here close to expiration, and 4 bags of this would last me quite a while...) I plan to order this 4-pack and hoping it's a fresh batch. Will update if otherwise.<br /><br />The nutritionals:<br /><br />Nutrition Facts<br />Serving Size: 1/3 cup dry (31g)<br />Servings Per Container: 16 (per 18 oz. bag)<br />  Amount<br />Per Serving  % Daily<br />Value*<br /> Total Calories  120<br />  Calories From Fat  15<br /> Total Fat  2  g  3%<br />  Saturated Fat  0  g  0%<br />  Trans Fat  0  g<br /> Cholesterol  0  mg  0%<br /> Sodium  0  mg  0%<br /> Total Carbohydrates  21  g  7%<br />  Dietary Fiber  6  g  22%<br />  Sugars  0  g<br /><br /> Protein  5  g<br /> Vitamin A  0%<br /> Vitamin C  0%<br /> Calcium  2%<br /> Iron  8%<br /><br />Thumbs up from me!<br /><br />And for folks doing that Dukan Diet, which isn't what I do,  I hear this is suitable for that.

So I ordered it, then tried the muffin recipe and...WHOA!!! Absolutely fantastic! Then I tried it as a hot cereal, adding a tbsp of the flax seed mill, a dash of salt, a few chopped walnuts, frozen blueberries and a touch of maple syrup. OMHolyGod, is this stuff tasty!!! So, I have a bowl of it for breakfast, and maybe a bowl for lunch (if I'm in a rush, I'll pack a couple of the muffins). It's so light and filling, without making you "full", and you can rest assured knowing that you're getting all the fiber you need for the day. Keeps me regular (an added bonus), and my cholesterol in check. I'm a very happy gal!!!

I'm currently reading the Dukan Diet book and see that one of the requirements for that program is to consume a tablespoon and a half of oat bran on a daily basis which sounds good to me.  He provides a little recipe for an oat bran pancake which I'll try.  I imagine that with the publication of this book in the USA, the interest in this product will skyrocket and that's a good thing.  Oat bran makes a great addition to bread doughs as well and you might even consider it in your next home made pizza.  This is much more than a hot cereal.

review/summary: Cooks very quick
review/text: It's a bit less nutrients than steel-cut oats, but on the positive side, it's exceptionally fast to cook, literally a couple of minutes; I stir it into boiling water, then add about one-square-inch-worth of torn-up orange peel, then -- bubble-bubble toil and trouble -- stir it from a few secs to maybe a minute (on high heat), then cover and turn it off, and go about my business, take a shower or something. When I'm back it's ready.<br /><br />The texture is kinda like thick glue (depending on the amount of water: unlike steel-cut oats, this seems capable of sucking in any amount of water); the taste is sufficiently different from steel-cut oats so you can alternate them on consecutive days w/o feeling you're eating the same thing. I like to add a teaspoon of butter, two-three tablespoons of sunflower seeds, one cut-up banana (combined with the orange peel tastes great), and sprinkle on a bit of either sugar or parmesan. Comes out pretty nice! I wouldn't eat it every day, but every other day is fine. And the price (ten bucks a package) is quite good too. Nothing to complain about! Five stars. And thanks to other reviewers, 'cause I bought this thing to try after reading these reviews here. They're not lying! It's good stuff.

review/summary: High quality for reasonable price
review/text: Very good quality. I put oat bran in almost everything I bake, even commercial cake mix. It's always undetectable and adds fiber and nutrition.

review/summary: I love it!
review/text: I make milkshakes using this cereal (cooked), skim milk and powdered buttermilk. It has a rich texture without the sweetness and fat of regular milkshakes.
