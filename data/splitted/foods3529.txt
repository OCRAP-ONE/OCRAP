review/text: I had a distinct aftertaste of ammonia at the back of my throat after eating one handful of these.  It was awful and I won't let my kids touch them.  I can't stand that ammonia is deemed a "natural ingredient" and some manufacturers think it is ok to use it.

review/summary: Delicious, low-fat little cookies!
review/text: I love the PB2 peanut butter powder (I make a smoothie with it every morning), so I was excited to try these. They are definitely sweet little cookies and not crackers...sort of a misleading name. Very peanut buttery and crisp - you would never guess they were reduced fat if you didn't know! The only downside is that they are so addictive. If you want to engage in portion control, you should really divide these between 7 snack-sized containers. That would be about 100 calories each portion, but make sure you only have a couple with you!

review/summary: Excellent Organic Raw Seeds!
review/text: I love these seeds, they are sprouted which increases the nutrient availability.  I think they are delicious, not over salted, but just enough to bring out the delicate flavor of the raw seeds.  The apple cider vinegar adds a bit of interest to the flavor.  Due to the sprouting they are easier to chew and not as hard as unsprouted raw pumpkin seeds.  Personally I find them addicting and much more appealing that just plain unsprouted raw organic pumpkin seeds.

review/summary: Afraid not
review/text: I really wanted to disagree with customer Wallace about this, and decided to take the plunge anyway since it was only a wee over two dollars.  The ingredients in the description are the same as on the package: Ingredients: Black tea, orange peel and flavor.  It doesn't say natural flavor, so I assume not, but don't know.  Smelling the tea inside the packet gives a very pleasant odor of black tea with a touch of grapefruit.<br /><br />Unfortunately, using a decent amount of the dried tea, the taste of the tea was like very weak black tea, very watery, and you really had to spend time trying to sense any grapefruit despite the actual grapefruit peel in it.  WAIT- it says ORANGE PEEL, not Pink Grapefruit.  Sheesh.  I just noticed that. But it doen't give you a sense of orange either.<br /><br />I was browsing Amazon's tea because I had run out of a box of really great Grapefruit Tea (bags) made in Poland and bought at my local dollar store, but the store no longer carries it.  The brand name is Babcia Jagoda, with a smiling Granny giving the OK sign.  She's right.  It has hibiscus, apple, rosehip, black currant, black chokeberry in it, but also lists "grapefruit aroma" and grapefruit juice, I assume dried.  There is no black tea in it so I assume it's all herbal, but the thing is: it does have grapefruit aroma, but most importantly, it TASTES grapefruity.  I'm going to have to search online for a new source.

I have even purchased three more boxes two days after getting the first one. They taste like the holidays, spicy and lusciously laden with almonds and crispy sugary goodness with a tiny tang of bitterness of the almond. They flavor is royal and time stopping, on busy days, one bite of this cookie and I am transfixed into magical fields of luxurious old world taste that has been popular to Italians for years.<br /><br />Incredibly aromatic crispy almond cookies that are a luscious addiction to coffee, tea or wine and are great for cooking and baking with.

review/text: These come in the famous red tin -- see my customer photo.  The current Amazon picture is incorrect -- it shows the "window-box" packaging, which is not what this item is.<br /><br />The cookies inside are the full size Amaretti Di Saronno cookies, wrapped in pairs in the crinkly parchment paper.  (These are not the small "Amarettini" cookies with the "-ini" at the end.  Those come in the "tall" tin.)<br /><br />Absolutely love these cookies. They are delicious with red wine.  We get some each year during the Holiday season. Year after year, these are delicious as ever.<br /><br />I cannot comment on whether it is still possible to light the wrappers on fire (a complaint in other reviews).  I have not tried this since I was 15 years old, which was a LONG time ago.

review/text: Many people consider these a staple to be kept in the pantry.  Not only do they make a great cookie, but you can bake with them, using the crumbled cookies for toppings, pie crusts, crumbs etc.<br /><br />I figure everyone has probably already tried these but, if you haven't, they are a classic Italian type meringue like almond cookie puff.  They are sweet but still retain a lot of the real, nutty, very slightly bitter almond qualities of real almonds.  The come wrapped in pretty little twisted paper wrappers, making it easy to throw one or two packets into your lunch bag.  They are super-light but still satisfying.  I've never met anyone of any age who disliked them, either, which is another reason they are good to keep on hand, because your guests will be happy even if these are the only cookies you have.

review/summary: Too sweet to buy without flying paper trick
review/text: Like another reviewer, I am disappointed that as of 2010, the wrappers no longer float up into the air when lit. In fact, I've written this review only because we had gotten some for a 60th birthday dinner party we hosted and were curious why they didn't work.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are light in texture, flavorful (very...H-bomb department), and crunchy. But they are so sweet your molars will explode on contact.<br /><br />To many people these are good things. But since I do not like extreme sweetness, I'm not one of them. Too bad, because the texture is very nice. Anyway, you folks who are averse to sugary stuff should stick to your favorite biscotti.<br /><br />We would serve these cookies on the side with the "main" dessert, exclusively on special occasions when we wanted to do the delightful little trick with the wrappers. Without that ability, we have no reason to buy the cookies.

review/summary: What the heck did they do to the wrappers?!?!
review/text: My family has enjoyed these cookies for more than a decade, and at our Christmas Eve dinner, we brought them out at the usual time, and started with the annual tradition of "flying angels."  For those of you not familiar with these cookies, if you wrap them in a cylinder, and light the top, when the fire reaches the base, the wrapper shoots up in the air.  It's actually quite a bit of fun.<br /><br />So imagine our surprise this year when NONE of the wrappers would fly.  We compared old wrappers and new, and SOMETHING has changed about the wrappers.  Whether it's wax, weight, or something else, none would fly for us (and we have an awful lot of people who are experienced with this).<br /><br />So, if you're a fan of these cookies, and the fun tradition that's sprung up around them, I caution you, you may not be able to enjoy them this year as you have done in the past.

review/summary: Makes one hell of a Risotto
review/text: I decided to purchase this can of rice after viewing an episode of "In Search of Perfection" in which Heston Blumenthal went OCD over developing the perfect Risotto.  Using his normal molecular gastronomic approach, he settled on this particular brand of Carnaroli rice as the basis for his perfect Risotto.<br /><br />I had a little fun showing this episode to some of my family members, whipping out this can of Carnaroli, and then making them my own notion of the perfect Risotto.  The felt like they had been given rock star treatment, and visited Italy.  In that sense it was worth it.<br /><br />I subtract 1 star because this is just about the most expensive rice that you can buy at the moment. It's even more pricey than the Rolls Royce of Rice, Spanish Bomba.  Bomba goes for about $13 per kilo.  Is this better than Bomba?  I don't think so. Does it make a better risotto than a fine Arborio rice?  I don't think so.  Is it better than a good Vialone Nano?  Again, I don't think so.  My best risottos sprang from Arborio rice.<br /><br />Ultimately, I will use this rice again, when I want to put on a show. However, it is too expensive to be my every-day, go-to rice for risotto.

review/summary: Very tasty and lower sugar alternative to Starbucks
review/text: I was looking for a product that would give me a taste similar to Starbucks' Green Tea Frappucino, but at a lower cost (made at home) and stumbled across this. I thought the idea of sugar-free made it even better, as the Starbucks' version is high in sugar and calories.<br /><br />The taste is fantastic!! After scouring the internet, for quite some time, I was able to locate some remaining stock of discontinued Torani Melon syrup (the green kind, not watermelon), and the resulting mix is very close to Starbucks' version.<br /><br />The shipping was lightning fast, even with standard delivery. I was very pleased with the entire transaction.<br /><br />In fact, my only complaint is that, if you are like me, and have a digestive system extremely sensitive to xylitol (or most artificial sweeteners ending in "-ol"), be aware that this product may have a "come-back-to-haunt-you" side effect. I won't get graphic with the specifics, but I think you can figure it out (I think the sweetener manufacturers refer to it as a "laxative effect").<br /><br />The problem is...the stuff is so tasty, I consider the side effect a mild deterrent, at worst. I'm still drinking it. However, in the future, I may go ahead and reorder the product in its "cane sugar" form, and just try not to drink it obsessively, to escape the side effect.

review/summary: Perfect
review/text: I love, love, love Matcha GT lattes from SBux, and I always get mine unsweetened, with soymilk. These can get rather pricey as a frequent afternoon pick-me-up. As soon as I opened the bag, I knew this was exactly the replacement I wanted. I can use nonfat unsweetened almond milk (SBux's is vanilla sweetened), and make it as strong or weak as I'd like.<br /><br />I am currently drinking one I made (the package literally arrived an hour ago) a few minutes ago with vanilla almondmilk, because that's all I had on hand. It tastes awesome, and I'm very pleased with my purchase.<br />Convenience is not an issue for me since my apartment complex has a SBux on the corner, but the convenience factor is still nice.<br /><br />This is a great alternative to SBux's Matcha GT Latte- healthier, more customize-able, cheaper, and more convenient.

review/summary: One of the greatest cereals ever!
review/text: These crunchy flakes have been a favorite of mine for a long time. Though I usually tend to prefer a sweeter, more unhealthy cereal to start my day, these are a good change of pace. If I get tired of Cocoa Puffs, I just whip a box of these out of the pantry and I'm set. Overall, great, plain tasting cereal, with nutrition abounding in every bite.<br /><br />Warning to potential buyers: This cereal gets very old and boring very quickly. If you're like me, you'll only eat this twice a week and stick with Lucky Charms (or something) the rest of the time.

When Amazon sells pet food and/or treats made in China they must be disclosed on the Amazon page as "MADE IN CHINA". No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China.<br />As a loyal customer, I expect Amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Amazon MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products! If Amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source, then Amazon should not sell it!<br />One Star is much too high a rating. I had to throw out all the Dogswell products I purchased, Shame on Amazon for selling without disclosing the source!

review/summary: BEWARE - MADE IN CHINA
review/text: I am so appalled at this finding as my dog has been taking these treats for 8 years, now this explains to me why my dog became so ill back in October 2011 and still no diagnosis as doctors kept pumping me for money and told me all tests were negative. I read previous reviews and had also noticed the chicken and apple treat became a quarter size with a very black chicken wrap and me like a dummy gave it to him anyway. 6 months later of my dog vomiting, bloody diarrhea extreme weight loss we started prednizone as it was the last resort, either that or they wanted to operate saying it was a thickening intestinal wall that was stopping food from passing but couldn't guarantee this would work. I so now in my heart believe is was due to Dogswell products. I started ordering them again just 2 months ago, noticed the treats were back to normal looking like they used to look, thought nothing strange of it and starting giving it to him again but being still on prednizone it's hard to say if any further damage was now done. I am stopping the purchase of these treats and throwing the rest away. I wanna thank the public for your reviews and it has helped me so much understand maybe what has been going on with my baby. Sure enough after reading everything and did a google search I ran downstairs to check my bags and sure enough it said made in CHINA, I nearly passed out, This is a huge eye opener for me and from now on I will be buying only homemade dog treats made from people I know and my treats from stores like "THREE DOG BAKERY" here in Las Vegas, Nevada were I now will know what my dog is getting. This country has purely gone to shit and this sickens me that my baby suffered due to greed once again. Let's fight back and NEVER EVER buy anything with the label "MADE IN CHINA" I don't care what it is or how great a deal it is, this must be stopped some how as it seems everything is being made in China, please help the fight, you and your dogs life depends on it. Thanks again for the reviews and concerns of the caring people out there.

review/summary: Dogswell chicken and apple, banana, sweet potato treats
review/text: I've purchased the 3 types of treats thru Subscribe and Save.  They are no longer supplied by Amazon and I am not surprised. You can still obtain them from other vendors on Amazon.  Be aware they look nothing like the product pictured. The quality has deteriorated and is now poor at best. The apple treats are now nickel sized pieces of apple(more like little sponges)and the chicken strip around the apple is nearly black in color. It is beyond hard. Whats with this?  The ingredients state this is supposed to be chicken breast!  BEWARE-THESE TREATS ARE MADE IN CHINA!!  I cringe to think what may have been substituted.<br /><br />There was no notice by Amazon that these came from China-known for manufacturing deadly dog products.  I would never have purchased them. I suggest you don't either.  My dog no longer eats them.  I have nearly $100 of product.  I can't with a good conscience donate these to the animal shelter or even toss them out for the crows. Inquire as to the country of origin before you buy - "distributed by" doesn't count.  There are many other safe and healthy treats available and they proudly state 'made in America'!

review/text: I bought these for my Dalmatian for the first time about a month ago. He LOVED them...so much that even though I only gave him the recommended amount per day for his weight class he STOPPED EATING HIS FOOD.<br /><br />I went in to Petco and spoke with a customer service rep who told me a couple of people had come in with similar experiences. He said he was personally curious about it and did some research online and pulled up some reviews (which we looked up together while I was in the store) of people with the same issue. We discovered Dogswell now makes this product in China. Whether or not that automatically makes it unsafe I don't know but given the other reviews and the sign from my own dog I am no longer willing to risk it. Do some research - google "Dogswell made in china" and decide for yourself.

When that happens he seems to come with all the material things that help make him happy.  That includes a large jar of assorted treats. Sometimes I'd wonder why they're called treats because he often doesn't get excited by any of the many varieties that jar contains.  I mentioned this to my daughter and she referred me to this product. We ordered it (from Amazon) on his last visit and I was amazed at how quickly he accepted and consumed them when offered. Unlike others which he might shun or sometimes take and may not actually eat, the Happy Hips treats were always eaten right away. Both Dodger and I rate this product as a "buy now".

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these.  I knew my dog liked sweet potatoes and because I've been buying Dogswell Happy Hips brand treats for years I thought we'd give it a try.  Here's the skinny:<br /><br />They are smaller than the other treats.  This is because they are pieces of dried sweet potato with chicken wrapped around them!  This makes them a bit chewy and thus should work well to aid in the daily cleansing of your dog's teeth.  There is no unpleasant odor, nor is there an oily or greasy residue.  They are the same high quality treats we've become accustomed to buying from Dogswell.  Our dog LOVES them and we'll be buying them again in the future as they are a nice change from the "meat" jerky varieties she has been eating for years.  Next time we'll try apple!

review/text: For them, they just like how they taste.  For me, I like the fact that they have the glucosamine added to them, and that they are just very basic food, chicken and sweet potato.  I would have given this 5 stars if it was made in the US.  I'll probably always, now, be somewhat suspicious of any pet foods or snacks that are made in any part in China.  My older dog is very creaky and arthritic, and so far we haven't found anything that helps ease her pain, so I can't attest to the healing properties of the glucosamine/chondroitin in these snacks, but I figure it can't hurt to feed her foods that contain them.

He is also a picky eater when it comes to treats and he takes these every time.

review/summary: Our Dog Loves These Treats
review/text: Our vet told us to switch our dog to a treat that contained ingredients he hadn't had on a regular basis because we're working to determine what is producing an itchy allergic reaction.  So far it looks like he may be allergic to chicken and maybe corn, neither is in this treat.  Amazon has a better price on this than any other place that carries them. The only problem we have is now the dog tends to "guard" the hall chest where we keep the treats and gaze hopefully at anyone walking through.  :-)<br /><br />Our dog has been getting them for about a month.  While puppy-sitting, I also gave the same treat to my Mom's dog and my brother's dog.  They both went nuts for the treat too.  I'll admit that's not exactly a discriminating audience (they aren't finicky dogs) but it seems to be quite popular.

review/summary: Unhappy hips! supplied by AMAZON
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141OWXU">Dogswell Veggie Life Vitality Sweet Potato Chew Treats for All Dogs, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>A year ago these treats were perfect and my pooch loved them, "just what the doctor ordered". HOWEVER, the recent shipments have been of inferior quality, poor quality. The product is dried-up and as far as my dog is concerned, unacceptable. She refuses to eat the treats and walks away from them. While the expiration date is in 2012 the product has to be tossed, it is anything but fresh.<br /><br />What illuminates this even more is that the local pet store is now stocking these treats. At the pet store, the products look and are soft and well managed and loved by the pooch. Clearly the treats from the AMAZON vendor is without quality and may have been rejects.<br /><br />While the cost in the pet store is much higher, it is well worth it.  Proves that you get what you pay for. If  it is 'Happy Hips' that your dog likes go the pet store or perhaps AMAZON will find a quality supplier.

review/text: I like Dogswell products and have purchased the "Vitality" Chicken Chews before (which are actually chewy). But these sweet potato chews are hard as a rock! I seriously couldn't even chew them, it was like biting a lolipop or jawbreaker - way too hard.  My dog and my roomie's dog didn't care for them one bit.  I purchased them because they were on sale (deeply discounted) and now I know why....<br /><br />Buy other Dogswell Chews, just not these sweet potato ones...

review/text: In my search to find yummy treats for my dog, that don't make him sick, I stumbled upon happy hips, which is perfect since my dog is a lab mix predisposed to hip problems.  He loves them!!  In fact he has gotten to the point where he refuses other dog treats.  I love the fact that these are all natural and my only complaint is that it was a little pricey (over $7 per bag) and a little difficult to find.  Well, amazon took care of that!  They came quickly and were quite a deal.  I will purchase again and again.

review/summary: Dogs love them but ... seems to make them sugar high?
review/text: I have two young dogs, a dachshund (1yr) and  a chihuahua (6mths).  I use these to crate train them.  This treat seems to cause them to be overly excited and even after eating, they would go to extremes to try to get more.  Good motivator.  But I am not sure if it's the natural sugar from the banana. I have many different treats for them before but this treat seems to make them super "high" and they had to race many laps in the yard to get off that energy.  Maybe someone who has the same experience can comment on this observation.  Overall, I am satisfied with the price of the item.  I wish the pieces were a little smaller since they are about a quarter size (too big for my small dogs). Recommended not more than 2 pcs a day for small dog under 20lbs.

review/summary: My dogs won't eat this!
review/text: My dogs love the Dogswell supplements made from chicken, so I assumed they'd also like the sweet potato supplements.  Neither of them would eat it!  Even my aggressive chewing lab didn't like these.  They're almost impossible to chew (unless I soak them in boiling water for at least 30 minutes, which presumably would leech the nutrients from the chews).  When the lab first tried these, they cut her gums, and when she would leave pieces of the chew on the floor, if I stepped on them before noticing them, they'd cut my foot!  I noticed this about ALL the varieties of Dogswells Sweet Potato Chews.  I threw them all out.

review/summary: Great Substitute for Freebirds Chicken Apple Wedges When You Can't Find Them.
review/text: Our dogs love the Freebird chicken apple wedges, but the economic two-pound bag is too hard to find since I purchased them at here-today-gone-tomorrow Costco.  The small bags are a bit pricey BUT they're not made in China.  My brother always insisted that we only buy dog food made in the USA when we had our three labs.  Now I have a beagle and a blue heeler with my guy, and we are always trying to treat them for good behavior.  I found and buy these at Petco.  The bag has more content than the usual packs of Freebirds, and they like them as well, but I didn't realize until reading other reviewer comments where they came from.  Filled with condroitin and glucosamine for the mature dog with hip problems (the blue heeler), I thought I'd give them a try.  Though I don't see any distinct improvement in our 12 year-old Sydney's hips, I don't see anything detrimental either.  They come to the cupboard after coming in from outside or a bath just as before and gobble them down like a kid with candy.  The China factor makes me a little uneasy, especially at that price, but I see no ill effects thus far.  I asked my vet today what she thought, and she said that they're probably fine as long as they're not recalled, but the laws in China are less strict about what they put in their products.  It makes me wonder if I want to risk my dogs being a recall factor if that should happen, so use your own judgement.  All I know is that my own canines love them, and others here seem to have no problem with them either.

He'll turn his nose up at filet mignon, but will wolf down a Snausage!  Of course I would rather he eat something somewhat healthy and I have bought many 15 oz. bags of Happy Hips treats through local merchandisers for around $18.99 a bag (plus tax).  Comes to a little over $20 a bag.  Three 15 oz. bags through Amazon with shipping - around $35, vs. three 15 oz. bags through local retailers - over $60.  Same great product - do the math.

review/text: The Dogswell Happy Hips Sweet Potato Chews I bought from Amazon were stale.  I have bought these before, in local stores, and they are supposed to be pliable and "chewy".  Although the bags had expiration dates that were in code, each bag I opened, contained "stale" chews.  They broke like crackers and I could hear my dog chomping on them like a bone.  I buy them so I can bend them over and put them in her toys or bones - she can spend a lot of time trying to get at the "treat".  With these, all I could do was feed them to her like snack crackers.  I was very disappointed.  I will continue to buy them, as they are a good product, just not from Amazon.

review/summary: Not as large as expected
review/text: Well my fault for ordering cat food from a non pet supplier. These were NOT the larger bags I expected. These are 3 tiny almost sample size? Sighsssss live and learn. Dont order any cat food from this place. Its a rip off.

review/summary: If you are watching your weight, don't break this seal
review/text: You know how shortbread can frequently be boring?  Patterson's does a nice "finger style" and Royal Edinburgh does the very best petticoat tails, so it is helpful to only open these when you are sharing or just don't break the seal on the package in the first place--they are nicely crunchy without being too crumbly, and really nice flavor so the little devils call out to you when they are in the house.  Better than I bake on my own--and I have had practice!
