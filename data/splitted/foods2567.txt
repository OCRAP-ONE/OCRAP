review/summary: The Best Crystal Light Flavor
review/text: Crystal Light Pure has no artificial flavorings, no perservatives and is sweetened with sugar and stevia. While I wish this was only sweetened with stevia it is only 15 calories. I usually drink on packet with 16.9-ounces of water. One packet is just enough for one bottle of water unlike other flavors which are weaker. This also has turmeric in it which is good for you. So if you are trying to decide between artificially flavored and sweetened drinks and something with stevia I'd go with this drink. When you drink this lemonade you will feel like summer never ends.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Delicious, better for you, and lower calorie!!
review/text: I never liked regular Crystal light because I am not a huge fan of artificial sweeteners.  This is a great alternative for people who don't like traditional artificial sweeteners (C L Pure has Truvia and sugar) and are watching calories.<br /><br />It's slightly higher in calories than propel, which is 20 kcal for 16 oz of drink.  This drink is 30 kcal for 16 oz.  It's hardly anything at all.  I love it.  I wish that they had this in a more than just single use packets.  Unlike Propel, it doesn't have all the electrolytes, which is good for me.  The electrolytes in Propel leave me feeling thirstier.<br /><br />Unfortunately the prices on Amazon leave something to be desired!!  $4 per package is not a good price!

review/text: I have been addicted to the lemon pure fitness, no longer available here or at my local store.  I tried the new Pure, it's just as good with real sugar and a little artificial sweetener.  I give the product five (5) stars and the price from this seller as less than zero.  Until Amazon offers it at a decent price, I will have to buy it local, what a tough world sometimes huh.

review/summary: Is This Hot Horseradish?
review/text: This may be exactly what hot Kosher Horseradish is suppose to be. But compared with other horseradishes it is not at all hot, it is very vinegery. I opened two jars and three of us all agreed, Not Hot, too vinegary. Amazon gave a refund, I will take the other ten jars to a food bank. The two I opened if someone wants mild vinegary horseradish they get them. I am buying a jar of Beaver brand at the grocer.

review/summary: Strawberry pie
review/text: I've made strawberry and raspberry pie with Junket Danish Desert for about 50 years. It's the #1 favorite desert of my family and friends. But alas, for the past couple of decades mainstream supermarkets have not been carrying the  product. I had an all points bulletin out with my friends that if they were in some little town with an independent market or perhaps an IGA to check for Danish Desert! But came the day when I was down to my last packet and making strawberry pie for my best friend. "Better enjoy it,"  I said. Whereupon she went to my computer, brought up [ASIN:B00473UBEQ Junket Danish Dessert Raspberry, 4.75-Ounce (Pack of 12)]]at Amazon and ordered me a dozen boxes.And that's how I've  done  it ever since.

review/text: These are so good.  I think my grandmother might have used these, but I'd forgotten all about them, and then I saw them in an upscale grocery store.  I had so much fun with the first two packs I bought, I ordered a case of strawberry and a case of raspberry from Amazon.  I used the junket as a glaze- and then put the glazed strawberry in to puff pastry shells (the kind you can buy premade)- and then topped them with whip cream and a mint leaf from the garden.  My guests were so impressed.  I also put the glazed berries in individual Keebler graham cracker pies, and topped them with whip cream- also a big hit, and the rest of the berries I used in parfaits.  I cannot wait to get more of this stuff.

review/summary: My favorite See's Candy
review/text: I like See's chocolate because it tastes like chocolate, unlike so many other reasonably priced chocolate candy.  I like the fact that you get a quality taste for a reasonable price.  The chocolate tastes like a hearty real chocolate (instead of a sugar bite) and the caramel and marshmallow are the perfect compliment to just the right amount of chocolate.  I find that one or two at the most are a great treat for some one who is watching their weight but is craving a good tasting chocolate.  Rich tasting and satisfying.<br /><br />P.S. The only caveat I have is that when you order in the summer you pay additional charges due to the heat.  I think there are locations that sell See's candies though.<br /><br />P.P.S. Their lolly pops are great!

To 16 oz of Chobani lo-fat plain yogurt, drizzle 8 cc (1 1/2 tsp) of Mango extract and 2-3 tiny spoonfuls of Kal stevia. Wait 10min for the alcohol to evaporate. Mix and refridgerate.

review/text: I've been eating Adzuki beans for many years and these Chimes ones are among the very high qualities! Adzuki beans are high in iron, protein and fibers, so they are good choices of healthy food. Easy to cook, just soak the beans in cold water for about an hour (the cooking instructions say soaking for overnight which is not necessary.) and then add 4-5 cups of water to half a pound Adzuki beans, bring to a boil and return to low. Cook for about an hour and a half, add sugar then you can enjoy delicious Adzuki bean soup. Great as snacks.

I used a non digital scale so I could have been off slightly. All total I got 9-1/4 lbs. I knew what I was getting when I ordered these.  They came in the white box everyone described, but I had not pictured how small the box really is.  My box measured 6-1/4" tall, by 5-3/4 wide by 10-1/2 inches long.  Product is super fresh and has the famous "Jelly Belly" printed on the side of each bean.  Definately purchase these again.

review/text: This is high quality curry for next to nothing. Three pounds for the price of four little bottles. I go through a pound a month. To preserve freshness keep it in the refrigerator.<br /><br /> 8/5/2011 Update: This has been out of stock for quite awhile. Glad to see it's back,  I've since tried Marshal Creek and Sun brand. Neither came close. All the rest were way too expensive.<br /><br />5/22/2012 Update: A different company bought the brand and completely changed the formula (the lable is the same but without "D&D Gold Product"). There is so much very hot chili pepper mixed in that it completely overwhelms the curry. More than two tbsp of curry in two gallons of vegetable soup makes it so hot it's nearly inedible. Too bad! This used to be really good curry. I can't recommend it anymore.

review/text: This product contains propylene glycol and BHA which is poisonous to dogs. Look it up. We threw away a $20.00 bag of pup peroni tonight. Our dog began having seizures after we started a training class with her where they recommended using pup peroni. We used the pup peroni as a training treat as recommend. Not realizing that was the culprit for the seizures, she was placed on seizure medication. We completed the class, we stopped with the pup peronis. We just purchased another pup, and began training with him. Because he was getting the pup peronis, so was the 2 year old dog and she began having seizures again. In researching this, we found there is a link between pup peroni (propylene glycol) and seizures. Poisoning....Buyer beware.

BUT, my friend's dog just died after eating a treat from Wal-Mart from the Wagon Wheel line that is made in China.<br />I looked at my label on my Pup-Peroni and it is Distributed By: Del Monte Pet Products, San Francisco Ca. WHERE IS IT MADE? I will not buy another bag of this until you tell me.

review/summary: Where are these made
review/text: I wish they would indicate where these treats are made. DO you really want to give your dog anything made in China. If its not fit for human consumption how can it be good for your dog. Of course my dog loves these treats, But I wont buy again until and unless they indicate they are made in the USA

review/text: Our dog loves Pup-Peroni.  Ever since he was a small puppy, he has opened the packages himself.  He now has it down to a science.  Hold the pack with one paw, rip a small hole in the top and pull the pup-peroni out one at a time.  There is no mess, just an empty package when done.  Only problem is finding the 1.2 oz packages.  We like to order by the case but can't seem to find anyone who has available stock.

review/summary: Our Dog Tina's Favorite Snack!
review/text: We order lean Pupperoni by the case her on amazon. Our Shih-Tzu, Tina, loves it. Not only do we give it to her as a treat, we break one up in her food in the morning to make it more palatable to her. We put medicine in her food which deters her from eating it, but the Pupperoni always fixes that.<br /><br />Tina is very finiky and will eat very few types of treats. Pupperoni is her favorite. We've even modified songs in our family to honor the Pupperoni ... "I can't smile without Pupperoni" (Manilow) is a favorite!

review/summary: I can't give them to my dog anymore
review/text: My dog used to really like these, but I can't give them to her anymore because I'm afraid they're poisoned by the Chinese. The Chinese poison dog food you know. Anyway, I used to feed them to her all the time, until the Chinese started poisoning the food. Then I was afraid. I decided that I would have to test all the food before I gave it to my dog. I tried one of these and it made me really sick. I didn't feel well at all so I knew it was poisoned. Now I don't feed them to her anymore. Now all I feed her are Pillsbury Croissants. She really seems to like them a lot. Of course, I still test them before giving them to her. They all seem OK, I would recommend feeding them to your pet. The only peoblem is that she seems to be gaining quite a bit of weight.

review/summary: A Big Ripoff!
review/text: I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!

review/text: I mixed this Golden Vanilla with Simply Organic's Carrot Cake and followed the vegan recipes on both boxes (and actually did the pumpkin variation rather than the carrots) and it was SOOOOO delightful.  My normal-eating husband said it was better than the famous pumpkin rolls I used to make before becoming gluten-free.  We basically sat together and ate the leftovers (from a party we made it for) all in one sitting.  I love the carrot cake box all by itself and I definitely want to try this one alone, but haven't done it just yet.  It can't possibly be as good as their popular carrot/spice/pumpkin cake, but I still have high hopes.

review/summary: where's the milk?
review/text: Ah, nothing like old times.  Remember the days when your parents would sit you down at the kitchen table and prepare a plate of oreo cookies and a glass of milk?  They'd smile and watch you eat knowing full well you deserved such a scrumptious snack.  We'll just ignore the unusualness of that situation and focus on their intentions- that being, to watch their child (you, of course) enjoy a tasty dessert for such a hard working performance concerning your school grades.  This is when mom or dad would sit down and dip cookies in the milk with you.  Parents and children happily eating cookies together.  You know those commercials you see on TV aren't far from the truth- there really *is* somewhat of a family gathering when it comes to cookie-dipping milk scenarios.  Cherish them.<br /><br />This package being sold here on amazon for Nabisco Oreo Cookies is high priced and you're much better off buying the same exact cookies in your downtown (or uptown) grocery store.  Be cautious with these expensive prices you see on amazon.

I added a mixture of chicken & fish and was pleasantly surprised when I lifted the lid to my pot and saw that the jambalaya was ready to eat! I'm definitely ordering this mix again!<br /><br />A word of caution! They mix was a little spicy. I love spicy food so it wasnt a problem for me but some people may find it a little to hot for their taste.

If you like horseradish you are going to love these wasabi peas.  The bite comes in after you have your first handful. They are great snacks to have a work and will also help cleanse your sinuses. I was only able to find a can half this size at the local Meijer Store so I was happy to see Amazon carries the same brand in a bigger can and you can also purchase a four pack to have plenty in stock at home and work.

review/text: Walmart has 12 of the 9 oz tins for $40 while amazon sells 4 for $27. Big difference! These peas are consistently crunchy and the wasabi is strong and never stale. These are worth the extra money cause other brands are bland compared to these. One thing to keep in mind is that they are addicting. If you eat a cup of these, you wont ba able to taste your dinner cause you taste buds will be shot.

review/summary: Just The Right Amount of Wasabi
review/text: I have tried a lot of Wasabi Peas but these are the best because the amount of Wasabi is just right for me.  You can still taste the sweetness of the peas mixed with the wasabi.  Great for a person on a diet, like me, for a snack.  A snack of 24 peas (14 grams) is only 65 calories and very satisfying.  I measured the number of peas using my gram scale.  I find I must measure them out and only eat 24 for a snack otherwise the entire can is gone, and that is not good for a person on a diet.  Great product, will order more and I love the Prime service from Amazon which gives me free 2nd Day Air Shipping.  Will buy Amazon stock on the dips. We seem to be buying more stuff now on Amazon than we do locally, I think this will become more of a trend with most folks.

review/summary: Horseradish Peas
review/text: When I first got my order and open the can so I can eat some, I realized These peas aren't even that hot and didn't even taste like wasabi. A quick look at the ingredients label confirmed my suspicions when I saw the ingredient Horseradish labeled on it. Unfortunately for me I bought 4 cans.

review/summary: Overpriced
review/text: Wasabi peas are delicious, healthy, natural, and a great alternative to less healthy snacks. However, these particular Wasabi peas are way over priced. You're much better off buying in bulk, like these excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002VXZ40">Wasabi Peas</a>. They are just as tasty, and much, much cheaper.

review/summary: MMMMMM!!!
review/text: Wow!  This is a silky soft, lusciously textured tuna with a fresh-from-the-sea flavor.  Just salty enough and so good it can be eaten straight from the jar.  I've tried a bunch of other high-end tunas (bonito del norte, regular yellowfin, high-quality albacore, etc), and yellowfin ventresca (from the fatty tuna belly) is the only type that felt like it was worth every penny.  Other brands are also good, but I especially like tonnino!

review/text: Yes, these are a little more expensive than your supermarket solid white Albacore in oil, but that's like comparing Filet Mignon and hamburger.  You actually get a very decent amount of tuna per bottle here, and it's all lush, luscious Ventresca.  With quality like this, even a little goes a long way!

review/summary: Delightful flavor, silky texture. Wonderful!
review/text: Tuna Ventresca is the very best tuna in oil you can buy and Tonnino is an excellent brand. If you are lucky to find it locally, buy a jar and you'll get instantly hooked. It tastes SO much better than regular canned tuna.<br /><br />This is not the tuna you'd use for tuna salad or sandwiches, keep buying the regular canned tuna for that. The ventresca (fillets from the tender belly of the tuna) shines as the centerpiece of a salad (e.g., salade ni�oise) or on toasted rounds of baguette or crackers.<br /><br />Six or so years ago I spotted the red label tuna jars at Trader Joe's; back then they were $4.99 which seemed rather expensive to me, but the tuna inside those jars looked so nice I just had to try it. The following week I bought a half dozen jars and kept replenishing my stock until TJ stopped carrying this tuna a couple of years later. I've been looking for it ever since, but very few stores carry it locally and the price has gone up quite a bit.<br /><br />About a month ago I was very happy to find tuna Ventresca here, but it was by a different manufacturer (Roland) and it was canned. I ordered it, regardless, because the price was reasonable and I was hoping that the taste and texture would be the same as the Tonnino brand, but it wasn't.<br /><br />Luckily, Ventresca by Tonnino is now available so I discontinued my Subscribed and Save order for the Roland brand and ordered two cases of this wonderful Tonnino packed in glass jars. When you order two cases (from the vendor Taylor Market), the s/h cost stays almost the same ($35.95 per 6-jar case x 2 + just over $8 s/h).<br /><br />Also, the vendor (Taylor's Market) does a great job of packing the jars. They arrived in perfect condition, see photos under "customer images".<br /><br />I realize this review is rather wordy, but I wanted to let prospective buyers know that one can get a very good deal by ordering two cases.<br /><br />Right now only two retailers carry this wonderful tuna Ventresca in my area and both charge $6.99 per jar. Thanks to Taylor's deal here on Amazon I save a few dollars and don't have to drive 35 miles to get this delightful treat.

review/text: From past experience, I know this is wonderful tuna.  Sadly, 4 out of 4 jars were unsealed when they arrived.  The oil had leaked completely out of one, and none were under vacuum (the paper seals were still intact, but the lids were all loose), making all 4 jars unsafe to eat.

review/summary: Best catch in the sea..
review/text: I really love this Tonnino ventrescas tuna. I had been a shopper at BJ's wholesale club for many years. They offered a similar product of tuna filet that I would purchase often(double pack 6 oz jar). As usual, though, they discontinued selling it in their clubs.<br /><br />So I took to the internet, searching various sites, checking out Amazon.com. Came across the ventrescas filets on the site. I have not regretted the purchase. I like that it is packed in olive oil and jarred(no can taste). The price was the best at approx $6.46 a jar. I bought two cases which brought the price under $6.00 a jar. The vendor(Taylor's Market) packaged the shipment great, no broken jars. Great customer service..

review/text: ... so there's no reason to wax eloquent. I came upon the Tonnino brand in a supermarket, not here in the 'zoo, and I'll probably choose to buy it at the same market whenever I feel a craving for Ni�oise salad, but this review is my thank-you to the canners and the importers. Tonnino tuna really is superb in quality, as much better than any other brand as a live concert is better than music on a car radio.

review/text: I'd never heard of "tuna ventresca" before, so I thought I'd try some - and I must say it is the tastiest tuna I've ever had in my entire life, and well worth the rather steep price tag.  FAR superior to the run-of-the-mill tuna out of a can, such that there simply is no comparison.<br /><br />The first time I ever tried a jar, I ended up eating the entire contents in one sitting!  Try it - you'll probably like it!<br /><br />Somehow I have a feeling that this stuff is going to be habit-forming - but a healthy habit for sure!

review/text: Read about Tonnino Tuna Ventresca in Cook's Illustrated as I was looking for a higher quality tuna to use in a "grown up" version of Tuna Casserole.  Found it at my Whole Foods for $5.99 per jar. It was excellent!  Lovely pink fillets which tasted so flavorful and fresh with the right amount of salt. I was so very happy with my new tuna casserole that I can't wait to make it again. Will not be going back to the old fashioned tuna in the can that I grew up with.  Great to see your tuna as well in that lovely little jar! Go buy this now.

review/text: How they can advertise this product as "healthy" when it contains hydrogenated oil is beyond me. Clearly they have sold their souls to the devil. Because the FDA (also in the devil's pocket) allows products to advertise "no trans fat" when the amount of trans fat per serving is .5 g or less, these people can get away with lying to the American public. Weight Watchers is also to blame for endorsing ANY product with hydrogenated oil in it.<br /><br />READ YOUR LABELS CAREFULLY, FOLKS: corporations don't care about your health.

review/text: I am still enjoying this,however, I would like to see more flavors added,as I know Coffee-mate has many more flavors. I love, love, love the pump action, and it does not have to be refrigerated.As far as the taste goes, it has not lost the flavor of french vanilla just because it is in a pump bottle, if anything it tatses better. The bottle recommends one pump, now here is where I beg to differ, use as many pumps as you like at your own discretion, I did, one pumps was not cutting it for me. A matter of opinion, mine. Yes, it does last thirty days or longer depending on how much you use and how many other people use it. I am the only one using it so it lasted a tad bit longer than thirty days. I also tried the Sweet cream flavor, and I really liked this one too,it made my coffe really pop when added. I really like this and I will be buying more,just please please please try to add more flavors. Thank you

review/summary: Perfect for home use!
review/text: I wanted to use the concentrated pump creamer because of the convenience and savings.  However, I could only find the food service size, which was approximately 40 ounces!  The creamer goes bad after 6 months and I ended up throwing out a lot of product.  I was browsing Amazon the other day and found this 21.1 ounce size and was so excited!  The convenience I wanted and not something that is so large it will spoil before I can use it.  And if you still really want creamer in the fridge in the pour bottle, save a coffee-mate pour bottle, wash it out, pump some of this into it and add water.  It's the same thing and you can continue to refill it for a fraction of the cost.  I also save those store-bought coffee mate creamer containers with the spout on them to keep sugar in, restaurant style, so that I can keep my baking sugar away from people's dirty coffee spoons, and it works like a charm.  If you are all about saving money but not sacrificing flavor, buy this product!

We were delighted when we found  this product. It works wonderfully, and relieves his distress (and ours). I know he is grateful and appreciates being fed food that doesn't cause gastric distress.  How do I know this...he doesn't even go near the poodles food.  This product was removed from the pet stores where we used to purchase, so I was excited to find it through an Amazon reseller at an equivalent price.

review/text: We bought this dog food for our beagle who has a sensitive stomach and the tendency to easily pack on the pounds. Eukanuba does not have the ingredients list and nutritional analysis online, but it is on the bags. This particular food's fat content is 17%! To put that in perspective, our equally high end organic puppy food has only 12% fat. Needless to say, our beagle picked up 3 pounds in 1 month on this food. Also, she was still vomiting once a week. We're now giving the Eukanuba to the 10 month old puppy and have switched our adult dog to Natural Balance's limited ingredient formula. The puppy seems to like the Eukanuba, but she had no digestion problems to begin with.
