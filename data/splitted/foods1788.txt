review/text: Many American recipes use cooking sherry instead of sweet rice wine.  Where ever you see sherry in an Asian recipe use this to create a much more authentic flavor.

review/summary: NOT Feta
review/text: The package label looks different than this one but it says Mount Sterling Goat Milk Feta Greek Style. I USED TO buy lots of it because I loved it. It was nice and crumbly for salads and omelets and a bunch of other recipes. Flavoful with a long shelf life.<br />NOT ANY MORE.<br />I was surprised when I opened a package to crumble it into my salad and it wasn't crumbly. No different than any sliceable cheese. I figured it just a labeling mistake and returned it to the store. A while later, same thing and I returned it to the store. I dug down to the bottom of the heap and found the last 3 packages of REAL feta. You can even see the difference from the outside of the package. This is part of the description on their own website, "This DRY,CRUMBLY cheese is excellent in dishes with vegetables". The label picture is exactly the same as the one I buy (and I just looked again today).<br />I emailed Mount Sterling, politely explaing the situation. I figured they'd want to know. I received a curt reply telling me that I was welcome to return it to the store. Then about a month ago I decided to try once again, even though it still didn't look like feta through the package. I bought it anyway and it isn't nice crumbly feta so I returned it again. I have checked other cops and it is the same.<br />I like their cheeses including the raw milk chedder but I'll not be so likely to buy from a company<br />that doesn't care about either explaining or correcting a problem. It doesn't exactly make me trust the quality.<br />They may sell this feta now, but as soon as the buyers try to crumble it, they won't be buying any more. I am very disappointed, as I loved this cheese.

review/summary: Nice Look, So-So Taste
review/text: Gold coins are a Christmas stocking tradition in our house (from Santa, of course) and, let's face it, most look cute but taste horrible. I bought these for my son's birthday party pinata and they arrived promptly, in a plastic bucket, all in great condition. The coins are large, the foil bright and tight and the chocolate just so-so ... But not terrible and better than a lot of gold coin chocolates I've had in the past. All in all, a good price for a good product, just don't go in expecting gourmet. You're paying for the fun factor, not the candy itself.

Fortunately, the coins don't seem to be damaged (though 1 coin looked like the wrapper was kinda loose. I guess I'll eat that one instead of giving that to the kids). I would give it a very high rating had it not been for the broken bucket. I obviously can't reuse the bucket due to the monstrous hole in its side, but that's ok. I ordered some red envelopes for the kids.

review/summary: The best kept secret for the best spaghetti sauce
review/text: Spatini used to be available to the average American in little packets sold in boxes of three at the supermarket.  Unfortunately, the company making Spatini was bought by the evil conglomerate Unilever, which dropped consumer Spatini in favor of their 2 Lawry's (inferior) spaghetti sauce mixes.  For some secret reason, though, Spatini has remained available in these 'restaurant' sized packages and that's a good thing!  Buy it like there's no tomorrow because Unilever is not to be trusted. 3 tbsp are approximately equivalent to 1 packet of the old product.  In response to the other reviewer, add a little sugar or agave to desalinate the taste of the current product and to decrease the acidity of the tomatoes.

review/summary: Spatini sauce is really good.
review/text: It's unfortunate that you can only buy Spatini in quantities to feed an army. One family sized batch only needs 3 Tablespoons of Spatini mix, but the minimum order is 4 packages of 15 oz (each pkg is enough for 60 servings).  This has a wonderful flavor, though, and if you are cooking for any large group, or a church soup kitchen, it is also easy and inexpensive.  Spatini sauce is delicious made with tomato paste and water so you don't have to carry the 10 pound cans of tomatoes to cook for a big group.

review/text: While I haven't bought the big bags yet, every time my sister or I went back home to the North East, we would stock up and basically buy all that was on the shelf.  Since it has been discontinued, I actually found a recipe to make it myself - and it isn't too bad.  Not the same, but close enough.<br /><br />As for the title of this review, yea, I put a packet in my sauce, but I also use a packet in my meatloaf and/or meatballs.  It gives it just that little more of a tasty kick to them.<br /><br />I will buy this - probably at least 4 packs (to share with my sisters) but until I get around to it, I will continue to make my own.

review/summary: Life Saver
review/text: Let me just say that this food has been a life saver.  One of my male cats has suffered from horrible hairballs all of his life.  I tried science diet, nutro, blue buffalo, you name it.  Finally one day I ended up at the Emergency Vet (weekend of course) with a very sick cat.  Come to find out he had a hairball that had lodged in his intestine and blocked it.  Luckily he was OK.  The vet recommended this food and we have been great ever since (2.5 years now).  He still throws up the occasional hair ball, but wow they have decreased in frequency and size.  I love this food and so does my cat.<br /><br />The only problem that I have had with this food is from Amazon's packaging process.  When it comes from Amazon, the bag is somehow ripped open or cut open every time.  When it comes from petfood direct, no problems ever.  Not sure what Amazon is doing wrong, but they need to figure it out as this is not exactly cheap cat food.

review/summary: Another quality Royal Canin Product
review/text: Do your research before buying just any bag of cat food.  Your cat would probably love the taste of the $5 bag of mass market garbage on the shelf at your local grocery store (NEVER buy pet food from a grocery store - do you buy food for your own consumption at an animal store?).  That $5 bag of slop comes with a much higher price.  Many of the big brand cat food producers use ingredients of poor quality and aren't easily digestible.  Many of these same companies test their food on cats kept locked up in small cages 24x7.  Royal Canin products have high quality products, my cats love the taste and I can sleep at night with a clear conscience that my money was spent on a quality product made by a respected company that does not mistreat animals.  My thanks to Royal Canin.

Finally I brought him to the vet, spend $1000 trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with him (he was also worrying the base of his tail bald and howling). We switched him to a novel protein diet (venison) and intense hairball (this product) and like magic, everything cleared up. He still barfs from time to time, but it's gone from an every day occurrence to a once every few weeks occurrence.

review/text: Hairballs are frequent in our household so I thought I would give this a try. (The cat pictured on the bag looks just like my Teddy - I hope that's not what influenced me to buy this!) I have been using one type or another of Royal Canin dry food for ten years. They Intense Hairball 34 gets eaten so I have no complaints. I would not say this eliminates hairballs completely, but it does seem to reduce the frequency and that's enough for me. I mix this with two other dry foods (one Royal Canin and one grain-free organic) to try to meet all my cats' nutritional needs.

review/summary: It worked on a 14-yr-old cat
review/text: I have my mother's cat now.  He isn't allowed outside.  He threw up on what seemed to be the majority of surfaces in her house, and was proceeding to leave what seems to be indelible marks on my floors, and rugs, and furniture.<br />This cat food has stopped that.<br />Despite having the old cat food, Purina One, still in his dish, he ate this anti-hairball cat food so fast when I opened the bag and put it into his dish, that I was sure I would have him throwing it up all over the place.  Didn't happen.<br />Things were better within 2 days, and he has now stopped any of the choking, throwing up, etc.  I haven't found any, seen any, or heard anything.<br />It's been a couple of weks now, and he still seems to love the food, and my life is much better.<br />I think it is well worth the price, and I am very glad I took the chance.

review/summary: Royal Canin Intense Hairball...is the best!
review/text: I had learned about Royal Canin's Intense Hairball formula (for cats) last year, from a friend of a friend.  I finally started using it about 6-months ago and I was amazed and elated at how well it works.  Among a number of others, I have a family of Maine Coons in the house and the addition of this food has been a lifesaver, for all.  For various reasons, I am unable to feed everyone "just" the Intense Hairball, so I mix it with their other dry food (though I make sure they're getting a decent portion of the Royal Canin every time I feed them).<br /><br />I had initially been buying the 6-lb bag at a local pet store, but it's quite expensive for that amount, so I checked on Amazon and was happy to find the 15-lb at a decent price, in comparison.  I highly recommend this product to anyone with indoor cats; long-haired and short-haired.

review/summary: Excellent food for hairballs
review/text: My cat was throwing up 2 or 3 times a week and I knew hair was the culprit.  Since my cats have been on this food they only average throwing up about one time per month.  Yes, it cost a little more but it is well worth it.  My cats seem to really enjoy eating it as well. Sometimes I buy the Royal Canin Intense Beauty and mix it with the hairball control.

review/summary: Really worked miracles on our cat (and our sanity..no more vomit!!)
review/text: This food was really a miracle for our cat!  My medium coat Maine Coon mix giant (19lbs, breed normal weight) was throwing up daily, sometimes a couple of times per day, for almost a year until I started him on this food.  It took 1-2 weeks for his digestive system to settle down and for him to slow down while eating, which was both a bi-product of the vomiting/eating cycle and an additional cause of secondary vomiting.<br /><br />Several trips to the doctor and far too much $$$ spent on test hadn't helped.  One vet suspected IBS, another thought food allergies or extreme hairballs, etc. Tried several other hairball or sensitive stomach/allergy brands for 2 week trails, but none helped until this one. A friend/vet suggested trying this brand and it was a godsend! He has only thrown up once now since we started feeding him this about 4 months ago.  He has since added back the weight he lost during that period (was down to 13lbs at one point!!) and his coat seems softer than before too.  The food price seemed pretty high, but it hindsight, it was beyond worth it when you consider the alternative health problems and constant cleaning of vomit.

review/summary: Awesome cat food!
review/text: I been feeding Eukanuba Indoor formula cat food for many years, but noticed as my cats got older (they are now 14 and 15 years old) they started throwing up more and more hairballs and food.  This even though, I tried giving them hairball remedy. I adopted a new kitten in July (for my birthday) and found that the only tiny knibble food I could find was by Royal Canin Baby formula for kittens.  That's when I noticed they carried an "Intense Hairball formula".  So, I decided to feed that to my two older cats.  Well, it did it's magic.  They very rarely throw up anymore!  Now my other kitten (whose 8 month old now)prefers eating the "Intense Hairball 34 Formula" over the "Kitten 36 Formula", which is stage two for kittens 4 mo - 12 months old.  I recommend it for any cat owner whose cat(s) have problem with hairballs or other throwing up issues.

review/summary: I wish it worked, but it doesn't
review/text: "What? $44 for a bag of catfood?" This was my reaction when I clicked on Royal Canin Intense Hairball Formula. Only a 15 lb bag and I'm used to paying about $12 for a 30 pound bag of regular food.<br /><br />But now I was considering the fact that for the the umpteenth time I had stepped into a live hairball with my bare feet in the middle of the night. I was desperate. I'd do anything to stop those hairballs and the reviewers for this food just raved about how it completely cured the problem for them. I gritted my teeth and put the food on my credit card.<br /><br />At first it seemed to help, but sorry to say, I stepped out of bed into a hairball this morning. And there was another pile in the hall and several little gifts have turned up here for the past week or so. I think it's actually worse than before in frequency and output.<br /><br />The only good thing is that this food has no food coloring or dyes in it and therefore is a lot easier to lift the stain than with the $12 food. It also smells wonderful and the cats just love it. The ingredients seem to be top choice. "Well, you little suckers," I said to them, "Too bad you like the food so much. If you just hadn't started throwing up again I would buy it forever. You blew it, kids!"<br /><br />Next I'm going to look for something in between. Something without food color and with hairball control, but less costly. Any ideas out there?

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: I have been purchasing this cat food for my persian since he was a kitten. He is the pickiest cat I have EVER seen, refuses to eat chicken, salmon, or tuna as a treat. He sticks his nose up to the food that was recommended by the vet. And HE LOVES this food. I had him on just the basic Royal Canin, but he was coughing up mutliple hairballs in a day that I couldn't keep up with cleaning them. I swtiched over to the intense hairball shortly after, and now, years later I can honestly say he has coughed up maybe two hairballs at the most. It's a little expensive in the pet store, so online its at least ten dollars cheaper. I did see corn as a large ingredient, but its been amazing for my cat and I will not switch to anything else... not like he would eat it anyways!

review/summary: Hairballs, digestive problems
review/text: I have two siamese cats that have had digestive problems since I bought them as kittens.  The vet stated that it was a new virus that could not be cured without many tests.  The cats had all worm and other shots.  I purchased all the organic and other foods with no change.  One cat developed severe hairballs.  I tried all the treatments, but she still had them.  I then bought a 15lb. Bag of intense hairball and within aweek the hairballs ended.  And also no more digestive problems in the litter box!  The cats love the taste of the kibble and they are finicky eaters.

My cat coughed up hairballs the very next day and days after so product with all its bad ingredients doesn't even work.  I now suspect the few other reviews that were positive were probably written by a seller or manufacturer.

review/summary: Good Stuff...
review/text: I recently purchased a can of Koma Unwind from a local convenience store out of curiosity and loved it. I deal with a lot of stress in my life. I have a large family with several family members that have significant mental health issues. I found myself consuming alcoholic beverages to help me unwind and go to sleep at night. After trying Koma Unwind I've completely cut out the alcohol. I get to sleep faster, am better rested and have the benefit of reducing my caloric intake. I've tried both the regular and sugar free and find them both equally as enjoyable (sticking with the sugar free so I can cut out the calories). Not sure if the description mentions it but the product also contains Milk Thistle which is supposed to help improve liver function. I would describe the effects as something similar to taking a Valium but smoother and for me more pleasant.

You will feel your whole body reach a state of tranquility, while your mind is at a standstill, allowing your natural tiredness to take over. I haven't slept this well since who knows!

review/summary: PRICE IS RIGHT for 16 pack.
review/text: The price is not obscenely overinflated for a "specialty" item like this. Keep in mind, this is the 16-pack, not the 8-pack (which commonly sells for about $3.25.) I say specialty because they are only manufactured in New Jersey and primarily available in the New England area. If you grew up nearby and then moved to California, like I did, you have an appreciation for such things. These are pretty much what you'd expect from a Hostess owned company. They're super sweet, super spongy, and super addicting! Sure, you can get your relatives to send you the 8-pack for $2 and ask them to foot the bill for shipping; but really, if you've got a hankering for these things an extra dollar or two won't really bother you that much. Surely it's not justification for the one star review it received from a previous reviewer.

review/summary: Love this Rice!!
review/text: I love this rice!  It's a very healthy alternative to someone who doesn't want all the sodium from rice-a-roni or other packaged box rice!<br /><br />This doesn't come with any flavoring, and has tiny bits of dehydrated mushrooms and carrots in it.  Cooks in about 20-30 minutes - so quicker than normal rice!  1 cup rice to 2 cups water - to give it a little flavor, I put chicken broth in the place of water, so it has a very slight chicken flavor!  (when my husband is gone - this is all I need for dinner!)<br /><br />The only bad thing that I have to say, is I was slightly disappointed at the size of the jars.  I thought I was getting 6 large jars that you see in the grocery store - and instead these were the smaller jars.  Nothing about the product though, it was my mistake as it was clearly labeled how many ounces are in each jar.  But to put it in perspective for you - only 2 cups of rice per jar.  So each jar makes 6 cups prepared.<br /><br />Enjoy!  I will be ordering it again when I run out!!  =)

review/summary: Please Read Label
review/text: I bought these for my two small dogs. A day after they had them,both acted "off" ,they refused to eat their canned dog food(Wellness).The only thing different in their daily schedule was the Petrodex Dental Chews. I read the label,it states "wash hands after handling". If there is something so toxic in these chews that I must wash my hands after handling,I sure do not want my dogs chewing and eating them.They are in the garbage.If I could have awarded zero stars,I would have.I am going to stick to the Breath Brushers made by Zuke's. Pricier,but worth it to me.

review/summary: Petrodex Dental Chews
review/text: We have a 13 year old beagle, and I noticed that he no longer chews his older toys.  I was worried about his developing dental problems in old age, so we decided to try out Petrodex dental chews.  I think these chews are a great price, and the beagle loves them! He can't wait each evening for his after dinner treat!

review/summary: Good Chews
review/text: I bought these Petrodex chews for my dogs because I like Petrodex toothpaste <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00025K0R6">Petrodex 51106 Enzymatic Toothpaste for Dogs- Poultry Flavor- Economy Size</a>.  The dogs love the chews, especially my lab mix.  The label calls them beefhide.  They look like beefhide, but don't seem to have exactly the same consistency.  It's probably because of the other ingredients:  dextrose, poultry digest, etc. "Product of Mexico."  The "large dog" ones are about 2 1/2 or 3 by 6 inches each.

review/text: This product is so great for my toy pomeranian, GiGi.  She loves to chew these, and they are great for dental hygiene.  these are the only dental chews I give her.  Sometimes companies are out of the small size, so I order these in bulk, when I find them.  Your price was also very reasonable.  She has been using this product for over 5 years.  Thankyou again for the great service in providing them on line in bulk.  Cynthia Kirsch

review/summary: MUCH better than the cheese powder in boxed mac n' cheese
review/text: I first tried this with macaroni, and it was fantastic. Much smoother, tastier and creamier than the boxed macaroni and cheese. I also topped popcorn with it and it was just as good. May try making some homemade cheese crackers next.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Edit: I finally made cheese crackers with this (just replaced a bit of the flour called for in the recipe with cheese powder. Sorry, I rarely measure things--just added it until I was satisfied with the color and smell of the dough.) They turned out really well, much better than store-bought cheese crackers, and I've since made them with a hint of cayenne--delicious.<br /><br />Oh, and for those using it on popcorn, just spray the popcorn with spray oil and the cheese will stick reasonably well.

review/summary: Great for special diet-- pku
review/text: My son is on a very restricted diet, and this cheese sauce is the only one we've found that he can eat but that still tastes like cheese.  We add a container of baby food carrots (and decrease the water) to sneak in extra veggies.  You do not have to boil the water first.  I mix the mix into 1 1/2 cups cold liquid and then cook it from there.  I freeze this in ice cube trays and then can thaw one serving at a time for my son.

review/summary: A powdery version of Velveeta
review/text: We live in Africa and always missed the idea and taste of processed cheese.  I know to some that may seem very strange but for those of us who cannot just run down to the nearest grocery store and choose from 50 different kinds of processed cheese it means a lot to us.  This is an excellent product and I would recommend it to all who are looking for a suitable alternative to the role of Velveeta in things like Macaroni and Cheese, Queso dip and soups.  It keeps for a long time since it is powder and all you add is water so even not having milk will stop you from having a good macaroni dish every now and again.

review/summary: A Great Deal...
review/text: SodaStream soda syrups may be a bit more expensive than off-brands, but this sampler pack is a great way to try out their different offerings and decide for yourself which (if any) flavors of theirs you like the most without committing to an entire 12 liter syrup bottle.  Included in this pack are one trial-size, single-use "vial" of the following flavors:<br /><br />-Orange (Like "Crush)<br />-Diet Dr. Pete (Like "Diet Dr. Pepper")<br />-Energy (Like "Red Bull")<br />-Diet Pink Grapefruit<br />-Diet Lemon-Lime (Like "Diet Sprite")<br />-Root Beer (Like "Barq's")<br />-Diet Cola (Like "Diet Coke")<br />-Dr. Pete (Like Dr. Pepper)<br />-Diet Cranberry-Raspberry<br />-Fountain Mist (Like "Mountain Dew")<br />-Diet Root Beer (Like "Diet Barq's")<br />-Lemon-Lime (Like "Sprite")<br /><br />Each "vial" makes one liter.  The instruction say to "twist-off" the tops, but I find this impracticable and it is much easier to simply cut the tops off with a pair of scissors.  Also, though the box states that it contains "Dr. Pete" and "Diet Dr. Pete," it actually contains "Pete's Choice" and "Diet Pete's Choice."  The name may be the only difference, but I find that these flavors taste more like "Mr. Pibb" than "Dr. Pepper."<br /><br />Finally, if you like "Red Bull," you will be pleasantly surprised with how close this syrup comes to the real deal.  If you buy the SodaStream solely as a "Red Bull" maker, you can save alot of money!<br /><br />All in all, this is a great way to try out the best flavors SodaStream has to offer.  If you do not mind off-brand flavored drinks, you will not be disappointed.  A name-brand soda purist may be able to tell the difference, but I find these quite palatable.

review/summary: Your happiness will depend on your sensitivity to artificial sweeteners
review/text: I recently bought a Sodastream Genesis for the purpose of creating my own club soda. It's a great machine. As an additional experiment, I've tried a few of the flavors from this sampler pack, and I've been rather disappointed with the results.<br /><br />Even the _non diet_ flavors are sweetened with Splenda, and the soda leaves a strange aftertaste in my mouth. If you're used to diet soda, you're likely to find these flavors quite delicious. However, if you're really sensitive to artificial sweeteners, you might want to pass on Sodastream's regular and diet flavorings. (Their website provides nutrition information on all of their flavors, so you can check to see what sweetener is used in each flavoring.)

review/summary: Not too bad...
review/text: I really enjoy the variety available with the sampler pack. The only downfall is that it seems that there isn't enough syrup in the package to prodice 1 full liter. I always carbonate then pour out a little bit of the water to ensure proper flavor. If I dont do this, the drink tastes too much like carbonated water. This is a great idea if you dont want to waste your money trying to figure out your favorite flavors.
