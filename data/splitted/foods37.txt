Plus it is delivered to my door and no shipping charge (Super Saver Shipping), and costs less than the product I used to buy, saving me time and money. Oh yeah, and my dogs love it!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139TT72">Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 12.5-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: Dog loves this food!
review/text: I have a two-year old Jack Russell Terrier and she loves Newman's Own Dog Food! She ate Beneful for a year before switching. This goes down much easier. She doesn't each eat it "just because she's hungry"; she actually likes it! I highly recommend this product and would consider giving any dog nothing less!

review/summary: Great product just need to adjust the subscription.
review/text: My two small dogs took to the food immediately so well in fact I have had to move up the subscription for the 12 pound bag. Since they are young its not immediate if they look healthier or bouncier as they seem to be that way all the time. What I have noticed is there business is allot more controlled and any problems such as regurgitation which I had in past products have gone away. If your a prime member I would suggest setting up a subscription and be rid of of the chore of last minute runs to buy dog food and also know you are giving your pets a quality tier of dog food.

review/summary: first rate dog food
review/text: Newman's Own has been an excellent choice for my dog. The ingredients are organic and high quality; her coat is beautifully conditioned and she has never had an allergic response as with some of the more expensive products from the vet's office. Also, she is a small dog and the kibble bits are easy for her to chew.  It was annoying that the price was reduced between the time of my order and the delivery, but Amazon made an immediate adjustment.  I like the 4-pound bags for freshness because my dog is small and takes awhile to eat that much, but there are other sizes available to suit larger dogs.

review/summary: My dog loves it!
review/text: I have a 3 year old Boston Terrier who is not only a picky eater, but most dog foods give him bad gas.  I searched high and low for several months for a dog food that would help with his stomach issues and finally found another brand of dog food that, while not organic, helped relieve the gas problem.<br />After finishing a bag of the old brand, I stumbled across this on amazon one cold day and thought I'd take a chance and see if he'd like it or not.  I'm happy to report that he loves it AND it doesn't give him horrible gas at all.  His coat is shiny and healthy, as well.  The only downside I can see--like the other brand--is the price.  But being that the product is high quality and organic, I can't argue that too much.  Plus, with amazon's subscribe and save, I get it at a discount and delivered right to my front door.  You definitely can't beat that!<br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with this and will continue to purchase.

review/summary: so good even a dog does not turn its nose up at it.
review/text: I bought this dog food initally because I like everything that I have tried from Newmans Products for humans. So, I thought that my Pug, Chloe may like Newmans also. Well, she sure does, there is no turning up her nose at it. I get it delivered regualry, so this negates the need to make a special trip to get Dog food.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/12/15  the last two bags I recieved had a mite in the foods which caused my dog to have severe bouts of diarrhea. I only found out today when I took her to the vet, and was informed that these intestinal bugs were usually located in the dog food. Sure enough, when I got home and looked in the dog food, guess what I cfound on the bottom of the bag, tiny mites.......it went out into the garbage containers.<br /><br />I will return to this dog food in a few months......she ahs liked it so much, but will wait for a bit.

review/text: and I love buying it for her. Not only is it a healthy organic meal, I personally like what the Newman Foundation does with their profits (after taxes) from their products.....$265 MILLION has been donated to various charities to date by their foundation. I buy Newman's Own products whenever I can (their spaghetti sauce is out-of-this-world..."Roasted Garlic"...YUM!).<br /><br />My dog has eaten this food for years and years until, out of the blue, my local grocer decided not to sell it anymore. I then had to grab a bag of food for her because we were out completely and decided to get Beneful. Apparently, her digestive system didn't like it and she ended up with bloody stools. That's when I came to Amazon.com (a GODSEND for people like me who have lame grocery stores to shop from) and found her Newman's Own dog food! I can always depend on Amazon.com. I've now got this on auto-delivery. I trust Newman's Own products and I know my dog is getting a well-balanced organic meal and it's Melamine-free.

review/summary: Best Dog Food Ever!
review/text: Newman's Own is the best dog food ever, in my opinion. My 12 year old white German Shepard eats and digests this food wonderfully. Before changing to this food a few years ago, she had digestive problems often, even though she was fed a "so called good brand name food".  My three year old pittie girl also eats this food, and loves it .. she is in perfect health. I would recommend it to anyone. My next door neighbor orders it now from Amazon for his pittie girl. Amazon is a wonderful place to purchase dog and cat food, groceries, and anything you need .. the prices are always good, and the specials are great! The specials are the best ever, and I was shocked to find out that a today "Friday" special price on Newman's Own dog food was automatically reflected in my subscribe and save item price of the Newman's Own.  Even though I just received a bag yesterday, I ordered two more today, and some Newman's Own cat food.  What other retailer would automatically do that for you .. none that I know of.  Amazon .. please continue to offer the Newman's Own dog food .. I would be lost without the delivery, since it is difficult for me to get out and shop and carry large items like bags of dog food.  Thank you for being here for me and Snowey and Sophie.<br />  Linda

review/summary: Great for dogs with allergies
review/text: I was giving my dogs Science Diet Puppy food from the time I got them at 8 weeks. Science Diet changed the formula about 3 months ago and the food just did not smell or look right. It was very oily and fishy smelling, which I realize they did at more fish oil. After about three weeks of the new food, I noticed my puppies (well now 1 year olds) skin was very flaky like dandruff and they both had been continuous licking their paws. I took them to the vet and he said they had food allergies. He wanted me to take them off the Science diet and put them on pumpkin and pinto beans for 7 weeks. Well, under duress I tried it and my dogs did not eat for 3 days. I decided to try the Newman's organic and after about 4 weeks their coat looks so much better and the licking has really decreased. I am so glad I saw this food when I was doing research.

After only 2 months the subscription price had increased by almost 40%!!  No notice on the increase was sent to see if I still wanted it either.

review/text: I've never had an allergic reaction to any food, or anything else, in my life.  But within 20 seconds of starting to chew a piece of this gum, my throat began to burn and my airway became constricted.  That's strange, because I've been chewing spearmint and peppermint ice cubes for a while now with no reaction.  I "tasted" another piece from another pack (we get this stuff free at the dining facility here in Iraq), and again, my throat started burning.  So, if you have a history of food allergies, you might not want to try this flavor.

review/summary: Tasty and Healthy Snack
review/text: Our family loves these tasty and healthy sesame honey almonds by Trader Joe's.  You get the crunchy flavor of the sesame seeds combined with the subtle sweetness of the honey and almond flavoring.  Wow--it's a great snack that you feel good while eating.  It is my favorite of Trader Joe's almond snacks.  Almonds are good for you and a handful of these in the morning with a fruit smoothie or as a snack at lunch is a great way to get protein, the healthy fat and the Vitamin E that almonds offer. It's a good idea to measure out 1/4-1/2 cup of these almonds or count the almonds out to stay in the calorie range you want to keep within. Nutritionist recommend having a small amount of almonds or walnuts each day for good fat and protein.

review/summary: Acceptable & inexpensive, but GREAT when cold brewed!
review/text: After becoming more and more a "coffee person", I've been trying various brands and flavors in an attempt to figure out which one I prefer. I've tried other brands such as Dunkin', Kirkland, and various other store brands. I came across a great deal on a 3 pack of Community Coffee so I decided to try it. The packaging isn't the best once you open it, but I have separate air tight containers which I use (as I imagine most coffee drinkers would own).<br /><br />I prefer dark/bolder roasts, and I found that Community Coffee definitely fit the bill. My girlfriend didn't like it, claiming it was too strong, which further reinforced my belief that it was at the right level for me. I brew the coffee the traditional way (coffee pot), but also via cold brewing. I've found that the cold brewed version of Community Coffee far surpasses the traditional, heat-brewing product. I'm not quite sure if this is the case for almost all coffees, but it seems even more pronounced with Community coffee.

review/summary: Hazelnut coffee smells and tastes like Buttered Popcorn not as much like Hazelnut
review/text: This coffee was good but it had a distinctive aroma and taste like buttered movie theater popcorn. I am a huge hazelnut flavored coffee fan and this was good, It just doesn't typically taste like hazelnut. You may like it but I will search for a more true hazelnut flavor. Do a test, make popcorn in the microwave and then later make the coffee and you will see the similarities.

review/summary: Community Hazelnut Coffee
review/text: Very pleased with this new coffee, thanx to another user comment and good review from someone recently when I was searching for a better priced coffee. Plus more importantly the price so far is still excellent; all the others are ridiculous on pricing I have noticed, increasing by $4 or $5 in some cases.  I was getting Maxwell House Hazelnut, but this coffee is much tastier; and Maxwell House has gotten way too pricey for the quality of their hazelnut after experiencing Community's bolder flavored hazelnut.  You can actually taste Hazelnut in Community Coffee.  It's a bit bolder, but I like a good cup of coffee where you can actually taste the coffee (yeah).  I do not buy or search for Maxwell House any longer, nor do I enjoy Folgers or any of the much more expensive brands as none of them compare to the rich flavor of Community Hazelnut Coffee.  I just hope that now, finally after finding a decent tasting coffee at a good price, Amazon keeps it in stock for awhile.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

It goes well with milk and Splenda, no odd aftertaste whatsoever.  Donut shop is my favorite over ICE, Newman's Nantucket is my favorite BOLD, Timothy's Italian goes best with dessert, and Colombia Excelencia is the first thing I drink every morning.

I only paid $2.50! the only difference is that I didn't get tea bags they were dissoluble cubes you place in the hot water. It worked great. It took a few hours to work but it worked!. The next day I had my voice back completely and no sore throat. One night I woke up from terrible post nasal drip cough, took a cup of this tea and it eliminated the cough and put me right to sleep. A must buy, its cheap and natural. You cant go wrong if you give it a try.

review/text: Its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed.  I don't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants.  This is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work!  I have not tried it during a sinus migraine yet but for moderate congestion it works wonders.  Smells a bit off but the taste is just fine.  Make sure to seep it for 10-15 mins or it won't work.  Give it about 10-20 mins to kick in.  Seems to last for 3-4 hrs.  No side affects that I can tell.  So glad to be rid of the racing heart side affect and dry mouth/ sore throat that comes with sudafed.  It works great paired with a sinus rinse or netty pot.

review/summary: didn't work for me
review/text: After reading all the great reviews, I optimistically ordered some of this tea. I've had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success.  Unfortunately, this really didn't do anything for me.  The taste is OK (bearable), but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion.  (So far the only things I've found that have helped me somewhat are the Vicks personal warm mist humidifier and Neti Xlear)

review/text: I have been suffering from post nasal drip and congestion for so many years, and this tea made such a big difference after a couple of days. I drink it 1-2 times per day and I feel so much better. I can breathe easier, and have little or no post nasal drip throughout the day.

review/summary: Benefit hard to determine
review/text: I've suffered from recurrent bouts of acute sinusitis that have only become worse and worse over the years. Every time I get an infection, my right maxillary sinus swells up like a balloon. Sleeping at night on account of this condition is terribly difficult; I often have to resort to using Afrin to decongest my sinuses, which is effective but also very painful and not a realistic, long term solution because of rebound congestion. Now I already irrigate with a motorized system, often upwards of 8-10X daily when I'm sick, and drinking herbal tea has also become a pasttime to help cope with my sinus disease. That being said, I bought this tea out of sheer desperation. I'll try (and have tried) next to anything to give myself some relief while I wait for antibiotics to take effect. The only thing which I find works even close to as well as Afrin is to megadose on Psuedoephedrine (240 1-2 times per day), which is something that is also unsustainable. So, keep in mind that the severity of my sinus condition is drastic. What I found with this tea is that it seems to help, but I can't tell whether or not it works any better than domestic teas that tout similar claims (Yogi's Breathe Deep and Cold Buster, Celestial Sleepytime Sinus Soother, and other respiratory-aiding herbal formulations). I've brewed it double-strong to try and gain the greatest effect, and again, it seems to work modestly but nothing amazing. The taste is a little bitter, but I suppose that's a fairly reasonable indicator it has beneficial compounds in it. All in all, I am likely to stick with the less exotic teas that I can buy at the grocery store. As an aside, I find Celestial's Sweet and Spicy herbal mix to have probably the best mucus thinning effect out of all the teas I've tried, though it's not at all marketed as something for this purpose. If you read everything they put in it, though, it makes sense that it would help.

review/summary: No effect for this sinus sufferer
review/text: I bought this tea during a major sinus infection crisis which included headache, earache, toothache. I drink multiple cups over a few days, and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect. Taste is so-so, but that's not really what matters. As every sinus sufferer knows, if eating dirt would make the pain go away, we'd eat dirt.

review/summary: Have to make the tea strong.
review/text: I am having to change my original post on this tea. My husband and I both suffer from sinus problems. I made up a big tea pot (with 2 tea bags) and let it steep for 15 minutes. I had 2 cups and my husband had one. Neither of us noticed any difference with our sinuses. A few days later I decided to try the tea again. I brewed one cup of tea with one tea bag. I let it sit again for several minutes. I guess the first time I tried it I did not make it strong enough. This time I noticed a difference as my sinuses are a little clearer.

review/text: I learned about these from a co-worker after he made a bulk purhcase of several kinds of beef sticks a year ago.  He spread them around and so I got to sample a variety: I've ordered the Honey Stung four times since then. Two other co-workers have also ordered them on several occassions this past year and they're "believers" too.  Additionally, we've all ordered several of the Buffalo Bills brands and they're all superb!  As long as you don't eat the whole bag, I'd also call these "Atkins friendly" as well, as that is also a motivator for me ordering these so many times (other than them being just being great, well-seasoned snacks).  Buy 'em, you'll love 'em!

review/text: I was a little skeptical on ordering the teriyaki sticks version based on a couple of reviews but, I am happy I did. They were a soft stick as someone said but had a nice crunch when you bit in. The teriyaki was milder than others I have ordered and they were more smokey but they are called ole' smokeys. I did not get the greasy mouth feel that someone said and it did have a pleasant tasting after taste. All in all, worth a 4* rating... but it could be a 5 based on individual tastes.

I will buy them again and will recommend them to friends and family.

I also loved the texture, it was very soft and tender.<br /><br />The only bad thing I'd have to say about this product is that it leaves me with a very greasy, fatty residue all over the rood of my mouth, which kind of takes away from the flavor and my ability to FULLY enjoy the product. Aside from that, I may still order it again. :)

review/summary: Honey Beef sticks in saddlebag packaging
review/text: I like this product very much. The Honey flavor makes them taste very good and they are bigger and thicker than most others I've seen. The saddlebag package is ingenious. why open and expose to the air all 100 when you only have to open half at a time. leave one half (50) completely sealed. One package of 100 thick beef sticks can sustain someone for a very long time. Use for emergency shelters,mountain climbing ,backpacking, camping, hiking, survival training, or any survival situation.theres plenty (100), so you could sustain yourself a long time if lost.Just these very light storable beefsticks and a jar of peanut butter unopened and a large jug of water in a vehicle could sustain life for a very long time at a minimum of space and weight.They appear kind of home made, unlike any beef sticks I have seen in stores before. My dogs like them also.I break off 1/2"pieces whenever they need a treat. I see nothing in the ingredients that suggest dogs can't eat them.However I want each person to evaluate this on their own not just because I say so. My 5 dogs have had pieces of them now and then and love them and havent shown any signs of being sick or having less energy. I recommend them.

review/summary: Good, Just not what I was looking for
review/text: I couldn't resist the price... so many beef sticks for so cheap. However, I think I was expecting something different. The jerky has a good taste, and at first it wasn't very oily, but as they got older (and exposed to the air) I did notice some oil spots forming through the casings of the sticks. Overall, if you can consume this, say, within 1 week of opening, they are great! If you need something that will stick around longer (stick, get it?) then maybe this isn't the right product. They also sent me a free sample of some of their other products with my order, and the shipping was quick. I like the company, the beef sticks just weren't what I was looking for, I guess.

review/text: This wine actually turned out really well.  I made some modifications to the kit however.  If you figure out the potential alcohol content, this kit would probably get around 7%, but by adding additional sugar at the primary fermentation, I ended up with 13%.  I also didn't use the whole f-pack.  It would have been WAY to sweet.  Instead, I topped the carboy off with an unoaked Chardonnay that I like.

review/summary: "Did you really make this?"
review/text: I have now made a few of the Amazon wine kits. The Cornucopia are all fruity flavored sweet wines. Within a month of bottling the Pear Chablis our 30 bottles is down to 6 remaining. We have given as gifts and taken to get togethers. My only negative comment is that the starting Specific Gravity is low therefore these are lower alcohol wines. I did add a couple cups of sugar to the fermenter at the beginning...but worried that adding too much sugar would throw off the flavor of the wine. Anyway, the Pear Chablis is a nice easy drinking wine. It has an attractive label. I used clear bottles and the final product looks sharp.<br />If you are looking for straight wines that are not sweet fruit flavored wines, check out the Vino Italiano kits. These also come with corks, foils, and labels. They are a higher alcohol wine than the Cornucopia kits with a starting SG closer to 1.090.

review/summary: Great Wine!
review/text: Just bottled this wine about 2 weeks ago.  Opened the bottle yesterday, and WOW!!  I can't believe how good it is. Lots of pear flavor, and having experience with this brand, I know that when I let it sit for a couple months, it will be much better. The sweetness mellows out a little, but still is great! I have made about 6 of the Cornucopia wines, all with good results.  If you like the sweeter wines, you have to try this!
