review/text: I have four small-to medium size best canine friends.  They absolutely adore Cesar and turn their noses up at anything else.  I am especially grateful to Cesar in one respect.  A year ago, we rescued an elderly Pom who had been fed nothing but table scraps which meant her teeth were ruined.  It took a while to get her to eat actual dog food.  She licks the dish clean now, thanks to Cesar!

review/summary: Scoop Away Wins at Clumping
review/text: A few months ago, I decided to do my own independent testing of major clumping litters in search of one that would work best for my cats.<br /><br />Methodology:<br />2 cats<br />4 litter boxes<br />1 month with daily scooping.<br /><br />Products tested (avg 20lbs per litter box):<br />Tidy Cats Power Blend<br />Tidy Cats Instant Action<br />Arm and Hammer Super Scoop, Fresh Clean Scent<br />Scoop Away Fresh Scent<br /><br />Results:<br />Scoop Away won hands down at clumping even after a month. Where the others would eventually start to break apart into small pieces, Scoop Away, as the box describes, "clumps tight" and rarely did so. However, it loses a point for being dusty out of the box and its obnoxious perfumey smell. I could always tell when one of my cats had been to the little box. The perfume would waft behind them. Though, I suppose that was better than the alternative.<br /><br />Tidy Cats, my staple for years, had the least obtrusive odor and was the least dusty from the start. However it, never clumped as tightly as the others. After about a week and a half, the resulting clumps broke apart easily. The Power Blend (aka Premium Scoop) was a huge disappointment. It didn't perform anywhere near as well as the Instant Action (aka plain old Scoop). Its clumps started to break apart within days. Although not a part of this test, I've noticed in the past that Tidy Cats Small Spaces, another "Premium Scoop" also never performed as well the regular scoop.<br /><br />Arm & Hammer clumped well, but was perfumey and very dusty the entire time.<br /><br />Cats' opinion:<br />None. They didn't seem to favor one over the other.

review/summary: Hernia Inducing Cat Litter
review/text: I used Fresh Step and Scoop Away cat litters for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that they were the best "bang for the buck" litters. They clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, they form a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase one of these litters. Both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!

review/summary: Nicky Beans Kona Coffee Muai Coffee Roasters
review/text: I seldom enjoy Kona coffee because it is so expensive.  But it is outstanding coffee.  I prefer whole beans that I grind myself just before brewing, using a burr grinder set on coarse.  Then I carefully brew it using a French press with hot water between 180 and 200 deg. F.  Then, after four minutes brewing, I pour a cup, add a touch of fresh cream, and I am set!<br /><br />This Christmas while visiting Hawaii, my sister-in-law bought a pound to give to me.  What a nice surprise!  But when I ground the coffee I got a tremendous amount of chaff.  It made a mess in our kitchen, blowing all over the counter and floor!  Having roasted my own coffee beans at times, it appeared to me that either the chaff was not removed during roasting and processing, or the beans were not roasted properly.  The taste of the Kona coffee was flat and disappointing.  Buyer beware; make sure you can get it returned or replaced if you are not satisfied.

review/summary: My doxie on Royal Canin
review/text: This is the best ever dog food.  It has no chemicals, fillers, bad fats, or artificial flavors, etc. It is totally natural and healthy.  It smells so good when I open the bag, I want to eat it myself. My miniature dachshund is 5.5 years old and my very close companion.  Whenever I am out with him, people fall in love with him. Consequently, he has many ardent admirers so he is a happy, healthy, well adjusted hound.  Everyone tells me how shiny his red coat is, how calm and well behaved he is, and how well I take care of him.  He is the best spokesperson and living testimonial for Royal Canin specially formulated dog food for dachshunds.<br /><br />Recently, the store was out of his Royal Canin so I bought another leading brand of dog food. For one month, that is what he ate.  He showed me over and over that he didn't like it as well, but the real proof of how good the Royal Canin diet was for him became evident in that month when he didn't eat it.  He became a bit dejected rather than his usual, full of life and upbeat self. Even more evident was that during this time of being off the Royal Canin, his coat and ears became dry and dull.  His back coat was coarse when I stroked him.  He became a little less interested in life.<br /><br />Now that he is back on the Royal Canin he is better than ever.  It's like he appreciates the food I give him even more.  Each morning he jumps straight up high in the air in anticipation of my bringing his dish of Royal Canin to him.  His red coat has returned to its rich luster and his ears are satiny soft once more.  I will never feed him any other kind of dog food again.

review/summary: Take care of your best friends!
review/text: My two dachshunds have been on Iams, Blue Buffalo, and now Royal Canin. I recommend Royal Canin above all. They absolutely love this food. I buy the 10 pound bag every two months, and order with the free shipping. They ate the Iams, but I can say they really look forward to this food. Blue Buffalo gave them very runny stool, and it made my boy dachshund itch like crazy! It's $30 and it lasts me two months feeding two dachshunds. I definitely spend more money than that on food for myself, and we should take care of our friends with a high quality dog food. They're worth it!

review/text: I am trying to cut corners where I can and this purchase saved me about $9 overall.  Those of us with pets know how hard it is to find pet food for our "babies' so when we do discover a food that is nutrious and our pet loves it we hesitate to change.  Dog food has gone up in price (as everything has)so when I found my brand at Amazon I decided to give it a try.  The food was fresh, arrived in two days with Prime shipping and I couldn't be happier.  Saved a few dollars on the cost, no tax, and no driving.  I will purchase this again.

review/summary: Our three wieners love it
review/text: We were using the Costco house brand, as it assays well and our dogs liked it.  But they were putting on pounds.  A friend's vet had recommended the Royal Canin to her, and her dachshie was the shiniest, glossiest dog I've ever seen.  We switched, and our dogs are now similarly shiny and beautiful.  They love the food, too-- although they like the Costco stuff even more, just like teenagers like junk food.<br /><br />I'd rank the Costco stuff a 6 or 7 on a scale of 10, meaning not-terrible but not great either (but a good value).  The Royal Canin, by comparison, is a solid 10, if a bit pricey.  Worth it, though... our dogs mean a lot to us.

review/summary: Best.Dog food.Ever
review/text: I had always fed my dachshund high quality food, but if I didn't buy the weight-control formula, he would pack on pounds, which was not good since he has had back problems.  When the pet store was out of my normal food, I bought this thinking "hey, if it's more expensive it must be good."  He had never been a huge eater, but he attacked this food.  Loves it.  And the weight dropped off him and he looks great.  My vet verified that this was very good food (if I wanted to pay for it).  He (and my new dachshund) have been on the food for months, and have never been healthier.  I completely trust this food, and it's all I will buy them now.  Amazon has the best price I've seen and with free shipping saves me a monthly trip to the pet store.

review/summary: Fantastic dog food
review/text: My dachshund is a rescue who was beaten and neglected by a puppy mill for 5-6 years. He's got a huge scar on his head where they burned him and when I got him, he had an issue in his blood work that indicated he had some liver issues that were minor. Also, his coat was rather rough in that his fur was not soft at all. Within 2 months of feeding him this food, his fur cleared up. Now after 3 years of feeding him this food, his liver indications in blood work are gone. It's by far the best dog food out there for dachshunds.

That flavored liquid stuff and powered stuf just doesn't cut it... so these are the PERFECT ticket when you don't hav a place to refrigerate the store-bought stuff.  The only reason it didn't get more stars is the indicated "Shelf-life" date.  It's like 2 months after purchase.  With the UHT method and no refrige-needed, I cannot understand why this isn't more shelf-stable longer??  I plan on keeping it in a sporadically used kitchenette, an ofice setting is perfect, so I hope it lasts longer than the 2 months.  I wish Lo'L would include some printed information regarding why the short life in the package, but alas, nothing.<br />Otherwise, good stuff!

They do a fine job creaming coffee, are real dairy (with only a couple relatively innocuous additives), and keep well for a few months.

review/summary: Mini Moos
review/text: The product arrived several days after the date I had been told it would arrive. The outer packing box was damaged. The inner box, the Mini Moos box looked as though it had been opened and taped back shut with clear packing tape. When looking in the box, it was obvious that several of the Mini Moos has had been opened, or broke in transit as the inside of the box was sticky and rather messy. The count on the box read 188 but in reality there were only 160 and that was including the empty containers. While checking it out, we also discovered the sell by date was more than three months ago.he inner box with the product looked as though it had been opened, the sell by date had already passed and many of the Mini Moos had either been opened or broke open in transit and spilled all over the box. Although we like Land-o-Lakes products this was a disappointing mess.

review/summary: Ok pancakes, but not very "pumpkiny"
review/text: I was excited to find pumpkin pancake mix online, and promptly ordered this four pack from Village Mixes. For pancakes, they're fine, not too different than your standard Bisquik pancakes. The chocolate chips are present in the perfect quantity, not too few, not too many, and they taste good. However, the mix is really lacking in the pumpkin flavor its advertised as. In fact, if the box didn't have a sticker on it that said pumpkin, I would have figured it was just plain. Also, there is no nutritional information for the pumpkin blend on the box (just for other types, like plain, blueberry, etc.). In all honesty, I will stick with Trader Joe's pumpkin pancake mix from now on. Its cheaper, and actually has pumpkin flavor. If you're looking for just regular pancakes (not pumpkin flavor), go ahead and order this.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I only recently started making couscous when I discovered this Israeli type. I love this stuff, it looks quite similar to acini di pepe, but has a lovely bite and texture quite different from your regular small pasta.<br /><br />However, it isn't terribly nutritious having no appreciable amounts of calcium or iron, it's basically just pure carbs. But it is a good base to build a dish on. I usually end up with celery, garlic, onion/shallot/leek, fresh parsley, broccoli/cauliflower, zucchini and chicken/pork. I've even used pak choi. Pretty much any fresh veg you add will pair up great. Funnily enough, I've never actually made it plain as a side dish.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying it out if you're in a rut with your regular starchy side dishes.

Enjoy!<br /><br />So 12 boxes is a "healthy supply," but you will not find this product cheaper anywhere else.

review/summary: Tony Chachere's Butter & Herb Rice Mix
review/text: This rice is mildly flavored.  The buttery taste depends upon how much butter you add to the mix.  Since we eat a low to moderate amount of fats, I added less than the directions stated and received no complaints.  The dominant herb flavor is  that of white pepper which, since I don't eat hot or spicy foods, came as a bit of a surprise to me and caused me to cough.  However, members of my family who eat spicier foods than I barely, if at all,  noticed the peppery flavor.<br /><br />Overall it's a nice white rice side dish with mild creole flavoring.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I ordered Auricchio Imported Provlone (1 lb including shipping $20.00). I was concerned about the excessive heat and immediately sent an email to the seller questioning the shipping mehtod used.  The seller never responded to my email.  The cheese arrived wrapped in paper and had the consistancy of Swiss Cheese not hard as an Imported Provolone should be.<br />I called the seller to complain thinking I did not receive Provolone Cheese. The seller insisted it was Provolone and not Swiss Cheese, He was not very empathic to my concerns. He told me to put the cheese in the refrigerator to harden. The cheese was comprised. It was provolone as stated, however, I would think the seller would know that an item like that should have been shipped over night or at least with dry ice. If he had responded to me and addressed my concerns perhaps the item could have been shipped properly.  I would not order from this seller again. He did give me an option to return the item at my expense. I decided rather then spend another $6.00 S&H (total for 1 lb chesse not eaten $26.00) it was more cost effective just to throw it out. I now hesitate ordering cheese online especially in the summertime.

review/text: I have been looking for something a little different to spice my meats with and this does the trick. I have used it on pork chops and chicken, but so far my favorite is using it on chicken quarters with some garlic salt and extra pepper. Let the chicken set overnight and bake in the oven. The spices make the skin of the crust so yummy!

review/summary: Love the Rub with Luv
review/text: We got this jar of rub from my daughter who lives in Seattle and tried it on the chicken when we put it on the grill. Our group of ten guests who ate the chicken kept asking what we used and said it was the best grilled chicken they had ever tasted.<br />It is good and we highly...highly recommend it. I can't eat really spicy food, but this is not overly spicy, but extremely flavorful and tasty.

review/summary: Decent flavor but very, very mild
review/text: I used this 12-spice mix when I whipped-up an improvised cashew butter sauce for a Chinese dish.  I started by adding a small amount of the powder, but I couldn't detect much flavor in the resulting sauce.  I kept adding more and more powder until I could finally taste it.  The end result was OK, but just keep in mind that you may need to use a lot of the spice mix to adequately flavor your dish.

review/summary: Best diet keeper secret.
review/text: I guess this is a secret.  This is great at keeping the diet that you are currently on.  You get the sensation of a complete meal, like spaghetti, or any other meat with sauce that needs a noodle.<br /><br />These have no flavor but pick up whatever they are being cooked with.<br /><br />It is so hard to find these noodles.  I travel to my local health food store to get them.  I might just get them from the Sea Tangle website, which is much cheaper than advertised here.  $33/12-12oz.

review/summary: Wow! Noodles!
review/text: I generally avoid most pastas, preferring the zucchini noodles or spaghetti squash as gluten free alternatives instead of rice noodles or other gluten free options. These are such a nice surprise! I only bought them because they were on sale at our local health food store (two 12-oz. bags for $5.00). Admittedly when I took them out of the bag, I wasn't too certain about them. The texture is a little odd straight out of the package. I rinsed them with water and then made a tahini, almond butter, tamari, rice vinegar, sesame oil, adzuki bean miso, and coconut sugar sauce to pour over them. I had to massage the sauce into them a bit with my hands. Then they softened up into reasonable nicely textured noodles. I topped it with thinly sliced cucumber, carrots and chopped almonds. Mmmm! They are very high in calcium, and with the tahini sauce, it's a calcium fest. Granted, I can't very well see how they're considered "raw." They hardly look like any kelp plants I know. Some processing had to take place somewhere along the way. I am happy to have found them to satisfy my occasional craving for something that's a little more genuinely noodle-y. Hooray!

review/text: These have a really nice texture, crispy-bouncy, and no odd flavor.  My husband and I prefer them to shirataki.  A LOT.  They are very low carb, did not budge my blood sugar!<br /><br />Better for salads or Asian dishes, I do not think I would like them in place of spaghetti.  I use spaghetti squash for that.<br /><br />I only gave them 4 stars because they may seem deceitful to some people.  There is a video criticizing them for being "processed," not truly raw, on youtube.  Doesn't bother me --  I am low carber, not a raw foodist.

review/summary: What does it take? They never got soft!
review/text: I bought these from a local store -- same brand, same size -- and tried using them tonight. Though there was water in the package, they were dry. These noodles had the texture of wood shavings or hay. My first thought was a Hijiki (seaweed), cucumber and kelp-noodle salad. I soaked them for half an hour, expecting them to soften, but without success. Then I put the container in the microwave and heated the water to boiling and let them sit in the hot water for maybe 20 minutes, until the water was room temperature. Still dry and crunchy. I tried a recipe on the back next, exactly as written. No luck. What does it take to soften these things? More than an hour in liquid, plus heating, should have done something!<br />Some will say I should not give a poor review because I can't get them to turn into noodles.Well, consumers need to know what problems other consumers have had,so they can make valid decisions (or make fun of me, whatever works!).<br />This is probably a case of operator error. Or maybe I got a bad batch. I expected them to soften like rice noodles, but maybe with the texture of shiritake noodles.<br />I would love to know more details of others' experiences with these noodles. I don't know what I did wrong. The noodles are not cheap, and I hesitate to buy them again based on my experience. I would not recommend these noodles to anyone else, either, because I couldn't get them to become soft.

review/text: Ordered this at an Italian restaurant to go with some chicken spiedini Oscar (seafood and alfredo).  I love a good Riesling, but it is sometimes hard to find at a restaurant.  This wine was crisp and slightly sweet, a great companion to the shrimp and scallops that topped my chicken. Served nicely chilled, I feel this wine would go nicely with many light to medium dishes.  I highly recommend, and will be purchasing a case for my own wine cellar.

review/summary: Cats doing very well on this food
review/text: My cats have eaten Natural Balance dry since they've been kittens and of all the foods I've tried, this is the food they enjoy the most and their health has been perfect. Shiny coats, clear eyes, no allergy problems or health problems of any kind. My only vet bills have been for annual exams and vaccinations. I've recently added Natural Balance canned to their diet and I'm happy I did. They both love the food and seem a little more satisfied than with only feeding the dry food. I feel good about feeding them a food with high quality ingredients and the reduced calorie formula is great for my cats since they're strictly indoor and one of them tends to put on a little weight on regular calorie food. I'd recommend this food to anyone who wants to give their cats the best food for their health.

review/summary: Good food, but marginal quality
review/text: If you are a farmer with lots of farm cats, this is the perfect food - and because it is primarily sold at most farm and fleet stores I think that it is meant for farm cats. The ingredient list is marginal quality though, which can be expected. Most of it is corn and grain products, with a few meat by-products here and there. Better than Iams but not by much.<br /><br />I've been feeding my cat on Diamond Maintenance for 2 years without a problem but I will be switching to something with more substance soon. If you're looking for a cheap option for lots of cats, this is a good product to buy in bulk; but if you have a domestic cat you wish to keep around for awhile, I'd suggest something else.<br /><br />And hey, if you're looking for a good alternative, get Chicken Soup For The Adult Cat formula. Great stuff, doesn't cost a lot, and is much better than the regular Diamond food.

review/summary: Thankful for finding this cat food!
review/text: We switched over to this cat food a couple of months ago and my cats are very happy and healthy.  We have 2 indoor cats, 1 indoor/outdoor cat and feed 2 outdoor neighborhood cats, and they are all getting this cat food.  We were spending twice this amount on our indoor cats and feeding the outdoor neighborhood cats meow mix (we also have racoons dipping into the supply) but at this price we can eliminate storing 2 separate large bags of cat food and feed them all the same.<br /><br />The indoor cats love this food, plus they have stopped vomiting on the floor.  The cat box does not have a foul smell, either.  Our cats range from 8 lbs. to 25 lbs., and they all seem to be thriving.  Our extra small, elderly female has no problem with the kibble size and neither does our 25 lb extra large, slightly handicapped male (he had trauma to his head as a kitten - causing him to loose an eye, partial sinus and has had some mouth repair.  We do not know what happened to him, he had been operated on prior to our adopting him from our local animal rescue.)<br /><br />So, in my opinion, this food covers the entire scope of kitties' and their needs.  We are very thankful for finding this food :)

I thought first I received dog food by mistake; re-read the label - no, that's cat food. Wow, way too large for my cats' little mouths. They seem to have fun with it, though - crunching on the pieces (good teeth cleaner at the same time?).<br /><br />However, as two of my cats can be considered seniors, I will have to switch to a different food, something with smaller bits, to make it easier for them.
