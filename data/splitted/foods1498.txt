review/summary: Looking for Butterfinger
review/text: I bought this product because my husband has been raving about a butterfinger coffee that he used to drink while in school.  I have been searching for a good substitute and I found this particular brand on Amazon.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to our expectations.  It didn't taste like butterfingers and the smell was definitely not there.<br /><br />In all fairness, we are not big coffee drinkers but will indulge in a good cup of java anytime.<br /><br />In the meantime...we are still looking for Butterfinger.

review/summary: Absolutely Awesome Taste and Texture
review/text: Since eating Gluten Free, I have tried a lot of different products.  Most are not very tasty!  I do not believe that anything can beat the taste and texture of these biscuits when it comes to being gluten free!  If you are really missing bread - you have to try these!  I have tried so many different bread mixes and may have to live without bread.  I can do that as long as I have these biscuits!  They are awesome!  They also included recipes to make Cinnamon Buns, Sausage Balls, Chicken and Dumplings and Chicken and Biscuits.  You can also use this for Pigs in a blanket or for breakdfast sandwiches.  I have only used them as a biscuit so far and the best biscuit I have ever eaten.  They are also much better then the biscuits made with Gluten Free Bisquick Mix!

review/summary: amazing!
review/text: I've been baking gluten-free and egg-free for six years, and this is my favorite product, hands down. The biscuits are buttery and light, and only need a very short rising. I mix in herbs and sprinkle with coarse salt, for a savory biscuit - or sprinkle with shredded cheese, for a cheese biscuit. A real winner, even with friends and family!

review/text: These truffles were excellent, especially for the ease of buying them through Amazon.  I had been ordering truffles from the west coast, which (the truffle maker said) had to be shipped in dry ice.  The cost of the shipping was higher than the cost of truffles.  We were so pleased when we tasted these truffles---good chocolate, no hassle--thanks!

review/summary: Great deal, and tastes great!
review/text: I got this so I can have some snacks as I study.  The thing I like about this package of 6 is that it has the best price per ounce compared to the other packs, ie. pack of 3 larger ounce jars.  Also as I eat from one jar, the others stay fresh and sealed, unlike larger containers.  Though freshness isn't much of a problem if you do eat these at a decent pace.  When I scanned the UPC with my iphone's RedLaser app, the cheapest price it found was $3.99 each so for 6 it would be $24!  So I really saved quite a bit with Amazon paying only $17.76 and free 2 day shipping, definitely better than being in the crowded Costco!  You can also give these away to friend and family which they will very much enjoy!  The dimensions for each jar is about 5.75" tall x 3.5" wide x 3.75" deep so you can get an idea of the size of each jar, I know it is hard to gauge just with the weight.

review/summary: Fantastic rich nutty flavor and 7 grams of fiber/slice!
review/text: This stuff is absolutely delicious toasted!  Here is how you eat it:  toast it 2 or 3 times on the high setting in your toaster watching it carefully until it just caramelizes on the edges, not burning it.  Then put butter on it which dissolves beautifully when it is very hot and sprinkle with a little Splenda or your favorite jam.  It's out of this world!  And, 7 grams of whole soluble fiber per slice.  Four slices of this and you can quit for the day, it has so much fiber.  I have it for breakfast every day that I do not have steel-cut oatmeal.  That way I start the day off with my fiber.  Fiber has the ability to suck up 15% of the fat in your diet.  It's like natural <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OWN65U">Alli Weight-Loss Aid, Orlistat 60mg Capsules, 90-Count Starter Pack</a> (prescription Xenical) without the pricetag.<br /><br />Brenda Watson and her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416547185">The Fiber35 Diet: Nature's Weight Loss Secret</a> has a whole line of fiber products that Amazon carries.  She should just adopt this bread and put it into the diet.<br /><br />McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal, Traditional, 28-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4) has much more fiber than regular oatmeal.  You just need to soak it overnight or cook it an extra 5 minutes.

review/text: I'm the kind of guy who can eat the same thing often.  So I'm glad to find a convenient way to have 12 loaves of bread which last several months.  It's delicious and hearty, but thin; so it is not too overwhelming.  Great with spinach, mayo (Dukes!), mustard, turkey and swiss.  Once open, wrap and put in fridge.  Holds up good for a solid week.  Will buy again, maybe same variety or try another.

review/summary: bread with guts, flavor, and hardly anything bad
review/text: I've eaten a great deal of Mestemacher pumpernickel over the past several years. It's flavorful and healthy whether you eat it alone, as a sandwich, or toasted. The slices are thin and dense. It's real food, not the kind of bread that keeps something else from getting on your fingers. You have to chew it before you swallow it. In terms of health, this particular brand has no sugar, lots of fiber, and a respectable amount of protein (considering it's just bread). It does contain some whole wheat flour, unlike a competing brand that contains only rye.

review/summary: A tasty Pumpernickle
review/text: Pumpernickle isn't my favorite bread but I do buy this when they're out of the Mestemacher Rye at my local grocer.  It is a dense, heavy bread with a slight sour taste.  My favorite sandwich to make with this?  Liverwurst!  Just a little bit of mayo, mustard and a few hearty rounds from an 8oz chub - and I'm in heaven :).  I really love how neat and square these make my sandwiches - like something you might serve at tea.  You cut the bread in half to make sandwiches since the individual slices are rectangle in shape.<br /><br />I'd like to point out that the ingredients listed by this seller is incorrect.  There is no whole meal wheat flour in this bread.  The ingredients for Mestemacher Pumpernickel (at least according to the package that I currently have) is as follows:<br />Whole Kernel Rye, Water, Wholemeal Rye Flour, Salt, Oat Fiber, Malt Extract, Yeast.<br /><br />Mestemacher also makes a Westphalian version of this bread, aptly named Mestemacher Westphalian Pumpernickle (it comes in a black package).  Personally, I think the Westphalian version has a little more flavor and for those who were disappointed with this version, you may want to give the Westphalian version a try.  It is a separate recipe with different ingredients which are as follows:<br />Whole Kernel Rye, Water, Sugar Beet Syrup, Salt, Malt Extract, Yeast.<br /><br />The only thing I really don't like about these breads is the limited shelf life once opened (5 days, refrigerated).  Though...  it's nice knowing that it's preservative free and truth be told, I've never had a problem going through a loaf in under 5 days (there isn't THAT much bread in each of these packages).  Enjoy!

review/text: It ain't what I remember, from when I emigrated from good ol Germany in 1976. But it is still better than the caramel colored abomination the bakers over here try to peddle as "pumpernickel". Even though it is a far cry from the real westphalian stuff that used to be baked long and slow with the maillard reaction providing the sweetness and caramelization and not some bottle from the laboratory.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the real stuff from a german noble bakery probably fell victim to industrialization, like so many things in this world. Schade.<br /><br />It will still give you a pleasant source of fibre in your bread, but real Pumpernickel it ain't, more like a very heavy KOMISSBROT.<br /><br />Kuechenmeister Kuntze.

review/text: As a child in Baltimore, we bought Pumpernickel from a German Deli in the Lexington Market.  The loaf was about 2-1/2" X 2-1/2" X 9", that you could almost drive nails with.  The flavor and texture was unforgetable.  The baker retired back to Germany, and took his recipe with him.  I've searched for more than 20 years for that bread.  Finally, I came upon the Mestermacher Pumpernickel, and it's like meeting an old friend.  I WILL be keeping an adequate supply on hand, from this time on.

This is the most expensive of the lot, but when you open the can you can actually see the prawns and the flakes of tuna it's worth the extra money.

review/summary: Good snacks for dogs
review/text: These are healthy snacks for dogs, but not something that my dogs just love.  They eat them, but not as quickly as they do ther types of snacks.  I make it a habit to only feed my dogs dog food, no table scraps or people food of any kind.  So they aren't picky eaters, they are used to eating dog food.  My Doberman didn't eat the ones with cinnamon it them at all, but my Schnauzer would eat those after leaving them sitting for a while.

review/summary: Another great product from Blue Buffalo
review/text: Great cookies.  Our dog absolutely loves these and we can give them to him guilt-free knowing they're from blue and made with great ingredients.  They are rather large, so small to medium size dogs may need to have them broken in half or given less frequently.

review/summary: Blue Buffalo Treats
review/text: My two dogs love these.  I'm not 100% sold that I would call these health bars.  I try to give these to the dogs in moderation.  They go crazy whenever I go for the bag.  The bars are pretty big in size there fore there aren't too many in a 16-oz bag.  I've found breaking them in half or quarters makes things last a little longer.  I'll definitely continue to buy these based on how happy the dogs are when they are treated to one.

review/text: Package arrived very quickly and well protected. The only issue I had was that 3 of the chocolate cups arrived mis-shaped. However, I set them in the window for a very short time, and they softened just enough to be moldable. I also think that there was no way to prevent it since the heat wave temperatures were so high the week they were in shipment. I would not have paid for any "overnight" expensive delivery no matter what and any kind of "thermal" packaging would make them too expensive. I recommend these to anyone and will order again.

review/summary: Excellent alternative to regular hamburger buns
review/text: These sandwich thins are a great alternative to bleached, high fructose corn syrup induced hamburger buns for sure. I eat these on top of organic veggie burgers from Amy's, and the taste of the burger mixed with the whole grain sandwich thins is incredible. I'm sure these can be used for multiple other things, even PB+J. The health content in them is exceptional and unlike other buns, you don't have to worry about fishy ingredients. The price in the store I got these from was around 2 dollars, and for these that is a great price.

review/text: I bought a large pack from Costco. While I like that they are low in calories and firm enough to hold any sandwich fillings, I too<br />am growing concerned because it's been over 2 months since I bought this huge pack and they are not getting moldy. Should<br />I be concerned that they come from "Bimbo Bakeries"? - check the label there are a lot of preservatives so I'll probably have to<br />pass on these in the future.

They are great in theory, but I'm becoming pretty alarmed by the fact that it's been over three months and they have shown not even a single bit of spoiling. No mold will grow on them. They look and feel perfect. I don't know about you, but putting something that is virtually un-spoilable in my body is pretty darn scary.

The max amount of juice that babies should drink in a day is 4oz, so I fill up a bottle with equal parts of water and juice and let her drink it with her meals throughout the day. In between I also give her plenty of plain water.

review/summary: My daughter loves this!
review/text: When my much older children were little, Gerber sold a sweet potato juice they loved! Go Vitamin A! Gerber has changed their offerings many times over the years giving this particular item ingredient and name changes. My daughter adjusts to the changes, but will prefer this juice over all others. And now when her friends come over, they leave telling their parents, "I love carrot juice!" Unfortunately fewer and fewer stores are caring the item as the Gerber line continues to change and update . I was so glad to find it still available on Amazon. Try it. I think you will be surprised and your own child's response.

review/summary: Addictive Bread
review/text: I first bought this bread at Whole Foods and loved it.  Then, they had a problem with their supplier and week after week had no bread.  I checked on line and found that Amazon had it, at a price lower than Whole Foods.  So I bought a case (12 packages) and am now on my second case.  It is so delicious --I love the chewy whole rye berries and the thin dense slices.  Every morning I eat a slice with either peanut butter or a slice of good cheddar cheese.  One thing I love about it is that it has a shelf life of 6 months or more.  This is because it is pasteurized after being packaged.  Once opened, it is fine for a week.  If your like whole grain breads, try this--you'll love it!

review/summary: Disappointing unripe black truffles
review/text: 5/15/12:  I received the black truffles I ordered and am very disappointed with them.  They have absolutely no aroma at all and they taste like dirt smells.  RIPE truffles have a wonderful, earthy, garlicky, distinct aroma.  These were void of any aroma at all.  I was really counting on these being ripe when they arrived as I was hosting a dinner party and the menu contained truffle dishes (so I had to completely revise my menu).<br /><br />I contacted the supplier (which took many attempts) and they said their truffle expert (who is currently traveling back from Italy) would need to address the issue.  I am awaiting their response and will finish my review of this product based on their customer service and the end result of the truffles (assuming they finally ripen).  For now, I have rated this item 1 star but will upgrade the rating if warranted.<br /><br />Will update this post when I hear back from the supplier. . . . .<br /><br />5/16/12:  Here's an update. . .<br />Part 1:  After several attempts to contact the supplier (FungusAmongus), I was finally able to get a response after sending an inquiry through their contact webform.  FungusAmongus sent me an email and asked that I speak with their truffle expert (name withheld).  The expert proceeded to tell me that the product was actually a "summer" truffle and that summer truffles don't have a smell or taste.  I know this is absolutely UNTRUE as I have used both summer and winter truffles and both have very distinct and pronounced tastes and aromas (though black winter truffles are "louder").  At any rate, the expert said he would authorize a refund and that I just needed to work out that part with FungusAmongus.  So I left several voice mails, email messages, and even tried to contact them through their own contact webform.  NO RESPONSE.<br /><br />Part 2:  I contacted Amazon's customer service and within 5 minutes they generated a full refund.  PROBLEM SOLVED!<br /><br />FINALLY:  I will never do business with this supplier because their products are very poor, are misrepresented, and their customer service is terrible.<br /><br />Dear Amazon:  thank you SO MUCH for your help in getting this issue resolved and for providing excellent customer service!

review/text: I started drinking this when I was stationed in Korea. It was a quick way to get my morning coffee. It is just enough for one small cup. One stick has instant mocha coffee, powdered cream and a little sweetener. I would add some half&half and a little vanilla flavoring to make it even nicer. My stomach can't handle brands like Nescafe so I was happy to discover I could tolerate this. It is more expensive, of course, to buy it this route. But, sometimes when the craving hits, it's worth the extra cost.

review/text: I was introduced to this coffee several years ago by a visiting scholar from Korea, and I have been drinking it ever since.<br />I used to have a local way to purchase it, but then was forced to start looking online.<br />You don't need to add anything to these little packets, they are already preflavored.<br />I do mix in some flavored creamers from time to time, but you don't have to.<br />I have probably drank over 1000 of these instant packets over the past several years and couldn't reccommend them more.

review/text: This is a delightful jasmine tea, that although an oolong, clearly has the taste and flavor of a green tea.  The jasmine fragrance is delightful while the tea is steeping and while drinking.  I get two infusions from the same pearls and find the tea to be smooth (not at all bitter like another reviewer reported).  While expensive, this is well worth the cost.

I prefer Rishi over Adagio.  But I believe Rishi is a bit more expensive.  So if you want quantity go with this. Quality go with something else.<br />It's OK, just not recommendable.

review/summary: A decent tea.
review/text: The Jasmine Pearl tea from Adaigo is a decent tea. It comes in a pretty little tin that I will use for other teas after I have finished this batch, however, it doesn't really have a great tea taste. It is there, but it isn't strong and it relies heavily on the jasmine to make the experience of drinking it enjoyable. The jasmine is potent, smells great, and indeed as a sweet taste during and after drinking, but it should be an additive to the tea, not the experience.  It was almost like I was drinking jasmine juice or something....unless you oversteep it. It still doesn't have a strong taste, but it is bitter as all hell. This is unusual for something that claims to be a an oolong tea (but would be typical of a green tea.)<br /><br />If you want a good jasmine tea at better price, get some of Numi's stock. Their Jasmine Pearls or Monkey King are both superior and almost half the cost.

review/text: I absolutely love this product. I've been a faithful customer of Fantastic Foods since 1991, and I have always loved these beans. Like all refried beans, they do need salt. But they are seasoned, have a luscious texture and taste fresh - unlike that awful stuff in a can that always has an odd odor and tastes tinny. If you have never tried anything other than the canned, you owe it to yourself to try these refried beans. Did i mention they are ridicously easy? 1 3/4 cup of boiling water and 5 minutes. Perfection.

review/summary: WAY better than canned (Correct preparation instructions included)
review/text: I used to buy this product in bulk from Wild Oats, but haven't been able to find it in several years (Wild Oats was bought out by Whole Foods and the one near me doesn't carry this in bulk). I was so happy to find this product in bulk on Amazon (whether buying 12 7oz. boxes or buying the 3 3.3lb bags which is what I bought). Yes, it's a ton of mix, but I make this so often and it lasts practically forever provided it's kept sealed.<br /><br />The flavor is so far superior to anything canned and, dare I say, even better than refried beans made at home. This is mainly due to the extra flavorings added to the mix whereas home recipes usually only add salt and/or garlic. This product is perfect for anyone who loves refried beans and wants a convenient way to prepare them. I think it's incredible that something this easy and fast to prepare actually tastes better than something you can make at home (that also takes much longer). It's great for quick bean and cheese burritos or breakfast burritos (bean, cheese, and egg with some red sauce) and also great for campers. Plus, if you buy the 3 3.3lb bags, you can divide this product up and make as much or as little as you need.<br /><br />Preparation information:  Many sites I researched for this product said to mix 1.75C boiling water with 1C of mix in a bowl, cover, and let sit for 5 mins.  However, THIS IS INCORRECT and results in runny beans.  I contacted the good folks at Fantastic Foods and was forwarded preparation instructions which are as follows.<br /><br />Pour 1.75C boiling water of 1 1/3C of mix in a bowl.  Stir well, cover and let sit for 5 mins.<br /><br />I haven't tried this ratio yet as I just received the email and wanted to post a review including the instructions since they all seem to be incorrect everywhere I look.  If the beans are still too runny for you, increase to 1.5C of mix and try that.  I personally like my beans very thick for both eating plain and in burritos.

review/summary: GREAT PRODUCT
review/text: If you make the beans per the recipe on the box, just mix some right into any rice and it will make your rice a star.<br /><br />And given that this is a dry product you can use a little at a time which is what I do for rice.<br /><br />I use this product in an unusual way to make the best brown rice.  I needed a way to make the rice more interesting.  It was not enough to just saute some garlic and onions / mushrooms in small amount of water/oil with salt or soy sauce, hot pepper and mix the cooked rice in. That's ok but something was missing.  So during the saute, I put a few of tablespoons of Fantastic Refried bean mix in the liquid, not worrying about proportions because this product cooks up well in just a couple of minutes and I can add more water or boil it off if needed.  Then mix in the cooked rice and this is a very good meal on it's own. The refried beans give this dish lot's of body and flavor.  Everyone I tell about this loves it.

review/summary: Way better than canned!
review/text: I never thought I would love refried beans this much! In the past I had used canned refried beans and they either tasted bland, metallic, or both. A few years ago I discovered these and never used canned refried beans again. They are seasoned just enough, have a great texture when prepared, and never have a metallic taste because they haven't been sitting on some shelf in a can for who-knows-how-long. I use them in burritos, with corn and guacamole,  and even just topped with vegan cheese (Daiya). I don't know what I would do without these delicious beans. The "subscribe & save" option here on Amazon just makes it even better because now I can get them for cheaper than in any store where I've found them. Nutritious, delicious, and cheap - it doesn't get better than this!

review/summary: Great for camping or otherwise
review/text: I wouldn't be w/o this on my Baja kayaking expeditions. When it's my night to cook I put some of the boiled water from breakfast into the dried beans and a dash of EVO, mix and the beans continue to soften in the plastic container until dinner for burritos or whatever. Water is precious in Baja when you are kayaking for 2-3 weeks and this product doesn't seem to need as much H2O as some other dehydrated food.<br /><br />I use this so much I buy it in bulk and keep it in my pantry.<br />It can be added to soups also.<br /><br />This is NOT bland at all. May not appeal to those who enjoy refried beans out of a can which are quite insipid. I doubt that Fantastic could appeal and sell to enough consumers if it went either way in spiciness. IMOA it is JUST RIGHT.

review/summary: Keep them on hand
review/text: I crave bean burritos regularly, I guess there's something in them I need. Great idea to keep a case of Fantastic Food's Instant Refried Beans on hand.  Today I had a package for the day for 780 calories total (of FF Refrieds, that is.) Three mini burritos: soft-taco size wrap tortillas filled with refried, for lunch. For dinner, two big grilled burritos: full size tortillas, fill with refried, fold and cook in skillet of veg spray, flip, makes toasty 'grilled' burrito.  I think this mix is scrumptious!  The texture is just as good as canned, [and not watery like Taco Bell!] and flavorful, salty and seasoned enough and I don't need to add anything.  Fresh home made to compare doesn't enter into this equation because of the cook time, amount needed, inconsistent results of home made and its other variables, LOL...  Anyway,  I may add to FF's refrieds, some brown rice, salsa, chopped tomatoes and onions, picante, chopped fresh spinach, Green Giant mexicorn, vegan 'meats,'  or any other things depending on what I have on hand and hankerin for.  Most often it's been just refried and Tabasco before folding up the burrito.  Hits the spot and fixes that craving very nicely until next time!

review/summary: Delicious alternative tea
review/text: Runa is a brand new tea that I drink everyday. I love the balanced, energizing feel I get from it. Apparently guayusa has been drunk for thousands of years in the rain forests of Ecuador and is now making its way to market in the US for the first time. Runa also seems to have a great back story of environmental conservation and social empowerment of indigenous groups. In fact I just heard a story covered on NPR's Marketplace about the partnership between Runa, the socialist Ecuadorian government and the farmers.<br /><br />The Amazon Spice has a nice cinnamon undertone with high notes from the lemongrass, the Ginger Citrus is also really good and slightly spicier from the ginger with clean citrus zest flavor, the traditional is good to see what guayusa by itself tastes like- smooth and naturally, subtly sweet with no tannin. I've never had the spearmint but I bet its good for people who like mint tea.

review/text: Although I enjoy its flavor, I have never been able to drink coffee because it makes me feel jittery and nervous instead of energetic. Guayusa tea, on the other hand, is a different story, full of pleasure only. Drinking one or two cups of guayusa in the morning gives me energy all day long, without any buzz or jittery feeling. The flavor of this tea is also smooth and sweet, with perfectly balanced hints of cinnamon and lemongrass. It tastes nice hot but I find that I like it best cold.

This stolen was a complete waste of my money (with shipping, almosty $30).<br />The sugar covering was not powdered by a glaze that cracked when I cut it. The cake was dry and tasteless and crumbled when I cut it. I was okay with paying $30 for what I thought would be a good stoeln but this was not good at all. The stolen looks nothing like the picture and was a huge disappointment.My suggestion is, if this is the only stolen you can find, forget about buying one as you will be disappointed.

review/text: I bought several of the food tek items a few months ago, but frankly bought them for emergency situations.  I had not tried any of them until tonight when we wanted corn bread with our soup.  My last gluten free corn bread attempt had been a disaster, so I thought what the heck let's try the food tek cornbread it can't be much worse.<br /><br />It truly was easy to mix, and it cooked up in 1 minute. I toasted the cornbread for just a couple of minutes to give it a more normal oven baked cornbread look.<br /><br />It was sweeter than I would like, but definitely better than I had made from scratch.  My husband does not have to eat gluten free and he said "get some more of these", so I just placed my order for this and several other of the food tek items.<br /><br />If you don't like sweet cornbread, you won't like this.  It is very sweet.

When you want to have something fresh and warm and nothing else is around, this is wonderful to have in the cupboard.<br /><br />The texture is more like angel food cake than corn bread, and it doesn't have nearly the intensity of flavor that real corn bread has, but if you treat it on its own merits without comparing it to other corn breads, it's quite tasty.

review/summary: Favorite granola bar!
review/text: These are delicious! You can really taste the strawberry and they make a great snack or part of my breakfast. They aren't the biggest bars though so I don't find them to be super filling. As far as pricing, if you can get these on sale at your grocery store, then it's pretty similar but you can't beat having it delivered to your front door.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: These actually taste really good, tastes like strawberries and berries and granola and sweet yogurt. No real complaints here, they are tasty.<br /><br />Price here is ridiculous though, I can get these for under $3 at Walmart.

review/summary: Sooooooooooo yummy!
review/text: I just opened a box, and I think this is my new favorite granola bar. You can really taste the berries. It's very sweet, which I love, but it only has 140 calories. It makes for a great snack. Or, add a small piece of fruit and maybe a hard boiled egg for the protein- and you've got a quick breakfast built for those on the go.

review/summary: Backs up the promise of strawberry tastiness...
review/text: It has a nice strawberry flavor, but the frosting drizzle you see in the picture is not what you get on the actual bar.  It is also too sticky.  There is a fine line you can cross with these granola bars and when you cross it, it can become too much.  The gooiness of the bar is a tad offputting at times.  The bar literally sticks to the wrapper and comes apart merely trying to open the wrapper.  That said, I really like the flavor.  Too often these rolled oat bars can taste bland despite any flavor profiles they claim to have.  This actually backs up the flavor it claims to have on the box, and I appreciate that above all else.  Texture may be an issue, but taste is not, which is why this gets four stars from me.  It is also healthier for you than other breakfast bars, and for those of us who like a low calorie snack that is filling, these are bars we can reach for.

review/summary: First Time Buying in Bulk
review/text: These are easily my favorite granola bars. Delicious granola and berries with yogurt drizzled on top. I have one almost every day. They stopped carrying the granola bars at our local stores, so I started ordering packs from here. I'm not much for buying in bulk, but now, I just order more as soon as I have just one box left. It works out quite well.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: They are beyond delicious. A nice strong berry flavor, mixed with granola. You cant lose if you like both. Its sold at Stop and Shop in the organic/health food aisle, but I think this is cheaper here atm.
