review/summary: THE BEST!
review/text: I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.

review/summary: Better than Most Diet Dr. Pepper Knock-Offs
review/text: This flavor isn't EXACTLY like Diet Dr. Pepper, but it certainly isn't *bad*. It's actually pretty good, and a heck of a lot better than most Diet Dr. Pepper knock-offs. Just like pretty much all of the SodaStream syrup flavors, do yourself a favor and buy the assorted smaple-size pack if your SodaStream soda maker didn't come bundled with one already. This way you get to get a good idea of what you, personally, will like because NO TWO PEOPLE ARE ALIKE in their taste preferences...

review/summary: Nothing like the real thing :(
review/text: I love real Dr. Pepper and I enjoy Diet Dr. Pepper.  On a Friday night some people will relax with a glass of wine or beer, I drink a Dr. Pepper.  I was really excited to try the Soda Stream versions but I was so disappointed.  I tried them in the sample pack and wasn't impressed but thought I might be able to acquire a taste for them.  I really like the ingredients in the SodaStream syrups so I wanted to give it a try.  We actually ended up pouring out  most of the Diet Dr. Pete because no one liked it.  Maybe it's just my taste buds because the only SodaStream flavor I really like is the diet cranberry raspberry.  My husband enjoys several flavors but I mostly drink seltzer.<br /><br />If you are looking for a Dr. Pepper double you'll be disappointed.

For now it is a better, greener alternative.

review/text: I wasn't sure I was going to like this - I'd had other Tasty Bite meals and they were all sold out, so I took this, thinking of the lentils my mother used to make, and wondering if it was edible. Now it is one of my favorite Tasty Bites! Its very soupy - you definitely need to eat it from a bowl with a spoon. The taste is just out of this world - perfectly seasoned, rich and creamy - I don't know what it is, exactly but it makes my tongue just dance. I eat them for lunch, sometimes alone or with a vegetable, there isn't a lot in a packet but it's a good side dish size for one person too.

review/summary: Vegan Natural Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. Kosher. Beautiful, classic yellow dal. Dal means lentils which have been split in half, similar to split peas and split pea soup. Yellow dal is a staple of Indian meals (thalis.) Not spicy, but very rich and flavorful. In addition to serving with or over rice, great with bread or toast. Jodhpur is a city in Rajastan, India located southeast of New Delhi. Raja means king. Rajastan is also well known for the high percentage of orthodox Hindu vegetarians living there. Made with lentils, sunflower oil, salt, tomatoes, garlic, cumin, tumeric, and chilis. Easy-open foil pouch. Approx 220 calories, 12g protein, 5g fat per pouch. Labeled vegan on the back of the box. By using only vegetable oils, this wonderful treat also lets Ama Gai [mother cow] save her milk for her own babies. Although freshly and locally made is always better, this Tasty Bite dish is a fantastic tribute to the cuisine of Rajastan and a great choice for everyone to enjoy the wonders of this wonderful Indian cuisine at home. Product of India. Highly recommended. Also really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R9L6K">Tasty Bite Entree, Bombay Potatoes, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006MUF6G">Tasty Bite Entree, Bengal Lentils, 10-Ounce Packet (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/summary: Hearty satisfying and tasty
review/text: I really like the flavor of Jodhpur Lentils. It is soupy but if you let it sit for a few minutes after removing the pouch from the boiling water, it thickens nicely. I serve it over Casbah Couscous. This is something I crave at times and nothing else will do. Our fav Tasty Bite is Jaipur Vegetables, but we also stock this Lentil one as well as the Peas Paneer and Paneer Makhani. I love that the ingredients in Tasty Bite are healthy, and it is great to have Indian cuisine in a convenience food. Amazon sells out of many of these, but you check tastybite for singles and cases, they also have free shipping with $50, which is fine if you buy cases of several varieties.

review/summary: Great "Reasonably" Spicy Jerky!
review/text: I am a long-time fan of beef jerky, since I was a kid reading about its origins.  Too often, commercially available jerky is just so much crap; poor quality, no taste, lousy texture, etc.  Usually, the only good stuff you can find is with small "boutique" (boy, that seems out of place!) vendors, the kind you mind find at good "county fairs".  The only really good jerky I've ever purchased was from Bread & Circus in the early '90s...<br /><br />This jerky is pretty close.  Very good texture (if you like it moist), and little gristle.  Very nice flavor, and some spice - mind you, I really like it hot, so for those who like things milder or moderate, this is probably near or beyond your limits.  The only jerky I know that is hotter is my homemade version using Mad Dog Inferno!<br /><br />Great Product!

review/text: Choo Choo R Snacks Chiptole Habanero Country Cut Beef Jerky is by far the best store bought beef jerky I've tasted!  I love thick cut beef jerky - and the spicier, the better!  They score a AAA+++ from me.<br /><br />USPS really messed up on my shipment of this item, but Choo Choo sent me extra, as an apology for a slow delivery - something they really did not need to do.  Choo Choo is tops in my book!  From a disabled Vietnam Vet, a big THANK YOU!!<br /><br />Alan Hoffman<br />Wyoming

review/summary: Really good jerky, but very salty.
review/text: This jerky has great flavor and a perfect consistency but is quite salty. Its chew is ideal for a tender jerky, it's not overly softened by enzymes to the point of crumbling, yet still retains a bit of a chew so feels like actual jerky. All of the pieces are nicely trimmed and cut against the grain from good quality beef.<br /><br />The flavor is very nice as well, there's a distinct garlic flavor and a solid spicy taste. It's definitely not extremely spicy though, if you aren't phased by Tabasco sauce then this jerky will not be very hot to you. For me, the saltiness of this jerky is considerably more intense than the spiciness. My mouth remains parched many minutes after eating this, so be prepared to drink a lot of water since it's salt content is considerably higher than the average jerky.<br /><br />The saltiness didn't overwhelm too much though so I was still able to experience the really nice flavor and consistency of the meat.  A lot of jerky companies use papaya enzymes to tenderize their jerky, but it tends to make it artificially soft and crumbly, sticky even. Buffalo Bill's does not use these enzymes which I assume is why they are pretty heavy on the salt since it's such a good tenderizer. if they were able to lower the salt and retain the same constancy than this would without a doubt be 5-star perfect jerky.<br /><br />This is still very good stuff though and if you are not too bothered by high salt foods and like a little spice then you should definitely give this a try.

review/text: I don't know how anybody can eat these. I can't taste anything but salt. I hope this is just a bad batch because nobody else in the reviews complained about this being too salty to eat. I gave it two stars because it is just the right tenderness I was looking for. But unfortunately I can not enjoy any of it. I would have returned it and maybe gave this company another chance, but Amazon has a policy that you can't return groceries.

review/summary: Fantastic, and well worth the price
review/text: I bought this jerky for my husband because he loves jerky and spicy food (this one seemed like a no-brainer based on the reviews). To be honest, he was thrown off by the very bright red color when he originally got it and let the jerky sit for a few days while he worked up the courage to try it (bright red, chipotle, habanero, it was a little intimidating). Once he tried it, he fell in love. It's soft, tender, flavorful, not too salty, in essence, in his words, it's like "spicy carne asada, and not the junk, tough carne asada you get at the tex-mex places". It's all he can do to only eat one piece, he loves it!  Well worth the price.

review/summary: Not as the label states
review/text: Let me start by saying this is not really bad jerky.  I took issue to two of the descriptions on the bag.  The first is that this in my opinion is not "HOT".  One would thing that Habanero jerky would at least elicit some type of heat in the mouth, tears, etc.  I did not find that to be the case & was quite disapointed.  I also do not believe this jerky to be very "tender".  The first two pieces I ate almost have the consistency of shoe leather & were very tough to chew through.  I have had purchased more tender jerky at Dollar General.  I will not be buying this again.

review/summary: The Best Of The Habanero Jerkies on Amazon - NOT slap-yo'-mama hot!!
review/text: I ordered all three of the top hits for 'habanero beef jerky' on Amazon. This is far and away the best of the three. The quality of the meat is great. The flavor is complex, and very pleasantly hot. I don't typically go for habanero stuff because I don't go foods that are so hot that you'll slap-yo'-mama. This is the best jerky I've ever had.<br /><br />I typically don't like things with MSG because they make me feel like crap, and this didn't have that effect on me at all, so they must not use much MSG.

Also, in true MSG fashion, the jerky leaves you craving more even when your last bite was not particularly amazing.<br /><br />I'm torn between two stars and three stars. I think I'll stay at three.

review/summary: Hotter than the Spicy One!
review/text: We've been buying the Country Cut beef jerky for almost 2 years.  It's definitely the most moist(and tender on your teeth) of the variations they offer IMO.  As for this, if you are one of those people who love Asian inspired "hot" foods and have no problems with a searing burn in your mouth, the Chipotle Habanero is right up your alley.  If you are one of those people who can drink hot sauce(like Louisiana Hot Sauce) like nothing but want something more spicier, then Spicy is more at your level.  They are not kidding when they call this one Habanero.  It's delicious but HOT!  Be forewarned :P

review/summary: Fantastic product!
review/text: I ordered Buffalo Bills Chipotle Habenero beef jerky for my brother for Christmas.  He's an absolute jerky fiend, but it's hard to find good jerky anymore!  I'm so glad I found Buffalo Bills!  Forget Jack Links or O'berto, which can be dry, tough, and flavorless.  For just a couple ounces of that kind in the store, you'll pay $5 or $6 a bag.  Here, you get half a pound for a great price!  And the quality can't be beat!<br /><br />I haven't tried the Chipotle Habanero that I ordered for my brother (we'll have to wait until Christmas to hear feedback about that), but my boyfriend and I couldn't help but dig into the free sample of cajun jerky they included (a great way to get repeat customers, btw!), and it was wonderful!  So flavorful and chewy.  I had to take the sample away otherwise he would have eaten the whole thing in one sitting.<br /><br />My package arrived within a couple days of ordering and the jerky looks fresh and delicious.  I can't wait to try the habanero one! (If my brother lets me...)<br /><br />Definitely recommend!!!

review/summary: The Wild Huckleberry-Tastebud Bursting Flavor; Pure Ambrosia
review/text: The wild Huckleberry is the most ambrosia-like of all berries, with a tastebud bursting robust flavor, somewhat tart, quite rare, and never to be mistaken for the more common blueberry. Indeed, the delicacy is so extraordinary that Mark Twain named his most famous character after it. And why not? People who know about wild Huckleberries tend to be very passionate about them. Evocative of summer sunlight, mountainsides, mysterious woods, and images of children berry hunting. The huckleberry bushes' small oval leaves, the blue-black berries, perfectly round, each with an intense flavor, a unique tartness and crunch.<br /><br />This uncultivated cousin of the blueberry, grows only in the wild at elevations of 4,000 to 6,000 feet. Twelve species of huckleberries are native to Washington and Oregon. They also grow wild in the Rocky Mountains. However varied the berry, the season is short: late July through mid-September. Because they are hard to find, they tend to be expensive. But huckleberry lovers swoon over the thick skin and wild flavor that no other berry captures as well. As far as I am concerned, these berries, food of the god's, are worth every penny.<br /><br />Huckleberry Haven's Wild Huckleberry Jam perfectly captures the pure, natural taste of this most elite of berries. Buy one jar and you will be back to buy an entire case. I spread the jam on toast, muffins, scones, French Toast, occasionally even on pancakes - much better than syrup, and as another reviewer wrote, this is the best jam to accompany peanut butter. I hope you try this product. I always have a jar in the fridge. ENJOY!!<br /><br />JANA

review/summary: Delicious AND decorative!
review/text: These are so pretty and the subtle plum flavor coupled with the toasty nuttiness of the sesame seeds gives the culinary curiosity seeker some taste-bud adventure as well as a unique visual display.<br /><br />This year [2011] I plan on making a non-traditional Christmas dinner with 5 different kinds of Sushi and I can't wait to use these for my Sushi. I'm going to buy the green Wasabi sesame seeds by Roland next month so that I can do a cute red and green inside-out Sushi. Maybe I'll even take a picture and upload it to Amazon.com if it turns out well.<br /><br />The bottles are convenient in size and I like the little twist-off lids for shaking the seeds on your choice of food. I like to shake some of these on my stir-fries and soups after plating. If you stir these into something during cooking, their pretty color WILL wear off, so they are best used after cooking rather than during.<br /><br />Note: These plum sesame seeds are NOT vegan. These contain 'carmine' which comes from beetles for the red coloring.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients listed on my bottles:<br /><br />Sesame Seeds, Seasonings, Salt, Citric Acid, Natural Plum Powder, Carmine, Spices, Sugar.<br /><br />These are a product of Taiwan.

review/summary: Great value, good coffee
review/text: Six bags of coffee for $32 is an incredible price!  I've had better coffee but I paid that price for one pound.  I'm now drinking this coffee every day and like it very much.  The hazelnut flavor is great and I don't have to use as much creamer for flavor.  The flavor is bold but not overly acidic.  I would definitely recommend this coffee and I will buy it again.

review/summary: No go for German Husband
review/text: My husband is originally from Germany and enjoys good hearty breads with hard crusts.  I order this mix from Amazon.com with him in mind.  Unfortunately we were disappointed because the bread did not rise as expected.  It did get a thick crust, but was not crusty like the breads in Germany. It was actually "tough".<br />I used the bread maker to prepare it and followed the directions to a T.  Perhaps the yeast was inferior.  Checked the date on the mix and it was not expired.<br />So I will not be purchasing it again.  In fact, I have the second two packages sitting on the shelf.

review/summary: Never tasted anything like it in Germany....
review/text: ....and I lived there for 20 years.  I used the bread machine for this mix.  Don't expect this bread to rise as high as your typical American white bread.  Like my homemade rye bread, this mix also produces a dense, heavy bread.  I like it that way as I'm not very fond of the American fluff.<br />The flavor was quite disappointing.  It's difficult to describe....it's too bitter and way too sourdough-ish.  My trash can now smells of beer from the the sourdough packet.  If you like a bitter beer that you need to chew then by all means go for this mix.  The aftertaste is indescribable.....very bitter and medicinal.<br />At $5 per loaf this is way overpriced.<br /><br />My advice:  Keep a jar of sourdough and make your own.

review/summary: Free Gift Promotion has a trick to it.
review/text: I ordered $35+ of product to qualify for the free gift. I added the promotion code during checkout. Needless to say, I was confused when everything BUT the free gift arrived. I contacted them asking if they would track where it was, and was told:<br /><br />"Thank you for your email. I apologize, but the cookies are not on your order from Amazon.  As per the instructions on Amazon,  you would have needed to put them in your cart and use the promotion code.  Promotions are not automatically applied. I apologize for any confusion."<br /><br />So there you have it. Unless you clicked on the box that says "here's how", you would never know you needed more than just the promotion code to get the free gift. You do, indeed have to add the free gift to your cart AND use the code. Wish they said that on the main page of the product. Maybe they'll update the product page now that there is a complaint.<br /><br />How do they taste? I have no idea. I'll come back and edit this after my husband opens them on Christmas morning.

review/summary: RANCID!
review/text: Any whole grains that are cracked open can go rancid easily, as they contain higher fat content than their processed versions.  That's why it is recommened you store whole grain flour in a freezer, only up to several months.  I don't know if it is the manufacturer or Amazon who did not warehouse these cans properly, but they are BAD!  I usually read many reviews before I make purchase decisions, but as I did not have any problem with one can of this multigrain before, I did not bother to check this time.<br /><br />Well, after a week of consuming this, my baby got sick.  As we were expermenting with variety of solid food, we weren't sure what was giving him diarrhea.  We removed almost everything from his diet over the course of that week, until we were left with this cereal and his formula.  Only then, it dawned on me that it could be this cereal, again, with which he didn't have any problem before.  As I read some reviews only at that point, some parents had pointed out these were rancid, and I could confirm my can smelled bad as well.<br /><br />Too bad Amazon would not accept returns on these products.  The trouble we went through warrants more than a refund - my baby developed a severe diaper rash due to constant bowl movement, and we ended up seeing a pediatrian to get a prescription for his open-blistered bottom.  This was his first diaper rash ever, and no diaper rash cream would help as he was going too frequently.  I feel terrible for not checking when I first opened this box.  Please learn from my mistake and DON'T BUY THIS!

Unfortunately when I opened the first of six containers it smelled stale as if it had been sitting on the shelf for a very long time. I decided to mix up a bowl but after tasting a bite, it confirmed my initial thought--it was old despite the expiration date. My guess is that I received a bum batch however, I am not willing to try it again when there are other organic cereals I have been happy with.<br /><br />I will say I was extremely pleased with Amazon's customer service. Although this item was non-returnable, they still issued a refund to me promptly.

review/summary: probably good, just not for my baby
review/text: My baby has the milk protein allergy and also seems allergic to soy. I am exclusivley breastfeding, so once I cut dairy and soy out, he was a very happy non-gassy baby who slept better at night. It was time to start rice cereal...I started a little before his 6 month birthday and I found this brand because of all the reviews. I neededsomething that would not upset his tummy. We tried it for a few nights. My baby loved it...he took down every bite with a spoon. Unfortunately, though,he was up all night every night with gas. He also stopped having bowel movements for several days...before we started the cereal it was every day. I went online to ask if rice cereal could cause constipation/gas and I was alarmed by all the moms who had the same experience. I was hoping the happybellies cereal would prevent this, but it didn't. I have 6 cans of it since I couldn't buy one alone, so I'm not sure what to do with them. I went straight into giving him homemade baby food and both baby and his tummy love it...we started with avocado, then banana, squash, and now sweet potatoes. I know he still needs cereal, so I'm thinking about trying the oatmeal. I was so disappointed this cereal didn't work for him.

review/summary: Revised and Yummy
review/text: I have purchased and tried all Happy Baby products and have liked them all (or at least my children have liked them all).  I really enjoy reading peoples' product reviews to see what they think of the products that I am thinking of buying.  I have to say I was a bit concerned about the number of negative reviews that were posted on the oatmeal cereal.  I bought it many years ago for my oldest child when she was a baby and we loved it, now we are buying it for my youngest child and she too is a big fan.  All of the negative reviews that I saw were 2010-2011 (back when I wasn't buying the product).  I don't know if things were changed, but my newest addition is enjoying the oatmeal just as much...if not more than my older one did.  I am really happy with the quality, quantity for the price and healthiness of the product.  We use the cereal as just plan cereal for the little one, but also got some great recipes off of the Happy Baby website and have made some other great snacks for the older one as well. It is a definite buy again and hope that Happy Baby continues to make such great, healthy products.

review/text: I bought both the rice and oatmeal 6 packs.  The cans clearly state they use Life's DHA (manufactured by Martek).  If you research Martek (including their own site), you will find that they use hexane to extract the DHA from algae.  Shame on Happy Baby for lying to parents by saying that they do not use any DHA extracted with hexane.  Will never reccommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />Also, all the cans that I opened smelled rancid.  I prefer Gerber Organic with Smart Nourish instead.
