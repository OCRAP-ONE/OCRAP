review/summary: Great/Healthy Alternative to Whey Proteins
review/text: I'm 19 and have been working out for about two years now. When I started I was told I needed to start taking a protein supplement. So like every newbie, I figured GNC was the place to go. I was told to start using the wheybolic protein by the salesman so I did. However, it was becoming too pricey and I was getting headaches regularly. Shortly after, I read in consumer reports that there are various heavy metals found in the mix. I immediately began looking for a healthy and natural alternative. I found Nutiva organic hemp protein and decided to give it a try. It's been six months and I'm hooked. This stuff is great. It's organic (which is always a plus) and it is great for you. I am able to obtain lean protein after each workout and I'll even drink it with my breakfast in the morning to start my day the right way. I mix it with vanilla almond milk or chocolate soy milk and it tastes pretty good. I receive all the benefits of this superfood without sacrificing a whole lot of taste. I highly recommend this for EVERYONE.

review/summary: yay for protein that I'm not allergic to
review/text: Don't attempt to dress it up. Just mix it with juice and down it. Once you get it past your whiney taste buds and delicate throat, your stomach and body will reassure you that it was a good thing to do. During the first few days after a fast, I lived off of a mixture of this hemp protein, spirulina powder and swiss chard juice. It was rough at first, but I felt better every day.<br /><br />My experience of living almost solely on this product for a week (and continuing using it for two weeks afterwards) tells me two things - 1. it's definitely hypoallergenic (otherwise I would have developed respiratory problems, which is my body's universal response to allergens) and 2. it's definitely got protein - because I didn't feel like I was starving (in fact I felt well-fed)<br /><br />Obviously, I'll be ordering this stuff with regular frequency!

review/summary: Great for anyone who works out!
review/text: This stuff is great! It's not as bad tasting as everyone says--you just need to be ready for the grainy, green texture it will add to your drinks. I've found that peanut butter pretty much cancels out any bad "odors" the hemp protein might have. This is a great replacement for whey protein, which is over-processed, causes bloating, and is awful for your digestive system. Hemp protein works! Since I'm in college, I don't have a blender, so I use a blender bottle w/ milk, peanut butter, and 4 TBS of this stuff. I already feel less bloated, especially with all the fiber in this stuff ;)

review/summary: An organic alternative to typical protein powders.
review/text: I have been using this protein powder exclusively for the last few months.  I used to buy whey powders, but was looking for an organic alternative that was not too expensive and still got me the extra protein I needed.  This stuff fits the bill and the extra fiber doesn't hurt.  I typically mix it with a half, sometimes a whole, tablespoon of agave sweetener in the morning and with a serving of soy milk before workouts in the afternoon.  After workouts I stick with fat free organic milk as the fiber in the hemp will only slow digestion.  **WARNING**  Drinking this stuff with only water tastes very bad.  At a minimum add a teaspoon or two of sugar.  Oh, and it doesn't seem to mix well with cow's milk but have not had any problems mixing it with soy milk.  Hope this helps.

review/summary: TASTE TERRIBLE mixed with water! However with a banana it is good!
review/text: I was looking for an organic plant based non-soy protein.  I wanted to stay away from soy because 93% is GMO & all contains high levels of pant estrogen which can raise human estrogen; since I am a man I don't like that idea.  I have been taken whey protein for years and now that I am a vegetarian it is 100% necessary to achieve my desired level of protein without a ton of extra calories. I settled on this product because it has a good amount of protein plus omega 3! The omega 3 is a HUGE plus. Initially, I mixed the protein with rice drink and it tasted VERY BAD. I then tried to mix it with water and spinach and it tasted worse. I actually enjoy drinking blended water and spinach.  I then followed some of the others advise and mixed it with a banana and it actually tastes good.  When you first try this product blend it with just water. The next time blend in a banana and you have a real appreciation for it! This will be replacing my whey protein. I am sure I can make this taste wonderful but I want to keep the calories down; so for now it is just a banana. Enjoy!<br /><br />PS Try a little cinnamon!

review/summary: Regarding the taste...
review/text: So I just got my bag in the mail today and mixed 4 tbsp in a glass of cold water. The taste isn't nearly as bad as some reviewers are making it out to be. No, it does not taste like liquid bubble gum. It's a plant-based powder with no additives, it basically tastes similar to tea w/out any sugar except with the consistency of a puree Naked juice drink. I had no problem putting down the glass w/ just water and the Nutiva powder (no fruit, no ice cream, no milk, etc). I guess maybe if you have extremely sensitive taste buds this may be difficult to drink straight up but it was absolutely fine for me. Also, it doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />I would drink this Nutiva straight up with water over most other Whey powders you'd find in a local GNC. This stuff actually tastes "natural" as opposed to like synthetic liquid crud. Oh yeah, and it doesn't clump up at all, it dissolves quite fast in cold water.

review/summary: Easy to use protein option
review/text: This product arrived today.  I immediately opened it and mixed a drink, using 4 T. of the protein, organic black cherry concentrate, reverse osmosis purified water, and liquid stevia.  It tasted great!  The green color (which bothers some) got disguised by the black cherry juice.  As for the issue of the product "sitting at the bottom" of the glass, sure, it does, but that's not a problem for me.  With my regular sized glass straw, I get protein in every slurp, especially if I stir it first.<br /><br />The above combination is the first of many variations I'm sure I'll use.  (Am thinking of experimenting with iced coffee, this product, and stevia, next.)<br /><br />Considering the nutrition, ease of use, and cost (especially with subscribe and save), the product is a winner.  It adds variation to my supply of protein powder options.

review/summary: Great Quality Product
review/text: This is a very good quality, whole food product that gives me what I want.  I look for a couple of things when buying a protein powder. They must be minimally processed, organic, and they must be 100% vegan-- so no whey protein.<br /><br />This protein fits the bill, and tastes great. I mix it into a green smoothie, and it's always a pleasurable experience!<br /><br />To get a very balanced protein profile that is 100% vegan, mix it with some pea protein.<br /><br />I've been paying around $30 for this product (give or take), so it is reasonably priced as well. Of course, the 15 grams of protein they list on the label, is in three tablespoons, so you will use more of this than some other protein powders.

review/text: The green color is a bit weird, and it does have a funny flavor but it works. Taking this product has improved my recovery time and I like that it is vegan. The added fiber is an added bonus. To get the same amount of protein as Soy I have to eat more of it but mixed with almond or hemp milk it is quite drinkable. Some of it is grainy and needs to be mixed well but it does not clump like soy protein and is easy to digest. No added sugar or additives, just protein and fiber. Pretty good mix but you have to be careful what you mix it with. Just mix it according to the directions on the bottle (use almond milk) and you will have no problems. Makes a good after workout snack.

Now I can hardly stand the overly-sweetened taste of most whey protein powder.

review/summary: Not Disappointed!
review/text: After reading the 'yuk' reviews, I was concerned it would not be palatable.  I made a shake with the same ingredients I use with vanilla flavored whey protein: start with 1/2 C unsweetened original Living Harvest Hempmilk, 4 TBS Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein, 1 C frozen strawberries (or more as they will thicken the shake), 1/4 small avacado (for healthy fat MUFAs!) It blended up thick and creamy just like the whey protein, and tasted absolutely delicious (a healthy taste, anyway). Some complained about it being gritty, but I didn't notice it as being a negative factor.  It is not that gritty. I was very pleased and this is definately going to replace the whey protein with it, as I am trying to lose weight and thought maybe the dairy is not helping me in that direction.  I'll have to wait and see if it is more effective in weight loss than the whey.  As far as storage, I used three 1 qt mason jars, vacuum sealing two that I won't be using right away and refrigerating all three.  I do make a shake everyday for breakfast after my workouts and it keeps me satisfied for 3-4 hrs.  I will definately be buying this product again! Also, some reviewers complained about the packaging, mine arrived in perfect vacuumed sealed condition.

review/text: I purchased this item after moving to a more vegan based diet.  I say vegan based because I am not strict, but try to significantly limit dairy and meat.  I work out daily and have been looking for ways to get more protein into my diet.  I have liked the Nutiva Hemp a lot.  I mix it into a blended smoothie once or twice per day.  Plain non-sweatened soy milk, banana, frozen strawberries, frozen peaches, frozen blueberries, and 3 tablespoons of the Nutiva.  The smoothie tastes great and goes down very easily.  Nutiva Hemp gives the smoothie a nuttier taste than it would have otherwise but fairly complimentary to the smoothie.  I have tried only once mixing the protein powder into a glass of water and drinking directly... let's just say I recommend sticking to mixing into smoothies.

review/summary: Great Find
review/text: This is a great find for anyone who is searching for a high-protein, easy-to-use, and bulk priced food source.  It is sealed in a vacuum packed bag, but is easily pour-able once you break the seal (no lumps from packaging).  The instructions tell you to use one (of the three pounds) at a time, and freeze the remainder to keep it fresh.  I used baggies to divide up what I froze into smaller units that would work for the speed/way that I consume it.  I bought this increased protein source because it is a fast way to add protein to salads, eggs, oatmeal, cookies, etc.  I have so many food intolerances that I have to be on the watch for ways to bring protein into my diet.  This is excellent for general health benefits, and will "take on" the taste of what it is added to (can be added to either a healthy cookie batter, or an entre such as a stir-fry or salad.  The price was the best I found, and shipping was fast.

review/summary: The nutritional panel looks great, the taste however, not so much!
review/text: I was interested in trying hemp protein, I've heard and read raving reviews of the protein.  When I got it I was excited to try it, directions say to mix 3 tbls with 8 oz milk, but they recommend almond milk.  I opened the tub and was briefly set back by the smell and green color.  But I trucked on anyway.  I mixed it up with my wand mixer, but it didn't fully blend.  It did not dissolve fully, even after extended blending.  Still gritty.  The taste, like the smell was like broccoli.  The drink was like milky broccoli... it was gross.  I would have givent it 1 star, but if you can get past the taste the nutriontal value is very good, just not for me.

review/summary: Good product.  Too bad it doesn't agree with me.
review/text: I ordered the 3-pound bag of Nutiva 50% Protein Hemp Powder at the beginning of July.  I wanted to replace whey protein with hemp protein to cut down on processed foods for bodybuilding.  The quality of the product was superb and fresh.  Taste-wise, it isn't the best tasting powder in the world, but that can easily be fixed by mixing it with almond milk.<br /><br />After drinking my first shake I noticed a lot of gas and bloating -- which is odd given that this product is supposed to have less bloat than whey.  I figured my body was simply adjusting to the extra fiber and kept taking it for the next month.<br /><br />For the second-third weeks, my body was able to tolerate this stuff relatively well.  However, when I reached the 6-7th week, I started getting severe bloating and stomach pains to the point of vomiting.  In addition, I got a slight headache, slight chills and muscle twitching in my ears.  Given this product's reputation, I didn't want to attribute my problems with this product.  I went to the doctor and he gave me a trial of a proton pump inhibitor.  I suspected my GI problems were due to the pre-workout supplement I was taking.  The proton pump inhibitor should allow my digestive system to heal.<br /><br />To rule this product out, I quit taking the hemp and pre-workout supplement for a few days and simply ate more regular food.  I felt better by the weekend.  After those few days, I tried whey protein.  No bloating.  That night, I tried another hemp shake (with almond milk).  One hour after drinking the shake, I got the severe bloating and pain again.. just as bad as before.  I also got the slight headache, chills and ear muscle twitching.  It definitely isn't the almond milk, as I drink almond milk all the time for breakfast.  It also isn't the fiber, as I eat salads full of broccoli all the time.<br /><br />It appears I have an allergic reaction to hemp protein powder.  That is a shame, given all the health benefits of hemp.<br /><br />For now, I will have to stick to whey.

review/summary: Pretty good base for your Beer
review/text: In this, my 4th year of home brewing, I have decided that crushing grains and watching thermometers was just to much. I drink 5 gallons of beer in about 2 weeks so the trouble of grain brewing was not worth the time.<br />I use this extract along with dextrose and hops to bend the beers flavor to my will.Very good base if you like a darker beer and the added hops can give you an IPA flavor without the multigrain,multihopped mess that I tried to cook from scratch. I do not use this extract as a stand alone beer malt but it is a neat short cut to a better brew than most kits. As I said, use it as a base and add other ingredients and your beer should turn out fine. My last batch using this extract is about to be repeated.

review/summary: Extremely Tasty
review/text: Bread Bisquick Cheese and Garlic / B000EMM9YO<br /><br />I really like these biscuits. They taste wonderful - garlicky and cheesy and hot - and they are easy to mix and bake. As an added bonus, they are extremely flexible portions-wise; it is easy to make several small biscuits for a crowd or a few larger biscuits for a smaller group.<br /><br />However, I will add a caveat - I am absolutely addicted to Rod Lobster dinner rolls, to the point that I will often eat there even though I do not much care for much of the menu (I'm not a big fish eater, I'm afraid). These rolls, though very tasty, are not a true substitute for Red Lobster's rolls. These rolls are heavier, and do not have the light, flaky touch that the Red Lobster biscuits have. They are still quite good, but I just don't want someone to buy these in bulk expecting Red Lobster, because you will be a little disappointed.<br /><br />If you want to approximate the Red Lobster taste a little more, I find that sprinkling the rolls with melted butter and a little garlic salt helps. A little of the McCormick Parmesan Herb spice mix also jazzes up the mix, in my opinion. If anyone has any other ideas for "Red Lobsterfication" I'd love to hear them.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/text: Nothing particularly special or tasty, really. I love both cheese and garlic so I thought this would be one to knock out of the park but... meh. The biscuit had a slight bit of cheese but the only hint of garlic I tasted didn't come until a few minutes after eating when I belched a little bit. The texture was rather doughy due to the cheese (it was thoroughly cooked, I assure you) and I would probably have been happier with a simple buttermilk biscuit. Three stars overall for the convenience of a desperate meal.

For several reasons. They keep indefinitely, even after being opened. However, they don't last long in our household so I need to have some hidden in our pantry.<br /><br />Also, what if the power went out. What if your frozen or fresh strawberries weren't available? These have plenty of Vitamin C per serving (60% of the DV which I believe is Daily Value) and only 15 calories per 1/4 cup. Those who have ALLERGIES (yes, I'm capping that) should be aware that they are made on equipment that could also be used to process soy, wheat, egg, peanut and tree nuts.<br /><br />Anyway, These are just perfect for snacks, eating directly from the can, reconstituting (add water) and using in baking, sprinkling over cereal or adding to recipes. The use is limited only by your imagination.<br /><br />Oh, yes - while I hope food prices don't continue to soar, you could possibly save money with these around.

review/text: These are the best berries I've ever tasted!  I thought for sure they were sweetened, but they're not.  The berries they used must have been perfectly ripe and the flavor just blasts your mouth when you try them.  Additionally, the slices are whole, with very little breakage in the can.  The value you get is pretty great, considering that 8oz of berries is approximately equivalent to 5# of fresh strawberries.  At $3/lb (+ shipping) that's really not bad, and you can have these year-round, even when strawberries aren't in season.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: These freeze dried strawberries are fabulous.  I use them in everything from cold cereal to oatmeal and even as an ice cream topping.  Most recently, I've chopped them up and added them to a batch of Rice Krispy treats (receiving rave reviews in the process!)  They're also great to snack on plain.  They have a light, crisp texture but they are not crunchy and they absorb moisture immediately.  Although 8 ounces doesn't sound like much, you really get a very generous quantity of these lighter-than-air strawberries.  I recommend this item highly!

review/summary: OK  but not what I was looking for
review/text: I was looking for the same type of dried strawberries you find in Special K Red Berries.  These were OK but if you pop them in your mouth right out of the can they are difficult to eat, not crispy after they are in your mouth - not sure how to put it other than they stick to your teeth. They are really good in oatmeal and I imagine in anything else where they would be cooked or otherwise re-hydrated.

review/summary: My Picky Cat LOVES this food!
review/text: I was advised to try this food by a worker at Petco when I was having difficulty finding wet cat food that my cat would like. His wet food 3oz per day would sit in his dish for hours with him only touching a little bit of it. It was a total waste of money for me.<br /><br />At first I was questioning the quality of the food because it was set in between the cheaper low supermarket brand cat foods instead of it being placed near the higher quality foods like Wellness, Natural Balanace, Blue Buffalo etc. The worker said.... "just try one 3oz can and see if your cat likes it." I looked at the ingredients and it looked like a pretty good food list. I asked her if it was made by Petco and she said "no."  I asked her if she knew who made it and she was not sure.  I am glad the other reviewer posted that it is made by the same company who manufactures<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70V0">Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> which has excellent reviews on Amazon. Finding this out makes me feel so much better about giving this food to my cat.  I give my cat a dry combo of Nature's Variety Rabbit Food with Blue Buffalo adult so I know he is getting great dry food in his system so I wasn't too worried about the wet not being up to the level of the dry as long as the food wasn't full of crappy stuff.<br /><br />Well I gave him him the Shrimp flavored one first the other day and he literally ate it in 3 or 4 minutes without stopping to take a break. I then went back to Petco to buy some more Shrimp and figured I should just try all of the flavors. Well, there wasn't much to choose from but I did buy as many flavors as was available. Apparently cat owners are getting told about this wonderful food and the stores are running low on it. I picked up the Chicken & Pumpkin(gone in 3 minutes again yesterday) as well as the Tuna in Gravy ( ate it this morning in less than no time) so I am really glad the Petco worker suggested this food to me. I am certain that my male Ragdoll will love the rest of the flavors too given how much he has loved 3 of them so far.<br /><br />The foods come either in a gelee or a gravy. My cat loves both forms of the wet cat food. The three cans I have opened so far two of them, the chicken and the tuna were both in a shaved meat form while the crab was not in a shaved form but I could see the pieces of crab in the food.  I couldn't not believe that I saw actually crab meat in this food!  I hate to tell more cat owners about this food in fear that the shelves will be completely empty when I need cat food but I just couldn't help spreading the good news about this new food I found.<br /><br />I would not hesitate trying this food. It seems to be a winner in my house!!

review/summary: Good cat food for a decent price
review/text: Soulistic cat foods are made by the same company that makes Weruva and BFF, but it is made specifically for Petco.  My son recommended these brands as a better grade of food with a little better price than some of the higher end foods (he was a local pet store manager and learned about all kinds of pet foods). So far we have only tried the "gelee" flavors, not the "gravy" ones.  They are all tuna or chicken based, with other fish products mixed in among the ingredients.  They are grain-free, no soy, gluten or nasty additives.  So far I have not had any complaints from the crew here (6 ranging from 4 months to 11 years).  Next order we may try the "gravy' flavors.  Shipping was less expensive if ordered through Amazon than through Petco, shipping was quick, package arrived before the expected delivery date.

I've tried most of the human-grade canned cat food out there but this is the one that my cats gobble up every time with no complaint... and one of my cats is normally pretty finicky.  When you open the can the fish and chicken are recognizable in both the gelee and gravy bases.  Try the tuna & shrimp dinner in gelee, the tuna & crab surimi dinner in gelee or the chicken dinner in gravy - those are the top three favorites at my house.

review/text: Chicken wing sauces are easy to overthink. The purist wants nothing but Frank's Red Hot and butter (conveniently packaged, premade, by Frank's). The more adventurous may try something like a Parmesan-garlic or mango habanero. But among the mainstream wing aficionados, the only debate is how hot and what kind of heat to apply.<br />Budweiser's Hot and Spicy packs a nice amount of heat, with a vinegary tang and good pepper flavor. It's not so hot that is sears the taste buds, but it may be too hot for more delicate palates. If you like your wings spicy, but not bar-challenge-sign-a-waiver hot, this sauce should suit you well.<br />My only complaint is that the sauce is on the thin side, and doesn't cling to a naked wing all that well. I'll try it again with a breaded wing, which should solve that problem.<br />Definitely worth a try for the wing connoisseur.

review/summary: Consumer beware--there is no actual truffle in the making of this product
review/text: The truffle "essence" on the label is a synthetic compound manufactured in a laboratory to mimic the smell of real truffles. If that is what you want, cool. But you should know what you are really buying. This is really more of a truffle perfume. No actual truffles were used to make this product. I find the deceptive labeling on this product to be very offensive. I wouldn't buy it just because of that.<br /><br />I am getting negative comments from someone that are rather interesting. They say they called Urbani a different company, and that Urbani told them that their product is made with real truffles and therefore my review is wrong. Here is the direct quote from the person: "I actually contacted Urbani, who is one of the leading purveyors of truffles. They assured me that their truffle oils are pure natural products derived only from truffles."<br /><br />First of all, La Tourangelle and Urbani are different companies and totally unaffiliated. So it is entirely irrelevant what Urbani said about their product. Second, I'm not sure I would believe what a salesperson tells me to begin with.<br /><br />As to the person's claim that the ingredients list for La Tourangelle says extract--it used to say aroma. I find it very suspicious that the label changed from saying aroma to extract. It seemed obvious to me something funny was going on so I just called the Food and Drug Administration and the customer service representative specifically told me that the FDA "has never defined extract." In other words, the FDA has not legally said this is what an extract is so anything can legally be called an extract, including chemicals synthetically manufactured in a laboratory that did not come from the actual product. So if a company calls something an extract when it is not, the FDA has no ability to do anything about it. So a regular person like you or I may believe that an extract is something made from the actual product, but the FDA has never defined it as such.  I can mix two chemicals in a laboratory and call them gold extract because extract is not defined.<br /><br />In other words, the company is now back to trying to trick you again by using the term extract knowing that you will believe that means that extract means something actually taken from a real truffle, but it does not mean that at all. Please, anybody with common sense--do you really think that La Tourangelle changed their label to say extract instead of aroma because their manufacturing process has changed or do you think that they just did that because they can legally get away with it and it will trick some people into thinking the product is something it isn't because they know they can do it since there are no laws against that?

review/text: I first bought this Jack Links beef pepperoni stick at the local Big Lots outlet. The stick was about 14 inches long and I cut it in half to eat because, well a 7 inch piece is enough for a snack. The consistency is perfect, no sinew like in other brands and the taste is great. The 9 pack of 7 inch sticks is perfect in a resealable bag. Auto ship is a great way to have these on hand when you get the urge to snack, and by the way there is only 7g of fat and 1g of carbs per stick. I just love them...

review/text: I buy these for snacks for my husband while he is at work. He LOVES them.  So often the stores are out of them or do not offer them, this is a great way to buy them.  They are always available and at a great price.  I will keep buying these as long as they are just the way they are, flavor, price... everything.

review/summary: Great Skin and Coat!
review/text: I changed cat foods after one of my cats had a bout of chronic diarrhea that was not going away. This food has no dyes in it and he's tolerated this food much better than anything else we've tried so far. In just one month we noticed our cats have such nice shiny, soft coats! They also love the taste and we can't keep enough of it in the house!

review/summary: Excellent Cat Food... but...
review/text: ...seriously, buy it at PetSmart - it costs less there and no shipping costs!!!<br /><br />This is great cat food though, another commenter mentioned her cat having chronic loose stools and that this did the trick, and I found the same thing to be true, along with the addition of a daily dose of Petramalt.  Both of my cats have incredibly silky coats now, healthier teeth, and they even shed less!  It's really good stuff, and I normally wouldn't buy Purina.

review/summary: Hard to find in Honduras
review/text: This is the only cat food we fed our 5 cats in Florida.  We had two 20 years old, one 18 year old and two 4 years old.  Our 3 oldest all had to be put down during the last year from various ailments relating to their ages and one of the 4 years old we lost to cancer in spite of an operation and two chemo treatments.  It was a sad year.  They all loved Purina Cat Chow Naturals and seemed to thrive on it.  In June of this year we made a move to Roatan in the Bay Islands of Honduras and of course "Mikey" came with us. When we first got here we were pleased to find the Purina Naturals on the shelves of two of our 4 Supermarkets but then it disappeared (maybe we bought it all).  We started feeding our two cats (We adopted "Paco" on the island)something else and Mikey would occasionally throw up and neither of them seemed overly fond of their new food.  Of course "Paco" would eat anything because he was starving when we found him.  I finally ordered two 15lb. bags of the Naturals from Amazon and it arrived about 3 weeks later.  I'm happy to say that they both dived into it and "Mikey" likes it better than his "wet" food.  Their coats are both shiny and they both seem to be thriving.  It's not cheap to have 30 lbs. of Cat food shipped from the States, but well worth it.  Maybe someone from Purina could talk to the local Supermarkets and have them start ordering again.  They couldn't keep it on the shelves it sold so rapidly.  Maybe that's why they stopped handling it (a local joke).  Anyway, I highly recommend it.
