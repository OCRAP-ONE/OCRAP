review/summary: Delicious dark red kidney beans
review/text: These are truly delicious dark red kidney beans. Although higher priced than the "other" dark red kidney available online, these do not appear to be from China as the case with the other brand. After the dubious quality of foods coming from China - I'd personally prefer to pay a tad more. These cook well, become plump and very tasty...just like a kidney bean should be. Spouse immediately noticed the diffrerence (much to my surprise!) and insisted on purchasing these above all others for chili/other dishes. Very good selection.

review/summary: Superb quality & price, *excellent* for meal planning and freezer cooking
review/text: These are excellent.<br /><br />Dried beans are significantly more healthy (and economical) that canned beans, and the difference in flavor and texture is *amazing* - truly! I should also note that organic beans are smaller in size that non-organic varieties, as they have not been modified. Often people are surprised and may mistakenly find these inferior, but that is not the case.<br /><br />Clearly there is more time involved in preparation, but a few months ago I started doing the following, which may help others:<br /><br />I dedicate a certain time to 'bean cooking.' I'll use 3-4 *very* large containers and soak 3-4 different varieties. Note that for the sake of efficiency (time saving) I do not soak a single box - I generally soak 3-5 boxes, or whatever the total included in each varieties' respective Subscribe & Save order is.<br /><br />After all beans are soaked, all beans get cooked. I don't have an arsenal of extra large pots, so 1-2 varieties may need to be cooked in two batches due to my cookware availability. However, since the most time consuming part of preparing dried beans is the soaking, this really doesn't take very long and other things can be done whilst these simmer away on the stove. Some people enjoy using crock pots for dried beans; my own experience is that I have less control over the quality and the end result is not as good.<br /><br />As the different varieties are cooked & cooled, they are divided into two (2) cup portions and placed directly into individual packages for the freezer. (The portion size is a very personal matter; we happen to have a large family/entertain a lot.) Depending on what's on hand/not in use, the packaging may be Rubbermaid containers/ziploc bags/pressure sealed. I prefer not to dispose of plastics, so those are turned inside out & run through the dishwasher to be re-used. Works beautifully.<br /><br />The individual packets defrost beautifully in the refrigerator overnight, or in a pinch using your microwave's defrost setting they're ready to go in less than two minutes. Using great quality beans has enabled us to cut down significantly on the amount of meat that we consume, and high quality beans make vegetarian dishes satisfying and filling to the most ardent meat lovers - unlike canned varieties. This preparation process makes meal planning a *breeze* and ensures that very healthy food is always on hand - at an excellent price.

review/summary: Dried Organic Beans
review/text: Since the product description and all the other reviews fail to mention it, I am writing this review. The beans are dried and vacuum packed so I expect they have a very long shelf life and the expiration date is probably required rather than realistic. Dried beans have been stored for 30 years and found to still be good. Storing that long will probably have some loss of vitamin. A package packed as these are that is a couple years beyond the expiration date will probably have no noticeable difference in quality or taste.

review/summary: Healthy and economical
review/text: Organic beans that are not canned are difficult to find in most stores so this 6 pkg. buy was great.  I cook big batches ahead of time and freeze them in typical recipe sizes.  Then I pull them out as needed.  For someone who believes organic is important, this is a great economical way to do beans for chili, soups, or even 'refried' beans.  They are big, healthy looking beans.

So easy to cook and at a price that makes it an almost no-brainer in what to buy, particularly when compared to commercially canned varieties. FWIW, Eden's dry black beans are of equal quality.<br /><br />-Will keep eating 'em.

review/summary: Eden Kidney Beans
review/text: I used to track kidney beans in stores, but didn't succeed, only canned and cooked. So it was good to see it on Amazon!<br /><br />You should include red kidney beans in your regular meal plan because of its core nutritions contained, high protein and minerals, especially iron, for the latter. And I believe Eden kidney beans are natural products by its taste and the appearance before and after cooking.<br /><br />Very good product and reasonable pricing.

The McNess Bratwurst Mustard was a good substitute, but it, too, has disappeared.  This, also made by McNess, is the next best thing, even though it's a bit more expensive.<br /><br />My local Fresh Market has quit carrying it, so I'm thrilled to find it on Amazon.com.

review/text: My 17 month old lactose- intolerant toddler LOVES THESE! And they taste pretty good for toddler snacks. Not too sweet.  With Subscribe and Save and free shipping it cost less than purchasing individual boxes at Walmart or Target who may not have them in stock because they aren't a popular item.

review/text: My 15 month old daughter LOVES these and so do I! They have a wonderful strawberry essence to them, but are not overly sweet. PLUS they are fairly mess free and they dissolve so easily that it is the perfect snack for when she is in the car to keep her fuss free, or eating on the go around the house (my daughter hates to sit down and eat, so we always try and give her snacks to tote around with her). The 12 month old and the 3 year old little boys I take care of also love them. These are fantastic!

review/summary: Great item for l'il ones with wheat intolerances!
review/text: My son has a wheat intolerance and finding kids' snacks without wheat is very rare. He loves these and will happily crunch through them, especially when he's teething. We absolutely love these and the strawberry ones are his favorite.  It's also one of the first things he was able to eat all by himself.  He would chew through these like a little chipmunk.  It's saved us on so many occasions when he needed a little snack or was grouchy from teething.

review/text: My toddler loves these mum-mums.  I can't find the strawberry flavor in any store.  These are my 'go to' snack when we're at the grocery store.  They keep my daughter happy and don't make a big mess.  I keep waiting for her to decide that a teething biscuit is too bland to be her special snack, but they are what she always asks for.  While not as healthy as bringing along apple slices, they are much better than other alternatives (and I have to reiterate the important fact that they aren't messy - my favorite part!).

review/text: I was greatly disappointed when my grocery store quit carrying mum-mums! So I was happy to find them on Amazon cheaper than I was paying in the grocery store. My daughter loved the regular mum-mums when she was younger and now loves the toddler ones. She is 16 months now and still loves these. They are great to bring into a store to keep her occupied because they do NOT make a mess like a cracker does! I've had to explain to a TON of people that I am NOT feeding my child styrofoam (b/c that's what they look like!!!).

They are also very easy to take with you because they are individually wrapped in a 2 piece serving size.

They don't get all sticky and gooey...don't get me wrong, there will be crumbs and some pieces that will stick to wherever the kids are eating them, but it's quite minimal.  I also find the crackers tasty, so if I need a quick snack I will eat them too.  Love these!

review/summary: Great item to take on those long days out.
review/text: These are great because they are individually wrapped in packs of 2. It is easy to throw a couple of these in your bag and take them for those times that your kids get antsy or want a snack. They are light, organic, and healthy. This is a pack of six boxes so you will have plenty on hand. The only problem with this product is that they all expire at the same time, and it is only a month and a half or two out. They are organic and it's the same expiration dates as the store, so it's not that they are old stock, that is just how they are made. However, 6 boxes of 24 crackers may be a bit much for some. I was worried about it, but we are working our way through them with no problem at all.

review/summary: Awesome product for little ones
review/text: This is an awesome product. I was looking for something for my son when he was starting to cut his teeth. The other biter biscuits were very thick and very messy. What is nice about this product is that it is not very messy, it doesn't upset his stomach, it tastes good (I have eaten what he doesn't finish, LOL), and you don't have to worry about choking since the rice practically melts in his mouth. My son started eating this probably around six months and he is now almost 22 months and still eats it. I have recommended it to a couple other moms and their kids love them. Unfortunately with only 12 packages in a box it doesn't last very long, especially of your child eats 3 packages a day.

review/text: My daughter loves these!  I know the box says toddler, but like the previous reviewer said, there is little difference between these and the baby variety.  These might be slightly thicker and they are a round.  I love Mum Mums.  Such a great alternative to Wagon Wheels and Biter Biscuits, which can be a choking hazard.  And the previous reviewer who calls these "expensive" needs to learn to read, or at least, read more carefully before leaving a review.  There are 6 boxes in this pack.  They sell for about $3.50 per box in the store, so it's not a bad deal at $18 for a 6 pack.

review/summary: Similar to Senseo's Paris French Vanilla, just not as good
review/text: You may be able to tell from the title for this review that I enjoy Senseo's Paris French Vanilla coffee pods.  I decided to try Wolfgang Puck's caramel creme in my Hamilton Beach 1 cup pod brewer because the Senseo brand has been unavailable for quite some time. Unfortunately, Wolfgang Puck's version is not as good.<br /><br />If you prefer a strong cup of coffee this brand will most likely not satisfy you.  Also, the Hamilton Beach Pod Brewer does not make the crema layer that a lot of people seem to like, so I don't know if this brand will do that well or not.  I drink my coffee weak -- not super strong -- but also not watery.  My daily one cup of coffee is a treat I allow myself and I enjoy the French Vanilla and Caramel flavored coffees. Also, I use a smaller coffee mug (it holds at most 8 ounces comfortably) so I don't need a lot of coffee but this stuff is extremely weak (even for me) and I have to be sure to use **no more than** 6 ounces of water with this brand, otherwise it is just too weak and watery to be palatable.  Again, if you use a different pod brewer you may get different results.<br /><br />I've also tried Wolfgang Puck's French Vanilla flavored coffee pods, but I find that flavor to brew up even more weak and watery than this does and it has a very "acidy" aftertaste which aggravates my heartburn -- I have not had that problem with this flavor (Caramel Creme.)<br /><br />If you want a larger, stronger cup of flavored coffee, you might be able to make this work better for you by using 2 pods with 12 ounces of water (the maximum amount for the HB Pod brewer); it just hasn't worked out for me.  Using 12 ounces of water and 2 pods seems to more than double the strength of the coffee and it comes out stronger than I like.  Also, I really only want 1 cup of coffee for my morning "ritual" so the rest is just wasted.

review/text: Think the taste of an Altoid mint with the consistency of Brach's Starlight mints (drops are 3/4 the size of Starlight)...and no questionable ingredients. These mints are a staple in my home and purse.

review/summary: Wow Mints
review/text: These are great mints.  I love starlight mints, but I am trying to be more responsible about what I eat. These have the flavor of a strong mint like an Altoid, and a hard candy texture like starlight mints.  These are great for a mint lover who wants to be more responsible with what they eat, or has alergies to certain food things.

review/summary: Keep your kids away from this.....Same as any industry hard Candy
review/text: These are not flavors derived from natural fruits....they are flavor industry created chemicals that can be called "natural" only because of the very very lose definition the FDA allows for flavorings. These candy's are as bad for you and your kids as is any other hard candy. These guys are just a fraud or just so stupid that they just don't understand what they are doing. In either case you are better off just giving your kids some real organic fruit and keeping them from acquiring a taste for this type of trash!

review/summary: The Best Peppermint Candy
review/text: I love these little peppermint drops.  They have a rich peppermint taste that commercial peppermint candy don't offer, plus they are low in calories but big in taste.  I buy them by the big bags to always have them on hand (I don't eat any other candy) and when I am running low, I go ahead and reorder/restock so I never have to run out.

review/text: I used to buy Brach's starlight mints all the time.  Because of the red dye and H/F corn syrup, I decided to look other places for a good mint.  I bought the 4 16 oz bags for $20.  I like them a lot.  Since I am trained on the starlights, it will take awhile to get used to these mints...but I know I will. Very, VERY minty.  Buy 'em.  No undesirable ingredients.

review/text: YummyEarth Organic Candy Drops, Wild Peppermint, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4) are pretty good according to my loyal mother. She claims they even help her to breathe better but that point is debatable. At one time she had me believing that cough drops were good for her overall breathing but I came to find out that what she really likes is hard candy in any form or shape. I conducted a brief experiment with her: I bought her a large bag of regular candy, like 20 lbs of variety type candy, and stopped giving her cough drops. Well, it seems that what she mostly wanted was hard candy in her mouth and she never once asked me for the cough drops while she had this sizable bag available. At her age and according to her doctor she should get away with almost anything so I did not sweat the situation. Her dental work is, of course, expensive for she is addicted to sugar in the form of hard candy. Getting back on track: while she was enjoying YummyEarth Organic Candy Drops, Wild Peppermint, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4) she praised them daily. I liked the amount on each bag and the many kind and encouraging reviews I found prior to purchasing this item. 4 Stars and when the faithful bag of candy disappears in time record I will give her the last two, which I am sure she will go back to endorsing the healthy properties of this cough drop, wild peppermint and all!

review/summary: Perfect for fine detail decorating...
review/text: I have used this item about three times since I purchased it and used them to write on fondant that has been dried a day or more.  This product is excellent so far.  It has a medium tip and writes well.  I would definitely purchase again.<br /><br />Update...have been using these markers for 2-years and still going strong. LOVE them!! The tip is still as precise as the first day and enable me to do amazing detail work.<br /><br />Originally I stated that I waited for the fondant to dry a day or more, which is still true. However, if you are decorating fondant that has been rolled fairly thin, you can decorate within 10-15 minutes with the marker on a normal (not humid) day.

review/summary: Terrible...
review/text: I bought these because I was hosting a baby shower for my sister. My daughter, my daughter's friend and I were making cake pops for the event.  I bought these because they were the least expensive and I thought that they would be comparable to other name brands.  edible pens are edible pens, right?  Wrong! We made 60 baby themed cake pops and we needed these pens to draw the eyes, hair and cheeks on the "babies."  My daughter and her friend were practically cursing these pens before the night was over.  The black marker held up a little better that the rest, but the other colors were not good at all.  They smeared everywhere after a while.  The tips were not the best.  It was almost like they could not handle the interaction with the chocolate.  They got the job done, but barely.  Next time, I would add a little money to my purchase and get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0020ZURDI">Americolor Food Marker Writers- 10 Color Pack</a>.  I have heard nothing but good things about these pens, and plus they are the ones that Bakerella uses and recommends on her cake pops. :)

review/summary: Writing on candy coating...
review/text: First of all I'd like to say Ateco is Americolor.  I wanted to buy Americolor and thought I had purchased the wrong ones but they're the same the markers say Americolor though the package says Ateco.  Using these markers to write on candy coating.  Initially I was upset with these markers when I took my candy coatings in from the cold and started to write, the ink beaded up and didn't stay on.  I could easily wipe it away with paper towel.  I realized later if may have been condensation from the cold.  So I tried again... AND IT WORK!!!  Not easily though but it does work as your writing some of the coating comes off and on to your marker so have a paper towel near by to wipe marker tip.  Will post later of my snowman brownie pops.

review/text: I moved from Northern California to the Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas. I can get Starbucks at the nearby grocery stores or more expensive "gourmet" coffees, but that's about it. I have been on the lookout for robust,full flavored whole bean coffees at reasonable prices. I tried Pete's espresso blend and liked it, but it wasn't available the last time I checked. So I tried this Fogbuster and I like it even more. Good thing, since it comes in a 5 lb. bag. If you like Starbucks French Roast, this compares quite favorably.

review/summary: Lifting the veil
review/text: This is the first Jeremiah's variety I've tried, but I am completely satisfied and finally feel like I've had a "truth in advertising" moment of my very own. Although it's really the number of positive reviews already in place that sealed the deal. I figure if you're writing reviews about coffee on Amazon, you probably know a thing or two about the grind.<br /><br />Now, to reiterate, Fogbuster consists of dark, oily beans packed with rich, nutty, semisweet flavor. It also makes a full-bodied iced coffee. Fogbuster is most similar in flavor to Taylor Maid Farms' Goat Rock roast; it's as good or better than any cutely named Blue Bottle variation; and if you're waiting to hear what I have to say about Pete's Coffee, you've missed the point.<br /><br />I live in San Francisco where this is brewed, but the Jeremiah's store is in a sketchy neighborhood and it's actually far cheaper -- at the moment anyway -- to order Fogbuster through Amazon than Jeremiah's website. I've already set Fogbuster up to be ordered automatically every six months (I know one 5 pound bag won't last that long, but I also know I'm finicky and will want to try some others inbetween).<br /><br />A parting shot at Jeremiah's: Offering pre-ground beans to your customers through a middle-man warehouse is akin to Ian Astbury joining The Doors. It's sacrilegious.
