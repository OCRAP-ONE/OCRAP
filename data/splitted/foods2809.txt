review/summary: Gave my lil guy bloody diarrhea!
review/text: I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands.  After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made.  My little bully's stool was never firm.  It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day.  I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy.  The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life.  Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food.  I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the "at home remedy" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!  This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PET AND A FEW BUCKS SAVED FROM A VET VISIT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOOD!

review/summary: Love Eden foods and love this Nori!  Better deal to buy in bulk.
review/text: Just ordered this off of Amazon, and it's an excellent product.  I have been buying this brand of nori for a few years now.  This batch was extremely fresh, crunchy and greenish in color.  While that is awesome news, it also showed me that some of the prior nori I bought last year was not the freshest stuff Amazon sent me.  For some reason, I want to say that this bulk bag has fresher nori than the 5 count bags.  This also comes in a RESEALABLE bag, so you don't have to eat all of it at once.  I will be buying this from now on, instead of the 5 or 7 sheet bag.  Much better value, and reputable company this is sold from.  Love the fact Eden foods hasn't sold itself out to a bigger conglomerate and remains true to the organic/natural movement.  Excellent product!  And it comes from Japan, not China.  No offense to the Chinese, but I don't want any Nori from China.

review/summary: Love these!!!
review/text: I thought I'd try these out after reading an article about Tony Packo's and I was not disappointed. These are awesome! The pickles and peppers have just the right amount of sweet and tart. Almost like eating dill and sweet pickles at the same time and then throwing in a little spice for good measure. I usually only eat pickles or relish on a hot dog but I put this on everything: hot dogs, sandwiches, hamburgers, side dish or just as a treat. They're almost addictive. I've been out for a few weeks and still think of them fondly. As a matter of fact, I'm going to finish writing this and go buy a couple of more before I forget!

I can't stop sneaking over to the fridge and getting more. I am not telling my wife about them until they are almost gone. Get the big jar for only a couple of extra dollars. Do not waste your time with the small jar. I am a Chicago boy who grew up next to a wonderful pickle shop. I feel like a trader, but these are so good! I will be trying more of the flavors but the Sweet and Spicy rock.

review/text: Really makes a classic easy.  I always keep a couple of boxes in the pantry.  Much better than the Fantastic Foods version, which my family won't touch.  Cheaper at the store when you factor in the shipping, (though I can see some of you have trouble finding it).  Add lots of tomato, cucumber, slivered red onion, flat-leaf parsley.  Yum.  Sometimes I add grilled chicken and it's a one dish meal!  The box, with additions, can easily feed a family of 4, so it's a really cheap meal, to boot.<br /><br />Oh, and if you're a fiber freak, like I am, take note that it has 5 grams per serving.  That's before you add all those veggies.

review/text: This is my new favorite lunch for work.  It's so easy to make.  Empty the box (contains seasoning packet), cover with hot water, stir, cover and refrigerate.  When the wheat has absorbed all the liquid, add chopped tomatoes, cucumber, olive oil, and lemon juice.  It's also great with grilled chicken or shrimp mixed in.  Due to the high fiber content, it is very filling and healthy.  It's not something my family will eat, but I make a box for myself every week.  At grocery stores, I have seen it on the rice/pasta aisle and also in ethnic foods aisles.

review/summary: 4 1/2  Only Vanilla-esque, but Still Adds Flavor
review/text: From the R. Torre Company in South San Francisco comes this "flavoring syrup in its familiar castle-decorated bottle."  I add it to sweeten and add a twist of flavor to coffee, but there are many other uses.  The label suggests adding it to "sparkling water, steamed milk, hot chocolate, iced coffe, or expresso drinks." Torani comes in many flavors; my favorite simple recipe is adding hazelnut flavoring to steamed, frothy milk.  Yum!<br /><br />Ingredients.<br /><br />Pure cane sugar, vanilla extract with other natural flavors, potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate (preservatives), and citric acid.<br /><br />That cane sugar is pretty strong. I suggest adding Torani Vanilla with some restraint, or you may mix up a cloyingly sweet beverage.<br /><br />Nutritional Value.<br /><br />You don't add this for nutrition, bue here are the facts, anyway: In each two tablespoon serving there are 70 calories, no fat, no sodium, no protein, and 18 grams of carbohydrates (16 grams of which are from sugar).<br /><br />There are lots of other flavors. For recipes and more information you can call toll free to 800/775-1935, or check out their websitre at www.torani.com.

review/summary: Pesto gouda=magic
review/text: I got drunk one night and decided (against my better judgment) to order this cheese assortment for my birthday.<br /><br />We didn't get the cheddar with Thai curry, which I was really looking forward to.  It was substituted with cheddar with caramelized onions.  The onion flavor was overpowering, the cheese itself was an unappetizing yellow/vomit color, and I did not like.  One of my friends, however, loved it and ended up taking the rest of it home.<br /><br />I had never had mimolette before I got this cheese assortment.  It looks like cantaloupe and the rind smells like a corpse that has been rotting in a moldy basement for several weeks.  But the taste is really mild and it's actually pretty tasty.<br /><br />No one could stomach the huntsman.  It came triple wrapped, probably so as not to alarm the USPS.  My friend ate some on a Ryvita cracker and had to spit it out.  In her words, "it tastes like how goat poop smells."  It was compared several times to garbage or rotting vegetable matter.  I thought it smelled remarkably like durian.  I feel I should also point out that the huntsman we received was not bright pink like the picture, but dull orange, almost like cheddar.<br /><br />The pesto gouda was magical and redeemed the whole package.<br /><br />The crackers left something to be desired.  We received fig crackers which were NOT black and tasted like stale crispy fig newtons.<br /><br />I give this assortment 3 stars because the gouda was awesome, the mimolette was ok, and it all around just has great entertainment value.  Even if no one eats the damn cheese, at least it gives everyone something to talk about.

review/summary: A tastey inexpensive caviar,
review/text: This item is permanently on my grocery list, because an inexpensive caviar is an invaluable component to a healthy diet. Caviar is likely the best source of healthful Omega 3 fatty acids on the planet. Animal experiments have shown that this is sufficient to offset the cholesterol. A single serving of caviar will get you _half_ of your B12 for the day, and that is not all. Think of it, dripping with DHA, and half your B12 in one heaping teaspoonful, without killing a single fish. I have written an Amazon guide about this.<br /><br />I have additional notes about the ingredients in the customer image section where I provide a blowup of the ingredients label. It is true that some of the inexpensive lumpfish caviars have alot of food coloring, and this one is no exception. After a careful evaluation, Blue number 1 is among the safest of the food colorings. It is eliminated relatively fast, and may actually have some healthful benefits. This caviar has far more Blue number 1 than the other colorings. It actually detracts from the taste somewhat, but for the price, I give it an A+.<br /><br />I have some additional information and research in my seafood wishlist, so check that out. These inexpensive caviars tend to store better than the others, so you can keep some in the pantry. Lumpfish eggs are delicious, so go ahead, eat your caviar... with a little cheese and pepper.<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />&lt;...>

review/summary: ...and i am a Beluga addict.
review/text: ok - my brother used to work in Russia and every few months he would come visit with a few POUNDS of Beluga which he purchased at the airport's Duty free. i would fast for 4 days before his arrival.<br />no - just kidding.<br />but that was top notch caviar. my parents eat them on little crackers with some light butter and chopped parsley on top. i think it destroys the taste. i ate them with a spoon with nothing else (yea i know it sounds "Warren Buffetty" but it's the truth; i have a very sensitive palate). and i kept eating them morning, noon and evening until there was nothing left. long gone are those days because bro now lives in Amsterdam.<br />but i still crave caviar and no i wont pay hundreds of $ for a little jar.<br />i thought some cheapish thing would curb this craving. so i found Roland's.<br />i got the shipment today and the first jar is gone. ok it does not MMMMMELT in your mouth like Beluga does, it is not subtly salted like Beluga is, the grains are tiny and are not as juicy as Beluga's, but HEY! it is $11 for 2 jars and it is totally acceptable. i couldnt eat it with a spoon because the taste is not as supreme as Beluga's, so i poured some over a cracker with some SmartBalance butter spread and it was just fine for me. i added some magic to the moment by sipping some Riesling.<br /><br />tip for your guests:<br />you can very easily serve this as a glamorous appetizer over crackers with some parsley on top, along with some smoked salmon on brown bread and peeled lemon slices on top. this mix is delicious (and a great aphrodisiac too lol), and if you have a nice platter, they would look very nice. even though scottish smoked salmon is the best, Costco's ALASKA salmon is absolutely delicious and just $15 for a huge pack.<br /><br />btw, in response to some other reviews: even the best Beluga comes with some black liquid. this doesnt have to do with the quality of the caviar.

I tried it alone, with some stellar expensive cream cheese, with egg et al & just couldn't get past the salt effect. The color didn't bother me. Just the salt. I really didn't notice any other flavor because the salt, for me, overwhelmed the product.<br />Guess I better start saving my $$ for more expensive caviar.

review/summary: Thought I'd try a bite of the good life
review/text: I've never had caviar before, but based on the glowing reviews and the cheap price, I thought I'd cross caviar of my bucket list. I love the flying fish roe that comes on sushi (though it's pretty tasteless, the little "POP!" of the eggs is addictive) and I love overly salty food (I regularly drink pickle juice), but this was F-I-S-H-Y. BLECH! The flavor was akin to fish skin that has sat on the counter all day. Others had mentioned the dye and for the cheap price, I wasn't too worried about that, but the purple flecks almost as big as the eggs themselves that appeared on the cracker were unnerving. This was so horridly fishy that I had one bite and that was enough for me. Growing up and still residing in the Pacific Northwest, I've eaten a LOT of fish in my life, but this was the most fishy thing I've ever eaten. It was like licking the sand at low tide. Maybe all caviar is like that, and if so, I don't know how anyone can eat it. So, if you like savoring the flavor of cod-liver oil, this is the stuff for you, but if you don't like a mouth full of the taste of whale ejaculate, steer clear!

review/summary: great product, be aware that there are two bottle sizes
review/text: The product is great. My dog has been leaking less since using it so I do recommend the product itself. However, when comparing prices looking for the best deal, I came across the listing from Pet Food Direct and it doesn't give a detailed description of the product. Most of the listings are for a 90 ct bottle and this one was a 45 count bottle. The only way to notice this is if you look closely at the photo of the product and see the "45" on the label. I basically paid about $.50 less for a 45 ct bottle than I would have paid for a 90ct bottle as a result.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BXUWMM">Bladder Strength Dog, 90 Chew Tabs</a>

review/summary: It works, but not a tasty flavor
review/text: One of my male cats was having UT issues and was forming painful crystals. After a trip to the vet, I started him on a PETCO purchase similar to this which cured him, but they only had one bottle in stock. The ingredients on this product are basically the same but at higher milligrams. He does not like the flavor (reason I deducted one star)  so I have to make him swallow it. He thinks the multivitamin is a treat so I always give this afterward so I'm forgiven. I now give him one of these a day along w/ one dose of the D-Mannose sugar and he is symptom free. I also check his urine pH weekly to make sure it does not become overly acidic. I've purchased items from Entirely Pets a few times and have not been disappointed. Oddly their prices are usually cheaper on Amazon than their own website.

review/text: I rescued a female German Shepherd dog about 6 months before buying this product.  When she first came home, it became evident there was a problem.  Our vet diagnosed her with incontinence - which is surprisingly common for spayed female GSDs.  She is on medication, but still occasional leaks.  We bought these vitamins, and after using up the bottle was disappointed.<br /><br />The other negative is the smell.  They REEK - I didn't even like touching them.  My dog HATED the taste & would often try to spit it out.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend.

review/text: Wellness is the only canned food I buy for my cats. I has no by products, preservatives or any artificial junk. No grain, and it's first four ingredients are good meats. My cats love it (even the finicky one) and I'm happy there is at least one cat food company out there that provides nutritious pet food. Thank you Wellness! Buying this is chaper than buying in the store as well, I think if you buy the same amount in the store you pay about 13 dollars more. Just be aware of the fact that you  need a can opener to open these cans.

review/text: I like to provide variety for the cats, however, I like to stick with single protein sources.  So in addition to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.

review/summary: difficult to review for a cat but...
review/text: The product seemed great from the human viewpoint: high protein, no grain, quality ingredients and relatively reasonably priced on Amazon. However, my cats would not touch the food. I have one, older female, slightly fussy part Maine coon and a second, very large young male, an outdoor stray who has adopted us. Neither of them would eat it, both preferred the dry food  (Wellness Salmon). I usually give them both wet and dry food. The wet food, a different brand, is always eaten first but this time, both bowls of Wellness Canned cat food were left pretty much untouched after the first taste and remained so until I tossed the food the next day! I know cats are very particular ...they often dislike something for no reason I can understand and it doesn't necessarily imply a faulty product ...  but if a young, hungry stray decides against it, in this case, I reckon something is off with the product.

These brands even have by-products in their canned food.<br /><br />Cats are carnivores so the majority of their diet needs to be meat (aside from the small amount of veggies you might find in a mouse's or rabbit's stomach in the wild).<br /><br />Aside from that, my cat LOVES this food and it is very good for him. He eats a variety of flavors so he doesn't get sick of one.

Now I feed them only this food and a little bit of the dry food from this company and its no problem. My one cat was over weight and he is now more active and running around with the other cats and he looks much healthier and younger. I have one cat that vomits a lot and have had to buy special vet food, which helped him stop vomiting and he can eat this food too with no problem. I will say that the cats do like the chicken and herring recipe better, I think they like fish in general more then poultry. I do highly recommend this food, its worth the price, considering the vet food is just as expensive and there are lots of pork by-products and low quality grains in the ingredient list.

review/text: I haven't bought Wellness through Amazon yet, but the prices are very competitive and will do so.  After discovering they carried Wellness, wanted to comment on the product.  When I adopted my cat, she came with unrevealed health problems.  She was on a nebulizer every day, no energy, vomiting and more.  As one reviewer stated, I did some internet research.  I tried some of the top of the line natural foods.  Once I got her on the Wellness wet food, her health was a complete turnaround.  She's twelve and acts like four or five years of age.  No more health problems.  The consistency is smooth, a potential problem for a lot of cats that won't eat chunky foods.  I absolutely can not recommend this food more highly.  The dry, is very small pieces and she's slow to eat it, but I keep it as a 'treat' food.  The wet is perfect in every way.

My one cat would regularly throw up immediately following a meal of Pro Plan dry food.  The results now are that my cat has not thrown up in the 3 weeks since he has been on this food. I trust my vet and will continue to feed this food. My local Food Co-Op carries this food and it is cheaper than the vet's price.  My cat's health is important to me.<br />I switch between the chicken and the salmon varieties.  My 4 cats get 1/2 can(of a 5.5 ounce can) each - a day, plus, I also give them 3 tablespoons of the Wellness dry food a day.  Try it for a month and you will be pleased with the results!

review/summary: Terrible Delivery from Amazon
review/text: We usually order this from Petco because our cat has health problems and can only eat specific types of cat food. Ordering online at Amazon is easier and cheaper. But This time I noticed that this item, ordered FROM Amazon, was being promoted as a 2 day shipping item, despite having Prime Membership, and I needed it as soon as possible. After about a week of ordering this '2 day shipping item' i received notification that it had not yet shipped and was expected to be delivered a month later! The reasoning I was given was that if I order from Amazon.com directly I should expect a month wait time and they were out of stock. 1-I received no notification that the item was out of stock. 2-Don't promote something as a special with 2 day shipping when you don't mean it. People order things based on delivery time for a reason. I'm angry that I wasted my time and was relying for the food to get here in a timely manner. I will not order directly from Amazon again.

review/summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

review/summary: Healthy Kitten Food
review/text: I purchased this food on the recommendations of cat nutrition experts in the know. I read about Wellness foods online as being an excellent food for cats.<br /><br />My kitten really enjoys this food. It is his favorite canned variety of several that I rotate feeding him. I only wish the Wellness came in larger cans and offered more varieties just for kittens.<br /><br />I sure hope it's as good as claimed...I want to give my beautiful kitten the best possible diet but it is hard to know what is really lurking in those cans.<br /><br />That is why I only buy what is considered high-quality, premium foods for him. He eats a mixture of canned and frozen raw from Nature's Variety.<br /><br />(The raw medallions are his favorite of everything I feed him! )  I will continue to feed him Wellness canned food as he matures.

review/summary: Healthy Canned Diet
review/text: Until I am able to make my own raw diet for my cat, I purchase this food for her, and I've been able to tell a noticeable difference in her health and energy levels. I used to feed her Purina One dry food, but after a ton of research and questions, I'm slowly figuring out what she really needs to thrive. Wellness uses human-grade ingredients, and while I don't care for the Guar Gum or Carageenan additives, it's still a product worth buying.<br /><br />With regards to the one star rating, shame on you for buying from a breeder, and for passing up "health food" for your pets. Just because they can survive on cheap food that doesn't use natural ingredients, doesn't mean it's good for them. Children can survive on a diet of sugar cereal and cheeseburgers, but no responsible parent would feed that to them, either. If you love your kids, you make them eat their vegetables.<br /><br />In conclusion, it may take a little while for your kitty to accept natural food that isn't filled with nasty additives and flavorings to make it stinky, but when they do you will see an improvement! I also recommend Natural Balance canned food, another good quality diet. Raw food is best, but high quality canned food is still head and shoulders above dry kibble diets.

review/summary: The best in the U.S. market today.
review/text: About the only thing wrong I can find with Wellness canned is the number of people who complain that their cats won't eat it -- even cats that were eating Wellness for awhile, suddenly they seem to lose interest.  People scramble to find why their cat suddenly won't eat it ("they've been eating Wellness for years!"), and end up blaming it on the company.<br /><br />It's not necessarily the company's fault. It's at least partially your fault for creating a routine in which you allowed your cat to become so finicky.<br /><br />As a human, there are a few brands I prefer simply because I grew up with them, and I know the taste of those brands blind-folded. I'm finicky about them.  Cats are *super*-sensitive and can taste even the smallest changes - including the plant their can of food was processed from!!!<br /><br />Don't let your cat become so finicky by feeding only one brand or flavor or variety consistently for years.  Mix it up.  Wellness may be the best, but there are several high-quality brands of canned cat food on the market in the U.S. today -- look into them.<br /><br />I highly recommend rotating a few brands of high-quality canned foods if you have any problems with feeding Wellness to your cat, and even if you're not. Wellness is still a great brand of food (the best in my opinion), still containing the same high-quality ingredients as it ever did.  My cat loves it and I feed several flavors (Chicken, Beef & Chicken, Turkey) as part of his rotation.

review/summary: Different Poduct Than What's in the Store.
review/text: We decided to buy this from Petco through Amazon instead of going to their store to get it. It was a little cheaper and it saved us a trip. To our surprise, the product isn't the same color or consistency as what we have purchased from their stores for the last few years. To make matters worse, one of our cats has suddenly developed a swollen lower lip. This can be due to an allergic reaction, and it makes us wonder if it's a response to the obviously different product we received and fed to them.<br /><br />Update 5-27-10:  As noted above, the first two cases were different than what's in the stores. Our next order was normal color and consistency. Looks like a Quality Control issue. I'll update further about our experience.

review/summary: Our cats no longer will touch any of it.
review/text: We are involved with cat rescue, and prefer to give canned, no-grain food.  Between ours and the ones we're fostering until we find them homes, we have 43 cats.  MOST of the cats won't touch Wellness anymore.  They used to eat it and it was all they were given, so I can't imagine why, for the past several months, they are refusing it.  Today, we threw two more cans (Chx & Beef and Chx flavors) down the disposal.  We can't afford to throw the stuff away, so we're now looking for other no-grain canned food they'll eat.  It's ridiculous.  It's almost as if the recipe changed, and it's across the board, with all flavors - we also give them the poultry and salmon (purple can) and the turkey (green can) formulas, in addition to the two I already mentioned.  Same thing.  We wonder what's in there they no longer will eat.

review/text: We bought a case of this cat food and our cats liked it and seemed to do well.  After it was gone, we bought a 2nd case and all 3 of our cats became violently ill and vomited after eating it.  Thought it might have been a bad can so we tossed what was left.  Gave them another can the next day and same thing, all three cats became sick, vomited, lethargic and stopped eating for several days.  We went back to a food from our vets and now after several days they are OK again and eating normally.  I don't know if this was just a bad case of food or if Wellness has a quality control problem, but I would hesitate to purchase another product from Wellness.

review/summary: Superior nutrition at excellent savings
review/text: My 14 year old feline - Archie - was diagnosed with diabetes 2 weeks ago.  His diet for the previous 6 years consisted solely of Science Diet (adult/senior/light/age defying)kibble and a small amount of Friskie's canned at dinner time.  Per his veterinarians instructions to feed only high quality canned (wet) foods, I purchased Science Diet MD for diabetic cats.  Over the course of the following 3 days, there was no significant change in Archie's blood glucose which prompted me to start investigating cat foods a little more thoroughly.<br /><br />As stated on the Science Diet MD label, their carbohydrate content tested at 13%.  This seemed very high to me as diabetes maintenance is nearly ALL about carbohydrates.<br /><br />I discovered that Wellness brand Chicken tested at 4% carbohydrates. The fat content, at 60%, is higher than I'd like, but I'm okay with that, at least for the time being.  Archie's blood glucose plummeted 100 points within 24 hours of his first meal of Wellness Chicken.<br /><br />At less than $3.00 per 12.5 oz. (Amazon price PLUS free shipping)compared to Science Diet MD at $2.75 per 5.5 oz., Wellness also wins in the cost category. A double win X2 as I live in Alaska which is prone to unnecessary and outrageous shipping fees from unscrupulous/lazy vendors.<br /><br />Wellness Chicken is not vegetable free - it does contain peas and potato fillers (among others) but it is grain free which is also in it's favor.  Cats, after all, are carnivores.  It makes sense to me that their diet reflect this as much as possible/affordable.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Wellness Rocks...!!!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Wellness, as well as a few other holistic brands of animal food. I am new to this product, as we have just been adopted by a brother and sister pair. This is even better than the adult formula we were giving them in the mean time, because this satiates them by giving them more of what they need, so I actually have to feed them less.<br /><br />To those poo-pooing the fruits, veggies, seeds etc., the protein and fat content are the highest you can find outside of making it yourself, and you would still find yourself having to add these items. Even though cats are true carnivores and most wouldn't eat these other things by themselves in the wild, the fact is is that they DO eat non-meat items, when they eat their prey. They don't just eat muscle, they also eat the contents of the intestines, stomach, crops, and gizzards, and many try to get in the skull for the fats and lipids (because most wild prey will be very lean this is often the only place to get them). The trick is getting everything in the right proportions, and using actual, nutritious food.<br /><br />The price, yes, it is more. But, my family has had many, many, animals over the last 25 years, and we have seen the difference that a GOOD diet makes. And in the long run, it can help save an awful lot in vet bills.

review/summary: Healthy, and kittens dig it
review/text: I recently took home two bengal kittens, and wanted to do everything "right", learning from past mistakes, and one of the mistakes I had made in the past was not researching cat nutrition enough.  So this time I did.  There are quite a few top quality foods out there that aren't full of grain and "meat-meal", but I chose wellness because it is a bit more affordable, and is popular enough to be available at local pet stores as well as online.<br /><br />Now the big hurdle...do the kittens accept it?  Well, mine sure did.  I was a bit worried because they had been eating mostly Royal Canin dry food at the breeders house, but they took to it immediately and now are very passionate about dinner time.  Excellent!  I couldn't be happier.  Expensive?  Yes, unfortunately it is, but it is actually cheaper than Royal Canin and several of the others and in the case of Royal Canin, it has *much* better ingredients!  Do the research yourself and see, don't take my word for it!

It used to be that we could only get them to eat Fancy Feast, then after they tried Fancy Feast Medlies, they wouldn't eat the regular Fancy Feast anymore. Now the only thing they'll eat is Natural Balance & Wellness, which are even more expencive, though they're not at all picky about cereal or treats. So we're spending about $80 a month on wet cat food, $100 if you include cereal & litter, & this is with a Petco discount.<br /><br />I'm not really pleased with the inclusion of vegetables though; our vet told us that cats cannot digest plant matter & that it only serves to make them poop more. Alos either Natural Balance or Wellness is giving our kittens random boughts of diarrhea.

review/summary: Cats Love This; Doesn't Smell Like Bad Cat Food
review/text: Our cats love this.  We switched to this for half of their meals from regular dry food to help with urinary problems with one of the cats and to get them away from carb-rich food.  The cats really, really like this and have lost some weight over using Iams dry, weight-loss, hairball formula, which was one of the goals of changing their food.  Also, with it being moist food I can easily add a joint supplement to our older cat's food.  The only downside, like most moist food, is that the cats started having hairballs again.  This is why we give them this for only half of their meals and use dry food for the other half.  I switched their dry food also, but to a brand that isn't sold here, so I won't mention the brand.<br /><br />We love that this doesn't smell bad or give our cats digestive problems.  Cheaper moist cat food smells horrible and upsets our cats' digestive systems (which also smells horrible ;)).  I like that this is made with "human grade" ingredients.  I think this must account for the smell.  It smells pretty much like tinned meat a human would eat, like tinned chicken or fish.

review/summary: Best quality cat food I've seen
review/text: We moved our two Bengals from canned Fancy Feast chicken and turkey to Wellness Chicken.  It resolved a diarrhea problem quickly-- we think one of the cats became allergic to something in that Fancy Feast.  They enjoy Wellness much more; they have never attacked any food or treat more voraciously, even real chicken.  Plus, the litter box does not smell as bad, and I feel better about giving them food without nasty byproducts.  This is described as human-quality food, though I haven't been brave enough to try, I believe it.  Instead of smelling like a bag of fast food that got stuck under the seat in my car for a month, this smells like chicken soup.<br /><br />We tried getting our boys onto Avoderm, which definitely made their coats shinier and softer, and even increased their activity level (hard to believe for these Bengals).  However, once the mix got to be over 50% Avoderm, they didn't like the taste.  Can't give a low rating to any cat food because of taste.<br /><br />One note about shipping-- the packaging has not been perfect, but it's not nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers say.  The second case I received had a few cans with minor dents, but nothing was leaking.  The shipping box is larger than the case, with air-filled plastic pillows to fill the voids.<br /><br />This is not the least expensive food out there, but you are getting a better product.  We think it is worth it.

review/text: My two cats love this food!  I normally buy the chicken and the beef/chicken formulas and have been using it ~ 2 yrs now.  High quality ingredients with no corn or preservatives are a priority for me since my cats previously had issues with allergies and dander.  My cats no longer have dry skin and now only have some seasonal allergies instead of year round problems.<br /><br />The negative is that Wellness food is expensive.  I'm always on the lookout for coupons and I buy larger quantities in wet and dry food to save.  I only give my cats wet food once a day and use a feeder with a timer to ration out dry food for the rest of the day.

review/text: Our three cats don't like this variety. Probably because of the herring.<br />You would figure thyey would love the fish but I guess has too much of a fish odor.

review/summary: Most of the Cans Were Dented
review/text: I've been ordering a lot of these. Many of these go directly to my daughter's house. This is to let people know that most of the cans in these packages are DENTED. In the beginning I had thought it was an occasional can or two but I see in the last shipment that all of the cans were dented. It was just a matter of degree. However, when I purchased these at the retail store, none were dented. I think this is a good enough reason for me to think twice about buying these via Amazon in the future. I don't believe the price difference is all that much. I would hate for my cats to get botulism from the poor quality of the cans.

review/summary: Dented Cans AGAIN!
review/text: I love the Wellness Chicken Formula.  Great ingredients, solid reputation, and my cats like it (not as much as Weruva, but they don't waste).<br /><br />Amazon used to ship these is ridiculously oversized boxes with a foot of bubble wrap on every side.  It was overkill, but the canned goods arrived without a dent every single time.<br /><br />Now, on my third shipment in a row, at least one can is dented, and we are talking massively dented to the point where on this 12oz can if you put another on top it won't stand straight because the top is now at an angle.  The problem is they use these tiny boxes barely large enough to contain the cat food cans, and the bubble wrap is just these extra large bubbles only placed on two of the four sides, leaving two sides exposed to UPS who inevitably dents most of the cans on those sides.<br /><br />I don't consider this UPS's fault, as they handle so many packages they can't afford to treat them like raw eggs, its Amazon's fault for repeat inadequate shipping.  I am definitely not renewing my prime account.

review/summary: I want to love this stuff, as the ingredients are great, but: diarrhea.
review/text: Pretty sure this stuff is giving all six of my foster kittens diarrhea, which neither their dry kibble (Blue Buffalo Wilderness Kitten) nor their alternative wet food (Fancy Feast Classic grain-free varieties) do. I don't think they absorb much in the way of nutrition when the food shoots right through them, and of course it's a messy experience for me. Not a fan of this product.

review/summary: Canned Kitty food
review/text: One of my cats developed a urinary tract infection that caused both of us great suffering.  Kitty was two years old and I had only ever fed her dry food.  After getting things under control with the vet meds and UTI foods I added Wellness Adult Chicken Canned Cat Food to kitties diet.  She eats about 2 oz of this a day and some dry food, a combination of Royal Canin Urinary SO33, which she doesn't like very well and Purina One Salmon & Brown Rice formula which both cats love.  Kitty does prefer this wet food over the dry and will eat the wet if it is available.<br /><br />So far the UTI cat is still UTI free and my other kitty who only eats the Purina One is also UTI free.  My finicky kitty will only eat the dry food.

review/summary: Poor Packaging
review/text: First let me say that the product itself is excellent and I have no problems with it. This review is mainly about Amazon's idea of proper packaging. I ordered this with super saver shipping and it will be the last time. from now on I will order from another vendor and pay for shipping.<br /><br />When I received the package it was stained and 3 cans had been so severely damaged that they were leaking, 2 others were questionable and 7 others were severely dented but safe to use( I work in a canning facility so I know how to test vacuum in cans). The product was packaged with no padding at all in a box that was a good deal larger than the item. I saved no money at all on free shipping as I had to discard 5 cans of an already expensive cat food.

review/text: 1st: my cats really don't eat this brand with much relish like they did when Wellness had the mylar bags. We really miss those bags, the food just seemed to taste better to my cats. Canned, they won't touch any flavor but turkey.<br /><br />2nd: I've had 3 out of 12 in a case smell off and even the dogs won't touch it. So just check yours JIK.<br /><br />What has happened to this brand? They were the BEST 2 years ago!

review/summary: She eats it but it's like pulling teeth
review/text: I was disappointed to have spent the money and then find that my cat does not really like this food.  She will eat it if she's starving and even then I have to sit near and coax her.  She loves Fancy Feast and I only feed her the non-seafood ones and the ones that do not contain wheat gluten (both cause allergic reactions in her) so that narrows her diet down to the FF classic turkey, chicken, and beef.  I hoped to add some variety with this Wellness and hoped to get away from buying cat food with by-products in it but Wellness chicken is not the answer.  It's too thick and sticky.  Too bad for me because it smells WAY better than the Fancy Feast.

review/summary: Wellness Review Turkey/Salmon
review/text: We've been purchasing direct from retail stores, either PetSmart or Felix & Oscar's in Springfield, VA.  The condition of the cans shipped was not as good as I would have hoped.  Several cans were dented in each shipment.  Quality of the cat food is very good; cost savings may outweigh the shipping issues and the convenience of not going to the pet store.

review/summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

review/summary: Expensive, but my cat is thriving on it
review/text: I decided to switch my cat's food because she was having all kinds of problems:  excessive throwing up, urinary tract issues, and significant weight loss that the vet couldn't explain.  I switched her from Kirkland dry and Friskies Turkey Pate canned to Wellness dry and Wellness chicken formula, and it's been almost an overnight miracle.  She's put on at least a pound in 3 weeks (she eats an entire 5.5 oz can plus dry food every day--no more pushing the food around and not really eating), no more straining on the litter box, and she hasn't barfed in over a week!  I'm really impressed at what a difference this food has made for my cat's health.

review/summary: Wellness Cat Food
review/text: Since cats are obligate carnivores, high protein and very low carbs are a must for keeping your companion animals happy & healthy. When you read the cat food labels you will see that Wellness has eliminated the grain, useless fillers and by-products from their formulas.My kitties love all the flavors and will always come back for more. Just remember when changing to a new food to start gradually by adding a small amount to their regular food and keep increasing until you replace the old with the new. This is one of the best and healthiest cat food on the market and it was NOT involved in the massive pet food recalls of couple years ago.

review/summary: The recipe or ingredient quality has changed (?)
review/text: I am on the board of an animal shelter, and have 23 cats of my own.  We were directed to Wellness as an excellent no-grain food.  We buy the largest sized cans, and we spend almost $800 per month on this food.  The cats used to love all of the flavors we bought (Turkey, Chx, Chx and Beef, Turkey and Salmon) and suddenly NONE of them will eat ANY of them!  I can only surmise that something has happened to the recipe, or the quality of the ingredients.  It makes no sense.  More bizarre, we feed the outdoor (feral) cats the food and many of them won't touch it, either.  The hunt is on to find the next "great food"...

review/summary: So Far, So Good.....
review/text: Since I got this for my elderly, frail cat who turns up her nose at a lot of canned food, I guess I'll rely on her judgment for the review.  She thinks it's pretty good.  I bought a case without her even trying it (didn't have at my local pet store) by reading testimonials about it on different sites and because she'll usually eat something with chicken.  I like that nutritionally, it looked like a very high quality, digestible cat food. It worked out, as she's eating it.  Hopefully, it will even help her put on a little weight, but just the fact she likes it and isn't throwing it up is a big plus.  I think getting it on Amazon is the way to go because cheaper AND got delivered quickly and free shipping.
