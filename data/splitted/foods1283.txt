review/summary: whips up good as fresh
review/text: I've always used fresh egg-whites and not worried about them being raw. Now that I have small children, I thought pasturized would be the way to go. I was a little doubtful as I added water and watched the powder just float around - mixing didn't help. then, after about 2 minutes - voila! perfect eggwhites. They act just like fresh in cooking. I've used them in royal icing and merengues.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I had ordered this product some time ago but hadn't used it as I still had a little of the "Just Whites" product left.  I tried it the first time this week and was very pleased at the results.  It blended with the water much better that the other product I had been using, and looked and whipped up just as a fresh egg white would.<br /><br />The only negative I could add is that there was no directions for using for a small batch of whites.  I used the proportions from the "Just Whites" can and it worked perfectly with this.

review/summary: Does not whip up as high as HONEYVILLE brand
review/text: I have used the Honeyville brand over the last two years.  As a professional baker it matters a lot to me that the egg whites whip up high.  These do not whip as high.  Also, I discovered that it takes 3tsp of this product compared with 2tsp of the other to mix with 1 T of water to equal one white.  That makes this product more expensive than I had thought.

review/summary: Doesn't dissolve easily
review/text: I bought this product because a review I read said it dissolved easily.  It doesn't dissolve in cold broth, it just clumps up, and heating the mess cooked the egg powder into hard lumps.  When one is nauseous from chemo and trying to get some nutrition down, this is NOT satisfactory.  If there is a secret method of how to make this work, it wasn't on the packaging.

review/summary: Yummy and convenient
review/text: We love the 8oz size but have to make a special trip to the health store to find them. They stock a limited supply of the 4 pack, so buying in bulk and having it delivered is so much less expensive and less of a hassle.<br /><br />We typically store a few in the refrigerator for the kids at all times. Very convenient size to grab for a sack lunch. Although there is a tab that is supposed to be removed before inserting the straw, we don't. The sharp part of the straw goes through the tab fairly easily, and the kids don't spill any.<br /><br />It is very nice that these do not require refrigeration unless they are opened. But it is rare that they are not finished in one sitting :)

review/summary: A new found friend
review/text: I am the only person in my family who will drink Silk Pure Almond with Vanilla.  As much as I love it it was almost impossible to drink a whole half gallon by myself.  These little packets (2" x 2" x 5" high with a little straw attached) have become special to me.  Only 90 calories per unit. There is added sugar in the form of "all Natural evaporated cane juice" and those who have to watch their carb intake should take note of this. Added sea salt is at 150 mg or 6% per unit.<br />I recently went on a subscription for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDS6Q">Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli, 40-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> and as the cereal is best if allowed to soak overnight in milk or another liquid, it was a pleasant surprise how delicious the Pure Almond was in this Muesli.<br />I will continue to buy this product and recommend it to my friends.

review/summary: Great Tomatoes Once they were packed more carefully
review/text: This is the first time I have purchased this brand of whole canned tomatoes.  Judging by the taste they are about the same as other quality canned whole tomatoes.  They were very tasty and I am glad they are organic.<br /><br />There were actual tomato leaves in the can.  Like many other nightshades, tomato leaves and stems contain atropine and other tropane alkaloids that are toxic if ingested. I hope the cooking of them helped destroy the toxins, because I just ate the whole can... 7 Roma tomatoes minus the 3-4 leaves. At least Some of the tomatoes were partially unpeeled.<br /><br />Also almost all the cans were dented.  They were packaged in a very flimsy large box. Not very professional.<br /><br />I won't purchase them again.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The leaves inside the can are  BASIL LEAVES NOT TOMATO LEAVES.  I only leave the above-reference to the tomato leaves to help others know they are poisonous.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon customer service.  They are going to send me another box and hopefully they are not dented like the first one was.  If they are.  They will refund me they say.<br /><br />SECOND UPDATE:  The second case arrived and they were not dented at all... mainly because this time they came in a box and inside another box with padding around the inner box.  Customer service at Amazon was very helpful and as soon as I told them of the problem of the original order's dents they immediately remedied the problem.  Way to go, Amazon!!!  Yes, I will definitely purchase them again.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: I don't eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites. They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special. The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been sprinkled on. Some chips have minimal flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most. Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes. I wish that these chips had more than just a "hint" of lime.

review/summary: Two Paws Up!
review/text: My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them.<br /><br />But I needn't have worried, they loved it! The Tuna Too Cool is a rich-looking, reddish pate with lots of jelly on top and my twosome were wolfing their portions down and got into a bit of a scuffle over the last couple of mouthfuls. They have no higher praise.

review/summary: They like it!
review/text: I learned recently that cats are not supposed to have GRAINS in their food. It causes them health problems, including weight problems. The first few days of trying this I couldn't decide if they were liking it or not. They had always eaten dry food. After a few days on this canned they really started to show that they were liking it. It is a little chunky, but the chunks are easily smoothed out - it's also better to add some warm water with this to make it a little soupy. If it has been refrigerated, let it get to room temperature. All 3 cats like this as well as the Tuna Too Cool and the one that has Shrimp and Chicken combined - but they didn't like salmon.

review/summary: Please understand what it means to go grain free.....
review/text: This product is a good product and really good health wise for your cats. If you are looking at this product you are probably interested in feeding your cats something better. I just wanted to address some of the negative reviews of this food - many of them by people who don't understand that all cat food is not the same. I took the time to switch my 8 year old street rescue Louie to grain-free food (tried many brands before I arrived at BFF), and here are some of my observations.<br /><br />Cost<br />All grain free foods costs more for the same reason that grass-fed antibiotic free, free range chicken costs more per lb than a chicken nugget. It's better for your cat! Anyone who has a cat that's on a farm - ever see it eating some of the corn or wheat that spills off of the truck? Never! That is because cats don't eat grains. In cheap cat foods these grains are used as fillers to round out the portions and are not of any nutritional value to the cat. When I went grain free my cat ate much, much less - thereby negating the price difference. I even tested it a couple of times - my 13 lb cat can eat 2 - 3 ounce cans of Fancy Feast in one sitting - but cannot eat a 3.3 ounce can of BFF in one sitting.<br /><br />Another point on cost. If you are the type to take your cat to the vet and take care of it when it is sick, then you save so much money and trouble with foods like this it is crazy. When you hear people talk about diabetic cats, food allergies and all the other assorted sicknesses our animals are getting - most of them come from food. Diabetic cats - did they continuously raid the cookie jar? All the money you think you will save (but are not actually saving) will go to the health care of your pet in later years. Its the same way McDonalds and Denny's don't have to absorb the cost of all the diabetics they helped create - the taxpayers pay for it through Medicare and higher insurance costs 30 or so years down the line (and sooner with all the young diabetics we are creating).<br /><br />Smell<br />Most grain free cat foods smell. EVO stank up the house horribly and I had to move the cat bowl from the kitchen. Minus all the fillers and grains - you are getting an all natural product that is better for your cat because nutrition of the cat is put first.<br /><br />Taste<br />Cat's are notoriously finicky. Most cat foods that have grains and other filler ingredients have to add heavy syrupy mixes to get the cats to eat them. They take corn, wheat, soy, barley and gods know what else, add some vitamins and then add a extremely strong tasty syrupy mix to get the cat to swallow it all. So cats fed this for a period of time get used to it the same way babies get used to sugars in their formula. Then, when you want to give the baby vegetables with no sugar added guess what? Baby rejects them - they want the sugar! Same happens with cats fed with cheap filler foods.<br /><br />Poop<br />When switching to grain free a cats habits and consistency may change. Their digestive system is learning how to digest what it was actually made for. Same thing happens to humans - look up the "Whole 30" and see what I mean.<br /><br />Switching to Grain Free<br />Its a process more involved than opening the can and plopping it down. Took me months. Google can help you do it but don't expect to just give this to your cat and have her dive right in thanking you for it. That may happen, but more likely than not you have to mix old and new foods until they are used to it.<br /><br />BFF, EVO, Taste of the Wild.... they are all good brands that will improve the health of your cat. I settled on BFF as my wet food because he loves it. I used to give him EVO wet food and he would eat it but he hated it. I still feed him EVO dry food because he likes it. I tried many brands and did not give up on grain-free food because I cared about my cat. I understood as a street cat for years he was used to eating whatever he could and it all was the cheapest, unhealthiest stuff available given to him by well meaning people. He has improved in every way (coat, activity level, temperament, litter habits, etc..) and now is a healthy and happy cat.

review/summary: Great grain free, high fiber, high moisture food!
review/text: My slightly aging cat has had horrible colitis in the last two years, and was defecating on the floor and my bed. The best solution I found was to switch to a grain free food, and offer more wet food than dry, so he will have more moisture in his bowels. I switched to Natural Care LDT, and it solved his problem...for about six months. After finding another steaming pile in my bed recently, and a few under my desk, I decided to try BFF, as my local pet store  just started carrying it. He is a picky feline, but he sucked the Tuna and pumpkin flavor down like a Hoover. One week later, happy cat, no more poop in my bed, which means happy girl. Great ingredients, and picky cat loves it!<br />Note: yes he saw the vet. The change in diet was the vets idea.

I try to use this brand, Tiki Cat, Weurva and then for dry food Orijen cat food.  My Himalayan cats are on a no grain, no gluten/filler diet.  This wet food in combination with the dry has led to great coats, no hair balls, good energy and solid not too stinky poo :)

review/summary: Another Hit From BFF!
review/text: I just tried my two four footed food critics on BFF's Tuna & Veggies Valentine and it made a big hit with both of them. It's always a risk trying a new food on my two finicky cats, but I hoped they would like this one because they love parent company Weruva's Tuna & Vegetables <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70O2">Weruva Mediterranean Harvest Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 24)</a>. BFF's tuna & veggies is a bit different from Weruva's - it has red tuna instead of white and a slightly thicker consistency, though both are stew like and have visible chunks of veggies. And both have an ingredient list that meets my standards - no by products. My twosome snarfed up every last bit of tuna and veggies valentine that I gave them and they asked me for more - but they will have to wait until tonight for that!

review/text: I've recently switched my cats to all grain free food. (if you still feed your cats (or dogs!) with grain filled food, especially if you have had a problem with bladder or kidney stones, I implore you to look at the reviews and research of grain free food.) That being said, my ragdoll usually only eats dry food and my shorthair usually eats the wet food. Amazon delivered this to my doorstep today and I opened a can and fed it right away to see if they liked it. After taking a shower I came back out and it was ALL gone, and my ragdoll was finishing up what little was left. The cat food box says on the front that it was made in a human food facility, but I don't know much about cat food that isn't made in a human food facility. I still appreciate the fact that they are trying to say it is higher quality. I will probably be buying this brand from now on, I just wish Amazon Prime members got it in two days like usual, but it is shipped from pet food direct so :(.

review/summary: Energetic Cat!
review/text: I recently adopted a kitten just under a year old. At first we thought there was something wrong with her, she wouldn't do normal crazy kitten things. After reading about cat nutrition, I discovered what I had fed to my cats as a kid was completely backwards, as is most 'cat food' even today. I read about BFF and decided to let her try some. Now my cat doesn't rest all day, but is playful and as crazy as a kitten should be. Also of note, there is much more urine in her litter box each day, which is a good sign of how much water is in the food. She's also volunteering her presence more now, not just when she is hungry. I had to take a star off, not because of the product, but since Amazon doesn't let me order more than 2 packs per flavor. I'd give it 6 stars if I could 'subscribe' as you can with other types of food on Amazon.<br /><br />Also, I would recommend the 3oz cans if you have only one cat. You will have to feed him/her more throughout the day, but it can dry out if they don't finish it, which defeats some of the purpose besides being unappetizing to the cat.

review/summary: Carrageenan ingredient NOT good !
review/text: If your cat has GI or stomach problems, be SURE to read the ingredients on the label as several of the BFF flavors contain Carrageenan which is not at all healthy for your cat (or people for that matter).  It causes GI problems and heartburn -- the very last thing a kitty needs.  It does NOT appear that Carrageenan is listed in the Amazon description, but if one checks the BFF website, you can find complete product ingredients.<br /><br />In particular, this BFF has the Carrageenan listed towards the top of the ingredient list, so more highly concentrated.<br /><br />My cat needs grain-free food for her IBD and I purchased a few cans of this BFF locally.  The "Carrageenan" on the label got me to sleuthing and discovered some food makers (pet and human) use this as a filler.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Just a heads up for folks ..!

review/summary: Absolute Life Saver!
review/text: My 14 year old kitty's mouth does not work so well anymore, and she has trouble eating most of the grain free wet foods, which tend to be too chunky or solid. This awesome wet food is full of jelly and broth as well as meat, and it's PERFECT for an old kitty's mouth. She has not eaten a full helping of cat food in YEARS, but the very first can of this stuff I set out for her was GONE almost instantly. She is usually constantly screaming for treats, but after having a full 3 ounce can of this, she is happy and scream free. I have never seen her take to a wet food so instantly and so completely. Yes, it smells like tuna...because it's made from tuna? It's pungent but she frickin' LOVES it. How nice to see my poor old girl eat every last bit of something. I am just so grateful I found this food! Will be ordering it on a regular basis. Thanks, BFF!

review/summary: This stuff is kitty crack
review/text: The BFF line is great; my cats adore it (to the point of occasionally going on food strike when I try to get them to eat other things), its fairly reasonably priced and aside from the mercury issues, it's a really healthy catfood lacking all the crud that's usually in commercially prepared foods (bad additives, grains, corn etc).<br /><br />This particular flavor (tuna and shrimp) is their favorite, but I also feed the tuna and pumpkin flavor which is a close second.  The only reason that I don't feed this 100% of the time, is because just like with humans, you have to be a little concerned about the amount of mercury in fish.  Nothing to do specifically with this brand - they do everything right.  It's just not the healthiest thing in the world to feed nothing but tuna - the mercury levels can build up and that isn't good.  So I alternate this with a chicken product.<br /><br />Otherwise - this is top notch catfood.

review/summary: Good price
review/text: My cat is used to eating Weruva and Tiki Cat, so I wasn't sure how he would take to this brand. This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!) I'd buy this stuff again in the future if I was in a pinch, as it's not a bad food...I just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed "stuff". But good ingredients and grain free at a good price!

Even my roommate's cat, who is extremely picky with wet food (to the point that there is literally only one brand he would eat at all) has been caught sneaking tastes out of her bowl now! This stuff is very high grade - if you check out the b.f.f. site, they make all of their items in a human food processing facility, and there is no grain filler in the food. When opening the cans, it really smells like something you'd open up to eat yourself! I love this product and I will continue to buy it for my baby.

review/text: Two of my cats are very picky eaters most of the time and will only eat kibble or straight up canned tuna. They even turn their noses up at canned salmon and sardines. Even though this food is all fish, I was afraid they might snub it, too, and they normally don't like canned cat foods at all. But they love this. The food has a lot of tuna, but you can tell it has the chunks of tilapia in it. My cats didn't hesitate to eat all of it. I intend to try the other flavors to get some variety in their diet.<br /><br />And I liked that this canned food is very densely packed, not soupy. I just add a little water if the cats need it wetter.

review/summary: Extremely high quality cat food at affordable price
review/text: I love BFF by Weruva because it's incredibly healthy, with only quality meats and supplements and no grains or by-products, but is so much cheaper than any other "premium" brand of comparable quality out there.  I don't even know how they manage to keep the price so reasonable.  The difference in quality is obvious when you open the can, as the food hasn't been ground into unrecognizable oblivion but still has identifiably shredded meat and looks a healthy flesh color, not some unsatisfying 'blah' brown.  I'm a student, so I'm on a very tight budget, but it's worth it to me to purchase BFF for my cats because I believe in preventative care.  Feed my cats well from the beginning and they'll live long, healthy, happy lives with less health problems that will leave me with expensive vet bills.  As for now, my cats and kitten gobble it up in a second flat.  It's obvious they love every flavor I've tried with them (and one is even quite picky).  Their fur is like silk, too.  This is clearly a great food.

review/summary: BFF Tuna and Bonito Be Mine, 5.5 oz. 8-pack
review/text: I recently upgraded to higher quality canned food, first trying the standard Weruva offerings and now the BFF (a Weruva sub-brand?) I like that BFF offers flavors with gravies and others with aspic, as it increases feeding time variety. BFF is certainly a good value compared to the other high-end natural and grain-free products, and even my pickiest senior guy enjoyed the tuna and bonito variety. I will continue purchasing the standard Weruva in Paw Lickin' Chicken since my boys love it, but we are happy to mix it up with BFF. The inclusion of the skin on some fish pieces is certainly a confidence-booster that my cats are getting real food, not mystery meat. I also appreciate the 5.5 ounce can size, as we can share a can each feeding and both cats get their fill.

It was something I wanted because the majority of BFF (and Soulistic, made by the same company) are tuna based (other fish added too, but mostly tuna and fish).  Once in a while it would be nice to have something else;  we get tired of the same thing every meal too!  In general the BFF foods are a good choice - better quality, not outrageous prices.

review/text: My cats have rejected Tuna and Chicken Chuckles, but I'm only docking it one point for that because I don't think it is the food's fault. It looks just fine, mostly red tuna mixed with shreds of chicken, (there is way more tuna than chicken, the chicken shreds are almost like a condiment). My cats like other flavors of BFF, they just wolfed down a plate of Tuna Too Cool for dinner, but they do not like this one. I've tried feeding it to them several times and they just don't like it. One of them ate a bit of Tuna & Chicken Chuckles and threw it up and the other just refused to touch it. My cats are really picky, though. I'll donate the rest of the case of this to my local shelter where I'm sure the kitties will find it a glorious treat and get my feline food critics something else.

review/text: Read the labels before you buy. All the flavors of BFF list the following two ingredients at the top of their lists: Tuna & water. Every can is just low quality, dark gray, shredded tuna.  The company adds a trace of other ingredients so they can claim to have several flavors, but don't fall for their tricks! Rather, when you want to give your kitty some tuna for a treat, just feed him/her some regular tuna--the good kind humans eat.  Not only is it far superior quality, but it's cheaper, too!

review/summary: Paws down from 2 out of 3 cats !
review/text: I am always looking for good quality cat food and thought I would give this a try.<br />Sadly it did not go down well in my house ! Two of my cats just walked away without a mouthful and the third ate about a quarter of a can. Whereas with Fancy Feast, they inhale it.<br />Maybe it's like humans, the stuff that is bad for you simply tastes better !

review/summary: Cat loves it, but it STINKS horribly
review/text: I've been feeding my cat this food for about 2 weeks and my cat loves it. However, I feed my cat in the dining room and I eat my breakfast in the living room because the food stinks and the smell lingers.<br /><br />My cat seems very healthy and always has lots of energy after his meal. He seems very healthy and excited to be fed and licks the can clean.<br /><br />But I think I'll return to Tiki Cat or Newman's Own. I change his litterbox at least twice per day because I will not have my house smelling like animal droppings. I will not tolerate foul cat food smell either.

review/summary: My cat is a picky eater
review/text: and she will evetually "give in" and eat this food, but she doesn't "dive right in" as I had hoped she would do. Granted, she is a picky eater and an elderly cat, but I had hoped she would really enjoy this brand of organic food. I do better to cook and grind my own food for her. Heck, I made baby food when my daughter was a baby what's the difference for an old, sickly kitty cat? As expensive as this brand of cat food is I probably save money making my own. I am disappointed, but when I am a poor, old lady on a fixed income and have to eat cat food so I can buy my meds under Obama-care this is the brand I want to eat!

review/summary: This stuff stinks literally!!!
review/text: My cat Joshua is 13years old, he has been with me through thick and thin, good times bad times, you name it. When times were hard, he had to rough it with cat food from the ninety nine cents store, no complaints he ate it up. Lately times have been good so I wanted to buy him something special hence my decision to buy Best Feline Friend, Talk about a emotionally based decision!! this stuff is horrible!! it truly smells worse than any cat food I have ever come across not to mention the fact that he will not even come near the stuff, one whiff and he is walking in the opposite direction. This stuff may be good for cats but if they don't even want to eat it, whats the point? Here's some advice save your money and buy your cat what is good for them but at the same time something they enjoy, that's what your best feline friend deserves, not this stuff.

review/summary: You get sugar when you buy sugar
review/text: I'll start by saying I normally use the Sugar in the Raw Turbinado sugar, but wanted to make the switch to support more local businesses. In comparison, the grains are much smaller than the Sugar in the Raw, and it's more similar to the white sugar everyone is used to. The Barry Farm Turbinado sugar has a potent "vegtable" smell, and doesn't seem to play too well with coffee because of this. The sweetness is still there, but the smell kind of ruins the coffee experience.<br /><br />I plan to try baking with the rest of the sugar, and I'll update my review.

review/text: I got this item, not from amazon, but at a local Korean Grocery at a much cheaper price. It was my first time to try it after numerous failed times of buying when I'm visiting Asian stores around the valley. The teriyaki flavor in the nori makes things interesting. My only gripe may be of how many small sheets u can eat in its bottle! Maybe next time I go back at Greenland Supermarket, I'll get more. It costs less than $2 per bottle so, that's way cheaper than the one advertised here at twice that price...! ;)

After moving to Glendale AZ finally found one store (an Italian Deli) that carried this brand.  I also had to pay around $4.00 a can but did so because this clam sauce is sooo good and well worth it.  Give it a try.  The price at a little over $2.00 a can is quite a bargain for me.

review/text: Yes, you heard me. This first of all is not a product of Italy. Amazon product description says it is.  Years ago, you could buy in the United States many brands of Italian white clam sauce  from Italy in a can. Those were far superior to anything sold today. For some reason , I guess it's just cheaper to make it here and make a bigger profit. Also, Americans are very easily pleased. Look at the size of us. We'll eat anything , as long as it is loaded with fat on top. So, after that being said, This sauce is good, as long as you doctor it up a bit with your own spices. Don't heat it up too much since the clams are already cooked.

review/text: Barley Malt powder is super healthy, since the sugars are largely Maltose, which do not produce a sharp sugar spike for diabetics.  I have tried just about every one available, and Barry Farms makes the best one of all.  The Barry Farms barley malt powder is sweeter tasting than most others and quick dissolving in milk.  I use it with straight cocoa powder and milk in a blender to make a tasty chocolate malted breakfast drink.  Two tablespoons of this only has 3 grams of sugar.  This is one great tasting health food.

review/text: I have always loved the flavor of malt in shakes.  However, I found most shakes were too sweet.  I wanted to add just the malt flavor without the sugar or sweetening agent.  This is it!  I finally found the malt flavor I have been looking for without all the added ingredients.  This pure malt powder is more likely to form lumps than a malted milk powder so a mixer or blender should be used.  If you're looking for just malt flavor , this is the one for you.

After recieved my package I mixed Zola's puree and some plain whole milk Kefir, and all I can say is WOW! This truly is the best tasting Acai I've ever had and will be setting up auto shipments. Also note that since this is a brazilian product they do add Guarana into the puree, thats how they like it down there. The guarana gave me a nice kick of caffiene, not too jittery. A great way to start the day, and a great coffee substitute.

review/summary: California to Pennsylvania in a padded envelop.
review/text: Received my order quickly, in about 3 days.<br />When it arrived via USPS, it was in a white, plastic, bubble-padded envelop.<br />Inside was a clear plastic bag, which contained the White Labs vial.<br />Taped around the vial was one a gel-based ice pack to try and keep the yeast cold during transport. It wasn't cold upon arrival.<br /><br />While I was happy with the speed of the delivery and was impressed with the ingenuity, I was lucky to find that the ice pack was not broken. Which wouldn't have hurt the vial, but would have been a real mess for either myself or someone along the chain of transport. Hence the 4 out of 5 star rating.<br /><br />I chose this yeast for a hefeweizen I recently brewed. The price was extremely affordable and the WPL300 yeast produces some nice banana and clove flavors. Just to be safe, I used a Yeast Starter to help resurrect any yeast cells that might not have made the trek. Instructions can be found here: [...]
