review/summary: Subtle and smooth
review/text: This Canadian tea carries on the great tradition of the fine English purveyors of what would seem to be Great Britain's national beverage (if one omits warm ale). I note with pleasure Higgins & Burke's participation in the Ethical Tea Partnership, details of which one can find on the Web. It is gratifying to find companies willing to commit to social and environmental responsibility.<br /><br />As to the tea itself, I chose to sample my favorite flavor, Earl Grey, often a good test for the ability of a tea manufacturer to provide just the right amount of distinctive flavor, which for Earl Grey is Bergamot, without overwhelming the taste of the tea itself. It passes that test admirably to the tongue but is a little lacking in aroma for the nose--mine at least. The tea, brewed according to the instructions--for about 4 minutes--is not too strong on the tannic acid, smooth rather than astringent like some teas.<br /><br />A quality product.

review/summary: Very flavourful
review/text: Lovers of Earl Grey tea come in various varieties. :) Contrary to the norm, I like my Earl Grey strong and sweetened. Though the Higgins and Burke version is not the most intense I have tried, it has a very pleasant flavour, with none of the 'liquorice' tones I've sometimes found in other brands. It is sufficiently full-bodied that one need not use multiple sachets to get a nice pot. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Not the Earl Grey flavor I expected
review/text: This didn't taste like either of the Earl Grey teas I love, namely Twinnings and Bigelow.  The bergamot flavor is extremely mild, to say the least, but the fragrance of the brewed tea smells a bit like perfumed soap--not tea.

review/text: I'm a big Earl Grey Black Tea drinker. This tea was flavorful, but not as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5QI">Twinings Earl Grey Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> or a Trader Joe's house brand that I buy. The flavor is more subtle and less pronounced. Food flavors like perfume essences are very personal. I prefer the more pronounced flavors in Earl Grey. If you prefer a lighter Earl Grey, you'll love this!

review/text: This is okay tea. I think of English Breakfast as being a big, bold, full-bodied tea, and on that measure this stuff falls short. With one teabag to a mug, it's pretty mild. The flavor and aroma are there, but you have to go looking for them; they don't jump up out of the cup and grab you by the lapels and give you a shake. I have to use two bags to a cup when I want a real English Breakfast experience, and that feels profligate.

review/summary: Good flavor but not consistent
review/text: This is a solid tea a bit stronger than most but hardly up there with the powerhouse sort of teas. I prefer a strong tea such as Twinings Irish Breakfast or Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Gold. This tea is a bit more complex than most others but in the few cups I've tasted, it doesn't seem consistent. I tend to steep my tea longer than usually recommended which I find imperative here to get the full flavor. No 3 minute steeps here or you'll surely find the tea weaker than it should be.<br /><br />The inconsistency is in flavor. Some cups have had a fruity slightly citrus complexity to them while others miss that.<br /><br />As a note, I drink my tea with nothing added using purified water as a base. The box states that this tea stands up well to use with milk and sugar. I think you'd end up with a candy-like confection adding those two but it's your choice, I suppose.<br /><br />The tea comes in individually foil wrapped bags and each bag has a string attached which is something I infer the British tea drinkers find redundant. Anyway, the foil wrap should guarantee fresh flavor which leaves me baffled at the somewhat inconsistent flavor between cups.

The Higgins and Burke English Breakfast tea is pretty mediocre in my opinion even though it is nicely packaged. Individuality bagged tea can deliver the taste and pleasure as loose teas plus its great when one doesn't have time or inclination to brew from scratch but don't expect that from this product.

review/summary: There are better brands out there
review/text: I'm a huge fan of tea and drink a LOT of it.  This is the first time I tried Higgins & Burke brand and have to say that I've never heard of it before.  English Breakfast Tea is probably my second favorite packaged tea to drink (Earl Grey being my first choice), but most brands I've tried are usually pretty similar.  Not so with this brand.  The aroma didn't seem as rich and flavor seemed somehow "off" to me, but I couldn't quite put my finger on what I didn't like until I read one of the other reviews here on Amazon and the reviewer described it as "musky."  That's about as accurate a description as I can think of.<br /><br />I like my tea strong (leaving the bag to steep the entire time I'm drinking it) and do not add sweetener or cream or lemon.  After trying the first cup, I knew that I'd have to add something so on my second mug I added a bit of sweetener and it helped take the musky edge off, but it still wasn't what I consider a flavorful English Breakfast blend.<br /><br />If you're a fan of traditional English Breakfast Tea I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F952">Twinings English Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010DLWT4">The Republic of Tea, British Breakfast Tea, 50-Count</a>, or even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000C69FB">Tazo Awake Black Tea, 24-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> over the Higgins & Burke brand.

review/summary: Comes in a easy dispensable box
review/text: The first thing I did was to sniff the box. The tea is so well sealed in its packets that the box smelled like a box. I suggest they put a little loose tea in the box to lure you in. Then I noticed a perforated section on the box to use your thumb to make an opening to dispense the packets.  Each serving comes in an individual foil packet with a little tear to show where to open the packet.  Inside the tea looks more like granules. They are sealed in the standard tea bag that has space in the middle when it unfolds. There is the tag tied to a string for dunking and extracting the bag after steeping. The ingredients description is black tea.<br /><br />The tea itself looks and tastes like the standard Lipton tea. If you close your eyes you cannot tell the difference.  It does have a nice dark amber look in a clear glass.  In my cup it left a little residue that could be seen when using a paper towel to clean it later.

review/summary: Very robust and musky
review/text: I've been a tea lover and connoisseur ever since I was 11 yrs old -- and I've enjoyed many types of teas from all over the world.<br /><br />However, I find this Higgins & Burke English BreakFast Black Tea to be musky with an almost oily aftertaste, and that does not please my palate. I tried it with sugar -- and then with cream -- and the musky taste is still overpowering. Now this robsutness/musky/oily taste might be something I would appreciate on a cold winter night, perhaps with some grains and butter added, like the barley and butter that are added to the tea that the Buddhist monks drink, to make Tsampa -- and I would not hesitate to try that, in the colder months, as the musky/robust tones of this tea might very well make a satisfying (Americanized) Tsampa.<br /><br />But frankly, this tea was meant to be enjoyed as a stand-alone brew, and unlike their WONDERFUL Early Grey tea, Higgins & Burke English BreakFast Black Tea, is not really my cuppa tea.

This black tea is the perfect way to start your day and it's also a great afternoon pick me up as well with an adequate amount of caffeine.<br /><br />I found the flavor to be quite robust! I tried drinking this tea as is, with sugar, as well as with milk and each way tasted delicious being uniquely different but in each way full of body. It also smells as wonderful as it taste.<br /><br />Each box of tea comes with twenty individually wrapped bags of tea which is good for space savings and ideal to take along with you wherever you may go. It also gives you tea that will stay  fresher longer. I like that the box  has a perforated edge so you can easily keep the bags inside the box too if you prefer.<br /><br />This tea company is totally thinking of the environment by using 100% recycled materials with a minimum 55% post-consumer in each and every tea box. I love too that all of this companies  black, green and white teas are 100 percent sourced and purchased under the Ethical Tea Partnership standards. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a exceptionally great tea from a company that is giving back in more than one way. And it's a great price too through Amazon's Subscribe and Save!

review/summary: Hearty Breakfast Tea with Robust Flavor
review/text: A cuppa Higgins & Burke English Breakfast Tea can be a delicious start to your morning or a great pick-me-up in the afternoon.  Delicious served alone, it tastes wonderfully with a splash of milk--somehow partnering with milk brings out a warm almost honey note of the tea that is comforting in its familiarity and association with a cheery kitchen filled with the aromas of a large and hearty breakfast.<br /><br />In fact, English breakfast tea was designed to compliment a large hearty meal.  Its toasty aroma combined with its robust full-bodied taste has a nice albeit slight aftertaste of light floral.  Supposedly created in Scotland it is usually a blend of black tea that includes  Assam, Ceylon, Kenyan and Keemun teas.  The English of the 19th century were fascinated by anything Chinese.  This tea was Anglicized by putting the "Engilish" in front of "Breakfast."  Its been popular since the days of Queen Victoria.<br /><br />Higgins & Burke's English Breakfast is a blend of rich and malty Assam and full-bodied and earthy Ceylon black teas.  Remember a black tea is black due to the level of oxidation that the tea leaf is exposed to during processing not because it comes from a different plant.  Also don't confuse English Breakfast tea with Earl Grey which has a citrus-y bergamot flavor or Lipton which is blended from over twenty different teas to achieve the distinct Lipton taste<br /><br />I drink my Higgins & Burke red--the Ceylon black tea produces a dark red liquor with a little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L048WO">Teavana German Rock Cane Sugar (1 lb)</a>.  One 8 ounce cup provides me with just the amount of caffeine I need to bolt me into my day when I am not waking up through exercise.  The preparation is simple:  Boil your water, pour over the tea bag and seep for as long as you choose.  I'd recommend around three minutes if you don't like your tea too strong.<br /><br />In terms of price, Twinings English Breakfast is definitely less expensive if bought in bulk.  Lipton's is more expensive.  However, I like the flavor of Higgins & Burke and the convenient packaging of receiving six 20-count boxes makes it easier for me to store.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Canadian company Higgins & Burke knows how to blend a nice cup of English Breakfast Tea at a reasonable grocery store price.  For tea drinkers everywhere, there is nothing as arousing as a brisk eight ounces of English Breakfast tea in the AM to jump-start your day with a familiar comfort beverage.

I tried steeping it an extra long time too but that didn't help.  The Bergamot is less compelling, and the tea taste is almost absent.  I cannot recommend this product.

review/summary: Hearty Flavor
review/text: I drink coffee at breakfast, but regularly enjoy a cup of tea in the early evening.<br /><br />For last night's tea, I used the Higgins & Burke English Breakfast blend. The first thing I noticed was the fresh aroma of the tea leaves inside the tea bag.  That was a nice start, as with some other brands, you smell nothing at all.<br /><br />After brewing the tea for about 4 minutes, I added sugar (2 scant teaspoons) and started sipping.  The tea had a strong, hearty taste, and that good aroma held on throughout the entire cup.<br /><br />Enjoyable!<br /><br />The packaging is also good. The box opens in a way that allows each individually packaged tea bag to drop to the bottom, where it is easy to remove. The individual packaging of each tea bag preserves freshness.<br /><br />The only reason I deducted one star from this rating is because I did notice a VERY SLIGHT bitter aftertaste when I finished the cup.  Not that it bothered me, but it might not be agreeable to those who object to any bitterness at all in their tea.

I have never enjoyed Higgins & Burke before, but am glad I was able to check it out.<br /><br />The tea comes nicely packaged in an eye-catching sturdy little box.  Each tea bag is handily sealed for freshness in its own private tea sachet.  When I took the tea bag out of the sachet I was immediately aware of how good the tea smelled.  It's very fragrant with a rich aroma, smelling somewhat floral.<br /><br />I take my tea with sugar and leave the bag in my mug the entire time while drinking.  The taste was full-bodied and rich, with a very flowery taste to it. This tea has a different and satisfying taste to it, not over-bearing or weak, just darn good.<br /><br />While duty called, my tea cooled off.  I decided to add some ice to see how that would taste.  WOW!  It tasted even better than while it was piping hot.  My next pitcher of ice tea will be made with Higgins & Burke Breakfast Black Tea.<br /><br />I think you would enjoy this tea; many have as Higgins & Burke have been around since 1912.  While I've always enjoyed Celestial Seasonings and Bigelow flavored teas, along with Twinings Earl Grey and our old stand-by Lipton, this tea drinker now can add another tea to her list of favorites.<br /><br />Higgins & Burke has a good many different varieties of tea to choose from.  This Breakfast Black Tea is made with Assam and Ceylon teas and is very good. If you enjoy tea and would like to try something a little different in the taste department, this tea would work for you.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Pam

review/text: Higgins and Burke makes a decent Earl Grey: it has a splendid burst of bergamot coupled with a rich blend of black teas.<br /><br />I like tea that has the ability to hold up to milk and sugar, even if I'm not having it with either. I often choose to not put milk in Earl Grey, but even then I still want it to have some pluck. This tea has pluck. Granted, it is not an Irish Breakfast but then there is a reason for that - if you filled a bag full of Assam then you would overpower the bergamot.<br /><br />Some teas can achieve that strength by filling their bags full of fannings. That is not what Higgins and Burke are doing. I took apart one of the bags to check. They are using real tea leaves. They aren't using fannings nor are they using crush-to-curl.<br /><br />I rate this as one of the better bagged Earl Greys.

review/summary: Great classic well done
review/text: Most tea lovers are very familiar with Earl Grey tea. Many first learned about it from Star Trek, since it was Captain's John Luc Picard's favorite hot drink. Earl Grey tea is black tea with the addition of oil(or other flavor elements) of bergamot(a citrus fruit mostly grown in Italy). This brand uses Asian black tea with oil of Italian bergamot. It has a very full bodied flavor and the bergamot also comes through prominently. It comes in stay-fresh foil packets. Another nice little feature is that each tea bag has a string attached with a stitch and no metal staple, so there are no metal staples or glues to affect the taste for purists. Highly recommended for those who appreciate black tea and also like citrus additions.

review/summary: Nice light chai flavor
review/text: Normally I prefer a strong chai that I brew from the actual spices and tea but this chai in individually wrapped bags imparts a delicate and pleasant taste.<br /><br />Higgins & Burke has been in the tea business for one hundred years. They pay attention to quality in all their teas and their chai made from select assam black tea, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and ginger is one example. I tried it with half and half, one time unsweetened, the other time with a little honey added. Both were equally pleasing.<br /><br />A perfect cup for sipping while curled up with a good book.

review/summary: Love This Chai
review/text: I have never heard of this brand but I'm glad I tried it. I've always drank Tazo Chai, so this is what I'm going to compare the higgins & Burke Chai to. When you take the Tazo and the H&B tea sachets out of the wrappers, both have a wonderfully spcy chai aroma. The difference is in the brewing. I didn't expect to prefer the Higgins & Burke over Tazo but I DO!!! It brews a nice "red" colored spicy cup of chai. No bitterness but the aroma and flavor is just as rich. It does not matter now long you leave the tea bag in your cup. On the contrary, the Tazo will become very dark and bitter. The bitter tea flavor of an oversteeped cup of chai masks the spices. I think I'm converting to H&B becuase the flavor is great. And no matter how long you steep you just can't go wrong with this blend. Every cup is delicious!!! I recommend you get some :) It comes in a pack of 6, but if you love it like I do, it won't last too long. Or you can share. Your co-workers are bound to ask to bum sum off you when they try it.

review/summary: It's a Decently Pleasant Tea...
review/text: Well, first off I should say that I'm not new to tea.  I'm not sure I'd describe myself as a "tea connoisseur" but I'm pretty experienced with tea.  I've tried just about every type of tea out there (white, black, green, herbal, even puerh tea!), and I regularly make my own custom blends using loose leaf herbs and spices.  I'm a pretty big fan of tea, so I naturally jumped at the chance to get some nice chai tea.  I already have my own homemade chai recipes that involve simmering loose spices and adding in milk and sugar, and it's great, but I've always wanted to try some plain chai without the milk.<br /><br />So I got the Higgins and Burk Chai in the mail and decided to brew myself a cup to try out.  I steeped it a full 10 minutes because I steep all my tea for 10 minutes (I suspect a lot of people would find this too strong for their tastes, but that's how I like it).  My first impressions of this tea is that it's pretty weak for a chai style tea.  I felt like the strongest taste was the cloves, and it really could've used stronger notes of ginger and cinnamon.  Not to mention, the black tea portion of it tastes a bit not-so-good to me.  It's difficult to describe, but I'll explain it as best as I can.  I once bought a huge box of cheap crappy pekoe black tea and it tasted terrible.  It was just lacking in good flavor and only tasted of bitter tannins and blandness and nothing else.  This tea is not nearly as bad as that one was, but the black tea portion of it seems to have a bit of that taste to it.  I had my own Assam tea (before I used it all and ran out) and it seemed to taste much better than this - even plain with nothing else in it!  Of course, it could've been because of the source of my teas/spices (I get everything from the mountainroseherbs website); maybe the tea is better from there.  Anyway, the other spices in the tea hide it well enough so it's not a big deal.  I did decide to make my own homemade blend to see how it would turn out using the same ingredients (I used 2 parts black tea, 1/2 part cinnamon, 1/8 part cloves, 1/8 part cardamom, and 1/2 part ginger).  Then I did a side by side taste test using the exact same amount of sweetener.  The Higgins and Burke version is not terrible or anything, but I still think my version won by a small margin.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're a casual tea drinker, this tea will probably be fine for your tastes, and far more convenient than making your own loose-leaf blends.  In addition, if you are the sort who prefers a less spicy chai then this tea would be great!  In the course of further usage, I also discovered that the Higgins and Burke tastes better as an iced tea.  Go figure!  Well, my overall opinion of the Higgins and Burke Black Chai is that it is a decent choice for anyone who wants a mild pleasant chai in a convenient tea-bag option, but I think I'm going to personally stick to my own homemade formula because I love making loose leaf tea blends!

review/summary: Taste like Spiced Tea but its pleasant.
review/text: I am a big lover of Chai tea and I understand how hard it is to reproduce the same results you see in Indian restaurants (another one that is hard to reproduce is Thai ice tea but that its another story).<br /><br />The package states 20 teabags/satches, but they really are just teabags. Each is individually wrapped in its own black wrapper for freshness and it makes a difference compare to Celestial Seasoning, as it is highly more aromatic when opening. However, you do end up with a lot of paper waste, which is ironic since they state in their package that they are "working for a responsible tea industry." C'est la vie. The carton is made with 100% recycled fibers though.<br /><br />Moving on, I have the habit of sometimes leaving my tea bag in my cup and forgetting I made tea in the first place until I realize it about 30 minutes later. This happened with my first cup and I was expecting a too strong bitter tea, but was pleasantly surprised that the tea tasted just fined over-steeped.<br /><br />Its hard to taste the various notes in this tea however. It mostly taste like cloves and it leaves a spicy aftertaste in your mouth for about 5 minutes after you have drank the tea.<br /><br />Cold milk eliminates some of the notes, so its better to have it with warm milk added.<br /><br />Does it taste like true chai tea? No. It tastes like spiced tea. But the price is reasonable, it taste fine when over-steeped, and you can have it in various ways (plain, with rock sugar, with hot milk, with condensed milk, cold milk with ice cubes). The various methods of enjoyment lets you find the one that is "just right" for you (for me a bit of sugar with a bit of hot milk).

review/text: I love Earl Grey tea and will pretty much try any brand at least once.  I got a box of the Higgins and Burke which was the first time ever trying this brand.  The fragrance is very strong and wonderful.  I was a bit surprised at how light the tea was was when steeping and thought maybe the flavor would be weak but I was pleasantly surprised when I took my first sip. It is not weak at all and the frangrance that hits your nose while drinking this just adds to the experience.  My wife was near me drinking her regular tea and she laughed because she could smell the fragrance of mine and it made her tea taste like Earl Grey.  I like this tea enough that I will be buying more of it and plan on trying other teas by this company.

review/summary: Pleasant
review/text: As a lifelong tea drinker I usually prefer loose tea but on occasion and for convenience sake I make my tea with tea bags. Here are my comments with regards to the Higgins & Burke Earl Grey tea bags:<br /><br />GENERAL:<br />1. These tea bags are individually wrapped to preserve their flavor - a plus in my opinion because too many tea bags produce rather bland tasting tea when they just come unprotected in large boxes.<br />2. When removing the wrapper the tea's scent is pleasant but not overwhelming, quite balanced.<br />3. It produces a good strong and flavorful cup of tea which is not bitter (I use 1 bag per cup and steep for 3 minutes).<br />4. According to the manufacturer this tea is produced under Ethical Tea Partnership guidelines.<br /><br />FLAVOR/SCENT<br />The flavor of this tea is a bit more on the citrus-y side and does not have as strong a bergamot note as is normally the case with Earl Grey. However, I did not mind this - the flavor was a good balance between a slightly more dominating orange flavor and a subtle but noticeable undertone of bergamot which gave a kind of earthy depth to the orange flavor.<br /><br />This is a pleasant tea and a slightly different interpretation - at least to my taste buds - of the usual Earl Grey which tends to be heavier on the bergamot. Recommend.

review/summary: EARL GREY...OUR OLD STAND-BY
review/text: My wife and I drink a tremendous amount of tea. I just went through our pantry a couple of hours ago and found no less that 23 different varieties stashed here and there. These varieties include quite a number of different brands. Not of the different blends we drink, the on constant is that fact that we continually return to Earl Grey; it could sort of the considered the corner stone of our tea drinking. Yes, we like variety, but for general everyday use, we are never without Earl Grey.<br /><br />Now of the various brands of this blend we use both Higgins' & Burke (That which is being reviewed here) and for years have also used Twinings. Which one we use depends greatly upon which is available at the local store at a given time and which one happens to be on sale during that time. To say that we are "frugal" would be a kindness. I can tell you that in our opinion and according to our taste, that either brand is quite satisfactory. Now I know that each individual's taste differs greatly so I can only comment on our personal likes and dislikes. That is one of the reasons I am quite happy with the fact that we now have a wonderfully large variety of not only blends, but also brands to choose from...it has not always so.<br /><br />This tea has a rather rich earthy taste and if you drink it straight some may detect just a hint of bitterness. Since we both use sugar in our tea (my wife also uses cream), that is not a problem with us. To be frank, most of the Earl Grey tea we have encountered, no matter the brand, has that hint of bitterness...that is the nature of this particular blend. We are perfectly satisfied with this Higgins' and Burke and will continue to use it.<br /><br />If I may though, I would like to offer a couple of suggestions. Use pure water. Water found in many city water systems simply is not adequate due to the various junk they add to it. If you find yourself with no other water source, then it is best to use purified bottle water. The second suggestion is to let it steep long enough. The directions for this particular tea suggest 3 to 5 minute timing. I personally have found that closer to 6 minutes is required to bring out the full flavor of almost all tea bag tea.<br /><br />Anyway, this is an excellent product. We have used it in the past and will most certainly use it in the future.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/text: I'm the first American born into my mother's UK family, so when I say that I was raised on tea, I am not exaggerating. The thing is, unlike coffee, I never have sugar with my tea - just a little bit of milk...drinking it this way makes me more aware of the subtle differences between tea brands and "flavors."<br /><br />Even with all the herbal teas available, Earl Grey will always be my favorite tea. The Higgins & Burke Earl Grey has just the right amount of bergamot. When I opened the individual foil-wrapped bag, the orange aroma hit me first...not overpowering, but rather inviting. This was a surprise because I've had some Earl Greys that had so much bergamot, I couldn't detect any other aromas.<br /><br />The taste is very smooth, and I've enjoyed every cup, but the real test was with my mother. She's always complained that many Earl Grey teas at our local store are so weak that she has to saok more than one bag per cup, but she loved Higgins & Burke!!

review/text: Earl Grey is not one of my favorite flavors of tea but I really liked this Higgins & Burke version. For point of reference, my favorite black tea is  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034KULLG">Bigelow Tea Constant Comment -- 40 Tea Bags</a>.  I compared the Higgins & Burke to the Twinings Earl Grey that I had on hand as part of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MP3TGO">Twinings Variety Pack of Four Flavors, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (20 Tea Bags)</a>.<br /><br />I brewed both cups of tea for 4 minutes, right in the middle of the 3-5 min range suggested on the H&B box. Compared to the Twinings, the H&B had a milder flavor that I personally much preferred.

review/summary: Light, delicate flavors
review/text: I received my sample of this tea free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review of the product.<br /><br />I brewed a cup this afternoon and sat on our front porch to enjoy it.  My first impression was of the fragrance of the black tea, followed by the bergamot scent.  And that's how it tasted too - more of black tea and less of bergamot.  I prefer a bolder bergamot flavor in my Earl Grey, but this was fresh and tasty too. For those who prefer a more subtle flavor, this would be a good tea for you.<br /><br />I liked that the box comes with a tear-out panel for easy dispensing.  Some of my boxed teas pop open and spill the bags out too easily.  I also liked that each individual bag was sealed for freshness.<br /><br />If, like me, you prefer a bold Earl Grey tea with lots of bergamot flavor, try Stash's Double Bergamot, available here on Amazon.

review/text: I love all sorts of teas. My friends know this, so when they travel they often bring me teas from overseas to try. Years ago, a friend gave me some English Breakfast Tea from her trip to Britain. What a full-bodied tea that was! When I had the opportunity to try this I jumped at it, assuming it would be identical. Although close, this is not quite as strong as the tea my friend bought in London.<br /><br />I do like the blend of Ceylon and Assam. It has that nice zing that cuts through a hearty breakfast, like the traditional English fry-up, but still tastes delicious with milk and sugar or honey. Be careful not to oversteep, though, or it can get quite bitter.

I didn't particularly notice any difference between it and the other brands that I have bought over the years. My wife, however, tasted it and mentioned that it did not have the bitter aftertaste that some of the cheaper bagged teas have. Since she doesn't drink tea with anything other than a light touch of lemon, I suspect her taste is much more refined than mine. I am a milk and sugar type tea drinker.<br /><br />To me this is a fine tea for those who drink tea and would be a good addition to the pantry. It is more costly than standard store brand teas, but if my wife is correct and there is no bitter aftertaste, then it would be a worthwhile investment.

review/summary: Nice Tea
review/text: If you like English Breakfast tea there is absolutely nothing wrong with this blend. It is aromatic and flavorful...though maybe a bit dry. But I like that somewhat astringent tongue cling.<br />Works for me in the morning when I want a change of pace from Sumatra coffee. Also good with a little milk if you like it that way.<br />The box acts as a dispenser and the bags are individually foil wrapped so if I saw this in a store I would buy it if I needed tea.

review/text: I have never been much of a hot tea drinker, but in fairness my only exposure to hot tea was Lipton or the green tea you get in Chinese restaurants and I liked neither. However, I like this tea a lot. I drink it with just a little half and half and I've been doing it every morning since I got this tea and I've since gone to the store and purchased more. I recommend this tea, it kind of makes me feel British.

review/summary: Delcate and mild. I would buy again
review/text: Black tea is my preferred tea flavor, and I always add a dash of sugar. I usually favor Tazo brand for all my teas. I would say Higgins & Burke is a good, very comparable flavor albeit a bit weaker and more mild. It surpassed some other brands because of that fact. Its mildness was easy drinking, especially when iced. I didnt feel the need to do two bags. If you like stronger black tea flavor, you would have to double up on this one which would make it not as good of a deal. Personally I like the light nature of this one, and would repurchase.

review/summary: Not bad, but I'll probably stick to my usual.
review/text: I love English Breakfast tea, and robust, full-flavored, almost malty without being bitter is how I'd describe the ideal blend.  Sadly, while the Higgins & Burke blend isn't the worst, I wouldn't say it's ideal.  Firstly, it's far from robust, almost weak when brewed according to the given directions of using one tea bag to brew a single cup of tea.  Secondly, it has a slight tannic/bitter aftertaste, not enough to be off-putting, but enough to be noticeable even for a tea novice.  That said, the Higgins & Burke blend has a slight floral/fruity flavor just at the edges, which is unusual for an English Breakfast blend; perhaps the weaker nature of the blend explains the ability to detect such a delicate flavor.<br /><br />Though the faint floral/fruity notes are an interesting flavor addition, they don't make up for the slightly bitter aftertaste, and while I can appreciate, even admire the ethically and ecologically friendly nature of the Higgins & Burke label, I'd like to have a tasty tea in addition to a clear conscience.  So I think I'll stick with my usual EB blend from Twinings and give a skip to the Higgins & Burke blend.

review/summary: Surprisingly good for bagged tea
review/text: I've been a tea fan for decades; I've written about tea and published stories about tea. I can tell you about second flush Darjeelings and "tippy golden" varieties. Like most self-styled "serious" tea drinkers, I've never been a fan of bagged tea, preferring to brew from "loose" leaves.<br /><br />Given all of that, I have to say that the Higgins & Burke was a very nice surprise. English Breakfast can mean a lot of things, but the leading element of the blend is usually Assam tea, which is known for its supposedly "malty" flavor. The H&B lists Assam as a main ingredient, which was good to see.<br /><br />The bags have a "flow through" design, which is also a good thing; this gives more surface area to the bags and allows for fuller brewing.<br /><br />I brewed up a pot--- not a cup. These tea bags really ought to be put in a pot. If you brew them in a cup, unless you cover it the water will cool too quickly during brewing, and besides, you'll have to reduce the brewing time to too short a length for best results.<br /><br />I was very pleased with the pots that I tried. The Assam flavor was rich and husky; the finished brew was smooth rather than rough; there was none of the staleness that sometimes comes with inferior bagged tea (which is sometimes made from sweepings and leavings). While I wouldn't have this for an after-dinner tea--- Assam is just too assertive--- it's a terrific breakfast tea, as the name implies.<br /><br />Of course, you can argue that if you're making a pot you might as well use loose-leaf tea and be done with it. That's a valid argument, but use of the bags certainly makes for faster clean-up and less effort overall. So besides being good, these tea bags do have a definite role.<br /><br />I'm pleased to be able to recommend this product. It has made me rethink the idea of bagged tea.

review/summary: A Great English Breakfast Tea
review/text: First let me disclose that I am not a tea connoisseur with an ideal English Breakfast tea in mind to which to compare this Higgins & Burke tea.  That said, I have tried quite a few different English Breakfast teas over the years and like this one as well as any other.  It seems this tea is not strong enough for many other reviewers, but this being a matter of personal taste, this tea is plenty strong enough for me.  I find it to be stout and crisp, just what I expect from a good English Breakfast tea.  I know this might appall some of the tea purists out there, but I vary wildly in how long I steep my teas.  One morning it might be 2 minutes, another morning it might be 10 or 15 minutes.  I tend to get distracted around the house.  I've occasionally forgotten about the tea only to rediscover it a half an hour later, at which point I warm it in the microwave and drink it anyway.  I know - it's so tragic and wrong where tea is concerned.  This morning was a 10-minute-steep with this tea, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the tea, while quite strong, was just fine and had not developed a bitter or sharp edge. It still made a wonderful sipping tea and dunking companion for my homemade biscotti. I would be quite happy to purchase and enjoy this tea again.

review/summary: Wow
review/text: I am a big fan of English Breakfast teas and I have to say that I really like this tea. I can't say that I am too familiar with the Higgins & Burke brand, but I am impressed with the quality of their offering. It had a nice, mild flavor, but didn't tase "weak" like some mild teas do. Some people don't like mild tea, I am a fan of it in the mornings, or as a relaxing cup in the evening, so if you like very strong flavors, then I wouldn't recommend this (unless you want to use two bags per cup). It also has a bit of a bitter aftertaste, which I think is characteristic of English Breakfast teas, but it's not overpowering or terrible. My wife likes her tea a bit sweeter and a little stronger than I do, but she did like this when she tried it plain (and liked it more when she added a bit of sweetener!). I would definitely recommend this tea ot any English Breakfast or black tea fan.<br /><br />It was also nice to see that this brand is part of the Ethical Tea Partnership.

review/summary: Incredibly Smooth Flavorful English Breatkfast Tea
review/text: I LOVE tea. On my recent 9 month tour of schools in my performing incarnation I had several boxes of teas of all kinds: standard and flavored. Part of this stems from my having lived in India for two years where I became almost addicted to tea. I may skip breakfast, but each morning it is tea. English Breakfast tea is not as easy to buy as you'd think. I find that many teas are too sharp or they make them a bit too weak. Or they are not as flavorful as a GOOD English breakfast tea. THE GREAT NEWS is that Higgins & Burk English Breakfast Tea is incredibly smooth, yet not watered down, and wonderfully flavorful. I decided to put this tea to several tests. First, I let the bag seep in a VERY big tea cup I use that I bought on amazon (my favorite...it's thick glass). I always add some sugar. This was strong yet smooth and wonderful. Then I added soy milk the next morning. SUPERB. Then I added milk the next morning: also SUPERB. This is one brand I had never tired before and I've tried all kinds. And I will say it: it is now my favorite brand of English Breakfast tea. It passed all my tests.

review/text: I am a huge tea drinker and enjoy having a good chai in my tea stash. Unfortunately, this tea is a very average chai tea. This is not a bad product. The tea had good flavor and tastes like chai tea should. There is, however, nothing extraordinary or unique about it. It tastes very much like other chai teas I've had (from a tea bag). I don't know that I would recognize or pick this brand of tea over any other boxed chai tea bags. If you need a good staple chai tea to have around, this one is okay. Just don't expect anything special from it.

review/summary: Odd 'floral' taste?
review/text: I drink several cups of black tea every day, often Twinings or Stash English or Irish Breakfast tea, or Tazo's Awake, but sometimes I pick up other English Breakfast teas to try and enjoy.  But this Higgins & Burke... another reviewer said it had an almost soapy taste and I agree.  When I first opened the tea bags I noticed this floral/soapy scent and it ended up tasting this way too, even after adding milk and a little sugar.  It was hard for me to get past that floral taste, especially since it was followed a weird aftertaste, maybe bitter.  Regarding the aftertaste, perhaps the water I use is too hot for this tea or perhaps I brew it a few minutes too long, but I prefer my tea to not be so finicky if this is the case.  I'm not a connoisseur, I never use loose leaf tea, and I use regular tap water... I'm just an everyday tea drinker.  And I prefer that my English Breakfast tea not have floral/soapy notes to it.

When left to cool it gave a bit of a tang, but not too much to be unpleasant. It is a very comfortable tea and  perfect for any time of day and with any accompaniment. I will continue to get this drink both this and the Yorkshire Gold, just to keep things fresh, and will purchase more when this box gets close to running out.

review/text: When I sample a tea for the first time, I do so black--no sugar, milk, or other additives. I also brew according to directions given on the package in order to set a base line for taste. This English Breakfast had a lovely rich aroma, but was actually much milder than I expected; not unpleasant, nor left an unpleasant aftertaste.<br /><br />Adding sugar didn't dimish the flavour, but adding a splash of milk, unfortunately, did. It wasn't egregious and after some experimentation I found the perfect balance of milk and sugar, but this still isn't one of my favourite sachet English Breakfast blends. That honour remains with Stash and Twinings. But I would have no problem recommending it to folks who might prefer a lighter, but not overly so, blend of black tea.

review/summary: Good Tea-In-A-Bag, Tea
review/text: I am not a tea snob.  I enjoy a "snobby" cup of tea, well made in a tea shop but at home, I like the convenience of a tea bag.  Twinings brand English Breakfast is one of my favorite blends so that is my comparison tea.<br /><br />I made this tea with 6 oz. (3/4 Cup) of boiling water poured over the tea bag.  If you use more than 6 oz., your tea will be weak; these premeasured bags are not meant to steep a big US mug of water. If you are using a big mug, use 2 tea bags. I steep for 3 minutes so that the tea doesn't become "stewed"; that funky, bitter taste.  You should use the water immediately after reaching the boiling point because oxygen will evaporate the longer the water boils & your tea will taste flat.<br /><br />The Higgins & Burke is a nice cup of tea.  It has a strong, not bitter flavor with a little maltiness & a hint of smoke.  I think the Twinings is a little more refined, more malty & no smoke.  I like my English Breakfast tea with just a splash of cream; no sugar.<br /><br />The Higgins & Burke is a blend of Assam & Ceylon teas.  The Twinings is a blend of Assam & Kenyan.  If you like a bit more brash black tea, you may like the Higgins & Burke.

review/summary: good solid bag tea
review/text: I didn't have great luck with my last Higgins and Burke tea--the Earl Grey, finding its Bergamot overly emphasized. I'm happy to say the English Breakfast was much more to my taste. It has the standard pros of this brand--the packaging is made from recycled materials and the company purchases its tea under the Ethical Tea Standards.  The tea itself is a nice tea, especially for bag tea (I almost always use loose leaf).  It has a nice scent and the flavor had a distinct assam taste to it, which I quite liked. It distinguished itself from a lot of bland similar-tasting English Breakfast bag teas.  It had a good full but not overpowering flavor with no bitterness at all.  I've seen some reviewers have found it overly mild, but I didn't have that problem and I like my tea strong and with nothing added.  It also holds up to a second washing decently, but not a third (no surprise there, few teas do). As mentioned, I don't normally drink bag tea and while I keep some boxes in the cupboard for the times I need to just throw a bag in, my choices are almost always Lapsong Souchong and Earl Grey. But I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this one and might just add it to the rotation.  Recommended, especially for those who like assam.

review/text: I just recently started drinking tea as a substitute for coffee in the morning and soda in the afternoon. I have fallen in love with Red Rose tea for the afternoon but I find it is a bit light for mornings. I have tried a couple of the breakfast teas in the grocery store with mixed result.<br /><br />When I saw this tea up for review on the Amazon Vine, I figured what the heck, let's try it. The first thing I noticed is that each tea bag is wrapped in foil packets. They were also easy to tear open without tearing up the tea bag. I noticed that there was a nice smell to the tea.<br /><br />I brewed up a quick iced tea, one cup of hot water and two tea bags. Then I pour that over ice and add a little sugar. I noticed that the flavor is a little stronger than Red Rose tea, which is what I'm looking for in a breakfast tea. But in the end, it is still a mild flavor without the bitter taste I tend to find with other breakfast teas.<br /><br />This is a great, mild breakfast tea for those that like tea without the strong bitter taste.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

review/summary: Smells phenomenal, and with a little milk it tastes great
review/text: Usually sticking with brands like Stash, Tazo, or Celestial Seasonings, this was my first outing with Higgins & Burke. The tea's packaging talks about an "intoxicating fragrance," which normally would just be nonsense to help sell a product, but in this case the box blurb is correct. This tea does smell phenomenal - both in the packet and brewed.<br /><br />But how does it taste?  Frankly on its own the taste is a little mediocre and just slightly on the bitter side. There are definitely teas out there much more pleasing to the palette straight out of the box, but throw in a splash of milk (and maybe a little sugar) and you've got something well worth drinking here that's much more cost effective than getting a chai out at the coffee shop.  For something a little different from the standard black or herbal teas, I recommend giving this one a try.

Brewed hot at the temperature suited for black teas, it was bitter. Prepared iced, it was not, but it lacked the qualities that make iced teas so enjoyable--the perfumed leaves and mellow taste, and in the case of really great teas, a filling sensation and slight sweetness without the need for sugar or honey. Leaf size was quite small, so again, this is not the highest quality, though the packaging is the only good part--individually sealed envelopes. I would not buy this product again. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.

review/summary: Full-bodied and flavorful
review/text: Higgins & Burke is a name in tea that had escaped me until now, but I'm glad I found it. There are teas out there that I won't return to, but this tea has what's required: body, aroma, and flavor. I waited for the first reasonably cool morning to really appreciate it, and I'm just finishing my first cup. It won't be the only one today, now that I've had it. This is a take-it-out-on-the-front-step-and-watch-the-world-go-by sort of tea. A day-off, good-music-on-the-radio tea. I guess you could say I like it.

review/summary: Excellent Tea with Delightful Ethical Aftertaste
review/text: This is fine tea. English Breakfast Tea is a bit of a commodity, and an increasingly familiar one. This variation is quite good, not as piquant as some alternatives--and not leaving the rather bitter aftertaste one sometimes finds in combination. If you tend toward a milder tea, this one may well please you.<br /><br />The company that produces this product is part of the Ethical Tea Partnership. For those interested, I would suggest visiting ethicalteapartnership dot org. The list of participating companies includes giants such as Tetley and Twinings, and is missing some other familiar names.<br /><br />Something more to think about, something else in favor of this product.<br /><br />My overall suggestion: find a tea you like, and find one that is from a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership. There's no one rule for taste--but there are universal expectations of ethics, realizable ideals.<br /><br />This tea will meet those criteria for many people.

review/summary: Smooth, substantial, with chewy flavor!
review/text: I love English Breakfast tea, and this was not a disappointment. With some cream and sweetener, this made the perfect cup to get me going in the morning. Normally I'll make a coffee drink (with a lot of Torani sugar free syrup and real cream) but this tea just hits the spot some mornings.<br /><br />It has that full bodied chewiness about it that makes a good English Breakfast tea. It's not thin or flat tasting at all. Love it and would purchase.

review/summary: Not the Best I've Tried
review/text: This is the first time I've tried Higgins & Burke Teas.  I really enjoy Bigelow English Breakfast Tea so I thought I might like this as well.  It is NOT the same, or really even similar, but it is a good tea, in my opinion.  I confess, I drink coffee almost daily and tea, only occasionally.<br /><br />It's not too strong for me, as I don't care for really strong drinks, but is flavorful.  I use a bit of sugar in my tea, and sometimes cream if it's stronger and depending on the variety.  This tasted good with just the sugar.  I enjoyed this the few times I've tried it and still have quite a few bags left.  I will update if I have anything to add.  I do like the individual packs that this comes in as it is kept fresher longer.<br /><br />If Bigelow EBT and this were side by side, I'd pick the Bigelow, but of course that's personal preference.  It's a good tea and an worthwhile and interesting change from the usual.

review/text: This is a surprising good quality tea from the Canadian company, Higgins and Burke. In years past, I have had English breakfast tea that has been bitter and overly acidic. This English Breakfast is smooth, without any bitter after taste.<br /><br />It has a pleasant, almost floral aroma as well.<br /><br />It can also be served chilled, with good taste, as well.<br /><br />This tea is recommended highly for general home use.

review/summary: Slight disappointment
review/text: I love Chai tea!  So I jumped on the Higgins and Burke Chai Black Tea.  I noticed when I opened the carton that there was a slight scent of spices.<br />When brewing the black tea, again it was a slight smell.<br />The taste was slight in spices, more Cinnamon then anything else.  I found it a little watery using one tea bag, so I made another cup of tea using 2 tea bags, still even with 2 tea bags, the flavor lacked a nice taste.<br />I would say this tea needs to be re blended as I was disappointed ion this offering from Higgins and Burke.

review/text: Higgins & Burke Gourmet Tea was established by an old and trusted Canadian coffee and tea manufacturer - Mother Parkers. Higgins & Burke's English BreakFast Black Tea is a delicious tea, with a wonderfully robust taste that makes it good in the morning or throughout the day. It's delicious hot with lemon and milk, or iced with lemon and sugar.<br /><br />It's a very good all-round tea that is good iced or hot, and it goes good with just about any food.

review/summary: Citrus notes of Bergamot and lemon in a soothing black tea
review/text: This premium black tea is made with natural oil of Bergamot and natural lemon flavor to make a soothing cup to relax the senses. The black tea strength comes through and the finishing notes of citrus are slightly tart. I added a bit of sugar to mine to smooth out the taste.  I love the 100% recycled packaging and it is easy to select one tea bag at a time as they are individually sealed and retain their freshness. There are also NO staples to deal with as the string is stitched to the tag. Higgins and Burke teas are quality through and through and I would highly recommend them as I have tried several flavors and have not been disappointed.

review/summary: Good tasting breakfast tea
review/text: I like to drink my tea hot and with a splash of milk.  I also prefer 'plain old' black teas to anything fancy or flavored.  I found Higgins & Burke to suit my taste, although it's not a very strong tea when compared to something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001LQKBQ">Pg Tips 80 Ct Tea Bags</a>, even when I increase the steep time to 7 minutes.<br /><br />Each teabag is individually wrapped in a 'stay fresh' foil sachet.  The tea blend is Assam and Ceylon black tea, with 180mg of Polyphenols per serving (8oz water).  Overall, I found Higgins & Burke to be a good cup of breakfast tea, with a medium strength taste.

review/summary: Weird Aftertaste
review/text: I am a tea fan. I tried this tea both hot and cold. It is much better hot than cold. The tea itself is just your average black tea. Nothing special. It does seem to have an odd aftertaste. I like that the tea bags are individually wrapped and they open without tearing the tea bag, so that is a plus. But as far as tea goes, this tea is like other mediocre black teas I've had. Nothing special.

review/text: In a word how would I describe a sip of Higgins & Burke Chai Black Tea - "mellow."  It is the kind of tea you might have after a fine dinner with guests and sitting around the fire for light conversation.  I expected it to be overpowering in flavors since it has nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon and other spices in there but it wasn't.  It is a pleasant experience - a mellow experience.  I would consider buying it as it is a unique product.

review/summary: Okay
review/text: I felt the need to do this review when I noticed Amazon doesn't tell you this is SUGAR FREE candy. I actually bought a bag of this candy while leaving Japan at the airport in Nagoya. I saw them and thought, 'omg those look delicious green tea/green tea latter candy, yes please!' I was so happy to see maccha (green tea) that I wasn't much paying attention. So of course, when I put the first piece in my mouth, I immediately thought, 'okay, this tastes really gross, what in the world...?' I then noticed that not only was it green tea candy, it said 'non-shugaa' (non-sugar) at the top. I took off a star because I personally found them very gross buuuut I'd imagine if you're used to/enjoy sugar free candies, they'd probably be quite good. I was just disheartened that I would not be enjoying happy green tea candy on my ridiculously long return flight.<br /><br />So yes, important point: THIS CANDY IS SUGAR FREE!

review/summary: Excellent quality mole poblano
review/text: This is excellent quality mole poblana sauce. Mexican mothers don't make it from scratch, they buy these little jars that incidentally are designed to be used as juice glasses--they aren't threaded. You can use a bottle opener to break the seal, otherwise it can be a little difficult to remove the lid.<br /><br />I don't add extra sugar or salt as suggested, only chicken broth, although I do add dried chipotle to make it a little spicier. Makes about four cups of thick sauce.<br /><br />It's great on chicken but also wonderful as a sauce for anything in a corn or flour tortilla, any kind of meat, on rice as you would use gravy, as a sandwich spread, or even to eat with tortilla chips or cornbread.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Sesame seed, vegetable oil (cottonseed and/or sunflower, and/or soybean oil), toasted bread (wheat flour, vegetable shortening (soybean, cottonseed and/or safflower oil), sugar cane syrup, salt, leavening agents (sodium bicarbonate, ammonium bicarbonate and soy lecithin), sugar, dried red peppers, iodized salt, cocoa, caramel color, spices, natural flavoring, FD&C red no. 40, FD&C. red no. 40 lake.<br /><br />Nutrition:<br />Serving size 2 tbsp (28g), about 8 servings per container<br />cal. 150<br />fat cal. 100<br />total fat 11g<br />sat. fat 2g<br />trans fat 0g<br />cholesterol 0mg<br />sodium 270mg<br />total carb 12g<br />fiber 1g<br />sugars 4g<br />protein 3g<br />vitamin A 4% DV<br />calcium 8% DV<br />iron 8% DV<br />(based on 2,000 cal diet)

review/summary: not as good as Dona Maria
review/text: I ordered this mole sauce, rather than picking up a jar of Dona Maria at the local store, because I had read several reviews which claimed it was much better.  I disagree.  I found the Rogelio Bueno mole to be much sweeter, with more cinnamon; with less complexity and less chocolate and smoky flavors than the Dona Maria.  My husband compared the Rogelio Bueno mole to spicy gingerbread.  Everyone in my house strongly preferred the Dona Maria. I know mole varies greatly, but the Rogelio Bueno mole did not remind me of the mole I've had in Mexico.  I will not be buying it again.

The treats are low in fat, which is importamt for any dog, but especially important for yorkies, which are prone to stomach problems that can progress to pancreatitis.  The pups love these treats, and the mint flavor gives puppy breath a nice scent, or as nice as a dog can have.  The price is pretty much standardized.  I rarely ever see a bargain, and this purchase was no exception.  Shipping was prompt - no complaints.

review/summary: Puppy Crack Cocaine!
review/text: Ok, ok, I apologize for the title. It can be irreverent and insensitive to some so again, my apologies.  But I have to tell you my two French Bulldogs have been getting these as treats for NINE years - first for training, then for being good, now right after they both get their daily eye & arthritic medication in morning and they are totally, completely hooked on them. We sit on the kitchen floor and go through our daily morning medical ritual. Then reward time. They see their favorite canister in the whole world come out (which I keep in the refrig, they seem to like it a little better chilled, hey they're French, what do I know!).  Anyway, their big beautiful brown eyes seem to double in size, glaze over in a memorized trance, thoroughly fixated and totally focused like a beam of hot white light on what I irreverently now say to them, "ok, time for your puppy crack cocaine". You'd think after 9 years it would lessen a little but it hasn't one bit.  They're pyscho for this stuff and for Talk to Me Pup-RRR-Mint Sticks more then any other treats I've ever given them in 9 years.  And believe me, I spoil my Frenchies like no one else lol and rotate treats constantly, every few days, so they are never bored. I should be so well treated. haha  But the two little Talk to Me Treats they each get after their medicine every morning remain far and away my druggie doggies favorites. lol  Like I said, I'm sorry for being irreverent - but both my Frenchies' reaction to this all is adorable. Maybe urs will be too.  And Im glad that it's healthy for them.  They're my Frenchies, I love 'em to death and love making them happy.
