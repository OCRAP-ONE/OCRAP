review/summary: Brownie style soft cookie
review/text: Started ordering these yummy, rich chocolate cookies a few months ago.As most chocolate lovers know,it's not worth it to eat poor quality chocolate. These are filled with dark chocolate bits and are soft and creamy in the mouth.Actually they are so good that eating "just one" is truly satisfying.

review/summary: PEPPERIDGE FARM SOFT BAKED SANTA CRUZ OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIE(PACK OF 4)
review/text: Another delicious selection in the Pepperidge Farm family of Cookies called Santa Cruz Oatmeal Raisin. I picked up my order for a great bargain through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for only $7.49!!! When you consider that these normally cost you listed on bag @ $3.49/per, and generally never go on sale at the supermarket/grocery store unlike the Milano Brand line of cookies by Pepperidge Farm the price was right to quote the famous game show still on T.V. today. Get yours today and ENJOY!!!

review/summary: PEPPERIDGE FARM COOKIES, Mmmmmmmm
review/text: What can be said negative about Pepperidge Farm Cookies.....ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! These soft baked, milk chocolate variety from Pepperidge Farm comes with 8 deliciously decadent cookies per package with a total of 5 packages per order and is mouth watering for any cookie or chocolate lover period! To boot, since this type of variety of Pepperidge Farm Cookies NEVER goes on sale at the supermarket or grocery store(at least where I live) unlike Milano and their Goldfish Brands, it would cost you $3.49 per bag X5, for a total of $16.95. Except I pick these up all the time through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for anywhere between my most recent purchase for 5 bags @ $11.04-$11.82 in the past, so you can't go wrong! If the Warehouse Deals(when available) or straight Amazon have a listing available at a higher price then mentioned in this review, then BE PATIENT and rest assure that the price will come down and you'll snag a great bargain like I do all the time on a regular basis. Having some now, Mmmmm!

review/summary: BROKEN COOKIES, BAD PACKAGING
review/text: These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, "Don't call here anymore."

review/text: I love Pepperidge farm Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies. They make the perfect snack. While other cookies are hard and dry with the texture of sawdust these cookies taste great, and are soft like they've just come out of the oven.<br /><br />Downsides? Each cookie is 130 calories which is a lot for such a small cookie. Also these contain interesterified fats/oils which are chemically altered oils. Not really great for humans to consume.<br /><br />The result? I think I'll bake my own... Without the chemicals. It would probably be safer. 5 star taste. 2 star ingredients. Rating, Average.

review/summary: Cookie Monster
review/text: These are great cookies - a treat when a treat is what is needed. Can't eat just one. Unless it is the one bag of them. I don't like crunchy cookies in general but these are the exception. The are not completely crunchy - they have a bit of a shortbread texture to them to soften that crunch a bit. Lovely chocolate - and that is very important to me. When I make homemade chocolate chip cookies (that my Dad says are the best of everyones) I use only the best chocolate chips (Ghirardelli or Scharffen Berger. These are a great substitute when I don't feel like baking!!

review/summary: Fabulous cookies..poor packaging
review/text: All the reviews sounded so yummy...and they were right.  I absolutely love these cookies<br />BUT....they've got to solve their packaging problem.  I've opened two canisters so far and have a grand total of 2 unbroken cookies in one canister and 3 whole cookies and 2 more half cookies in the other.  The rest is tiny, tiny crumbs.  It should make good pressed pie crust.  It really is so yummy and I do have two more canisters to open, but I'm so disappointed that they are too broken up to serve to guests.  ADDENDUM...just opened another canister and these cookies are fine...and very delicious.

review/summary: Chocolates might be great; shipping was less so; customer service is great
review/text: While it was shipped to me insulated in styrofoam, no cold packs were included in the shipment--which was heading to Atlanta in early September (the American South in the summer).  I assumed that since I was paying over $20 for shipping--the absolute fastest time, greater care would be taken to ensure that the product arrived intact.  Unfortunately, the chocolates I received were largely melted.  I do not recommend the purchase of this item to be shipped to any region experiencing temperatures above 78 degrees.<br /><br />UPDATE: Received an e-mail, which read (in part) as follows: First, my apologies for not answering you earlier... I didn't notice there was a melting issue with your order till late last week while addressing a small more recent delivery problem.  Anyway, as you have noticed with your order, melting can and does happen in transit, but luckily only with an insignificant number of our packages as we only experience about two dozen or three dozen a year out of well over 15,000 packages. Insignificant when view in percentage terms, but still most infuriating when this happens.<br /><br />The e-mail went on to note that they are replacing my order.  I am stunned--I have had a melting issue before with a different chocolate company (remember, I live in Atlanta, Georgia, where summer temperatures are a bear), and I received nothing in the way of satisfaction.  I figured it would be the same and didn't even bother to directly contact the company (a mistake on my part).  I am *very* pleased with this level of service.

review/summary: Perfectly Delicious
review/text: If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />The "I Love You" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's R�verie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

I've had many different types of chocolate from Belgium and can guarantee - Leonidas is the "Mercedes-Benz" of chocolatiers.  The general assortment is an outstanding sampling of ivory, milk and dark chocolate.  If you love dark chocolate then go for the dark chocolate assortment.  You will not regret it.  Also forget Godiva - it's medium grade quality.

review/text: The Leonidas chocolates being peddled in the USA bear little/no resemblance to those available in Europe. After enjoying Leonidas in Germany (Aachen and Munich) for many years I placed an order here in New York State. What I received was (a) crudely presented boxes of (b) thick, hard-shelled (c) anonymous flavoured cream centres. With the exception of the coffee creams (which were more or less as I remember them from Europe) the rest of the box seemed to consist of two undefinable centres. Extremely disappointed with this order. The Godiva selection my mother received for Christmas was FAR superior in every respect -- packaging, presentation, appearance, texture, taste. I won't buy Leonidas in the USA again.

The chocolates themselves melt in your mouth and their coffee-hazlenut pralines are to die for! The hazlenut is just that-pure, unadulterated nuts-that said, some people might expect ferrero rocher like taste-its very different, and for some people, even distasteful. But I love it! There are around three layers in the box, and each layer has around seven pieces. Pretty good value actually, and makes an excellent gift!

And I give the company 6 stars for customer service.

review/summary: Good but not THAT good
review/text: After sending these chocolates as Christmas presents in the last two years, I have decided to sample them myself.<br /><br />If one includes shipping, these chocolates costs around $1.50 per piece. That is not the highest chocolate price but still a premium price.<br /><br />As others have noted, the packaging is very well done. The box itself is wrapped in a stryofoam box. The ribbons add a nice touch to the presentation.<br /><br />The taste of these chocolates, however, is merely good. As a comparison, I think the Dove chocolates one can get at a grocery store is about 80% as good at about 1/5 the price.<br /><br />I think Godiva chocolates are about as good.<br /><br />But no one gets credit and thanks for sending Godiva (non-box kind) or Dove chocolates for Christmas and they certainly don't come in a nice box with a ribbon and a Belgian chocolate brand.<br /><br />I have tasted better chocolates.<br /><br />If you want the most premium tasting chocolates possible, then these will somewhat disappoint. Nonetheless, no one will dislike these chocolates especially when given as a Christmas present.

review/summary: Very good, but not fantastic
review/text: O,K. Leonidas is one of the best Belgian chocolate makers. Alas the "pralines" they make in Belgium are not for export (too much whipped cream and perishable ingredients). What they sell in America is the not so perishable stuff (hence the nuts and chocolate cream). That may be why so many reviewers evoke Nutella. I sent a box to my brother who spent time in Belgium as a teenager. He was very happy, but pointed out that there is more to Leonidas: white marzipan with a wanut on top, strawberry marzipan and, of course the pistacchio whipped cream, etc..Leonidas remains a good option if you like chocoalte.<br />Somehow my previous review was taken off. Hope this one stays.

review/text: I purchased the Leonidas Chocolates from Amazon about a month ago.  My wife and I love chocolate. After reading the raving reviews I felt this would be a great gift.  The shipping was very quick, so no complaints there.  The chocolate had a nice flavor, but we were not impressed with the fillings. If we had to choose, the hazelnut was the best in the box, followed by a white chocolate that was good.  For the price, you can find better chocolate elsewhere.

review/summary: Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment
review/text: I ordered a Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment. I had to pick up the box at a local UPS outlet one day after the first attempted delivery.  The weather here is mild, not very hot or very cold.  When I opened the box and sampled the chocolates I immediately noticed a stale and unpalatable taste.  I recognized this taste from what occurs when chocolate is frozen or exposed to refrigerated air.  I responded to an email from Amazon asking for a review of my purchase.  I recounted my experience.  I received an email from Leonidas claiming that to their knowledge the product was not sent damaged.  Leonidas stated they would replace my order.  They have not.  I emailed Leonidas again asking about their intentions to replace my order.  I have received no reply.  Amazon attached a statement to the email I received from Leonidas disavowing any responsibility for Leonidas' product or the delivery of it.  So, here is my response: I will make no more purchases of food stuffs from Leonidas until a refund or replacement is forth coming.  I understand Amazon's position, but as a consumer of many items purchased via the Internet, I think that Amazon needs to review their policy regarding 3rd party vendors.  This is the first time any product I have purchase from Amazon had a problem.  I am somewhat shocked that their attitude towards my problem is: you're own your own.

So, I ordered it for the family (I just sampled..).  The packaging is really nice.. it would make a great gift.  As for the chocolate itself, well... it is better than most store brands, but not as good as Godiva.  I would rather pay a little more for better quality, or pay a lot less for a bar of Cadbury.

Beautiful packaging and great taste. I would recommend these for sure but be aware of the shipping time and expect them faster than 3-5 business days.

review/text: I bought one box after reading the nice rating/reviews. My hubby gave it a so-so rating. I tasted it, and was ultimately disappointed. I felt that I had to write a review to tell others. The chocolate is simply okay, comparable to $10/lb chocolate I buy at local produce. But the fillings were horrible (most of them). Given it is $36/lb + $18 for shipping, I am sure I will never ever buy another one.

So the main difference is this ramen is MILD and not Spicy like the Nong Shim counterpart. The broth is pretty tasty and not overbearing. The noodles are like the smaller Sapporo Ramen and not the large korean noodles that nong shim uses. There is little pieces of kimchi but its really not much to get the full kimchi taste. Hope you enjoy this ramen to!

review/summary: Don't be afraid! The spice is a-nice
review/text: This is a good product, I'll buy it again, no question. But if you are a sincere chili head, and you better be if you're buying it, it's not as hot as you'd think. Because my temperament has adapted to intense levels of heat, spices/sauces that claim to be beyond insane tend to NOT be as hot as advertised. For serious - SERIOUS - chili heads, on a scale of 1-10, this is about a 7. The salt is really just that - salt. The balance in one bite is about 80 percent salt, 20 percent heat, but that ratio keeps it from being a scorching heat. That being said, I've figured it out enough to know what it's going to taste great on (spaghetti!), what it's going to add nice heat to (wings, of course), and where I can do without it. All in all, a good product that I'll keep regularly stocked in my pantry.

I ordered 2 oz (almost gone), and now I just ordered a pound of it to keep me for a while.  Good job guys!  How you can successfully infuse ghost pepper extract into sea salt is amazing to me!

(250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids. To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is.

review/text: Sometimes you just have to throw caution to the wind and enjoy life a bit. I don't think anyone in their right minds would recommend this product as the beginning and end of all meals that should be fed to children on a daily bases. (Unfortunately, I see this happening a lot). This certainly is NOT a health food.<br />But that being said, kids love this stuff and I do too...not that I can be called an "adult" in the normal sense. This is not the Mac and Cheese your old granny use to cook for you; no, it is a prepackaged quite meal or part of a meal. It can be classified as a comfort food by many, and that is indeed what it is.<br /><br />It is quick to prepare, makes a great side dish, and the flavor is wonderful...although I will admit that like good Scotch, it is an acquired taste. It is cheap and makes a wonderful after school snack.<br /><br />I note that one reviewer here has given this product on star. Let it be noted that this guy is shilling for his own dreadful little book and that the review he wrote is pretty bogus and should not be taken seriously.<br /><br />I have sisters and bothers with children. I am the single sister...translate that to free baby sitter. My siblings are uptight health freaks and stuff their little ones with "health" food...translate that to boring, boring, boring. I am not saying this is bad...far from it, but these little guys and girls need a bit of a treat now and then. After I pick them up from school or keep them for the weekend (many, many weekends I tell you), I indulge them....and myself, I must admit. I do it with really unhealthy but tasty foods. When they leave and return to their mundane little diets, I return to mine, but when we are together...let the good times roll.<br /><br />This is a good product. I keep it stashed all the time. I use it when ever I can. I, and the kids, enjoy every bite.

review/summary: A healthier version of a classic favorite
review/text: My kids love Kraft Macaroni & Cheese.  A few years back I decided to stop buying most packaged products to avoid ingredients that I did not want to feed my family.  I started buying organic whenever possible.  There are other organic mac & cheese products on the market, but they all were rejected by my kids.  We were very excited to find this product!  Unfortunately, it is very hard to find in my local markets.  Amazon to the rescue with the ability to purchase a case!  Happy kids, happy mom!

review/summary: Loving the organic...
review/text: The organic Macaroni and Cheese from Kraft makes fast dinners a snap.  I have a 4- and 7-year-old and they love it!  I will usually prepare it with plain non-fat Greek yogurt, which adds protein and calcium, and the kids love it more.  They even ask for it to be prepared "with the yogurt!"  Whatever is left-over, they have no problems eating it in their school lunches the next day.  I am happy to be giving them an all-time favorite (that even we loved as kids) in an organic fashion...way to go Kraft for doing that for us and the planet.

review/summary: Different but good. Son loves it.
review/text: The color and taste are slightly different in Kraft's organic Mac & Cheese compared to their classic version.  It is slightly lighter and the cheese is missing that "fakish" artificial cheese taste that so many of us love.  (It tastes more like real cheese.)  But it's not a drastic taste difference like some of the organic Mac&Cheese have.<br /><br />Once I got over the difference, however, I found I actually prefer the flavor of the organic. My 5yo son is thrilled with it.<br /><br />We'll be buying our 3rd 12 pack soon.

review/summary: My kids' favorite mac n cheese
review/text: We've tried several brands of organic macaroni and cheese and this is, by far, my kids' favorite one.  It tastes almost identical to Kraft Macaroni and Cheese (original), but doesn't have that unnatural bright orange glow.  My only complaint is that the cheese sauce is a little harder to get the lumps to smooth out than the original, but once you add the noodles in and stir it well, they pretty much smooth out.  And, I'm pretty sure the original is so smooth due to some added chemical, which I'm more than happy to do without, even with the sacrifice of a slightly lumpier sauce.  Overall - great product and Amazon's case price is the best I've found anywhere.

review/text: While preparing I thought  "wow no more electric orange color. Cool" yet i quickly found that this was not a good thing.This tastes and looks nothing like the original Kraft macaroni and cheese. It's pale and simply tastes odd not to mention the weirdly patronizing message on the actual box. "look how cool you are holding this organic box. People envy you for being so smart. You're a real trend setter". I didn't notice the crap on the box until I got it home and had started preparing it.  I bought this because for whatever reason my market didn't have the regular. If this disgusting sludge makes me a trendsetter I fear what would not make me a trendsetter. Tastes terrible and comes in packaging that insults my intelligence. I may have to quit regular Kraft in protest of this insulting abomination. I know it may sound like I'm taking this too seriously, but eat a bowl of this crap while reading the horrible patronizing box and then form your opinion.

review/summary: 5 Star Organic value for a classic side dish
review/text: The move to going organic needs to be a smooth transition, especially when you are cooking for more than one person.  Breaking the barrier of "ewe organic, I don't know..." can be easier if you don't go wild on the switch to organic. That being said, this Kraft Organic Macaroni & Cheese is a good start. Tastes just like the real thing.  If you don't believe me, just slap down a buck at you local grocery store and just give it a shot. You wont find it on sale with a coupon (yet) but it will help you and your family start making moves toward replacing some of your food with Organic.<br /><br />What I shoot for is less of the extra food additives with the bonus of organic farming of wheat and milk. It still comes in a cardboard box and a semi-foil cheese bag of flavor, but hey you got to start somewhere. Just recycle the box and enjoy one of your favorite side dishes.  Once you try the first box, you'll know that you will have no problems finishing off the case sold here.<br /><br />Oh, just an FYI. I found out on my own (by opening the box and comparing the semi-foil cheese bags of flavor) that the Organic Back to Nature Mac&Cheese has the exact same bag of cheese. Right down to the same serial number.  I would bet the pasta is the same too.

review/summary: Healthy? Don't kid yourself.
review/text: Sorry, but this product is NOT HEALTHY. The word "organic" only means that the ingredients were grown with out certain chemicals, such as pesticides and hormones. So if you must eat Kraft mac-n-cheese, this is a better choice than regular. But, the word "organic" does not mean nutritious! Boxed mac-n-cheese isn't a nutritious choice for growing kids and, organic or not, it's a highly processed food (hint: it still has powered cheese). This food is very high in saturated fat and sodium. Plus, it doesn't contain any whole grains. Kids would be much better off getting their protein and calcium, which this product does contain, from foods not so high in saturated fats! Almost all kids really will eat, and even enjoy, whole-grain pasta, lower fat milk, 2% cheese and many other truly nutritious foods when parents make (or buy) easy, yummy and kid-friendly healthy choices!<br />P.Gould, author of Feeding the Kids: The Flexible, No-Battles, Healthy Eating System for the Whole Family

review/text: Turmeric tea? It is a lot more gingery than turmeric in flavor. I like it so much that I wouldn't change a thing. I was feeling adventurous and I picked this up. I'm so glad that I did! Usually when I buy a new tea, I might enjoy it, but I don't forsake my old favorites. With this tea, I drank almost nothing else until it was all gone! And now I crave more.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this tea is that it doesn't need anything else. To my tastebuds, it is already sweet in flavor, so I don't add any honey to my this tea, which is great for my waistline. Turmeric also shows cancer fighting properties, so I get the added benefit of feeling better about my health when I drink it.<br /><br />Not only do I love drinking this tea, I've been cooking with this tea, too. It makes for a much more interesting oatmeal breakfast.

It is strong, but I don't find it over powering.  I am accustomed to strong tasting teas though, so if you're a novice tea drinker, you might find it quite strong or even distasteful.  The ginger gives it a nice balance.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for either a ginger or turmeric flavored tea.

This is far superior to the varieties of ginger tea in bags that I have tried.  I don't notice a specific turmeric flavor, but that may be because I have a spice-heavy diet, so it is too subtle for my tastebuds to pick up and I love a good "bite" to many foods and drinks.  So far I have only tried it hot, but plan on making an iced tea version soon.  I will definitely be ordering this on a regular basis.

I like fireweed honey more as well for my less viscous honey indulgences.

review/summary: The devil is in the details--Shipping blues:(
review/text: Use this group if you don't mind getting the wrong product and then having the account executive say when responding--`everyone makes mistakes'--no apology, no oh we will refund your shipping costs--just `everyone makes mistakes'. I ordered a case of olive oil and the wrong product was shipped. WHAT a hassel!

review/summary: The good stuff
review/text: This is not one of those knock your socks off "peppery" oils, but a much more refined and subtle oil.  Grass, herbs, nice finish.  Especially good in dressings--just enough character to stand up to the vinegar and sometimes white wine}.  Not cheep, but a good value.
