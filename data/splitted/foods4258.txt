review/summary: Great for Shar Pei
review/text: I love this kibble for it contains good amount of omega oils that are needed for my shar pei sensitive skin, at the same time it has a high protien carb ratio. I don't need to add fish oil to his diet which causes him to have bad stomach/loose stools. It also gives him a really nice shinny coat.

review/summary: My dogs like it
review/text: I have always been one to try and feed my dogs a high quality food in hopes of preventing health problems down the road. With that being said, they have been eating Orijen for about the last year and a half and I have been pleased. One of my dogs likes to take a mouthful of food out of the bowl, set it on the floor and then eat it from there. It makes no sense but she has always done that. She always has pieces that she won't eat though. She will leave one or two pieces lying there on the floor and take another mouthful. She will eat that and then sniff the few she left before but leave them again and get more from the bowl. By the time she is done eating there are 15 to 20 pieces of kibble she has scattered on the floor and refuses to eat. No biggie though because my other dog comes along after she is done and cleans everything up. This has been her practice with every food I have given her over the six years I have had her.<br /><br />The reason I was looking for a different food is because Orijen is not convenient for me to get (I live in a small town 2 1/2 hours from decent shopping) and it is quite expensive. I did some research online hoping to find a quality food that I could order from Amazon and at the same time spend less money. I found this one and decided to give it a try. The first couple of days I was mixing it with Orijen but my picky dog left all the Orijen on the floor and just ate this food so I gave up on the mixing and just gave them this. Not one time did they experience loose stools or diarrhea when changing but the best part is the picky one eats every piece. I have often wished I could ask here what is wrong with the pieces she won't eat, but whatever it is this food does not have it.<br /><br />Now I can't say they have more energy or their coats are shinier or they have smaller stools than compared to when they were eating Orijen but what I can say is that I see no change. They were thriving on Orijen and they are thriving on Pinnacle. I'm saving money, it comes to my door when I need it and the dogs like it. That makes it a great food in my book.

It is a little less expensive than some of the other grain free food, and I like that this company has not been bought out by Proctor and Gamble like the others-Innova and Evo have been. They recently even removed the oats so now it just has potatos for starch. Awesome food! Dogs love it!

review/text: I had originally found these crackers at a friends house.  She told me they could be purchased at Trader Joes.  After paying way too much there, I found them on Amazon!  I'm glad I did and I ordered the six-boxes.  I go through these crackers so quickly since they are low-fat.  I have purchased other food from Amazon and I expected these crackers to come all broken.  I cracked open a box today to find them all intact!<br /><br />Great flavor, great texture.

review/summary: Love Wisecrackers, but Rosemary is a bit strong!
review/text: I have been buying these from my local grocery store for a while now and was VERY happy to see the Wisecrackers available on Amazon at about 40% below the grocery store prices (and with free delivery; they arrived well packed, in great, grocery store condition)! Cannot beat that! Aside from the price, why do I buy Wisecrackers:<br /><br />1) TEXTURE and CRUNCH: They are much tougher then regular crackers. They hold MUCH better when you need them for a dip, or a base for a topping. They allow you to "feel" the crunch and take a loooong time before getting soggy when covered with a topping.<br /><br />2) TASTE: They taste almost like bread crust, with ONLY 110 calories and 2g of fat for ten good sized crackers (each is about two inches by two inches).<br /><br />REGARDING THE FLAVOUR: I like the sesame variety the most, for their neutral aftertaste. The Rosemary/Garlic variety is not as versitile; in fact, it is quite "herby" (I am not a big fan of rosemary, so this is subjective). You will have to choose the dips and the toppings carefully. However, they can also be eaten alone, as a light in-between-meal snack.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: I fell in love with Wisecrackers in both Roasted Garlic Rosemary and Poblano Chile Sweet Onion flavors when I first discovered them at our local Trader Joe's market -- they are without doubt the best crackers I have ever tasted.  Now that they are no longer available at Trader Joe's, I was getting desperate as my stockpile was running low, and then inspiration hit ... Amazon!  Lo and behold, I found not only the two flavors with which I was familiar, but other variants as well, and ordered a ton.  I hope not to encounter the "crushed cracker" problem experienced by the earlier reviewer.  These crackers are the absolute best you can find for flavor, whether eaten alone or with dips or the like.  Everyone I have introduced them to loves them, and (as you can see) so do I.<br /><br />By the way, I did not buy these because they are "low fat".  I am a fan only because the crackers are delicious, and you would never suspect from the taste that they are "low fat".<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3SE82">Partners Wisecrackers Low Fat Crackers, Roasted Garlic Rosemary, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>Partners Wisecrackers All Natural Low Fat Crackers, Poblano Chile & Sweet Onion, 6-Count, 4-Ounce Box (Pack of 2)

review/text: My local store Trader Joe's stopped carrying Partner's Wisecrackers....my family's favorite.<br />It was a low fat, roasted garlic, and rosemary cracker that became the only cracker we ate.<br />At first they told me the warehouse ran out, then some other excuses, and finally I saw that<br />they had their own cracker being featured, and I realized that they thought they could replace<br />my favorite.  They were wrong. They told me it contained rosemary just like the other ones, but it also wasn't low fat, and they added raisons....YUK....most important, I didn't like the way they tasted. On a whim, I turned on my computer, and much to my families joy, I found them!<br />I ordered 2 cartons, and we have been in "cracker heaven" since them.

review/text: I picked up a 4-ounce box of "Wisecrackers" at my local grocery. I think I bought them because the name amused me. Well, they probably are "wise" because they are low fat and have no saturated or trans fats. No sugars either. I should add that my variety was the Roasted Garlic Rosemary variety and I had some of them with a can of smoked oysters. Nice combination, although they should go with a wide variety of things. They're nice and crisp and have a nice very light flavor. I'll be looking forward to trying some of the other varieties.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

They're very similar to the great flavor of an "everything" bagel, with poppy seeds, roasted sesame seeds, rye, onion, caraway...I plowed through half a box of these while playing a video game and still wasn't tired of them.<br /><br />Oh, speaking of eating while on the computer, these crackers have another bonus--they don't get your fingers oily or dirty. They are a very clean snack!

Funny story about these, my dog is never tied up b/c of our underground electric fence.  The UPS driver left this box with 6 bones on the front porch.  My dog has never ever touched a box that was delivered.  But I guess he smelled the bones inside.  When I got home he had three of the bones out laying on our front porch with him and he left three in the box.  I couldn't punish him for this b/c he knew the smell and the package was for him.

review/summary: Really authentic Moroccan spice blend
review/text: As with many ethnic spice mixtures, there is no one recipe for Ras el Hanout. Each family and spice merchant has their own, highly treasured and guarded version of this traditional blend. This particular product is of high quality and arrived fresh (which isn't always the case with spices that I have purchased on-line).<br /><br />Ras el Hanout starts off with strong, curry-like flavors that betrays it's Indian origins followed by subtle, traditional African flavors such as nigella and rosebuds. Although I was very pleased with this blend I do think that it is over-priced. I shop for most of my spices at ethnic markets (mostly Indian and Middle Eastern) and find their mixtures to be not only fresh but REALLY affordable. I am using this mixture with my new tagine and if I use it often enough I will seek out an African grocery store that has a similar product at a price that Moroccan expatriates will be willing to pay. If you don't live near a city that is large enough to have that type of store, then I think that this is the best Ras el Hanout available on-line. As a matter of fact, a tangine cookbook that I bought recently singled out Zamouri as THE source for this delicious, exotic blend.

This seems to me like it is neither fresh ground spices nor top of anybody's shop where I would ever purchase again.  I feel duped.  It had neither the nuance of several spices nor the fresh grind look. The blend smelled "muddy". It reminds me of $2 mixes from one of those Dollar stores.  I find that picture in the tangine to be deceptive. Put it in a small plastic store spice container the rest of the spices come in. PEOPLE, get your own favorites and grind and mix yourself in small batches, you will have a fresher & better blend.  What a $10 SHAME!!!!!!!

I bought this spice for a Moroccan lamb pie recipe that was published in Bon Apetit magazine. It was so good I'm thinking of having the recipe tattooed on my arm.  I researched this spice and found that reviewers praised this mixture from Zamouri Spices for the amount of spices used in the mix. I found this to be true, as I saw some that only used 10 different spices, where Zamouri uses over twenty. Very flavorful results. If you need Ras El Hanout, this is the seller to buy it from.

I'm glad I got a chance to try them. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />By the way, they just come tossed in a box. There is no glossy packaging. That worked fine for me because I have bought these packages before. It helps to know that so you aren't surprised when you open up the box.

review/summary: More leftovers than a sampler
review/text: Rather than a sampler of different coffee types this appears to be a way to get rid of damaged or outdated goods and get paid for it.  There was not even a good sampling, as I had three each of several blends and not one of each as I would expect from a sampler.  Just about all of the individual K-Cups were damaged in one way or another as well.

review/summary: My impulse cost me this time
review/text: I like rich, bold coffee.  I have been buying coffee through Amazon, the Keurig site, Costco, and even in a grocery store when I run low.  I am searching for the best cup for my taste.  Neumann's own is the best so far.  This sampler was appealing as a way to try many bold K cups without commiting to much to one brand.  What I failed to do was recognize the price which was almost $1 per k cup (twice as much as other purchases) and realize the sample pack would include decaf (which I did not want).  Next time I will not let my impulse cost me.

review/summary: a nice variety
review/text: I purchased this as a gift for a friend has a Keurig & has complained that his coffee isn't strong enough, & I was happy with what was received.  I had searched online for what others reported to be the "strongest" keurig cups & I believe that all of them were represented in this sampler pack.  I was pleased to see there were 2 k-cups for most flavors (nice to be able to try more than one cup to decide if you want to buy more), about 4 single samples and only one that had 3 of the same flavor.  27 of the 35 k-cups were caffeinated and 8 were decaf.  There was a nice mix of medium and dark roasts as well.  Not all are labeled as "extra bold" on the packaging, but all of the cups I received (including Coffee People's Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, Black Tiger, etc) are listed under the "extra bold" heading according to other k-cup sellers such as bigcatcoffees.com.  While they did come loose in a box, I did not notice damage to any of the cups I received.  I was pleased enough with the purchase to order a second sampler as a gift for another person.

review/summary: Great variety, bad quality
review/text: I was so excited for this sampler, I had just bought my new Keurig and was looking forward to finding my favorite coffees in this affordable package. I got the box, and was at first super excited while reading through the different types. Then for some reason, I happened to glance at the expiration date on one of the K-cups; what do you know? It expired 3 months ago. Curiosity got the best of me, and I continued to check each one. 35 K-cups later, half of the box contained expired or 1-week-away-from-expiration coffee! I consider myself a coffee-lover, and I'll try anything. BUT! Expiration dates aren't put on food for fun, and I wasn't about to drink $30 worth of old nasty coffee. I hope that this is a random occurance, but I urge everyone to check the expiration dates on their K-cups before you start brewing! Needless to say, these babies are on their way back and I'll be getting a refund.

review/text: I read the reviews on here before buying so I knew I wasn't getting a fancy package. Being totally new to my Keurig coffee maker I was after the coffee variety anyway so that was fine.  I have enjoyed just about every coffee in the box so far. I discovered early on though that you can't really make an 11.25 oz cup of coffee with on of these and have it taste decent. It just tastes watered down.  It does 9.25 oz just fine though and if you REALLY want bold coffee the 7.25 oz cup will be perfect for you.

review/text: First of all let me say, I got the coffee sooner than expected, however, I thought I bought a 'Bold' sampler. They were not all bold, which I can handle. What I didn't expect was that there was going to be ANY decaf., but I had NINE of them!!! I would generally think that most people that order bold coffee are not in search of decaf.

review/text: I took a gamble, thinking this sounded like a fun idea, even though I had seen some less-than-glowing reviews.<br /><br />I really didn't care about the jumbled mess these come in, or the pretty beat-up condition of some of the K-cups. They are all in date, to my pleasure included a couple of recently discontinued varieties, and being a little scuffed up won't hurt them.<br /><br />What did NOT please me was that at least HALF of the K-cups in this sampler were NOT Extra Bold varieties. Worse, 3 of the included K-cups were decaf (1 Extra Bold and 2 not).<br /><br />Seemed kind of festive getting that big box, but the contents are a bit of a letdown. From now on, I'll stick with ordering the specific K-cup varieties that I want rather than try one of these samplers again.

Why would you not include this in the description of the combo pack?  Most coffee drinkers shop specifically for decaf and now I have samples I will never use.  Secondly, there were 6 "extra bold" flavors in my Medium Roast combo pack.  Again, this is NOT what I ordered.  I guess I will have to go back to ordering from Big Cat or someone else who actually labels their product correctly.

review/text: I am really picky with coffee. I'd rather not drink it then drink a cup of weak, brown colored water. This affliction for beyond bold, strong and good coffee does not always serve me well, i.e diners, friends who settle for ...foldgers. But I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy almost every cup in the sampler. There are a few that are not quite as bol like the Emeril brand and the Donut Shoppe brand. They were my least favorite, but the rest really pack a nice punch. And the Revv and the Dark Magic were stand outs. It would be nice if there was a way to design your own sampler pack.. Is there?? Regardless, this one is a good one for anyone who needs the bold power. and will not dissapoint.

For example: Golden French Toast, Gingerbread, Butter Toffee, Mudslide, Cinnamon Roll, Chocolate Glazed Donut, and a frickin' Spiced Apple Tea, that's not even coffee!<br /><br />I wouldn't buy from here if I were you, there's a lot of mixed reviews, some people  are getting what they wanted but a lot aren't.  I say it's too much of a gamble for how much you spend on the box.

It was left in the cupboard for a few weeks unopened.  I was not sure about the food preparation standards in Vietnam.  However, after trying Vinacaf&eacute;, I was surprised at how good it was.  I went through all 20 packets very quickly.  Each packet already has instant coffee, creamer, and sugar mixed in.  You don't need to add anything.<br /><br />Vinacaf&eacute; is pretty good, equal to American brands.  However, remember Vinacaf&eacute; is made in Vietnam.  They may or may not have the same food preparation standards as the USA.  Until I learn differently, I would still buy Vinacaf&eacute;.

Not the best price out there but the mini packs are useful for kid snacks.<br /><br />The pricing math is just relevant because these are my favourite gummies EVER and they are best shopped for at a per-piece cost since they are kind of expensive and can be bought in several different package types.

review/summary: Mario: Get Out of the Gummi Game
review/text: We used to love "Au'some" fruit nuggets...they were kind of the misshapen "Chicklets" of the fruit snack world. They were not sugar-laden, and always tasted fresh. They are hard to find in our neck of the woods. So when my mom got these for my rats, yes, I was excited. They are all natural and made in a nut-free facility. They are made "responsibly" in China. Wait- did I mention that they taste horrific? If you crave the taste of plastic tinged with rubber, then go for these. Taste-testers/samplers at "Au'some": What the heck happened? Are the testers elderly, have sinus disorders, or both? Sorry, folks, not awesome at all.

review/summary: Love, love, love this mocha sauce
review/text: Regarding the product: I love the Fontana bittersweet chocolate sauce! I use this to create great-tasting mochas at home. It is close to what is used at Starbucks, but not quite exact. But it doesn't have to be. In fact I love my home mochas just as much as the ones at SB.<br /><br />The only negative feedback I have is that I wish it shipped from Amazon so that I could use Amazon Prime membership. And Cooking.com packages it as though it were made out of glass. Tons of bubblewrap all taped together, foam peanuts, etc. There's really no need for that amount of packaging on this product, and I feel it is a waste to have to throw that all that packaging away, especially since I order this frequently.

review/summary: It got there, but disappointed.
review/text: I give this item 3 stars because I sent this package to a friend who lost her father. About a week later, after not getting a thank you (which is out of character for my friend) I reached out to see if she had received the package (very tacky), she said she had been wondering who sent it for days. I filled out the message that was supposed to be sent along with the package, but apparently it never got to her. I read that others had this problem in the reviews, but was hoping it had been fixed, but no it has not. She said she enjoyed the package, but it would have been nice to have my message go along with the package so I would not have to ask if she got it, which can be pretty awkward and tacky especially during such a touchy time. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAH13A">Art of Appreciation Gift Baskets Small With Heartfelt Sympathy</a>

All right, that doesn't happen very often - I can usually handle a whole pot.  But when I want a quick cup, I don't want to be grinding beans, getting out a filter and going through all the same steps as making a whole pot.  These filter packs are the perfect solution at a great price!  The coffee is almost as good as Starbucks for a fraction of the price.

review/text: I don't go through some fresh produce fast enough to make them worth purchasing, so the dried shallots were a great find.  To give an idea of how much 'volume' they take up, I used a plastic 8 ounce baby bottle with a baby juice-bottle cap, and peeled the label off of the bag, to tape onto the bottle- the shallots come up to approximately the 7 1/2 ounce mark.  I'll order these again, simply because there is no waste, and the product is good.  :)
