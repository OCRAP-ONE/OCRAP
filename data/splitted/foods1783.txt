review/summary: Arrived slightly damaged but still works
review/text: I received this product promptly but when it arrived the cap had been slightly damaged.  It looked like something very heavy had been put on top of it and crushed it a bit.  One edge of the cap was bent.  However, it only took a little work with some pliers to straighten it out and it screwed onto the jar easily.<br /><br />Apart from that small damage it works as advertised and is a good deal at the price paid.

review/summary: Good Value!
review/text: I love natural Peanut Butter however avoided it occasionally due to the thought of making a mess and the time involved in stirring it up. Took a chance with this mixer and I am very happy with the purchase. Have only used it a couple of times so not sure how well it will hold up over time (reason for only 4 stars). Mixer pulls through the lid clean which is a nice plus. Would recommend this to a friend.

review/summary: A great device for natural peanut butter!
review/text: I think this invention is amazing - it stirs my peanut butter without the mess and in half the time that using a spoon would.  I can't believe I didn't know about it earlier in life!<br /><br />I took off 1 star because the lid does not fit my 16oz Kroger Natural peanut butter jars.  I just hold the lid on and stir while pushing down on the top.  The lid fits great on the 16oz Marnatha almond butter jars I buy.  I know the company makes other sizes, but since this is the one I ordered (touted as the "most common"), I will make do.

review/summary: Easy help to enjoying your peanut butter faster
review/text: I just used the peanut butter mixer for the first time and I love this thing.<br /><br />I used to dread mixing the natural peanut butter because all the oil would go all over the place and it would never mix thoroughly. I'd try to take my time so neither of the above would occur but it rarely worked out.<br /><br />With this gizmo, you screw it on, put the mixer through the wee hole, crank it for a bit, unscrew it, make a sandwich and watch some TV. If you're going to be healthy might as well not have to fight with it.<br /><br />Bottom line: it's clean and easy. You won't regret it.

review/summary: Got the right size, but it doesn't work....
review/text: There is a design flaw in that it only stirs the bottom 1/4" of the jar as some other reviewers have mentioned. Tried it vertical and horizontal and also tried long duration of cranking, but the gravitational pull where I am (500' above sea level) isn't strong enough to draw the unstirred peanut butter into the stirring rod.  It probably works fine in death valley but am going to return it since it's summer there now which would boil the peanut butter into a stirred state.<br /><br />On the bright side, the rod was clean enough after removing to put back in the package for return shipping. I was really hoping this gadget would work.

review/text: I bought one of these peanut butter stirrers in a general store years ago.  I love it and wanted to get one for a friend for Christmas.  Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong size lid and was unable to give it to her.  When I looked up to get the right size lid it is very hard to figure out what size lid I need.  I am still waiting to return the wrong one and order the right one.  Hopefully I haven't waited too long to return it!  I wish the sizing included the size (or how many ounces) of the peanut butter jar and not metric measurements for lid.

review/text: Add hot water, wait a few minutes and it's a decent hot and sour soup.  About middling by Chinese restaurant standards, which is pretty remarkable for a dry packaged product.  Its also fairly filling, although if one had a single 'serving' of half a container, it'd be pretty meager fare.  Who consumes just half a container of instant noodle soup?  So four points for the product, minus a point for absurdity in nutritional labeling.

review/summary: Could use some more heat
review/text: This soup was just OK, not bad, not especially good.  I would have liked it better if it were a little hotter.  After adding several drops of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZSYS">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red 12 oz.</a> sauce it tasted better.  I understand that a lot of people don't like foods that are too hot, but this was just a little spicy, not hot at all.  If it were called "Spicy and Sour Soup" I would have given it 4 stars.<br /><br />The amount filled the cup pretty well, unlike Dr. McDougall's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040WE8NE">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Asian Entree, Pad Thai Noodle, 2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> which contained very little noodles and didn't even fill half the cup.  It didn't really taste like the hot and sour soup I get in some restaurants but I don't really expect fast food in a cup to be like the fresh version.  It was easy enough to prepare:  just pull open the top on the cup, add the included flavoring packet and stir a bit, add water to the fill line and then microwave for 1 minute and 45 seconds or pour boiling water to the fill line and then let it sit for about 5 minutes.  It would be good for lunch at work or when traveling where often it's hard to find quick vegan soups.<br /><br />The label on this cup says it contains 2 servings and each is 85 calories.  The total weight of the dry ingredients is 1.9 ounces.  The serving size is 27 grams or .9523 ounces (plus water, of course)  Seriously?  I can't imagine splitting this cup of noodles into two servings, particularly since it's a fast food with only one cup provided.  But then, maybe I'm just a big eater.<br /><br />I thought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFIEL2">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Black Bean & Lime Soup, 3.4-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a> was a tastier choice.

review/summary: Fantastic Ramen to go when it comes to flying & being a vegan!
review/text: It is so difficult to find that flavour at the local groceries for that brand, I'm not sure what is exactly going on, but I cannot live without a vegan hot and sour noodle soup. It only appeals to me because I love anything with noodles and "hot-and-sour"! I used them for traveling, especially on long international flights where they don't serve the best vegan meals. There were couple of times that I wasn't served a vegan meal on my flights(oh, that was downright awful!), and I have this brilliant vegan hot and sour soup noodle cup to go (even packed an extra in case I'm hungry!). All I have to do is ask the flight attendants to fill the cup with hot water (that is just like filling a cup of hot tea or coffee!) The flight attendants complimented about it and said it was a clever idea for someone who is a vegan! And I am pleased that I have these vegan cups to go!<br /><br />Few cons about it:<br />1. I wish there's more of that, please double that quantity! Sometimes I ended up eating two as a complete dinner meal!<br />2. I wish there are more cilantro or green onion on it especially more shiitake mushrooms! More toppings, please!<br />3. I like it to be a bit more spicier, maybe add an extra seasoning for "SPICY" for people who preferred a spicier soup.<br />4. Where are the tofu? I know they are dehydrated, but want more tofu or perhaps more mushrooms.<br />5. I want more. More. More.

The smell usually went away after a while (or I got used to it) but was the main disconcerting part.<br /><br />The tofu pieces are TINY and don't really taste like tofu....<br /><br />I didn't try microwaving it, as the hot water option was good with 15 min sitting time.<br /><br />After the first 3, I would separate the noodles and use them in other recipes but it would still have the same smell, so the problem was in the noodles and not the spices. A friend said that's normal in such noodles.<br /><br />Might not buy again.

Mabe Vegans don't like good food, I think they do, but from the reviews of this soup I wonder.<br /><br />On the positive, why I left 3 stars is the noodles are ok, and they are filling. I had to pour some Terriaki sauce in this to make it have some flavor, probably won't order agian, but not so bad I can't eat the 6 that came.<br /><br />In closing I believe if you like Hot and Sour soup from your local Chinese Resteraunt this might leave you wanting more. Just my opinion. But in all fairness I never eat vegan food, so this could be knocking it out of the park in the vegan world and I would never know. I admittibly like eggs swirled through mine like at the resteraunts, probably not vegan, and they probably use part chicken broth with their water, not vegan. So this may be as good as water and spices get! I wouldn't know. I just know if your not vegan, and enjoy a good piece of filet or enjoy some pork in your hot and sour soup like it is made at a buffet then something might be sorely missing for you.<br /><br />One last thought, the soup says to let set with lid on 5 minutes after cooking, I left it on 9. I will say I let it set about 15 and it improved the flavor some. If you have the time to wait this definetely makes it better, to its credit.

review/text: I was introduced to quaker oats maple and brown sugar instant by a friend.  I have found myself eating it on a fairly regular basis ever since.  It is easy to make, tastes great and is a warm, hearty breakfast during this cold winter.  I find that made with water it comes out perfectly thick and creamy.The only negative if you could call it that is that you need to watch it in the microwave should you choose to make it that way.  I found a tremendous difference between my friend's and mines (all are different that's a given) in their's no matter what I did I always had a spillover in mine the 2 min is fine with no spillover or mess whatsoever.

review/summary: Great stuff, easy preparation, seemingly healthy, kids love it
review/text: We all just love this Quaker oat meal. It takes 2 minutes per bowl in the microwave (so if you are 5 people it takes a little time), is seemingly healthy, and our junior (3 years) loves it, too.<br /><br />It can be prepared with water, milk, or a mixture of the two. More milk makes it thicker and smoother.<br /><br />A kind of downside is that the consistency ("thickness") depends on the mixture of water and milk, the microwave's energy, and even the bowl shape and size (probably it's all about the diameter). One needs to experiment a little with the timing the microwave is set to to prepare it to one's liking.<br />It mixes better if you stir it after a minute in the microwave.<br /><br />All in all, we all love it, and in particular the brown sugar flavor.

review/text: I discovered this product about a year ago and have not used dehydrated boullion since. It's so convenient to make -- just boil the amount of water you need and add the appropriate amount of base. It blends quickly too. No more undissolved bouillon pebbles in the bottom of the broth!<br /><br />We're a family of 2 so I was worried that they'd go bad on me before I had a chance to use it all, but I've had open jars stored in the fridge for a few months at a time and have never had a problem. I've also purchased the chicken base and am just as pleased. Wonderful products!

review/text: This is indeed better than bouillon--as we all know, that's not saying jack, but it's a truly decent product. The beef flavor is definitely nice and rich, but you should taste everything you add this to as you add it so you don't throw off the salt levels. This stuff is sal-tee, with a capital salty. On the other hand, it keeps forever, and the flavor is perfect. It would just be nice to be able to make the beef flavor a little stronger without turning your soup or stew into a brine, and the amount of salt in this stuff makes it hard to find a good balance.

review/summary: Beef Stock Paste - Way Better than Bouillon
review/text: If you love buying roast beef you can layer slices on fresh French bread, then dip the sandwiches in a delicious flavored beef bouillon. The flavor can be greatly enhanced by using this stock base.<br /><br />A dipping sauce can be made with � cup water, 2 bay leaves, � teaspoon beef base, 1 teaspoon Italian tomato paste, � teaspoon dried parsley, � teaspoon dried minced onion and 1/8 teaspoon dried thyme. Heat in a saucepan and then simmer for a few minutes until slightly reduced and it tastes rich and delicious.<br /><br />Better Than Bouillon is a stock paste or more like a beef base than a bouillon cube. Dry bouillon cubes are famous for being overly salty and that is why beef base is a much healthier, not to mention, tasty alternative. This beef base also contains garlic, onion and spices.<br /><br />One teaspoon of bouillon blended into one cup of hot water makes one cup of beef stock. To make gravy, I use two tablespoons butter and two tablespoons flour plus the stock and a sprinkling of freshly ground pepper and various dried herbs and spices. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, whisk in the flour and then the stock.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: ok, but use sparingly
review/text: I've always hated bouillon, I'm a person who just craves the real thing, and this did help in a pinch.  I had both the beef and the vegetable products in my fridge for quite a few years as a staple.  If my homemade soup ended up a bit flat tasting, I'd add some of this. Or, if I needed beef or veg broth for a stir-fry, I'd whip up a bit.  It is easy to just make a little bit, as you need it. However, I started to notice that if I made a soup which depended on this as the foundation base,  I would get quite sick  after eating a large bowl of the soup.  I actually think that I was having some type of high blood pressure bout as a result of the extremely high sodium.  The soup tasted good, but for my body, it's too much sodium.  If you use it, use sparingly!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor...make your own. This is what I do now to get the best "base" imaginable at NO cost:  everytime I pan fry a steak, pork chops or chicken breasts without any plan to make a pan sauce, I deglaze the hot pan immediately with water, let it reduce a bit,  pour the result into a small 1 cup plastic glad/ziplock container, and pop it into the freezer.  Any fat floats to the top and gets removed when I go to use it. Sometimes, it is pretty salty, if my meat was more highly seasoned, but the meat flavor is very potent and is mixed with water when I make soup, so it's never been too salty for my needs, and I always wait until I've used my broth stash before adding add'l sodium.  Honestly, this is a wonderful technique.  I keep one little plastic container for chicken, and another for beef and pork, mixed.  I just keep adding to the little container each time I cook (topping it off) and if it gets full, I start another one.  I get maybe 1/4-1/2 cup of liquid from each deglazing but it is quadruple the flavor of a can of broth.  This is the best trick I've ever come up up with in the kitchen and now when I make soup, the broth is always my favorite part and it never tastes like bouillon. Besides, you have to wash the pan anyways, so it's easiest to just deglaze it asap.<br /><br />Ok, if you're reading this far, you probably liked my idea...so you will not believe when I tell you that you can make the BEST chicken broth from the chicken SKIN scraps that you remove from chicken.  I know, I know, it sounds  terrible...but there is flavor in that skin and fat which can flavor your water, and then you remove the fat when it cools.  You can save up the skin in the freezer and do a big batch, or just do little bits at a time...put the chicken skin/fat trims/any raw bones into some water.  Bring it just to a boil, then immediately turn it down low and let it sit for any amount of time you feel like...at least 1/2 hour, all day if you want.  Then, strain it.  If you want to reduce it, cook it some more, then you don't have to store such a large quantity. Put it in the fridge, the fat will float to the top, skim it off, and put the broth in the freezer. (I often use quart-sized ziplock bags.)  Free, No Sodium, HIGH Chicken Flavor like you won't believe.  Virtually no work.  If you use a lot of garlic in your cooking, throw a whole garlic clove or two in the pot at the onset.  I never throw away chicken skin anymore and regret the years of Swanson's chicken broth that I bought, watered down stuff that, to my opinion, has virtually no flavor.  (The reason you don't boil this, is your broth will be more clear if you don't...but it'll still taste fine if you accidentally let it boil.)

If you put a small sample in your mouth, you can feel and taste the individual salt grains.<br /><br />I looked on the back of a can of Morton salt  - 1.5 gm of Morton iodized salt has 590 mg of Sodium, which comes down to 393.33 mg of Sodium per 1 gm of table salt.<br /><br />Which means that this "Better than Bouillon" Beef flavor has 1.8 gm of table salt per 6 gm (teaspoon) serving size,  which means that SALT is the single largest ingredient in this product.<br /><br />The beef flavor is pretty decent, but it is just overwhelmed by the salt.<br /><br />Sorry, but for people that can't take or don't like so much salt in their diet, this stuff won't work.

review/summary: Beefy - Not Too Salty
review/text: Better Than Bouillon was #1 in the PBS "Test Kitchen" cooking show.  I finally found it at Amazon but it is pricier here than at your grocery store.  I used my rewards points on my Amazon Visa Card and Super Saver Shipping.<br /><br />This has a very good beefy taste.  You can make an Au-juis or boil it and it becomes thicker.<br /><br />I made a pot roast.  Cook the meat, potatoes, onions, carrots and garlic in a watery gravy and let it thicken up during the cooking process adding water as needed.  Don't add salt when cooking, just pepper.  Taste to see if you should add salt once cooked as it adds a salty taste but not overly so.  I also lightly mash some of the potatoes and mix it with the gravy.<br /><br />I then made a thinner gravy to pour on top.  Very good.<br /><br />Delivery was fast.

review/summary: worth the price - bouillon with quality ingredients
review/text: I'll admit this product is pricier than standard bouillon, but after I compared at the ingredients list to others I decided to buy this one.<br /><br />I recently found this after looking for some bouillon to make my food go farther on low calories. Comparing the nutrition facts and ingredients of this to the OTHER bouillon products are what led me to choose this product. Some of the read they had salt, sugar, MSG, beef fat, or partially hydrogenated oils. No way! So I appreciate when the manufacturer is considerate and leaves out the harmful ingredients in favor of quality ones.<br /><br />Maybe the worst ingredient in this is corn oil, but it's the second-to-last ingredient. Roasted beef is the first. One thing I can tell you is, the 10 calories per serving of this product is going to made up of mostly protein, whereas the 10 calories from the other bouillon products is going to be mostly fat, trans-fat, starch, or sugar.<br /><br />The pasty consistency is easier to use, in my opinion, than having cubes. Sometimes I like to use the stuff right out of the jar and don't want to wait for it to dissolve.

review/text: My husband brought home this beef base.  I read the ingredients, and the first item listed was "roasted beef."  So, the next time I made a big pot of beef stew, I put a slightly rounded teaspoon of the base in it, thinking I could add more if I wanted to.  Oh, my, Better Than Bouillon ramped up the flavor of my stew from delicious to gimme more!<br /><br />Since all bouillon has salt in it, I cut back a little on the salt I put in the stew.  But, BTB has far less sodium than other bouillons I've seen on the grocery shelf.  Back at Christmas, I had tried a liquid chicken bouillon product, but it was so loaded with sodium, I had to throw out my giblet gravy.<br /><br />Now, I even add just the tip of a teaspoon of BTB in my ground chuck for hamburgers.  Whatever beef dish you're making will be enhanced with just a little of this stuff.  Hmmmmm, wonder how BTB would work in my marinade for a slow-cooked beef brisket?  Oh, yeah, I'm gonna try that!<br /><br />And, can't you just imagine how a little of their ham base will taste in a pot of ham and beans?!  I'm ordering the chicken and ham versions from Amazon.

review/summary: GOOD FLAVORING FOR BEEF STEW
review/text: Cooking beef stew from scratch is time consuming, hence I take two shortcuts:  pre cut carrots and bouillon.  Better Than Bouillon Beef Base, while not entirely free of artificial ingredients, produces a better stew than pre made stews in my opinion.  I have several food allergies but for me this product is not a problem.  Salt content is high, but this is not a problem for me as nothing else in my stew has added salt. If anything else had salt added then the salt content of this beef base would be too high.  Fresh raw meat and vegetables soak up flavor as the stew cooks.  Some frozen vegetables are full of added salt, so I don't use them.  Roast beef from a deli can have added salt and MSG.  I have not tried Better Than Bouillon low salt version yet.<br /><br />This item is getting harder to find as people are forced to use fast food, as work pressures increase.  Cruising around looking for a few items, in my experience, wastes enough time, gas and car wear to erase the sometimes higher cost of buying online.  So far our stores are only out of stock for two weeks at a time, but in many areas supplies for cooking from scratch are very limited.  hence it is good to see products like this on Amazon.

Two of the ingredients are just another name for MSG!  Autolyzed yeast and Hydrolyzed protein.  What a bummer.  I have major health issues and try to avoid msg at all costs.  I will not be purchasing these again.  In fact the jars I have in the house now will be tossed.  It isn't worth the health issues!  I would like to find a bouillon product that doesn't contain any hidden msg.

review/summary: I don't think you'll find any better
review/text: I have been feeding Blue Buffalo almost exclusively for about eight years now, and couldn't be happier. Prior to switching to Blue, one of my cats, who was twelve then, was losing fur to a point where she was bald nearly everywhere that she could reach, as she was licking and chewing constantly. She looked like she had mange, except I don't think that cats get mange. I took her to a couple of veterinarians. One insisted that she was overly sensitive to fleas, although we weren't finding any fleas. That didn't make sense to me since I had inspected her carefully and I knew that, with five cats, if one of them had fleas, they'd all have fleas. Another vet put her on steroids, which seemed to help some, except that it changed her personality, and that wasn't something I was willing to leave her on for life. Then someone mentioned food allergies, particularly to corn, soy and wheat. Not knowing any better, I had been feeding Science Diet, which was recommended by the veterinarian.<br /><br />I looked for something without corn, soy and wheat. At first, I tried some other premium food, and her fur started to grow back. I tried a few different premium foods, always making sure that they did not include corn, soy or wheat. Some my cats liked better than others, but I didn't find any that all of my cats liked. Learning more about feline nutrition, I began looking at what the foods did have in them, as well as what they did not have.<br /><br />When I came across Blue Buffalo, the idea of the Life Source Bits made sense to me. We began feeding Blue to our cats and all of them loved it. My wife came across one of the Blue representatives in a Petco store, and she and I both ended up working for Blue for a few years, both in Maine and in North Carolina. It was nice to be able to represent a product that I believed in entirely. I no longer work for Blue, but I continue to feed Blue Buffalo to my cats. The only kibble that they eat is made by Blue Buffalo, and about fifty percent of their canned food is also made by Blue.<br /><br />Three of my cats are twenty-one now, and a fourth is ten years old. The fifth died of cancer when she was a few months short of twenty-four years old. Given the age of my three older cats, I am a little more concerned about their hydration now than before, so I feed them more canned food than I would if they were younger. They appreciate variety in their canned food so I mix some other brands of premium canned food whose ingredients I approve of. Even with the canned food, however, all of my cats like the Blue Buffalo selections, and at least one of my cats will turn away from nearly every other brand that I have tried, the exception being Petco's premium house brand, Soulistic, which has good ingredients and all of my cats like it.<br /><br />I rarely feed them kibble other than Blue. Although I alternate between the Blue Buffalo kibble selections from time to time, my cats never tire of Blue Buffalo, and I wouldn't want to be without the good results that I have seen from it.<br /><br />All three of my twenty-one year old cats are healthy and active. Veterinarians who haven't seen them before invariably guess their ages as being a third to a fourth of what their ages really are. One of them has arthritis but you'd never know it as long as she's taking her supplement - another reason for feeding them canned food each day, since I can hide the supplement in the canned food. Other than that, they have no issues whatsoever. They play, they fight, and they climb. Being cats, of course they also sleep a lot.<br /><br />Their fur is beautiful, even the one who was once bald. Here's another huge plus, one that I wasn't allowed to talk about while I was representing Blue Buffalo. Although my cats are allowed to go outside whenever they want to (in Maine, it's not as if they're playing in the street), I have not had a problem with fleas since I began feeding them Blue Buffalo. This has been true even in summers when neighbors are complaining about fleas being a particular problem. If they are outside in the summer, I take sensible precautions and comb them out frequently, particularly if I see one of them scratching, but I haven't seen more than three fleas in eight years. My cats are not treated with poisons, either. Blue Buffalo is not a remedy for fleas, but good nutrition assists the cat's natural defenses, I believe.<br /><br />One thing that many people are concerned about when considering Blue Buffalo or another premium brand of cat food is the price. Yes, you will pay more per pound for Blue Buffalo than you would for a store brand. When you look beyond that, you will see the cost savings, however.<br /><br />Cats don't digest corn, soy or wheat very well. When you feed a cheaper cat food (and even some of the more expensive brands) that consists mostly of stuff they can't digest, much of what you are paying for ends up in the litter box. I can assure you that my litter boxes don't fill nearly as quickly now, as they did when I was feeding Science Diet to my cats, and what is in there doesn't smell as bad. The last time I checked, Science Diet was even more expensive than Blue Buffalo. Whatever you are feeding your cats, if the chief ingredients are corn, soy, wheat, or something else that isn't meat, poultry or fish, you might consider that you are feeding the litter box, so you should add in the extra cost of cat litter.<br /><br />I don't know how many people I have come across who talk about their cats, half the age of my own, as being old. Many people are paying high veterinary bills for health problems that may not be necessary if they were eating a healthier diet. With three twenty-one year old cats and one ten year old, my cats see the veterinarian rarely, and only for preventative checkups. Even the one with arthritis is successfully treated with Cosequin, an over the counter supplement that I buy here on Amazon.com.<br /><br />I won't go so far as to say that Blue Buffalo is the only cat food that you should feed to your cat. In canned foods, there are several other good choices, some of which I buy as treats for those of my cats who like them. There are other dry cat foods that use real meat as the first ingredient, and which avoid corn, soy and wheat. My cats prefer Blue, and I think there is something to be said for the Life Source Bits that are found only in Blue.<br /><br />That's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it.

review/summary: Great value!
review/text: Blue Buffalo is pretty pricey, especially for a first-time switcher from cheaper store brands. However, I cannot say enough good things about this product. The person I adopted my cat from used to feed him premium organic food (not Blue). Thinking it was way too expensive (especially on a grad student budget), I gradually switched his food to IAMS. I immediately noticed troublesome changes: he started shedding like crazy, his poop was watery and sometimes even bloody, his fur lost its initial luster and became "stiffer." He was still the same cat, running around, all skittish and crazy, but he wasn't quite what he used to be. After trying several other "better" brands---none of which turned him around---I decided that I was going to be wasting more money bringing him to the vet and adding other weird supplements to his diet. Checking the ingredient list on the other premium foods, most of them listed random by-products, corn, and wheat as their primary ingredients. So, you are basically plunking down loads of cash for these supposed "premium" brands which are pretty much the same as the cheaper store brand ones. I had a hunch my cat was sensitive to corn and wheat, so I looked for a better brand of cat food where there is none of these ingredients whatsoever. I finally decided on Blue Buffalo, as I liked the fact that it had minimal ingredients and had high levels of protein. Within a couple of days, my cat stopped shedding loads of fur, his poop, while still stinky, is no longer watery/bloody, and his fur has become so soft, lush, and luxurious that it's impossible to stop hugging him (he hates being squeezed so much!). As for my cat, he loves is so much, and as one reviewer has already noted, he is eating less of the food, which means you don't really end up paying that much, as a little does go a long way. My cat's on the bigger side (almost 20 pounds and a little over 2 ft from tip of nose to base of his tail), and he used to eat more than the recommended amount of the other ones we've tried. For Blue Buffalo though, he seems to eat less than the recommended amount but has maintained a healthy weight for his size.

I transfered it to several Ziplock freezer bags and the food's maintained its freshness quite well.<br /><br />My cat transitioned to Blue Buffalo without any trouble. I mixed it with her previous food only once and she was fine.<br /><br />She maintained a slimmer profile before Blue Buffalo however. I used to let her "free feed" her, but now I am considering regimented meals. I am guessing that she enjoys the food enough that she is eating more than she needs just because of the taste.

review/summary: Rejuvenated!
review/text: Kitty's been eating ONE for several years and started throwing up her food pretty often right after she'd eaten... no evidence of hairballs.  I thought it might be a food allergy.  After reading a lot of reviews, I tried Blue Buffalo Indoor Cat Dry Food.<br /><br />Since we started Blue about 3 weeks ago these are some changes I've noticed:<br /><br />She eats EVERY BITE and licks her bowl clean. She never finished her ONE before she asked for more.  It lost its appetizing smell pretty quickly.<br /><br />She hasn't thrown up.<br /><br />She's 10 years old and slept almost all the time. After a few weeks of Blue, she's started making her hunting rounds like the old days, checking the walls and hide-y holes for geckos, bugs and whatnot.  Didn't find any, but she's on the lookout!<br /><br />She started initiating play-fights with my husband when he walks by.<br /><br />Last night she threw a toy mouse out of her bed and chased it around for 15 minutes.  No catnip was involved!  I keep finding her 3 mice in different places so she has been entertaining herself while we're away.<br /><br />The only change has been the Blue.  She's re-energized and engaged.  I thought she was bored, old, and sleeping her life away; who knew it was a nutrition problem?  Thanks BLUE BUFFALO for reviving and rejuvenating our sweet Kitty!<br /><br />update: 8/8/12<br /><br />When I first read Kaonick's review I laughed out loud, "3. All of my kitties are SO SOFT now it's ridiculous".  But now MY Kitty is ridiculously soft!  She's also put her weight back on since she was sick in March.  We've cut back on the amount we feed her at once and just give her  little meals several times a day and she's happy.  No more vomiting and she is still licking her bowl clean.  ;-B

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: I had been looking for a new cat food for my 10 cats---yes 10---for awhile since the quality of Iams (which I had been feeding them)seemed to have gone downhill since P&G bought them out.  The cats seemed to start throwing up more and their poop was getting stinkier.  We have all types of cats in our house...some purebreed, some shelter mutts, some young, some old, and a couple overweight so it was hard to find something that EVERYONE could tolerate AND not have them throw up or stink me out of the house.<br /><br />We landed on Blue Buffalo after taking a trip to PetSmart to once again try to find a food for everyone and the rep from Blue Buffalo was there and suggested the food.  I didn't have anything to lose since the other high quality foods (Royal Canin, Nutro, Eukanuba, and Science Diet) that we tried has failed in one aspect or another.<br /><br />We have been feeding the brood Blue Buffalo for about a year now and so far so good.  They haven't gained any weight (and we let them eat whenever), their coats look great, no one has been sick, and throw up is few and far between.  I will admit that in the beginning when we switched them over, their poop did stink horribly, but after about two weeks their bodies got used to it(and yes--we mixed their food when we switched) and it is OK now.  It will smell, of course when they first poop, but once they cover it, it is fine.  Some of the other food we tried made the whole house smell like a barnyard and gave the cats gas!  Nothing like a cat jumping up into your lap and farting...LOL!<br /><br />I like the fact too that they use great ingredients and not by-products.  We will be sticking with Blue as long as it works for us.

They also poop less. Now, who can beat that? :)<br /><br />This is a solid company with solid principles. Although the price is a little bit more expensive, it is worth it. Also, since the cats eat less of this food than the others, it ends up being about the same price for a month's worth of food. Maybe only a little more $.<br /><br />I recently went through a couponing/tight budgeting phase and was giving my cats the cheaper, discounted, coupon-deal food. After a few months, I switched back. There are only a few brands I am loyal too, and this is one of them without a doubt.

However, I was willing to pay a bit extra to make sure my kitty was getting an appropriate diet. This was a great find. I got a 7lb bag on sale at PetSmart for $15, which I considered a great price, especially for higher quality food. My cat absolutely loves it and gobbles it up as soon as I put it in his bowl. I've noticed a lot less shedding and his coat and soft and shiny. My only complaint is that it makes his poop stink to high heaven! I have a feeling that's a product of any high protein diet, though, so I'm not sure I can do much more about that.<br /><br />All in all, though, I think this is a great find and a good price!

review/summary: My cats like it and are healthy
review/text: This is a good product.  It's more expensive than typical supermarket cat foods, but you get what you pay for.  Blue Buffalo is one of about a half-dozen upscale, healthier, more expensive cat food brands.  Though there are proponents and detractors of each brand, honestly, they seem all to be on a similar plane in terms of the quality and healthiness of the food (Blue Buffalo, Evo, Innova, Wellness, etc.).  After reading a gazillion websites, I concluded that Wellness Core is probably the healthiest dry food out there, but our three cats don't like it much - it's like feeding string beans day after day to a kid; they just won't eat it.  They *love* the taste of Blue Buffalo.  So we mix 1/2 Wellness Core with 1/2 Blue Buffalo Indoor Cat Dry to try to get the best of both worlds.  I can't overemphasize how much all three of our cats like the taste of the BB dry.  They will eat it as a meal, or mixed in with wet food, or even as their 11 pm snack-treat, when they are at their most finicky and demanding. All three of our cats like a wide variety of the Blue Buffalo flavors, but this particular product (for whatever reason) has really worked out well as the core of their diet.  There's no question that a lot of things improved with our cats, from digestion to fecal habits to coat shininess and smoothness, when we transitioned them over to Blue Buffalo.  I'm very satisfied with Blue Buffalo and with this product.

review/summary: This food is a godsend!
review/text: This was the fourth brand I tried due to my female shorthair cat's frequent vomiting without any sign of hairballs.  She started out with original Cat Chow, then I tried Eukanuba hairball formula, and eventually Science Diet sensitive stomach formula, which was by far the most problematic, causing her to throw up at least once daily.  My vet recommended a natural brand, and a Petsmart employee suggested the Blue Buffalo indoor formula specifically.  That was about three weeks ago, and knock on wood, she hasn't vomited once since.  Not only that, but she's actually become more affectionate now that she's not in a constant state of discomfort and stomach distress.  Her chronic dandruff has also almost completely disappeared, and both of my cats are shedding quite a bit less.  Their coats are softer and shinier than they've ever been before, and to top it all off, since Blue Buffalo has no fillers, they're actually getting full while eating less of it, and are defecating less frequently.  This food was truly a godsend for my sensitive-stomach kitty, and the additional coat benefits were amazing and completely unexpected.  I will offer the warning, however, that although my cats took to BB immediately when it was slowly mixed in with their old food, my mom's cats refuse to eat it.  I recommend buying different flavors one at a time in the smallest quantity available until you make sure you've found one your cat(s) will eat.  Definitely worth the price, especially if, like me, you've been buying expensive Eukanuba or Science Diet already!

Hey it's cheaper, you get what you pay for.<br />[...]

review/summary: The absolute best!
review/text: I can't say enough good things about this brand. I love it so much I emailed the company to let them know. My cat's coat is so glossy, smooth and she rarely sheds. She LOVES this food. I can't free feed her because she will eat all of it! It also has seemed to help regulate her weight. She put on a few pounds after being spayed and now she's starting to look slim again. Her eyes are clear and her energy levels are through the rough. Seriously, give this food a try. I did after researching foods here on amazon and I won't switch to anything else. The only drawback is the price-$20 for a 13 lb bag, but I have just the one cat and this bag lasts a long, long time. I'm going to switch my dog over to Blue Buffalo-the company kindly helped me choose a diet through a series of emails. I can't afford (nor do I really want to fool with it) to feed my animals a raw food diet but this is probably the next best thing. I also feed my girls canned food from the "Wilderness" line as a treat---they go absolutely CRAZY over it, especially my cat. They don't give that same reaction with grocery store brands. Also, this is kinda gross, but she very rarely leaves a gross litter box smell while on this food.<br />Please if you love your pets and want them to be healthy, try this food!!

review/summary: My pets are healthier and more active...
review/text: I love this brand.  I love that the ingredients written on the back are things that I would use in my own cooking and that this food is not just a bunch of crap filler, like other, less expensive brands.  My dog and cat eat Buffalo Blue and both their coats are shiny, they are active , and I don't have to worry about them not getting all the nutrients they need to make them feel their best.  I don't have any 2-legged kids yet, but I know that I would feed them as much all-natural/organic/clean food as I could, and I just feel it necessary to give my 4-legged kids the same kind of advantages :  The reps at Petsmart are the reason that I made a change from regular store-bought pet food to this brand.  They are very knowledgeable and able to thoroughly answer any questions I had for them whenever they are at the store.  I have also had to call the customer service # regarding my dog's food at one point a few years ago.  The food that I bought ended up being from a pallet that was not supposed to be shipped out b/c it wasn't as fresh as their QA deemed it should be.  When  I rec'd the bag, the food looked a little odd and my dog wasn't interested.  I called the customer service line and not only did they allow me to exchange the bag for another, but they sent me two $50 off coupons for future pet food purchases.  I really appreciated them doing what they could to make things right and that is why I will be a continued customer of theirs for years to come.

review/text: This is the best cat food that we've found.  While it is indeed more expensive than other brands, the quality is topnotch.  There is considerably less filler in this food so the cats eat less and as a result, there is less to scoop in the litter box!  Litter box odor has been greatly reduced as well, thanks to this food.<br /><br />Amazon has the best price around!

review/summary: Kitty Does Not Like
review/text: I hate to write a bad review for something, but after buying this product based on all the positive reviews, I have to share my experience.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I did not have the wonderful results that many of the other reviewers have described. I purchased Blue Buffalo after doing some research on my current food (Science Diet, Healthy Coat Formula) and deemed that it must be a superior product. I've heard that SD is full of fillers, byproducts and unhealthy whatnots. Everyone bragged how their cats loved Blue Buffalo and became much healthier, happier, and prettier. This was not the case with my 1 year old Calico, Olivia. Not only does she hate it, but her coat is noticeably less attractive and she is shedding probably 10 times more than she did on SD. She's also lost weight because she hasn't been eating as much. She is a very petite lady, so she doesn't need to lose any weight. She's hungry, because come feeding time (twice daily) she runs up eagerly awaiting to be fed, but when she sees that it is not her "brand" she sticks her nose up at it. Granted I wasn't expecting miracles, but this has been a bit of a disappointment. I guess it's just not for every kitty.<br /><br />I'm not saying you should go out and buy SD, that is not the purpose of this review, but I do want you to hear another side of this before you buy a large bag of BB.

review/summary: One of my 4 Cats ended up with a UTI
review/text: I have used Science Diet for almost 20 yrs. I started seeing bad reviews about it. The cornmeal, meat bi-products, etc... So I researched cat food and came across Blue Buffalo. It seemed to be a great food for my cats. So I slowly switched my cats from Science Diet to Blue Buffalo. One of my four cats is now taking meds to get rid of his UTI. He's 7 yrs old and has never had one before. I can't say for sure it's caused by the Blue Buffalo but the vet told us to be safe and switch back to Science Diet. Truth is, not sure why I switched in the first place, my one Persian lived 19 1/2 yrs on Science Diet. My other three cats seem to LOVE Blue Buffalo, more so than the Science Diet. But to be safe I have to switch back. So if you decide to try Blue Buffalo, just keep an eye on your cat(s) and make sure they don't start licking themselves a lot or peeing in places they aren't supposed to.

review/summary: Hype.
review/text: After reading the ingredients, I was not happy. I expected truly healthy ingredients, as with Newman's Own products. It's been a while, so I can't recall exactly what led me to believe the contents of the bag were not much better than most other commercial pet food. If I believed it were a healthier option for my 6 cats, I would have continued to spend the 35 bucks a bag. By-product, meal, and added vitamins turn me off. I will continue to feed my cats IAMS (which is not really better, in my opinion, just 13 bucks less expensive) because they always want food available to them as I search for a reasonably priced and truly healthy food. I only feed my dog Newman's Own treats and food that I prepare myself. Sorry BB, I'll pass forever.

review/text: I purchased this spice to use in a red lentil soup recipe and could not find it in Philadelphia.  The vendor was great the spice is delicious.  I never used sumac before (it has a citrus like flavor) and now have grown so fond of it that I sprinkle it on steamed vegetables and it perks them up with few calories.  Since I have never used sumac before I cannot compare the quality of this to other vendors but I am so happy with this that I will not look for other vendors and will in the future order other things from Zamouri as well.

review/summary: Sumac Spice
review/text: Some people hear the word "sumac" and don't like it because they are thinking of poison sumac.  This is not poisonous by any means.  This comes from the middle east.  You typically put a few dashes on top of hummus for presentation.  It has a kind of sweet/citrus-y taste.  If you're interested in middle eastern food then you should invest in this spice!

review/summary: Sumac...
review/text: Sumac is a single spice not a mixture of different spices and majority comes in a black or very dark colour unlike this brand which is a lighter colour. It is used mainly in Persian dishes with rice and kabob. I use sumac in majority of my dishes since I love the taste and the smell of sumac so much. It is not hot at all. It is not sweet. It is a different spice but absolutely a necessity for me. Once in a while you will get a very small seed that you can not consume but that is the nature of this spice. Bravo.

review/text: I've seen this spice listed as as ingredient for a while and wanted to try it. However, it's pretty scarce here in New England. Now I find many more uses for it beside Middle Eastern cuisine. With it's citrusy, tart taste, I can substitute it for many places that call for citrus zest. Sumac is now a permanent part of my spice rack!

review/summary: First Cup in the Morning is now Iced.
review/text: I grew up with "Folgers in my cup" as the company line goes, but it was so true. My parents purchased Folgers regular grind coffee and brewed a big pot every morning.  The next morning, my dad would drink the left over cold coffee while he waited for the new pot to brew.<br /><br />In today's fast paced world, I seldom have time to wait for a pot of coffee to brew so I tried instant coffees.  Folgers tasted like that brewed coffee I grew up on but without all the wait.  And I discovered something extra, when I put the crystals in 1/4th as much hot water and then add ice, I have the best Iced Coffee. It actually tastes, like fresh brewed coffee smells.
