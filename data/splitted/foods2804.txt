review/summary: its simply great!!
review/text: I am embarking on changing my diet for the better,  since diabetes runs rampant in my family. Walden Farms is a major help. I have read some of the reviews of this product and am skeptical. Assuming all of us has had regular ketchup since birth, anything outside of that realm will taste different especially when there is no calories, carbs, or sugars. This product is a excellent substitute, I put this on my tofu scramble or potatoes. It has a consistency of thick hot sauce, and it is runnier than regular ketchup. Before this, I was using reduced sugar heinz ketchup and I hated that when I first got that brand but I eventually got used to it. I suggest you at least use half the bottle before you decide you don't like it or won't incorporate it into your lifestyle. Highly recommended product! Can't wait to try the mayo!

review/summary: Promptly threw it in the trash!
review/text: I was excited to find this, as I normally eat the low sugar brand ketchup and am doing a low-carb diet. But... after gagging and washing my mouth out... I THREW IT IN THE TRASH and never looked back. If you want ketchup, I suggest getting the low sugar kind. Or just go cold turkey. Mustard, hot sauce and mayonaise are all carb-free options for sauces or ranch (which is low-carb). I really wish this was a better product. I love their BBQ sauce!

review/summary: Walden Farms Calorie Free Ketchup
review/text: Just bought this product at Mother's Market here in Irvine and was excited to find a no sugar ketchup.  However, the product is like tomato juice and it has no taste whatsover.  Ketchup has to be thick at a  minimum and have a taste of fresh tomatoes.  Don't waste $5.00 on this product.

review/summary: Don't Buy
review/text: I ordered 4 boxes of these orange candy sticks for my own personal use. Not for resale. Out of the 4 boxes 2 were in perfect condition and were orange flavor like I had ordered. One of the boxes was taped shut instead of shrink wrapped and the orange candy had obviously been in the heat for an extended period of time. All of the sticks are stuck tight to their wrappers and are a mess to try to eat. I just got to the 4th box and much to my dismay it turned out to be clove flavored. I am not among those who like cloves, the smell or I'm sure taste. Needless to say I just threw them out instead of the hassle of returning them. I would never buy from this seller again.  Amazon yes, this seller NO!

review/summary: Good for non tea drinkers too
review/text: I was looking for a drink mix I could keep on hand to add to my 24 oz water bottle that was mildly flavored and didn't taste like chemicals.<br />I don't care for the flavor of tea, so I was skeptical at first, but the tea flavor is quite mild and not very noticeable.  Now, I'm hooked!  I have little packets stashed everywhere.<br /><br />I don't use the recommended ratio of water to mix, so I'm drinking a watered down version of the product, but it's still very flavorful and helps me to drink at least a gallon of water a day.<br /><br />I really like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WEFSAI">Ocean Spray On the Go Sugar Free Drink Mix, White Cran-Peach, 10-Count Sticks (Pack of 12)</a> too, which is a bit sweeter.  Since I use 4-5 packets a day, I feel better drinking the AriZona Pomegranate Tea, because it's made with Splenda and I've come to prefer the milder taste.

review/text: There are lots of instant, flavored beverage powers out there, some green tea, some not.  Arizona instant green tea is the only-tea based instant now that I can find that does not use Aspartame.  (I used to buy Lipton instant flavored teas.)  When I check others (e.g. Crystal Light, Lipton), they all seem to be using Aspartame, which means I will pass.<br />I've been drinking this for years; I love it!

review/summary: A healthier, earth-friendly, 25 cent way to kick the Diet Coke habit!
review/text: I've been drinking 20 ounce diet sodas with lunch at work for years now. Recently, the prices got cranked up from $1.00 per bottle to $1.25. Combine this with recent reports that the phosphoric acid in diet drinks can rot your teeth, and I knew it was time for a change.<br /><br />My wife likes to buy the 50 pound pallet of Diet Snapple from Costco, but that costs and weighs too much and takes up too much space. Plus, you're paying for all of that packaging, which isn't very earth-friendly. Powder stix change all that. I have them shipped directly to my desk at work and re-use my 24 ounce shaker bottle each time. The cost is a mere 25 cents per serving when you buy 60 here at Amazon.<br /><br />But how's the product, you ask? It's delicious and it makes me feel good that I'm enjoying the benefits of green tea. How much, I don't know, but I know it's way better than soda. Bye bye, soda!

review/summary: Taste vs Goals
review/text: While I agree the taste isn't the greatest, neither is the fat on a body. This is not a product I would recommend switching to if you were simply looking for a jello pudding alternative. You will shock your taste buds! The product is geared for bodybuilders or people used to protein supplements.<br /><br />Another problem is almost as soon as the powder and water merge, it begins to congeal, making it difficult to scrape out of the blender or off the mixer paddles. In other words, you lose a lot of the pudding. However, the powder mix is cheaper than the can contained (premixed) protein puddings I have seen.<br /><br />As far as nutritional value, it is a worthwhile product. (145 cal, 3g fat, 4g carbs, 25g protein) The sodium is a bit high at 550 mg per serving. I usually have one serving if I find my protein is a bit short for the day, so it is not a staple in my diet. I don't think I would be able to eat one every meal or day! I'm leaning more toward obtaining an unflavored protein powder for my low protein days and eat the pudding only once a month or so.

review/summary: Best store bought coffee
review/text: When I'm not roasting my own beans, this is my go to coffee. Complex flavors abound with a nice rounded out smooth finish. Gives you a nice antioxidant boost, that I swear you can feel, to go along with the caffeine surge. I recommend brewing this with an extra scoop (or two) & some good quality mineral or spring water. Why ruin a great pot of coffee with tap water (which is no good for you anyways)?

review/summary: The jury is still out....
review/text: Was recommended this product by my acupuncturist to help with sleep and to keep the body 'regular.' Been taking Natural Calm Plus Calcium for 3 nights now. I am a small person, so only started with a half a teaspoon. I put it in Decaf Green Tea and take it before bed. It tastes fine, a little sweet. Now it's Day 3, and I don't know if this is one of those products that require 8 hours of sleep, but I feel foggy and exhausted, and have that 'sleeping pill' feeling, like I took a sleep aid but didn't sleep enough. (I sleep about 7 hours a night.) It's really not pleasant.<br />Am willing to try it some more, and will also be trying just the 'plain' Calm without the Calcium, Potassium, and Boron. Maybe those are messing with my head, not sure. Yesterday afternoon I was feeling funny, nauseous and also foggy in the head. I will say that I am sleeping more soundly at night, but to wake up feeling this groggy, and to have it last well into the morning is not fun. I will be testing more, but it seems to be doing funny things to me.

review/text: I had been waking up with cramps in my feet and calves.  I only used one scoop in my juice once a day and this product stopped the cramps within a couple days.<br /><br />I recently ran out of the Natural Calm and started using Source Naturals Magnesium Malate (I had bought both products so I could compare the two).  Within a week the cramps are back.  I also have been getting restless legs at night, which I had forgotten about when I was taking the Natural Calm.  I'm ordering more Natural Calm now.

review/summary: Fibromyalgia
review/text: I had been enduring an agonizing week-long episode of what appears to be a fibromyalgic Tetany Syndrome of excruciating pain radiating from hip-joint to knee-joint along the muscles between the joints. In trying to describe to myself the electro-convulsive nature of it, I said it appeared to be like a fibrillation - only deep in my hip, and immediately the word "magnesium" popped into my mind. Dunno why.<br /><br />Tottered out to kitchen and One teaspoon of Natural Calm and 20 minutes later the convulsive constant spasms stopped. I was free from pain and able to sleep. Have had to keep a steady repeated dosage to keep the spasms at bay and it is difficult to admit that I probably have Fibromyalgia, but thank God for a remedy to the pain.<br /><br />I've kept the Natural Calm in my cupboard because of a peculiar muscle flutter/twitch I would get around the eyes when magnesium levels were low. Know this is just an anecdotal tale, but screaming pain one moment and no pain 20 minutes later, only difference being the magnesium is a tale that needs to be told.

review/summary: Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon magnesium is good for regularity
review/text: I purchased Natural Vitality's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE">Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon 16 oz</a> as a magnesium supplement to help me absorb calcium better because I was diagnosed with osteopenia--precursor to osteoporosis.  I will have to wait until my next bone density test in about a year and a half to find out if adding this readily absorbed magnesium product has helped my bones.  In the mean time, however, it has helped with my chronic constipation.  I had been using stool softeners for the past couple of years and this works much better.  It is a powder which you mix in a cup of hot water and stir.  I usually take 5 grams (a heaping teaspoon) once a day.  After it is dissolved, I add a little cold water so I can drink it quickly, although it does taste good.

review/text: I don't usually leave product reviews, but this stuff is worthy of doing so.  I have taken magnesium supplements in various forms in hopes that they would help me get to sleep and stay asleep.  Natural Calm is the only supplement that has helped with my insomnia.  Every evening, I have a mug with a heaping teaspoon of Natural Calm in some water.  It really does help with my ability to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep all night.  I used to lie in bed and wait to fall asleep, sometimes for hours.  Now I can't even remember trying to get to sleep.  This product is wonderful!

review/summary: Good, but FAR TOO SWEET!!
review/text: I use this to calm my generally overactive system, deal with stress and sleep better, and it's not unpleasant. It's sweetened with Stevia, which I prefer to any other sweetener. One star off: it's horribly SWEET!! Most American-made sweet goods are sweet to such a degree that sometimes it's hard to detect any other taste, but even by those standards this stuff is incredibly oversweetened. I'll use it, but I wish there were another, less sweet and more natural flavor available. How about, say, mango or grape...?

review/text: I am disappointed to report that although this product did seem to have an effect on my anxiety the first time I took it, the second time I took it, it made me very nauseated. It may be the stevia; I am quite sensitive to artificial sweeteners (although I thought stevia was natural). At any rate, I am going to have to get rid of this product because I'd rather be anxious than vomiting. Call me crazy. If you are sensitive to non-sugar sweeteners, you may want to try a sample of this beforehand if you can find one before you shell out the money.

Calm helped to restore the balance and get me back on track, since I was kind of young for menopause. It has also taken my monthly cycle from 30-45 days right down to 28 days. It really is a great product. Magnesium is also wonderful for helping the body absorb calcium. I have been taking it for almost 8 months and I wouldn't think of stopping.

Not the kind of thing that knocks you out when you take it, but if you pay attention you can feel it.<br /><br />The great thing about the calcium is it is a great way to help sustain and maintain weight loss. This is the best flavor they offer no doubt about it.

review/summary: GREAT STOOL SOFTENER!
review/text: I do not get the calm relaxing better sleeping side effects from this. What I do get though is something that keeps my bowels regular. I take a medicine that causes heavy constipation, some users resort to taking laxatives every day which is addictive and dangerous. This is the best thing to clear you out and move things along. I've had two children and they send you home with a stool softener (Collace for me) and this works far better than collace. I started out about a week on just one large teaspoon. I was very bloated and backed up the entire time, it wasn't really doing much, then I upped to two large teaspons, without being graphic, it completely fixed my problem, although there were a few times if I hadn't been very close to a bathroom it could have resulted in a very traumatizing event. I don't think it tastes bad at all, I enjoy the warm drink in the evening, I put honey in mine, and use the natural one.

review/summary: LOVE this stuff!
review/text: Our chiropractor recommended Natural Calm for more muscle relaxation and deeper sleep - and my entire family takes it.  We've adjusted the dose for our 10 y/o downward (1/4 t. per day) and that's been better for him, but for my husband and me, the 1/2 t. dose is just right.  :)<br /><br />Our child has benefitted from it in that when he sleeps more deeply and doesn't wake easily, he has better days in lessons and is better able to focus.  That alone would make me re-purchase this product!  :)<br /><br />When we take it, we sleep better, more deeply, and if(when) we get up in the night to use the restroom, we don't struggle to fall back asleep - sleep is just *there*.  :)  I've also found that my "side stitches" - where the muscles at my ribcage contract and pull (it's uncomfortable) - go away when I take NC.  That's a beautiful side effect from taking it - and one I didn't expect.  My husband's infamous "Charley Horses" that wrack his legs with pain are virtually gone, too - and adding the NC has been the only change in his habits, so it's not like he's attributing the lack of cramps to anything else he's doing.<br /><br />I'm also a PCOS patient, which means I trend towards overproducing insulin.  With that, comes rough elbows and ridiculously dry skin - the NC has helped in that area as well.  My normal moisturizer doesn't touch my elbow-roughness, but the NC takes care of it on its own.  w00t!<br /><br />We like the lemon-raspberry flavour as well - it's like a hot lemonade in a mug.  :)<br /><br />All in all, we'll definitely be ordering more - I don't ever want to be without this supplement!

review/text: Before I  bought this I read all the reviews and they are all pretty accurate. It's a great product. I take 1.5 tsp twice a day once in the morning and once at night. It helped me sleep better, it made going to the bathroom easier, I wasn't craving junk food as much as usual (I'm usually pretty healthy about what I eat), and I just felt better in general. Great product I would give it 10 stars if I could!

review/summary: The cure for charlie horses!
review/text: I was looking for Mag Citrate in a fast-acting form that didn't taste terrible, and I found it in this product. I have a history of HypoMag including severe muscle spasms and prolonged charlie horses. I haven't had one charlie horse since starting on the mag...I am so thankful! Magnesium is a natural muscle relaxer and a vital mineral for bone and muscle health. I wish it was a little more affordable (because I have to use more of it than the average person) but I do plan to buy it again whenever possible.

review/summary: Great for kids to get their magnesium!
review/text: I can't write this review based off of continued use, as we just received it this week.  However, I wanted to say how glad I am that this product is available.  I have one child with asthma and another with autism.  Magnesium is suppose to benefit them both a lot, BUT getting children to take it is another story!  It's very sour and zingy, if that's a word, so the magnesium has taken a lot of coaxing to get them to take daily.  So I find this product of Peter Gillham's, and I'm so happy.  The kids say it tastes like warm sweet lemonade, and down it goes like a treat.  Also, very comforting to take just before going to bed.  Yeah!

review/text: As a sports referee for Basketball and Lacrosse, I do a lot of running, stopping, changing directions in an instance. This takes a toll on bones, muscles and joints. I usually feel the pain the next day after officiating these two sports. I've been using Calm for approximately four weeks and since I've started I have no soreness, my joints and bones feel good and my muscles are very relaxed. It does have a "good" effect on your bowel movement, it's not a bad thing, it keeps you cleansed. I would highly recommend this for any with muscle, joint or bone pain.

review/text: I bought the "natural" flavor, assuming it would be flavorless.  WRONG!  I bought it with the intention of adding it to my morning protein shake but it has a somewhat bitter citrus-y flavor that doesn't work in the shake.  I guess I need to try it just in water and see if I can tolerate it that way.  It's probably a great product/supplement but I'm having trouble getting past the taste.  Probably would have been better to get a flavored variety.

So...you need to experiment with how much you need/can take comfortably. I call it my cheese to magnesium ratio! It is a great product and I use it a lot...just with care. One rounded teaspoon in very warm water before bed seems to be " my level". Great product and service.
