review/summary: They changed the recipe! No longer tasty
review/text: But it's just as well as they aren't good for you.<br />But I sure used to love them. They used to have a delicious taste and texture. They used to be really oily. When you bit them they had a unique crystally magic crunch texture. When you bit it it came apart in flaky layers.<br /><br />Today when I bought one I was worried as the package was different. Also on the inside I knew it was different because the old bars used to be surrounded by a wax cardboard liner on 3 sides, now the new one had it only on the bottom. I could see that the new bar did not have chocolate swirls even though it was marble. The old ones you could clearly see chocolate swirls.<br />The new one: first bite, dry, no velvet crystal crunch texture, no tearing off and leaving flaky layers extending. It was not oily. AND WORST OF ALL: IT HAD NO FLAVOR! AND EVEN WORSE: IT HAS A SOUR RANCID TASTE AND THERE IS NO DATE ON PAKCAGE. SHAME ON YOU JOYVA FOR CHANGING THE RECIPE. MORONS

review/summary: Joyva Marble Halvah, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)
review/text: I highly recommend this Halvah!  It tastes identical to the Halvah that I used to eat when I was a kid, the Halvah with the picture of the Camel on the can that my mom used to purchase in German delicatessens. This marble Halvah is moist, tasty, perfect texture, and just enough chocolate in the marble to satisfy the chocolate lover.  Since I have deprived myself of Halvah over the years because the bars are so expensive to buy in health stores, I find myself totally indulging now. I must not overdo it since it does have sugar in it. Buy the three pack, best deal, huge savings over buying it in the stores, if you can find it in stores that is.  In the past two months I have ordered 3 shipments, that is 9 cans, have given two away, and have one can left.  I must I really like the stuff!  Buy it, you won't regret it.  Nice to know that it comes from New York, and not some foreign country. Amazon price is as great as is the free super saver speedy shipping.

review/text: This product is excellent. My dad bought this quite regularly, back in NY, during the 1950s. I thoroughly enjoyed it as a child, but had not tried it during a long career with the US Army. A few years ago, I had the pleasure of obtaining the same product; it brought back some very fond memories. I had forgotten just how good Joyva Halvah actually was. For several years I could buy it at the military Commissary or Harris Teeter. They have stopped carrying it, but thanks to Amazon, I can still enjoy this special treat here in North Carolina. Thanks Amazon, for providing an outlet for my special cravings.

review/text: I have tried several other brands of Halvah and always keep coming back to Joyva. Joyva has been around a very long time because my father used to buy it when I was a child. This particular halva is made with sesame seeds. It isn't greasy or oily like some halvahs. Some other halvahs are overly sweet. This is not. It only has 16 g of carbs per serving. Also has 2 g of fiber. It truly is a delicious and satisfying treat. They also have a chocolate covered sticks which are very good. But this one is my and my family's favorite.

review/summary: Really has a bite!
review/text: Just received our 5-lb. bag and my husband and I both love this soft and chewy product from Angelina's Gourmet Foods. We keep crystallized ginger in a sugar bowl on our table for "dessert" and/or to aid digestion. Although not labeled as such, I'm guessing this ginger is from Thailand, as most of the Australian ginger we've tried is very mild and often flavorless; not so with this one. It is spicy and hot and is what I expect from ginger; I don't have to eat a bunch to know what I'm tasting! I also chop it fine and add it to several recipes, including biscotti. We'll definitely order this again.

review/text: This has an excellent ginger tang, is chewable without either too much fiber or gumdrop stickiness.  The Amazon description mentions sulfur dioxide; I'm usually sensitive to that, but if it's actually in there I didn't notice it.  The 5-pounds came in one nonresealable bag; I simply transferred the slices to two zip bags for convenience in use and storage.

review/text: We've tried a variety of crysallized ginger and find this to be a good, consistent quality at a quite reasonable price.  The individual pieces are sliced lengthwise or on the bias and are not the little 'coins' you get with some other gingers but, for the most part, are tasty and smooth.  There is an occasional stringy piece but not a lot.  Keep in mind that this ginger has a bit of a bite, so be prepared.  Shipping is prompt.

review/summary: Sometimes really bad
review/text: I regularly order this product and it is normally as described by other reviewers, tender, moist, sweet. Occasionally, it seems to be distributed by another company and in those cases the quality is poor. The ginger is darker, dry, bitter, and tough. Lack of consistency of this product is unfortunate because when it is good, it is really good. When it is bad, it is a waste of money because you can't return it.

review/text: I really enjoy candied Ginger.  It not only tastes great, but it noticeably helps with nausea and is supposed to be great for digestion.  This brand is especially excellent.  I have tried a few different brands off of Amazon and not all were so good.  This one has a perfect blend of sweet and that ginger 'bite.'  Klein's 10 oz. tubs I thought were too sweet, but I did eat it all eventually.  Reed's 3.5 oz bags and Roland's 6lb can I just can't eat.  They're way too much - super strong and - just very different from Angelina's.  It may work for baking, but I don't cook with ginger generally.  This ginger from Angelina's is so good I've bought it 3 times now because of the taste and because of how it helps with nausea.  I also enjoyed the stuff from sweet gourmet (16oz).

review/text: WOW, this stuff is so fun!!!  If you are a fan of ginger, this is the product for you.  Ginger is supposed to be great for digestion, but it's also quite delicious.  This particular product seems to be the spiciest crystallized ginger I've ever eaten.  It's extra soft, and seems fresher than when I buy it at the grocery store.  And the kicker?  When I last bought this product at the grocery store, the unit price was around 12 dollars per pound.  Since this seller lists their ginger on amazon for less than 5 dollars per pound, it's a no brainer for me.  This is the best bulk deal I've found, and of course it's on Amazon.  That's why I'm the ultimate amazon Fun Boi.  Amazon so fun, ginger so delicious, blood pumps faster and stronger, excitement unending!!!  I'm moaning while I chomp my teeth and gums and lips, and suck on this ginger.  Scrumptious and overwhelming, the flavor makes my eyes tear with emotion.  I'll never get enough, ginger keeps my heart beating.  Thank you ginger!!!

To spend money for a five pound bag, not knowing whether I'd find it to my liking or not, was a slight gamble that I took.  And I am glad I did.  Candied or not I want that "Zing" in ginger and these bites have it.  If you like sweet and mild ginger candy, this is not for you.  Here the ginger flavor comes out nice and strong.  A great tummy-settler after a heavy meal or extensive munching on brownies.

I prefer this Nestea with hot water from my tea kettle. Convience is such a key with my time.<br />- I have had this tea with just the lemon and it is as good as this one with the lemonade added. I like my tea stonger which it can be tart. I like the WOW feeling from this tea. Everyone has to try it.<br />- Make sure to watch the caffiene and shake the container once in a while to get the mix just right. I substitute my coffee also with this tea. I always make sure I have this in my kitchen.

review/text: I had ordered this for my younger sister and I. We grew up with my mother using it to flavor green beans. We have been searching for this product for at least 25 years so I was so excited when I found it here. I absolutely loved this on popcorn along with some cheddar cheese seasoning. When I am the only one home at dinner time this will be my "meal." I sure hope it becomes available again through Amazon. I am sure that cooks can come up with a lot of great uses for this wonderful product. It is also great to "jazz" up soups with.

review/summary: Savory bacon-y deliciousness
review/text: You wouldn't believe how much of a bacon-y flavor this gives to whatever you sprinkle it on. OK well truth be told I've been vegan for 14 or so years so if you are a true bacon lover I can't say how it would fare. But I really didn't expect it to taste as good as it did, it truly lends a super yummy smokey taste to any food. I love it on baked potatoes with homemade bean 'cheeze', on top of soups, toast, chili, you name it. I can't say enough about how good it tastes.

review/summary: So So Coffee
review/text: I have been looking for a less expensive Costarican Tarrazu coffee.  So when I found this coffee I had high hopes for it because the price seemed to be pretty reasonable compared to what I have been buying.  Of course rating food items can be pretty subjective.  So with that said; all I can say is that this is a decent coffee but it doesn't quite measure up to the rich flavor I was expecting.  The beans seem kind of dry and are lacking the glossy oily finish you get from most high quality coffees.

review/text: For those wondering about the flavor of this gum I would describe it as being very similar to cinnamon with kind of a musky floral scent. It isn't unpleasant. however it isn't sugar free which is preferable for most kinds of gum now. The actual gum is very hard and loses flavor quickly, not recommended for those with sensitive teeth.<br /><br />Overall I like it, but it is different.

review/text: I order these olives on a regular basis and I think they are great.  I keep them in the refrigerator and  then dump them into a Tupperware bowl and spoon them out as a snack between meals.  Olives are  one of the oldest food sources on the planet and I guess it's all a matter of taste but I think these are delicious.  I think they come from the Middle East, most likely Israel, and they are a bit different than what we are used to but they make for a variety in taste.

review/summary: Such healthy dogs...
review/text: I discovered this brand in July 2007.  My two terriers were always prone to digestive problems - gas, vomiting, diahrhea.  They both had asthma, allergies and chronic ear infections.  My vet told me that is just how the breed is and I spent thousands of dollars on vet treatments.  I felt so sad for my dogs, I began exploring health options on my own.  After much research, I found that nutrition can cause and cure many health ailments, including all those my dogs had.<br /><br />I researched a variety of brands, and began buying Wellness Lite - within a few weeks, my dogs were both healthier than ever.  It has now been 10 months and we've had no more health problems whatsoever - my only regret is that I did not find this brand sooner!

review/summary: Seems better for the owner rather than the dog
review/text: We recently adopted an obese pet and were looking for healthy dog food that could help him lose weight. The ingredients seemed great, but this food made our dog vomit daily and have very soft bowel movements 5-7 times per day! The food did little to help with weight reduction (even with all the vomiting), and we eventually had to switch to a veterinarian-prescribed food instead. (Note: Our dog does not have a hypothyroid problem.) After we stopped feeding our dog this brand of dog food, his stool has become firmer and less frequent, and he is no longer vomiting on a daily basis.<br /><br />As I stated above, the ingredients seemed very healthy and nutritious, but I would not feed this to my dog or recommend it to anyone else.

We also have to watch the 3 1/2 year old because she has pancreatitis and a low fat food is good for her so that she keeps an even weight.  We tried many different dog foods including premium holistic foods and prescription foods.  We have used the Wellness Super5Mix Healthy Weight food for about 2 months.  So far, both of them seem to be doing well.  They like it well enough that we use the dry kibbles for their treats.  I will update the review in another few months.

review/summary: Awesom Price, Awesome Project!
review/text: So glad I could find this on Amazon. Saved more than $10.00 off of regular retail price at all of my local pet stores. My dog has been sick, in part due to regular name-brand dry foods. Too many additives and by-products hidden behind a "healthy" label. Wellness allows me to feed my dog food that will not make her sick. I can pronounce the ingredients and she loves the Healthy Weight Recipe, despite it being a "diet" formula. As a dog living with colitis, limiting fat and increasing fiber intake is vital to her IT health. This food makes it easy and she still regards it as a treat six months after starting to eat it in her bowl. She is a finicky eater, and I have spent hundreds of dollars on various "diet" foods from the vet and pet boutiques. This was the first formula she liked right out of the bag. What a relief! Five star product!

review/summary: Excellent food with an easy-to-read nutrition label
review/text: Our 7�-year-old and 2-year-old dogs have been on Wellness Super5Mix Healthy Weight Recipe Dog Food for almost 3 weeks at the time of this review. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the bag for the first time -- I was not greeted by that all-too-familiar and cringe-worthy dry food smell that you get from other brands. The kibbles are little triangles and pale yellow in color. I love that the 26-lb bag is also resealable.<br /><br />Because this food was designed to fill doggy bellies the right way, I learned quickly that I didn't need to adhere to typical portion sizes for our dogs. The 7�-year-old is a 92-lb Rott/Shep. Given her size, the recommendation is 4 cups a day. This serving size is not needed in our case with this food. She eats 2� cups at dinnertime and is very happy. She doesn't poke around the food bag or tip her bowl over as a request for more. Our 2-year-old is a 40-lb Chow mix that is as skinny as her breed comes. She eats 1� cups (sometimes less) and walks away when she's done, occasionally leaving a few kibbles for her sister to finish up.<br /><br />Both dogs have also not skipped any meals the way they used to when they were on a different brand of food. They now eat every evening without fail, and I've not had to throw out uneaten kibbles. I also recently noticed that their breaths actually smell cleaner.<br /><br />Thank you, Wellness, for making excellent products for our furry kids!

review/text: If you have never investigated what is in your dogs food, and you think it is all about the same...READ THIS !<br />All dry dog food is NOT good for your loved pet, and it is NOT the same.  MANY major brands of dog food, including most that are sold at local grocery stores are not good for your pet.  Yes...they will survive on them...and yes...they might like the taste, but investigate !  Useless calories, fillers of cereal husks, and other trash are typical ingredients....and....the PRIMARY incredients.  Wellness...and some other brands....all of which will cost you more than the cheap brands, are made with chicken, lamb, or other animal products as their MAIN incredient, which will be the FIRST one listed on the label, by law.  With added antioxidents, vitamins, and joint compounds, these premium foods will extend the life of your pet.  Feeding them the cheap food is like feed your child McDolnald's bugers 3 times a day, with all the desserts they can eat.  They will live, but you are killing them slowly.  Our dig loves her Wellness food, and I feel better knowing I am doing the best I can for her.  Does you dog deserve any less?

So we switched to the Healthy Weight formula and she transitioned very well.  And it cured the gas and breath problems too.  Although she is at a good weight, we will continue with this formula because she really likes it and since I use individual kibble as a treat for good behavior, I don't worry that she is getting over fed.  I would highly recommend this formula, regardless of whether your dog has a weight problem or not.

review/text: Our puggle's weight had ballooned to almost 40 pounds--at least 10 pounds too heavy--and we weren't willing to feed her a low-quality food full of by-products and weird stuff after making the switch to holistic foods a few years ago. Just three months after starting on Wellness Healthy Weight, she has shed several pounds and is well on her way to being at her ideal weight again. Our other, healthy-weight dog has also been eating this food without any noticeable weight gain or loss and without having any food allergy flare-ups. The best part is that both dogs love the food, and they are both picky, picky eaters. If you're looking for a high-quality, no-filler holistic food to help your lazy, treat-filled pooch lose some of those extra pounds, give this one a try.

When I was working and leaving her at home she was occasionally required to "hold it" for 10-12 hours (not good, I know).

As she is aging (8 years old this month) I see no reason to stop....an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  I buy 2 at a time...I never want to run out!

review/text: My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy.  Because he eats it heartily, I don't worry that he's getting enough high quality food.  Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.<br /><br />There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills. A definite cost effective WIN:WIN for doggie AND me.<br /><br />I've had great results with Newman's Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon BUT there's 5 pounds LESS for about the same price.<br /><br />Psst I'm not an organic fanatic, it's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids!<br /><br />Update 3/26/2011: Noticed this has jumped to almost THIRTY BUCKS, will opt for Newman's Organic when the costs per pound are the same...my dog likes BOTH Harmony and Newman, my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase :)<br /><br />Update 5/17/2012: Last batch Of Harmony Farms I ordered had a rancid oil smell when I opened the bag and the pooch wouldn't eat it as readily as he has in the past. He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash. I subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods, cooked brown rice etc as mix-ins to "encourage" him to make it through this pricey bag. Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly. I probably should have called Customer Service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the HOT weather here. Definitely exploring hot weather alternatives.

review/summary: This is great dog food!
review/text: A few years back, prompted by the death of one of our dogs due to an inoperable brain tumor, I switched my dogs to foods without corn.  I was convinced, right or wrong, that my animal died needlessly because of an over usage of steriods prescribed to cure her constant ear infections.  I believe, again right or wrong, that the recurring ear infections were caused by an allergy to corn...which turned out to be the main ingredient in her food!  Sorry, I'll get off my soapbox and address the issue at hand...I found this food by accident.  The only type the store had was the weight loss formula.  Turns out my dogs love it!  I haven't seen them so spunky and full of energy.  I've got a coon hound and two jack russells (mine are not the "bounce off the wall kind", mine are mellow, laid back kinda dudes!)  They gobble this stuff up and seem to stay full...no more begging in the kitchen than normal! Everyone's skin seems smoother, eyes are brighter, heck, I think I'll go have a bowl!  All I can say, is if you are looking for a good quality dog food, this is the one for you.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!

review/summary: I would give Harmony Farms extra stars if I could!
review/text: I have a 2 year old Portuguese Water Dog who always seemed to have a sensitive stomach, and a 15 year old Shepherd X dog who was beginning to lose weight, she slept almost all the time, and she was getting very fussy about what she'd eat. (I believe that with a dogs sense of smell they KNOW exactly what is in their food; however they have no choice but to eat what we feed them...just Google what is in most commercial dog foods, and you'll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it up...if a dog can detect cancer in a person, they can detect all sorts of other things that aren't supposed to be eaten.) Anyway...I used to feed Purina lamb and rice to my dogs, but I was finding my young Porty was having trouble with it, and my 15 yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish. So, I started making their food, and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe. The dogs loved my homemade dog food, and my 15 yr old began putting on weight again, but I didn't always have time to make their food. And, homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet. So, I started to research all the natural dog foods out there, compare costs etc. I arrived on Harmony Farms, and guess what...my dogs LOVE it just as much as they love my home made dog food. My young Porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great; my 15 yr old finishes her meals and looks for more. Both have shiny coats and energy. No one can believe my old girl is 15 years old. I have told my friends about Harmony Farms dog food, and when they've switched over, they've reported similar positive results. My brother-in-law's dog had always been a very fussy eater, and had skin problems with a thinning coat. When they started to feed her Harmony Farms, she became an eager eater, more happy and outgoing, and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up (...I'm thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food, which I think was Iams). Other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now...and they had all been feeding their dogs premium, top of the line dogs foods AND paying top of the line prices. Harmony Farms products are very reasonably priced. Not the cheapest dog food on the shelf, but, in my opinion, you are buying the best quality food on the market, so it's an incredibly GOOD DEAL! It may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarian's office. I and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs. :)

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: My co-worker that does animal rescue brought in a 'Whole Dog Journal' recently and I was astounded at the feature article for that month which covered dog foods, I had been feeding my dog Beneful which is basically just junk food.  I switched her off immediately, hunted around on Amazon to find an all natural food and this fit the bill, shipping was free which was awesome and my dog LOVES the food, I worried about that b/c I've switched her before and she's been uninterested and I've had to top with gravy, etc.<br /><br />Do your research, it will blow your mind what your pets are eating in regular grocery store dog food, it's typically a high ratio of corn which is a filler.  If you want your pet to live a long and healthy life what they're ingesting should be high up on your list.  I'm glad to have the knowledge now and I really wish I'd looked more into this with my two other dogs years and years ago.

review/summary: Quality dog food delivered to your door!
review/text: No more heavy grocery bags for me -- I've just ordered my first bag of Harmony Farms dog food -- and it was delivered to my door by UPS.  The food is excellent quality -- I bought this product based on its healthy ingredients; the dogs love it and I love Amazon for making it so easy to buy!<br /><br />July 2010 - one of my dogs has had bouts of inflammatory bowel disease:  previously she had to have special food from my vet (Royal Canaan Duck & Potato for the past 4+years) -- She has tolerated, even thrived on, the Harmony Farms food w/o any problems. Each bag of Harmony Farms is about $20 cheaper than the Royal Canaan.  Hard to fight.  I am a believer.<br /><br />The canned food is great, too.<br /><br />September 2011 -- my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past (verified by surgery) has never felt better -- she is a wire and has the energy of a 2 yr old dog (she is 7); she is not on any daily medication.  This HEALTHY WEIGHT FORMULA has helped her to thrive.  Enough protein, not too much fat seem to do the trick. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Didn't do well for my dog
review/text: I was giving my shihtzu the Fromm Adult Gold dog food. She didn't seem to want to eat it though so I thought I would try something different. I found the Harmony Farms and thought I'd give it a try. She actually liked it. It's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her.

review/text: I was using Castor and Pollux from Amazon for my dog and I decided to try something different.  My dog dug into this dog food right away!  It has helped to maintain her rough coat so that it is softer and smoother.  And this food really helps keep her weight at a healthy level.<br /><br />I catch my cat sneaking over to my dog's food bowl and eating this food, too.  I have to look into getting her some Harmony Farms!  I can do this because Harmony Farms is really good quality food that is affordable.

review/summary: Passed the taste test!
review/text: Everyone should know this is a healthier dog food than walmart brands, like purina, iams, or god forbid moist & meaty. Ingredients like ground flax seed, peas, whole carrots, whole sweet potatoes, apples, blueberries and probiotics and the lack of sweeteners, by-products, and low-quality corn show this to be true.<br /><br />I just did a taste test with this harmonic farms and my dogs old iams ProActive Health and decided to make the results known. I let him smell both thoroughly without letting him eat at first, and placed the two piles a bit apart. He immediately went for the harmonic farms, finished it and didn't even look at the iams before coming back to me wagging his tail hoping for more.<br /><br />Dogadvisor.com made me aware of my past mistakes in dog food choices and I was hoping to god he would not shy away from the healthy organic stuff like I do. To my great welcome surprise, he didn't! I guess he's a hippie at heart. I on the other hand, will take my nachos bell grande.

review/summary: Excellent for Wheaten Terrier's Sensitive Tummies!
review/text: Harmony Farms produces EXCELLENT dog food products!  Our 8 month soft-coated wheaten terrier is sensitive to gluten, corn meal and other products generally found in the popular  brands.  We were preparing to take him to the vet at about 4 months old b/c he had great difficulty eliminating -- to the point of whining as he would attempt to go.  After more research on the breed we purchased Harmony Farms at a local store -- it was expensive but quickly resolved our puppy's digestive issues.  After 5-8 days on only Harmony Farms products our puppy was happy and healthy!<br /><br />I was so happy to find Harmony Farms on Amazon!  It is more economical AND delivered right to our door.  Our puppy, Connor, eats only Harmony Farms dog food and treats and is a much happier puppy now. Definitely recommend it for soft-coated wheaten terriers and other breeds that have difficulty digesting the popular brands.

review/text: Wish I would have known a long time ago what a difference this dog food makes. My 6 year old Jack Russell has always had the worst shedding problem and I recently read that excessive is a sign of poor nutrition (was feeding her P*urina dog chow). She's only been on this dog food for two weeks and I can noticeably tell a difference in the shedding! She loves the taste and I love the price for such a good quality dog food.

review/text: The main ingredients in this dog food are so much better than the ingredients in the common grocery store brands, and it tends to be less expensive than specialty brands.  My dog's coat looks shiny and he seems much healthier since we switched to this food about a year ago.  The other nice thing is that Target sells this brand, so if you ever find yourself at the end of the bag and you haven't ordered more in time, you can stop by Target.

review/summary: Both formulas are excellent for my dogs!
review/text: I have a nearly 1 year old golden retriever/standard poodle mix, and a 6 year old german shepherd. The doodle gets the chicken and  brown rice (just switched her a few weeks ago from Nutro Max) and the shepherd gets the healthy weight. I have tried several different foods for the doodle, and many of them caused problems like diarrhea and stinky, stinky farts. With this, while switching from the Nutro Max, she had none of those problems. In fact, I only took 5 days to switch her instead of 2 or so weeks, and she didn't have any digestive problems. Both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective... several dollars cheaper at my local Wegman's and there are always coupons in the paper. This is a very high quality food for the price, and I like that it's available at the grocery store as I live in a small town. I highly recommend this food and hope to feed it exclusively for as long as my doggies shall live!

review/text: I purchased this because of the good reviews and the great ingredients. No doubt about the quality of the food and my 5 month old dachuhund puppy loves it. But I realized this doesn't have DHA that helps to develop cognitive brain function. Also the kibble might be little big for a puppy. So I believe it's a great food for an adult dog, but I wouldn't recommend it for a puppy.

review/summary: The best food for dogs!
review/text: In my opinion, this is the best food for dogs.  My boyfriend is an avid researcher, and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts - taste (the dogs love it), health-wise (it has healthy fats, and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn) and digestion-wise (the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food).  We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.  Now they jump when it's dinner time!  Our dogs are happy, very healthy, have shiny coats, and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food.  We get it on Subscribe and Save and we usually go through 1 bag p/ month - for reference, we have one 15lb Bichon and one Alaskan husky.

review/summary: Solved 2 different digestive issues for 2 different dogs!
review/text: I have 2 husky/shepherd mixes. The first is 13 months and has a finicky stomach - if he eats too fast, drinks too fast, or eats anything out of his routine, he would bring it back up. He also wouldn't eat more than a few nibbles at a time. The 2nd is 7 months old and came to us with severe diarrhea (vet's food didn't fix it either). He would eat anything and everything if we let him. Within a day of both dogs being on Harmony Farms (No fasting, just a quick switch), both dogs digestive issues are gone. My oldest (the finicky eater) is healthily eating his meals without pause or hesitation. My youngest has solid, regular bathroom breaks and has been able to relax his water intake as a result. They're both more relaxed.<br />We purchase at our local grocery store (Hannaford here in NY) for about $1.31/lb. For the price, ingredients, and results - you can't beat it.

review/text: I ordered this as a thank you for my Mother who had been watching my dogs for me while i was out of town.  It showed up two days later, right on time.  She called to say thanks and that she had received it and to let me know how good it was and that she was really enjoying it.  Went to visit her the next weekend and tried some out.  Very good indeed.  there was nothing in the box that i thought was bad or mediocre.  Very good across the board. I would buy this again and most likely any product from Golden State Fruit.

review/text: Was delivered to a fruit starved soldier in Alaska in time for Christmas. Local produce is over priced and poor quality in the winter there.

review/summary: Great gift
review/text: I got this as a gift for my dad on fathers day.  He loves dried fruits and nuts and I was a bit short on other ideas so I got this in a pinch.  As always with Amazon prime, he got it very quickly (early even!).  He seemed really happy with it...a good variety with all his favorites and good quality to match.  I would definitely get it again or even get it for my own house for a party or something.

review/summary: mother's day gift
review/text: I sent this to my Mother on Mother Day. Flowers are nice but you can not eat them. This was a beautiful tray of dryed fruit and nuts. My mother called minutes after opening box to let me know how much she loved it.

review/summary: Excellent Product With Super-Fast Shipment!
review/text: I ordered this for my brother-n-law, who is a very picky person with higher than average standards for just about everything.  Basically, NOTHING is ever good enough, in his opinion.  Giving him a birthday gift is always a challenge but we do it anyway, expecting lackluster feedback from him.  Not this time!<br />This fruit & nut gift basket was a hit!  The exact words to describe the contents were "first class stuff!"<br />I was especially impressed with the fast shipping.  I didn't even pay for next day delivery, but the item was delivered less than 24 hours after I ordered it!  Now that is service!  I will definitely order from this company again!

review/summary: Have purchased this as a gift several times
review/text: I've purchased this item several times as gifts for family members. I try to send them healthy food gifts instead of the usual gift basket full of high fat, high sodium stuff. The recipients have all been pleased with this product. The dried fruit is good quality, and the nuts are tasty. There are even a couple of small coconut-covered date rolls, which make a nice treat.

review/summary: Recipients were pleased with this item!
review/text: I sent this item in lieu of flowers when my dad was hospitalized. (I refuse to pay upwards of $50 for a tiny bouquet in a plastic vase! Not gonna happen.) He loves dried fruits and nuts, and I figured he would appreciate this a heck of a lot more than looking at a useless, wilting bouquet of flowers on a nightstand. Both my mom and dad raved about it.  They said it was big, and that the fruit was tasty and fresh. This was a wonderful gift and I would purchase it again.
