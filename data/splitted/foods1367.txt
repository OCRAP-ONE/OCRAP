review/summary: Favorite dressing
review/text: This is my very favorite (and only) salad dressing but it's almost impossible to find in the stores (they only seem to carry the lowfat version, which has an after-taste to me).  So I love being able to order it online - it comes really quickly.  The only bad part is the shipping cost.

review/summary: over priced! this should be a two pound brick not a one
review/text: I like to make cheese dip with chili or salsa and eat with chips topped with smoked brisket with jalapenos. I do this when I have day off from work and drinking with friends. It's cheap and satisfying and something that I can get online that doesn't hurt my pocket. However, my local wall mart puts wolf chili no beans on sale ($1 to $1.30) every time it is cold. Velveeta two pound block is like 4 or 5 dollars and marked down at Super Bowl and holidays weekends. I would really give this a one star rating because I was expecting twice as much faux cheese. At this price I could get a decent cheddar and definitely a good Longhorn colby jack. Maybe since I am from Texas, which I would think would be a target market for Velveeta, it is cheaper here. I order online so on my day off I can cut down on chores and do important things like getting inebriated. So far i have been doing well ordering online but I do think that this price is doubling what I would pay at a store down the street. I don't really know why any one would order this unless they are like me. Maybe it is not available in your area or you are far from wall mart. I will stop rambling this is overpriced even with free shipping which is a shame since chips, salsa and jalapenos are all on this wonderful Amazon for good prices and free shipping. Start a protest and give this review a helpful rating. Thank you.

review/text: howdy y'all,<br /><br />as others have pointed out, this is NOT the standard package you see at the grocery stores. it's a ONE pound package and is quite a bit smaller than the one in the stores. still, it's pretty decent stuff that i like with crackers or chips. it's also definitely mild which i prefer since i can always ADD more spice when i want it and the reverse is ... not so easy. [*grin*]<br /><br />the price is a tad high, being almost the same cost as the large block in the local store. the TWO pound block at the store is about $3.80 while this item is $3.88 per ONE pound block.<br /><br />i've rated it a THREE cuz there is nothing special for or against it. i almost went with a TWO cuz of the double-the-local-store cost.<br /><br />there is one additional gotcha with this item. i live in texas and the blocks were round little tubes when they arrived! [*grin*] the summer heat during shipping melted them pretty completely. i put them in the fridge and the boxes slowly more-or-less squared the blocks back up.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee

review/text: W A R N I N G:  THIS IS DELICIOUS CHEESE, BUT, LIKE ALL CHEESE, SHOULD BE EATEN IN MODERATION.  IT IS N O T FOR THE LACTOSE-INTOLERANT, OF COURSE -- AND TOO MUCH CAN MAKE ONE FAT AND VERY THIRSTY!!!!!<br /><br />Velveeta Loaf Mexican Mild, 16-Ounce Loaves, (Pack of 6), arrived<br />soon after I had ordered it, in perfect condition!<br /><br />The taste is a bit spicier than regular Velveeta, but that is to<br />be expected, from the name of the item.  The extra spiciness is<br />perfect for making Mexican-style sandwiches, and spicing up any<br />recipe that calls for cheese.  As with regular Velveeta, there<br />are recipes printed inside the box -- three of them beneath the<br />box that I have first opened.<br /><br />Since this cheese, (a perishable item), and other cheeses, (also<br />perishable items), are happily available on Amazon, I would like<br />to suggest that the simple METHOD of preservation used in pack-<br />ing Velveeta cheese be used, whenever possible, to preserve<br />OTHER perishable items, (like more FROZEN FOOD, and perhaps even<br />the legendary, (but, presently on Amazon, HORRENDOUSLY expens-<br />ive) TUSCAN MILK!  (The great expense is now charged by 3rd<br />0arty sellers...not Amazon.  But if the Velveeta Cheese method<br />is used,  in the near future, maybe both these 3rd-party sellers,<br />and amazon itself, could sell this legendary milk at a lower<br />price?)  The method is simply............wrapping the Velveeta<br />cheese in ALUMINUM FOIL, SHINY SIDE OUT.  The non-shiny side of<br />the aluminum foil is presumably very slightly coated, (?), thus<br />not allowing full aluminum to touch the cheese -- as well as<br />allowing the aluminum on the outside to act as preservative.<br />Another way to prserve other perishables, (including THE legend-<br />ary Tuscan Milk!), would be to FREEZE all these perishables<br />until JUST before shipment!  I know, I know -- Velveeta Mexican<br />cheese uses Sorbic Acid as a prservative, (list of all ingredi-<br />ents given below) -- but milk, I have read, can be prserved.<br />not only by freezing, but by the addition of A FEW GRAINS OF<br />EXTRA SALT!  Just think of ALL the delicious frozen food, usu-<br />ally sold only in groceries, that could be sold here on Amazon<br />with just a few extra freezers in the basement of Amazon Head-<br />quarters, and a few grains of extra salt added into those<br />products for which it is convenient to so do!<br /><br />In the meantime, I'm going to use my Velveeta Loaf, Mexican<br />Mild to try to make home-made pizzas, and other creative, spicy<br />dishes!<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:  Milk, Whey, Whey Protein Concentrate, Milkfat,<br />Milk Protein Concientrate, Sodium Phosphate, Salt, Jalapeno<br />Peppers, Vinegar, Sorbic Acid as a preservative, Sodium Algin-<br />ate, Apocarotenol, (colour), Enzymes, Cheese Culture<br /><br />NOT the healthiest thing to eat, I know.  But it sure is<br />healthier than candy!  My mom has told me that, since I have<br />been a cheese-lover all my life, she gave me cheese as a child,<br />instead of candy, as it is obviously healthier than most, if<br />not all candies!  I think this is an excellent idea, if given<br />to children in moderation!  And cheese from Velveeta Mexican<br />Loaf is extra spicy and delicious!

review/summary: Favorite coffee since 1988
review/text: My wife and I lived in Germany in the late 1980s.  We love coffee and tried many 'local brands' until we finally found Prodomo.  We loved it immediately.  Since beginning to drink Prodomo, we have never 'gone back'!  On more than one occasion, we visited their primary shop in Munich (a truly amazing place that caters to everything gourmet!!)  When we first returned to the US, I was smuggling the coffee home on my frequent business trips or, when I wasn't going to Germany, we had friends of ours in Germany send the coffee to us.  FINALLY, it became available in the US.  We have hooked many people on this coffee.  Honestly, I have never had anyone not LOVE it!<br /><br />We still drink Dallmayr Prodomo every day - in fact, at least twice on most days.

review/text: I love this coffee! Great aroma, not acidy and very smooth. The taste depends on method of preparation. You need to grind the beans right before making coffee. My low end Krups espresso machine makes it taste a little bit bitter. Now I use the stove top to prepare it. It doesn't taste bitter at all even without sugar. You will never drink burned Starbucks coffee again after trying Dallmayr.

review/summary: Excellent, Distinctive, Cheap!
review/text: Coffee taste: Like a lot of reviewers I tried this when I was in Germany years ago. It has a very distinct flavor. Some people say it is very acidic, but I have a sensitive stomach and I would say just the opposite. It strikes me as low in acid. In any case, it has a very smooth taste. I use one-half the sugar in this coffee. I get amazing compliments on it from guests. But it DOES have a distinctive taste. If you like the Starbucks dark roast (which I don't) then you will likely be disappointed in this. But it you like a smoother flavor I would give it a try. My wife, who had this for the first time last month, was at first taken aback by its distinctive flavor but by the second cup she insisted that we switch to using this coffee exclusively rather than our usual mix of Gevalia, Organic Coffee Co., or occasionally Starbucks French Roast. All I can say is we love it and so do our guests.<br /><br />Second, as others have said, if you own a superautomatic espresso/coffee machine then this is an excellent low-oil bean that will help prevent grinder jams. We have a Gaggia and this works great. It also produces an outstanding crema coffee with a really nice golden head on it.<br /><br />Third, it is CHEAP. Look carefully at the packaging. It is a one-kilo package (two 500 gram bags). That is over 35.27 ounces or the equivalent of about 3 grocery store 12 ounce bags that usually cost $8.99 or so. So at the excellent Amazon price with free shipping (Prime) this is the equivalent of under $7 a bag. (Compare the price per ounce on Amazon this is 10-15 cents per ounce cheaper than the alternatives).<br /><br />What's not to love about this? Some of the best tasting and most distinctive coffee you can buy, does wonders for the working of your high-end espresso machine, and its is less expensive than the pedestrian 8 o'clock coffee etc. in the grocery stores.

review/summary: Best German coffee I've found on Amazon
review/text: I started drinking German coffee a few months ago because I read that it was easier on those of us with acid reflux. This is definitely true - I've been able to cut my antacid use in half.<br /><br />I like my coffee strong, but not dark and bitter. After trying several brands of coffee here on Amazon, I've decided I like this one the best. It is strong and full-flavored with a normal amount of coffee in the percolator. Having beans to grind so it's really fresh is an added bonus. Subscribe and save makes it even better!

review/text: I don't agree with the reviewer who wrote that this coffee is nasty.  I have been drinking Dallmyer prodomo (which means "household" or "everyday") for two years and I think it is one of the best, right up there with Illy, and better than other German and Italian coffees offered by Amazon.  It isn't dark enough for espresso but makes a great cup in a drip coffee maker.  Very flavorful!  Amazon stopped distribution for awhile, but I'm glad it is available again.  Pound for pound, it is irreplaceable for the price.

I use this to put on our dogs food, but the pump tends to deliver a lot of air so it's difficult to measure based on the number of pumps. Also, after using it for a couple weeks the pump started leaking. Now it drips oil after pumping which makes it a mess. The oil itself is clear and almost odorless so it is probably good quality, but with such a poor delivery system, I would not buy it again.

These grass fed beef sticks actually taste better than your tradition Slim Jim type meat sticks. Everyone of course is entitled to their own preference. Therefore if you are accustomed to the drugstore brand type of meat jerkey's or sticks, then you may find Nick's Stick's a little off putting. These taste natural with no nitrites, msg or preservative like artificial tastes that you typically get with a lot of other dried meat snacks. And contrary to what the other reviewer said, you can definitely taste the sea salt in this, maybe not much of the other herbs but it's okay because I like my flavor a little bit stripped down to the essentials and not covered up with different flavors that overlap one another

It has a nutty aftertaste, and is lighter than most oils in your cabinet.<br />I am already feeling the benefits as I have colon cancer, and the Hemp oil has helped regulate my system and kept my energy levels up.<br />Thanks again for a great product and great service.

review/summary: My favorite OIL! wonderful!
review/text: If you want a very nutritious oil for your cooking and even!!! facial and body oil needs, this is the one to have! (besides Coconut oil, of course). I use them both ways and the results are simply amazing: no more wrinkles, and never hungry! It goes into everything raw, like salads and even smoothies made of veggies. I don't use it for(heat) cooking, it's too precious for that. Use olive oil instead.<br />It's color is deep green, and when you pour some of it into your palm, you can literally see it's smooth and beautiful texture! It has a light nutty taste, and I cannot stress enough how big the health benefits are: I never feel hungry, I don't gain weight! and I have a smooth face at soon 60 years of youth! Don't believe anybody who sells you a non-fat diet! Our body NEEDS fats to be healthy, and the right fats don't make you fat, to the contrary: you have energy, stamina and healthy body cells! This is another item I will continue to use.<br />I just have one wish: I want to see it on the "subscribe and save" list of items, so that I won't have to remember when to order a fresh batch!

review/summary: Skin Care Miracle That's Also Tasty??
review/text: I suffer from Rosacea, which for me, is basically a bumpy rash on my face that burns and itches simultaneously (and looks hideous). I heard that Hemp Oil could help, and for the price was willing to try anything. What I found was astonishing! It was instantly soothing and much of the rash cleared up overnight. It's also a light, non-greasy moisturizer that doesn't make the rest of my skin break out. I have spent hundreds of dollars on prescriptions that did nothing but make my face burn and itch more and in months could not do what this stuff did in days. My rosacea is not completely gone. I still have flare ups, but it is under the best control it has ever been. I am not a doctor and have no idea why this works, but in my opinion its a miracle. Plus, it makes a darned tasty salad dressing too. What other product can do that?

review/summary: Will NOT fail a drug test
review/text: I know a concern of many in consuming hemp oil is failing workplace drug tests. For this reason hemp product manufacturers have started a program called TestPledge to educate consumers in this area. I highly suggest reading this page for an interesting explanation:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Briefly outline:<br /><br />TestPledge requires that pledging companies achieve this goal by committing to the following THC limits:<br /><br />  * Hemp oil: 5.0 parts per million (ppm)<br />  * Hemp nut: 1.5 parts per million (ppm)<br /><br />How much hemp oil and hemp nut can you eat?<br /><br />At the 5 ppm THC TestPledge limit for hemp oil, a person would have to eat in excess of 8 tablespoon servings - half of an 8 oz. bottle - of pure hemp oil per day to ingest 600 �g THC, the dose found not to cause confirmed positive urine tests for marijuana with a wide margin of safety. To increase this margin even further and to address any and all health concerns, setting the daily THC intake at 500 �g per day still allows for slightly over 7 tablespoon servings daily.<br /><br />THC limits for TestPledge were set low enough to allow for the extensive daily consumption of both hemp oil and hemp nut. For example, one can consume 3 tablespoons of hemp oil AND 8.75 ounces (over a half-pound) of hemp nut before reaching the 600 �g daily dose, or 3 tablespoons of hemp oil AND 7 ounces of hemp nut before reaching the more conservative 500 �g daily dose. This example shows that even enthusiastic hemp food consumers will not be able to consume enough hemp nut and oil food products to produce a confirmed positive drug test. It also shows the TestPledge limits are set low enough to provide an ample margin of safety.<br /><br />Nutiva is one of the companies that have taken the pledge that they adhere to the testpledge criteria.

review/summary: THIS CURES ECZEMA! Worth getting for ANY reason!
review/text: __________________________________________________________________________________<br />NOTE: I have left an update on my eczema condition in the comments section of this review. To summarize the update: I tried applying the oil topically to the affected area and it stopped the itch and burn completely! Applying the hemp seed oil directly to the area will cure eczema!!! (8/15/2011)<br />__________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Couldn't be happier with this hemp seed oil. The delicious nutty flavor makes it easy to take this as a daily supplement. The texture will take some getting used to if you're taking it straight as a supplement (it is oil after all). And you can't beat the price here on Amazon. The original price is $20 and here it's half that!<br /><br />I actually decided to get this because I heard an omega6 deficiency causes eczema (a skin disease that I have). I've been taking it for about a week and my skin is showing improvement. I itch less and my skin doesn't inflame as badly. I'm thinking I need to up the dose a little bit. Maybe I'll start taking 1 full tablespoon instead of 2 teaspoons that I'm taking daily. I understand this probably won't be of use to most people simply looking for hemp seed oil, but I will update in the comments of this review about how my eczema curing progress is going. Maybe this can help someone.<br /><br />Nutiva is obviously very passionate and dedicated to the products they sell. The label on this oil is informative and their website is even more informative. By quality of this oil alone I can say I trust this company, and I'll be buying from them in the future.

review/summary: the Good & the Bad
review/text: To give an honest and fair review, I would have to start by saying that the taste and aftertaste of this product is a bit unbearable at times; definitely ruined my salad. However, I will not refrain from treating this product with its well-deserved 5-stars.<br /><br />Although the taste is not nearly as satisfying as a burger, the benefits far outweigh the "light, nutty," flavor. An immense source of omega-3's (an essential fatty acid the human body does not produce), I chose this product to replace certain fish products that claimed to do the same - I found the Oil to be easier to intake and even experimented cooking with it.<br /><br />I am new to the hemp line of products but can account for the fact that my energy levels have shown a significant increase. Proving to myself the necessity of this products ingredients for my body. All hemp products seem to have the same indescribable after-taste (not so pleasant if i had to describe it), but, I am sure that after a month of using this product my body will begin to enjoy the taste, like anything else.<br /><br />All in all, this product was well worth the buy, especially for the low rate they charge. Shipping was on par. Recommended for anyone.

review/summary: Try It For Any Ailment
review/text: Stuff cures many things.  Unlike other reviewers, we find the taste DISGUSTING - tastes like you would expect grass clippings to taste, flying out of your lawn mower.  But that does not matter.  One daughter caught foliculitis.  Hemp oil cured it. (Applied externally, and taken internally.)  One son caught a nasty mrsa staph infection at the local school gym.  Doc put him on antibiotics, which ultimately failed to cure the problem.  After that, we tried hemp oil, and it worked -  quickly.  (Again - internal and external applications, several times a day.)  Experience seems to be that we all need more oil, not less, as long as it is good oil, like this.  Worth every penny.  Will try this brand of hemp oil for any health issue, before ever visiting a doctor again.  Buy extra, and keep a bottle in the freezer for a friend!

review/summary: Better mood and less pain in about a week.
review/text: I bought this oil as a way to get a real effective dose of omega fatty acids into my diet as opposed to taking 1 or 2 grams of fish oil per day which did nothing.  I have come realize that our bodies create about 11 different kinds of omega 3 fatty acid which will not be created if you take fish oil which contains only 2.  There are only 2 essential fatty acids alpha linolenic acid(omega 3), and linoleic acid(omega 6) your body makes what it needs from these if you get enough in your diet.  After about a week of taking this I noticed that my mood that has been fairly depressive for years had improved to the point of wanting to go workout again, this coupled with a significant decrease in overall body pain has allowed me to stake claim to a better life.

review/summary: Buy For Health, Not For Taste
review/text: If you are buying hemp oil, consider it for the health benefits and not the taste. Nutiva's Hemp Oil is descried as having a "nutty" taste. It does not taste nutty, but rather "earthy."<br /><br />Its about a 5/10 taste wise; not terrible, not great. I've tried using it as a replacement for olive oil, but the taste of the oil comes through too strongly.<br /><br />This product may be a good use to throw in for shakes or smoothies for its health benefits, but I do not consider this a viable replacement for traditional oils.<br /><br />EDIT: I've found mixing in hemp oil in shakes or making salad dressings is quite tasty.

review/text: This is the irst bottle of hempseed oil I ever purchased after hearing about the health benefits of it on tv. It seems like a good price for the amount you get and the taste of this oil is delicious. Something I really like about this Nutiva hempseed oil is the bottle they send it in. Its basically spill proof. You can turn the bottle upside down, hold it over a spoon, and nothing will come out until you squeeze the bottle. You have incredibly fine control over the amount you wish to get out of the bottle. After having just purchased a bottle of flax seed oil which pours straight down the side of the bottle instead of onto the spoon like it is supposed to, I was very impressed with this product. Both the taste and spill-proof bottle design are great.

review/summary: Hemp Oil - a great facial product!
review/text: The product arrived in a timely manner. It has a nice flip open cap with a squeeze nozzle type deal similar to mustard or ketchup. The oil is a rich green color. I've used the oil on pasta (it has directions to make a salad dressing on the bottle) and I like the flavor a lot. The flavor is kind of a warm, rich, nutty kind of flavor. What I bought the product for was not for food though. I bought it for my read dry skin on my face. I got really bad sunburn last summer on my face and it's been flaking ever since on my cheeks. So, I squirt a little bit on a sock and rub my face with it! The flakes of skin come right off and it helps my skin. It hasn't given me acne and this oil miraculously does NOT clog pores. I shaved my head and gave myself a mohawk but I noticed I had really bad dry scalp on the sides and it was disgusting. I treated my head with this stuff for about a week and now it doesn't have any flakes and is completely healed... my face is being stubborn though... the sun really cooked it last summer. If you're looking for a healthy product for your face and your food then buy this stuff... it's great!

review/summary: Great Oil, Good For You
review/text: I've purchased a few different types of hempseed oil and hempseed products.  The taste takes a little getting used to, but the benefits are wonderful.  Think flaxseeds, but without the negative side effects--though the flavor is definitely much stronger.  As far as the flavor: I have to say its a bit like melted unsalted high-quality butter (with that almost sweet quality) but also has a nutty taste that reminds me of fresh pine nuts (though a little more bitter and, well, maybe a touch skunky).  The pungency reminds me of sesame oil too, even though it's not nearly that potent a smell/taste nor as deep a flavor.<br /><br />The problem with hempseed oil though is that it has a tendency to go rancid.  I was a little worried ordering this online precisely because of that, but I was pleasantly surprised.  My Amazon.com oil arrived promptly and tasted really fresh.  It kept well in my fridge, and didn't go rancid for quite a while.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying this again!

review/text: Just make sure you keep this refrigerated so it doesn't spoil, and it has a low burn temperature so it's not recommended for cooking. I love this for vinegar and oil dressing, pasta, and putting it in shakes for my kids (they get the omega 3 and omega 6 benefits without knowing it). There really is no flavor to it so you can put it on a numerous amount of cold foods or already prepared cooked foods. I also got sunburned on my shoulders and back so my husband rubbed some of this on and it really helped relieve the burn and I barely peeled. It soaked in my skin well and wasn't very "oily" at all. The hemp oil I got came with 2 bottles so I gave one to my mother-in-law and she loves it also and asked me to order more. Great product :)

review/text: I've been using this stuff for over a year now, probably have gone through six bottles.  I use them solely in Smoothies. I make smoothies every day instead of one of my meals using super food powders Spirulina, Wheatgrass, Chlorella, Superfood Greens, Maca, and bananas, apples, grapes or cantaloupe in season, always add parsley and sometimes other veggies without stems, almonds and pumpkin seeds, recently stopped using flax seeds, a long squirt of Hemp Seed Oil, two heaping teaspoons of Coconut Oil, and couple spoons of Xylitol in place of sugar.  Add plenty of water and blend until smooth.<br />This makes you lose weight and keeps it off. My frayed vertebre is feeling much stronger since last year, and now with ten minutes of exercise each day plus my 2 mile walks 4x a week, at 70 years old I'm feeling better than I have in years, and the bout of sciatica that hit me two years ago is practically gone except for a minor residue - I'm actually healing, my body is improving, rejuvenating.  No drugs thank you, they only mask your symptoms but keep you deteriorating without you noticing until it's too late.<br />Hemp seed oil is an excellent product. It's high in Omega 3 and 6 fatty acid in best ratio available so it says.  I like the squeeze bottle it comes in for smoothies, very convenient.

review/text: When they discovered 2 fibroids in my uterus during this (my first) pregnancy, I started looking into natural alternatives to keep the situation under control until the time comes for medical intervention...or to fend off medical intervention to begin with. Studies have shown that natural hemp oil 2tbsp per day aid in the shrinkage of fibroids as it brings restorative/balancing effects to the uterine lining and female hormones alike. Its safe to take (dr hasnt said NO to it) so I continue. NOW...I think it tastes very close to "wretched". MOST days I only take 1tbsp.  But my fibroids have not grown since their discover in week 18 (am 25weeks now) and infact they ARE getting smaller. I am now tolerating the taste too!<br /><br />PS: my cap was BROKEN on arrival.

review/summary: Excellent Oil for Heart
review/text: One of the questions that people are sure to ask about hemp oil is whether it has any psychoactivity. The answer is no.<br />Hemp oil contains 57% linoleic (LA) and 19% linolenic (LNA) acids, in the three-to-one ratio that matches our nutritional needs. These are the essential fatty acids (EFAs)-so called because the body cannot make them and must get them from external sources.<br />I use hemp oil in salad dressings, give it to my puppy with his food, and just drink it from the bottle with my vit E, CoQ10, Selenium, ALA, & a-d cocktail. Doesn't taste that bad either, didn't notice any nutty flavor or get high. But we don't go there anymore.<br />Amazon.com has a great price on the 24oz. bottles (Nutivia Organic)

review/summary: This product is great for your hair.
review/text: I use this product directly on my hair because my hair loses protein and gets very frizzy and dry.I have tried many other natural products to help this problem, but none of them worked and neither did the expensive hair salon products or the over the counter products. So when I finally tried hemp seed oil, I was amazed from it's results. I use this product every day after I shower and after my hair dries it is so soft and manageable and so much easier to style because of that. For those of you who don't have frizzy or dry hair can still use this as a treatment or add some of the product to your shampoo or conditioner for added moisture. I researched the benefits that hemp seed oil has for your hair, and it has a lot of benefits. If you don't believe me look it up online yourself or just try it. I was buying the brand name "Natures Alchemy" from www.healthdesigns.com because it states that it is only for cosmetic use- not for food. I was wary if there was a difference of effectiveness from the other hemp seed oil brands that state they are for food. Well I tried it, and there is no difference. Hemp seed oil is hemp seed oil. They probably put another ingredient in the cosmetic one that you shouldn't eat-that's probably the only difference. But the Natures Alchemy brand for the cosmetic use only is a lot more expensive and you only get a small amount. So don't waste your money and just buy this one because it will last a lot longer and it is worth it.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I am always looking for new "healthy" products to add to my diet and this one is a definite "keeper". I have tried flax seed oil and it is OK but I switched to the capsules because the taste was not something I would classify as that great. I read the reviews on this Product before I purchased it and so decided to try it. I eat a salad almost daily and I am a straight oil and vinegar gal with a little seasoning salt plus coarse black pepper. The first time I tasted this Hempseed oil I was a little disappointed and thought it tasted like fresh green grass. Since I am not one to taste once and then pitch it I kept putting it one my salad. Now I can't imagine using any other oil (I am so addicted to this oil and I love the taste)I am on my second bottle and will continue to buy it. Others say it has a nutty taste but I don't think so. I don't know what to compare it with but It is just plain delicious and I am getting my Omega-3's. Nutiva thanks for a great product. Next I plan to try the seeds which others recommend.

review/summary: Oil of the Seed of the Hemp
review/text: Hemp seed oil is good for you, but I eat it anyway. I like the taste, much like an aged extra virgin olive oil. I particularly like it on popcorn and in salads. Unlike olive oil, keeping it in the refrigerator doesn't turn it into a yellowish lard-like solid; it remains liquid. It is too delicate to fry things with, but most of the things I eat aren't fried anyway. I don't slather it on bread because I'm allergic to gluten and have to avoid bread, but alone or mixed with balsamic vinegar it should be good for dipping bread. I think it has all of those Omega threes and sixes that everybody raves about, but it is an acquired taste that I'm glad to have acquired.

I have had no problems with allergies, my digestion is better than it has been in a long time, and I'm feeling like I have more energy reserves than I have had for a long time. Still not walking a mile, or even able to go outdoors, but with Lupus, that's probably asking a lot. Just feeling more alert is a blessing.

review/text: I don't give out many 5 stars but this product gets it. I've been taking it every day since it arrived 10/7/12, 1/3 cup in my Budwig mixture to help me recover from being diagnosed with 2 large brain tumors on 6/15/12 that had reached a critical size and were greatly affecting my ability to communicate and function.  I have chosen to build my immune system exclusively and not put 1 drop of chemo-poison, radiation-poison, or surgery/cutting approach and I am using this product to help me in my healing and recovery.  This oil also tastes fantastic. I eat my delicious Budwig mix with nuts, hemp seed, cinnamon and love the taste and it fills me up all day.  I had heard taking this oil takes away hunger craves and it has for me. It is very green in color which means it has many good anti-oxidants present too. I had been buying and using allot of flax oil but I much prefer this oil and know Nutiva is a very reputable company and Hemp Oil is without question the healthiest oil one can take.  The price of this product is very reasonable and much less expensive than flax oil as well, about 1/2 the cost. I ordered the 1 Gallon container and will be buying more.  The more you read and research Hemp Oil the more likely you'll be to buy and use it. I am well pleased with this vendor as well.  Will update this entry after my next MRI and share results.

review/summary: Best source of omega 3 and 6
review/text: Besides being the best source of omega 3 and omega 6, it just tastes so good. I'm a vegetarian and had tried flax seed oil, but that tasted so bad i had to stop. So i do eat eggs from time to time so i get some omegas from that source. But when i started looking on the net for another source of omegas i read an article by Dr Andrew Weil [...] that told of hemp oil having the perfect balance of omegas (1 to 3 of omega 3 to omega 6). So i decided to try it. Now i use it on toast instead of anything else. And some on my daily salad. It has a great light nutty flavor. And i just heard that omegas are a blood thinner in case you need that in your life. To sum up, if you are a vegetarian or vegan and want a great source of omegas, get some hemp seed oil. Nutiva brand in the 24oz at amazon seems to be the best price i have found around and i have been eating this for a few years now, and its organic to boot. Grown and processed in Canada which, unlike the silly US, allows hemp to be grown for food, paper and other products. Enjoy and be healthy!

review/summary: Seemed worth a try at first, but, with use, it's really hateful.
review/text: Just got my first bottle. Delivery unproblematic: fulfilled by "Amazon LLC."; seems of good quality; came very fast. Like Barlean's flax oil, it comes in a non-trasparent-black, squeezable, very soft plastic bottle with a valve in the spout. The bottle is sealed under the cap: you gotta unscrew the cap and peel off the seal before you can use it. Press date is in September, which is a bit old, but otoh, hemp oil isn't as perishable as flax oil, so maybe it's OK.<br /><br />Since I've just learned of the purported health benefits of this oil, I can only comment on the taste of it: on the bottle, and here, and elsewhere online, hempseed oil is said to have a really nice, "nutty" flavour. Well, not true: actually, it's more medicinal/grassy, reminiscent of rosemary. Not unpleasant, but nothing special -- actually, flax is marginally better (though I don't particularly like it either). I suspect that were it not for their purported healthfulness, no one would use either of these oils. But supposedly they're good, so we'll see. Unlike flax oil (which has some solids floating in it and needs to be shaken up before use), hemp oil has a homogeneous consistency -- like any other cooking oil, except for the colour: a sort of of luminous green, believe it or not; quite a bit like antifreeze. So these are my initial impressions; I'll update this review if I discover anything noteworthy as I use it.<br /><br />12/28/10: I have to bring the stars down: the taste is horrible; in a matter of days I've grown to hate it -- it's like a greasy medicine of some sort, an emetic. There's _nothing_ it's good with, it SPOILS the taste of anything you add it to. Why do health foods taste so bad? Are they really healthful or it's just hype 'cause the maker wants to sell it? I really can't recommend this product (though it was delivered fine, and in good packaging, so the manufacturing part is fine; just the oil itself is horrible). Flax oil is far less disgusting.<br /><br />01/08/2011: Just poured the remaining half-bottle down the toilet. A solemn moment of personal liberation. Healthful my as.

review/text: I purchased this for the health benefits.  Unfortunately I couldn't get past the taste.  The oily grassy taste was too much.  It ruined the flavor of anything I put it in.

review/summary: not the best
review/text: These dates are ok, but I've tasted better ones (medjool dates are the best, in my opinion). These don't taste as sweet as the medjool ones. My only concern with this particular brand is if they have germs on them, since they are from overseas and don't have preservatives on them, which keeps them clean (preserves them).... For now, I'm going to be buying medjool dates and buy them locally, if I can.

review/text: I kept trying to order these direct, but they were always out-of-stock when I was doing an order large enough to get free shipping.  I found them here on Amazon, and was able to order along with other items to get me free Amazon Super shipping!  The tea is great -- not too mild, but not too weak.  Now I know where to search for my favorite tea K-cups!

review/summary: My Favorite Moscato.
review/text: If you're a white wine drinker like myself and enjoy them on the sweet, fruity side, you will enjoy this wine.  I chill it on ice and enjoy it immensely.  It has the hints of apricot, honey, and a touch of citrus.  Pick some up and find out why it's won awards.  There are other good moscatos out there, but this one has a reasonable price tag, and it's suitable for any event.  You can party with it, and it adds a bit of sophistication to the affair, or you can enjoy it at home while you're relaxing.  Pick some up today and see for yourself.  If you like sweet white wine, Barefoot won't disappoint you!

review/summary: Great Hedgehog Food!
review/text: Although this is listed as Cat Food it does adequately meet the dietary needs of hedgehogs.  Most commercial hedgehog foods on the market are mostly filler and contain little nutritional value for hedgehogs.  However, there are various top end cat foods that contain the necessary fat/protein levels to sustain a healthy hedgehog and avoid fatty liver related cancers and diseases.  This is one of the few cat foods I have found which a) provides the proper nutritional balance for my hedgehog and b) he seems to enjoy eating immensely!  I would recommend this to anyone raising a hedgehog who wishes them to be healthy and happy.

We recently made the switch and in just a week I have noticed their coats are so much softer and they seem to have more energy and i have not see any throwing up but it may be too soon to tell if this helps with hairballs etc.... so far so good.<br /> We will be sticking with Wellness as as it is top notch and the cats are not complaining!

review/summary: Buyer beware, Proctor & Gamble has ruined this food!
review/text: My girlfriend and I have been rescuing, fostering, and adopting out (through a rescue group) cats and kittens for over 10 years. We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy. So we're very experienced in all aspects of cat care, and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods. The foods are more expensive, but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions!<br /><br />We had been using Innova Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food for several years, once we discovered that it included no by-products, corn filler, or other junk ingredients. Our cats loved the food, which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety.<br /><br />Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months. We heard that Proctor & Gamble, manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods, had purchased Natura Pet Products, maker of the Innova, Healthwise, and California Natural brands, among others. Proctor & Gamble has questionable pet food testing practices (search the internet for it), so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way. So we were very upset about P&G's purchase of Natura, but we stuck with the Innova Cat & Kitten food for the short run, hoping we could later find a better alternative.<br /><br />Well strangely enough, for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat & Kitten that we've purchased, something has changed. The food is much more "crumbly", i.e. there is a lot more "food dust" in the bags, and the kibble looks a little different. We didn't think much of this change until our cats, which had previously LOVED the Innova food, lost interest in it and really didn't want to eat it. In the dry food mix we make, we noticed that very often, the cats would eat the other part of the mix, and leave the Innova Cat & Kitten behind. Clearly there is something different about the way P&G manufactures this food, as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products.<br /><br />This is EXPENSIVE food, and for the money you pay, it should be TOP QUALITY. Well, it ISN'T anymore! We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls (which are usually totally empty after feeding time), and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover, unwanted.<br /><br />So that was it; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat & Kitten to the store we'd purchased them from, and will never buy this food again. In fact, we've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products, which include Healthwise and California Natural. We did find a good quality alternative cat food called "Simply Nourish", and when we tried it with our cats, they LOVED it. There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls, and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality.<br /><br />WARNING: For anyone currently purchasing "Innova Cat & Kitten", or planning to buy it in the future, we believe P&G appears to have changed the way this food is made, for the worse. We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money, and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market. AVOID this food, it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it did before P&G bought Natura Pet Products, and ruined it!

review/summary: sad...
review/text: I am so sad about this food. I have fed my animals evo and innova after P&G took over and ruined Iams and Eukanuba. I searched for a good food and I found the best food in the Nutura pet food. Organic USA based, all of there supply chain was controlled by them and it was all use products. It was the only food that was not involved with pet food recalls back in 2007. P&G has signed a contract stating that they will not change the recipe until June of 2012. Well guess what we are here and the food has already changed. It changed almost instantly after they bought it. The food was just not the quality it used to be. Crumbly and dusty. It won't be long and everything about the food especially their good name will change...

review/text: My 6 month old male Tuxedo cat likes Innova Cat and Kitten Dry Food, which is a round pellet shaped kibble. Based on the stated ingredients and nutritional information, I award Innova Cat and Kitten Dry Food "5 Stars," even though the bag does not feature a resealable strip, which is a nice feature that some other kibble cat food bags have.
