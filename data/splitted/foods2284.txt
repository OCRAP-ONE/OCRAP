review/summary: No taste
review/text: I usually drink the regular Caffe D"Vita but I am on a low carb diet with no sugar so I thought I would try the sugar free. I couldn't find it in the stores so I bought a six pack can through the internet. It has absolutly no taste. Now I am stuck with six cans of sugar free Caffe D" Vita and don't know what to do with them. I would not buy this product again.

review/text: A (5) case free-shipping customer for years, my method for mixing this concoction is: More is better.<br />I add no less than (3) heaping teaspoons to either 8 or 12 oz. hot water, it doesn't matter.<br />You want chocolate goodness, don't you? Sure you do. We all do.<br />Buy it by the bulk or an amazon. free-ship program, but USE (3) TEASPOONS per mug or you won't get the chocolate blast you've been anticipating.<br />Well, I gotta go now. I took a poster's advise and called my local Smart & Final and 24 oz. are on sale for $9. and I think I hear my mother calling me.....

I can (and do) have one of these every day for 2 weeks for what I would pay for one "designer" drink at a coffee shop.  OK, I'll admit it, I'm addicted!

review/summary: Mix it with cofeemate and instant coffee and sugar free vanilla syrup
review/text: Love this stuff; I recently went on a no sugar no flour diet, and I stopped caffeine; so this is perfect. I use a medium mug, and I add about 1.5 tbsp. sugar free mocha, then two tablespoons cofeemate regular powder, then about a 1/2 tsp. Tasters Choice house decaf and then about 1 tsp. of the brand Target carries of sugar free vanilla syrup. Other brands are too strong or not vanilla flavored enough. Anyway, try this combo - especially for those of you who are not using your cans anymore, this will perk it up to a delicous tasting mocha.<br />Trust me!

review/text: My husband and I have been using the Caffe D'Vita products for 17 years straight.  We are so pleased with the taste and quality of this product.  There is no comparison.  It is our "treat" at the end of the day, and you don't have to worry about the caffeine, since it is virtually caffeine-free.  He uses the regular mocha flavor, and I use the sugar-free, which helps to save calories for me.  We will continue to enjoy our nightly cappuccino, and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a warm drink that tastes amazing, and is easy to use.

review/text: I've tried lots of different cappuccino mixes and by far and away this is my favorite! I like that it's sugar free and has no trans fats so I can enjoy it without feeling like I'm going to have to slog through extra long workouts or that I'm hopelessly clogging my arteries.<br /><br />I have a fairly large mug and I make it using two mounded teaspoons of Cafe D'vita Sugar Free Mocha, 2 scant tablespoons of fat free coffee creamer and about 1/4 teaspoon of instant coffee. Very satisfying. I drink it almost every day and don't have to feel guilty if I have more than one cup in a day.

review/summary: Just plain tastes bad
review/text: (09/08/09) I really enjoy the regular sugar-type Caffe D'Vita, but I wanted to try the sugar-free version to reduce calories.  It looks extra creamy in the cup, but my girlfriend and I were both very disappointed with the flavor.  She wouldn't even finish her first cup.  I got mine down, but didn't enjoy it.  It just tastes bad--almost bitter.  I wasted the money to buy a whole 6-pack of cans, and now I'm going to take it to work to put in the break room; maybe others will find it tolerable if it's free.<br /><br />(Update: 10/26/09) I did take the 5 1/2 cans to work and put them in two break rooms.  There are several dozen employees using these break rooms and in about five weeks time there are still over three full cans left!  It appears that many people are not interested in trying it, and if they do, they never have it again.  I sympathize.  I have since gone back to the regular mocha version with sugar and continue to enjoy it.

review/summary: 30 mg Caffeine for watered down bland serving
review/text: Very Disappointed in this.<br /><br />So much so, that I was inspired to write my first review.<br /><br />This products labeling is just wrong:<br /><br />1) I called the company stating any cocoa has caffeine, so it cannot be 99% caffeine free.<br />They said it has 30 mg CAFFEINE per 2 tsp. serving which is too little for a good flavor.<br /><br />2) IT TAKES MORE than 2 tsp. per serving or tastes very watered down & not creamy. I<br />  I required 2 TBSP for 12 oz. water<br /><br />3) IT WASN'T SWEET at all, just enough to cut the bitter - I assume.<br />  So I preferred adding a regular amount of Stevia for a better taste.<br /><br />I suggest anyone give Hills Bros Sugar free french vanilla cappuccino a try.<br />Besides tasting great, you'll only get 30mg max. of caffeine for a satisfying 12 oz. serving.<br /><br />Bon Appetit

I use products with artificial sweetner all the time so it is not like I'm missing the sugar. Don't know why this stuff tastes so bad. Sugar free hot cocoa tastes great so not sure what went wrong here. Anyway here is my recipe... take 1 envelope of sugar free cocoa mix (the kind with milk in the mix) and add one teaspoon of instant coffee or instant espresso and 1 packet of equal add hot water. Voila, tastes way better than this stuff.

review/summary: Terrible product!
review/text: The idea of an instant cappuccino sounded very appealing until I tried this product. I was very disappointed. What's even more disappointing is the product description on the package is deceiving, claiming it's creamy, flavorful, etc.  Don't believe it! I can only describe this product as "flavored sugar".  It wasn't creamy, could barely taste coffee in it, and is very watery.  I even tried mixing it in milk instead of water (per package directions) and it's still very bland although it was way too sweet. The directions say to use "3 tsp" per cup. Even one tsp is already sweet.  Again, this is just sugar with just a bit of cheap coffee flavoring and powdered milk.  I ended up throwing away most of the product, didn't bother to finish it.  Waste of money, I would not recommend this product at all.

review/summary: A Treat to Stick With
review/text: Our three pooches get a Beefeaters Munchy Stick every day, usually in the evening. They look forward to this daily ritual with great anticipation. When the treats are presented to the three girls, each assumes her position apart from the others and commences chewing. Between five and ten minutes the Stix are history, and three happy girls are searching for some fortuitous crumbs. We've been following this routine for years and the dogs have never tired of these chew treats. We do vary the flavor of the Stix, and have even purchased Beefeater variations on the theme that target the coat, calm jittery nerves, or help build cartilage with glucosamine. Occasionally we've run out of Beefeeaters and had to substitute other brands while waiting for our mail order supply to arrive. Our pooches seem to prefer the Beefeaters brand.<br /><br />No matter which flavor we choose, the girls love their Beefeaters Munchies.

review/summary: August Happy Birthday Expectations DASHED
review/text: I really loved my first order and ordered for all my family members out of my area at Christmas.  I decided that my birthday would be perfect with my only gift coming from Shatila Foods to myself.  This Mixed Phillo Pastries order was a ghastly surprise.  By the time the order did get to me, the summer heat had done damage to the order.  Most all the anticipated gooey was all over the carton and had seeped out of the plastic and had absorbed all over and into the boxes.  I had a big mess on my hands with bubble wrap and all coated in sticky goo and the product was not as pictured 100%.  There were a couple of strange rice thread like crunchy types a row of brown and a row of white.  The brown tasted like soap.  The white didn't taste.  the first row were tiny samples of what is pictured and most of them were broken and very dry.  The baklava was OK but not sweet.  The rest were really dry and some tasted like they were over baked and burnt.  The whole box was a disappointment and I couldn't even share it with neighbors for my Birthday.  It was an embarrasement.  Not the quality I was spoiled with my previous orders.  I will not be ordering in the summertime months again if the plastic wrap won't hold the product inside the tray.  The inside of the shipping carton was even saturated.  I emailed Shatila as soon as it arrived then again 2 weeks later without acknowlegement or response.  :(

review/text: These tasty Cinnamon Cheerios are down right awesome! Cinnamon flavor is abundant within the little cheerio, causing me to want to eat by the handfuls!  I was pleasantly surprised by just how good they taste.  It is now one of my all-time favorite cereals alongside Golden Grahams.

review/summary: Another AMAZING AND DELICIOUS! addition to the Cheerios family
review/text: I was skeptical at first, of course, but after about two weeks of starring at this cereal box every morning as I contimplated what to have for breakfast, I finally caved in and tried these cheerios.  I was not dissapointed, they are so delicious and perfect in everyway.  The cinnamon flavor is not too strong but just right, and theres that  wonderful cheerio aftertaste that we all have grown to love. I hope they make these a staple in the cheerios family, because they would be missed by my taste buds for sure.  They also have 5 grams of fiber in each serving which is wonderful.  Order this and you will be coming back for more.

review/text: My husband and I each tried a bowl of this cereal and then threw the rest of the box away. Why? First, it doesn't have much cinnamon flavor compared to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4ATQ">Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cereal, 17-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 5)</a>. Second, it leaves a strange film on the inside of your mouth, much like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0AJX0">Cap'n Crunch, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>. And third, it has a strange texture once it is submerged in milk - the texture which comes to mind most readily is cardboard. I know that is unflattering, but it just doesn't crunch like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VZ7W52">Cheerios Honey Nut Cereal, 12.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0A6C4">Cheerios Cereal, 14-Ounce Box (Pack of 4)</a> (which we love).

review/summary: Love Jasmine
review/text: I've been drinking jasmine tea for over 20 years. But it usually can't be found in a grocery store. Some health food stores stock a variety of green teas, but not all brands are the same. Once I find one I like, I stick with it. When my vendor stopped selling Prince of Peace, I went online. Now it's a breeze. I go to Amazon and order!

review/summary: is this green tea with jasmine essential oil?
review/text: I just bought this at the local chinese market - Great Wall - and I found the taste too "bright". It tasted too perfumey, as if all they did was get some green tea and added jasmine essential oil. The tea smells EXACTLY like Honeysuckle essential oil that I add to the bath - so I was feeling a little funny drinking this tea instead of soaking in it.<br /><br />After I got over the taste of the essential oil, I realized it is a nice perfumey taste, but I am used to the tin boxes you can get at the Chinese store and when you open up the canister - there is dried up tiny white jasmine flowers that add to the fragrance.  This tastes nothing like the chinese jasmine tea that I am used to.  It tastes like a pumped up essential oil of jasmine added to green tea. I am very disappointed in the taste. Well, I only spent $2.99 on it, so I am tossing it, and going back to see if I can get another brand. Disappointed because I can't find the loose leaf tea with the tiny flowers.<br /><br />By the way - there is nothing quite like the flavor sensation of real chinese jasmine tea while munching on crystalized chinese ginger.  However, this tea is so strident in its flavoring that I am not sure you would be able to taste the crystalized giner.<br /><br />I looked up another of their jasmine teas - and here they clearly talk about the real jasmine flowers in the tea.  That is not so with this product. This product is fine if you enjoy this taste - but for me, it is nothing like the ones with real flowers.

review/text: I recently started supplementing with Similac Advance and find its taste matches the closest with breastmilk. My baby hated Enfamil/Gerber. However, I found BJs carries this a lot cheaper at $28 for a 34 oz can compared to $40 per can here. The price difference is HUGE and not sure why someone would buy this from here. Even target carries the formula a lot cheaper. Amazon seems to have missed the price competitiveness on such a widely used product.

review/text: I am a huge fan of Shirakiku brand shichimi togarashi, but I can't buy it in bags anywhere any more, so I thought I'd try this "See Smell Taste" brand.  While this brand does have a lot of flavor and is very fresh, the flavor is overwhelmingly Sichuan pepper, that's pretty much all I can taste with this brand, so I didn't like it at all.  In the Shirakiku brand, the flavors are balanced so on one of the seven seasonings in the blend comes through too much.

review/summary: The quintessential Belgian ale!
review/text: Chimay is the gold standard for Belgian ales.  Chimay red, with an alcohol volume of 7%, is full of flavor without being overly heavy or cloyingly sweet.  If your beer preference is for pilsners or American "light" beers, I would recommend passing on this one.  However, if you have a taste for micro brews and lesser known foreign ales, I strongly recommend giving this one a try.  The 750ml corked bottle is the perfect size for sharing with a friend.  Serve with a nice cheese platter and an artisian loaf of bread for a special added touch!

review/summary: The Best Yet!!
review/text: We have an 18 year old Siamese that has had hairball issues her whole life. We have tried every suggestion our vet has made, invested in most of the hairball products out there. Prior to the IAMS Adult Hairball Care, we used the regular IAMS hairball formula. It did the job, but this new Proactive Health Adult formula appears to work more gently, therefore, she seems to be more comfortable and the throwing up hairballs has stopped almost entirely. It is also interesting to find out that when given a couple dry foods, side by side, that she will always go to this one. We have fed our cat this product since it made an appearance in our area a few months ago and the convenience of getting it through Amazon is a bonus!!

review/summary: Healthiest cat ever
review/text: A while back, when my cat was around seven years old, I noticed he was starting to drink more water.  I know what that means -- his kidneys were starting to struggle with the protein load; something which affects all cats if they live long enough.<br /><br />With other cats, as they aged or started showing signs of trouble, I switched them to Feline KD Prescription Diet, something available only from vets.  it's healthy for them, but it's expensive, inconvenient to get, and the cats don't like it very much.  Since my current boy had been eating Iams all his life, and this "Active Maturity"  had just become available, I thought we'd give it a try. It's been great.<br /><br />His water consumption went back to normal. He looks fabulous and incredibly healthy -- perfect teeth, perfect eyes, shiny gorgeous fur.<br /><br />My only complaint might be that he likes it a little *too* much, if you know what I mean. I'm in danger of having a fat cat who begs for  more constantly. (He's licking my arm to try to convince me to feed him as I type this!) But that's more a problem with the cat, than the food.

He also seems to love this food and gets excited when I go in to the kitchen... that's his time to show off (I think) that he can eat.<br />This comes in a 5 pack and Amazon shipped it right away, so no complaints there.<br /><br />Edit:  March 20, 2011<br /><br />I can not recommend this food anymore. Too many recalls and the ingredients are garbage. I am using Chicken Soup for the Cat Lovers Soul and my furry friend looks better, lost weight and is more active. To Iams... you have lost a customer due to your outsourcing and horrible product quality control.

review/summary: Wonderful Pumpkin Taste
review/text: These are great. It is just like having Thanksgiving Day any time you wish: breakfast, lunch, dinner or snack. Not as smoothly delicious as a real Pumpkin Pie, but close enough without having to do any work to get it: eat heated or cold. I love these things and wish they were available all year long at a reasonable price. Alas. They are Seasonal. So get them while you are able and enjoy them to the hilt. I order some every year. It is November and these are still fresh and tasty. By later in December, my experience tells me that they will have begun to lose some of that fabulous fresh Pumpkin Spurt of Taste. So order now for full enjoyment. I love them and hope you will too!<br /><br />In time for the holidays, Gingerbread is also available. You may wish to also give them a try!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z6ATAG">Kellogg's Pop-Tarts Printed Fun - Gingerbread (Limited Edition) - 12 Pastries, 21.1-oz. Box</a><br /><br />May 2012: In late April, I was looking through the Pop Tart Selection and saw that these Pumpkin Tarts were still available. Now, my brain told me that they had been originally baked probably in October of 2011; maybe as late as November, 2011 if I was very lucky. But, my desire for these Pumpkin treats overcame my thoughts about their being about 6 months old if any were still available for sale, so I ordered another set. Pretty darned good still. They are fatter and plumper to start with than the regular tarts, so that gives them an edge on keeping their fresheness. In all the boxes, I found only 2 tarts (1 package) that were stale. The rest were Almost as good as they were when they were originally made. For a short amount of time, my rational mind said I should give some serious consideration to what Kellogs is using as a stabilizer to keep these fresh. BUT, then, I thought, YOU are the one eating PopTarts. Just be like Alfred E. Neuman...why worry! If you are not eating fresh fruit, or a health food bar, or a slenderizing shake, then you aren't fooling anyone but yourself. So, being driven by my desire to have something that tastes Pumpkin and Yummy, I continued munching my Tart that was, at least, 5-6 months old. Pop it in the toaster and it is like New. So, if I could give these another Star, I would. Still Recommended!!!

review/text: I actually enjoy the taste of this stuff, but it does not taste like green tea, to be honest. It also tastes better if slightly diluted. Here's the real PROBLEM: Any of these colored drink mixes -- even the sugar free ones -- are being found by dentists to be just as bad for your teeth as sugary drinks and soda. I stopped drinking these mixes after I learned that. If you're looking for healthier, this isn't necessarily the option. Go with real tea.

review/summary: This WAS a great product
review/text: I have been using the full line of Lipton's Green Tea to Go for a couple of years now, and just love it. Have also turned countless friends onto it as well.  Love the benefits of green tea, being able to avoid soda...and that it is sweetened with Splenda.  Splenda was the primary reason for chosing the Lipton line.  But NOW all that has changed and Lipton has made the decision to switch to Aspartame...which doctors tell you to avoid if you experience headaches.  Aspartame is not very good for us, folks...but it must be cheaper.  (Google it and see what you find!)  Lipton has fallen out of brand loyalty for me and it is a window into their practices that they would switch to a lesser, more controversial ingredient.  I'm sure there is plenty of marketing spin they can site for this reason, but facts are facts.  I'm told by friends that Jackie Chan has a line worth checking out, now that it's Lipton no more for me.

review/summary: BEWARE ~ NO SPLENDA - FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!
review/text: I ordered this BECAUSE it said it was Splenda sweetened.  Upon receiving the tea, there isn't one grain of Splenda in this box - it's ASPARTAME sweetened!<br /><br />The flavor is ok...diluted - I use a 22oz Thermos of cold water and 1 packet...any less water and the Aspartame gives a 'bite' to it that I don't care for.<br /><br />I will stick with ARIZONA brand tea packets as I have been using them for years and they are sweetened with Splenda...order being placed for Arizona now.<br /><br />ADD: This packet isn't filled very much, it's about 1/4 filled with power, a big waste of the material used to hold it.  Vs. Arizona Tea: The Arizona is filled 3/4 full of powder and flavors a 22 oz Thermos nicely - the Lipton makes a very weak flavor.  For your money - buy Arizona powdered teas.

review/summary: Doesn't have Splenda after all
review/text: I had written a previous review in 2008, stating how great I thought these were. I have changed my mind. Even though it states under Important Information that it has splenda under the ingredients, Lipton quietly changed these to ASPARTAME at least two years ago. You will realize it after it arrives, as it does say aspartame on the box. It is fairly hard to find green tea stix with splenda, but I discovered AriZona Pomegranate Green Tea Iced Tea Stix Sugar Free (Splenda), and that is what I drink now.

review/summary: Gentle, Refreshing Taste
review/text: I have been trying to cure myself of a bad cola habit for years, but I have never been able to find something that I liked as much. So, when I mixed the flavor (Black Currant and Pear) with the carbonated water, I held the glass to my lips with trepidation. Wow! I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor, which is light and refreshing. The light flavor seems to complement a warm, lazy summer day. I haven't tried it yet, but the light taste makes me think it would make a great float with vanilla ice cream. This flavor is not as sweet as some colas because it doesn't have as much corn syrup as the more commercial colas; it has sugar AND 'burnt sugar syrup' (which contains sugar, glucose syrup, and water)--but I got used to the real sugar taste immediately.<br /><br />The cost per liter to use this mix is more than for commercial soda. There are 25 servings per container, so I'll let you do the math. As for calories--my favorite cola is 150 calories per serving; this mixture with carbonated water is only 90 calories per serving.<br /><br />You do not have to have a SodaStream machine to use this--I use Twist n'Sparkle to carbonate the water as it has a smaller footprint. But, you can actually use this in seltzer water (not club soda because of the minerals added). If you use seltzer, DON'T shake the bottle--SLOWLY pour a bit of the mixture in and just gently roll the bottle in your hand until you see it mixing. If you use this mix with Twist n' Sparkle, put the mixture in the bottle AFTER carbonation. Enjoy!

review/text: I think SodaStream will have more success making new flavors rather than trying to imitate other types of drinks like coke, diet coke, and root beer.  I think our taste buds are geared towards the normal brands like Coke and Pepsi.  This new flavor, currant and pear has a nice gentle flavor.  It is not over powering, similar flavor to Hanson's soda.  I will definitely try more of these new flavors after trying this one.

review/summary: Amazing Packaged Ramen
review/text: This is by far my favorite ramen, and when I have some in the house, they're always the first to go.  The last batch I bought from Amazon I started adding some additional toppings to in order to make it more of a meal.  I found that I really liked sliced hotdogs, frozen broccoli, and an egg poached in the center of the noodles for the last two minutes or so.  It was an incredibly filling meal combined with the noodles.<br /><br />A few things people might want to know about the noodles on their own:<br /><br />-The noodles themselves are not the fried white noodles you see in most instant ramen.  They're air dried yellow noodles that cook up with a nice firm chewiness to them.<br /><br />-The soy sauce/oil mixture has a very nice flavor and combines well when it's hot, but the oil starts to separate as it cools, so if you're going to drink the broth, eat quickly.<br /><br />Again, this is my favorite ramen, and well worth the ~$2/each price tag, especially if you add some protein to make it a full meal.  I can only hope Amazon restocks soon, as I've had a craving for these lately only to find them out of stock.

review/text: Grew up in Japan, what I miss most is the ramen restaurants. It's very hard to find a good ramen restaurant where I live, so only way I can get these great dishes is that I have to prepare myself. This ramen has very firm noodle compared to other cheaper kind, and soy sauce flavor of the soup is almost as good as the ones you can have at ramen restaurants in Japan! Very easy to prepare, only few minutes of boiling, and you can add boiled egg/ham/sea weed/spinach/imitation crab/steak/ground beef/tofu (just a few example), or whatever you'd like! Hope it'll come back in stock again!
