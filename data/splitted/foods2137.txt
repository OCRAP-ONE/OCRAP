review/summary: WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.....
review/text: The "healthiness" is great, as are most CLIF products.<br />The price, even with subscribe and save is way too high.<br />There is not much difference from just buying regular granola bars<br />There are only 5 packages in each box (with 2 smaller bars in each)<br />I always wonder why they make such big boxes and only put a few items in the box....who only eats 5 granola bars?

review/summary: Taste just like Chocolate Chip Cookies!
review/text: First off let me say that I've been a fan of Clif bars for a while now. So I saw these at my local grocery store and decided to give them a whirl.<br /><br />WOW! Just wow! These take exactly like crunchy chocolate chip cookies. They are absolutely delicious. I find myself craving these now instead of brownies or a candy bar. I was actually eating them in class one day and a few people tried them and now are also obsessed. Great product and completely yummy!

review/summary: Decent granola bar, but the packaging is a bit misleading
review/text: When I first opened the box I was surprised to find 5 packages of granola bars, each with 2 bars each, so a "10-pack" has 5 packages with 2 granola bars in each package (I never noticed it was normal to do that with granola bars), hence the serving size is 2 bars. The price for each packet is about the same as that of a normal clif bar, so I don't know if it's really worth it to me. You get about 60% more mass with a clif bar than with this for the same price.<br /><br />That being said, they taste decent and taste good broken into pieces with peanut butter and nutella.

review/text: These things are awesome!  I only ordered them because they were on a good sale on amazon, but now I'll gladly pay full price.<br /><br />They taste soo good!  No high fructose corn syrup, a big plus.  They do have "evaporated cane juice" as the sweetener.  I'm not familiar with it, but a quick google search shows it to be a healthier and better alternative to regular cane sugar.<br /><br />Great texture and crunch, and great flavor.  A perfect snack that is much much healthier than a lot of alternatives.<br /><br />I could not imagine a better granola bar.  Try these, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Crunched Crunch
review/text: Got these with a one-day shipping delay, but still very quickly with Amazon Prime.  The taste is quite good, perhaps a little on the sweet side - especially when you hit a pocket of white chocolate.  The big problem is the condition of the product when it arrives.  I opened my first 2-pack and the granola bars were crushed into nuggets and powder.  Strangely, the box wasn't in bad shape, just the bars.  A few days later, I opened the other box of granola bars, which was in better shape than the first one, and the first pack I tried again contained smashed fragments of granola bars.  These are no fun to eat, as you can't really open the pack and pour it into your mouth (I tried), and if you pick out the big chunks you get fragments and powder sticking to your fingers, and on your clothes (and in your beard).  I'll eat the rest, maybe out of a bowl with a spoon or something (with some fava beans and a nice chianti...), but I won't be ordering any more crunched Clif Crunch bars.

I was skeptical about this cus ived tried many imitations or 5hr energy. But nothing has worked till i tried this. It kicked in with minutes and it had the effects just like 5hr energy. I heard this is made by 5hr energy and just repackaged for costco as their kirkland brand name. Worth the $$$ and will by these instead of 5hr energy brand from now on!<br /><br />Its almost the exact same as the 5hr energy extra strength. Only difference is the niacin which is 30mg instead of 40mg. But has 2150mg of energy blend compared to 2000mg. It also has less soduim at 15mg compared to 18mg.<br /><br />Dont hesitate and buy this product!!!<br /><br />Cheers- DP

review/text: I purchased this at CostCo, at a significant savings over Amazon. I've been using 5 Hour Energy for a while but was put off by the cost. This is just as effective for me as the 5 Hour Energy and checking the labels shows that the ingredients are virtually identical. I've tried a lot of different Kirkland products over the years and can only remember being disappointed once. Seems like every product they make is as good as the original at half the price. This is the same. However, you should check out the lower rated reviews. I don't understand why the same ingredients have different effects for different people but it seems like something that should be considered.

review/text: We gave our dog 2 of these treats and they made him ill all night...I will spare you the details but it was not pretty. The treats are greasy and must be very rich. Not worth the risk unless you want a sick puppy.

review/summary: Dogs absolutely love these!
review/text: I saw these in the store the other day while looking for snacks for the doggies and once I saw they were made in the US I decided to give them a try. They smell terrific (I was tempted by them) and my dogs went absolutely nuts for them. They are a bit expensive but the way my dogs loved them and the fact that they are made in the US make them worth it for me.

review/text: I discovered these bars in the clearance cart at the grocery store with a price I could not refuse since I eat granola bars every day for breakfast.  Although they look like compressed sawdust they taste WONDERFUL!  I love the crunchy texture and have resorted to ordering them from Amazon because they are no longer locally available.  If you like almond flavoring and want to introduce more fiber into your diet I urge you to give these bars a try.

review/summary: AMAZING JERKY and SERVICE IS TOP NOTCH
review/text: I am somewhat of a jerky fanatic due to its great protein vs calorie content, and the flavor is pretty helpful as well.<br /><br />FIRST OFF, the service was awesome[not the shipping, but I am in Iraq...sooooo that probably had something to do with the time :)]  The reason I say the service was so good was due to my inspection of the package.  Upon opening I see not only my bag that I ordered, but there are also 3 other packages(samples, of which two were a fairly large amount) of different flavor/cuts of jerky.  So, not only do I get the Cajun Western Cut, I now know that the Maple Jerky is AMAZING, the Chipotle Habanero is RIDICULOUSLY FLAVORFUL(I really like hot stuff.  Not to say that this was hot, but the flavor was amazing.), and I haven't tried the spicy sample (but I am sure it is nothing short of the previous reviews)<br /><br />The original purchase is pretty tasty, but I will likely be reordering the habanero.  The cajun is lackin on the spicy side, has a decent flavor, and the cut/quality of meat is superb for all of the above.

review/text: I've been eating a lot of jerky lately, this one takes the cake! The pieces are a little on the tough side, but since it's quality meat it wasn't a problem at all. The flavor starts out immediately being sweet, but after a few seconds a nice medium heat comes in. I would not have guessed the flavor was cajun if I didn't know, but don't let that stop you. This is the best sweet/hot jerky I've ever tasted. What a wonderful unique flavor. I will definitely order this again.

review/summary: Way too sweet to be Cajun.
review/text: I had high hopes for this jerky based on the other review I read.  However I think they need to rename this product. It is described as Cajun and hot.  It was sweet like candy and had absolutely no heat to it.  I would say more like sweet Teriyaki.<br />I think this recipe needs a redo.  Jerky should not be this sweet.  The bag of jerky I bought was passed around to 5 other people who all said it was too sweet.  I spent 8 dollars on a bag and threw it in the trash.  Very disappointed.  If I could give you zero stars I certainly would.<br />I cannot recommend this to anyone and will not buy any of your products.

review/text: This juice is one of my baby's favorites. I used to buy the 4oz bottles but this is way cheaper. I like the fact that 4oz gives her a serving of fruits. The max amount of juice that babies should drink in a day is 4oz, so I fill up a bottle with equal parts of water and juice and let her drink it with her meals throughout the day. In between I also give her plenty of plain water.

review/text: When my much older children were little, Gerber sold a sweet potato juice they loved! Go Vitamin A! Gerber has changed their offerings many times over the years giving this particular item ingredient and name changes. My daughter adjusts to the changes, but will prefer this juice over all others. And now when her friends come over, they leave telling their parents, "I love carrot juice!" Unfortunately fewer and fewer stores are caring the item as the Gerber line continues to change and update . I was so glad to find it still available on Amazon. Try it. I think you will be surprised and your own child's response.

review/summary: Davidson's Tulsi Rooibos Chai Tea
review/text: Oh my goodness, this may be the tea that takes me from someone who doesn't like tea to a devoted follower of the leaves.  I absolutely loved this tea.  And since I'm still trying to convince myself to drink tea rather than soda, sugar-laden juices, and other unhealthy choices, that is a really big thing for me.<br /><br />The flavor of this tea was incredible.  I've enjoyed the occasional chai latte here and there before (the only kind of tea I could ever stand) but recently I've been branching out into other teas and discovering I actually find them more palatable without adding any kind of sweetener to them.  This tea was so delicious it didn't need any sweetener either.  I could definitely taste the cloves, that was probably the strongest thing in them.  And you could tell they were there from the aroma as well (which was also splendid).  I also tasted mint, although that wasn't listed in the ingredients.  I'm sure experts could taste the particular blends of tulsi and rooibos in here, but since this is a beginner tea for me I can't comment if there was any distinct flavor coming from there.<br /><br />The ingredients were also very good in this tea.  Everything was organic and it had a minimal list; Tulsi, Rooibos, Cinnamon, Licorice Root, Cloves and Ginger.  I always like finding organic products and this was no exception.  Although a lot of the Davidson's teas have organic ingredients, this one is advertised as so and fully encompasses the meaning.  It's also caffeine free making it a good one to have before bed.  Which it was very very relaxing and just what I needed before heading off to bed.  One packet was just sufficient when steeped in boiling water in a standard sized mug.<br /><br />Best tea I've ever had, although I'm sure I'll experience more enjoyable ones in the future.  But I have a feeling this one is going to be steady in the tea rotation at my home.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/text: I purchased Smart Basics Aloe Vera juice directly through Vitacost. Usually I purchase Lily of The Desert brand Aloe Vera Juice and mostly through Vitacost. This brand, Smart Basics however does not include citric acid in their ingredients label BUT it is there. This juice is very tangy. Lily of The Desert uses citric acid to help stabilize their organic Aloe Vera juice but in smaller quantities. Smart Basics is a decent aloe vera juice but the very fact that this brand does not honestly list the citric acid and uses a higher percentage is enough reason to switch back to Lily Of The Desert.

review/text: I love Harney & Son's Fine teas.  My favorite is their hot cinnamon spice black tea.  I've been looking for the perfect green tea.  This one's pretty good.  I found that these are easy to not oversteep.  The short string and wide satchel is great for that.  The bag smells really fresh and the tea is tightly rolled.  It's memorizing to watch the tea expand and fill the entire satchel.<br />As for the taste, it's medium-medium/bold, which is nice for a green tea.  It wasn't too light and it was flavorful enough, I just wish it had a little bit of extra something.  It was very soothing and smooth with sugar.

Open the bag, 10 seconds in the microwave, and 1st breakfast is good to go....While obviously not health food, not a terrible thing to give a kid for breakfast.<br /><br />As always, Amazon always delivers everything on time and well packaged.

review/summary: Picture very misleading
review/text: I love these Oatmeal to Go bars and have had a hard time finding them in the stores lately.  I was thrilled to find them available online.  The problem with this item is the picture.  If you are familiar with the product line, the green box shown is the "kids" size, featuring 9 bars which are smaller than the regular size. The picture displays the smaller size bars and the box says 9 in the lower corner. Nowhere in the description did it say the number of bars in the box so I assumed by the picture that it was 9 of the smaller bars.  When my order arrived it was a pack of 6 boxes of the larger bars in the red boxes.  Not what I expected and not what I wanted. Too many calories per bar when you're watching your weight.

review/text: While this tea is good, its name promised more than the flavor delivered, at least the way I prepared it (steeped as a black tea). I only use a teaspoon of Splenda and no milk in my tea. If you use milk you may enjoy the tea more than I. At any rate, the tea was disappointing to me.<br /><br />Stash's chocolate hazelnut is more satisfying if it's chocolate one craves.<br /><br />While this tea was below my expectations, Talbott's Chelsea Morning Blend exceeded my hopes!

review/summary: This is the stuff!
review/text: Ever since I tried coffee in a Turkish restaurant, I have been trying to replicate it at home. It is stronger than espresso, but without the bitterness. I tried getting the finest grind at the store, but I was still getting a bitter coffee, with little froth. Then, a friend recommended this one.<br /><br />The coffee is amazing! It starts out with a light colored froth that eventually turns to a darker colour, and the taste is just like I remember. If you want to get authentic Turkish coffee, this is the stuff to buy! Don't waste your time trying to grind it at the store - it won't be the same. The only alternative is to get a burr mill, and grind it yourself. Unfortunately, I don't have time for that.<br /><br />How I make it: Take cold filtered water, and use coffee cups to measure out water into the cezve. Then, add 1 level teaspoon of sugar for each coffee cup. Finally, add 1 heaping teaspoon of coffee for each cup. Set on a light-medium flame, and start stirring. Stir until you can't feel any resistance with the spoon (about 2 minutes), which means that the grounds are completely suspended, and sugar is dissolved. Froth will now be on the surface. As the coffee heats up, the froth will start to rise around the edges. Wait until the portion of the froth that has risen is about 1/3 to 1/2 of the total area - this is the most critical time point! Immediately take the cezve off the flame, and pour a little into each cup so that there is equal amount of froth. At this point, you can either split the coffee between the cups, or thoroughly stir it, and put it on the flame again until the froth starts to rise. The latter will give additional flavour, but will add some bitterness.<br /><br />Edit: Still using this stuff, and still have not found a better alternative. Most crucial point about preparation: DO NOT ALLOW THE COFFEE TO BOIL!!! Rising froth = good! Large bubbles coming up through the froth = BAD! Ideally, take the cezve off the flame just before any large bubble appears, and you will not have bitterness.

review/summary: Best Coffee Ever
review/text: I was in Istanbul last year and discovered the wonders of smooth, full-bodied Turkish coffee.  In my haste, I brought only one package back that I found at the Spice Market.  Once we tasted the coffee; we loved it.  Better than anything in the US.  As you can expect, we finished the small package very quickly so I decided to research the product and found it on the Internet.  It's the exact coffee from Istanbul!  Bought 3 canisters and have been so enjoying it.  The benefits -- I am allergic to caffein but have no problems with this coffee (though it is caffinated).  I have served it to many people including others who stay away from caffein and they have all enjoyed it as well.<br />This coffee is so smooth and flavorful and I am very picky about coffee especially when it's bitter (ugh).  It's a great product and I am glad there is a US importer for it.

review/text: This is the real thing, from Istanbul.  If you like Turkish coffee (Doesn't everyone?), you owe it to yourself to thy this brand.  The cans are nice because they keep the product fresh, and you can use them later to store coffee beans.  Coffee note:  not all "Turkish" coffee is the same.  The Greek and Turkish methods of roasting are less bitter then Lebanese or Egyptian roasting, in my opinion.

This is smooth and has that crunchcy, yet  'melt in your mouth' quality of the regular Almond Roca. If you like the regular but cannot tolerate sugar, then I highly reccomend this sugar free version! The only problem I have here is the outrageous shipping price. Try to find it local if you can.

It has a sweet/sour taste which is really refreshing, especially when applying a citrus sugar around the rim of the glass first.  The directions on the bottle, however, indicate 2 parts mix to 1 part vodka.  We prefer the recipe of 1 part mix to 1 part vodka, which works out perfectly.  If you like Appletinis, I think you'll love this mix - enjoy!

I think I'm ordering the entire collection of flavors to have in the liquor cabinet for guests.  I bet strawberry mixed with rum and ice and some fresh strawberries would make the most amazing daquari!

review/text: I first tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JR2PBC">Galil Green Manz Olive 12-15 + 20% Extra, 22.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a> and loved them.  Although these pitted ones cost about a dollar more, I thought it'd be nice to have a stash of them on hand for those times I want to use olives in a dish (since the others contain pits).  Unfortunately, the shipped package, which had a couple other small items in it, arrived totally beat up. One end of the shipping box had been completely ripped open and then taped shut. Inside, the olives cans were all dented but one.  Weirdest of all, a roll of toilet paper was stuck inside the box too. No, I had not ordered any toilet paper; all I can figure is somewhere along the way, perhaps when the box had busted open because the olives weren't properly immobilized by Amazon, somebody thought to use the roll as packing material.  Nice. [insert eye roll]<br /><br />The salvaged good can? Wonderful! These olives are just grand, so fresh, with good texture, not mushy at all.  I like to rinse them in water before use, to cut down on the salt.<br /><br />Amazon is replacing the olives.  The promised one-day shipping has turned into a week, so I will post an edit when they arrive.  I am hoping since no other reviewer mentioned dented cans as a problem, that maybe my experience was a fluke.<br /><br />EDIT: 3 of 6 cans in the replacement order, which was packaged much better, had dents, two significant enough to throw out (dents near seams are considered particularly hazardous in canned goods).  This time it looked like dents were in the cans *before* shipping.  Disappointing.
