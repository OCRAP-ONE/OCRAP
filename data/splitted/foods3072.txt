review/summary: "The Real Thing"... Alive and well and living in Mexico!
review/text: You know, I've been drinking Coke my entire life (50years), so when I first heard that you could still find original 1960's formula Coca Cola made with pure cane sugar vs. high fructose corn syrup, I was doubtful.  I had wondered if Coke was planning such an item after the success Pepsi has had with its "Throwback" line (As an aside, their Throwback Mountain Dew is amazing).  After discovering this product already existed south of the border, I immediately ordered a six-pack just to see if there was any difference.  The executives at CocaCola state there is no difference whatsoever in the taste of the two, and, well, while the great Coke taste is very similiar, the Mexican version has a much lighter, less syrupy aftertaste, which I would definitely prefer and could easily tell the difference in a blind taste test.  In conclusion, simply, if you love Coca Cola, do yourself a favor and order this version.  Now.  You won't be sorry.

review/summary: Is the price right? Yes!
review/text: My first inclination was that Mexican Coca-Cola costs too much money. I changed my mind one day when noticed what I was charged for a glass of coke with my lunch, $2.99.<br /><br />When you factor in tax and tip, you are looking at close to $4 for a drink of coke that came from a soda fountain and in no way compares to the taste of an ice-cold bottle of coke made with pure cane sugar produces.<br /><br />If you are (or know someone that is) a Coca-Cola lover, then you will find this a fine treat (or gift) that is well worth the price. Best savored when chilled slowly with fresh ice (if you can wait).<br /><br />Thanks

review/summary: $19.99 for a case at Home Depot
review/text: You can purchase a case of this for $19.99 plus sales tax at Home Depot.  They also have Fanta Orange for the same price.  I have also seen individual bottles at Publix Supermarket for $1.39.  Publix also has Mexican Sprite.<br /><br />The difference is sugar instead of corn syrup.  Sugar is better.  The US and Japan are the only countries in the world that use corn syrup instead of sugar.<br /><br />Many grocery items on Amazon aren't worth it for one simple reason.  They are not directly sold by Amazon.  They are sold by a third-party who also charges shipping.  People are looking to make a buck off of people who don't pay attention or don't research.  Many people don't know you can buy Mexican Coke at Home Depot or other local retailers.  Publix will order you as much Mexican Coke as you want and you may get a volume discount.<br /><br />I gave this two stars only because the price is absurd and because there are no other two star items.  The product is fine for sugar water.

review/summary: Takes me back to when I was a young Mexican boy working on the granja
review/text: Of course, back then everyone drank the good stuff. This was before the U.S. Government-sponsored sugar wars of the 1970s, leading the soft drink manufacturers to use cheaper high-fructose corn syrup instead. (+ History Lesson included below)<br /><br />It was never a taste or health decision, purely cost. Of course we now know there are other (long term) costs: HFCS probably has plenty to do with the frightening increase in obesity and diabetes in this country. (* recent Princeton study; see link in Comments)<br /><br />Coke's current U.S. offering isn't just bad FOR you. It tastes horrible, too. And despite official Coca-Cola comments to the contrary ("All of our consumer research indicates that from a taste standpoint, the difference is imperceptible"), anyone who has tasted both knows the difference. The suits in Atlanta have a vested interest in protecting their bottling partners on this side of the border. Their apparent failure at the taste test table thus becomes understandable if not acceptable.<br /><br />On the other side of the border, however, Mexican Coke still uses cane sugar, which translates to pure sweetness not to mention less aftertaste. Nice heavy glass bottles add to the appeal. Find these at your local carniceria or bodega, or even by the case at some Costco or Sam's Club locations.<br /><br />REFRESCO indeed!!!<br /><br />P.S. If you are unable to find Mexican Coke locally and unwilling to pay the shipping premium here, just keep your eyes open this Spring for the special Passover Coke, which also forgoes the corn syrup for good old fashioned (and Kosher!) sugar.<br /><br />[+ History Lesson follows]<br /><br />By the late 1970s, increasing tariffs on imported sugar forced U.S. food manufacturers to develop alternative sweeteners. The answer quickly became high-fructose corn syrup, the price of which continues to be kept low through government subsidies for corn growers. Damn the taste, we know what fat Americans with dead taste buds want!

review/summary: With this Price ,Are you Kidding??
review/text: I was on Amazon looking for a 'Natural Soda', one with a sweetener that wasn't white sugar and no phosphoric acid,when I saw the Mexican Coca Cola. First off if you loved Coke in the 60's & early 70's ,you will LOVE this coke. I know I do. But the REASON I gave it 2 stars is not for the taste of the Product- well that would be the reason for the taste . BUT WHOEVER is BUYNG at this price is seriously getting RIPPED OFF !!! Especially when you can go into your favourite Target store and buy it for $1.19 to $1.25 a bottle. And there are grocery stores here in the San Joaquin & Sacramento Valleys of California that sell it for those prices too. Such as SaveMart, S Mart, Food Maxx, It's not usually in the soda aisle either, all these guys make you look for it too, including Target. But it's worth it in taste. And I personally think that McDonald's burger joints also use this formulation in their taps, because it sure as heck doesn't taste the same as the coke in a Carl's burger place. Egads , now I'm taste testing for burger joint colas??!!!

review/text: There's nothing like a Coca-Cola with REAL sugar.  I live for Passover time when I can get Kosher Coke at the local supermarket, which also has real sugar.  For the in between times, I like to grab some Mexi-Coke.  It's so much better than the regular Coke that is readily available at my local supermarket.  If I didn't have a place close to my home where I could get it, I might consider paying the $21 here on Amazon.  But since I can go to Wegman's and get a whole case (24 bottles) for $1 LESS than it costs for the 6 bottles here, I'll pass.  5 Star product - 1 Star price.  (I split the difference with 3 stars for the review.)  If you don't have Wegman's near you, consider taking advantage of this offer.  If there's a Wegman's close to you, just go there and get a case.

In the meantime, anyone who has input, plz contribute!<br /><br />p.s. price is now $1.39@.  Freight and food costs continue to escalate.

review/summary: I was skeptical, but yes they work!
review/text: My background: I'm a working mom who exclusively breastfeeds.  I know my infant is receiving plenty of breastmilk when he nurses at home.  My downfall is pumping at work.  I only get 3 pump sessions with less than 15 minutes for each one.  I usually pump at work before I start, during my lunch break (and eat lunch at my desk) and about 2 hours before I drive home.  My commute is a bit more than an hour each way. I was struggling hard to fill four bottles of 4 oz of breastmilk a day that my son drinks.  Three for the daycare and one at home for my husband to use until I can make it home. We had just wiped out my barely there frozen supply and I was spending the weekends pumping like mad when my infant wasn't nursing to build that extra supply back up. I had been trying the Mother's Milk Herbal tea, which seemed to only give me the runs and cause massive gas in my infant.  I didn't appreciate running to the bathroom all the time, but my infant got a kick out of tooting all day with the tea.<br /><br />I can't remember where I read about the lactation cookies before, but I was getting at wits end, especially when I started to pump even LESS.  I guess since my son is at the 6 month mark, or my body might be trying to kick start ovulation, I don't know and it was driving me crazy.  I tried extending my sessions at work and taking hits on annual leave to pump enough.  My infant doesn't tolerate formula well and we didn't want to supplement him with the expensive formula, so I figured these cookies would be work a try.<br /><br />What to expect:  I started by eating two cookies a day.  Don't expect to eat one of these cookies and double your pump amount that evening.  I tried eating two cookies a day and by the end of the third day I had the 'man, my boobs really hurt' kinda sensation.  I was at home, not at work, so I let my son nursing and then successfully pumped an extra ounce after he was done.  I thought to myself 'damn, that was awesome'.  It was.  I now had some extra milk.  When work started, I noticed a slight increase.  I usually pump anywhere from 3-5oz a session.  When I ordered milkmakers cookies, I was leaning more towards pumping 3 oz a session and spending about 20 min with a Lactina double pump to do so.  It's now been almost a full week since I started having two cookies a day and now I'll be sitting at work and I know it's time to pump because I have the slight engorgement feeling, something I haven't had since the first few weeks of initially breastfeeding.  And, how do I say this without sounding crass....when I pump, more comes out faster....so instead of taking 20 minutes to just get 4 oz, in about 10 minutes I'm pretty much done pumping, even though I keep on going. My supply while pumping at work has gone from around 3 oz lately to just about 4 oz, and sometimes topping 5 oz again.<br /><br />The extra bonus is first thing in the morning when my infant falls back asleep after feeding I can manage to pump an additional 1-3 oz depending on how hungry he was when he nursed.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty darn impressed.  My husband even agrees the money toward the milkmaker cookies is worth it, and yes, he's tried a bite of a cookie and it's pretty tasty too.  We're not big fan of formula, so we figure the cost of a 1 month supply of cookies would cost the same as one and half canisters of the speciality formula we'd have to buy IF we went the formula route.<br /><br />I'm happy I can continue to breastfeed my son and I can pump enough at work each day to have bottles ready for him at daycare and when my husband picks him up.  I DO try and get my son to 'top up' before I drop him off in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside is the oatmeal and brewers yeast in these cookies gives me gas, but I'd rather have mild gas than the runs like the Herbal tea gave me.

review/summary: Tasty way to increase milk!
review/text: First off these cookies are very tasty!  I like that you can store them in your freezer and just take one out as needed.  I think the only problem is just eating one a day!! Of course I did that but I thought about my next cookie lol!!  So the real question is did they work for me.  Let me give you a little back story.  I've been nursing for about 21 months and my supply was really dwindling.  My little one wasn't happy about that though.  So I gave them a try and I was impressed with the increase!  Definitely  noticeable after about 3 days.  This was an easy way to boost supply rather than taking many supplements and such.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who needed a boost.<br /><br />**Disclaimer - I received a sample for review purposes.  As always my thoughts are my own.

review/text: Sometimes when my husband talks about his childhood and things he liked way back then - he mentions licorice allsorts.  So I was excited to be able to buy him some of these treats from Amazon.  Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed in the quality of the product.  The candy was stale and looked and tasted "old".  We picked out a few edible pieces and kept the rest in a tin for a while but then ended up throwing it out because we knew it would not be eaten.  Shortly afterwards I was in Home Goods and found very fresh and nicely packaged licorice allsorts for a great price.  We love Amazon and buy almost everything from this site - but the licorice allsorts were not a success.

The proportions were NOTHING like what is pictured.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to the nature of the product (frozen, stuffed) and the time it is traditionally served (Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner) you don't find out it is crap until it comes out of the oven... and by then you are stuck with it, because most of the stores are already closed.<br /><br />Despite the small amount of meat, it easily fed seven people, with ample left-overs... mainly because nobody finished what was on their plates, let alone went back for seconds.<br /><br />On a positive note, our dog loved the stuff and happily ate everything that was dumped into her bowl.

review/summary: The cats REALLY like these!
review/text: Having read the review about cats becoming addicted, I wondered if this had some kitty crack in it.  My cats enjoy them a great deal, but aren't obsessed although they do both follow me to the cat tree (where I give them treats) first thing in the morning.  They did that when I used to give them other treats, though too.  When given the choice between Friskies and these, they go for the Greenies.  I wish they were cheaper, but will continue to spend the extra money because it's clear that my felines appreciate it.  My cats give them TWO PAWS UP!

review/summary: Cats love these treats
review/text: I can attest personally that cats go nuts for these treats. I don't know what they put in them that makes cats love them so much, but my cats come running when they hear the bag open. I even had an indecent where my naughty cats stole a bag of them and tore it open, eating every last treat!! Of course now they're kept in the pantry where naughty kitties can't get them. As far as flavor goes they're a 5/5<br /><br />I can't attest for their dental benefits as of yet, but I'm using them for toothbrush training since they seem to love the treats and I love the added dental benefits (lol sounds like a kids cereal commercial)

review/text: I have two 3 year old cats one female (Luna) one male (Titan).... I used to buy crappy supermarket treats just to give them something different... We rarely give them treats... But a year ago my vet told me Luna might have dental issues in the future. Also, Titan gained a lot of weight.... I decided to look into something that would help Luna... I found these and bc of all the positive reviews i decided to give it a try... It's only been a couple of weeks but all i know is that they LOVE it... I'm hoping this is a better option health wise and dental wise.... :)

review/summary: Cat loves it, but I wish the size could be improved
review/text: The reason this stuff even gets 4 stars is because my cat absolutely loves these treats. They smell absolutely disgusting to me, so I wonder how they can possibly be improving her breath, but she likes them and they're a better option than giving her Temptations treats, so why not? Plus, a 6 ounce bag lasts several months, which is awesome for the price, especially since this is a by-product/animal digest free treat.<br /><br />Now, here are my problems with these:<br /><br />When my cat was younger and smaller, she used to actually chew them, so I figured they might potentially be doing something for her teeth. Now that she is bigger, she just swallows them whole. If these treats were a little larger, then perhaps she would be compelled to actually chew them. I see how it's a tricky matter to make them a size that the cat will actually chew and not choke on, but I do worry about her choking on these. Also, they obviously aren't doing anything for her teeth if she doesn't even chew em, so yeah, that's my main complaint. Apart from that, I wish they didn't smell so horrible, and I wish they didn't have corn in them, but since they're just a treat, I figure a few junk ingredients are allowed, as long as they aren't by-products.

review/summary: decent, but not as "dental" as I expected
review/text: I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. Also the only breath freshening ingredients- rosemary and chlorophyll, are at the very tail end of the ingredient list as dead last and third to last. I am glad that these ingredients are present, but they are in such small quantities, that they can't be helping much. From personal experience, I have not noticed and breath freshening results. I think the only reason why they are "dental" treats is because of the small amount of rosemary and chlorophyll as well as the fact that they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. If your looking for a real dental treat I would recommend Crunch n' Clean with DentaShield. However, this is still a MUCH better treat than Pounce brand or Meow Mix or any soft treat that can have soft sticky particles that will stay stuck to your cats teeth and smell bad and cause dental problems. This treat may not help teeth significantly, but they definitely won't hurt them and probably do some good; just not as much as I expected for the price. Also there are tuns of vitamin in these, which is pretty cool. They really are pretty decent treats, and I would probably give them 4 stars if they were just treats. However, to be marketing them as "dental," they really should have enzymes or more prevalent dental ingredient.

review/text: This tea was recommended by Dr. Oz and by weight loss doctor Medina Jampolis. Dr. Melina said to drink 2-3 cups of it a day, or maybe she said that SHE does that; I bought some from amazon.com and didn't really like the taste.  But it's grown on me and now, 3 months-or-so later, I truly ENJOY a cup or two a day! I wish I could report that I've lost weight, but I can't, although i haven't GAINED any, even tho' I'm getting more exercise (muscle weighs more than fat, drink tea some times when i'd otherwise have an unhealthy snack, and I'm in my 60's and don't walk independently due to MS, so weight loss is harder anyway. I'm still hopeful.  But this tea is my friend and definitely not working against me! Got to order more of it again.  Will buy from the same source--right here.

I pulled the trigger and ordered a couple jars. The price is reasonable, but the shipping was a little higher than what I would consider fair. However, my biggest complaint....there is no instructions on how to keep your hand out of the jar. These things are "TOTALLY AWESOME".Definitly a 5 star product. Just wish they could do something about the shipping cost. We will buy again ... even with the high cost of shipping AAA

These little spicy dandies are not your usual tube meat purchased in the local gas station deli, NO!  They are well made, and have lots more flavor than I have ever experienced in a red hot.  If you are in to the pickled proteins, give the eggs a shot too, they are a wonderful quick and healthy snack.

review/summary: Decent coffee, oversized pods
review/text: These Mega Pods are 1.5x the size of a normal pod.  As such, they don't fit in a single pod holder, and you can't put two in a double pod holder.  Only option is to put a single pod in a double pod holder and then manually control your brewing time to get the flavor you want.  Either run a single pod cycle and get strong coffee, run a double pod cycle to get OK coffee, or press the OFF button at approximately 1.5x brewing time to get good coffee.<br /><br />Another problem I encountered is that the pod paper seems to be somewhat resistant to getting wet.  Since the pod fits loosely in a double pod holder, the hot water has an opportunity to bypass the pod for several seconds before finally wetting the paper and then getting into contact with the coffee.  When this happens, you get foamy white water for a while and lousy coffee.  I was able to overcome this problem by first wetting both sides of the pod with tap water and then pressing the pod into the holder.  By doing so, I was able to get a good looking stream of dark foamy coffee coming out at the start of the brew cycle, as it is supposed to be.<br /><br />The flavor is decent, but it is easy to get better flavor by making my own pods with the Perfect Pod unit and pod filter papers.  I only use these Baronet pods as a backup option when I have run out of my home-made pods.  Since these pods are individually wrapped, I don't have to worry about the other pods losing their flavor once the box has been opened.

Still edible, but oh, so annoying.  Had the cookies been packed or shipped to avoid damage I would have given this product 5 stars for their excellent flavor (mild peanut butter, good chocolate wallop) and sweet tooth satisfaction.

review/summary: Love Peanut Butter Cookies?
review/text: If you do not eat gluten, and you love peanut butter cookies, you HAVE to try these cookies! They are so superly delicious! They are somewhat crumbly in the box, and at least one cookie in every box will be broken into pieces. But they are so good you will not even care! Definitely try them, you'll love them.

review/summary: Tasty but Dry
review/text: I enjoyed the flavor of these but they were a bit dry and therefore very crumbly. The flavor reminds me of the peanut butter cookies my mom used to make with the Hershey's Kiss on top. I have a whole package so I may try microwaving the cookie for a few seconds to see if the crumbliness and dryness disappear. Will report back when I do.

review/summary: How the cookie crumbles.
review/text: These cookies are gluten and wheat free, but do contain dairy products. They are very good for the kind of snack that they are. I find them a little dry and out of three boxes, (they come as 12 packs of two cookies in a box,) only the first came with the cookies intact. A lot of them were almost all crumble with very little cookie. But if you need to stay gluten free, then you would probably enjoy them anyhow.

review/summary: Was: Whole Cookies! Now: Still arrive as mostly crumbs
review/text: Update 5/19/12: Enough of the crumbs already. Guess Pamela's has no interest in fixing the production. I'm canceling, there are better cookies.<br /><br />Update 3/20/12: My latest shipment arrived with no damage to the box, but some of the cookies were completely reduced to crumbs. Odd thing is in some cases a single 2-pack would have a whole or nearly whole cookie, and the other was totally crumbs. The manufacturer's production quality must be inconsistent, and it just takes a certain amount of shipment vibration to crumble the 'weaker' cookies. Odd thing is this is the first batch I've had that were so thoroughly reduced to tiny crumbs. Pamela's needs to tweak their manufacturing.<br /><br />Update 11/7/11: Ditto. Great product arrives intact. Keep shipping them in the display pack via USPS.<br /><br />Update 10/9/11: Ordered the 12 pack of 2 packs again, arrived in the same shelf display package, with intact cookies. Keep it up Amazon, this is working.<br /><br />Update 10/1/11: I took a chance and ordered another package. This one came in a long 'shelf display package', which was shipped USPS. If they stick to this packaging and shipping, I'll order these cookies regularly. So far every 2-pack has had whole complete cookies with minimal crumbs. Way to go, Amazon! I'll attach a picture under the 'customer pics'.<br /><br />Update 9/26/11: a second attempt resulted in larger cookie pieces, and one of the packages contained two whole complete cookies<br /><br />Original review: The 12 pack of 2-packs was delivered in a plastic bag. They must travel around Amazon in this fashion, and are reduced to crumbles as handled by Amazon. The bag was packaged in a large box along with a 6-pack of cereal boxes; there could have been more filler around the cookies bag, but I doubt it would help much if the cookie bag is tumbling around Amazon before shipment packaging.<br /><br />The cookies themselves were okay, not as good as nutter-butters. Can't really judge them as cookies when most all of them were broken. There were a few almost 'halves', but they were coated in crumbs. Some of the packages had melted chocolate. Basically you have to pour the packages out into a bowl and eat them with a spoon. I agree with the last reviewer, except, I'm willing to reorder in the future if Amazon can send a replacement shipment that arrives mostly or all intact.

review/summary: Tasty but Crumbly - Eat them with a spoon!
review/text: Like many have said, these cookies are really tasty.  I love the flavor.  I'm only rating 3 stars because I got six boxes and every box had approximately 75% of the cookies broken/crumbled.  The recipe abviously needs to be tweaked.  That being said, I too find it difficult to not eat a whole box in one sitting.  I eat them with a spoon! They'd probably be very good sprinkled over vanilla ice cream - gotta try that.  I love the flavor of these cookies, but hope that Pamela's fixes the recipe so they don't crumble in transit (or upon the first bite if you are lucky enough to get a cookie that is completely intact). I've tried several of Pamela's cookies and this is the only one that was COA (crumbs on arrival) :-)

review/summary: Surprisingly Yummy Cookies
review/text: To be fair, I should say that I haven't ordered these cookies from Amazon.com yet, so I can't speak for the condition they arrive in. I sampled them recently and was looking for an online source for family in another state.<br /><br />In any case, the cookies I tried were surprisingly delicious! I picked up a sample packet at a local health food store, and didn't have high expectations. I bake the vast majority of my own goodies, I'm a very experienced baker, and I don't normally eat gluten-free products. I was happily surprised to find that these had a good peanutty flavor, pleasantly crumbly texture, and lots of little chocolate chips. Unfortunately, I think that the crumbly texture is probably what makes these less than ideal for loose shipping.

review/summary: Beautifully Handcrafted Piece
review/text: This bowl arrived quickly, but it was safely packed inside an attractive box. The glaze is a very reflective black with a single, subtle cloud-like accent mark for character. I was drying the bowl upside down today and noticed a seashell-like design at the bottom which may indicate who made the piece or it may just be a nice flourish. It's really amazing the quality that went into the piece for this price, my bowl is just as perfectly crafted as the one in the picture. If you zoom in on the picture you can really see the quality of the glaze, it's especially evident in the blue-cream accent mark but also the perfectly smooth piece as a whole. A handmade piece like this never depreciates in price and would cost much more if purchased at a retail store, that's why it would make an excellent gift for anyone interested in tea, Japan, pottery, or just quality housewares.

review/text: This bowl is perfect for "Summer" use of Matcha. The tea does cool faster because it is a Summer bowl. The colors are Black, Brown, with a flash of Blue and Yellow.<br />I have made matcha daily in this bowl since I've received it. It is easy to wisk the tea because the interior is smooth without seams to "trap" the tea. It would be useful for a small bowl of oatmeal, grits, rice, or miso soup -- if someone was so inclined. It arrived very well packed and protected. Nice design, handling ability, and price. It appears to be made in Japan evidenced by the package (box) and the wrapping paper inside the box. All my Japanese made items come wrapped in this type of paper.

review/summary: Pretty to look at , not all that I expected
review/text: My first bowl arrived in March, well packaged and I was very excited to open the box. To my surprise, the DoMatcha Handcrafted Bowl was smaller than I had anticipated. I have seen others that hold more, making the whisking process easier, which avoids spills over the side. It would have been helpful to have the capacity available, before ordering.The bowl is very pretty and does look exactly like the photo. My only concern was with the lack of smooth glazing around the top edge of the bowl. Running my finger along the edge gave me concern about drinking from a surface that appeared sharp to the touch. I checked to see if the bowl could be returned. Unfortunately it could not, so I called Amazon customer service for assistance. They confirmed that the bowl could not be returned however they would send me another as a replacement. The second bowl arrived promptly within the week. I am very sad to report that the second bowl is exactly the same as the first. Same feel to the top edge of the bowl. This makes me wonder how mass produced these bowls are. So now I have two bowls which I will most likely use for mixing and not drinking. I guess I expected better quality for the price of this bowl.

review/summary: Very good.  Pricey.
review/text: I ordered this Hevla low acid coffee, Puroast and HealthWise to compare.  All three of them taste good.  The HealthWise has the coarsest grind, this Hevla one is the middle grind and the Puroast is the fine grind.  With taste being pretty equal, the Hevla came out to be the most expensive at approximately 1.79 per ounce, the HealthWise at .87 per ounce, and the Puroast at .50 per ounce.  Some people may find taste differences, but we just thought they all tasted like coffee.  So with all other things being equal, we will probably stick to the Puroast and the HealthWise since the Hevla is twice as much as the Healthwise and more than three times as much as the Puroast.  I will note that customer service with the Hevla is more frequent and personal, so if that is a very important factor to you, then that is actually what you are paying for. Absolutely nothing negative about the coffee itself; just the cost if  you use it daily.

review/summary: Great cookies
review/text: I got the idea to purchase these cookies after watching the CNBC show "How I made my millions". I figured that anybody able to make a fortune from selling cookies out of Long Island probably makes some really good cookies. These cookies do not disappoint. My favorite are the white chocolate chip & macademia nut. Although the oatmeal raisin are a close second. The only thing I wished is for these to come individually wrapped inside each box, as opposed to the 7 unit celophane pack. When you open one pack, you have to commit to eating all 7 within a few days, since the cookies will lose their crispness after that.
