review/summary: Nutiva Coconut Oil
review/text: After learnging the benefits of coconut oil, I decided to give it a try.  While I was shopping at GNC store, I was very excited to see the coconut oil on their shelves.  I purchased a jar, but when I tried it... that's a diffrent story.  The taste was making me want to throw up.  Instead of giving up on it, each time I would take a spoonfull, I would pull my tongue in and hold my breath, so that I couldn't smell or taste it.  Well, after one week I decided to check amazon and I found out that Nutivia had the best reviews and I went ahead and ordered it (ordered it from Nutivia website as it was a little cheaper).  What a difference ! ! ! This coconut oil is amazing... It looks, smells, and tastes so fresh.  I just started to do oil pulling [...] and I found the best benefits with coconut oil. I would recommend this product to everyone !!!

review/summary: Nutritional Super Food!
review/text: This is 100% organic, unrefined coconut oil.  Yes, it tastes like coconut, but it is supose to.  A food should taste like what it is!<br /><br />The nutritional value of this food is outstanding.  It contains a lot of lauric acid which is also found in mothers milk and is both antifungal and antimicrobial.  It is stable at room temperature and does not become rancid quickly like other popular cooking oils.  It requires very high heat to release free radicals (I do prefer red palm oil for high heat cooking options because it does not release free radicals at all).<br /><br />My Suggested Uses:  smoothies, slow cooked baked goods, sauteed foods, mixed with maple syrup over popcorn, homemade cosmetics, and as an occasional conditioner for dry ends of long hair.

review/summary: COMPARISON REVIEW to Nature's Way
review/text: When I learned about the many benefits and uses of coconut oil I had to try it, so I ordered 2 jars -one for my pantry for cooking/smoothies etc. and one for my bathroom to use as a body cream. Since I didn't know what brand to choose and didn't have any prior experience with coconut oil I decided to get one jar of the NUTIVA brand and one jar of the NATURE'S WAY brand.<br /><br />Here's my initial opinion of both: With my Nutiva jar there's a sticker indicating the expiration date and package/creation date of the actual oil, whereas with my Nature's Way jar there's nothing like that. When I opened both of them up to try and to just generally check them out I tasted a tiny amount of both and it was very clear that the Nutiva jar's coconut oil tasted much better. I'm not sure exactly why, but to me the Nature's Way coconut oil didn't taste as good, it was kind of toasty in a bad way.<br /><br />It was very easy for me to decide to use the Nutiva brand coconut oil for my cooking and in my smoothies and the Nature's Way coconut oil for my skin. I've since read that this difference in taste could be because the Nutiva brand coconut oil was fresher and the Nature's Way older. Or it could be quality, I'm really not sure. But I am sure that from now on I'm going to just be buying the Nutiva brand Coconut Oil (just ordered 2 more big jars of it). :)<br /><br />To say that the Nature's Way coconut oil was toasty still isn't exactly the right word -toasty sounds like something good... when it's so not, but I really can't think of a better word to describe the difference.<br /><br />I've found a lot of uses for coconut oil and have used it for many things with great results so far. It's hard to believe one little oil can do so much! Weird actually, but everything I've tried it with so far has had positive results.<br /><br />So here's a list of weird, random, but completely amazing things I've found coconut oil to do:<br /><br />-Works better than any make-up remover: seriously, just use a nickle size amount or less on your eyes to get all eye make-up off in a flash.<br /><br />-Helps clear up acne: One night after using it to take off my eye make-up I decided to use it as an all over face make-up remover... then decided my face felt so good I didn't want to use anything else (hint: leave the coconut oil on your face for a minute and then get your water and washcloth really really hot to wipe it all away). I googled to see if this was okay to do and it turns out coconut oil can help get rid of acne! You can use it as a facewash. Strange but true. BUT I also found out that Castor Oil works even better for this (and like coconut oil still moisturizes your face and keeps it from drying out), so I've ordered a small bottle of that to use instead in the future... but still, coconut oil has worked really well for me and apparently others. When you have skin like mine (I'm 25) that occassionally breaks out but still is a little dry sometimes it's hard finding the right balance and exactly the right thing to use -I feel like now I've figured out some great secret to getting it right.<br /><br />-You can use it as a deoderant: This one I read online and decided to try on a day where I wasn't really doing anything or working out. It felt weird -like I was putting some kind of lotion or body creme under my arms instead of my normal Secret deoderant. But guess what? It worked! I have since been trying it on days where I actually do work out and it STILL is working. Craziness! It keeps me dry and smelling good the same as my old deoderant did. AND there's no aluminum zirconium (have no idea how to spell that correctly) which I know is now supposedly bad for you (most deoderants still use it though) because it's connected/correlated with Alzheimers. So... an all natural, organic, one ingredient deoderant that feels like a body creme -doesn't get much better than that! Plus my underarms are looking softer/nicer. :)<br /><br />-You can use it on your scalp and hair: Now I've tried this several times and although I DO like the way it moisturizes my hair, I don't like the way my hair looks after I wash it out... it's just kind of lanky/heavy. Not in an extreme way or anything, but I like my hair to have lots of body. So while I do recommend coconut oil to help heal frazzled hair and stimulate hair growth I don't recommend doing it right before any big event in your life... maybe like a few days before so you get the benefit of the moisturized, healthy hair, without any worries about styling it. This is another one where I've looked it up and found that Castor Oil when massaged in the scalp can stimulate hair growth/fast hair growth even better -so now that I've got that bottle on the way to me from amazon I'll probably be using that instead, at least on my scalp.<br /><br />-You can use it as a body creme and even a BODY WASH. Yepp. A body WASH. Sounds crazy, but it makes my skin look SO good. Better than it's ever looked actually. Coconut oil has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties (and of course is moisturizing) and will clean your skin while hydrating it. So no harsh chemicals or detergents touch your skin -and if you have sensitive skin like I do, well this stuff might just be your new best friend, must-have, can't live without it ever, stuff! I used to have a minor skin problem on my arms that I absolutely hated. Just general redness, sensitivity, and tiny little red dots on the tops of my arms (that I've had since childhood). Now I absolutely don't -and it's literally all because of coconut oil. Maybe it's because I'm not putting soaps/bodywash on my skin anymore or maybe it's because coconut oil is really that awesome, but it has basically cured my arms and has made the skin all over my body look amazing! I seriously can't believe how good it makes my skin look! The best thing to do is to literally use it like a body wash all over -rinse off and then either just towel dry and go or towel dry and then reapply again if your skin is dry or it's winter or you live in a dry climate. When you reapply you're going to have to have some kind of small towel to wipe off excess with before you put on clothes. Either way it makes your skin look great. :) You can also use it to shave with apparently but I haven't tried that. I'm using it to make my own homemade body scrubs and of course using it as a body creme and loving it!<br /><br />-You can feed it to your dogs (one tablespoon a day) to make their coats shiny. (I've been giving it to both my dogs, although not every single day and they love it.<br /><br />-It can help you lose weight. Apparently it has a lot of really GOOD for you fats that your body doesn't treat like other fats and it actually helps you lose weight (learned this from Dr. Oz). Plus it tastes good when you cook with it and put it in smoothies. Actually I LOVE it in smoothies, it just adds an extra tropical coconut flavor. :-)<br /><br />-You can use it for Oil Pulling.<br /><br />-You can use it as a lip balm.<br /><br />Plus I know there's so much more but that's all I can think of right now! Basically it's really good stuff that I am now believing everyone should have in their home! :-)

review/summary: BEST FLAVOR; BEST PRICES; ALWAYS FRESH
review/text: I've been using the Nutiva brand for 2 years now.  It has the best flavor of any of the brands in the nutrition and grocery stores.  When I used the other brands I rarely used the coconut oil.  They smelled and tasted yucky.  Plus I found out they were processed.  Nutiva is raw.  I have completely thrown out shortening; butter; and probably cut back at least half on the olive oil I used.<br />My chronically dry skin is gone without lotions.  I use it on toast or bread as a snack and I feel full and satisfied for hours. And I have seen a lot less water retention all over....not so puffy.  Wish I could say I lost weight or inches, but no, I didn't.  I have heard of others losing as soon as they start switching to coconut oil.  When I bake with it instead of shortening or butter...everything is so moist...no coconut flavor added to anything either.

review/summary: Superior product!
review/text: I have just recently begun using VCO for nearly all of my cooking.  After purchasing two books on the benefits of coconut oil, I have purchased several different brands of oil.  The Nutiva Organic EVCO is by far a superior oil with a delightful flavor.  The price from Amazon if you are a Prime member is the best I have found for this quality of oil.<br /><br />I began eating the oil mixed in about 1/2 cup of cottage cheese because I read on a forum that cottage cheese has properties which help the body assimilate the oil.  Since then I have expanded to many other uses.  I use the oil to sautee garlic, onions, peppers, etc for all of my soups and stir frys.  I spread it on toast and add it to my corn bread.<br /><br />In just the first week of eating coconut oil regularly I noticed that my chronic aches in my joints and muscles subsided.  My skin is smoother and blemishes began to disappear.  I began using it as a topical ointment on my hands, feet and face along with knees and elbows.  It is a much better skin conditioner than almost anything else I have used.<br /><br />I found that it also works great as a conditioner for all of my wooden cooking utensils and I rub it into my cutting boards to condition them.  It is far superior to mineral oil!<br /><br />I have introduced the oil into my husband's diet also.  He has been a Type II diabetic for about 15 years and just turned 77.  He is beginning to notice positive benefits also.  He particularly has noticed more mental acuity.  He adds the oil to his morning cereal and spreads it on his toast and really enjoys the flavor.<br /><br />I am so happy to have found this wonderful Nutiva oil and appreciate its many benefits.  I find it kind of addictive.  I now look forward to adding the oil to more and more foods and it seems to make nearly everything, including eggs, soups, stews, casseroles, muffins and breads more delicious.  I highly recommend the Nutiva brand of Organic EVCO for a huge variety of uses.  To those who think it has too much coconut flavor - well, I guess you can't please everyone.  Try it and decide for yourself.  The health benefits are worth it!  This oil has given me a new energy and improved my health so positively that I would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />The only downside I can mention is the plastic container.  It would be better if it were packaged in glass, but hopefully all those anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties of the oil will negate the use of a plastic container ;-)

review/summary: Lovely Product for Hair and Skin!
review/text: I must admit I haven't tried cooking with this oil yet, but I'm certainly looking forward to it.  Instead, my review will focus on using Nutiva Organic Coocnut oil as a beautifying product.  I bought the 54-ounce jar for using on my hair and skin.  So here's what I think of it as part of a beauty/skincare/haircare regime.<br /><br />This is a fantastic product at a great price.  Sure, you could get a jar of coconut oil at the grocery store but it's quality wouldn't compare to Nutiva coconut oil which is food quality, organic, cold-pressed, and unrefined.  I was so excited when this product arrived that I tried it out immediately.  The first thing I noticed was the lovely smell.  The product smells good enough to eat straight out of the container and I admit I did taste a bit while applying it to my skin and hair.  My other observation is that it melts so easily in the hands and applies so well to both hair and skin.  My less expensive, refined Superdrug coconut oil cannot compare to Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil.  The cheaper coconut oils have hard, white bits in them and do not smell like actual coconut.  Nutiva is smooth/silky and melts easily in the hands without leaving behind white balls/clumps that the cheaper refined coconut oils have.  I love Nutiva so much that I emptied all my cheap Superdrug coconut oil into the rubbish bin and scooped some Nutiva Coconut oil into the little Superdrug canister and put it in my bathroom for easy access.  I am using Nutiva a few times a week on my body and hair.  Before bed, I scoop some Nutiva onto my hands and rub my hands together causing it to melt.  It melts quickly and I rub it onto my skin and hair (can be applied to wet, damp, or dry hair easily).  I saturate my hair with it and use a shower cap to do an overnight heavy oiling treatment.  In the morning I shower as normal and shampoo or condition it out using a clarifying conditioner.  This creates beautifully silky, shiny hair and skin! There are so many benefits to the body using this oil.  I highly recommend it and hope that it will always be sold on Amazon.

review/text: I have been studying the benefits of coconut oil for some time. I tried several different brands but when I opened a jar of the Nutiva I knew that I had found what I was looking for. Absolutely the freshest most wonderful organic virgin coconut oil on the planet.<br /><br />I substituted the butter and/or vegetable oil in several recipes with the Nutiva coconut oil and achieved incredible results. I even fried eggs in it last night and they were GREAT! I will never fry with any other oil again. I also use it as a spread on toast, bagels, and muffins.<br /><br />AAAAA+++++  Try it, you'll love it!

review/summary: Very pleased so far
review/text: Aside from digestive issues, I have suffered from adult acne in recent years. I have noticed a correlation between stress and breakouts (and that familiar female response once a month) however I have not yet found a complete system which had worked to eliminate my acne.<br />After reading of coconut oil and Lauric acid, I have put it on trial... and have thus far experienced some impressive results..! It took about 8 days before I noticed the large cysts subsiding, and they have stayed away now for several weeks. Even my monthly cyst is keeping in check. Who would have thought rubbing your face with coconut oil twice and day and taking it internally would make the oily patches on your face actually improve? It seemed a little counter-intuitive, but so far I am experiencing some very clear skin... for the first time in years... Of course, I believe in coupling the outside assault with an internal one, so I have been taking the coconut oil daily (usually on bread or I just add it to cereal) as well as a wonderful greens mix (powder) and a pro-biotic. Of course, water is paramount, and I drink plenty every day, but I always did... Finding your balance is the most important thing - what is right for some is not always right for all - I will report back in a few months to let you know if the coconut oil has continued to impress me.

review/summary: Best Coconut Oil there is!!!
review/text: Best coconut oil ever!!!! I have used other brand of coconut oil like Vitamin shoppe but this one is different. Just the smell alone when you open the bottle.  The aroma of pure coconut smells my entire living room...<br /><br />First of all, this is a huge bottle---- 54 oz!!! Even our local Vitamin Shoppe does not carry this size in their store.<br /><br />I used this mainly because of my flaky, dry skin....right after taking a shower when your pores are still open is the best time to apply this all over...even your face. I live in Chicago and during the cold season- nothing really works for my skin but this product.<br /><br />I am familiar with coconut oil since i was born and grew up in the Philippines where this product may have originated.  We used it for everything including cooking.<br /><br />I also use this in my hair after i take a shower. makes my hair feels silky.  I also used this for back massage and to relieve muscle pain....<br /><br />It's really great to have coconut oil in your house because of its plenty of uses!!! The price here at Amazon is unbelievable!!! and with free shipping as well....Highly Recommended!!!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Well i finally trash my body lotions and use this instead as body lotion.  Winter here in Chicago can be so brutal that my whole body itches for days.  Best when use right after taking a shower.  I still use my Vanicreme as hand lotion.

review/text: I was very happy with this purchase. I read all the positive reviews and I have to agree with most of them. The coconut oil tastes delicious, I kind of want to eat out of the jar- I'm not sure I can say this about any other oil haha. I spread the solid form a litte bit on some crackers to try it and it was delicious, I used it on some banana bread in place of regular butter- delicious. I haven't really noticed the flavor in any of the foods I cook. I made sauteed spinach and chicken nuggets. I actually fried the chicken nuggets and I think they came out quite well actually. I could go on, but overall I am very happy with this product and it is definitly money well spent.<br /><br />The only down side is I just got it on Saturday and less than a week later I already used half a jar- so my law student budget might be streched a little thin. It would be nice also to see if the claims that it helps you loose weight are true. I'll post an update if it helps since I have been trying to drop from a size 4 to a size 2 for forever and a day.

review/text: This coconut oil tastes great. It has lots of health benefits and is easy to use in baked goods. I don't like the coconut flavor in savory foods, but that's just me. I always buy this coconut oil because of the great quality and price.

review/text: Works just like regular oil. If its as healthy a they say then thats a plus. You can use this stuff in place of any oil. It has a nice light sweet coconut smell. You can also use it as a spread on bread. I enjoy using it knowing that its healthier than canola or vegetable oil.

review/text: I purchased this item because coconut oil is believed to help lower cholesterol.  While I've not had sufficient time to find out if this is true, it is a great product to cook with, great flavor and food does not taste like it's laden with grease nor does it retain a coconut flavor in cooking.  Good product.

However was hesitant when it came to putting it on your skin for moisturizer etc.. After trying I must say it works great. I thought it would be greasy but really its not. Plus the smell is great. The other day my sisters dog was spelling my head for ever. I thought it was so funny. Anyways this product is great and it has a nice subtle taste to it as well. Works great for anything including greasing a pan for eggs to making Thai dishes. You name it.. you can use this product.

review/summary: Best Tasting Coconut Oil I've tried!
review/text: I have ordered and used several big name coconut oils and this is the first one I have been able to eat straight out of the jar.  It is economical and tastes great. Wonderful coconut flavor. I also use it on my skin and as a deep conditioner for my hair.  Mixed with sugar it is a nice, natural exfoliant scrub.<br />If you live in a warmer climate it is definitely easier to use as it stays mostly liquid. However when mixing it with anything cold it does harden up so takes a little extra time to deal with.<br />If you don't want your coconut oil to taste like coconut - like some reviews I've seen - you should probably skip this purchase.

review/summary: Virgin Coconut Oil
review/text: I buy this regularly at Whole Foods for about $30. The price of this was slightly less, and I didn't have to pay shipping. Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) is a miracle food. I put a tablespoonful in my morning tea, cook with it, and even eat it off a spoon. It curbs my appetite, and helps my blood sugars (I'm diabetic). If you like the taste of coconut, you'll love this product. Nutiva is one of the best tasting VCOs around.

It doesn't fight with or overpower the foods you are cooking in it, rather lends a very mild, subtle dimension to every dish.  I haven't tried it on my hair or skin yet, but I understand it is great for that as well.  Try it.  You won't be sorry.

review/text: I have been studying all the benefits of coconut oil and wanted to get the best one. I use it in place of lotion, hair conditioning (leave on 20 minutes and wash your hair) and cooking. It is soooooo awesome I love the smell and my skin and hair look great. I had decided to get away from harmful chemicals and back to basics I put some in a little  pump bottle and no more lotion in my bathroom , even my hubby is using it now. I am like the church of coconut oil now. This bottle will last a year so it saves money too.

review/text: Nutiva coconut oil is the best there is.  I have tried many different brands over the years and by far Nutiva has the best flavor, consistency and price that I have found.  And with the convenience of ordering through Amazon, I do not have to search the Internet and hope that it is in stock at a vitamin store site.  You cannot go wrong ordering Nutiva coconut oil, I use it in my cooking daily.

review/summary: Such Good Value
review/text: Coconut oil has been a recent discovery for us this last year and we are really enjoying cooking with it. The health benefits are enormous. This particular version is great because the large, wide mouth container makes it easier to scoop out the desired amount. Coconut oil is solid at room temperature so, unlike olive oil or other oils that are liquid at room temperature, you can't just poor it out. Light coconut flavor and delicious coconut smell. This is the best way to get your coconut oil, in our opinion and it is a great price. Coconut oil isn't the cheapest oil available in the grocery store but it is certainly one of the best for you and being able to purchase it in large quantities for a great price is so helpful.

review/text: I just received this product.  While the smell and taste are nice, I still prefer the brand Spectrum for the richest taste and smoothest oil.  The Nutiva Coconut Oil is a bit grainy and doesn't have the intense flavor and fragrance of Spectrum. I'm not sure if that is indicative of better processing, a higher quality coconut, or what. At any rate, we go through a lot of it, and the price for this is hard to beat.

review/summary: Stopped Using It Internally Some Time Ago, But Going to Try It Again
review/text: I used this for many months a few years ago. By using it I was able to stay off of my biggest vice; sugar. I lost some weight on it, and had more energy while I was using it. However, after months of using it I got where I couldn't stand to drink it any more (I used it by adding it to hot water or tea, as I didn't like it changing the flavor of my foods by putting it in them). Also, after months of using it the odor of coconuts was coming through my skin. I have noticed this with other foods too so it isn`t just the CO: say if I eat raw onions for awhile - or use apple cider vinegar every day - their odor will begin to come through my skin. The odor wasn't such a big deal, but I just hated drinking it any more. And, then when my cholesterol levels went up instead of down, I just quit it. And, over a period of time after stopping it my cholesterol levels came back down. But, then I went back to the sweets and it has again gone high. And, I have gained a lot of weight by eating all those sweets. So, I am going back to EVCO to help me lose some weight and keep off of the sweets. I have been taking in Organic Apple Cider Vinegar regularly - as well as Cayenne Pepper, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols - so maybe that will help keep my cholesterol levels from going high from the EVCO. Hope so...<br /><br />Oh, ironically, before starting the CO so long ago my favorite candy bar was `Mounds'. I totally loved the taste of coconut! But, after doing the CO I got where I almost could gag on it, and it took me a couple of years before I ever ate another `Mounds' bar. I was just totally coconut'd out!<br /><br />Now I will once again be drinking it, but will also use it to replace the omega 6 oil in my oatmeal bran muffins. Maybe I will also experiment this time with using it on vegetables.<br /><br />Even though I quit drinking it I have continued to use it for other purposes:<br /><br />* I use it in the summers as a mosquito repellant. It actually repels mosquitoes (more than) twice as long as 'OFF' (without the chemicals). And, does a more effective job at keeping them away. With 'OFF' some will buzz around, me; not so with CO.<br />* Also, before I go out into the garden I put some under my fingernails, and then dirt doesn't stick under my nails. And, cleanup is a snap.<br />* I have been using it the last few weeks to put in my nose so the CPAP air doesn't dry me out so much, and it is working wonderfully for that. When I first put it in I don't like the smell, but get used to it after the CPAP has run awhile. But, when I pull the CPAP mask off in the mornings the first thing I smell is coconut. But, it is much cheaper and more effective than the gel I was buying for that purpose. The gel was drying up and creating a thick paste up in there, but the CO keeps everything smooth gliding, and it also kills off bacteria etc.<br />* I tried it on my face for awhile, but it caused my acne to flair pretty bad. But, it does wonders for my skin on my legs.<br /><br />I really am hoping that this time I will be able to stick with it, without getting to hating the flavor and odor of coconut again, and hope it doesn't raise my cholesterol levels again: being this time I will be also be using Apple Cider Vinegar, Cayenne, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols to keep my cholesterol levels down. And, the CO can just be a nice `accompaniment` to those things.

review/summary: Fresh, flavorful, and hexane-free
review/text: I've tried a few different brands of extra-virgin coconut oil, and for the most part I'm equally satisfied with them all. Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar. I should specify the qualities I look for in a coconut oil: I want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste, maximum nutrition, and minimal processing. For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find "packed on" and "best before" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the "best before" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as "organic." Do a little research; "cold-pressed," "organic," AND "hexane-free" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn't found it on sale at a good price. I put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar. Great deals can be found on Amazon, by the way, especially if you purchase the packs of two jars.

We use it for a substitute for shortening in baked goods(pie crust, cookies, etc.) We also prefer it now for frying eggs, potatoes, pancakes, everything, as it is much more stable at higher temps. --A word of caution, if you don't like coconut taste, it will take some getting used to.  My oldest daughter(17) falls into this catagory. She is now accepting it more and more.  The other 4 kids have had no trouble making the switch.  It is interesting that we now eat more healthier fats and fats in total, yet have lost weight.

review/text: I ordered this after hearing other moms talk about using coconut oil on their babies' bottoms instead of typical diaper rash cream.  The antifungal/antibacterial properties really do prevent rashes.  Our baby had already had 2 yeast rashes in his first 3 weeks after birth so I ordered this coconut oil and use it every other diaper change or when he looks red.  He has been 100% rash free for the last 4 weeks.  Also tried it out on my other son's dry chapped cheeks- worked great! I suffer from psoriasis and am considering adding some of this oil to my baths- you can't beat the fresh coconut smell either.

Doesn't add a lot of extra taste that you might think. Also, think it's not as stinky when frying as other oils.<br /><br /> Then I had to try it on my popcorn.  Oh, that is really wonderful.<br /><br />  Only problem I had is in delivery. The oil wasn't sealed well enough and it got warm enough during delivery to become somewhat liquid.  Some of the liquid leaked out in the box.  Just a warning if you live in a warm climate area.

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: I am back to order another container of this stuff after previously getting one for myself and one for my boyfriend (let him get his next jar himself, now that he's hooked on it.) I've tried other coconut oils and this one is by far the best. It's great that you can get such a big jar of it online...even health food grocery stores don't seem to carry much of a selection of coconut oil (and I live in granola-crunchy California.)<br /><br />This is great for cooking with, since it doesn't start smoking as soon as olive oil does. My boyfriend loves it for making biscuits as well as for spreading on top of biscuits or bread. We've used it in our "almost perfect Chicago deep dish style pizza" crust and people can never figure out what our "secret" ingredient is but they LOVE the pizza. It adds a great flavor in stirfrys and for sauteeing vegetable pot stickers.<br /><br />It does have quite a coconut flavor, which is part of the reason why we love it so much, but if you don't like the taste of coconut or you are making something where that taste or aroma might not be appropriate you probably want to choose another type of oil.<br /><br />Oh! It's perfect for seasoning cast iron, too!

review/summary: Nutiva VCO - Great Product
review/text: Amazon delivered exactly what I ordered and on time. For me, Nutiva VCO is a great alternative to unhealthy cooking oils. If we compare short-chain fatty acids (such as the lauric chains in coconut oil) which are metabolized within the mitochondria of cells, versus longer chain-bearing oils which require conjugation and transport to the liver, I think VCO must be healthier for me overall.  Nutiva also tastes good and frankly people, it's a great lotion. Yes, it takes a few minutes to sink in, but once it does, you have soft skin.

We don't use butter any more, just coconut oil, a little salt or sugar on toast, on veggies, for everything it's so much better for you than butter and other dairy.  Great cooking oil too, doesn't break down like all other oils.<br /><br />The 54 oz is the way to go...we buy 4 at a time and go through them in about 4-6 months.<br /><br />Wonderful product, Amazon is the best too, you can't beat the free ship.<br /><br />Local store retail for the same product costs almost 3 times as much.

review/summary: Not a Bad Fat Anymore
review/text: Excellent product!! I have found that coconut oil can be used in any way you would use oil or butter. It has a very mild coconut flavor----nothing that would really alter the taste of what you're preparing. It can take high heat cooking without breaking down. (All the benefits of olive oil are destroyed with high heat). It doesn't need refrigeration----another plus. Tastes great on toast. Too bad the good things about coconut oil have been surpressed for so many years. It seems to be one of the healthy fats instead of all the synthetics (e.g. margarine) and hydrogenated products on the market.<br />Must be organic, unprocessed, & cold pressed to have all the good benefits.

review/summary: Deal
review/text: I bought this item because of the healthy reputation of the product.  I like to make popcorn in oil and I do usually cook something in oil about once a week.  I can tell you that this is honestly the best oil I have ever used.  It smells terrific and makes the food taste great.  My popcorn is light and fluffy like hot air popcorn, but has a nice rich taste like oil cooked popcorn.  When you open the container you are greeted with a terrific coconut smell.  For those of you who do not like coconut, it does not stay with the food once you heat it up.  Amazon is the place to buy this, the price is outstanding and this size will last you a long time.

review/summary: Tastes great; is it really healthy?
review/text: Love the taste, great for stir frys as well as a great additive to smoothies. I'm in two minds over the health issue though; searching medical journals only seems to show a vast majority of negative results (this stuff *is* mostly saturated fat after all) with a huge number of hits on sites which frankly sell this stuff. I don't know but I felt the need to balance all the glowlingly positive reviews...they jury is still out on whether this stuff really is good for you (hydrogenated coconut oil certainly isn't...this stuff is hopefully different)

review/summary: NOT the same Quality as the "smaller" packages
review/text: I used to buy 1 & 2 lbs - smaller packages which I was very satisfied with the Quality.<br />At this time ordered 1 Gallon and I am quite Disapointed as quality of Coconut oil is not NOT the same. It looks more transluent (less white) and even at room temperature oil is VERY soft (almost runny) also it has LESS coconut fragrance .... I will NOT buy this package again.
