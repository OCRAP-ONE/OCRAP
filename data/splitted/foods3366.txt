review/summary: A Real Low-Sodium Soup
review/text: I am on a low-sodium/sodium restricted diet for something called Meniere's Disease.  As a result I have to keep my sodium under 2000mg a day, although I find it's best if I keep it between 1200 and 1800 a day, trying to hit about 1500.<br /><br />Most the time when I look for soup at the store, it's reduced sodium (meaning it's NOT low-sodium, but has less than the original version...low-sodium products always have to be 140mg or less).  This is an actual low sodium product.<br /><br />While many of the reduced-sodium soups are 400-600mg a serving, a serving is not always a whole can.<br /><br />What I like about this is that it's 140mg for a whole 10.75 oz can.  The other thing I like is that it has a lot of FLAVOR.<br /><br />Also, this price is pretty good.  When my Target has it, that's when it actually has it, it is under $2, but my local grocery store, where I normally buy it, is over $2.<br /><br />I've tried several low-sodium broths before, and none of them had flavor, or at least not a good one, and are only good when used as an ingredient, and not as a soup.  This actual tastes like the chicken soup my mom used to make when I was a kid, and can no longer have.<br /><br />In my opinion, just the right amount of chicken chunks, noodles, and veggies.<br /><br />If you want to kick up the flavor some more, you can add a little pepper or parsley...or even a pinch of sodium-free bouillon, such as<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012272NI">Wyler's Instant Bouillon, Sodium Free Chicken, 2.62-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)</a> or Herb-Ox Chicken Instant Broth & Seasoning, Sodium Free, 8-Count Packets (Pack of 12).<br /><br />The Herb-Ox is a bit more expensive, but if you make anything that it's the main flavoring, it's worth the extra cost.  As a side-note, both also make sodium-free beef bouillons.  I use both the beef and chicken to make mashed potatoes, gravies, roasts...anything that needs that something extra.<br /><br />My real recommedation with this soup though, is to try it before you tweak it.  As I said, it has a LOT of FLAVOR already, and odds are you won't want to add anything.<br /><br />Just in case you want to know the full-nutrition, here it is:<br /><br />Nutrition Facts**<br /><br />Amount Per Serving (serving size) = 1 can<br /><br />Calories 160<br />Total Fat 4.5g<br />  Sat.

One drop to 2 ounces of water goes quite a long ways. It's amazing!

review/text: YOU ONLY NEED ONE DROP...count it - ONE.  Maybe two in a large portion of anything.  It flavors...more than sweetens (hard to describe) like sugar - but it is more of an after taste of sweetness...which is not bad...give it a try - especially if you need to avoid sugar.  It is really different, but good different - use a light hand and you won't be sorry.  Use too much and you'll get too much sweetness - I guarantee.  Good for diabetics or people who want to avoid sugar.  Great in tea or coffee or anything.  I even put in in cottage cheese.  The possibilities are endless.  If deciding to cook with it - do look up how to do that - I do not know.

review/summary: Stevia DOES have some bad side effects!
review/text: I've always heard that Stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no ill side effects, so I was very interested to try it... especially when I started making my own yogurt, and would do anything to get my toddler to eat it! I did some research and found that the SweetLeaf brand was supposed to be the best, as far as extraction methods and experience. I got a bottle of the Vanilla Creme, and also the plain, and added it to our yogurt. It was fantastic! We all loved it, and the toddler begged for more. I was so relieved to have found a great way to reduce the sugar in our diets and still have such a great sweet taste. It was perfect, I was happy. But then, strange symptoms started to surface. At first I got headaches, which became increasingly severe, and then backaches that felt like spinal 'brain freeze' (when you eat something too cold too fast.) It didn't occur to me at first that it could be at all related to the new Stevia. Then my toddler started telling me he was itchy all over. Then I got my menstrual cycle 2 weeks early. Finally it dawned on me that it could be related to the Stevia since this was the only thing at all that had changed in our diets. I googled 'adverse reactions to Stevia' and found several webpages where people described symptoms identical to mine. I was truly shocked. I stopped the Stevia... all the symptoms went away almost immediately. I realize now that there is a difference between the flavored liquid Stevia, which contains a 'proprietary blend' and 'natural flavors' (which could mean anything) and just the straight powder with nothing added (I haven't tried that, but won't now.) It also occurs to me that maybe the only Stevia that can truly be considered historically safe is the actual leaf itself, straight off the plant out of the garden. I still believe Stevia's safety record in the countries where it originated, but I think something has probably been lost in translation with the processing of it here in the US. Just my opinion. It should also be noted that anyone with allergies to ragweed should not take Stevia because it can cause asthma attacks. Hope this helps someone.

review/text: Love this product. The liquid stevias are great. They are economical, easy to use, and help me keep my sugar intake down. What I really love about them the most is that unlike the powdered stevia, there is very little aftertaste. This is my favorite flavor of all the flavors and the one I find myself using most often. I was never able to use Stevia by itself before because of the aftertaste but that all changed with the flavored liquid stevias. I can comfortably just add this Vanilla Creme stevia for any sweetening I need and it does the job well. Just love it.

review/text: When I was told I was insulin resistent, I knew I had to give up using sugar, especially in my coffee.  I tried a few stevia packets from different companies but hated the taste, or aftertaste these left.  They altered the taste of the coffee beyond the point of enjoying the drink.  Then someone brought me a liquid form of stevia and it was decidedly better than the granules.  I still wasn't totally satisfied, but I was making do.  One day I went into a health boutique where I discovered the SweetLeaf Liquid Stevia with vanilla and finally coffee tastes like coffee again!

review/summary: Wonderful stuff!  So glad Sweetleaf came up with this!!
review/text: I've been using flavored stevia drops for several years now and don't know what I would do without them.  All the flavors are good but the vanilla creme is an all around winner so if you can only afford to try one flavor this one might be your best bet.  Don't be discouraged by the seemingly high price - one of these little bottles will last a very long time plus you're getting pure high quality ingredients, nothing to damage your health like with sugar and artificial sweeteners.  I find I like stevia better to sweeten cold things than I do hot things.  I personally like about eight drops in a large (8 - 10 oz) tumbler of cold seltzer water that I make using the Isi soda siphon ISI Soda Siphons.  Sometimes I add dry milk powder for a low calorie treat that mocks an ice cream soda.  Sounds odd but it's very good actually.  Now if only Sweetleaf would come out with ginger flavored drops I could make my fav soft drink - ginger ale!!!!

review/text: The great thing about liquid stevia is that it lacks that "chemical taste" (even though stevia is an all natural-no chemical product) that powdered stevia has. I tried Sweet Leaf vanilla stevia at my friend's house in my tea and the vanilla flavor is wonderful! The best part is that stevia is something like 200 times sweeter than sugar and contains NO calories (not to mention no harmful chemicals), so it only takes about 5 drops to sweeten an entire cup of tea! Highly recommended!

review/summary: Delicious and fresh but, caution is advised...
review/text: Firstly, google the health benefits of fungreek [they are numerous].<br /><br />Secondly, fenugreek is one of those spices that you cannot deal with like other spices. These little seeds are hard as rocks and unless you want to ruin your spice-grinder, I'd highly recommend you follow my procedure for using fenugreek:<br /><br />Well, to begin, fenugreek is actually a legume (so, if you are prone to gastro problems with beans and legumes then you might want to take a beano or equivalent supplement before ingesting fenugreek).<br /><br />If you want the benefits of raw fenugreek seeds. Put 1/4 cup of fenugreek seeds in a 2 cup or so capacity container and add 1/2 cup boiling water and let steep for an hour, place steeped fenugreek covered in fridge overnight and you will have some lovely, slightly chewy, less bitter fenugreek that you can add to soups and stews or eaten by the spoonful as a health supplement. One thing you will notice, is, when you add hot water to fenugreek, they will not only soften, but, they will sprout out little tail-buds which makes them sort of mid-sprout and highly digestible.<br /><br />If you want to fully sprout fenugreek, you can google for many techniques.<br /><br />If you only want to sprout this fenugreek, I'd say this is highly sproutable since even adding boiling water to the seeds did not stop them from sprouting little sprout ends.<br /><br />Warning: If you 'toast' fenugreek it will stink up your house to high hell and it takes days and days to get the odor out of your house and if you are planning on selling your home, you do NOT want to toast fenugreek!<br /><br />Anyway, my husband hates fenugreek and I love it with a passion. I think fenugreek is one of those love or hate spices.<br /><br />In closing, this fenugreek is very high quality, fresh and definitely sproutable!<br /><br />Happy fenugreeking! lol

But I use 2 cups seeds for sprouting according to  general seeds sprouting instructions and only 4 to 5 seeds grow. While I use the same sprouting technique to sprout mung bean seeds, they grow well.

review/summary: oops I reviewed the wrong brand!
review/text: I'd been devastated when, recently, my favorite brand fennugreek seeds (which i use only for sprouts) began having 15% "HARD" (i.e., wouldn't soften even with 24 hours of soaking) seeds.  I've switched to Starwest and find they have had 0% hard seeds and sprouted to 1/2 inch sprouts after soaking 24 and then growing 24 hours.  Very gratifying.  Have them every day!

review/summary: serves the purpose
review/text: I bought fenugreek seeds as a nursing supplement, because this way it was much cheaper than buying any nursing tea out there.  I've been using them for a few months now, and have been able to exclusively breastfeed my baby.  I steep a teaspoon of seeds 2-4 times and drink throughout the day.  when the seeds become soft, i munch on them, too.  In the beginning the tea and seeds tasted pretty bitter to me, but in a few days i got used to the taste, and now i enjoy it, especially when adding raw honey

review/text: I must say even though I really like Frontier products this one really disappointed me. Maybe there was an issue with this particular stock the thing is that any of the seeds from the bags sprouted. I will keep buying spices and other products from this company but I will certainly pay more attention to the reviews of their sprouts before thinking about buying any from them.

review/text: used this for fenugreek tea for breastfeeding milk production. I never had a problem with milk production while using this like I did with my last child. Just let 1Tbsp. sit in a glass of water overnight, remove the seeds and drink the "tea" (tasted better warmed up and with a little honey). This and a lactation cookie every now and then and I was able to breastfeed my youngest son for 9 months now when I ran out of milk at 6 months with my middle child.

review/summary: Much better than corn starch for gluten-free cooking.
review/text: Many gluten-free baking recipes call for arrowroot, which is hard to find in health food stores.  (I'm in Austin, Texas. ?)  Anyway, this is incredibly cheap--it's a tenth the price of some suppliers.<br /><br />When to use this:  in any recipe where you would use wheat flour for a thickener, like soup, sauce, gravy or pudding.<br /><br />Why to use it:  your alternative is corn starch, which can be shiny and tastes like corn.<br /><br />(Imagine vanilla pudding that tastes like corn.)  Arrowroot isn't as gluey as corn starch, and doesn't thicken as well, but it won't overwhelm other flavors.  (Imagine chocolate pudding that tastes like corn.)

review/summary: Perfect Pantry Addition
review/text: Roasted red pepper seems to be an unknown culinary item to many of us but adds a unique flavor to salads and seemingly everything else. I add these strips to egg omelettes, sandwiches and sometimes soups. It's a magic ingredient like capers that we should use more of. The label says "Product of Turkey" which is good news to me and I have had previous experience with the Roland brand which I like. I ordered a four (4) pack via Amazon Subscribe & Save last year and just received my second pack last week. The only reason I'm going with a 4-Star rating is that this order arrived with slightly dented cans. The product is still completely usable and the price was right regardless. I did submit packaging feedback and hope this will not happen again. This shipment moved via USPS here to Hawaii so substantial extra handling likely happened. Since I'm the first reviewer, and if you haven't used Roasted Red Pepper before, try it in your next recipe or preparation. If it's a go order these in bulk.  John

review/summary: Great for strong chewers
review/text: Our dog is a very strong chewer and we are always looking for something that is safe for her to chew, but will keep her interest for extended time. Tried the reindeer antlers and she enjoys them, but once they have been chewed on she loses interest. Not so with the moose chew.  She chews on it until she gets tired.  There have been no sharp edges or shards to injure her. I bought a 2-pack to try and the first one has lasted a few days now.<br />They are expensive compared to rawhide or pig ears, etc.  But it has held her interest longer than nylabones. Haven't seen any bad digestive reactions so far.

review/text: I gave the two pieces of antler to a friend's two pitbulls and he said they had devoured them in about two hours. For the price, it was a waste of money. I guess if someone had a smaller dog it would be worth it, but the dogs in my arena are big dogs and bigger chewers and the antlers didn't last half a day. I won't spend money on antlers again. I will try to find someone who goes hunting and will give them to me for free. Nice idea though.

review/text: I was buying these at the pet store for $20 EACH, with this deal you get two for that price.  I ordered the largest size possible because I know my corgis like to chew the heck out of these.  They love these.  I've discovered they prefer the flat ones to the rounded type.  One that was sent in this deal was just a little curved, which makes it harder for their stumpy legs to hold while chewing, so they "argue" over who gets the un-bent one!  If I hold the crooked one then they will chew it but they definitely like the flatter one best!  A very good value if your dogs are chewers!!!

review/summary: Great Natural Treat
review/text: These moose antlers are a great natural treat for my small dogs. I bought the first antler piece because my trainer recommended  it as a preservative-free product. The pieces I purchased through Amazon are small but for little dogs like my 7 month old Chihuahuas they will last a long time. I prefer these over bully sticks or rawhides because they do not cause any tummy upset or difficulties with the pups' stool. For small dogs like mine, just a few minutes with a bully stick today means a rumbling tummy tomorrow. When I first introduced the antler piece, the female barked at it and ran away. The male immediately took to it so his sister had to give it a try. Now she loves them as much as he does. They will sit or down or just about anything to get their antler. Another plus is that I will let them bring the antler onto my lap! Not so with a slimy bully sticks.

review/text: I have tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DWW8">Albanese 12 Flavor Assorted Gummi Bears, Fat Free, 5-Pound Bags (Pack of 2)</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVT042">Haribo Gummi Candy, Original Gold-Bears, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> - they both have their pros and cons, when compared to each other.  Reviewing them here is beside the point... I only mention both Gummies, because of their popularity, and to help compare this gummi to them.<br /><br />The Albanese gummies I have eaten were very soft and flavorful, while the Haribo gummies were more stiff and not as juicy in flavor.  When I tried the Haribo gummies, I found an upside to them being more stiff and less juicy - they actually felt a bit healthier to eat.  If anyone understands that?  There are just some foods that you eat, and afterwards you can just feel how unhealthy it was for your body.  -.-;  Thankfully I have yet to get that feeling with these gummies.<br /><br />Anyway this gummi is between both of the mentioned gummies for softness - not on the extremely soft side (Albanese), and not too stiff (Haribo).  It provides you with a firm bite, yet a soft, gummi chewing experience.  Do not expect these to have as much flavor as their other (Albanese) gummi bear friends.  As another reviewer pointed out, they are not extremely juicy in raspberry flavor (like Haribo); I do not mind, so I am still giving them all five stars instead of four.<br /><br />No sewage smell, no negative smell at all.  Both 5lb bags were packed in clear bags, and then packed together in one of those green bags to help preserve freshness, and also to deter them from picking up any unwanted smells during transition - worked great!<br /><br />I hope you enjoy these gummi treats as much as I am!  I have already subscribed to them, as I am just one of those people who like chewing on something gummi.

Almost since birth he's had fussiness, gas, rock hard stomach and screaming fits. We've tried switching formulas, we've tried the mylacon drops as well as gripe water. Nothing really worked and his doctor sort of insisted it was all in my head. My sister, who lives in NY bought this locally and from day 1 I could see a difference. The screaming stopped, so did the constant gassiness. The fennel is the key- it's what helps with all the stomach problems. It's a pity most people don't know about alternative treatments such as this. You can't find it in a supermarket and I was actually shocked they sold it here on Amazon. Aside from the helpful nature of this tea, it's also a great in-between drink for the baby. I would recommend this to any parent that's had similar experiences with their child. This really is a wonderful product!

review/text: My son is a very gassy baby.  My pediatrician recommended giving him water in between feedings, which he would take a few sips and spit out.  We started using this product and he loves it; it also helps with his gas better than gripe water or gas drops.  Great product!

review/summary: Somewhat Disappointing
review/text: Generally speaking, I love mussels and was hoping these mussels might substitute for those times when I couldn't get fresh ones. The smell was unpleasant, reminiscent of cheap cat food. The texture was mushy. Perhaps being packed in water is not helpful; I would not order them again. Have been very pleased by almost everything else I have ordered from Roland, however.

review/summary: Yummy yummy yummy I've got bunnies in my tummy
review/text: I bought a box of these for the first time this week at my local health food store.  There are not a lot of gluten free little kid friendly cookies out there, or even for adults.  There's a pretty strong sweet smell coming from the cookies in the bag.  The chocolate bunnies do have a chocolate flavor and the vanilla bunnies do have a vanilla cookie taste.  They are a bit on the gritty side, anyone who has been gluten free long enough can tell you that this seems to be the norm of a lot of gluten free items anyway.  They aren't overly sweet, they are just plain tasty and when my 3 month old gets old enough for gluten free snacking, these are going to make a good finger food treat for him once in awhile.

review/summary: Not the Annie's I'm used to
review/text: These cookies are not very good on their own. The cocoa ones are almost bitter instead of sweet. The vanilla ones are just kind of bland. The texture is a little lacking as well. I would recommend these to accompany something else, like a gluten free biscotti for your coffee, but not on their own.<br /><br />I'm glad Annie's is making gluten free items, and I wish I could try Annie's guten free mac and cheese, as it has good ratings. For now, I just have to wait and hope they come out with a better gluten free cookie than this.

review/summary: Yummy cookies for gluten free
review/text: We bought these to take to school since they were declared peanut free on the box, but unfortunately as is often the case, it is also gluten free.  Despite their odd texture (gluten free stuff is often "grainy" feeling to chew I find,) everyone in our house liked them, especially the chocolate ones.  For those with food allergies though, this box states "made in a peanut-free and tree nut-free facility" and is not labeled as containing any of the 8 major allergens.  We love that they are all natural and made without GMOs and that they are shaped like cute little bunnies.  These cookies are made from rice and corn flour instead of wheat.  The only downside is that they are a bit expensive, however we have only found them so far in Whole Foods here in Hawaii and they approach $5 a box.  We managed to set up our subscribe and save when the discount was still 15%, but it has dropped to a dismal 5% across the board (boo Amazon, first Amazon Mom and now subscribe and save).  Still cheaper than buying on the economy though.

review/text: Okay, these cookies are simply dangerous to have around the house...because its hard to stop eating them!  They taste pretty much exactly like the non-gluten free Annie's bunny cookies, which is a plus, and they are great to take to parties.<br /><br />These are crunchy little bunny-shaped cookies, but if you don't like the crunch then just open the bag inside and let them get a teensy bit stale and they will be softer.  I actually prefer them that way, the same as with Teddy Grahams (also better when softer).  But Annie's bunny cookies seem slightly less sweet than the other kinds of tiny cookies out there, but still sweet enough that kids will like them.  They also enjoy the shapes and different flavors all in one box.<br /><br />As a side note, the box itself is cute to read.

But its nothing terrible (I should note we are newly gluten free too 3 months, so I still taste and notice gluten free things).  But the flavor was great, especially the vanilla.<br /><br />Unfortunately, we just ate these too fast.  If you have some self-restraint I would highly recommend these.

review/text: I am quite finicky when it comes to gluten free snacks but Annie's gluten free cocoa and vanilla bunny cookies are good at satisfying a snack craving. The texture is not too grainy and the flavor is just right; they are not overly sweet which I prefer. I like giving these to my kids because they aren't full of junk. The only downside is the price but you have to up your bottom line in general when purchasing gluten free products.

review/text: Just finding out my 4 year old had celiac was horrible! We thought it would be terrible finding gluten free treats for her, and while there isn't a ton of selection out there I was happy to find these. The taste and texture is similar to a teddy graham, maybe a little harder. The flavor is spot on and my daughter seems to really like them. The lack of gluten just made them slightly drier than a teddy graham but it's not terribly noticeable. The price on these was fantastic and the fact that I can get them online is wonderful. These products while very tasty, can be difficult to find in normal grocery stores. Highly recommended snack!

They are especially delicious if you dip them in Nutella. Whole Foods also offers another gluten free flavor "Snickerdoodle" that my wife actually prefers to this variety. Hopefully Amazon will get the Snickerdoodle flavor or possibly a gluten free multi-pack sometime in the near future!

review/summary: Great - Just what I was looking for
review/text: I had seen some chocolate non gluten free animal crackers at the store and was thinking that I wished I could find some GF ones.  When I found these shortly after that I was thrilled.  I love these cookies.  I think the only negative is that they are too good and I can't stop eating them!  They are little so would be great for kids too.  I've been gluten free for 7 years and so it's been a long time since I had non GF cookies but these matched the taste of what I remember for chocolate animal cookies.  I like the vanilla ones too but I haven't had trouble finding those kind of cookies.  So I was more thrilled about the chocolate cookies.<br /><br />I know some people rated these low and of course we're all differentso far as what we like.  I've bought my share of GF stuff that tasted like cardboard.  But personally I love these cookies!

review/summary: My baby loves them, and I agree
review/text: I have a nine month old baby who I have decided to feed a gluten free diet for at least the first year. I found these and they seemed like something she would enjoy. They are the perfect size for her little fingers. She is so cute when she eats them. She seems to like the chocolate better, and gets it all over her face. They are not too sweet, which makes me feel better about giving them to children. I tasted them, and while a little chalky, they are some of the best gluten free cookies I have had. If you want them to taste just like cookies containing gluten, you won't be happy. But if you want a pretty darn good gluten free cookie these are it. My own gluten free mommy tried them, and said there was no way she would be able to order a case from Amazon because she would eat them all wayyy too fast.

I just wished they have different packaging to distinguish flour/wheat bunnies from GF bunnies. It will makes shopping easier for sure.

My 127lb German Shepherd has been fed this formula twice a day for many years (since back when it was O&M)and at 15 years of age is still going strong! All of the seven shepherds we have on this food are remarkably strong and healthy with no digestive, skin or allergy issues.

review/summary: Great Company
review/text: A great organic dog food for senior dogs. The company resides very close to where I live and are active in the community. I found them at a street fair where they were giving away free samples and all the dogs were very happy about it. They have a friendly staff that really cares about your pet. Highly recommended to keep your dog happy and healthy. Laughing Dog has different formulas so you can find the one that is just right.

review/summary: Laughing Dog saved my wolfie!
review/text: Our family has 4 dogs and a cat :) The most fragile is our wolfie dog (siberian husky). Ever since we switched his food he has more umph in his prance! I think all the omegas and coconut oil really help his aging joints.  We went from a dog we thought we were going to have to put down a year and a half ago to a happy husky. Also, his poops are firm, moist and consistent now (sign of good health).

review/summary: Kibble size - 8 lb. vs. 16 lb. bag
review/text: UPDATE: No word on the kibble size, however the 16 lb. size lasted about 6 - 7 weeks for my Westie. Then the remaining 1/4 bag turned moldy. If you have a small dog, stay with the 8 lb. bag!<br /><br />My 11 yr. old Westie loves this food. His breed suffers from skin issues. We see improvement with his skin, he's more lively - and he's definitely more enthusiastic about eating!<br /><br />I bought the 8 lb. bag to try it. This time I bought the 16 lb. bag. There's a big difference in the kibble size with the 16 lb. being not quite double - but significantly bigger. Westies are not big dogs. He's doing okay with it. I've contacted Laughing Dog to see if that's normal. I didn't see a difference in the product description or on the bag - unless I'm missing something.<br /><br />Anyway - great product! I feel better knowing he's getting good natural ingredients and extra nutrition.
