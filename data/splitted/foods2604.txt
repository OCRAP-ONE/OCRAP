review/summary: Used these for DIY wedding flowers...
review/text: It was 95 degrees out on the day my wedding flowers arrived---and it was 90 the next day.  On the day of our wedding, it was less hot--about 80.  However, somehow my beautiful flowers survived! They looked vibrant and alive all day.  I think I at least partially owe this to these packets.  We ordered the flowers from an online retailer who told us to have buckets, water, shears, and flower food ready to go.  I realized a few days before the wedding that I had forgotten the flower food so used my Amazon prime to ship these to my mother-in-law's house where the wedding was being held.  Well, we put a few packets of these in every bucket (along with all the other stuff we had to do).  As I said, flowers were gorgeous--so at the very least this did not hinder their survival and I think they definitely helped!

review/summary: Exact Same Flavor as the Select Harvest Campbells Brand
review/text: No surprise here, they've simply repackaged their other "types" of soups into new wrapping, slapping "kettle style" on it along with a heftier $. I can't tell a flavor difference between this & their Chicken Tuscany (Chicken and White Beans with Herbs) Soup. The only differences are the packaging & price - oh & a little more sodium per serving. Misleading packaging too - I thought because it was plastic it was a microwavable soup until I reviewed the panel & realized I still needed to hunt up a microwavable bowl at work. Blah.

review/summary: Great Product - MUST HAVE
review/text: Because of the negative reviews, I thought I should add my opinion. First, I bought one of these at Wal-Mart. When I realized that it really did make two whole lunches for me, I couldn't wait to buy more. My average daily calorie intake is 1,700 so these fit well in my eating plan. First, the chili is great. I do NOT like hot (spicy) food. The beans retained their firmness, the chicken was moist and edible. I can't say enough good things about the taste of this chili.<br /><br />As for sodium, that doesn't matter to me so I don't care. I can say it has less sodium than the comparable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029TECEA">Microwavable Chicken Corn Chowder</a> (740mg to 840mg per serving). But here's the most important part to me:<br /><br />Total Fat 2g<br />Dietary Fiber 7g<br />Protein 15g<br />Potassium 590mg<br />Iron 10%<br />Calories 190<br />Total Carb. 27g<br /><br />Who knew low-fat could taste so good!! And the fiber! Protein! Potassium! Iron!<br /><br />Also, I warmed this up on the stove, not in the microwave - but that's my preference.

review/summary: Very Good Soup
review/text: I noticed a lot of negative reviews of this soup on here, so I wanted to share a dissenting opinion.  I consider myself an above average home cook, and I think that I make an excellent homemade chili.  I'd give my chili a solid 9/10, and I eat a lot of chili, haha.  On the same scale, I'd give this chili a 7.5/10.<br /><br />It's pricey, and yes, some point out it has a lot of sodium, but if you're primarily concerned about taste, it's very good.  It is slightly (but not overly) spicy, it is very hearty (unlike many other soups which have lots of broth) and filling, and the quality of the ingredients is, in my opinion, excellent for any canned product.  Obviously this isn't the same as a chili made homemade with fresh ingredients, but the reality is that you can't expect that from any store-bought, canned product.<br /><br />If you want a very easy and filling meal, you're like me and love a hearty chili with good flavor, and you're not especially price sensitive, then I strongly recommend this.  After all, the ~$4 it costs for a can of this -- you can't even get a full fast food meal for that price anymore (and even if you could, that meal would be far more unhealthy).

review/summary: It's food...
review/text: If you're at the store or at the office and this is one of the only things you see to eat, this isn't an absolutely horrible thing to eat. It's just not the best thing for you to eat either.<br /><br />Taste-wise, this was just OK. It's nice enough that I could finish it, but don't be misled by the quaint packaging or fancy name. This pretty much tastes a little better than your average canned chili, but you'd be hard pressed to identify any of the specific flavors in it. The chicken inside is so processed that I don't think I'd have been able to identify the meat's origin if I hadn't read the label. Someone on here compared this to Alpo for humans and they're not far off by saying this.<br /><br />Health-wise, this is OK enough as long as you're not watching your sodium. There's 31% of your daily sodium in one serving of this and since the cup is two servings, you're getting 62% of your daily sodium from one meal. I'm not as savvy with the rest of the nutrition info, but the calories aren't terrible, being 380 for one cup.<br /><br />In the end this was good enough for me to eat and enjoy for one meal, but the generic taste (no special spices or flavors) and the high sodium keeps me from saying that I'd buy this again. I might get it again if I'm in a pinch and it's the only thing I can get, but offhand this just isn't something I'd see myself generally eating any more than maybe once a year.<br /><br />If you're just someone who wants something quick and easy to pop in the microwave, be aware that the cup is not microwave safe.

review/summary: Best baby formula for sensitive tummies
review/text: GREAT GREAT GREAT PRODUCT! The milk is GOD SENT for babies with sensitive tummies, who cannot take cow milk and/or soy. My 3-months old daughter had reflux, high acid level in her tummy, colics, gas and constipation varying with diarrhea. My husband and I are both foreign residents in Switzerland and I have to say that Swiss formula market is apolling in terms of choice, and useless doctors just kept medicating her instead of changing the cow milk formula to something more appropriate, just gave her more and more different drugs which only added to the problem. At some point she was crying all day long for several days!! I stopped listening to the doctors and did some online research- tried soy milk formula and lactose free formula (both Nestle), no changes. I tried all 3-4 cow milk formulas available on the Swiss market (Adapta, Holle, Milupa, Nestle) - no changes!<br />Finally I found a can of Meyenberg goat powder milk in the house, which I had bought previously for my organic cosmetics hobby- and gave it a try in a pure desperation. WHAT A CHANGE! She is like a different baby. ALL PROBLEMS GONE INSTANTLY- on the same day. I took the baby off all the medications these so-called specialists were overmedicating her with ( I am changing the pediatrician as well), and she feels perfect and is happier than I've ever seen her. I am stashing up with this milk now for a long time, as no Meyenberg milk is sold locally. Would highly recommend this product to all parents looking for a healthy  solution for their babies- goat milk protein is much easier to digest by small tummies. Furthermore, historically, long before any commercial baby formulas were invented, goat milk (and NOT cow milk!!! soy was not even on the menu) was used for centuries to feed babies by mothers who could not breastfeed. Today, when everything is Marketing-driven and cow milk manufacturers are dominating the market, this fact is totally forgotten, and all of a sudden other products are advertised to be appropriate (on top of that commercial brands stuff their formulas with all sorts of ingredients and chemicals their imagination can come up with- no matter if good for babies or not). The Meyenberg goat milk has few, simple ingredients which do not overwhelm small tummies, it is fantastically nutricious, natural and tasty. My daughter cannot get enough of it- I never saw her having such a healthy appetite towards any other milk she was given.<br /><br />The only request to the seller (the Vitamine Shoppe - actually one of the most professional sellers on Amazon)- please please please speed up your order processing! Although it arrived earlier than estimated (7 days instead of estimated 9 days after the order was placed), but the order processing itself took 5 days before it was actually shipped by expedited shipping. This is far too long, if the baby cannot eat anything else. If you could process orders faster- it would help a lot!<br />Thank you very much for shipping this product to Switzerland anyway (I think it is almost the only reliable seller who does)- it's a life savior.

It is a great substitute for cow's milk and soy milk and it tastes great. I think that the fresh goat milk has a little bit of smell but this powdered one is just so rich, creamy and delicious.

review/summary: good stuff, keep in the fridge
review/text: Started my 1 year old on goat milk because his system couldn't tolerate cows milk. He was a breastfed baby before that. I didn't want to start him on soy because it has less fat and calories than whole cows milk. Mixing up batches of milk used to be a nightmare but i've learned a few tricks. Keep your canisters in the fridge, this makes the powder less "clumpy" and can be scooped out easily. Shake up the refrigerated canisters to break up clumps. Whisk powder into one part hot water (from the tap works for me) and when its all mixed in add one part cold water. Keep in the fridge in a covered container.

I usually have a glass every few nights so the can'll last longer. I sleep better/deeper on nights when I've had goats milk.<br /><br />For mothers whose children suffer from any sort of stomach/intestinal distress and you cannot breastfed for any reason, before you go to artificial sources of "milk" for your child, please give Goat's milk a try. Goat's milk is the only milk that is most similar to human breast milk, and the price is really inexpensive, especially when you look at other brands of baby formula being sold on the market.

review/summary: The closest thing to FRESH GOAT milk
review/text: My poor baby was lactose intolerant and suffered from colics, so I had to give her that soy stuff I won't even touch. When she turned 12-mon/old and thanks to a friend I found Meyenberq... My toddler loves it and after some research I can't believe I didn't try it sooner.  I have also tried fresh from the farm goat milk. OMG!!! is hard to get in NJ but totally worth it. I can order it online from a source and boil it at home. Can't get fresher than that. Still love Meyernberq and use it when I need it.  It worked out great for our vacation to the caribbean last week!<br /><br />If you research store bought caw milk you will be disgusted at what you are drinking, specially the UHT stuff. Try raw milk. You can get it in Connecticut and NYC. Don't be scared about the bad publicity, that is just another way to use "fear" to manipulate consumers. Be cautious and informed. Visit farms, boil it at home, wash your hands. That's all it takes and if you are really comfortable, drink it raw! so many benefits you wouldn't even believe. ENJOY!

review/summary: A godsend for infants!!!
review/text: My 5mo daughter has a severely sensitive stomach associated to an iron intolerance. She's been formula fed since the beginning due to my personal choice. I went through 8 different commerical milk-based and soy-based formulas. A good friend of ours suggested goat's milk. Her nephew was a failure to thrive baby and the ONLY formula he didn't throw up was Goat's Milk. I can easily find the liquid Goat's Milk at our local grocery store. Unfortunately, I have yet to come across the powder at said grocery store. I was home visiting my parents and was in search of the liquid, but found the powder. Strange that a smaller grocery store in a much smaller metropolitian area would have the powder versus a very large grocery store in the US's 4th largest metropolitian who just has the liquid.<br /><br />Anyways, after 8 weeks of trial & error, we have a very happy 5mo baby. I wish would have found this formula earlier.<br />I added a mixture of goat's milk and pulp-free, plain coconut water into my daughter's feedings and it not only has cleaned her system out, but has stopped the colic, vomiting, reflux, constipation AND to replace her electrolytes. Again, I will repeat. Lower iron content equals happier, calmer baby. We still have the lingering green poops compliments of the iron oxidation; however, the iron tolerance has been greatly minimized. No colic, no vomiting, no reflux and no constipation. She has one bottle of coconut water/goat's milk every day just to keep the GI tract from metabolizing the excess iron proteins and to replace her ever so important electrolytes. Ironically, she actually takes this formula mixture better than the traditional formulas!!

review/text: We have a now two week old Clydesdale/Quarter Horse cross colt who was born on our farm and whose mother not only rejected him but attacked him. He spent the first 7 days of his life in an equine Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Mare's milk replacer alone gave him diarrhea, but when goat's milk was added, he had no more problems. When we brought him home, we were scrambling to find enough goat's milk for him. He has 8 oz added to each feeding and we feed him every 2 hours around the clock. Luckily, we found this product on Amazon and now we have plenty of a high quality goats milk in a form that will last for months until reconstituted. Thanks, Amazon, for carrying this great product.

I was disappointed at first when the shipment was going to take a couple weeks to arrive; but surprizingly, it showed up after about a week. They locked in at the best price and also sold me on free shipping. Can't argue with that!

review/summary: Not just for toddlers
review/text: Many years ago, I developed a taste for goat milk. I don't what what it is about it, a little "gamie," I guess, and not quite as much as sheep milk. (Truth be told, I've never had sheep milk, but the cheese therefrom, over and above it's astromomical cost, doesn't do that much for me).<br /><br />Some of the bottled goat milk is quite expensive, and doesn't quite have the goat taste as much as I like.<br /><br />This powered milk is the tastiest of the goat milks. And, because it's powdered, you can store it for quite a while.<br /><br />People have tole me that it's "better for you" than cow's milk, and I haven't researched that, nor do I care as much as I do for my preference for the taste of goat milk.<br /><br />This stuff is wonderful, just a little of a hassle to mix and cool. (Without that minor hassle, I'd probably give it five stars).<br /><br />Really, try it. It'll grow on you!

review/summary: Perfect for ECZEMA Baby/Toddler!
review/text: My daughter has eczema, a debilitating skin condition (imagine being itchy ALL THE TIME).  From food-log and allergy testing, we knew she was ALLERGIC TO COW MILK, SOY, EGG, and some others.<br />This made formula hunting very difficult, as they usually contain one or the other, and she did not take anything other than breast milk, so I was on a lovely vegan AND soy-free diet.  Well, still am.<br /><br />Now that we are in the process of weaning, I needed to find a supplimental milk ASAP.  We heard good things about goat milk, so we gave this company a go, although they're not 'organic'.<br />Well, my 1-year old daughter LOVES it, and so do I!<br /><br />Texture, taste, consistency of the product are all great: highly recommended!!

review/summary: Powdered milk
review/text: Hey, this was a surprise.  I keep having trouble finding my goat's milk in town, everyone seems to be sold out at the same time, and the Safeway stopped carrying it all together.  My girl friend teased me about buying the milk on Amazon.  That's how I found this, and thought, why not give it a try.  Alas, it is still powdered milk.  If you are familiar with cow powdered milk and hate the smell of it as I do, you will recognize the smell in this milk.  The big surprise was that it actually tasted good and the smell went away after getting thoroughly mixed.  It still had little clumps that refused to dissolve, but it didn't smell icky and tasted just like the real thing.<br />As a side note, I also discovered Goat's milk freezes well, so I've been doing that and saving the powdered stuff for emergencies.

review/text: I don't like milk, unless it is in my coffee. Well, this goat milk made a milk lover out of me. I can't believe how good this tastes, and to my surprise it does not have the "goat" after taste. I have tried goat milk before, twice bought at different stores. But it had the "goat" taste to it and just overall turned me off. After reading the reviews, I initially bought this for my infant, to use in cereals instead of whole milk, but I think this will now become a staple in our pantry. It mixes well and tastes good even warm. I highly recommend this!

review/text: If you are a licorice lover and if you like caramel, this is for you! I had never seen this combination until I came across them at another website while placing an order for something else there.  I ordered a tin and fell in love with them immediately.  Of course, when I went back for more, they were no longer available.  No worries, as usual, Amazon came through and for a better price!  Although it sounds unusual, and although they don't have a strong caramel flavor, the combination works well. Reminds me of my favorites in the Allsorts packages, those square ones that are coated with pink, white or orange. Now I don't have to buy the assortment just to get those few of my favorites, I can get these by the pound.  I definitely recommend trying these, you can keep them all for yourself (because you really will eat them faster than you think) or give some to friends in a pretty jar, they are really unique!

review/text: If you are like me and trying to stick to a gluten-free diet, then I'm sure you've been looking for ways to make a good pizza.  Pizza was something I wasn't willing to give up, and with this product, I don't have to!  One bag makes enough dough for several large pizzas, or like me, you can use what you need, then keep the rest refridgerated for several days.  Having a pack of 4 means I don't have to run out.  I think it's pretty good, easy to make up (it comes with its' own yeast) and not bad considering it's GF.

review/summary: Best pizza crust yet!
review/text: My husband has celiac disease and often used to joke that, instead of going out for beer and pizza, he now has to go out for wine and salad. ;-)<br /><br />All this changed, however, when I stumbled on Bob's GF Pizza Crust at Target one day.  We tried a pack and were hooked.  Then, I discovered Amazon's subscribe and save option and pizza once again became an economical, weekly dinner treat.<br /><br />As with most GF baking, it takes a few tries to get the hang of making the perfect pizza crust.  As many other reviewers have noted, the dough is very sticky and will not roll out.  My husband divides the dough into two crusts and freezes one (unbaked) for another day.  He presses the dough onto a pizza pan covered with parchment paper (or waxed paper), and then after baking for ten minutes, is able to slide the partially cooked crust off the pan and directly onto the oven rack for further crisping.<br /><br />We highly recommend this product!

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised when I made this pizza. Wasnt a big hassle to make and tasted great! Its not like the thin crust you buy at the store, but more homemade like a grandma pizza in Italy. My bf who isnt celiac and basically has to change his diet because of me was raving how good it was, he wanted to keep eating more of it. Its fun to make your own toppings and add different cheeses. Ive been to gourmet gluten free pizza places and this tasted just as good for much much less. I give it 2 thumbs up and I will keep buying this product. Thanks for making a celiac girl feel like she can have pizza again!

review/summary: Fantastic Pizza!!!
review/text: My teenager surprised me with a gluten free pizza from Bob's Red Mill. This is the best gluten free pizza dough! It is different from a wheat gluten dough, however it looks like wheat pizza, but the ingredients are so much healthier! If you follow the instructions it will be a success! After many years with no pizza, I will now enjoy pizza again. Thank you Bob's Red Mill!

review/text: After trying several frozen and commercially-prepared gluten free pizzas, I've finally found a winner. The crust is easy to prepare, bakes perfectly every time, and tastes delicious. I like that there are two crusts per bag of mix, too. Try this if you're looking for a quick, good, gluten-free crust.

I really couldn't tell that I was eating gluten free.  I was surprised since I found Bob's All Purpose flour to be completely inedible.

The texture and taste of this crust are fantastic. No weird aftertaste, no odd graininess. Remembering to wet your hands when you pat out the dough is the only trick.

review/summary: Best GF Pizza Crust EVER
review/text: This is hands down the best GF pizza crust out there. I've found that if you follow the directions exactly you'll end up with a pizza crust that tastes better and has a better consistency than any you can order at any GF restaurant (in the tri-state area, at least). Also, you can make it deep dish or thin crust and the crust holds up either way. I've never come across GF pizza in any restaurant that isn't thin crust so now having the ability to have a thicker, more substantial crust is excellent. Bottom Line: if you're on a GF diet and you love pizza, buy this crust. Just a hint, the sauce you use (in any pizza) makes a huge difference in taste. I think the best sauce out there is Rao's but it can be a bit pricey ($11/bottle or plus) but you can catch it on sale at Stew Leonard's for either $7 or 2 for $12. I'm gonna' try making a calzone so I'll update regarding that once I do.

It was gloppy, stuck to the pan terribly, had a terrible texture once cooked, and didn't resemble a pizza crust in any way. I am a very good baker and cook and never have a recipe just flop, but this was beyond my help. It did make more than one pizza crust; I'll give them that, but the crust was not worth the trouble and didn't taste good, so why would I want another one lying around? Save your money and buy a Chebe mix. They are wonderful.

review/text: We are huge fans of Bob's red mills products. Their variety and quality are un-comparable. How ever I had a different experience with this product. We got this product 2 weeks ago and invited few of our friends and family to have an evening party. We made 13 pizzas, (all vegetarian, no meat) and each and every on who ate it got sick(at least 20 of them). The symptoms varied from indigestion, throwing up, breathing trouble etc. Well the party was a disaster and we had to take medications to get the situation under control. I don't know if the problem was with just 1 batch of their product. I reported it to customer service and they issued a full refund.<br /><br />I wish there was way in their site to report the batch numbers so that the product company gets alerted.

I thought I'd give this a try instead of purchasing several ingredients to make my own "special gluten-free" flour.  Very disappointed.  I was expecting pizza crust that would taste ALMOST like the real thing.  Just not worth the hassle of baking 7 - 9 minutes - THEN putting toppings on and baking another 15 - 18 mins.<br /><br />I guess I will just get Digornio Crisply Flatbread Tuscan Chicken pizzas once in a while.  They are much, much lower in carbs and take about 16 - 17 mins to bake AND taste great.<br /><br />I would not buy this again - I have 3 unopened bags that I would sell if I was able to sell a partial box on Amazon.

review/text: My children have multiple food allergies, so I am always trying differnt products to find replacements for the normal childhood fun foods. I was disappointed by this dough, It was a wet dough, was just a blob that you sort of pushed around on the pan with no possibilty of making a shape. I did not have trouble with it sticking to the pan. The dough made a thick crust. The texture was not soft or airy, but was crumbly like a biscuit and it had no rise. We are not able to eat eggs, so we replaced it with a flax egg but that just made it look like a whole wheat crust. This is definetly a product we will not but again.

review/summary: My favorite mix so far
review/text: This is my favorite gluten free pizza mix so far.  I prefer thinner crusts (almost the cracker crisp type crust),  but I'll probably never achieve that with gluten free pizza.  This is the closest thing I've found, however.  I had to experiment a bit to get it right.  This mix makes TWO pizzas, and I use a very large 14" pan  (actually, closer to 16 inches when you include the edges, which curve upwards.)  If you were using a much smaller pizza pan, you might get 3 pizzas out of the mix.<br /><br />I do the mix exactly as per the instructions, let it rise the recommended 30 minutes, THEN I divide the dough into two equal parts.  One part I usually save and refrigerate (in a bowl and topped tightly with either foil or saran wrap) and I've used it up to two or three days later with perfect results.  Then the other half I'll use the day I make it, since I usually only want to do one at a time.  After the dough has risen (it only seems to rise slightly) , I grease the pizza pan  using Crisco...my preference, and I like the results better.  I don't roll it out.  Rather, I put the blob of dough in the center, and use my  hands to punch it down and push it outwards around the pan, bit by bit.  So my hands don't stick to the dough too much, I use a gluten free flour mix such as the Amy's baking mix on my hands as much as needed, so probably a bit of this will get worked in as I spread the dough  out in the pan.  The dough would be impossible to roll out in my opinion, or at least, I don't want to mess with it due to the relative stickiness of the dough.  After the dough is all evenly spread thru the pan and with a bit of an edge, I poke some fork holes around the bottom here and there.  Then I bake the bare crust for about 10 to 12 minutes in the oven at 425...it will be faintly starting to brown at this point.  This pre-cooking is important for gluten free crusts!  Remove from oven, let it cool about 5 minutes, then put on your desired toppings.  With everything on, it goes back into the oven for less than 10 minutes...just to heat everything up and melt the cheese, basically.  The crust will brown a bit more in the process.<br /><br />Even done in such a large pan, the crust isn't as thin as you'd expect, but you avoid the soggy bottom so common to GF crusts.  My whole family loves this pizza and the wheat eaters of the family don't really notice or care about the difference in the crust.  The taste is quite nice, it has that usual yeast flavor of a wheat crust, and there are no weird rice flour tastes at all.  If anything, it's somewhat bland, but that's probably a good thing for a gluten free crust.

review/summary: This is the best
review/text: This is the best I've tried.  one bag makes me two LARGE rectangular cookie sheet pizzas.  You don't even have to wait for it to rise, it is just as good.  I use my breadmaker to mix it and start the rise usually.  I grease up two LARGE rectangular cookie sheets, the ones with a side that comes up almost an inch high, with olive oil;  I then have a bowl of cold water to keep dipping my hands in, so they don't stick.  pick up half the batch for one pizza with wet hands, add more water, roughly roll into a log, put in pan and take your time pressing down and pushing it to the sides and corners, keep adding water to keep non-stick.  The trick for me is to make it as thin as possible.  Follow directions for pre-cook, and then add ingredients and finish cooking.  Comes out very good.  I've only had better at a restaurant in Worcester MA, Boynton's - awesome.<br /><br />This pizza, I"ll eat 3 or 4 pieces and then freeze the rest.  It heats up fine in the microwave, wrapped in paper towels, 3 or 4 pieces at a time for the next few weeks.  YUM!<br /><br />I use "subscribe and save" with my amazon PRIME account, for free second day shipping, PLUS an additional 15% off.  Can't beat it.  I just set the frequency to 6 months and manually renew it whenever i run out.

review/text: This is a good gluten and soy free mix.  I've found most GFSF mixes that people rave about not to be any good without eggs.  This one holds together OK when made with egg replacer or flax seed meal as suggested on the package, but recently I've found it to be even better when I added 1/4 tsp xanthan gum (to the dry mix) on top of that.  To make thin crust, I put the dough on a greased pan (without holes), brush the top with a little oil and cover with a sheet of parchment paper (or plastic wrap), then roll out with a rolling pin.  Carefully and slowly lift the cover sheet and pre-bake the crust according to the instruction, then you can make a pretty good pizza.  I do make my own mix from time to time, but this is the mix I use when my stash runs out and I am short on time.

I like to add some italian seasoning to the dry part of the mix before I combine the wet & dry ingredients for some extra flavor.  Even the pizza eaters not on a gluten-free diet like this pizza crust. All in all a good one!  And a decent price too!

review/summary: GF Pizza mix really works
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0676C">Bob's Red Mill  Gluten Free Pizza Crust Mix, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> works beautifully giving me wheat-free PIZZA. I'd been without pizza pie for so very long and going pizza free was one of the hardest parts of becoming gluten free. Now I make pizza every week!<br /><br />GF foods are never going to act exactly like the wheat varieties, you probably know that by now. When I roll this soft dough on my pizza stone, my hands and roller must be wet with water. A gentle touch is all it needs. I find that using a circular motion as my final move gives me a little 'ditch' to catch any errant sauce.<br /><br />The dough bakes a few minutes without toppings. I find pricking the dough with a fork prevents excess rising. After this first baking, I think one could fill half and fold over for a large calzone, but I've not tried this yet. Normally I top with a Picante sauce, precooked sausage, broccoli, sliced carrots, onions, peppers of several varieties and whatever else is handy. As I'm also casein/dairy sensitive, I use Nutritional Yeast in place of cheese. NY will never be stringy as it's a powder; but it adds a unifying color and extra 'cheezy' taste. The second baking is about 15 minutes. Because my 'cheese' cannot bubble, I use steaming and color of the crust's edge as my done guides.<br /><br />One box of mix makes two crusts. I freeze the uncooked one for the next week. This way a 4-pack lasts me two months and works perfectly for the auto-ship process.<br /><br />Note: If you use raw shrimp on your pizza... drain them very well and pat dry with paper towel. They are delicious even if you don't :-)<br /><br />Love and Light,<br />Pat

review/summary: I  LOVE this mix!
review/text: Okay, first a few disclaimers...<br /><br />This CAN be a little different to work with, so don't expect the typical, (gorgeous) glutenous, stretchy feel that happens with wheat crusts... (sigh.)<br />It's GONNA be messy... but don't let that stop you. This crust is delicious, and totally worth it.<br /><br />Here's what I do.<br /><br />I follow the directions on the package, with a few substitutions.<br />First, for more flavor punch, I warm some veggie broth in place of the warm water that is called for. I add the yeast right to this, (taking care that it isn't hotter than 105 degrees F, or it will kill the yeast.) I even throw in a smidge of sugar to nudge the yeast along.<br /><br />Then I mix in the dry indredients, which is basically, the mix. To that, I add a bit of flaxseed meal (You may also use flaxseed meal as a substitute for eggs, as it describes on the pkg.- with tasty results. I find that the flaxseed gives the mix a nice texture, so I will often add a bit in addition to eggs when I am not cooking for my vegan friends.)<br /><br />Don't forget the Xantham Gum! This helps out with the texture... helps to give back some of that lovely "glutenous" feel... Amazon has good prices, so snoop around... don't recommend baking without Xantham or Guar gum. Per another reviewer's suggestion, I tried 1/4 tsp. xantham gum for each 16 oz. pkg. I found that advice to be spot on, and I am so glad I decided to try it! Recommended!<br /><br />Then, I add finely chopped, fresh rosemary leaves from the garden... and I do mean, finely... nobody wants chunk of tree in their pizza.<br />This just elevates the crust, almost gives it a focaccia feel. Yummy.<br /><br />Then, after the pan is greased- one review suggested Crisco, and I think I want to try that next- I sprinkle a course grind of kosher or boutique salt-judiciously- on the pan.<br />See, I went to a wonderful gluten free bakery in Washington State- wish I could remember the name of the place, or I would totally give them the credit- did exactly that... finely chopped rosemary, with the lovely crunch of salty goodness on the bottom of the crust as it was baking.<br />Incredible. You MUST try it!!!!!<br /><br />Like others have stated, I do not roll the crust out. I follow the directions on the pkg, which say to use wet hands (mine were more just damp, so that they didn't get sticky) to smooth the crust into the shape I wanted...<br />Then, I poke my fork around to within an inch of the edge... this helps the perimeter to stay puffier then the center, and helps keep the toppings from sliding off the pizza.<br /><br />As others have said, pre- baking is absolutely essential for gluten free crusts. I should try Alton Brown's trick of brushing the edges with a little egg, see if that helps brown up the edges a little more. So many fun things yet to try!<br /><br />Finally, I think that even though this crust is gluten free, and there are definite differences between GF and "regular" baking... I think what Gramma said still holds... "If the dough is too wet, add more flour..." (I always have a stockpile of extra GF flours on hand, just in case... )<br /><br />If I stumble on any other ideas, I will update promptly.<br /><br />This mix is a great addition to my kitchen, it's quick and easy, and tastes great.. (A bunch of us gals went away for a weekend, and I made pizza- first time- using this mix, and everyone was delighted... a double batched scarfed down quicker than I would have thought possible!)Gluten free success!

review/summary: Good stuff, and not just for pizza
review/text: I originally purchased this product to use for making pizza crust.  It makes a decent GF pizza crust, although with some tinkering, I've improved on it.<br />Why I love this and keep buying it, though, is because I use it in nearly all of my baking.  Because I can get it for such a good price through Amazon's subscribe & save program, I've experimented with using it in other baked goods.<br />Mixed 50/50 with BRM brown rice flour, I can use it in place of all-purpose flour in most recipes, and it works like a charm, AND tastes better.:-)  I simply discard the yeast packets.<br />Hope this helps someone!

review/summary: Grateful, not ecstatic.
review/text: First, a great thing. Before I had a chance to make a pizza, I tried some of this flour to make banana oatmeal cookies. They came out great, just like Mom used to make. I'm so grateful I found that I can use this stuff to do that.<br /><br />As far as making a pizza. I added a little salt and basil to the mix for flavor, made a pizza, and it was pretty darn good. It's really hard to get the "dough" to spread out, I used a wetted rubber spatula and a lot of patience, but got the pan covered. With a homemade sauce, and some cheeses and mushrooms, it was SO good to have a pizza again. Perfect? maybe not, but very enjoyable. I'll do it again. I guess that's the question, isn't it? Would you bother to do it again? So, recommended, try it and see if you can deal with it.

review/summary: A Chewy NY Style Foldable Crust!
review/text: I really thought good NY style pizza was a thing of my pre gluten free past...like Life cereal and licorice. This pizza crust changed that.<br /><br /> The first attempt, near perfect. The second, some changes were made. I let the dough rise overnight in the 'fridge. This gave it an even more elastic texture. I used probably 2-3 tablespoons of water to spread the crust out evenly in the pan but due to par baking...this works well. Don't be afraid to use the water or you may have an unspreadable glob, and not a pizza crust. The resulting pizza is amazing. You can fold the slice without any crumbling, even 2-3 day old leftovers retain their "real" pizza qualities. The topped crust has all the texture and chew I've come to expect in pizza. The un-topped "lip" of crust that forms the pizza has a slight "beany" taste from the bean flour in the mix. I solved that by making a rectangular, southern CT style pizza...totally topped, no crust lip. I will also try adding seasoning and garlic to a crust sometime and see what that does. I'd rather pizza, than no pizza...and this is the best GF pizza mix I have tried to date.

review/summary: Great for pizza crust or a flat bread
review/text: I found this mix to be great for a pizza crust, or a crispy flat bread. The first (we use up to 11 minutes) and second baking times (8 to 12 minutes depending on the number of toppings)in a 425 degree oven will vary with your oven and your preferences.  I also found that you can actually make up to four pizza crusts out of one bag that are about nine inches in diameter. This of course depends on the number of servings that you need at one time, how thick you like the crust (we like a thin crust) and the appetites. The pre-made dough keeps very well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days and if you let the refrigerated dough rest for 30 minutes before the first baking as the directions state, you will get a very nice crispy crust with a soft bread-like center. The pre-baking process allows you to load the pizza up with your favorite toppings (up to five toppings with double cheese and the crust does not get soggy!)and get a nice melt on the cheese with the second baking.  It makes a very tasty flat bread (cover with cheese and your favorite vegetables for the second baking)to serve with soups and heartier stews.  I've tried many different types of pizza crusts including the prepared frozen ones, other mixes and this is the best so far.  If you keep some ready made dough in the refrigerator it makes a great substitute for bread in a pinch!

review/summary: tweak it secret...
review/text: Fantastic!  How to do it: I used the mix + oil and 1 egg + 1 TBSP flaxseed meal (combined w/3Tbsp H2o)...I mixed by hand w wooden spoon until just incorporated (like muffins), added garlic powder along w yeast mixture. Divided into 1/2s, let rise in bowl atop oven as it preheated. Used 1/2 dough on 12" cheap aluminum plate, greased w olive oil. After 8-9 min, removed from oven, flipped pizza over w BIG spatula, then added toppings. Cook another 10-15, then perfect! Even BF loved it,

review/summary: Wet sloppy mess
review/text: The "dough" part is a bit misleading...this is the wettest dough I've ever worked with, even way more so than scone dough.  It's near impossible to work with. If you're hoping for a super thin crust, you won't be able to attain that with this. First of all, it does not really rise, leaving you with wet slop to push apart on the pan. Don't try it on a pizza pan with holes, either. If you keep your hands soaking wet, you may be able to spread it out some but not as thin as I would really like. Once baked, it's a very uneven crust due to the difficulty of spreading it. It also has a bit of a "funky" taste but my husband likes it a lot. It's the only gluten-free pizza crust I've tried thus far, so I have nothing to compare it with.

review/summary: good and bad
review/text: I have been a huge fan of this pizza crust mix since my son was found to be NCGI almost a year ago. However, the last two shipments of this product have had opened packages and flour spilling inside the box. The first one was a minor opening, but the one I just received had over 1/3 of the top seal undone, and a good 1/3 cup of flour was spilled all inside the box. Something needs to be done about quality control of the bag sealing, because improperly sealed bags were what caused both leaks.<br /><br />The dough tastes great, though, and it's easy to work with!!

review/summary: Yummy. If it's gross, you're doing it wrong...
review/text: I have tried several recipes for gluten-free pizza dough, and it's a lot of work. We started using this because it's so much easier than mixing it yourself. I really like this dough. I have read the other reviews and have no idea what they're talking about--this is good stuff. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the bottom doesn't get quite crispy enough, while they edges do. The flavor is good, though!
