review/summary: Wonderful stuff - and gluten-free too!
review/text: I'd had no luck finding a gluten-free brown sugar substitute until I found this on Amazon - and checked the manufacturer's website, which assured me it is gluten-free.  AND mostly xylitol - the sugar substitute I prefer anyway.  So I order one bag to try it, and quickly went back to order more.<br /><br />It's great stuff - more like light brown sugar than dark brown, so I need to add a tad of molasses in some of my baking.  And of course like plain xylitol, it's much drier than sugar, but adding a little applesauce to whatever I'm baking helps with that.<br /><br />But mostly I use it on my breakfast cereal - sprinkling cinnamon in the bottom of the bowl, adding <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TXT502">Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain, Rolled Oats, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> and a handful of raisins, microwaving it, and topping it with Ideal Brown no-cal sweetener.  Yum.

review/text: I am diabetic and have certain recipes calling for brown sugar - so far I have used Ideal in my morning oatmeal and plan on using it  measurements are equal basically. I don't want to resort to using Splenda brown sugar blend because it has some sugar in it.<br />So far so good!

review/summary: Great Substitute for Regular Brown Sugar!
review/text: We are a family with food allergies and we had to find substitutes for the usual sugar replacements.  This was a perfect choice, and when a recipe calls for brown sugar, this is what we use.  It measures just like sugar and has no aftertaste.

review/summary: Made great Peanut Butter Cookies!
review/text: I made peanut butter cookies using 1 cup pb (Skippy Natural Creamy), 1 cup Idealï¿½ No Calorie Brown Sweetener, and 1 egg. My cookies turned out perfect and taste great, especially with a glass of Calorie Countdown milk.<br /><br />According to my calculations, there are 24 grams of carbohydrates in a cup of the brown sugar substitute (I don't count sugar alcohols). I got 20 cookies from my dough so that's barely over 1 gram of carbs per cookie from the Ideal. The egg had less than 1 gram of carbs and the Peanut Butter had 32 grams of carbs in a cup so that's 1.6 per cookie. Total carb count for my cookies is less than 3 grams per cookie. I'm real good with that!

review/text: I love ideal brown sugar substitute. Because it is from sugar alcohols it is natural, and unlike sorbitol or maltitol based substitutes, it doesn't affect my stomach. I use it on oatmeal and in baking to cut down on carbs. There is no aftertaste. My only complaint is that it is not clumpy like real brown sugar and that can sometimes affect baked goods, but so far I have had no problems with it!

Now in less than a month they've hiked the price up from just under $6 per package to $8.99, and no long offer Super Saver Shipping, and charge nearly another $8 for shipping? Save your money.

review/text: this is not what i expected, the bag is big but it looks heavier than it is. this product doesn't have much weight to it at all, and you have to use so much just to notice any sweetness. they say this compares cup for cup with brown sugar, i'm going to have to disagree with that.<br /><br />I also bought the small 50 packets by ideal. and had the opposite effect. I think it is an excellent product. it seems like there's hardly anything in the packet but to me one little packet compares to 2tsp of sugar when i put it in my coffee.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I've had insomnia off and on for the past year +. I've been prescribed just about everything...including the main stuff like ambien. Ambien, unlike what the commercials promote, left me with horrible hangovers, terrible mood swings...and often times I would sleep walk/do things that I didn't even remember. I've also tried in store stuff like tylenol PM or sleep aids you can find in your local drugstore...really, nothing worked. Finally I discovered Dream Water from a random amazon search and found some at Duane Reade. It works (no pun intended) like a dream. I sleep well with little to no hangover at all...no mood swings...and it doesn't knock you out. It slowly relaxes you into a sleep, as it promotes. After all this time...a more natural remedy, and one that's not cheap necessarily, but definitely cheaper. 5 stars, no doubt about it.

review/summary: Works for me - at half dose.
review/text: I am a nurse that works night shift and travels frequently. Between the two, I have a funky sleep schedule and sometimes go through periods of extreme insomnia.<br /><br />Then, at the airport in Long Beach, CA I found Dream Water. I was a little shocked at the price but decided to try it anyway. Because it was expensive, I tried half a shot and it worked, well, like a dream. A whole shot makes me do weird things in my sleep, but a half shot makes me fall asleep and get a good 6-8 hours with no hangover effect - even during my severe episodes of insomnia.<br /><br />As a nurse, I would like to recommend that you be careful taking it every day. One of the ingredients (5-HTP) can cause serotonin syndrome in certain doses. Since we don't know the exact dose they use, I would look up serotonin syndrome and be on the look out for side effects if you take it regularly. Just in case. I haven't had any side effects, but better safe than sorry.<br /><br />Also, be careful mixing it with certain other meds used to adjust mood (anxiety/depression meds) or other sleep aids - even natural ones. Just a heads up.

review/summary: My Hero!!!!
review/text: This is the best stuff on earth!! I don't like medicine- I haven't even taken a Tylenol in years- so it was very hard for me to find a solution for my sleeping problems. Teas are natural, but don't work are all, and pills have nasty side effects. Dream Water is natural and effective!!! I also love that I don't have to count calories, because I do take this regularly.<br />It is powerful enough to help you fall asleep, but mild enough that you can wake up whenever you want to, without leaving you groggy or out of it. Both flavors are great!<br />By it for yourself- and if you want to make other busy/stressed out people very happy (your friends, your parents, your teachers, your coworkers, etc), spread it around!!

It both relaxes me and helps me fall asleep on the nights I am laying awake counting sheep.  It tastes great unlike some of the other products I've tried, I prefer the Snoozeberry flavor myself, but the Lullaby Lemon is just as good.  Finally something that works for me!!!

review/summary: Sweet Dreams!
review/text: I came across this product in a local store by accident and decided to give it a try.  I must say I was more impressed than I thought I would be.  And honestly I didn't think it would work at all.<br /><br />Normally, I lay in bed for a while watching TV until I fall asleep. It sometimes takes me about an hour or better to actually fall asleep even though most mornings I awake at 5am. I wake up several times in the night, for no reason, but generally go back to sleep with no problems. I tend to wake up a little sluggish and not wanting to get out bed. Well I drank the Dream Water, the taste is pleasant, and in about 30 minutes I felt more relaxed.  But I think I was fighting it at first. But as soon as I laid down, I was sleep in time.  I slept through the night.  And woke up refreshed and felt rested and ready to start my day.<br /><br />Of course this shouldn't be used daily but for those days when I think sleep is going to be hard to come by, I keep some Dream Water on hand. Some of the ingredients (this products claims to be all natural) are maybe not for people with high blood pressure. So please pay attention to the label.  But if you have no existing health issues I'd recommend giving it a shot!

review/summary: It even helped ME!
review/text: I suffer from idiopathic insomnia, which is basically lifelong insomnia, every night, with no known cause. I've tried EVERY sleep drug - ambien, trazodone, lunesta, etc. etc. You name it! I HATE taking drugs, especially to sleep. So I'm always looking for a natural alternative. I've tried "sleep shots" in the past, but my body is very sensitive and most of them have tons of different herbs that can cause negative reactions. THIS DOESN'T! This contains only ingredients that are SUPPOSED to be in your body naturally.<br /><br />5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin.<br />GABA is EXTREMELY relaxing and good for an anxious mind (I have been taking GABA supplements for about a year now)<br />Melatonin is something we all know about to help induce sleep.<br /><br />This combination is just what my body wants before bed. Granted, I still have some sleepless nights. In addition to this drink I often will take magnesium and Passion Flower supplements to help calm me. The taste is great, very mild. This product has made a noticeable difference in my relaxation and sleep.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Let's get away from those sleep drugs!

review/summary: First OTC sleep aid that worked for me
review/text: As an insomniac of many years, I picked up a Dream Water at my local pharmacy, where they're sold in individual 2.5-oz bottles in two flavors, Snoozeberry and Lullaby Lemon.  I've tried every over-the-counter sleep aid there is, and some help, some don't -- this stuff really works.  It makes me very drowsy, and far as I can tell, there are no adverse side effects.  Both flavors are subtle and pleasant, and contain no calories.  The active ingredient is sodium 80 mg, which might be of concern to those on a low-sodium diet, although 80 mg only represents 3% of the average adult's recommended intake.  The rest is their "secret blend" of what I presume is the usual herbals that are reputed to relax you. All I know is that I fall asleep within an hour and sleep better through the night with fewer interruptions.<br /><br />One minor complaint -- the stuff's expensive (hence the four stars, rather than five)!  Even if you buy it by the 12-pk, it's about $2 a pop! I guess it deepends, then, on how bad you want to sleep.  I like having the stuff around for when nothing else is working.<br /><br />So that caveat aside, highly recommended!

review/summary: Meyenberg Non-Fat Powdered Goat Milk
review/text: I prefer the regular fat version than the non-fat version.  This non-fat version doesn't taste as good as the fat version.  Also, it's slightly more difficult to mix with water.  I didn't stick with the fat version because I could feel my cholesterol level getting higher.  So I tried this version to prevent the cholesterol from getting any higher.  I had made honey goat milk balls after every meal which tasted delicious.  Then during afternoon breaks I would mix with toasted oatmeal for another delicious treat.  I loved using it but I could feel my cholesterol getting higher and higher.  So I quit cold turkey and now the cholesterol level seems to be back to normal.  The way I test cholesterol is by putting my forehead near my ankles.  If a get a blood-pounding head, my cholesterol is too high.  I took one star away because the fat version is better deserving the 5 star rating.  If you're cutting back weight, then this version is better.

review/text: I tried this mustard at a tasting session in the NBSH store and it totally captured me.  I send spiral-cut hams to out of town family members each Christmas and always include a sweet & spicy mustard.  The ham is great but I get as many comments on the S&S mustard as the ham.

review/summary: Eureka!
review/text: We've always wondered why the Kettle Corn we got at fairs and festivals tasted so much better than what we tried to do at home. We finally learned that Mushroom popcorn makes for a much fluffier, fuller and superior bag of Kettle Corn! Determined to surprise my fiance for the holidays, I started a quest for Mushroom popcorn kernals and finally found JustPoppin. Eureka! I quickly ordered 2 lbs, along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058IBRK6">Stainless Steel Induction Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a> and we've been poppin' up a storm ever since! It took some practice (watch their videos) -- but we quickly mastered homemade Kettle Corn and now laugh every time we pass the grocery store brands. There's simply no comparison. JustPoppin's customer service and support is terrific, too. We've been ordering from them for over a year now and enjoy trying all their new varieties, flavorings and popping techniques!

He did mention the hulls and said "So long as you chew it and NOT try to inhale it, it would be good" and good it was. I only stove top so it was great to see the corn pop up so big, just a handful and it filled up a 24qt bowl (Cause you can't eat good popcorn in a small bowl). Lightly seasoned to taste with salted butter and seasoning salt, Perfect! So I only wrote cause of the knuckleheads that bad mouthed something that I thoroughly enjoyed. Buy a small sample and see for yourself and don't let others keep you from the good stuff...

review/text: I bought a 3lb bag and had it sent to my parents.  They raved that it came out great so I bought a 5lb bag myself.  I have tried it once so far.  I popped 1/4 cup with 1 1/2 tbs of butter flavored canola oil in the 6 qt Lindy's popper.  I followed the instructions that states that you should only toss in a few kernels at the beginning while the oil heats up.  When those three pop, dump in the rest since the oil will be at optimum temperature.  I did so and started to crank away.  All the kernels popped in about 10 seconds since it was a small batch.  Came out fine, but a little chewier than expected because since the kernels were fuller than regular butterfly popcorn.  It did get a little crispier when more steam was allowed to escape.  Flavor was fine with a light bit of popcorn salt.

review/summary: Natural ingredients
review/text: I ordered the Teisseire for making mai-tais after noticing that the Collins orgeat I had been using didn't even list almonds as an ingredient. When it came I had my family do a blind taste test for me. It actually tastes pretty similar to the Collins, both are sweet and taste like almonds. But the Teisseire has an additional nutty or earthy flavor that the Collins does not. It's made from almond extract, not just flavoring, and sugar, not corn syrup, and nothing with a scary chemical name.<br /><br />It does cost almost twice as much, plus shipping, but it takes me months to go through a bottle so it's worth it for me. It has a very nice pour spout that eliminates the crusty buildup you get on a screw-top bottle like Collins. My only complaint is the metal container. You can't see how much is left, and I think glass would be less likely to impart a taste. Right now there is no metallic taste at all, but in six months who knows?<br /><br />Note that the Amazon listing is wrong in a couple ways. The bottle is metal, not plastic, and the name is spelled "Teisseire." Yes, I know it looks plastic in the photo, but it really is metal shaped like that.

review/text: As far as I can tell this is the only "all natural" orgeat available on Amazon.  Here are the ingredients: sugar, water, fructose, almond extract.  Great but how does it compare to the other orgeats?  The only other one I have on hand at the moment is from Fee Brothers.  The Fee Bro. while being pretty good does come across as more "almond-like" than just tasting like actual almonds.  It's almost too sharp.  The Fee Bro. orgeat does contain some orange flavor (again "orange-like" not actual orange).  Teisseire's orgeat  tastes like almonds and it comes through nicely in the cocktails I tried it with (Mai Tai and Japanese).  It doesn't have the orange or rose water that orgeats traditionally have but even without that it tastes better than Fee Brothers'.  The lack of orange water makes it 4 stars instead of 5.

I tried them in various cocktails and Teisseire came in last--a distant last--in every test. Compared with the other two it is thin and its flavor is too weak to stand up to other ingredients in a drink. I do give it bonus points for the nice bottle and pour spout, but it's certainly not worth its price and I do not recommend it for cocktail enthusiasts.

review/text: Alright, I'll preface by saying that I have not had the pricing or expiration (not that I would notice) issues that some of the other reviewers have faced.  The humanity.  I get them every 3 months and the price has always been between 6.50 and 8.50.  This is a tremendous bargain.  One of these boxes at Duane Reade costs $4.99+.  I would probably get it delivered more than once every 3 months if I ate breakfast more.<br /><br />This is by far my favorite cereal, and while I may sound like a child, I'm 27.  Since you're curious, the other members of the Cereal Rushmore are:<br />Cinnamon Toast Crunch<br />Frosted Flakes<br />Corn Pops<br />Honorable Mention: Lucky Charms<br /><br />Boom, done.<br /><br />Update 9/20/12: Now that they got rid of the 3pack, and replaced it with the 4pack, they also jacked the price.  S+S is $18 currently ($4.25 per box).  While I will still buy them, the savings is noticeably less.  Maybe the other reviewers were right all along.

I've been watching this for about 10 days, and I have never seen it the same price two days in a row.  I managed to score mine at about $7 last week, but I'm thinking I just got lucky.

There really isn't anything bad I can say about original Cheerios, but I do prefer Honey Nut Cheerios if I have the option. Also, I am not the biggest honey lover, but the taste in this cereal is not overpowering; it is just right. I really think this is one the best classic cereals on the market. They are fairly healthy, especially since General Mills has started to make all of their cereals with whole grains. These are good for lowering your cholesterol and maintaining a good diet. The amazon price is cheaper than my local store, even without the subscribe and save option. So, I recommend :-)<br /><br />Note: The amazon.com seller has the best price. Some other sellers have it for higher prices on amazon, but you probably wont be getting such a good deal. Enjoy.

I wouldn't say it is life changing, but as far as processed grain cereals go this one is both tasty and lower in sugar with some natural fiber.

If you haven't tried it before, it is definitely a great way to start of your day.<br />Just to make things fair, my personal preference is frosted mini-wheats, but that is to grainy tasting for many people. This product here is much easier to eat and sweeter tasting.

review/summary: Good O's!
review/text: This cereal is a favorite of mine.  Not only does it have the nice honey nut sweetness taste I missed in my younger days, but I love grabbing a handful out of the box and just munching on it whenever as a snack.  When we go to Church, often times you will see little ones grabbing handfuls of HNC from plastic bags their parents prepare and bring w/ them to keep their babes busy and quiet.  Unfortunately, someone has to clean the floors and the crevasses in the pews where there might be an O or two because Honey Nut Cheerios are so popular!

review/summary: convenient and nutritional
review/text: I eat this almost everyday for breakfast because of it's convenience and nutritional value. A word of waring. It is hard on the teeth if you don't "crunch" gently. Many days I just poor it in plastic cup (dry) and eat it on the way to work with a mug of joe. It tastes healthy and sweet.

review/text: My kids love this cereal as they really like this sweet honey nut taste combine with the whole grain flavor. In fact, they love this cereal so much we typically go through 2 to 3 boxes per month. The best part of them liking this cereal is that's it a whole-grain meaning they are eating something nutritious.<br /><br />Recommend.

review/summary: Good taste, convenient place
review/text: It's honey nut Cheerios. Sweet, but not too sweet. This is the type of cereal you can eat with milk or just by itself. Your fingers won't get messy like when you eat cereals with marshmallows and it's easy to grab. All around good stuff.<br /><br /> You can sometimes find it cheaper at the store and certain boxes have promotions where you can get stuff. However having it delivered to your door can be more convenient, especially if you don't have a car or the time to buy groceries.

review/text: I was looking for a convenient way to bulk purchase a number of items, but didn't realize that Amazon sold dry grocery goods. It's really convenient (especially with Amazon Prime) to stock up on this stuff!<br /><br />As for the Cheerios, there's not much to say. They were fresh, came in a shrink-wrap pack of 3, and it was a good deal cheaper than going to a local grocery store in Jersey City. I will definitely be making this purchase again.

review/text: I grew up on Cheerios.  We did not have all the sugary sweet cereals we have today and that was fine. Then Honey Nut Cheerios came along.  I thought they were too sweet in the beginning.  I used to mix them 1/2 &  1/2.  That made them sweet enough for me.<br /><br />I do enjoy them right out of the box, like candy.  It helps with my craving for chocolate.  I always have a box of cheerios in my house to enjoy for breakfast or a snack.

review/text: I love cereal and eat a lot of it. I'm not a fan of regular Cheerios as I think the flavor is very bland and cardboard like. And it's not that sweet and I like at least a little sweetness in my cereals. Honey Nut Cheerios is better because it is sweeter and has a little more flavor. Still it's not one of my favorites and I don't buy it that often.

Between this and Kashi GoLean Crunch, I don't have to feel guilty about giving my kids "bad" cereal.<br /><br />From a price perspective, you can't beat Amazon's Subscribe & Save. My family of six will work through these three boxes pretty quick. Thanks Amazon!

review/text: I started ordering the pack of 3 cheerios using the subscribe and save option 6 months ago and the price was reasonable.  It worked out great for a few months and then amazon changed their pricing and it went from ~$7.00/3 boxes to ~$11.00.  I don't know how they can justify a price hike of $4.00 in one month.  I have canceled this subscribe and save option ... along with a couple others.  A reminder to whomever reads this -- when they send you an email reminding you of an order coming soon --pay attention to the previous and the current pricing.  It got me the first month --not paying attention.

review/summary: Product likely contains GMO corn
review/text: This used to be one of my favorite breakfast cereals, until I learned about GMOs (genetically modified organisms).  Honey Nut Cheerios contains "modified corn" as the second ingredient, and since they do not specify "organic" or "non-GMO", and corn is one of the most genetically modified crops in our country, there is a high probability this cereal contains GMOs.  We typically only trust companies who specify on the packaging that they source non-gmo ingredients or have a company statement that they do not use GMOs, such as Barbara's Bakery and Annie's.  Amazon has an incredible selection of organic and/or non-GMO cereals and breakfast products!  [...]
