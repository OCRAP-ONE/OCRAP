review/summary: WOW!
review/text: I'll be honest, I thought this was a bit pricey, but I really like herbal teas with good flavor that can stand on its own and doesn't need sweetener. So I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed.<br />You read the ingredients, they seem so simple:<br />Organic Lemongrass, Organic Schizandra Berries, Organic Roses, and Organic Clove.<br />It must be those berries because this has got to be one of my favorite teas of all time. The flavor is quite distinct, yet delicate. If you like herbal teas or know someone that does, I highly recommend this as a treat.

review/summary: Morton & Bassett Organic Parsley, a High Quality Product
review/text: I have used their organic bay leaves and was thoroughly impressed. Without any hesitation I decided to try their organic parsley flakes.  Needless to say the quality is as high as I had anticipated. Their organic parsley flakes are a delicious garnish or addition to vegetables, meats, and fish. (For example mashed carrots with parsley topping is so delicious!) It is organic and very carefully prepared and handled so you know that you are getting top quality. I highly recommend this product.

review/text: This is a perfect, on the go, refreshing beverage. I love the chocolate flavor. It is nice and rich/smooth without being too rich. This is low fat and has only 100 calories. This is easy to chill and throw in a lunch box or work bag. It is enough for a quick burst of energy without a crash mid-morning or mid-afternoon. I feel good about giving this to my kids since they do not ever get soda or any other junky drinks.

review/summary: Carrageenan?  "Natural" flavor?
review/text: Wow... talk about false and misleading advertising. Anyone in the know, knows carrageenan is considered carcinogenic... aka a cancer causing substance. And what about this "natural" flavor? Hey, arsenic is also "all natural" as is cyanide. In other words, simply because something is called "natural" does not mean it's good for your body.<br /><br />Sorry Pacific Natural... your products are anything but. And it's a statement about how you try to fool your customers with your misleading labeling. I'll pass.

review/summary: Decent flavor but no calcium
review/text: I'm comparing this to Blue Diamond's almond chocolate drink.  It gets bonus points for convenience as the only size I can find Blue Diamond in is 32oz, and these 8oz packages are very handy.  As far as the flavor goes it's good, but not as sweet as Blue Diamond (which makes sense since it has 25% less sugar).  Initially that turned me off, but I got used to it quickly.  I'm marking it down a star though for it's lack of calcium (even though if you look closely at the photo, you can see that it says "excellent source of calcium"---they must have reformulated.)

review/summary: Good stuff for the price
review/text: I was searching for something for my girls' school lunches and wanted a change from milk or juice boxes. They like almond milk, so I thought this would be a nice change. It proved a tad difficult for them to open by themselves and some boxes did not sit flat on the table as other milk brands do (horizon & organic valley). One daughter ended up wearing her milk as a result and it did not wash out of her clothes on a couple occasions. Although it tastes good and the price is right, we won't be purchasing more for lunchboxes.

review/summary: Delicious and Perfect Fit
review/text: This is my second order of this great pack of Pacific Natural Foods Organic Almond Non-Daily Beverage. After doing a lot of research for healthy chocolate flavored drinks that are were non dairy, this was the best of all the findings.<br /><br />PROS: Scruptious. Rich, thick, and pleases the tongue and mouth. Small and perfect sizing (though I drink 2 boxes). If you've had kidney failure or medical restrictions, this was wonderful to find! Often, with kidney restrictions, you can NOT have high protein, which both dairy and SOY drinks have. This has close to zero grams of protein. Also, if you're a vegan, dairy free. Gluten free. cholesterol free, 0% iron, which I have to look out for too. Doesn't have to be refrigerated. Natural ingredients (nothing artificial).<br /><br />CONS: Product is hard to find, at least anywhere locally. Amazon is great since it qualifies for free s&h, where other places charge way too much. If you have healthy kidneys would be disappointed how there is no protein or calcium. Low in vitamins/minerals (which can be good in way that not artificially added). If you write to the company, don't expect a response! I tried writing twice with compliments and questions; never responded to me. Also, straws don't work too well- end up peeling tab at opening and sip/pouring in rest.<br /><br />Overall, two thumbs up. Enjoy!

It doesn't have a ton of nutrition but if you are looking for something to put in the kids lunch box besides juice everyday, I think they will appreciate it! It does taste just like the Yahoo chocolate drink but is made with much more trustworthy ingredients. Does not need refrigeration but says to serve chilled. The end point is try this for a change and it's something different and enjoyable for any age.

review/summary: Good Packaging and Nutritional Content
review/text: I've been drinking regular almond milk for about a year, the plain unsweetened (which I don't enjoy that much), plain sweetened (great) and vanilla, which is great too.  I found that the chocolate almond milk was quite delicious.  One of the things I like most about this product is that it is packaged in an 8oz individual serving.  This is nice because if it came in a larger size, I don't think I'd be able to consume it all in such a short time.  Each container has a straw attached to it and you poke it through a foil cover.  The product description describes the containers as "pouches" but they're the hard cardboard-like "pouch" so they're quite durable.  The milk I received has an expiration date of about 10 months from when I purchased it, so I'll have plenty of time to consume it.  I also had the milk shipped to Italy and it arrived without any damage or leakage.<br /><br />1 individual container, 8 oz (serving) contains:<br />Calories  100<br />Fat Cal  25<br />Sodium  140mg<br />Potassium 130mg<br />Carb.  19g<br />Fiber  1g<br />Sugars  16g<br />Protein  1g<br /><br />Vitamin A 10%<br />Vitamin D 25%<br />Riboflavin 30%

review/summary: Great alternative to regular organic milk and organic soy
review/text: I can only eat and drink organic so finding this made my life. I love having a little bit of chocolate treats here and there and this is nice to have and you feel a bit less guilty because it's healthier for you. It's organic, it tastes great - not too chocolatey or sweet but just right. It does have a unique taste and I like to alternate between the organic chocolate soy milk I get at the supermarket and this for a change in pace. When I get tired of one, I buy the other. Does not need to be refrigerated before opening but is always great chilled. Usually it disappears before you can even start enjoying it, haha. Highly recommend the try. Over all Pacific Natural and Organic foods are a trusted organic company and I have had no problems with them.

review/summary: Where is the nutritional value? Pretty much 100 calories of sugar & fat
review/text: Outside of taste and people with soy issues, I haven't found a reason to drink almond milk. There is only 1g of protein and fiber in it. How do you take almonds which have fair amounts of both and suck them all out to make a drink? There's not a lot of calcium or other nutrients as well. So most of the calories is coming from sugar and fat. I just don't see the appeal. Same goes for rice milk.<br /><br />I'd stick with soy milk if you don't have an intolerance to soy. Just find a brand who's flavor you like. I'm rather fond of Westsoy and Trader Joe's personally.

review/summary: Good Energy with No Jitters for me
review/text: Despite it's juvenile sounding name, this isn't a child's energy drink that's for sure. Each tube packs about 42,000% the recommended daily dose of Vitamin B12. The high from this is extremely stable and hasn't yet given me the jitters.  Everyone reacts differently though so to guarantee 100% that you will not get the jitters would be a lie.  When I take it, I feel very awake, alert, and clear headed. I use it before a workout and several of the ingredients make it perfect for the gym. The let down is probably the smoothest you'll find among energy drinks. And if you feel a cold coming on, downing one of these may help tremendously.<br /><br />The name comes from the interaction the mix has with water. You pour one vile into a 16-20 oz bottle of water and the stuff fizzes like crazy! If you don't get the lid on fast enough, you'll quickly find there will be a mess! I've found using a wide mouthed nalgene bottle is the best way to prevent these types of accidents.<br /><br />In addition to the massive amounts of Vitamin B12, it has a good amount of Vitamin C (500mg), Niacin (10mg), Vitamin B6 (2.5mg), Calcium (60mg), Magnesium (100mg), and Potassium (905mg). It has almost every water soluble vitamin meaning that a lot of the excess that your body doesn't utilize, will be flushed through your kidneys. With that being said, drink a lot of liquid with this and don't over use the product (company recommends no more than 3 a day) or the chance of getting kidney stones exists.<br /><br />It has a 317mg "proprietary" blend blend of L-Arginine, L-Taurine, Caffeine from guarana, Alpha-lipoic acid, Grape seed extract, Green tea leaf extract, Ginger root, and Ginseng root. I don't know how much each compound contributes to the 317mg but they do acknowledge that 100mg of it is caffeine (about the same as a cup of coffee).<br /><br />There are multiple flavors but I'm partial to Grape and Orange Soda. The flavors are very sweet and candy-like but they surprisingly have no sugar. 10 total Calories and only 2g Total Carb.<br /><br />This is an excellent product and recommend it over any other energy drink.

You pour one vile into a 16-20 oz bottle of water and the stuff fizzes like crazy!  If you don't get the lid on fast enough, you'll quickly find there will be a mess!  I've found using a wide mouthed nalgene bottle is the best way to prevent these types of accidents.<br /><br />In addition to the massive amounts of Vitamin B12, it has a good amount of Vitamin C (500mg), Niacin (10mg), Vitamin B6 (2.5mg), Calcium (60mg), Magnesium (100mg), and Potassium (905mg).  It has almost every water soluble vitamin meaning that a lot of the excess that your body doesn't utilize, will be flushed through your kidneys.  With that being said, drink a lot of liquid with this and don't over use the product (company recommends no more than 3 a day) or the chance of getting kidney stones exists.<br /><br />It has a 317mg "proprietary" blend blend of L-Arginine, L-Taurine, Caffeine from guarana, Alpha-lipoic acid, Grape seed extract, Green tea leaf extract, Ginger root, and Ginseng root.  I don't know how much each compound contributes to the 317mg but they do acknowledge that 100mg of it is caffeine (about the same as a cup of coffee).<br /><br />There are multiple flavors but I'm partial to Grape and Orange Soda.  The flavors are very sweet and candy-like but they surprisingly have no sugar. 10 total Calories and only 2g Total Carb.<br /><br />This is an excellent product and recommend it over any other energy drink.

review/summary: excellent
review/text: After using Zipfizz for a year, I've been amazed at what it offers me.  I get sustained mental alertness and energy with no crash or fatigue.  It doesn't affect my sleep, and I find that it is easier to get up in the morning the day after taking Zipfizz.  You don't even have to use a whole tube if you're cost-conscious.  Sometimes, I use a half tube and find I get the results I need.  I will never drink Red Bull or Monster again.  This stuff is great.<br /><br />FYI, this thing is loaded with Vitamin B12 - as much as getting a Vitamin B shot from your doc.  Please avoid taking more than one or two tubes a day, because too much potassium can overload and be detrimental to your kidneys.

review/summary: Haven't been sick in TWO years thanks to Zipfizz
review/text: This drink is just wonderful.  Although it has caffeine, it doesn't have an alarming amount.  The great thing about this drink is all of the vitamins (I'm not good about taking a multivitamin...).  I drink this fairly diluted; with at least 32 ounces of water instead of 16 ounces and the flavor is just right.  The citrus is my favorite and, sadly, they don't carry that at Costco anymore.  I've been drinking only one Zipfizz daily and work in a school -- a huge breeding ground for germs and viruses -- and haven't been sick in the two years I've been drinking this.  Pretty impressive.  And it is WAY cheaper than a cup of coffee at Starbucks :)

This is the only product I have ever used that has no crash associated with it.  A friend of mine is a dietician and she reviewed the ingredients and states that this is about the healthiest energy product out there.

review/text: Just tried my first one and this caffeine addict with very high tolerance can seriously feel the effects and I am not even done with it! High marks for flavor too. The packaging will be very effective at keeping the stuff 'fresh' and will allow you to carry it around without the little packets opening in your bag. You can also re-close it if you do not want the full serving. The old stuff I used was a tablet that was individually foil wrapped and did just fine too and was much less wasteful. Each serving is in a thick rigid plastic tubes that will be around in the landfill for eons! They are #5 type plastic which is technically recyclable but is almost never accepted (think tupperware container) at local recycling centers. I hope the manufacturer will find a better solution to packaging this awesome stuff!

review/summary: Great drink! Grows on you.
review/text: To be honest, I was at first skeptical about this drink.  In my mind, an energy drink had always been any drink with sugar and caffeine levels as high as seen in Monster and Redbull.  My mother one day brought this home from Costco and told me to try it out.<br /><br />It took me probably 2 or 3 drinks to get used to the taste. It wasn't that it was terrible. I guess the "problem" when I started out was that the taste was just a bit different from what I'm used to.  But I have to tell ya this company did a great job sweetening the drink without using sugar or some other artificial crap that's seen in others.  Once you get used to this drink you find yourself popping one out casually once a day.<br /><br />That being said I've noticed that this drink doesn't have the same type of boost you get with caffeine.  The problem with Red Bull and coffee is that the caffeine, while kicking in a lot faster than this drink, also causes you to crash and burn several hours later just as quickly.  This drink however doesn't have that effect.  It gives me a subtle yet noticeable boost for several hours before giving me a "gentle landing" back to where I usually would be without the drink.<br /><br />Anyhow, that's where I am.  Down to 5 tubes and hunting for any deals on this at Costco and here.

( But i'm sure you will feel weird if you drink it too fast.)<br /><br />Cons: a little on the expensive side, but far better deal than red bull or coffee from a store.<br />  mixing the powder adds 1 or two extra steps in the morning.<br /><br />Bottom line: I like this product.

I find that I have received the same pick-me-up that I was getting from 500-600mg of caffeine.  While ZipFizz does have 100mg of caffeine, it does not come with the same 'crash' that caffeine delivers.<br /><br />The pink lemonade flavor is, by far the best flavor I have had.  You can customize the sweet-tartness level by adding more or less water.  I recommend everyone try this product and you will be instantly hooked! Yaaaaay ZipFizz!

review/text: I have been using ZipFizz for about 6 months now and I love it.  I am partial to the Grape and Orange, the Pink Lemonade was just a bit sour for me.  I only take one a day and right before I go to the gym.  I compare this to Advocare's "Spark" drink and this product is WAY CHEAPER but contains just about the same things!  Awesome for those on a budget.<br />Some may be confused by what seems like an excess of vitamins on the ingredient label.  But any that you dont use up in the day get flushed from your body though your kidneys.  DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN 3 a day it says on the vile, but I only need one in the morning to help me rip though my workouts.<br /><br />I do not drink caffine in any other form because I am very sensitive to it. But with this drink I have not had a problem, I thought that it would make me jittery or feel awful, but this product does no such thing!  After the gym I am good to go though the time I get home and I sleep fine!

review/text: I have been drinking ZIPFIZZ for a couple of weeks now.  So far my favorite flavor is the Orange.  At first I drank it like medicine... just for the energy.  Now I look forward to it.<br /><br />I was usually very groggy in the AM.  I drank several cups of coffee to wake up, and then I was anxious for the rest of the day.  I was in Sam's one day and there was a lady demonstrating ZIPFIZZ.  I tasted it and it wasn't too bad so I bought a box for 18 dollars.  I have been drinking it almost every day since.<br /><br />I drink half a serving every morning.  It works very quickly for me, and I am not jittery afterwards.  I have more energy and I am even more productive.  My mind is even clearer.<br /><br />I would recommend ZIPFIZZ to anyone looking for energy without the jitters of other energy drinks.  And Sam's seems to have the best price so far.

review/summary: Great substitute for Pepsi and other sodas
review/text: I am a Pepsi addict who is trying to reform. Zipfizz is being a big help in that process. It's easy to carry around, and when I eat out, I ask for an extra glass of water "to mix with my vitamins." I request a separate glass of ice to be added once it is mixed up. Be sure to drink the water down one to two inches from the rim so the fizz has somewhere to go! One of the things I love about soda is the fizz and the "burn" as it goes down my throat. There's just enough fizz in this stuff to give me some of those sensations, and to help me avoid sodas. I don't drink Zipfizz for the energy, and can't say I've noticed any increase in energy, or relief from fatigue, but that's not what I'm drinking it for!  I LOVE the grape flavor. It reminds me almost exactly of the Grapette I loved as a child. I had been craving it for years, but couldn't find any. Zipfizz Grape really works for me. The orange flavor reminds me of Orange Crush. Sometimes I use about half orange juice, half water to mix it with. That makes it taste more "orangy," and mellows it out a bit.  Citrus and Pink Lemonade are decent flavors, too. I usually add a little extra lemon juice to them, just for more kick. Occasionally, I add a splash of Diet 7-Up or Sprite, or other lemon-lime soda just to change it up a little. Yum!!<br /><br />I buy the grape and orange flavors at my local Sam's Club for about $20 per box of 20. Those are the only two flavors they carry. Citrus and Pink Lemonade, I have to buy online.<br /><br />Thanks to Zipfizz, I'm now drinking about two to four Pepsi*s a week instead of one or two a day!<br /><br />I love the little tubes that Zipfizz comes in, and save them to reuse. They are great for carrying aspirin, or other pills. I take the labels off once I've used the Zipfizz, and put on plain labels so I can mark what I have filled the tubes with. Some I use for the powdered CranAloe drink I take. The tubes are also useful for holding little safety pins, straight pins and needles, toothpicks, salt and/or pepper, sweetener, craft beads, etc. I filled one with my favorite seasoned salt so I can carry it to use when I eat out. At Halloween, I don't give out candy ... I give out the freebies I collect all year long ... bookmarks, keychains, pens and pencils, rulers, kid's meal toys, note pads, AND these little tubes. The kids love them!!

review/summary: Sunshine in a bottle!
review/text: This drink makes me feel like sunshine! Some mornings are hard for me to get up; I feel heavy, slow and sluggish both mentally and physically. And if it's dark outside in the winter, it is even more difficult for me to get out of bed. Zipfizz helps me to "wake up" so I can get started on my day instead of conking out under the covers because I couldn't get out of bed fast enough once I've turned my alarm off. I've always used Zipfizz. I didn't know there was a letdown until I tried 5 Hour Energy which kicked in for about 2.5 hours and then I started feeling sluggish again. Zipfizz gives you enough to help your own body to get itself going so that it can keep going.<br /><br />The taste is nothing great though. Don't buy the powdered drink mix. Buy the drink shot (the tubes) instead to get through it quickly.

review/text: Zipfizz is a great tasting easy to use energy drink.  The price per unit is less expensive than other bottled energy drinks.  Just mix it into a 12 or 16 oz bottle of purified water and shake.  One word of caution, you need to take a couple of swigs from your water bottle before you pour in the Zipfizz, or you will have an eruption of the flavored mix, two or three tablespoons should be adequate.  My favorite flavors are the Berry and Grape.

I also like how I can fill up a bottle with it instead of having a shot like those other drinks. I like to enjoy it and sip slowly, not just shoot it down and be done with it. I also feel slowly drinking an energy drink evenly will lead to a longer buzz and energetic feeling with less comedown. A+++ for this product.

review/summary: Great energy booster
review/text: Ultimately, I think personal preference is going to play the main role in whether or not you will like Zipfizz over any other energy drink.  That said, here is what I have experienced<br /><br />Energy Boost<br />For me it gives a nice boost of energy, equivalent to a full cup of coffee.  It seems to last around 5 hours for me without a crash at the end.  I think this is where individuals will have the most variance, as caffeine reacts differently in different people depending on the product.  For example, I don't like what a Diet Coke does to me but I like this.<br /><br />Flavor<br />The flavor is great because it is not overpowering and not to subtle either.  Since it is a mix, you can add more or less water to get the flavor you desire.  I have tried grape, orange, and lemonade.  Grape is my favorite, although an interesting twist on orange is to add a bit of vanilla creamer - it makes for a tasty Creamsicle flavored treat<br /><br />Zipfizz vs 5-hour energy<br />5-hour energy also has the desired energy boost for me, however, it tends to leave me with cotton mouth.  Zipfizz does not do that since it is mixed with water.  I prefer the added hydration.<br /><br />Lastly, often times I only use half of a canister with 16 oz of water.  This helps maximize the value of the product and for me only half of the canister is plenty of an energy boost.

review/summary: Not All Natural
review/text: This product works but the advertising is misleading. Zipp Fizz claims that it's a natural product and on its website says that it is sweetened with xylitol.  Xylitol is a natural sugar made from the birch tree, and used in Europe for over 100 years.  I use xylitol on a regular basis and agree that if it comes from the right source and not from China, where it's made from corn, it is healthy and has very good side effects such as cavity prevention.  But,on the ingredients list, xylitol is the last ingredient, meaning, that it is the smallest ingredient in the formula.  On the other hand Sucralose (also known as Splenda) is very high on the list of ingredients.  That's where the aftertaste is from.  If you don't care what you put in your body then this is a good product as it does work as advertised.  Why add Splenda if the xylitol is in there? Because the splenda is cheaper. So obviously there is no need for the xylitol other than to use it as a marketing ploy.  They know this and have told me that their new product - immune fizz - has no Splenda.  Why not take it out of the regular zipp fizz too and make it healthier too?  I was sucked into the purchase by the xylitol reference only to find the sucralose in the product.  I wonder what else they aren't saying?

I would suggest that first time drinkers go with the Pink Lemonade, Berry, or Orange Soda.

review/summary: Zipfizz grape-
review/text: I was afraid at firt to try this- I really hate the artificial grape taste of most grape juices and products. This, however, was light- not too sweet. It was a perfect offset to the already existing flavors of Zipfizz- orange, lemon, pink lemonade. (All of which are very tart!)<br />As for energy, this product delivers! I first tried Zipfizz under skepticism, but I was completely and pleasantly surprised that after a thirteen hour work day, I went to the gym right after work that night, and had a nice little burst of energy that lasted as long as I needed it to. There are also no rapid heartbeats, palpitations of the heart or crashes, as the product is made with all natural ingredients. That in itself is a sheer bonus, on top of the fact that there is no sugar or artificial sources of taurine and caffiene.<br />If you despise the taste and the artificial contents of stuff like Red Bull and Rock Star and want an actual energy drink that works as promised, then try Zipfizz, you'll be glad you did.<br />Did I mention it's also packed with vitamins? Those other "energy drinks" can't say that!<br />>>>>>>>

review/summary: first energy drink i've tried
review/text: i have been clean and sober almost 23 yrs. and never got into energy drinks but the local wal mart was giving free samples, small cups so i took one, i felt kind of tired but after drinking just a small cup, felt 'great' body and mind so, i bought a 3 pack. 4.88, they only have grape and i've never liked grape, anything but it was o.k. but kind of expensive for 3 drinks but i figured if that tiny cup made me feel, 'that' good, each tube would last me a while.  i gave 4 stars because in my experience, when it gets too 'hot', the tube,  on two occasions, i put one in my pocket, pulled it out later to pour into a cold bottle of water and even though i poured some of the water out of the bottle, it FIZZED UP AND OUT and made a mess, i think the GOOD STUFF gets lost when this happens, has only happened when it was hot and i did not feel ANYthing after, NO ZIPP, like it all came out.  i am going to try just drinking the amount i drank in the 'sample cup' maybe drinking the whole tube, is too much for me becasue i noticed i get almost wired and that's something i don't want to be, any more, just feel 'good'

review/summary: best alternative for caffiene obsessed people!
review/text: I discovered zipfizz about a year ago working for a local gym. I LOVE IT! I have to wake up VERY early for work and zipfizz gives me that little boost i need. Not to mention the taste---it is amazing :). Pink Lemonade is my personal favorite, but they are all excellent! I stopped drinking energy drinks because of how bad they are for you and I actually began getting sick (headaches, nauseas) everytime I had one. I started drinking zipfizz and feel better than ever. It is also a good alternative to "pre-work out" supplements. Sometimes those supplements give you too much of a high that makes it hard to come down from. I now use zipfizz before working out too :)!

review/summary: My Morning Drink
review/text: I like that Zipfizz isn't full of a bunch of crap.  It gets me out of my morning funk, and makes me start drinking water early.  I mix one tube with 32 oz of water, and have it in place of a morning cup of coffee.  It's not going to give you a ton of energy or get you wired.  It just moves you from tired to awake.  I like that zip fizz is 1/3 the cost of 5 hour energy.  Stay away from the Orange.  It tastes awful.  Grape and Pink Lemonade taste great.

review/summary: Just as good as my morning coffee.
review/text: We got a sample of this stuff at Sam's club and decided to buy a box.<br /><br />=PROS=<br />-Gives me as much of a pick-me-up as my morning coffee. Great for the mid-afternoon slump that a lot of people get.<br />-It tastes great (while it's cold).<br />-Gives you a big dose of B-12.<br /><br />=CONS=<br />-Mix it with cold water and drink it all at once while it's still cold (or drink half and stick the rest in the fridge). The warmer it gets, the more it will taste like the smell inside a bottle of vitamins, which is very disgusting.<br />-It's a bit expensive for what it's intended for and a case of 20 doesn't last long.<br />-If you dump the tube all at once into a bottle of water, it will fizz out all over the place unless you put the cap back on extremely fast. Even if you drink several gulps of water out of the bottle first, it still happens.

review/summary: Grape is my favorite Zipfizz flavor!
review/text: As I am sitting here at work, using company resources and time to write this, I felt compelled to see if there was a multi-pack of zipfizz in the grape flavor only. I've only been able to find zipfizz in the multi-flavor pack with pink lemonade (my least favorite), orange soda (pretty good), and grape (my fave!). I don't drink coffee, and I'm exploring ways to wean myself from the diet soda teat. I love how drinking zipfizz makes me feel like I'm taking my multivitamin. I add to mix by brewing a strong cup of matcha green tea and adding it to the bottle with the zipfizz. Tastes great! It also keeps me from falling asleep at my computer by 2:30pm. :)<br /><br />Bottom line, if I had to choose one energy drink, I would choose zipfizz. If I had to choose one flavor, it would most definitely be grape. Love it!

review/summary: Pleasant tasting with a nice energy buzz.
review/text: As someone who doesn't get nearly enough sleep, I am always looking for an effective and tasty caffeine boost. Problem is, I don't like the taste of coffee, and soda has high calories-to-caffeine ratio. Energy drinks typically have a chemical taste that doesn't sit well with me. The Zipfizz Grape Energy Drink Mix provides an excellent boost of energy, yet tastes pretty good. I get as much energy from one tube than I would from a cup of coffee or Red Bull. If you've had a five-hour energy shot you'll understand the type of boost you get from a Zipfizz. It has no calories from sugar, and is low carb, plus since you are mixing it with water you stay pretty hydrated. One caveat: do not drink one of these in the evening unless you plan on staying up really late; I drank one at about 6pm and was up past 3am. Thankfully, I didn't feel jittery or irritable, just WIDE awake. Also, other reviews have mentioned that this keeps you regular, and yes it does indeed.

review/summary: does what it says, decent taste
review/text: I drink zip fizz mostly while biking.  With all these products the question of taste is critical and personal.  The product has a decent artificial grape taste- similar to grape soda.  IMPORTANT FACT:  It is much better when ice cold.  Be sure to mix it with ice or freezing cold water- all zip fizz products taste better cold than at room temperature.

review/summary: Great Then NOT
review/text: I first started using Zipfizz about 2-3 years ago and enjoyed during that time period HOWEVER, I don't know if they changed something in the formula or what but now I cannot drink it without side effects. It use to give me the extra kick and energy I needed... through the morning... another through the afternoon. RECENTLY though when I drink just a small amount I get 'VERTIGO' which will last for a few days, actually causing me to miss 2 days of work. I fell ok when I am sitting or lying down, but when I stand I am dizzy and it lasts for days. Also, the muscles in the back and on the side of my neck ache, directly behind and below the back of my ears. This is still an after effect that has lasted since I first experienced this. After initially having the dizziness effect, a month later I wanted to put my theory to the test so I bought another box from my local Costco and took just a few drinks and AGAIN the same effects occurred causing me miss work. NOW I HAVE NEW INFORMATION - My 24 yr old son ( who occasionally would use Zipfizz ) has reported the same effect with his latest use of the product. This leads me to believe they have changed something... or there was ONE HUGE BAD BATCH of the stuff made somewhere. Draw your own conclusions, just my experience. Thanks, Don

This product works; I learned the hard way never to take it after 5pm. I couldn't get to sleep until 2am despite how tired I was. The citrus taste reminds of grapefruit juice, of which I am not a fan. It tastes pretty good when added to cranberry fruit juice (instead of water). For my next purchase I will choose a different flavor.

review/summary: A good energy product needing a bit of caution
review/text: I tried this product at a local store and went back for 2 boxes because it is non-caffeine and non-sugar.  As a diabetic and someone who suffers from reflux, this is great.  And the $1 or so each is so much better than the $3 for those 5 hour drinks.<br /><br />A bit of common sense caution however; do NOT drink one close to the end of a work day no matter how much you need a pick me up.  I did that once, just once (never again) and I had difficulty sleeping.<br /><br />Second, if you are going to dump it into a bottle of water, drink about a quarter of the water (or pour it out) before adding.  The thing fizzes and can get quite messy.<br /><br />Third, do not take if you've an upset stomach or feeling nauseous as it can make one gassy.<br /><br />Otherwise, as I said, money wise, health wise, this $1 a pop, no sugar, no caffeine is great!

review/summary: Grape flavor is horrible; no energy boost at all
review/text: I've been drinking 2 energy drinks every morning. (2 for $5 at local convenience store.) I wanted to try something that would be a little cheaper so I bought a case of Grape Flavored ZipFizz.<br /><br />I chose grape because I drink bottled water flavor packets all the time and love the taste. However, the grape flavor of ZipFizz is just awful - its got to be the worst tasting thing I've ever drank. I can get used to the flavor after a while, I'm sure.<br /><br />I'm drinking my second bottle of this stuff today. (84,000% recommended daily amount of B12 anyone?) I don't feel any energy effects what so ever. No jitters, no boost of energy, nothing. Maybe they should scale back on the B12 and focus a little more on energy and taste?<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but this stuff hasn't worked for me. I doubt I'll finish the entire case, I'm having problems just finishing this second bottle. It's a shame too since I really enjoy energy drinks overall. Having a powered form that I can toss into my bottle waters would have been very convenient for me.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars because I'm generous.

review/summary: Almost, but not quite
review/text: There was this one energy drink I had been buying from Wal-mart.  It was the only place I could find it.  Then one day, it was pulled from the shelf in every single Wal-mart within an hours drive.  And that's a lot of Wal-marts!  This energry drink was quite possibly the best I had ever and will ever taste.  I could get a 10-pack for $1.50.  That price just couldn't be beat and it tasted great too.  The only place you can get it now is from a somewhat shady looking website that sells 10-packs for like $15.  So there I was energy drink-less.  I started looking online for alternatives and I came across Zipfizz.  I figured I'd check some local stores for small packs to sample and give it a try.<br /><br />I purchased this product as somewhat of a "blind buy."  I had tried the orange, citrus, and pink lemonade by purchasing small three packs at some of the local stores.  However, I wanted to try the grape and the berry.  The only way I was going to be able to do that was to buy them online.  So I went for the berry.  About the best I can say is it's not horrible.  Just like the others I had tried, it had a very strong B-vitamin taste to it.  It was very overpowering in this flavor.  Having tried those other flavors, I would have to say this is probably my least favorite.  As for the rest, the orange is definitely top notch.  There's hardly any B-vitamin taste to it as it is masked by the orange flavor.  The orange sort of reminds me more of orange popsicles or an orange flavored drink than it does of an actual orange.  But it's still pretty good.  The same can be said for citrus, it covers the B-vitamin flavor well.  It has a similar taste to the orange, but it tasted like there was some lemon and lime mixed in there.  It was pretty good.  The pink lemonade is pretty good, if you can get past the fact that it's a fizzy drink.  And that's exactly what it tasted like, a fizzy pink lemonade.  It just had a minor B-vitamin after taste to it.  I haven't yet tried the grape, but would still like to.  After my experience with the berry though, I'm not hopeful.  Orange is good enough for me for now and I've actually found it cheaper locally in the big 20-pack.

review/summary: Worth the messy hands!
review/text: I had this at a Christmas party and the host said they serve it every year because people love it so much. I just made it and my guests loved it.  Must serve it with a high-quality french or sourdough bread for dipping in the sauce. Don't serve with a wimpy bread that will disintegrate when you dip it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Louisiana spicy (a "pro" if you like spicy). It's definitely spicy but not off the charts.<br />Ridiculously easy to prepare with this mix.<br />Incredibly delicious - people raved about it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Messy - not good "date food."<br />High calorie if you serve with the recommended bread. If you don't serve with the bread it's probably not that bad because most of the butter remains in the pan.<br />A little challenging to keep it warm without overcooking the shrimp.

review/summary: I love Nutritional Yeast!
review/text: I've been a vegan for almost a year now and I use nutritonal yeast a lot. I use it to make vegan queso for my nachos, mac & cheese, sprinkled on my popcorn and I like to make a vegan version of parmesan using cashews and nutritonal yeast. I use it in a ton of recipes. MANY people love nutritonal yeast but you will either love it or hate it. You really just need to get a few recipes and try them.

review/summary: What parmesan cheese?
review/text: One of my biggest challenge when going vegan was leaving Parmesan cheese behind.  As I read more and more books I realized that many recipes called for the very versatile Nutritional Yeast.  Happyherbivore.com had a good blog post about it and my first use after receiving this product was to top pasta with it.  Delicious and I have been using it so often- in so many different recipes - that I am going to have to order another bag.

review/summary: Can't abide the taste.
review/text: I am a young adult just starting to try to convert to Veganism and read many good reviews of this particular brand of nutritional yeast claiming it was the tastiest of the bunch.  It is included in many Vegan recipes as a substitute taste-wise for cheese - and after tasting it myself I can't imagine the people who created the recipes have ever tasted any kind of cheese - even bad cheese - because this tastes like sawdust and stale mini wheats.  I can only imagine it being useful as a possible thickening agent for sauces and the like.  I'm sure the company is totally respectable and the product is probably a fine choice, but nutritional yeast was not, I found, all it was touted to be.

review/summary: Tastey- doesn't replace cheese.
review/text: We have used yeast flakes for about a year now and my kids enjoy the taste, great on top of burritos or on broccoli . DO NOT BUY THIS THINKING THEY CAN REPLACE CHEESE. I can't even imagine how nasty it would be to try to make this into a mac and cheese mixture or something. It is what it is, don't try to make it into something it's not.

review/text: Compare to Hamburger Helper, but better, without the gluten.  This company makes several other varieties; tuna, chicken, stroganoff.  All are good, quick, & easy.

review/summary: Makes a decent quick dinner
review/text: My family liked this.  The only other Mrs. Leeper's boxed meal we tried was the Cheeseburger Mac and that was like eating a box of salt.  We were pleasantly surprised that the Beef Lasagna meal was quite tasty and not overly salty.  The corn pasta was good (we usually have brown rice pasta) and the tomato sauce had a nice flavor.  I would serve this again on a night we need a quick dinner.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I have been gluten free for over 2 years. I have had the attitude, "If I can't eat it I'm not cooking it", since that time. This is the first time I have tried a gluten free box mix. I made the lasagna (with turkey) and added a bit of mozzarella and parm cheese on top and it is gone!! I can't remember what hamburger helper tasted like, but this was good! I was shocked at how much the family liked it... time to try the rest!!

review/summary: LOVE Mrs. Leepers!
review/text: Mrs. Leepers dinners are a favorite at our house.  My two boys (who have celiac disease) just gobble it up.  It's great with both hamburger or ground turkey.  You really don't have to add anything since the flavor is so good, but sometimes I saute and add diced garlic and onion.  We never have leftovers when Mrs. Leepers is for dinner!

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: This is a tasty G.F. product. I've been on a G.F. diet for 7 years so have tried a lot of different products and this is one I reorder. My only negative would be that it doesn't reheat well, but that's true of most G.F. pastas. Not a problem if more than one person is eating it. Nice to have some thing quick and easy to make that is still a hot meal and G.F.

review/summary: Soy Great for Menopause!
review/text: Being a woman going through menopause, it's a hard road to travel. Everyone is different, so do and some don't have symptons. For me, the emotional roller coaster is the worst. I had been put on 1 mg. of a hormone supplement,but that just didn't do much. I put myself on lots of vitamins and they did help some. It was not until I discovered I could not drink regular milk (carraganan problem), that I tried soy milk. Well, "Silk" also has the ingredient that I can not tolerate...so..I went to the health food store and found this wonder soy milk!! No only is does it taste wonderful (who doesn't like chocolate), but it help alot with my menopause. I did some research and found out Soy is great to help treat the symptons...of course my doc. did not tell me this!! Anyway, I am not a tri-monthly customer of Amazon and I get a 12 carton case every three months..I am so glad Amazon has it..I also save 2.00 per carton and get FREE SHIPPING!!Now that a great deal!!

review/summary: Great Product, Bad Shipping
review/text: I love this product...have been using it for years. It is impossible to find in stores anymore, so I was thrilled to find it online at amazon.com. I have a standing order for it. BUT--only about half of the orders come through intact. Sometimes they arrive to us leaking through the box...sometimes UPS returns it on our behalf before it even gets to us. I have notified amazon about this problem, but I just found out today that UPS returned the latest shipment. This is ridiculous.
