review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised!
review/text: I was skeptical about purchasing a coffee specifically formulated for making iced coffee. I mean, I spent all last summer making iced coffee from extra bold k cups and they were very good. So, what's the big deal? I'll tell you, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I didn't realize it before, but the flavors of doing it my old way were not quite as rich and complex as these Nantucket blend iced coffee k cup. Plus, when I was brewing it my old way on the iced coffee setting and barely getting a cup full. With the iced coffee k cups, I brew it on the 6 oz setting, and get a nice big full cup of iced coffee with just enough room to add a little 1/2 and 1/2. Sir in a generous spoon of sugar and you get an iced coffee better than the donut and coffee shops for a mere fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Try these; you'll love 'em. Oh, and it might be worth noting, for those of you who feel the same way and were wondering, I do not particularly like the regular Nantucket K cups for hot coffee.

review/text: Saw this at Kohl's and thought, what the heck. I'll try it. Got it home and it was great. Filled up a to go coffee mug with ice (dont want to use glass as it may crack with the hot vs cold) , and then brew it over the ice. Then add more ice after (most melts while brewing), then add my own Vanilla, French Vanilla, or Vanilla Nut liquid creamer, stir it up and transfer it all to a tall glass then put it in the freezer for a bit to give it that icy feeling.<br />YUMMMM!! Im hooked for sure. A bit expensive but worth it and cheaper than Starbucks or even McDonalds.<br /><br />You wont be disappointed so give it a try

review/summary: My Favorite K-cup!
review/text: I really enjoy iced coffee drinks.  I can make an iced drink with a regular coffee K-cup, but I'd much rather make it with the Green Mountain Nantucket Iced K-cup.  I just love the flavor that it has.  I tried the French Vanilla Iced Coffee K-cup, and I thought I'd like it since I love vanilla.  But yuck!  I did not care for that one at all.  My favorite way to prepare the Nantucket Iced Coffee is to brew a 6 ounce size about a half an hour before I leave for work, without ice.  I mix in about 2-3 tsp. sugar, and a few drops of vanilla extract, or the vanilla from Trader Joes that does not have alcohol in it.  I let it cool in the frig for about 20-30 minutes, then I pour it over a 16 oz. size insulated cup full of ice, leaving about an extra inch on top in order to pour on some organic half and half.  The coffee will still be warm when you pour it over the ice, but it will melt the ice just the right amount, but not too much.  Nummy!

I add my sugar and creamer afterwards and the taste is really weak and diluted.  The flavor is hardly there.  I'm really surprised by the good reviews this coffee has been getting.

review/summary: Good Flavor! Horrible Design!
review/text: We were so excited to get these K-cups when they first came out. We got 1 iced coffee out of about 5 k-cups. For some reason, the glue that holds down the tin foil on the top of the pod does not stay glued during the brewing process and coffee grounds come spilling out into the Keurig and the coffee below every time. We ordered another box thinking it was just a bad batch and they also do the same thing. Its a bummer that these k-cups can't be made better. The one cup of iced coffee that we dd get turned out to be very good!<br /><br />We won't be using these in our Keurig anymore. It is a huge pain to clean up the mess it makes every time we try to brew one. We have tried over 10 different brands of k-cups (teas, hot chocolates, variety coffees, etc...) and have not had a single issue with any other k-cups.

review/text: I love iced coffee!  When I got my Keurig I tried a variety of different K-Cups trying to find the perfect iced coffee.  And, I was disappointed time after time...until I tried the Nantucket Blend Iced coffee.  I fill a cup half way with ice about 4-5 cubes and brew the coffee on the medium setting (I think it's 7.25).  I then add splenda and a little creamer and then some more ice cubes after.  I realized if you completely fill the cup with ice cubes and then brew over it, they all melt and totally dilute the coffee.  So, I fill half way and then add a couple more cubes at the end.

Keep your ice maker full of fresh ice and select the next lower setting on your brewer to not dilute the blend .

review/text: I love these iced K cups... Have been ordering for over a year. My machine is a Cuisinart, not Keurig and has a 4 oz setting that DOES NOT heat the coffee so I never have to let it sit in the freezer as others suggest. Highly recommended coffee; I let the KCUP run a second time into an empty cup and put the leftover liquids into an ice tray and use the next day for the coffee so it's not diluted when the "ice" melts.. Recommend everyone to do it as well !

review/text: I love drinking iced coffee when it's warmer out and since my local grocery store does not sell iced coffee k-cups, I found these online instead.  The only problem with making iced coffee in a keurig is that it melts all the ice.  I usually make mine in a mug without ice and put the mug in the freezer while I get ready in the morning.  About 20 minutes later I pour the coffee from the mug, into my insulated cup with lip, add ice and milk and go on my way.  This is a stronger coffee, more of a medium-dark roast.

review/text: This was my first try of iced-coffee on the Keurig and I was pleasantly surprised.  I usually prepare this beverage in a Tervis Tumbler over ice; however, when I do think ahead, I will make it without ice and put the cup in the freezer overnight to make a stronger cup of coffee that does not become diluted with water.  This particular flavor from Green Mountain has a medium flavor that has very little bitterness.  It is a great coffee for a beginner drinker and I my lone critique is that it was stronger as I like a bolder flavor.

review/summary: Makes a good iced coffee
review/text: For whatever reason I've always had trouble making a good iced coffee, even if I chill it first in the fridge before adding ice.  Maybe it is the coffee.<br /><br />This takes all the guesswork out of it.  I just use a pint glass like you'd use for beer... pack it with ice, and brew the 6 oz size.  I usually add a couple ice cubes after, and then take a big drink to make room for the creme and sugar.  Couldn't be easier and tastes like you'd expect iced coffee to taste like... you know, the kind of thing you'd pay a few bucks for at the trendy coffee spot on the corner.<br /><br />The only downside is the price, compared to standard k-cups.  I know the k-cups contain more coffee, but honestly, I don't think that is a significant extra expense for the manufacturer.  As usual with k-cups, they are insanely cheaper than going to the corner spot to get your coffee, but noticeably more expensive than brewing ground coffee... in this case a bit more expensive that usual.

They are also all shaped somewhat differently roundish, which gives them a unique - homemade - look. The color is a bit off-white as well, with some dark chunks (small, but not specks) in them, which adds to the unique appearance. These are not made with artificial sweeteners, yet the calorie/carb content is very low. The mint flavor is interesting, because I found it got MORE intense as kept on sucking, not less so as others do. Great product, and much cheaper here than where I bought mine. Cool!

review/summary: great food!
review/text: My kitty eats all the flavors of Natural Balance Platefulls on rotation, and loves all of them equally. He gets dry food in the morning, and a pouch for dinner every night. His coat is GORGEOUSLY soft and shiny, and these pouches don't give him nasty gas or rowdy bad breath like some other canned/pouch foods. When I first opened a pouch, I saw that it had peas and carrots in it, and I figured those would be left behind in the bowl. Cats just...don't eat vegetables. To my surprise, the bowl was licked clean! And after 3 months, he still licks the bowl clean every night!

review/summary: Very aromatic and flavorful
review/text: To be honest, I bought this rosemary because its price was less than I'd pay for 1/10 the amount from other companies, and I thought I'd just use extra if it wasn't really fresh.  What a pleasant surprise I've gotten!  I keep what I need for a short while in a spice jar, and store the rest in an air-tight bag in the freezer, where it keeps perfectly.  I'm not sure what makes this so much less expensive than other brands (less packaging? bulk quantity?), but I'm really glad I tried it!

review/summary: Always Amazing Frontier Spices: Rosemary Leaf is Wonderful!
review/text: I've been buying Frontier's herbs and spices in bulk on Amazon.com for years and well, they are consistently high quality and very good products.  The freshness cannot be beat for a dried, bulk herb.  Frontier's Rosemary Leaf is exceptionally good compared to store-bought tiny containers of old Rosemary Leaf that costs a LOT more than this Frontier product.  Buy in bulk, put it in air-tight containers and save a LOT of money!  I can't be more positive or recommend more highly this Frontier product!

review/summary: A good Ceylon tea need not be an oxymoron
review/text: Pro:  While it has that classic"Ceylon" taste, it's not as bright as, say Lipton Ceylon tea is. It's also has a  modest floral hint, and isn't very tannic, which I like. It's a bit light for the customary milk and sugar, but if that's the way you like it, this tea will work, if you aren't looking for the "hit me with a 2x4"-esque strong cuppa (like traditional English Breakfast). It's good without the usual accoutrements, too.<br /><br />Anti: it's not whole leaf. Also, it seems to have quite a high caffeine content, but that might be a vagary of the batch I got (a quick washout with hot water helps remove much of the alkaloid  without significantly impairing the taste).<br /><br />Summary: better than a tea bag. Not stellar, though. If you like a middle-of-the-road robust black tea, this is a worthwhile purchase, and will serve you well as a daily drinker without breaking the bank (methinks it's cheaper to drink liquid gold than some of the "premium" teas out there).

review/summary: Udawatte Tea-Dilmah
review/text: As a boy who grew up in Sri Lankaon on my Father's tea plantation and having first hand knowledge of tea, as also worked on tea plantations. This tea has a fine flavor and does seem to come from the higher elevations of Sri Lanka, which historically have produced the best flavored teas of the World. The Dilmah tea that I enjoyed the most was a Dilmah Gold Leaf loose black tea that I was able to purchase earlier, but do not seem to be able to find any longer on the market. Maybe Merrill who is a peer of mine can put this to right. If you appreciate a fine flavored Ceylon Tea you cannot go wrong with the Dilmah Udawatte Tea.<br />Ajith

review/summary: My dog loves this stuff & his coat is super shiny!
review/text: I buy this dog food from a local store as it is a bit cheaper, but I wanted to review on here for anyone interested. My dog loves chicken but turned up his nose at other chicken meal dog foods before this one. Before Avoderm, he would graze at his food and only eat when he was really hungry. Now with Avoderm, he eats all of his food right away, right as I put it in his bowl.<br /><br />Not only does he seem to love it, it has really done wonders for his coat. His hair is sleek, shiny, and smooth. He has less dander as well.<br /><br />I can feel good about giving him Avoderm because it is an all natural product. They even have grain-free options if your pup is allergic to grain. And it is easy to find this item in the big box pet stores. Highly recommend, your pup will thank you!

The merchant doesn't seem to know the difference between the two products.<br /><br />It took them eight days to respond to my order and ship it, so that is a little slower than some merchants I've done business with through Amazon.<br /><br />Although chocolate covered nibs are great for snacking on, I am very disappointed to have waited longer than I had hoped only to get the wrong item.

review/summary: Not quite the same item
review/text: I checked the vendor's website (Taylor's Market), and they only picture the item the same as it is shown here. But that isn't what they sent me - "55% Dark Organic Chocolate Covered Cacao Nibs". No mention of dark chocolate covered on Amazon or Taylor's.<br /><br />It's hard to judge the quality of something you've never seen before, but here goes. They seem well made. Deep cocoa aroma in the can. First taste is the dark chocolate, which melts away to the nibs. They are little chunks of roasted cacao bean. The beans are crunchy, a bit bitter and sort of mealy, not smooth. I don't think I'll buy any more, but I got them for our "dark chocolate tasting club" and the adventure of something out of the ordinary. So I'm satisfied with what I got, but the product is not quite as detailed.<br /><br />Ingredients: Dark chocolate (cacao beans, cane sugar, cocoa butter, whole vanilla bean), roasted cacao nibs. All ingredients certified organic. May contain traces of nuts.

review/summary: May site in warehouse for weeks
review/text: I have purchased directly from the Coffee Bean Direct website many times with great success.  While ordering a few items from Amazon I noticed that they also sold here and my order was eligible for Super Saver Shipping, so I added a bag to my order.  When ordering direct from CBD the order arrives with strong aroma before you even open the package and the roast date is literally only days ago.  The bag I ordered through Amazon arrived in the same box as my other items and that made me wonder, as I expected it to arrive directly from New Jersey and CBD.  The bag didn't have the strong aroma and I noted the Julian date code on the bottom of the bag and it was 43 days ago.  I think the product description is a bit deceiving as it is the same as on their website.  The beans maybe roasted with 24hrs of packaging, but take into account they must send bulk amounts to the Amazon hubs and these may site for weeks or months before being shipped to customers.  Still good coffee, but nothing compared to buying directly from them.

review/text: This is a fantastic product. I love ginger tea but tea bags don't do it for me. This is a granulated product that you pour out of the sachet and then add hot water. The result is the FULL flavor of ginger - hot, hot, hot!! There are two versions, one with and the other without sugar so be sure about which one you're buying

review/summary: Sooooooo Much Better & Stronger Than The Tea Bags!!!!!!
review/text: Ginger Tea is my favorite to drink, especially when I have an upset stomach.  Usually I would cut up the ginger root and boil in hot water.  Then I tried the tea bags.  But I would need to use 2 or 3 bags to actually get the full effect.  I purchased this instant ginger in Jamaica & the clerk explained to me the difference between this and the tea bags.  I'm so glad I decided to try it b/c I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! It's so strong and it works when I need it!  My only issue is that I didn't buy more than 1 box!

review/summary: Biobags are a joke.  A sick joke.
review/text: Biobags are the worst trash bags ever created.  They are so weak that they hold only about one third the weight of even a cheap conventional bag, thus requiring you to use about three times as many bags, and each bag costs four times what the cheap non-biodegradable bag costs!  No one would buy these ridiculous things if they weren't forced to do so by their local government.

review/summary: The best of the energy chews!
review/text: I'm a runner doing 30-50 miles a week and am currently (9/10) training for the Chicago Marathon.  I've tried all of the gels and chews that are out there and these are my favorite.  I don't like gels as that squirt of mush activates my gag reflex.  Plus you always need water with them.  I've tried all of the other brands of energy chews (I think); Sharkies (good but sticky and not very tasty), Clif Shot Bloks (nice package, very sticky on the fingers), GU Chomps (super sticky and caused some nausea), PowerBar Gel Blasts (very good but tough to chew if cold).  The Honey Stinger chews are very easy to chew and you don't need water.  They don't stick to your teeth either.  The main selling point for me is that they taste good and don't cause nausea no matter what.  I'm sticking with these ones.

Good consistent and natural energy and electrolytes.  No stomach upset, which I always got w/ Gu.

review/summary: Best Thing On The Trail
review/text: I hate to just echo everyone else, but these things<br />really ARE that good. Like a lot of folks, I hadn't<br />heard of these before Backpacker Magazine<br />raved about them in April of '09.<br />I gave 'em a try and was blown away.<br /><br />Over the years I've found that I find food<br />--on long hikes--less and less appetizing...<br />especially when the temperature is over 90.<br />The thought of chewing and swallowing is<br />not appealing.<br /><br />Obviously SOME nourishment is still necessary,<br />but I came to dread PowerBars, and then next, the<br />tastier bars they spawned. So I switched to gels,<br />but after awhile, I came to dread those, as well.<br />But these little chews are delicious--I'll eat them<br />even when nothing else sounds good.<br />Between hikes, I keep them out of sight, because<br />otherwise I'd snack on them at home.<br />I'm on here now ordering another dozen for a big hike.

I gave some to a 7yr old and she loved it!

review/text: They have a great fruity flavor.  They are pretty sweet but you can taste the honey in them and the sweetness doesnt overpower the fruit flavor.  The texture is perfect, not too gummy like gummy bears that you have to chew forever but also not stick-to-your-teeth like sharkies. Kinda like gum drops and there's lots of them in a bag so you dont feel like you got cheated.  I think I like these more than any other sports chews I have tried.  They also dont leave your fingers sticky after handling them.  I hope they come out with new flavors.

review/summary: Great, but special?  I'm not so sure.
review/text: These Honey Stingers are great.  I've used them a handful of times on runs lasting over an hour.  They do seem to provide some much-needed energy.  They're easy to chew, taste great, don't stick in my teeth or make me extra thirsty, and the packet is small enough to be portable.  I really like that the ingredients are pronounceable and healthy enough (organic tapioca, cane sugar, fruit juice, etc.).<br /><br />However, I don't see how they're any different from organic fruit snacks (like Annie's bunnies), which I can get much cheaper in a multi-pack from my local wholesale club.  The ingredients and nutrition information are virtually identical.  For that reason, I gave them just 4 stars.

review/summary: Good substitute for candy but Sharkies are healthier
review/text: These are a good alternative to candy, but still a lot of sugar in a better form.<br />Sharkies energy sports chews are not quite so sweet BUT are Healthier becasue the man ingredient is brown rice syrup which is a complex carbohydrate with low glycemic index. Being very hypogylcemic brown rice syrup and agave nectar are the only two natural sweetners that don't cause a "sugar crash". So for this reason the stingers only get 3 stars and sharkies get 5! If you want sweeter in sharkies get the kids version, but they are like stingers- no brown rice syrup. Oh, the brown rice version fill me up faster because they are a complex carbohydrate and don't cause blood sugar fluctuations.

review/summary: Skip this if you don't want to Bonk!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Stinger products. However, these little gummy gels do nothing as compared to the Stinger Honey Packs. If you are a road or mountain biker and need a good burst of quick energy to keep from bonking on that last hill, these will not help. In fact, the only benefit that I (or any of my riding buddies) have found is that they make your mouth water. Conceivably, this could help with water consumption when riding through the desert (Moab, Fruita). It is my guess that these are not intended for exercising. Maybe, people just use them at work to keep from eating Starburst or something less healthy?!

review/text: I'm training for my first marathon in November 2011 and these chews have kept me going during my long 18 to 20 mile training runs.  I dissolve them in water rather than carry them as chews and sip steadily after mile 8.  They taste like concentrated hawaiian punch and do not upset my stomach whatsoever.  I also eat them prior to a workout if I am feeling low energy and will even snack on them in lieu of candy.  Seriously, they are that good.  I have tried GU as well as Powerbar gels and both do the trick but are nowhere near as tasty.  The consistency of the chews are slightly softer than DOTs candy.

review/summary: Great tasting with help keeping energy up.
review/text: I was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running.  I am 60 years old and about 50 pounds overweight.  I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still, everything is organic which I suppose should add to it's value.  I found that I felt no energy boost during my activities but I can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going.  It's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going.  I don't like feeling like I'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that.  I think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising.  The only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them.  I will purchase again when my grocery money allows.  I would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy pickup to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost.
