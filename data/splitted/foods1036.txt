review/summary: Good texture and healthier than regular noodles
review/text: I remember the day when I tried a whole wheat noodle for the first time (years ago).  The kids were not impressed with the texture or taste (kind of like cardboard). Since then we have tried many "healthier noodles".  I think this one is the winner.  I like the fact it is made with organic whole grains and flax.  The texture is good and the taste doesn't overpower or alter anything I put with it.  It also freezes well when cooked al dente.  When you thaw and reheat it they won't end up like mush (like other noodles do).

review/summary: Hearty and Healthier
review/text: We've been using this for a while now (a few years) and the whole family quite enjoys it. My preschooler eats it without question. I've found the taste of the pasta (which does have a discernible nuttiness) is too overpowering for some of the more delicate pasta sauces (garlic aoli, a la vodka, etc.), but works perfectly in heartier fare, like Bolognese. It's our go-to pasta choice.

review/summary: Good, toothy texture
review/text: I had concerns about ordering this, especially since it's a multi-pack. I always buy whole grain pasta, but I've tried brands that have a mealy texture. I like this. Be aware that it's not the same texture as white pasta, though. If you prefer soft breads to hearty, grainy ones, this might not be for you. There are other brands that maintain the texture and flavor of "regular" pasta but have added fiber (look in your local grocery store). If in doubt, look for this brand in the natural foods and try it before getting a multi-pack.

review/summary: Best Instant Hot Chocolate Ever
review/text: The winter here in Afghanistan has been colder than anyone can remember and it has snowed here more than it has ever snowed in the last 10 years.  One thing that helps keep my bones toasty is this fine quality hot chocolate.  I first got turned on to this brand when I took a free sample from a care package at the local Red Cross on post.  From the first cup I was hooked.  This is the best tasting instant hot cocoa I ever had...ever!  After this, I can no longer go back to the less expensive products.  Every sip of this cocoa is like being on top of mount Everest with the cold brisk wind flowing through your hair but at the same time a warm fuzzy sensation is circulating throughout your body keeping you warm from the hard mountain top conditions.  Yes!  It's that good!  Try it for yourself.

review/text: Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour.  That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.<br />They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item.

review/text: I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like "Pop Tarts" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item.

review/text: I tried these, even though I haven't had a toaster "pastry" since I was a kid (and didn't much care for them then, either).  For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle.  However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again.  They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of "frosting" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much "sweet cardboard".  Just not really worth eating, in my opinion.  A piece of toast with jam is more appealing.

They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors.<br /><br />This doesn't make them completely "healthy" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome.

review/summary: A tasty, kosher, healthier alternative to Pop Tarts
review/text: First and foremost, these toaster pastries taste great! You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy.

review/text: I never thought I would see the day!!!! This is an amazing product. Another excellent healthy junk food replacement, and they taste wonderful. To me the traditional Pop Tart taste like cardboard, these you can actually taste flavor. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND.

review/summary: Guiltless Tarts
review/text: These Frosted Wildberry Acai Toaster Pastries are very tasty.  They have a strong berry flavor and a delicate crust that is slightly cruncy.<br /><br />The pinky-purple frosting is a hit with the kids.  They call them "Purple Flurp" tarts.  (From Jimmy Neutron on Nikelodeon)  And they like them!<br /><br />Real fruit, whole grains, no high fructose corn syrup and reasonably priced.  Guilt free treats for my kids (mom and dad too).

review/summary: Just Tried The Cherry Pomegranate
review/text: I've tried the Apple, Strawberry, and now the Cherry Pomegranate.  All of them are pretty good. The Cherry Pomegranate doesn't taste that much different than the strawberry.  It might have more of a berry flavor to it.  Compared to a pop tart they're not as flavorful, but they're a step in the healthy direction.  They've got enough sweet to get the job done. Make sure whichever one you buy, that you get the frosted and not the plain.  The plain is too dull without the frosting complimenting it. The only fruit flavor left for me to try now is the blueberry.

review/text: Although my kids prefer Pop Tarts, this is a healthy alternative. Believe it or not, the Apple without the frosting is pretty decent. There is cinnamon on the top of it which adds a bit of spice...I don't really like too much frosting on mine. The cherry pomengrante is the most preferred in my home. They don't last as long as opposed to the blueberry...Strawberry is delicious too. They travel pretty well too. Don't crumble too much...

review/text: I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted. I would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it. The frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness. One package w/ coffee is a perfect quick breakfast. Since AMZ is now out of stock for this flavor, I ordered the apple frosted ones.I think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me.

review/text: I went out and bought the frosted Strawberry.  I must say I really like them.  The first time I tried this product was in the Apple Cinnamon flavor that was not frosted.  Like some of the other posters have stated, go for the frosted.  The plain ones are ok, but the frosted ones hits the spot.<br /><br />For me it is hard to decide which is better, the Strawberry or the Apple Cinnamon.  I haven't tried the Blueberry yet, but I'm tempted to see how it tastes.

review/text: Two out of my three boys love these toaster pastries.  They are pretty healthy for them and are a great snack to throw in my bag when we are on the go.  My only suggestion would be to wrap them individually, because I only let them have one at a time, which is plenty.  Or, to eliminate unnecessary packaging, pack them without the individual wrappers in the box.

review/text: The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.<br /><br />Nature's Path Organic Apple Cinnamon Toaster Pastries do taste "slightly" healthy, but they remind me of some nutmeg cookies I make that are also made with whole-wheat flour.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic apple cinnamon filling (organic evaporated cane juice, organic apple juice concentrate, water, organic evaporated apples, vegetable glycerin, organic apple powder, organic corn startch, organic cinnamon, locust bean gum), organic whole-wheat flour, organic white flour, water, organic evaporated cane juice, organic palm oil, powdered organic eveaporated cane juice, organic invert syrup, salt, leavening, natural flavor, agar, tocopherols (for freshness).<br /><br />Unfortunately these do contain palm oil, although I don't seem to be as allergic to organic palm oil. Makes me wonder what I'm really allergic to, as in what is in the additional element in the non-organic Palm Kernel Oil. Could it simply be that this is the non-hydrogenated version. Could be.<br /><br />Each pastry is 190 Calories<br /><br />40 Calories from Fat<br /><br />They heat up fast in the toaster and are convenient for a snack.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: BEST TOASTER PASTRY
review/text: These are the very best of any organic or non-organic toaster pastry we have ever tried.  Cherry Pomegran is the favorite flavor in our house.  It has a real fruit taste and a real pastry taste, not like regular brand & store brands that have always left me with indigestion and a lingering unpleasant taste.  Plus they have healthier ingredients than regular brands so I can feel good about giving these one or two times a week for really quick breakfasts or on the go breakfast when necessary.  We have embraced organic foods since the mid 1990's and these are among the best.  Amazon offers a better deal  than the ones we got at retail store.  By the way, strawberry frosted is our family's second favorite flavor.  Recommend trying them.  Five stars for sure.

review/text: Every one of my children love these toaster pastries...which is hard to accomplish in this house!  I had originally purchased them from our local health food store($3.89/box) because my pickiest eater begged for them.  Obviously, I'm not going to continuously pay that much for a box of 6 toaster pastries.  So, I went on the hunt for the best price.  I purchased these through Subscribe & Save on Amazon and I get them for $2.29/box with free shipping.  That means I don't even have to go TO the store.  What a deal!  We're going to try the Wildberry Acai next...I'll let you know what we think of those!

review/text: These are a great alternative to PopTarts. I've only tried the strawberry. Crust, icing, filling - all are delicious. My only change would be to make the filling thicker. The outer edges of the crust can be a little dry without a bit of the filling to go with it so I find myself breaking off the outside edges to get to the yummy middle. Maybe I'm just picky. But otherwise, I love them!

review/summary: A Sinful Treat... With A Little Less Sin
review/text: Okay, in the grand scheme of things, if you're closely watching your calorie intake... these aren't for you. Yes, they are organic! LOVE that they are organic! But they have similar stats to their non-organic counterpart (one of these toaster pastries has 210 calories and 5g fat while the other non-organic brand's toaster pastries average the same - 210 calories and 5g fat). However, it's nice to see that the first ingredient in Nature's Path Frosted Raspberry toaster pastries is Organic Wheat Flour, while the other brand's first ingredient is enriched flour). At any rate, I picked up two different flavors of Nature's Path toaster pastries from my local Whole Foods and I haven't been able to stop eating them since. I bought the Wildberry Acai on Amazon without having tried them first, since I had yet to be disappointed by a flavor of theirs to date. While they are not my favorite flavor (the iced Raspberry and Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are beyond amazing), they definitely leave my tastebuds satisfied. I wouldn't say these are guilt-free, but I do feel less guilty knowing that they are organic!

review/summary: Not health food, but far, far better than Pop-Tarts
review/text: Making the change from a typical American diet to a healthier organic and more whole-grain centered diet is no mean feat with my 6-year-old.  I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.  I refuse to buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it so, needless to say, Pop-Tarts are not known in my house.  When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.  What a concept.<br /><br />I also want to note that purchasing them through subscribe and save is a considerable savings over buying them in the grocery store.  When all is said and done, I'll have paid about a dollar a box less by ordering these through Amazon rather than buying them at Whole Foods.  I not only like to eat healthier, I also like to trim the fat from my wallet.

review/text: Have really like the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries since I first found them in the grocery store.  Getting them from Amazon is even better, because they are much cheaper.  Amazon could do a better job packing them I think.<br /><br />Nature's Path could also offer a variety pack too for sell on Amazon.

review/summary: A healthier version of the popular breakfast pastry...
review/text: We've been on a pomegranate kick lately and my wife saw these Organic `Toaster Pastries' (don't call them Pop-Tarts) and snatched them up the other day.  She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).  These organic pastries are really good and taste pretty much exactly like a Pop-Tart, they even look just like them.  I won't take that step and say that they taste `better', but they taste pretty much the same.  The Cherry Pomegranate flavor is really good, although I would have like more pomegranates.  Instead, I get a lot of cherry.  That is the only reason I give this four stars instead of five.  If you put a flavor on the box, you should represent that flavor well in the pastry and these should have merely been called `Cherry' because that is the only flavor I get.  Still, as a whole you can't go wrong with these Organic pastries.  They are more expensive than your typical Pop-Tarts, and you get less in a box as well, but for peace of mind as a parent they are worth it.

review/text: For anyone that has never ate these, you're mind will be blown! Especially if you been eating such brands as Pop Tarts which use artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, and GMOs worst of all! These taste better and are better for you!They are made with REAL INGREDIENTS and I feel sorry for those who have never tried these and continue to eat the other brands. YOU ARE MISSING OUT! Its a win win situation with these. It'd be nice to buy them here, but keep in mind, other than grocery stores and health food stores I've found them at Walmart too. You can find them many places. Natures Path is one of the best organic companies too on top of that. Great to support.

review/summary: Tastes great, still like nearly candy but at least natural
review/text: I saw these at Big Lots for two bucks a box of six so I bought a few.  I'm not one to buy stuff and eat this type of sugary snack on a regular basis (or at least I refuse to see myself as someone who does), but the organic label was interesting so I gave it a try.  I suppose it helps me rationalize eating them if they are organic, because the more unhealthy and unnatural contents of the mainstream competitive products, in combination to the calories and sugar for this type of "food," is generally enough to dissuade me from buying them.<br /><br />I have eaten Pop Tarts before, and these are every bit as good and tasty or better.  I haven't eaten enough Pop Tarts to be really familar with the varieties and all that, but I think these Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries are not lacking in any way at all compared to my recollection of the artificial and non-organic/natural conventional products.  These were not dry or bland or stale or anything like that.  The only drawback at all I could find with them is the calories and sugar content.<br /><br />The one that I tried is the strawberry frosted style.  If I see more at Big Lots, I'll be picking up some more.

review/summary: Chocolate is excellent
review/text: First, I'd agree with everyone here who says this isn't a "healthy" food.  Because it's really not.  Lots of sugar in this.  But as a snack, it sure beats a lot of the other sugary treats out there, and it tastes good enough, that your kids won't feel deprived if you give them this instead of a twinky.  We also like that it's organic, since we have some issues with GMO foods- allergy type issues, not philosophical issues (not that there's anything wrong with philosophical issues, but ours is a true allergy).<br /><br />And if you want to be really decadent, when you go camping, you can toast marshmallows, and toast these (or not toast them) and use them to make a pretty darn good smore-like creation.

review/summary: Toaster Patries a Winner!
review/text: I absolutely love these, my kids love them too, lol. All the flavors are good with the exception of those chocolate ones (but I wasn't a chocolate pop tart fan either- but even them weren't bad just better to us cold, not hot). Either way these are one of the best and from one who could live on pop tarts in less healthier times is more content that this is a much better substitute. Not only are they organic, but they dont contain any artificial "icks". Bear in mind these types of foods are not for people who are trying to lose weight. It's not a protein bar it's a toaster pastry. It's good for people on the go, great for kids and those who want a more health conscious snack than their counterpart (not fat free, sugar free, but certainly better) and for parents who have chosen not to give artificially flavored, colored crap this makes me feel good (and their tasty!)<br />btw, if you love these you'll also go for the frosted apple cinnamon and blueberry :-D

review/text: The description kind of confused me, so I thought I was getting about twice as much. I misunderstood the 6-count boxes to mean that there were 6 packets (with 2 pastries each) per box, but there's only a total of 6 pastries/box. This is still plenty though.<br />Also, the expiration date was for only 5 months after I received them. So if you're ordering these, make sure they'll be eaten somewhat quickly.

review/summary: Incredibly Good; Puts Pop-Tarts to Shame
review/text: I never really ate Pop-Tarts until I was an adult.  When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the "original"?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with "natural" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.  If you want less sugar, just eat one of them in a sitting. :)

You can only eat so much cereal!  My kids had been big Pop Tart fans for years, so I wasn't sure if these would fly or not.  But, they loved them and never said a word about them being any different than the name brand.  They seemed happy and I was too knowing that there are no chemicals or high fructose corn syrup in them.<br /><br />They seemed to prefer the iced raspberry flavor.  Give them a try.  The price on Amazon is sooo much better than the natural markets.

review/text: For a couple boxes... they weren't too bad.  But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many.  I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic.

review/summary: Pop Tarts - Eat your heart out!!!
review/text: I purchased a case of 12 boxes (72 delicious little treats) - of these for $15.00.  I thought that, at that price, it would be worth it, even if they weren't any better than the high fructose corn syrup filled name brand Poptarts.  And I do not regret the decision one bit!<br /><br />The calories/fat/etc are very similar to those of regular Poptarts, but the ingredients are different - sweetened with cane juice, molasses, honey, etc.  They still are pink & covered with sprinkles, in case that's what you're into.<br /><br />The taste & consistency are really what you're interested in though, right?  Well - we've got a win-win situation.  The pastry itself is quite good, similiar to the consistency of a traditional toaster pastry - (in my experience, some foods made with whole wheat flour end up being sort of like paste in my mouth when I'm chewing - but that doesn't happen at all with these) - and the filling is DIVINE - it doesn't taste like a liquified fruit roll up (which is what I think of the cherry filling in a regular poptart) - you primarily taste the cherry - but the pomegranite (or "pomegran" as it says on the box) comes through as well.<br /><br />That being said - these are definitely worth the super low price I paid for them, and in the future, I'll most likely be willing to pay more if I have to - definitely superior to the ones you'll find in my local grocery store!!
