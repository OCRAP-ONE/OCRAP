review/summary: Taste great, Too close to expired expiration date.
review/text: Tastes great.  Good flavor, but consistency is thinner than regular ranch.  Disappointed that the expiration date on the packages was stamped for a date 2 months from when I received them.  I know they will still be okay after the date, but for freshness it would have been nice to have had at least six months to use them.  These were bought for lunches, so even putting one in a lunch 20 times a month would take 3 months to use them all.

review/summary: Better than the other guy says...and why.
review/text: I think this is pretty good pop. I wouldn't try to compare a mix with plain water to a well-prepared fresh pink lemonade, but this stuff is OK. Unfortunately, if you dilute it too much it gets bitter and acidic. The excess water causes extra ionization of the citric acid and lowers the Ph considerably. Make it with, at most, 48oz of spring water per package and you'll love it. Except if you want homemade lemonade...

review/text: This is a disappointing sugar free lemonade as bitter as yellow grapefruit juice even when diluted to one powder cup per gallon. I drink a Gallon of water with sugar free drink mix per day.  Crystal Light loses 1 star for using a cheap old sweetener, loses another star for being expensive, and loses a third star for tasting bitter instead of being closer to a Pink grapefruit flavor.

review/text: ....ergo, it may not be gluten-free.<br /><br />However, if they clean the lines in between, it might be safe: I'm not sure if they're gluten-free.  They don't seem like they're really contaminated, but I can't say for sure because I didn't eat more than one serving.<br /><br />This is a neat idea, but to really cook them so they don't fall apart, you have to cook them in hot water, then "shock" them with cold water, and repeat a couple of times, which is a fair amount of effort.  They also taste more like plants than noodles.  They're interesting, but I wouldn't buy them again, and the rest of the box went to a food bank.

review/summary: Awesome Pop and not Misleading
review/text: The pop is awesome and in the old fashion style painted glass bottles it makes it a special treat.<br /><br />In response to the first review. This listing is not misleading at all.  Its states that its vintage STYLING. Nothing in his listing says its vintage.  Yes it is sold in Michigan but if you live in any other state you can't buy it unless you drive all the way to Michigan. These dealers do people a service by offering something that is not readily available to everyone.  So it is not over priced when have to pay for the pop, deposit on the bottles, Amazon fees, not to mention the extra care in packing that is needed to ship full glass bottles.  I have shipped pop myself and I know how expensive it can get.  Bubblewrap is not cheap. If this dealer is paying on everything I mentioned I can guarantee you he is hardly making anything on this at $14.95.

review/summary: Newman's Organic Balsamic Vinegar of Modena
review/text: I bought this item in whole foods store. The label says Newman's Own Organic Balsamic Vinegar of Modena. Wanted to give this a try. My overall experience was OK if your'e drunk. But it could be way better.<br />-This thing is made from wine vinegar and cooked grape must that's mixed together<br />-Its NOT aged so it lacks that distinct earthy, woody aroma that you associate with a good balsamic vinegar<br />-It has 5 grams of sugar per tablespoon or 20 calories but you can barely taste the sweetness<br />-It tastes more like a red wine vinegar or even rice vinegar - light, fruity and fresh and has an acidic after taste similar to eating a lemon. In good quality aged balsamic vinegars you wont notice this high acidic aftertaste and it will be more sweet and mellow to the palate. Not this one. Overall this may be an OK vinegar for salad dressings but not so great for using it as a dip with olive oil. But its cheap and definitely not a total rip off.

review/text: From the time I was a little kid growing up in Brooklyn, My-T-Fine has been the platonic ideal of puddings. The most delicious imaginable, hands down, no question. Chocolate and vanilla have been my perennial favorites, but the butterscotch is also awfully good. I got a recent hankering for pudding and ordered 24 packs of each - chocolate and vanilla. Beats hell out of Jello brand. Makes great pies and banana pudding as well. Love the stuff.

The customer service operator was very nice, put me on hold for a couple of minutes, and then came back on the phone to verify that my opinion was correct. The formulas for the TEA and LEMONADE were changed. I gave him the bar code numbers and expiration dates on the both canisters. I will be receiving 2 coupons. Hopefully, the other flavors haven't changed.

review/summary: Healthy AND delicious!
review/text: I've been a huge fan of Coconut Secret products for a while now and buy their coconut nectar, crystals and aminos in bulk. So not surprisingly I expected to love their new bars and -- no surprises -- I did.<br /><br />I've tried both the Classic Coconut and Mint varieties now and this is my favorite of the two by far. As with the Classic Coconut, the chocolate coating is a bit on the melty side, not hard and waxy like a conventional chocolate bar, so don't leave them in the heat for too long.<br /><br />The mint flavor is perfectly balanced -- not too harsh, not too mild or understated. The cacao nibs add a crunch and texture that's irresistible. In fact, something about the combination of crunchy bits and mint flavor reminds me of mint Girl Guide cookies. Yum! They have that kind of "cookie crunch" taste and texture. But of course these contain no junk. They're not as sweet as a regular chocolate bar, are low-glycemic and contain under 300 calories per bar.<br /><br />These are simply delectable. I can't wait to try the other two flavors in the line. Be advised that if you're looking for a Mounds bar, you should buy a Mounds bar. Don't expect this to be an exact replica. But they are as delicious and healthy an alternative as you're going to find.

review/summary: So yummy!  Love these bars!
review/text: I just got done with the HCG diet so I was looking for a bar that was low in sugar (I actually ate these in P3 and did not gain weight).  I love coconut and I absolutely love these bars!  I have tried all of them except the one with nuts and my favorite is the Classic because I like that is has more chocolate.  The macaroon one is good too but it only has chocolate on the bottom where the classic is totally covered with it!  The mint is not my favorite.  It is good, but I am not a huge mint fan.  People say they are like Mounds, but it is not.  Mounds are gooey.  These are fairly dense in the inside but sweet and coconutty. It really satisfies my cravings for sweet in a very healthy way!<br /><br />I love these bars, the only downside is that they are pretty expensive!  I would eat 2 a day if I could afford it!

review/summary: Like a healthy Peanut Butter Oatmeal Cookie
review/text: I don't know why other reviewers have rated this bar so poorly (on other package sizes) - I loved it!<br /><br />I purchased this bar before reading the reviews and I'm glad, because if I'd read them, I wouldn't have tried it. The bar was sitting in my pantry, waiting to be eaten, when I thought to check what Amazon said about it. I read the reviews, and prepared myself for a bad experience. Opening the wrapper, I smelled a delightful aroma of pure peanut butter, with a slight hint of oats and wheat. The flavor is reminiscent of a peanut butter-and-oatmeal cookie, but made a little more mellow by the addition of healthy fiber. The texture is great - I feel like I'm actually eating something!<br /><br />So many nutrition bars are gone too soon, eaten in mere bites and leave me feeling like "why did I bother?", but not this bar! It was really good, start to finish. It's my favorite of the Gnu bars I've tried so far, and Gnu is definitely my favorite brand. They're healthy, full of fiber, and NOT full of the mystery ingredients that so many other bars contain, not to mention all the sugar! Plus, Gnu bars are vegan, dairy-free, and contain no trans fat, no high fructose corn syrup, and no artificial ingredients. They contain only healthy, real food ingredients. You can't go wrong!

review/text: My whole life I drank Coke never Pepsi. I took the Pepsi challenge in the 80's and could tell instantly which one was Coke. I couldn't stand diet Coke (the after taste!) Through the years I tried pretty much every natural cola out there, (my husband's idea) and it varied from I couldn't stand it, to just not liking it, that is until Virgil's. Virgil's cola has done what I didn't think possible, it has replaced Coke for me. It is now the only cola I drink, even when we go out to dinner, I no longer order Coke. Truly this is good stuff and nothing on the market comes close to it.<br />I would recommend their cream soda, root beer and black cherry soda as well. All are very good and all are made with sugar!<br /><br />And if you want the best root beer float it doesn't get better than Virgil's Root Beer with Breyer's Natural Vanilla with Vanilla Beans Ice Cream! Now I have to go make one. Enjoy!

And it has had relatively consistent taste and firmness, Both have now been altered, and not for the better, with the BIG-E versions. The packaging has also been altered in at least the winterfrost and spearmint products to a solid colored top which says it's the BIG-E version. So users beware to this change and stay with the non-BIG-E which has the original packing.

review/text: I must be out of my mind to pay this much for almond milk. I meant organic almond milk at whole food and trader's joe is about $2 a piece. I didn't pay attention, I've always assumed that I could get a better deal from amazon. In this case, it's not. Lesson learned.

review/summary: Always A Treat
review/text: Treacle toffee is always a treat. I first found it years ago while<br />visiting relatives in England. At first, I really didn't like it,<br />but at some point decided to try it again. Since then, I've sought<br />out places in the U.S. (stores or online) where I can buy it.<br /><br />  Treacle toffee generally wouldn't appeal to Americans; most seem<br />not to like it. BTW, "treacle" itself seems to be (nearly) equivalent<br />to "blackstrap molasses".<br /><br />  Am glad I can usually get this toffee online.

When I ordered it, I was expecting a different flavor and wasn't as keen on it, as I'd anticipated I would be.  Surprisingly, I have really come to crave it though... Yum - now if the company just didn't share the same name as our unethical governor here in WI...

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: My grandmother (who immigrated from England a lot of years ago) would always bring with her on a visit to us a box or more of 'Callard & Bowser' candies that she got stateside. She said as a young girl in England, she would always get these as a treat! As I recall, they were more of a butterscotch than a toffee, but they too were made with butter and were VERY good!! Well, unfortunately, Callard & Bowser are no more...why Nestle, why?? Well ,anyway, I bought these hoping to get a 'little bit of heaven' from the Walker Treacle Toffees.  I did, I did! They aren't the same as the C&B candies, but they are in the same league! I love these, and it is very difficult to not eat more than one should! I highly recommend them! Just a footnote: they have a stronger flavor due to the Treacle or molasses in them.  They really are oh so good tho'...

review/text: I tried this product because I have relatives who are diabetic and I'm always looking for low carb alternatives. The muffins have a somewhat cornbread kind of taste, and were a little dull in taste. I added a few frozen blueberries and this helped a lot.  My only complaint is that these mixes are quite expensive, and I may not be able to order as many as I would  like. They will have to be a treat rather than a staple....too bad.

review/summary: Go for the blueberry flavor from New Hope instead!
review/text: I bought both the Cranberry Orange flavor and the Blueberry New Hope muffins to try.  I've had several types of muffins in the past that were sugar free/low carb and I have to say that these taste pretty good.  I wasn't as happy with the flavor of the cran/orange flavor as i was with the blueberry flavor.  I would have given the blueberry muffins a 5 star rating.  I just love those!  When you make the cran/orange mix there are lots of cranberry pieces and you would think that the flavor would be pretty strong, but I didn't feel like I could taste the cranberry or orange after baking.  I made these according to the instructions and found them to be extremely oily.  Of course they would be with a 1/2 Cup of oil per 12 muffins.  When I made the blueberry muffins I cut the oil down to 1/4 Cup and still found the muffins to be tasty, moist, and flavorful, but without the oily fingers I used to have.  I recommend doing a search for the blueberry muffins on Google and getting those over the orange/cran flavor.

review/summary: Best Au jus ever!
review/text: I had a wonderful chateaubriand while on vacation a few years ago and was determined to make the meal once i returned home.  The recipe called for a very expensive demi glace from williams sonoma.  I made the meal and it was delicious, but I was very upset to spend $29 on a 6 oz jar (that I ruined because I did not realize it was concentrated). When I decided to remake it a year or so later, I searched Amazon first and found Savory Choice.  This demi glace was delicious and, I believe, better than the the WS brand.  My fiance kept asking me what did I do different and if there was any "sauce" left over for him to take home with him.  I also shared a package with a co-worker and she also received renowned reviews from her guest.  This demi glace can make the cheapest cut of meat taste like filet mignon....enjoy.

To counter the over-sweetness, I ate them together with a few walnuts (whole, in the shell--fresher tasting) and sometimes almonds....DEEEELICIOUS!

I use them in a simple sour cream sauce -mix in pepper purre, touch of cumin and a squirt of lime juice to taste. Use as a dip or on chicken etc. I use the puree for burgers too. Mix in one whole 12 oz can of the chipotle peppers (pureed) into 2 lbs of ground beef - add garlic and onion powder as well. Grill to your liking and top with cheddar and onion (cilantro is a good addition too!). I always get compliments on these smoky hot burgers. Good Luck.

This (along with a discount from Amazon.com) was one of the reasons I purchased the Davinci Whole Wheat pasta. I had never tried whole wheat pasta before, so I didn't know what was "good."<br /><br />It's not bad. Cooks well. Has a bit of a nutty flavor, but this doesn't overwhelm the spaghetti sauce. If the kids aren't ready for brown pasta, it can be mixed with normal angel hair pasta--just beware that whole wheat takes longer to cook, so you will have to prepare both pastas separately.<br /><br />Also, there are 12 boxes in the package--so if you don't know if you are going to like you may want to buy an individual box at the store first!

review/summary: Whole wheat pasta is a family favorite
review/text: In our house we eat a lot of organic and natural foods, so using the whole wheat pasta is a natural for us.  This cooked up evenly and nicely--very tasty with warm undertones.  I paired it with the various Scarpetta organic pasta sauces (you can get these on Amazon, too).  The taste of the pasta doesn't overpower or conflict with the pasta sauces or any of the meats I have paired with it.  It's lovely as a simple side dish topped with nothing but olive oil and freshly grated parmesan cheese.<br />Enjoy :)

review/summary: Quality, Convenience, and Great Price!
review/text: I am very happy with this product - as with the penne.  I do not have to worry about entering this on my shopping list, as I have it on a time-scheduled delivery; which creates additional savings AND ships free!  Overall, I am receiving a quality product; at a price lower than my local grocers.<br /><br />May 11, 2009; My last two shipments of this product had inferior packaging by the manufacturer.  I was not too concerned with the problem when it first happened.  Upon receiving the second shipment, I contacted worldfiner.com customer service.  I wanted to make them aware of their inferior product packaging.  This was not an Amazon.com packaging problem.  Worldfiner.com customer service response follows: "Please contact Amazon."<br /><br />I gave the manufacturer a chance to respond with concern.  Maybe it was my fault - could I have been too descriptive with the details of the inferior packaging.  I think I lost their customer service representative after the third sentence.  I canceled my "subscribe & save" future orders for this product.

review/summary: The Spaghetti wasn't the Only Thing Soaked!
review/text: Whole-wheat pasta is better for you.  However, this brand, Davinci is an absolute ripoff.  It is about $3 per box for only 12 oz.  To give a perspective, one could buy 16oz boxes of whole-wheat spaghetti for $1 per box and it will taste just as good.<br /><br />One would think that the pasta is organic at this staggering price, but no it is just regular whole-wheat pasta in a small 12oz. box.  This is definitely a case of not getting what you pay for!

review/text: These are surprisingly good considering they are sugar free and low carb!  I ended up also buying the 5 pound box of assorted carmels and a 5 pound box of the englis toffee.  Although the variety carmel box did not have the pecan carmels it had 4 other flavors that were also delicious - I still like the pecan carmels better though.  The chocolate carels came in second.  The English toffee was even better than I had hoped - too good - the 5 pounds went quickly...

review/text: I bought these after reading all the good reviews.  I was not paying attention when I placed my order, because I did not realize that I would be getting only 8 pieces of candy for $15.00. Seems like a lot of money just for 8 pieces! I tried one of the candies today and if it wasn't for the pecans it wouldn't have any flavor at all.  I will never buy this product again.  Werthers has a far better tasteing product for way less the cost, and you get way more for your money.

review/text: I was skeptical at first, but I wanted to give this product a chance. I've been having hot flashes for 10 years! I went on HRT for awhile but had to come off (you can't stay on it forever). After I stopped the HRT, the hot flashes returned. I tried Restore, not expecting much. I carried it around because you're supposed to spray it as soon as the hot flash starts. I spray it on my neck and chest and immediately feel better!  I really like this product!

review/text: I have to say, as Whiskey and Bourbon drinker I have found good old Seagrams 7 to be a wonderful Whiskey.  It has been around for some time, sold a few times but has remained a consistent, easy to drink blended Whiskey.  As we all know with Bourbon, it can be a bit harsh on the body after a few drinks; not so with Seagrams 7. Always smooth, easy to mix and just flat out a good Whiskey to have around all the time.  I guess the fact it is sold at Costco in quantity in California is testament to it's popularity.  Enjoy and share with your friends!

Very, very chewy, which I liked, and not too fake tasting, but I'd rather have a candy bar (snickers, butterfinger) for the amount of calories and kind of fat and sugar I'm getting from eating this bar.

review/summary: Excellent and Tasty High Protein Real Food Bar
review/text: I purchased this bar the other day at a local retailer. I have to admit, it looks prety bad, kind of like a beef jerky stick that went obese. Anyway, I read the ingredients and everything was organic and all that. They had little sugar and only 170 calories, with a higher protein content, so I grabbed a hot pepper bar and the regular tanka bar. I was looking for a higher protein, lower carb, lower calorie snack made with real food and this fit the bill. To my surprise, they tasted very good and even my 15 year old step daughter liked them, no small feat. My only complaint is that the price is a wee bit high. However, after going to the company website and doing some research, it occured to me that the meat is buffalo (duh) and the fruit is cranberry, sounds weird but tasted good. I like to support native americans and eat something real and healthy, so I guess it takes a bit more to actually use food instead of mass produced soy and whey protein powders.

review/summary: Another Great Coffee from Green Mountain
review/text: Green Mountain's Our Blend Fair Trade K-Cups are perfect for someone who is looking for a mild coffee flavor.  This coffee has a smooth taste that is rich but not overpowering.  Although I often prefer a bolder flavor, the Our Blend is light and delicious and sure to be my go-to coffee for company.  It's great as a stand-alone flavor but also blends nicely with sugar or flavored creamers.<br /><br />Best of all, it's a Fair Trade Certified coffee, which means that farmers must follow strict labor laws and practices, adhere to environmental standards, and be paid a fair price for their products.  Kudos to Green Mountain for offering a responsible product!<br /><br />Although I was already a loyal Green Mountain customer, I got the chance to try Green Mountain's Our Blend Fair Trade Certified K-Cups as a free sample because I'm a BzzAgent.  This product is going to be added to my regular coffee rotation!

Most of them were way too strong for me and I would end up diluting them - but "Our Blend" was just right - smooth, medium light flavor without bitterness.  It is one that I can drink black - or add cream, sugar or a flavored creamer to comfortably without losing the richness of the coffee.  I recommend it to those who enjoy a good cup of coffee that won't jolt the system.

People wonder why my food is better than theirs -- it's probably the addition of these anchovies!  (I even use the olive oil in the bottom of the jar after the anchovies are used up.  Really wonderful!)  They come with a little fork, which makes them easy to remove from the jar, and I have several forks now.  What do you do with them after a while?  They are cheaper from my local store, though.  They do not require refrigeration -- I just keep mine on the counter -- even after it's been opened.  However, I live in the NE, so maybe in the South you might need to be wary of temps.

review/summary: These are okay, but you can do better for your cat & wallet
review/text: We have two cats who are addicted to treats.<br />Okay, we made them that way. We fed them Temptations for years, before we really took the time to read the labels and understand what the ingredients really were. That brand is about the same as flavored potato chips for humans - flavor enhancers are added to make us crave the item. Temptations does the same for your cat. No wonder they didn't want to stop eating them!<br /><br />Anyway, we were on the hunt for a healthier treat that wasn't full of kitty junk food.<br />Both our cats love chicken and could care less about tuna or fish flavors, so this was one of the items we tried.<br />The ingredients are top-notch, and the treat's size is really good for cats.<br /><br />However, while both cats get excited about the bag being opened (like a can opener sound or popping the lid on wet cat food),<br />I could swear I hear them sigh when they see this bag! While they do eat these, it isn't a favorite by any means. Both will eat a few pieces then walk away, almost unheard of in all previous treat feeds of all brands. I can leave a few out and they'll get eaten, but it is probably out of boredom, not because they want them. One of our favorite games with both cats is tossing a treat for them to catch. They both love to do this, but are too bored to play catch with these treats. While I am glad that these do not contain the kitty version of MSG, it also needs to have something more appealing to the cats too.<br /><br />There is enough chicken in this to make it a decent product for your cat. However, there also doesn't seem to be a lot of flavor, in their opinion. While I did not buy mine at Amazon, no matter where you shop, Halo treats are pretty costly, given what<br />they are - little round pieces of cat food.<br /><br />We won't be buying them again. For a few dollars more, we can get a 3-lb sack of very healthy cat food that we can use as treats instead. Right now, we are using Blue Buffalo cat food as their treat. They both adore it, it is full of healthy ingredients too (despite being more grains than I really think cats need), and you get a lot more value. We also use Eukanuba dry food as treats, and both of those brands are very popular with both of our cats.<br /><br />So, while everyone's cats have different likes/dislikes just like we humans do, I'd put my money into some other brand.<br />If this one came way down in price, then it would be an okay value as an extra treat.<br />But, for the premium pricing on a bag of treats, you can do just as well by your cat with other brands.<br />There is nothing really special about these, and don't have either the flavor or fragrance to get our cats too excited about them.<br />I think we were all a little disappointed with the Halo chicken treats.

review/summary: My cats who will eat ANYTHING will not touch these!
review/text: I have 3 cats and they are little piggies and none of them would touch these...wouldn't even TRY them. One of my cats will eat just about anything you offer him and he wouldn't even try them. They gobble up the Liv-a-littles dehydrated chicken so I thought I'd try these.  Looks like raccoons are getting these! I do not recommend!!

review/summary: Hunger strike
review/text: I bought these treats as well as the Halo daily food thinking that I'd give my 4 year old cats something a bit healthier for them. Trouble insued at the food dish. Neither cat will eat these treats or the bagged food. It could be the odor, not too appetizing or the size- very small pellets. Whatever it was, they wouldn't eat it and I'm back to purina one.

review/text: My 2 cats, who will literally eat anything, won't eat these treats. I've tried to give them both flavors, but they just walk away...strange.

review/summary: My cats said I should give these zero stars
review/text: My cats always adore treats, and I was prepared to get purrs when I offered these.  The cats didn't eat them when I put them down - and I tried placing them in the bowl of dry food - but they were left untouched.  They are extremely hard and very small.  Unfortunately I purchased several packages of this and the other flavor.  Possibly a raccoon or squirrel will eat them.

review/summary: My cats won't eat them
review/text: My reclaimed feral cats normally mob me for treats.  These are very hard and must not have a good taste.  I was really disappointed that Halo would produce something this bad and that Amazon would sell it.
