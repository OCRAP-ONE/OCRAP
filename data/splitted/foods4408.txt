review/summary: An excellent cocoa...
review/text: After enjoying Van Houten for a long time I suddenly found it very hard to acquire so I went looking for a replacement.  I found this cocoa on Amazon and ordered some as a test.  Once I had this I was able to also acquire a little more of the Van Houten to compare them head to head.  They are both excellent cocoas and I think most people would be very happy with either one.  I personally have a slight preference for the Van Houten, but I've never felt like I was consuming anything less than a superlative cocoa when I've had the Callebaut.  Also at the current time, the Callebaut is trivial to acquire in almost any quantity, but I still struggle to get the Van Houten, so it's becoming a practice in frustration.<br /><br />Just buy this, the price is good and the cocoa is excellent.

review/text: I've reviewed this cocoa previously because I buy it periodically. It's the only cocoa I'll buy. It was rated the best cocoa by the testers on America's Test Kitchen television program (Cooks Illustrated magazine), and it lives up to that rating. It's smooth, with no burned or harsh aftertaste. It's expensive, but worth every penny.

review/text: Callebaut Baking Cocoa Powder is the best cocoa I have ever baked with. It makes you cake richer with a more chocolatey taste. I baked a red velvet cake and my daughter ate a piece she said that other other red velvet cakes  she has eaten was not as chocolately as mine I told her it was the cocoa that I purchased at Amazon. Can't wait until I try it again. I tell everyone this is the best cocoa powder ever.

review/text: I tried this after reading lots of reviews and wanting to improve my baked goods' flavor.  I'm a bona fide convert now.  This stuff is like powdered ambrosia.  It's a dark rich chocolate brown color -- much darker than Hershey's or other supermarket brands you'd buy.  And the end result in my cookies and brownies is undeniable.  REALLY.  Had I not known I simply changed the cocoa powder I was using, I would have thought it was a different, much better recipe I was trying.  THAT awesome a difference.  I won't ever go back to cheaper, regular cocoa powders.

review/text: I bought this cocoa because it was highly rated by Cooks Illustrated. I have used Hersheys and Nestles in the past but I know there is a whole world of cocoa I know nothing about.<br />The only problem I had was with the packaging. The bag was slit up the side and repackaged in a plastic bag which had leaked into the cardboard box. Someone in the vendor's warehouse was having a bad, bad day. I sent it back and Amazon was wonderful about refunding my money.<br />I did buy this product again and it did not disappoint. This chocolate is easy to use and makes the best chocolate sorbet and frozen yogurt in the world. I used it with the EuroPro yogurt maker and the Cuisinart ice cream/sorbet maker both purchased from AMAZON.

review/summary: CAREFUL!!  SHIPPING COSTS MORE THAN COOKIES !!
review/text: I suggest you be careful before ordering this item, I can not see that any cookie is worth $10.50 even if it tastes great! Even if we poor Celiac patients have to make do with much dry backed goods, and I mean some of it is dust-storm-dry, even so, I just can not justify to pay more for the shipping then for the cookies themselves. So make sure you always check the shipping charges before ordering anything, especially since cookies are not a food group, unfortunately. I have been in internet shopping and selling from its start and I know many sellers do try and make some extra income charging unreasonable rates for shipping by calling it HANDLING charges. This cookie bag weighs only 3.7 oz and I don't care how good you pack it this does not cost $5.05 for shipping. Did you know that a 1 oz letter costs $.44?<br />I am sorry if I sound angry, but as a Celiac I am very much upset for being taken advantage of because I have a disease which makes me have to shop for special foods. And this is exactly what is going on here. By the time you have ordered from 4 to 6 sellers you end up paying enough for shipping that you could live off another month, and that is robbery. So I decided enough is enough and I am making sure you know about it before you go through quick check out(worst way to go!) or having to go back after having spent so much time online comparing prices just to find at checkout that you can't afford it because of such excess shipping charges.

review/summary: Nice sampler at an affordable price
review/text: I'm on a low-carb diet that involves eating lots of fat-free yogurt, which gets boring with just vanilla flavoring. While these flavors are probably more suitable for baking, I've found them an enjoyable addition to yogurt and soy. My collection included hazelnut and raspberry instead of coconut and rose. For me, the standouts were the hazelnut, coffee, raspberry and mango (which has a surprising natural, fresh flavor). The only real loser was lime, which has a weak, Lifesaver-type flavor. The rum and chocolate aren't to my taste, but I imagine those flavors are very difficult to mimic. Overall, I'm pleased and will be ordered a couple of flavors individually when my little 1-ounce bottles are empty.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: Pretty close to what I used to have back in Japan. Anyone new to shirataki, be prepared for an awful fishy smell when you open the bag. The fluid they come in is the source of the smell, so if you rinse them off you'll be rid of it. I recommend rinsing out the bag they came in as well before you put it in the trash.<br /><br />These don't have much flavor of their own, and they're not supposed to, so don't judge them by tasting straight out of the package. The texture won't be what you're expecting either if someone told you these could substitute for spaghetti. They're very rubbery. Cook them in something, preferably a soup stock if you want to enjoy them they way they were meant to be eaten. If you intend to use them with a pasta sauce, put them in the sauce while you're warming it up. If you just pour the sauce on them after the fact, they won't have much chance to absorb the flavor.<br /><br />For best results, before using in any sauce or liquid of your own, throw them in a very hot non-stick skillet on high and swish them around for 1 min until they start making a squeaking sound. This will get rid of some of the liquid they've already absorbed so that they can absorb more flavor from what you cook them in.<br /><br />Cooked properly, these can become a delicious and filling part of a meal.

review/summary: So happy to find these here!
review/text: I love these noodles. While no one would every mistake them for "spaghetti", they contain zero carbs and fat, zero calories, and zero Weigh Watcher points. Once you rinse them well and heat them up (they don't really need to be cooked), you can pour on any kind of sauce or use them in a stir fry in place of any other Asian noodle and you'll be satisfied in knowing that you can eat your fill but not be going overboard on caloric intake. Of course, if you use a lot of oil or a rich sauce like alfredo (yum), you'll need to take that into account.<br /><br />I used to live near a large international market and was able to pick these up weekly, as I needed them. They were actually not called "Miracle Noodle" but were the same product, with Japanese writing on the bags. They were also about 1/2 the price of Miracle Noodles. However, no longer being able to find them anywhere nearby, I was very happy to order these on amazon. The price seems reasonable, and they were quickly shipped right to my door.<br /><br />I learned from reading other reviews here that these can also be frozen until ready for use. That's a big plus and was pivotal in my decision to order a whole case. I'll probably go through them rather quickly so opted to order them on auto-ship at an additional discount. For those of you who haven't used amazon's auto-ship option, I highly recommend that for any grocery item that you're likely to reorder regularly. You can change the time of your next shipment, skip a shipment, cancel future orders, and amazon notifies you a reminder when it is getting close to the time of your next shipment. Very user friendly!

The only stipulation I make is that I don't mind the smell per se but I do have a reaction to it by getting a headache.  So I share my solution to the solution it's kept in: drain the noodles in a strainer and rinse with cold water.  Place noodles in bowl adding cold water to cover.  Add a splash of white vinegar.  I need to soak them for more than fifteen minutes or else headache appears but after ten or fifteen minutes the noodles are done soaking.  I leave them to drain in the strainer for a few minutes over the bowl.  Use as you like.  I find this easier than the recommended method.  I prepare the base food while the noodles soak and drain.  Bon Appetit!

review/summary: Interesting and very low cal alternative to pasta
review/text: If you want to cut calories to help lose weight or want a healthy alternative to typical pasta products and you aren't adverse to trying a pasta "substitute", then these black shirataki noodles just might be the trick. But there are a few things you need to be aware of: there'll be a really fishy smell when you open the bag - don't know why, since the noodles are made from a plant - but rinsing under water will make most of that smell go away. And you do need to make sure they're really dried off before using, in order to not add more liquid to whatever you're mixing them with and also so they will absorb more of a sauce you might be putting on them. The manufacturer suggests putting the rinsed and drained noodles in a hot pan and "sauteing" for about a minute (took me longer) until they make a squeaky sort of sound to really remove all the excess moisture.<br /><br />I first tried these noodles with spaghetti sauce - absorbed and held the sauce very well and really they were pretty close to pasta. But, a little part of me detected that fishy smell - faint, yes, but it was still there. A tiny bit unpleasant, since that's not a smell I want with a dish that doesn't have fish in it! Maybe boiling them for a minute before using like the manufacturer suggests in certain recipes, but not all, found on their site, may help. Or maybe rinsing under running water for a longer period of time is the answer.<br /><br />The only other thing I found is that the 7oz. bag really isn't quite enough for a meal portion for me - maybe 1-1/2 bags will do. I'm not an over-eater but I think I'd be more satisfied, especially if using these in place of a main course pasta dish, to use more than one bag per serving.<br /><br />But I like them, am learning to figure out how to best cook with them and will be ordering more. Amazon's 12-pack price is the best deal I could find - even better than buying from  the manufacturer's website.

review/text: For health reasons, I must maintain a low carb diet. I was .2 over the line into pre-diabetes. My MD, luckily, has a Nutritionist on site who taught me how to eat.<br />Within 2 months I lost 25 lbs and my glucose levels are normal. Part of what helps<br />me keep disciplined are these noodles...........When I have a pasta craving, or when my<br />meals seem too boring, I use thse noodles. As the noodles have no taste I've learned to<br />be creative with recipes..i.e. I mix them with sundried tomatoes in olive oil, pepper, garlic, grated parmasean cheese and nuke them for 1 1/2 minutes.........The taste is great, ZERO calories for the noodles<br />and I am full and satisfied after dinner. I use them with fish, turkey burgers, steak, chicken dinners. I have them on auto delivery with Amazon as I don't want to run out of them. I highly recommend them to anyone who must watch their weight and/or food intake.

review/summary: Love the noodles!
review/text: I'm on a very strict, Dr. prescribed low carb diet.  These noodles fit perfectly into the eating plan.  I followed one reviewer's instructions and rinsed the noodles thoroughly before cooking 1 minute in the microwave and adding to other foods.  I too found them to be a bit rubbery and chewy.  What I do now is after rinsing and before cooking I cut them into smaller pieces.  Cook them for one minute.  Rinse again then add them to whatever I'm cooking whether it be a stir fry, sauces, etc.  I find they no longer feel or taste rubbery and they absorb the flavor of whatever I'm cooking nicely.  Are these noodles for everyone?  Of course not. There's always going to be someone who will find fault in whatever they try or they're not willing to experiment to make it work.  For me they're a great product and I use them as an integral part of my eating plan.

review/summary: Good fuel...no more bonk
review/text: I discovered I had a Gluten allergy and had to switch from my former product (which I loved). Gu's Roctane works even better. It mixes easily and goes down well. The carbs it provides have made 50 - 70 mile rides go by without the bonk and have lessened lactic build up. More important, it has let this nearly 60 year old keep up with his 45 year old riding buddies. They are wondering what got into me, but I won't tell them. I use it with a Roctane gel pack every hour.<br /><br />Good stuff. I highly recommend it. It's hard to find, but BikeSomewhere's service was fantastic. The product arrived earlier than promised. Great service, great price. I'll just continue ordering from them and not worry about shopping locally for the product.

review/summary: Great energy booster for those long cycling rides
review/text: I stumbled across this product at my local bike shop prior to doing a 40 mile ride (my 1st 40 miler).  I am diabetic and always concerned that I'd be on a long ride and my glucose levels would tank leaving me in a very bad situation - if you are diabetic then you know what I mean (similar to bonking as the term is used in cycling) but probably a bit more serious.  Because of the diabetes, I would not take my medicine before my rides (I typically ride very early mornings) because of my concern of low levels, but with this product, I no longer have those concerns.  I wanted something light (don't like heavy meals when riding, don't like milky type drinks or overly sweet tasting drinks when riding either) that would keep me going once I got out on the road and this was just the ticket.  I use it as a supplement to my one pack of oatmeal meal before a ride along with a honey stinger organic waffle and banana; it keeps the energy levels up and includes ingredients to keep your electrolytes in order, too - not too bad, huh.  During those long rides is a time when I as a diabetic welcome loads of carbs and bit of caffeine don't hurt either.  It mixes well and the taste is very very light, too; I like the tropical fruit flavor.  At first I thought it was something wrong because the taste was so light, but later read that that's how it is.  I carry 2 water bottles on all my rides and this energy drink will definitely be one of the two drinks that go with me on my rides.  Before buying a jug, you can try one of the single packs to see if you like it and which flavor you like best; they actually taste pretty good.  I would not recommend this to those that are couch potatoes though, especially diabetic couch potatoes.

This don't taste as great and is not as effective as Perpetuem from Hammer. There is no protein component in this mix. The ratio in Perpetuem has worked well for me, this Roctane drink failed miserably. I will finish the canister during my workouts at the gym.

The difference is that the parched corn won't break your teeth and there are more of them to the bag! Yes they are dry, and they do suck the moisture from your mouth.  However, the taste is a concentrated blue corn chip flavor, a favorite of mine, and I can't get enough!

review/text: I was wanting to try parched corn to see if I liked it, before thinking about trying to make my own.  Commercial parched corn seems VERY hard to come by, this was actually all I was able to find.  One might have more luck hitting up small local stores, maybe.<br /><br />At any rate, I did very much enjoy this product.  I was worried it would be very hard, but it isn't.  Has a very nice flavor.  I have to disagree with an earlier reviewer who complained that it dried his mouth out badly.  It's no worse than any other salty snack I've had in that regard.  Though I know it'd be more economical to make my own, I think the price is good enough that I'd buy again (considering shipping is included).  Especially given that my attempt at it will likely not be as good as this.

Upon opening these 3 boxes the expiration date is 11/24/10.<br /><br />After calling the vendor and being on the same hold mode for 10 minutes, a rep Adina got on the phone. I provided her with every detail I had. She advised me to take a pic & send it to them. I told her I would not feed my daughter anything expired and she told me she would. Rep told me I could find their e-mail address on the packing slip rather than being professional to give it to me herself. (Probably feeding HER kids expired food as she told me she would) digusting!!!<br /><br />To say the least, I know that when I hit the send button when I e-mailed her 3 pics of the dates AND my packing slip, I will not get a replacement of it. I don't feel that this young, inexperienced young woman, should be representing/selling a billion dollar empire as Amazon.<br /><br />Needless to say, I do expect what Adina promised which was a replacement of the muffins, and quote "you can keep what you have, I don't care". As a business woman, I remained composed and mature.<br /><br />If it isn't from Amazon direct, be sure it is a reputable company. Next time I'll just go to the supermarket for this item!!!<br /><br />Perhaps Natural Health Shoppe can give a course of proper customer service to their workers. Take a lesson from Amazon reps, they are wonderful.<br /><br />Disappointed from Brooklyn!!<br />Melissa

review/summary: best if used by date is not expiration date...
review/text: Entenmann's has "best if used by" dates on its Little Bites Chocolate Chip Muffins, not expiration dates or sell by dates (which can all mean different things, but Entenmann seems to use "best if used by" as a synonym for "last sale date" according to my box - the date past which the distributor collects them for returns so that the customer gets the fresher product unless deliberately buying older product at a reduced price). It's the kind of product that does have a shorter "best by" shelf life than other products, though, and so getting it by mail order is a gamble - there is no way to know if you will be getting it close to the best by date or not (unless the vendor helpfully includes that info, as one online vendor I use does).<br /><br />However. if I myself had received a box of it on the "best by" date (as the other poster did), I would just have made sure I froze all of them except what I was going to eat that week or the next (actually, the companies build in a lot more leeway than that in their "best by" dates). The local grocery store still sells it on that date, so people routinely buy it on the "best by" date. I usually freeze baked goods like this, anyway. Donuts, muffins, slices of cake or pie - they all typically freeze extremely well and thaw fast. But that's why the other poster's customer service rep was so confused - she knew it wasn't really expired and the date wasn't listed as an expiration date, and the product was certainly safe to eat and still safe to sell on that date. The question that should have been asked is "How long past the "best used by" date is the product safe to eat?" She might have been able to find an answer for that. Otherwise, she followed normal protocol, asking the customer to send the appropriate portions of the box back (or just to take a picture of it). They need to do that for verification. Their chocolate chip little bites muffins are too tasty to not take that precaution .... :)<br /><br />If there's a bigger discrepancy between receipt and the best by date (or a real expiration date), such as months out of date, or any obvious problem with the food product, I've just contacted Amazon and received a refund if I bought it here.

review/summary: Best dipping sauce so far.
review/text: We've been eating a lot of "sushi" lately, and I was looking for an alternative to wasabi for my child.  I found this stuff by chance.  Fantastic!  Its a very sweet sauce with a medium burn, and loads of garlic flavor.  Imagine those bland duck sauce packets you get with take out, then add garlic and chilies.  Its not what you would normally use on real sushi.  The taste is too strong if you enjoy the subtle flavors of the different fish.  But at our house, we make a roll with rice, cooked shrimp and green onions.  These are strong tasting anyway, and this compliments them perfectly.<br />This would be great on spring rolls, dumplings, or Thai BBQ too.  One of the must haves in our kitchen.

The only downside is that I haven't yet found anyone that sells a big bag of these yet... but at least you can buy the small bags in bulk on Amazon.

review/summary: Can we have the sugar back, please?
review/text: I realize that perhaps I should have read the label, but if the bottle doesn't say "artificially sweetened" then the consumer has an expectation that formulations have not been changed.  Tang is now just nasty tasting.<br /><br />Tang has been reformulated to include not one...but Three artificial sweeteners, two of which have not had significant peer reviewed human testing and one of which is a known chemical danger.<br /><br />I realize that companies want to make a profit by using something cheaper than sugar, but this is ridiculous.<br /><br />sucralose = splenda: Splenda (sucralose) is trichlorosucrose. It contains a primary unhindered alkyl chloride that one would not be surprised to find reactive as an alkylating agent with protein pendent lysine residues and other nucleophiles (including anchimeric assistance with one anomer and the open form). One is generally ill-advised to chronically ingest halogenated organics as food.<br /><br />Acesulfame potassium: Several potential problems associated with the use of acesulfame have been raised. They are based largely on animal studies since testing on humans remains limited. The findings showed the following: Acesulfame K has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion in rats in a dose-dependent fashion thereby possibly aggravating reactive hypoglycemia ("low blood sugar attacks"). Acesulfame K apparently produced lung tumors, breast tumors, rare types of tumors of other organs (such as the thymus gland), several forms of leukemia and chronic respiratory disease in several rodent studies, even when less than maximum doses were given. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, it was petitioned for a stay of approval by the FDA because of "significant doubt" about its safety.<br /><br />NeoTame: As its patent for aspartame was running out, Monsanto developed a new, more potent version of its synthetic sweetener.  By adding 3-dimethylbutyl (a chemical the Environmental Protection Agency lists as hazardous) to aspartame, scientists at Monsanto drastically increased the sweetening power of the additive. The new version was named neotame.  The non-profit group, Truth in Labeling, gained access to some of the neotame studies. They write, "At the time of our review of Monsanto's application, three human studies on the safety of neotame were presented. The studies had few subjects, all of whom were employees of the company. Some of the subjects reported headaches after ingesting neotame, but the researchers concluded that the headaches were not related to neotame ingestion. Not mentioned in the studies was the fact that migraine headache is, by far, the most commonly reported adverse reaction to aspartame in the files of the FDA."

review/text: Use this stuff for cycling. It's hard to explain, but when you've burnt 5,000 calories in a day sweating under the hot sun, strange things sound good, and to a lot of cyclists, some nice strong Tang sounds really, really good. Sure, there's Gatorade mix and Naan, but a strong orangy citrus punch packs killer refreshment. But... what the hell!?! Artificially sweetened? That's not good for cycling *or* for kids. What's with the obsession with trying to turn every drink into "Shasta"? We hate Shasta. We're not skinny blonde bimbos trying to look cool on the beach and hook up with Mr. Moneybags. If the market has spoken and people have declared they wanted anything, it's good, old fashioned sugar. Not HFCS. Not sucralose. Not Nutrasweet. Not friggin' Sacrin. Sugar.

review/summary: AWESOME TREATS!!
review/text: The Crunchy Tricky Trainers are such great treats - small, super yummy (well, I assume so - my pups go nuts for them), and low fat/low calorie. We do quite a bit of "rewarding" in our house, and these treats are definitely a favorite. They also work well with treat-dispensing toys. We recently got one of our little pug mixes to do "high-five's" for Tricky Trainers - so cute! Cloud Star makes such great products, and I know I can trust that they have top notch, USA-made ingredients in every bag.<br /><br />Our overweight pug mixes really enjoy these small treats, as they get to eat more of them than some of the other larger treats we have in our house (for them, it's all about quantity!).  A+ on these treats, Cloud Star!!

Since the cost of this product is $47.95 plus shipping for a case of 12 packages, make sure you really are desperate for a Stella D'Oro before ordering.

review/summary: Great little tree a great price
review/text: The seller shipped the tree very quickly via express mail.  It was packed well to protect the tree.  The tree is smaller than I imagined from the picture.  This was somewhat silly on my part, since they said it is a bonsai, which means it should be small but look big.  The tree is about 9 inches tall and potted in a cup sized plastic pot.  I've transplanted it to a gallon sized pot, which should give it room for few years, since these trees are very slow growing.  Though small, the tree is in spectacular condition with a mass of tiny leaves.  Mine is even better looking than the one pictured.<br /><br />I plan to let the tree grow into a full sized potted tree.  I plan to keep in outside until cool weather and then bring it inside for the winter, since I live in USDA zone 7.  When it gets bigger, the tree should look similar to a potted ficus tree.  I saw a picture of a grown one bearing fruit and had to have one of my own even though it can't survive winter outside in my area.  In a few years it will bear grape-like fruits, which are attached to the trunk rather than the ends of limbs as is normal for almost all other fruit trees.

review/text: Jaboticaba is a delicious tropical fruit, but it is difficult to find plants outside of Florida. The plants received were good-sized for 4-inch pots, and they grew well for me. A year later, they have quadrupled their size (it's a slow-growing tree). My only regret is that the plants were not labeled as to variety. There are several cultivars with different fruit qualities and fruiting seasons. (It's irrelevant that the nursery is selling seedlings. Most jaboticaba "seedlings" are in fact apomictic, meaning that they are exact clones of the parent tree.)

review/text: Being a polyfloral honey, it does not have a particular flavor, and will vary from season to season. However, since it is partially cactus nectar, it is a bit more savory than wildflower honey. It also has a slightly bitter-sweet aftertaste, which is a nice contrast. This is good for those who don't like overly sweet honeys.

review/text: I pursued Lyle's Golden Syrup after seeing a recipe for British Flapjacks in Bon Appetit magazine without having tried the product ever before.  The syrup presents itself with a golden hue and a consistency that resembles liquid honey.  The aroma is that of a lightly toasted/caramelized sugar with a nutty tone.  The taste matches the aroma with a concentrated yet not overpowering sweetness.  After I made the flapjacks, all four of us in our family tasted them and were extremely impressed with the flavor that the Golden Syrup adds.  Any of our friends that tasted them were quite delighted as well.  I found further recipes available at Tate & Lyle's website per the on-can text.  If you haven't tried Lyle's Golden Syrup and are at all considering it, I encourage you experience its unique flavor.

review/text: If the recipe absolutely calls for corn syrup use corn syrup but if it doesn't you may want to try using this instead.

review/summary: Damaged can
review/text: Received can with large dent. The box was in good shape, so can was damaged before shipment. The main reason I ordered this product was for the decorative can.The same was true of a can of Black Treacle ordered from the same supplier at the same time and delivered in the same box.

review/summary: Best and healthiest meat tenderizer ever!
review/text: I've been using this Spike Tenderizer Magic (starting when it was known as Indo) for a good 20 years - it's my secret ingredient for great steaks (and roasts, too)!  It's pretty salty, so it's best used in a light sprinkle.  Put it on about 30 minutes before cooking, along with some herbs and black pepper.  I used to buy it 6 jars at a time from Whole Foods, but their distributor doesn't carry it any more.  I hope it stays available online forever!!!
