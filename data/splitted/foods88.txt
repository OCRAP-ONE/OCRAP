review/summary: my cats' favorite food
review/text: My cats (who are different in almost every way) totally agree on this food - its healthy so i dont feel guilty spoiling them, they slurp all the juices, nom all the real meat, chomp the nuggets and veggies and lick their lips forever after ! I am a huge fan of all Merrick foods but the Pot Pie, Turducken, Thanksgiving Dinner, and California Roll are my cats' favorites!

review/text: 810 MILIGRAMS OF SALT PER SERVING is not a healthy amount!  Yet the<br />other ingredients in this condensed soup make it SO delicious, even<br />a "salt counter" like myself finds it hard to resist!  THIS IS NOT<br />A SNACK-FOOD!  It needs to be MIXED with other, preferably totally<br />salt-free ingredients!  Not only a soup can be made with this<br />"condensed yumminess".  I have used it, (with salt-free tuna and/or<br />salmon), instead of mayonaise, and added bread crumbs, for a<br />delicious tuna spread!<br /><br />So -- enjoy this condensed soup!  Just be aware of the absolutely<br />t-r-e-m-e-n-d-o-u-s amount of dangerous sodium in it, and drink,<br />eat, and cook with it, accordingly.<br /><br />...............................................................<br /><br />NOTE TO CAMPBELL'S: I realize that salt here is used as a preservative.  But VITAMIN E is also a good preservative.  Perhaps<br />you could use less salt and more vitamin E to preserve your soups?<br />I hope so!  And will be looking forward eagerly to the day when<br />you do!  Thanks!

review/text: My 22-year old son introduced us to this tea, which is quite refreshing. This powdered version has several virtues over the prepared version. It is much less expensive. It keeps much longer. My son says the taste is equal to or better than the prepared version (he makes it a bit stronger), and I like being able to make it a little weaker and less sweet. It mixes very easily with no powder remaining.

review/summary: Try it once...
review/text: I admit I'm a coffee snob. It's my one vice. I fell in love with coffee when I went to Venice. I found a little coffee shop on the Grand Canal. I knew that moment with its aromas and sights would be locked into my spirit as a rite of passage in a sense. Unfortunately back in the states I discovered another world. Most of the coffees here tasted like something that was scraped off the pavement at Jiffy Lube. Eventually, after much research I found a couple of great brands, bought my own espresso machine and we lived happily ever after.<br /><br />One day I read an article on Weaver's. It sounded good. Since I'm a happy member of Amazon Prime, I decided to give it a try. It is amazing. Even the subtle caramel flavor and scent is rich and soothing. It's like finding a new close friend to share those moments in the sun with.<br /><br />Let's face it: good coffee is like a good friend, but great coffee is like a soul mate. This is that coffee.

No caramel notes, no sweetness.<br />Taste: Mild, earthy, somewhat smokey, dirty mouth feel, finish is short.<br /><br />I mostly brew with a french press but i tried it in my espresso maker just to see how it would fair.  The caffeine seemed very pronounced to me, there was no sweetness to speak of.  It did have a very nice crema though.<br />Overall: I wont be buying this again, its nothing special.

review/text: I recently discovered buying coffee on Amazon and have fallen in love with the convenience.  I decided to try this based on the rave reviews.  Wish I wouldn't have listened.  Not nearly as good as I expected.  Note that it doesn't taste bad, it's just that it doesn't have much taste at all.<br /><br />Also disappointed in the packaging.  The companies seal on the coffee is a joke and the coffee was all over my Amazon box when it showed up.  This could be another reason the coffee did not taste very fresh since it was not air tight.  Will continue to search other coffees on Amazon.

review/text: I have been drinking this coffee since I learned that it won a national (televised) competition for best tasting coffee in its category (organic).  I can't drink any other coffee now because all the others taste terrible compared to Weavers. Try this...grab a handful of whatever whole been coffee you drink in one hand.  Hold a handful of Weaver's whole been coffee in the other.  Look at the size of the beans.  Now notice the texture and smell of the  beans.  You don't even have to taste them to see that it is a high quality product.<br /><br />I used to order this coffee directly from Weaver's website until I found it here on Amazon.  I was worried that it would not be as fresh as the coffee ordered directly from Weavers but Amazon sells so much of it, that it never sits around for long before being shipped out. It also arrives much faster via Amazon.<br /><br />I can't think of anything bad to say about it.  It is a little more expensive than standard coffee but not much.  After you taste it, you won't mind the price.<br /><br />God bless Amazon, UPS, and Weavers.

review/summary: Very good coffee
review/text: I got this coffee based on the reviews and fair trade category.  My husband is a big coffee snob (he used to roast his own beans, and uses a burr grinder and french press only) and we both enjoyed this coffee.  We live in Europe and have been using Lavazza Qualita Oro whole beans without complaint and I figured I would give these a try due to the reviews and origin.  The flavor is full bodied and rich with a chocolate depth to it that I really like.  When we ran out we went back to the Lavazza and upon our first cup we immediately noticed the bitterness and lack of character and were sold on the Weavers and I am now putting in my order!

review/text: My plan had been to order large bags to save a little money, but I'm so glad I ordered Weavers!  You'll notice when you open the bag how heavenly the strong, sweet aroma is.  It does fill the room and it'll waft into your bedroom all night if you grind and prepare it on a timer the night before. I know, you may think it a sin to grind early, but that convenience doesn't curtail your pleasure with Weaver's.  The taste! It's delightfully rich and full.  I can't YET speak for consistency.

review/text: I fell for the hype and gave it a try. I agree it has the caramel hints, which I guess is just not for me because caramel is a tad salty, and I loathe that briney taste at the back of my tongue when drinking coffee. I'm OK being very subtly reminded of dark chocolate, but no other flavors appeal to me when it comes to coffee.  I'm going back to my favorite, Cafe Altura Biodynamic organic French roast, which is the closest I've found to the rich, deep, bold coffee I've had in Paris.  I've also had good luck with the San Francisco dark roast I used to find at Costco.  Other great dark roasts I've found include Black Swan (Woodinville, WA) and Hailey Coffee Company (Hailey, ID)

review/text: Hmmm, where to start.  It's a really, really good cup of coffee.  It definitely deserves 5 stars, no doubt, happy to drink it, would be proud to serve it to my guests.  Perhaps best called caramel finish, not sweet caramel finish - might need a little turbinado sugar to get the sweet part.<br /><br />I do not think it is better than the Cafe Altura Dark Roast Columbian sold by Amazon in 32oz bags.  I would consider them equals, but the Weaver's is not better, and you get more coffe for less money with the Cafe Altura.<br /><br />I'm sure being called the "Best Organic Coffee" on the NBC TODAY Show was a good shot in the arm for sales, but I sincerely doubt that they are "the new standard in artisan coffee."  I think of coffee like Italian restaurants in New York/ New Jersey.  The great ones have endured, and everybody knows where to go for great Italian food.  But, when everybody is making the same stuff really well, what you're left with is your personal preference.  Weaver's is lucky to have some devoted coffee drinkers, but they're not a new standard by any stretch of the imagination, way too many people growing & roasting great coffee for that.

review/text: This tea is an excellent herbal tea. Love the taste and it's not as weak as most herbal tea is. I used to get it from the Commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so I checked on Amazon. Most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and I swear it said "and free shipping when ordered from this seller" above the "add to cart" button. I ordered last night and opened my e-mail this afternoon to find they charged me $8.49 shipping for each of the 3 boxes I ordered! And the estimated arrival time is a week away! For that kind of money I'd expect overnight. For that kind of money I could have gotten a couple cases and had change. It's probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products.

review/summary: Amazon Regular
review/text: My dogs have been enjoying these treats for years and we've ordered this many times from Amazon in the past.  However, our last order was a big disappointment.  The description of exactly how much of this product you will receive is very unclear, so when I saw that the product weight is 4.2 lbs and the shipping weight is 4.6 lbs., naturally I expected to receive a minimum of three one pound bags (as we have in the past).  Not so.  Amazon outrageously charged us $41.00 for a single one pound bag of dried lamb lungs.  You'd think I was buying caviar!  The treats were promptly packed back up and returned.  Tsk, tsk, tsk, Amazon :(<br /><br />So, 5 stars for the product itself.  0 stars for Amazon this time.

review/summary: Agility and obedience training treats
review/text: I ordered the Merrick lamb lung treats on the advice of a dog agility friend who had great success with them.  My dog has been blowing her contacts in agility trials, and my friend suggested using these special treats ONLY when training the dog walk, A-frame, table, and see-saw.  After just two training sessions, my dog is once again racing to the contacts and sticking them.  My fingers are crossed that this behavior will carry over to the trials, but with the help of a clicker and these apparently very appealing treats, I'm seeing renewed confidence and enthusiasm.  They're expensive, but are a bargain compared to the wasted trial entry fees and travel costs.  I'm also going to use them as I begin very basic obedience training with our new rescue dog.

review/summary: Amazing treats for obedience training and snacks
review/text: These treats are the BEST for training, whether its obedience or agility. They were recommended to me from my dog trainer after learning she used them while conducting obedience training with my pups. They can easily break down into smaller bite-size pieces which is great for constantly rewarding good behavior (without overindulging or making them chew) during training. They are also great treats to be used as a small snack for your dog. I highly recommend them!!! My dogs will listen to anything I say when I have these in my hand.

review/text: My two dachshunds are nuts about these lamb lung treats.  And I must say that, overall, they are MY favorite dog treats too, because ..... a one pound bag lasts a VERY long time and therefore is very economical, the pieces are easy to break up into any size you need for training, they are a natural lamb <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N62EKK">Merrick Lamb Texas Hold' Ems, 1 lb bag</a>product with a genuine aroma of roast lamb, the dogs NEVER get tired of them, you can carry pieces in your pocket and they won't stink or fall apart (but the dogs sure know they're there!). For my dogs, they are the most motivating commercial treat I've found.  What's not to like?

review/summary: My Rottweiler loves these
review/text: Been looking for a treat for my rottie that she would like but would also help her reudce her out-of-control milkbone habit and be less caloric. These fit the bill well. My only complaint is that they sometimes arrive pretty broken up into small pieces. However avoid purchasng from White Dog Bone (very slow and poor customer service). The provider seems to vary with Amazon.<br /><br />UPDATE: Tip from my vet - frozen cauliflower - has the crunchiness of milkbones that dogs love and few calories. Surpisingly, my dog is quite satisfied, but then she been eating asparagus, carrots, and green beans for dinner with roasted chicken msot nights for several years. Likes strawberries and peaches too! SHe;'ll still get some milk bones and these Texas Hold Em's but if cauliflower can helpo her lose some weight we'll push that more (and its cheaper!)

review/summary: Fake Colored Crystals!
review/text: I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice.

review/text: I love this sugar.  I've been using it, packaged in envelopes, for a year or two for everything.  Gives a great homemade taste to cookies.  And packaged in envelopes - see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZK7C">Sugar in the Raw Raw Sugar, 24-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> - it's wonderful stuff.<br /><br />But not in this packaging.  If you don't use the whole 12 pounds right away, the boxes of sugar turn hard as a rock.  Have to microwave them, pound them with a hammer, and then pour the sugar into a plastic envelope with a sugar bear - e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UKOWFC">JBK Bear Terra Cotta Brown Sugar Saver</a> - to make it possible to use it.  Definitely not worth it.  Buy it packaged in bags or not at all.

review/summary: Mmm... Banana!
review/text: While they aren't my favorite fruits, I do enjoy bananas and I keep them on hand because I love to add them to my smoothies (I usually add a heaping teaspoon or two of Matcha to all my smoothies too).<br /><br />This matcha has a delicious banana-y flavor that isn't too sweet.  The sweetness is from the fruit flavor and the Matcha itself, but it doesn't taste candy sweet, at least, not to me ... although it does smell like banana candy when you first open the package and all the while during preparation.  But, I don't get that sort of taste from the Matcha and that's a good thing, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />The matcha does taste a little different with the banana flavoring.  The normal vegetative tones of the matcha meld with the flavor of the banana ... the fruity notes of the banana ... in such a way that the vegetal notes seem to disappear and become more fruity.  The lovely, creamy, buttery tones are still there, and it still tastes like Matcha... but it's not veggie or grassy tasting like some Matcha can taste.<br /><br />I like!

review/summary: Do you Remember Circus Peanuts??
review/text: This is one of those matcha that you will want to have around for the kids, their friends, and when you want to make smoothies, or have a sweet treat. Its not my favorite from Red Leaf but its not bad at all it just reminds me of circus peanuts. Do you remember those things? Sort of like slightly hardened dried out marshmallow like candies. We used to get them at the dime store. Remember when we had "dime stores" ... haha anyway I do enjoy this tea - takes me back to the good ol days, and really where they all THAT good? Oh well the point is - this is some good stuff and I do like it but its more of a banana candy like flavor rather than fresh ripe banana but at the same time I just don't know how natural of a banana flavor one could possibly get - I don't know if I have ever had a better banana flavor in a tea or anything else for that matter that was not a banana itself. I think that banana flavored things always tend to have that slightly strange flavor to it.<br />Now, this is where things get really good ... I mixed my banana matcha with macadamia nut matcha to make a banana nut like matcha and it was excellent! Made a smoothie out of it that way too! It was QUITE yummy!

review/summary: Good prunes, but what's with the price here? Error?
review/text: I made prunes a permanent part of my diet because (a) they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants, and (b) because they're very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings. They're also supposed to be good, um, um, against constipation, so be careful. I usually eat a couple at a time, and never more than four; never a problem within these limits. They're nice to add to oatmeal too, along with bananas and raisins (or instead of raisins). Raisins are also a good antioxidant, in fact, second best after prunes, about half as strong.<br /><br />I've tried many kinds of prunes and so far Sunsweet are the best: I like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (I do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises.<br /><br />I buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. This page wants thirty? Well, this must be some sort of error... I expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what I can get locally. So, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. In fact, I got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. Be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. Avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and  next month will jack up the price by 50%. It's a racket, so stay clear.<br /><br />PS. Just discovered: Trader Joe's carries pitted prunes too: a resealable plastic bag holds one pound (16 oz) and costs two-eighty-nine. That's about one tenth of what this guy above wants. Bemuzing, to say the least.

We live in an area with lots of Hispanic markets and a sea of spicy sauces and foods available, but not Marie Sharp's. It's wonderful: "heat with a little sweet". Made in and exported by the tiny country of Belize, I recommend you give it a try. Amazon usually has special deals when ordering several bottles at a time.

review/text: If you have yet to try rooibos tea you are in for a treat. This smooth delicious tea is excellent any time of the day. I like that rooibos is naturally caffeine free so I can drink it late at night and not worry about staying up all night. I used to drink rooibos when I lived in Africa so this brings back fond memories. What I like most about this tea, besides the flavor, is that this is organic and the company supports fair trade practices. So you can really feel good about drinking a cup of tea from a company that is making the world a better place. This tea is also rich in antioxidants and contains calcium. Some parents make this tea for their children when they have colic (use it like water in baby formula). It is a good natural remedy. This tea does taste best with milk and I add stevia too although it is also served with lemon and honey.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Perfect light lunch!
review/text: I saw these on sale at a local store and only bought one because I wasn't sure I'd like them. Wrong! They were GREAT and I loved them! Couldn't wait to get more. The portion could be small for some, but for me it isn't. And only 80 calories for all of it? I could not believe that. The tuna salad is slightly sweet with some little veggie chunks in it, really creamy, too. The can opens easy (like a foil on top) and the salad seems to match up to the 6 crackers nicely! I need to get more, only have 3 left! I highly recommend these, but I do know stuff like this is a taste preference, but I am very happy!

review/summary: Great value, great flavor
review/text: I've purchased 1# bags of dried porcini previously from a very expensive gourmet food purveyor in NYC.  I tried this product - the price was a bit lower, but the shipping was MUCH lower.  The dried porcini are as good, if not better than from the expensive place.  They arrived promptly and were packaged well.  I immediately put about a third of them into an airtight glass jar on my counter. Packaged the rest up in a doubled freezer bag and put them in the freezer.  They keep well for over a year.  The pieces are large, sliced well, clean and bright.  The aroma is beautiful.  Tossed some into a pot of braised lamb shanks the day they arrived - fabulous...

A mild lemon flavor, not overpowering at all.  Each piece is individually wrapped and arrived unbroken and perfect.  I would recommend this for anyone.  And, best of all, made in the USA.

review/summary: Good fruit
review/text: Not Blenheims (the gold standard in apricots :) but I have had far worse than these. The fruits are pleasantly tart sweet and have good nutritional value (vitamin A) compared to canned peaches (which are still a favorite). One or two cans were delivered with a small dent but the apricots themselves are unblemished. I am sorry the other reviewer seems to have had such a bad experience but I can honestly say that mine were not salty. And the can indicates that no salt has been added. Perhaps it was the potassium in the skins but I think they help intensify the apricot flavors of the pear juice. In short, these are all "natural" i.e. no added sugar or corn syrup which is a plus for me. A good item to have on hand for quick healthy desserts either plain or with a sprinkling of granola and a scoop of a fav sorbet/sherbet/ice cream.

review/text: I almost didn't order these because of the bad review. . .only one can was really dented, and I opened that first.  No damage at all to the contents, and the flavor wasn't salty.  The apricots are tangy, the skin is a bit leathery just like fresh apricots, and the cans are quite full, not just juice with a few fruits floating around.  I was very happy with the product and would order again.  These are delicious for a quick dessert right out of the fridge, but would make a nice cobbler, too.

review/summary: 3 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

review/summary: Misleading
review/text: Unfortunately, all package size descriptions on the product page are wrong.  These are not 1.25oz packages and they are also not 1oz packages (as stated further down in the description).  They are .08oz packages.  Very disappointed in this fact.  Cherryheads are tasty, though, and the shipping was fast.

review/summary: good quality & flavor
review/text: I am happy with my purchase. The mushrooms are mostly whole and have a quality shroomy smell to them (not old and dusty in other words).
