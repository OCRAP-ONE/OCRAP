review/text: I used to eat Lifesaver hard candy a long time ago, couldn't get enough of it. It's not popular now, not sure why. But they used to be very popular. Now you can get Lifesaver gummies. I think they have a much better texture than Haribo or Black Forest, the two gummies you usually find in stores, much softer and little bit more tasty. Of course all this is subjective but for me, I can't get enough of these; the main problem is knowing when to stop.

review/text: I really, really, really like pecans. These are very good, but I wouldn't say they taste like pecan pie.  The taste reminds me of the crunchy pecan topping on my sweet potato casserole recipe. That topping is made with brown sugar, flour and butter. I find it hard to stop eating these. I eat them for a snack, take a few, take a few more, and a few more...and then have to put the bag in a hard-to-reach spot so I don't keep eating them.<br /><br />See the above "Important Information" for the ingredient list & "Nutrition Facts."

review/summary: Really good price for something not available in my stores.
review/text: These are small bags (2.5 oz. each) but there are 12 of them so that gives you 30 oz. of glazed pecans at a good price.  (At least the price was very good when I ordered them at under $18.) The flavor is also good, not exactly pecan-pie flavor, but it's a tasty glazed coating that adds pop to cookies or brownies.<br /><br />I like to add glazed nuts to my baked goods because they have more crunch than the regular nut would.  However, since the glazed nuts are sweet, it's probably a good idea to reduce the amount of sugar in your cookie recipe, unless you like your snacks very sweet.<br /><br />I would have given this product 5 stars but this particular batch of nuts I received was not quite as crunchy as I like.  When I added them to some chocolate chip cookies they added a chewiness level to them rather than a crunchiness.  Taste was excellent, however. Hope that was just a fluke and that when I need to order more, the next order will be a bit crunchier.

review/text: I love this miso, it is so much more versatile than the darker misos, like Genmai or Mugi. I purchased it initially just for miso soup, and just the broth soup tastes great even without the addition of any vegetables or extras. However, I noticed that another reviewer for miso (perhaps this type, or another) stated that they used the paste as a base for soups, stews, etc. I have a favorite chicken and wild rice soup recipe that I love, but it always seemed to be missing something. Last night I made that recipe again, and when it was done, added 2 tablespoons of the miso to the soup; I've found what I've been missing! Sometimes when you buy soup at restaurants, it has that added taste (umami) that you can't quite place or replicate at home. This Shiro miso gave me that taste that I can't quite ever put my finger on! This stuff is excellent, I highly recommend it to anyone. Mild taste, great addition to other recipes.

review/text: Though I mostly prefer the stronger, funkier <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019JRIPG">Genmai Miso</a> (also GF) I like to have this one around for applications where the genmai is too assertive.<br /><br />Tasting: straight-up this is a bright, sweet and nutty miso with just enough funk to add depth of flavor. The funk reminds me of cheddar toward the finish.<br /><br />I like it in a simple veggie broth (though adding kombu to the broth would kick it up a notch), sometimes with fresh veggies a la ph&oacute;, sometimes straight up, like a lot of simple soups the only limitation is imagination. Like so many fermented products a little miso just makes a body feel good.

review/text: This paste not only tastes GREAT, but it also keeps for ever in the refrigerator. I have had one opened pack in there for six months and it's still good.  Use it in macrobiotic cookery or just to add a nice flavor to grains. I ordered it in bulk and use it sparingly, it's so strong tasting.  Adds a delicious sweetish honeyish taste to brown rice and fermented food is super good for our digestive system.  Nice pack that has zip seal, plus inside pack.

This of course<br />adds flavor but it's not healthy. Best flavor is from properly prepared miso with a good Dashi and the freshest organic vegetables. Can add a little soy or tamari sauce for flavor too!

review/summary: Miso Soup
review/text: I have not purchased Miso from Eden yet, but Eden makes high quality products and I have never been disappointed. This is just to clear up the comment made about this making a 'flavorless' miso soup, because I believe it is user error, and not this product that was the culprit.<br /><br />If you want Miso soup like you get in the restaurants, you have to make your own Dashi (a Japanese soup broth). Then you use this Dashi as the base of your miso soup instead of water and you will get a very flavorful soup. Making dashi is easy. All you have to do is bring Kombu (dried kelp) and bonito flakes to a boil, simmer lightly, then strain the flakes and kombu from the resulting broth.<br /><br />Use this broth in place of water for your soup by following directions on the package and you will be good to go!

review/summary: Question about this product
review/text: I was delighted to find a Science Diet product that was Adult, Light, and Small Bite all at the same time. I have two dachshunds and want to feed them a lower calorie kibble in small bites, and this seemed perfect. But unlike the regular bite Science Diet adult, which is clearly marked "Light," there is nothing on this Small Bite package that indicates that this is the reduced calorie, "light" adult small bite kibble for dogs. Is there some mistake in the advertisement of this product. I ask because I would like to switch to a Science Diet Adult Light Small Bite kibble for my aging dogs (they turned 8 this summer) but it's not clear that this product is it.<br /><br />I should mention that I've been very happy with Science Diet, which has kept my dogs in nearly perfect health for all this time.

review/text: Got a Keurig for Christmas, and have spent the past two months trying to find great coffee that is also affordable.  Over a dollar each for the ones that I was getting at the grocery store was just not cutting it for me.  I purchased a reusable K-cup.  Couldn't stomach the weak coffee it made, and that was with superfine ground coffee.  Not to mention that it often only brewed half a cup.  So, after trying many different types, I decided I liked the taste of the Starbucks Sumatra the best, but it was way too expensive.  Come to find out, Green Mountain makes the Starbucks K-cups.  So I decided to try Green Mountain, as it is MUCH more affordable.<br />It's GREAT!  Nice, strong, flavorful cup of coffee!  FINALLY!

review/text: Got a Keurig for Christmas, so I've been having fun trying the wide variety of available K-Cup products.  So far, this is my favorite of all the coffees, and one of the few I'd stack up against a good cup of freshly ground and brewed regular coffee. Usually I like K-Cups because they're convenient.  I like these because they're truly excellent coffee and taste wonderful.  These and Coffee People's extra bold varieties are good enough to pass for the real thing - no one would ever suspect they were K-Cups if you didn't tell them.

review/text: Green Mountain Double Black Coffee "cups" are still the greatest cup of coffee.  Discovered it when I  purchased it from Amazon after purchasing a one cup keurig pot. Can't be beat if you want to start each day with a "hop, skip and a jump!"<br />Try it - you'll like it....and that's a guarantee!

review/text: Finally a good strong cup of coffee.  After drinking weak, flavorless K-cups I found this one.  It has a very strong, smooth, almost floral taste with no weird afertaste like some bold coffee.  I highly recomend this coffee especially if you are a true coffee junkie.  Trust me you will love it!

review/text: I like this brand. I didn't realize I was ordering extra bold. To me these T cups are bitter. Since I can't control the strength, I make a small cup and toss. Then I make a large cup to drink. It is still strong which I like, but still has a bit of bitter aftertaste. I still like this brand.

review/text: I put cream and sugar in my coffee, but I like one with bold flavor that shines through. I have tried other extra bold k-cups and come back to this one. Great taste, bold but not bitter. I only wish that the green mountain coffee would be offered as a subscribe and save item. Now that they are selling k-cups at Costco, I am tempted regularly to move to the lines they carry. It would be nice not to worry about running out, and to be rewarded a bit for my loyalty!

review/text: Let me start by saying I like French roast, pressed coffee. I was purchasing 1 lb. S***bucks French roast and having it ground for the press weekly. This coffee, GM Double Black Diamond (k-cup) and Gevalia Dark Italian Roast (Tassimo)come so close I do not purchase the ground coffee any longer. Very strong, full bodied coffee without being bitter or having an aftertaste. If you like strong, fresh coffee this is it.

review/summary: Strong but not bitter
review/text: I make my coffee like an ersatz latte and need a very robust coffee to pull that off---this fits the bill.  This is my method:  using a large mug, I first pour in about 1/4 c. of milk and nuke that for 60 seconds.  I then use either the small or medium (depends on my mood) Keurig setting and brew the coffee with the scalded milk, then top with a dollop of Bailey's coffee creamer.  Delicious!  I like a strong coffee but not a bitter one and Double Black Diamond works beautifully.

review/summary: If you like a dark and toasty big mug with just one K-cup, this will do it.
review/text: I have real issues trying to find a K-cup that will give me a robust-tasting enough mug of joe. For a while, I'd found near-perfection in the Coffee People extra bold mix... especially the Wake-Up Call (which got horribly expensive all of a sudden), but even those I only made on the middle setting of our brewer, and never the largest.  The Double Black Diamond still satisfied me on the largest setting, and has an intense, smoky dark edge that reminds me of the coffee that first converted me to the Pacific Northwest style of espresso---one I had a a tiny, roadside espresso stand out in the middle of nowhere between Tumalo and Sisters, in Oregon.  (It's probably not there any more--this was back in the 90s. LOL)  Anyway, it's definitely robust, and as I use milk/creamer, I don't find it bitter at all, but rich and worthy of savoring.  It will stand up nicely to a shot of your favorite flavor, and even shines through getting mixed with cocoa and vanilla for a toasty mocha.<br /><br />I just wish the coffees I'm finding out that I really, really like weren't shooting up into the "Can't Afford" ranges. But for those who love bold, smoky dark roast---this one is a real winner! I will keep it on hand for the times when I sit down with breakfast or with my Kindle to savor a cup of coffee rather than drink it in haste on the way out the door. But, if I find this coffee "loose" I'm getting it for my Eko-Brew reuseable K cups for sure.

review/summary: Nice Bold Flavor
review/text: I have been searching for a nice strong coffee for my Keurig that doesn't leave a bitter or flat aftertaste.  This a very nice bold flavored coffee that seems to fit the bill.  I am a bit spoiled after tasting Barista Prima's Italian roast as it has such a nice rich full-bodied flavor.  It is a bit pricier so the Double Black Diamond is a nice close second at a more affordable price.  I like my coffee black or with a little milk and this does not leave you wondering where the coffee went!

review/summary: Looking for a replacement for Starbucks and Tassimo? This is it.
review/text: I have been drinking Starbucks brand coffee with my Tassimo brand machines for years.  It was the perfect combination for me.  Now that they have stopped making Starbucks inserts I was forced to look for an alternative.  I bought a K-cup machine because it appears to be the dominant brand on the market.  This coffee is actually better than the original Starbucks!  I will not go back to the Starbucks brand even if they start making it for the K-cup machines.

review/summary: WOW - Wake up!!
review/text: WOW again!  This coffee is quite strong.  My husband and I drink our coffee black, and I usually drink 2-3 cups per day.  But this coffee is almost like drinking expresso. If you are looking for a dark, rich, very strong coffee, this one's for you.  Those who add sweetener and cream might also enjoy this wake up coffee.  Double Black.... perfect name.  However, I can only drink one cup a day of this brand.

review/summary: Outstandingly good
review/text: Tried a lot of different k-cups in search for a bold, expresso type of coffee. This one fits the bill all right. Strong but not bitter. Am able to make a large and medium cup out of one k-cup. Truly worth a few cents more per cup. Would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants a "real"" cup of coffee.

review/summary: Tastes like a real cup of coffee
review/text: Double Black Diamond Kcups are the nearest I have found to the Starbucks Tassimos Pods that are no longer available (maybe even a little stronger). If you like strong coffee that tastes like you spent $3, get these bad boys! If you like watered down, mild coffee I would stay away.

review/text: The Green Mountain Double Black Diamond Coffee is smooth even though quite strong. I run one cup  through my Keureg Brewer twice, first 10 oz then 6 oz. The coffee is strong enough to do this and it fills my largest mug and the coffee is then "just right" for me.

review/summary: a strong, bold cup of coffee
review/text: I like a strong, bold, dark roast coffee and Double Black Diamond is my current favorite.  If you like a medium roast coffee this isn't for you, but if you like 'Black Tiger Amazon' or 'Jet Fuel', you should try Double Black Diamond.  It will also stand up to a larger cup size for those of you that can brew them.  I usually brew it on my Keurig's 9.25 oz. size and it still makes a satisfying cup.

review/summary: If You Like Bold Coffee, This Is It!
review/text: My only hesitation in purchasing a K-Cup Brewer was whether the coffee would be bold enough for me. Since purchasing my brewer, I've tried many varieties and Double Black Diamond is my favorite. I drink my coffee black so I don't like weak coffee - I want it to be bold and smooth, not bitter. Black Diamond will not disappoint if you like good coffee. My other favorites are Green Mountain Expresso Blend and Coffee People Jet Fuel. I love my Cuisinart K-Cup Brewer - easy to use and no clean-up. I can make just one cup of fresh coffee whenever I want and don't end up throwing away unused or old coffee. And happily, I've found Double Black Diamond to start my mornings!

review/summary: Green Mountain Double Black Diamond Coffee
review/text: I like coffee....no, i like BLACK STRONG COFFEE. I was hesatant on getting this but thought what the heck. I was tired of picking up a limited supply of k-cups from the Discount Department Stores and having them taste a little weak. From the beginning, when your cup starts to brew, you can tell "this is going to be a GOOD cup of coffee". I wasn't disappointed. Great stuff. My wife drinks it more than I do but get it....you wont be let down at all, especially if you like just coffee....in your coffee.

review/summary: One of my favorite flavors!
review/text: I love my coffee strong and black, but I don't like the harsh and sometimes burned flavors that many extra-bold K-cups have.  Double Black Diamond is the perfect blend for me; I actually hoard my supply in my house.  The flavor is more intense than many others while still maintaining balance.  Not for the faint-of-heart, this blend approached but stops short of espresso strength.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

review/summary: Does The Job
review/text: Jolt-wise, this is a nice, gentle introduction to Extra Bold. (Darker roast, therefore less caffeine than most XB's.) The taste is charcoal, with charcoal notes and a charcoal finish.  I have a sweet tooth and tend to prefer the sweeter, smoother coffees.  However, I occasionally have a Double Black Diamond because it wakes me up without making me jittery.
