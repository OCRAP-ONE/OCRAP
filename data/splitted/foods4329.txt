review/summary: One lump or two?
review/text: These sugard cubes and indeed white and made of sugar, but I can only interpret "European-Style" and "cubes" to be a contradiction in terms. These cubes are not, in fact, remotely cube like. I would not recommend them for display purposes for the the construction of small, delicious igloos. I would, however, recommend them for insertion into cups of tea and any other foodstuffs that needs sweetened up sharply and without remorse. Make no mistake: these things are pure sugar and are absolutely effective at their stated goal: sweetening up the world.

review/summary: Disappointing...and now I've got A LOT of 'em
review/text: While I've never purchased straw mushrooms before, I knew I'd had them in restaurants and liked them fine.  I had an idea I'd be using these in stir fries or other simliar dishes.  Nonetheless I like to try things plain first to see what it is I'm getting.  These are, as most canned vegetables are, stored in highly salted water, so I rinsed and tried one.  Eeewww.  The label information describes them as "subtly flavored." Yeahhhh, we could say that.  Or we could say "bland and chewy, with a mass-produced flavor."  To be fair to these mushrooms and give them a fighting chance, I then sauted some in olive oil with a bit of soy sauce.  They remained chewy and uninteresting.  I cut them into pieces hoping that would allow them to absorb more flavor but that didn't exactly work either.  Let's say the caps are better than the stems so far as flavor.  These just weren't worth keeping and forcing myself to eat. Maybe others know some magical way to prepare them that I don't, but I'm giving up.

review/summary: its a korean staple!
review/text: being half korean i cant live wthout this stuff. great for marinades , soup, whatever :). if you're using it more like a dip for cucumber spears make sure to add some soy sauce, seasame oil and seasame seeds to thin it out otherwise its too gummy. the paste is also great for rice and lettuce wraps! I get mine at the korean store/asian market. worth the extra and maybe awkward feeling trip but they are so used to any and everyone coming in that store that if anyone feels odd it will only be you. only drawback on this product thru amazon is the price. good lord! wouldnt pay 1/2 the price in a store.  there are different types of paste so make sure youre getting this one!

review/summary: Excellent product--but be aware of shipping issues.
review/text: The product itself is excellent. Good quality and great taste.<br /><br />Beware------>If you live in a warm climate or have this item shipped in the hottest months, the cookies will most likely arrive fused together because the chocolate coating melts while sitting in the delivery truck for even the shortest amount of time. Having them sent overnight, next-day delivery can help reduce this risk, but if the delivery arrives late in the day, or sits outside your door for a while, odds are you will have a fused block of degestive cookies. The first time I orderd them I had them shipped ground...needless to say a bad choice. Second time was overnight, they arrived slightly melted but not fused into a single, messy block.

review/summary: Cadbury Chocolate Digestive
review/text: These biscuits (cookies) are delicious. They are a wonderful combination of Cadbury's chocolate and a fresh tasting crispy wholemeal biscuit. They go well with tea or coffee. Highly recommended!<br /><br /> McVitie's is also a well respected maker of chocolate digestives that I would buy. In any case, regarldess of brand, I would suggest getting them whilst they are available. They'll probably be a seasonal item as they won't standup to shipping in warm/hot weather.<br /><br />I'm glad to see Amazon selling them directly instead of them being offered from an Amazon Marketplace supplier. Those outfits charge ridiculous shipping and handling fees. I only wish that Amazon would sell more British goods directly, although they do have quite a few products to choose from.

review/summary: Great but....
review/text: These taste great and arrived super fresh. I wasn't paying too close of attention when I ordered them, and I thought they were individually wrapped small packages of standard sized sour patch kids. They are in fact actually individually wrapped giant 6 gram sour patch kids - the size of swedish fish (see the photos I added). I don't mind the form factor, but there is one important caveat worth mentioning, the writing/graphics on the cellophane wrapper flake off onto your hands when you open them up. While normally this wouldn't be worth mentioning, it seems to flake off in glitter sized pieces, which do an excellent job of sticking to your hands (like glitter) and don't wash off easily. It's really not a big deal - but it does bear mentioning.

I love that they are individually wrapped so I can easily make sure each person gets a decent amount and also might have some left over for other holidays. Of course, they are so good that I might eat all the left overs before I get a chance to use them for anything else! The container is also great if you plan on having these somewhere people can just grab a few and go.

review/summary: Great in other foods but too sweet to drink alone
review/text: I'd recommend buying a carton in the store before purchasing a pack of 12. While I love mixing a tiny splash of Pacific Naturals's hemp milk into my hot cereal, it does have 16g of sugars. Compare this to Tempt's sweetened and unsweetened vanilla hemp milk, which has 9g and 0g, respectively (but unfortunately contains carrageenan). I can clearly taste the brown rice syrup in the milk, and thus cannot drink this straight-up or have it with cold cereal, in part because it's isn't very healthy to do so and in part because it would just be terrible going down. Everyone's tastebuds are different, so you might love this. But I'm glad I didn't buy in bulk. It's become my preferred sweetener for making hot cereal and hot chocolate (1/2 c. will do, with some raw cacao powder, and diluted with water), but I wouldn't want to have 11 cartons waiting to be used.

He'll drink the Vanilla but the scent is pervasive and seems to hang around all day.  I picked the original / plain from this brand because it has higher fat / protein than other milks.

review/text: This is the second time I've ordered this case of a dozen, 32-Ounce cartons of Pacific Natural Foods Hemp Milk.  The first time, the packaging was minimal and the product arrived quickly and perfectly.  This time the packaging was extraordinary:  The original box was tightly wrapped in thick bubble wrap and then placed in a larger box filled with more bubble wrap . . . to no avail.  Some, lightweight, brown-shirted clod with skinny arms and a weak back couldn't handle the weight of a dozen, 32-ounce cartons of liquid.  He, and perhaps a few of his compatriots, dropped this box hard enough to burst four of the dozen containers inside several layers of bubble wrap.  Amazing!

review/summary: Great for food allergies
review/text: We tried EVERYTHING for my daughter when she was diagnosed with a milk and soy allergy at 12 months. We gave her everything in the grocery store and she couldn't tolerate any of it. This milk acts every bit at hypoallergenic as the goat's milk (at least for my daughter who reacted to every other milk but goat's milk) but is much healthier. The hemp milk was recommended by my daughter's GI doctor and nutritionist b/c it has the most vitamins and minerals possible in a non cow's milk milk. Bonus- She loves the taste (we get vanilla)!<br /><br />I also love that you can order in bulk so its cheaper than at the grocery store and get a discount for signing up with the subscribe and save feature on Amazon. We have it set up to come every 2 months which is perfect for how much milk a 16 month old drinks. Best of all, it is shelf safe so it doesn't have to be stored in the fridge until we open it.<br /><br />This is a great alternative to cow's milk for those with allergies. This brand is a great value, has the most vitamins/calcium/iron of all the hemp milks and tastes great.

review/text: I have never before given a negative review to anything, but I am very sorry that I bought a full 12 pack of this.  I had previously used another brand and found it to be wonderful. I made the mistake of assuming that this product would be of equal quality.  Pacific Natural has a very thick consistency and exudes a strong chalky taste. Can't return the unopened 11 containers and will not drink them. I will buy living harvest brand in the future even though it costs more.

review/summary: The BEST Hemp Milk!
review/text: Pacific hemp milk is the best! It is so creamy and delicious.  I love heating the vanilla with cacao powder and dessicated coconut for hot chocolate in the colder months (sometimes I add a little agave, too).  This hemp milk is also so good mixed with Oregon Chai (liquid).  Pacific hemp milk can be tough to find!

I am aware of Amazon's strategic disclaimer about ingredients, but saying that something is Certified Organic and then shipping something that totally is NOT ORGANIC is sketchy. Please don't order this product if you are expecting organic.

review/text: Cute EXTREMELY TINY gift. You do not receive the gift in the picture. Don't expect the big cute ribbon and the tea cup in the rear, instead it is tied with a small gold ribbon. Everything is jammed into the tiny little wicker basket and the whole thing is approximately 8" by 5". I paid $24.99 for it and it is now listed at $29.99. In my opinion it is worth $15.00. If money is not an issue and you want a nice small gift, I would recommend this, but don't expect to get what is in the picture!

They will NOT eat any other brand of bully sticks after having these.<br /><br />Don't bother with the rest, get the best! These definitely have the best flavor according to them!  If you buy the 12 inch size, you can saw them in half too. These are great for dogs to chew on and until they are unbraided, you don't have to worry about any pieces for them to choke on.  I have never had any problems unlike the rawhide sticks.<br /><br />I'm so happy I found these. :-)

The peppermint flavor is just strong enough yet not too strong. I use orange blossom honey in all of my tea. This tastes like your drinking a candy cane. I've tried a couple other flavors of Tadin tea and this has to be my favorite. I'm not sure this would be good iced although I have not tried it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good flavored tea.

review/summary: Great Chai for Your Keurig Brewer
review/text: After reading the many reviews that users had posted about this tea, I wasn't sure what to expect when it arrived.  I brewed it and found that it had a pleasant aroma and a distinctly spicy taste.  As with other k-cup teas, I found that its taste was, in my opinion, not watered down at all.  Of course there could be endless reasons why this could be and so I am not saying that others will necessarily share my opinion.  What is certain, however, is that this chai tea is very flavorful and has a good blend of spice that stands out among the chai teas that I have tasted.  This would definitely not be a bad choice for those wishing to experience chai, or k-cup chai, for the first time.

review/summary: Weak Chai, But good.
review/text: I have a feeling the favorable reviews here are for Chai tea in general because honestly this Chai is not very good. Personally I don't like it, I prefer the Celestial Seasonings Chai which is closer to a Starbucks Chai latte. My wife however is not a fan of spicy things and this fits the bill. Its a very weak Chai, perhaps cinnamon is the overwhelming flavor however nothing about this Chai is overwhelming.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />If you love Chai from a coffee shop don't waste your money on Timothy's, grab a box a Celestial Seasonings Chai, it's more expensive but so much better.<br />If your a very casual Chai drinker, or always wished Chai wasn't so spicy then go ahead and get this brand.

review/summary: Pretty good chai
review/text: I like chai and I've had various coffee shop chais, and home-created versions with "grandma's spices from the old country" as well as the concentrate and powered kinds.  All in all, this one is pretty good.  Can't beat the convenience of the "one pod, one cup, brew right this minute" that the Keurig enables.  Buying through Amazon with Prime for free shipping makes the cost quite reasonable as well.  Is it the very best chai I've ever had?  No, that was one of those "grandma's spices" recipes.  This ranks up there as a pretty good (and FAST) alternative though.  I've ordered this several times and it's one of my K-Cup staples.

WHy would one customer say it's just like coffee house chai and other say it's not even tea. The reality is it isn't very Chai'ish. Weak and not very flavorfull. I think its impossible to extract true chai flavor without a very well made extract concentrate in each pod. I haven't found that in this or any of the other chai cups. Very dissapointed. Wish I could get my money back because I'm throwing them out. I'm a S-bucks Chai addict and no way does this even remotely come close. I'll stick to dumpong concentrate into breakfast tea.

review/text: My wife and I purchased a Keurig coffee maker a year ago. It's very convenient for us to make coffee one cup at a time and it only takes a few seconds to brew. In addition to using Timothy's Coffee, we also subscribe to their Chai Tea Cups. After seeing and using ours, each of our 6 children have purchased one and they love theirs as much as we do ours. Subscribing monthly to the coffee and bi-monthly to the tea with free shipping (Amazon Prime) it costs us about 30 cents a cup... well worth the price.

review/summary: Timothy's World Chai Tea
review/text: What I was expecting was a chai tea similar to one I find in popular coffee houses: a spiced tea infused with cream and sugar. This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Celestial, Bigelow and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test. The K-cup chais are simply not the same as the coffee house chais. To approximate the coffee house chai you'll need to add your own cream/milk and sugar/honey and give it a little shake.

review/text: I was surprised at the aroma and smoothness of this chai drink.  It was quite appealing, as are all of the flavored coffees that I drink from Timothy's, as their aromas fill the room with anticipation.  Moreover, the flavor is well-balanced for the size of the cup, almost pleasantly deceiving you with its departure from the stronger scent.  I highly recommend all of Timothy's products, as it is clear that is the company is run by those who have a passion for coffee and tea.  Note: I have no affiliation with Timothy's; I just [quite fortunately] discovered their products on amazon.

review/text: As a lover of Chai Tea I was pleased to see it offered for my Keurig brewer. I was disappointed in the flavour. I found it somewhat weak and the orange it includes was overpowering. I love Chai for the heady taste of middle eastern type spices, it is a true comfort "food" for me in the colder weather. It also is delicious over ice. I will seek out other brands of K-cups Chai though.

I love these things. But mainly because they're nipple-shaped.<br /><br />I need a girlfriend.

Thought they would be cheaper in bulk from amazon, but Trader Joe's is still cheaper per tin. If you don't have a Trader Joe's then definitely use amazon for these great mints. I like them much better than Altoids, and the sugar substitute in these mints don't leave a strange aftertaste.

review/text: This is definitely a nice everyday green tea, with almost no astringency and a buttery, nutty flavor. Both the dry leaf color and the infusion color are greener than most Chinese green teas, but otherwise it's pretty standard (in a good way).  I liked this one better than Rishi's Emerald Lily green tea, which is more expensive and pretty similar tasting overall.

review/text: Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but this is the worst green tea I have ever had. If I leave it steeping for the amount of time recommended on the container, it is tasteless. If I leave it to steep any longer than recommended, its bitter (of course). I have had A LOT of green tea and I have no idea why this one is like that. I have tried using it with the Breville Tea Maker and the regular way with a tea ball. I have not used it with any traditional tea pots (whether ceramic, cast iron, etc)- is this why it doesn't come out right I wonder....I would never recommend this tea.

review/text: Thank goodness for a wonderful combination:  Cloud Star Buddy Biscuits & Amazon.com!  I was overjoyed on the day I discovered I could purchase such a wonderful product like Cloud Star's Roasted Chicken Buddy Biscuits in a 6-pack from Amazon.com.  My 12-year-old red sesame Shiba Inu has been enjoying the regular-sized Roasted Chicken Buddy Biscuits for years.  As he has slowed down in his senior years, I've been challenged with curbing his insatiable appetite for the regular-sized Buddy Biscuits.  Cloud Star Itty Bitty Roasted Chicken Buddy Biscuits are the perfect solution!  These little 1-inch treats are great for playing games, for rewarding when cutting finger & toe nails, and for giving a treat when you'd prefer not to break a larger treat into pieces.  If you want to give your furry little child a wholesome & healthy treat, I strongly recommend Cloud Star's Buddy Biscuits in both sizes.

review/summary: not very flavorful
review/text: This product has the lentils in a separate packet and the rice loose.  It comes with a flavor pouch that includes spices and raisins.  Overall, it looked like it would have lots of flavor but it was actually very bland after cooking.  It made about 3 generous portions.  Cooking time says 20 minutes but was more like 40 to get everything cooked well.  I gave it 2 stars because it was edible, and was even somewhat good when covered with sour cream but: The main flavoring was whole peppercorns.  There was literally 1-3 peppercorns per fork full but the food didn't have a strong pepper flavor.  I don't like biting into whole peppercorns.  That may even crack a tooth!  My mother used to put a few whole peppercorns into soups and I hated it growing up because I would inevitably bite one and get a hot peppery explosion.  It's hard to enjoy food while anticipating an unpleasant pepper explosion.  So, I ended up going through my portion of this meal, picking out the peppercorns.  I ended up picking out about 50+ in 1/3 of the food!  This is why I gave the meal 2 stars.  Like I said, the meal was lacking flavor, even pepper, so I ended up putting some cracked pepper and salt on top after removing the peppercorns.  Goes fairly well with the recommended sour cream.

review/text: I am not yet a Gen Meicha coineisseur, but I do enjoy this blend. I think I like Taylor Maid better, its sweeter, or else its the way they make it at my favorite restaurant, in a French press.  At home, I strain through a tea strainer. Its got a gentle flavor and not as acidic on my stomach as other green teas bother me.  The roasted rice I think helps balance it out.  If I don't let it steep long enough its very weak, too long it can get a little tannic (or whatever that kick to it is).  I'll order it again for sure, I like the bulk over tea bags.
