review/summary: Jelly Belly vs. Heide Gummi Bears
review/text: Both Jelly Belly and Heide have established themselves as leaders in the American Gummi Bear market, in fact, Jelly Belly was the first to ever make an American Gummi Bear. Unlike their European counterparts, such as Haribo Gold Bears, American Gummi Bears are soft and have a more opaque look to them.<br /><br />My all-time favorite Gummi Bear has been Heide ever since elementary school, but I give Jelly Belly a lot of credit for putting up a great fight. Jelly Belly bears are smaller and less resembling of a bear, but they sure pack a punch in terms of flavor. Heide bears on the other hand are larger and more bear-like than their counterpart, but flavor is more subtle. Both come in five distinct flavors and both are difficult to find in your average grocery store candy aisle.<br /><br />On average, Jelly Belly bears appear to be more costly than Heide bears per ounce, but of course that doesn't mean you won't find amazing deals like the one on Amazon that turn the tables. In general you won't go wrong with either brand, but my vote still goes toward Heide for bringing back all the memories of my childhood.

review/summary: No maple - no crunch - disappointing
review/text: This particular flavor in the Coffee Bean Direct line is my least favorite.  I buy this brand often and usually find it to be quite good but this flavor seemed flat and practically non-existent.  I bought four bags in the offering I purchased and was disappointed with all four bags.  Not up to the brands usual grade.  I would not buy this again.

review/summary: Great Tasting Protein Bar
review/text: I like both the chocolate mint and the peanute butter, but my husband loves the chocolate mint.  They're convenient to carry for hiking and biking and easy to eat while walking on the treadmill.  Of all the protein bars I had looked at, Genisoy is highest in soy protein.  I was pleasantly surprised they taste so good.

review/summary: VERY impressive taste for a protein bar!
review/text: I can't say enough about this product, but I will try to keep it short!!<br /><br />I just got finished eating this Crispy Chocolate Mint GeniSoy bar, and it was delicious!!  Having tried many types of protein bars, I expected this one to have that well known "in your face protein" taste.  I personally didn't notice it at all.  It DID  ~smell~ as if it would taste this way, but I was pleastantly surprised to find out that it's smell didn't do it's taste justice!!  It has a great chocolate mint flavor,and the mint isn't too overpowering, it is nice and chewy, but not the stick to your teeth type.  I am eager to try the other flavors GeniSoy offers in their bars.  I hope they are as good as this one!!<br /><br />ENJOY!!!

review/text: These are pretty tasty bars.  My wife and I eat them just candy bars / dessert (240cal).  I've tried most of Genisoy's flavors, and this is by far my favorite.  (My wife thinks it's a tie between this chocolate mint and the peanut butter.)  The only thing keeping me from giving the fifth star is the price (not bad for the protein-bar market, but still I wish they were a bit less).

I used to cut the old bar in half<br />for a twice a day treat. The empty packaging could have been cut<br />by a third for the new bar. I like fats rather than sugar so the<br />food lasts longer than a sugar high.

review/text: I really like the taste of these chocolate mint bars.  I love chocolate and mint together and was so happy that Genisoy makes these.  If you are hoping these are a crunchy type bar due to the crispy part in the description, then you will not like them.  They have a gooey and firm consistency and the crispy part is throughout the bar.  They remind me of a really good fattening candy bar.  What a great way to get your protein and vitamins and not feel guilty.

Also, the bar contains 25% of your daily protein intake, which is great news if you are a vegetarian or, like me, simply prefer to get your protein from sources alternate to meat.<br /><br />I highly recommend the GeniSoy Protein Bar for college students. I keep it in my dorm for a healthy late night snack or in the morning on the go.

review/text: This is energy disguised as dessert.  I love chocolate (real chocolate, not carob) and mint.  Generally I'm nonplussed by energy and protein bars, but this one really surprised me.  I suffer from low energy and really get low on protein throughout the day.  I just took a few bites out of this bar several times a day and was good to go.  It also helped keep me away from sugary snack foods which is what I tend to eat when I get low on energy and protein.  This truly tastes like an indulgence.

Look at the calories per serving, a whopping 65. Most people would not understand the metric calorie decription on bottle- it says 65g per serving-than means 65 calories to us in the U.S. Also, you can buy Smucker's new Orchard marmalade-three fruit for 2.99 in stores. This only has 50 calories per serving and much better taste than this one. I read the reviews on this brand on Amazon- I do not know what the people were raving about Mrs Bridges. Pass on this one.

review/summary: Good for an OCCASIONAL breakfast on the go, beware of exp date
review/text: I used to eat these every morning for breakfast when I had a 1+ hour commute in upstate NY.  They are quick and easy to grab, but must be consumed with liquid.  I preferred a hot cup of coffee and a glass of water to wash everything down.  They would last me until lunch time, which was nice since I was always running from one campus to another.  I had always jsut purchased a box a week from the local grocery store.<br /><br />Be aware, however, if you buy in bulk from Amazon: we purchased two six box cases (72 breakfast squares), which for 2 people should last 36 work days.  If you factor in a few days where you actually have time to make breakfast or just want something different, these should last 1.5-2 months.  I don't mind buying things this far in advance, and it's never been an issue, but the expiration date of these bars did not fall within that 2 month range.  Now, most food products in packaging that I've had experience with are good past the exp date.  These, however, were soooo dry and made me want to eat them even less.  Whereas before you needed a cup of coffee, water or tea, now it was essential to dip the bar or take a bite and then immediately a swig of beverage even before chewing.

review/summary: Oatmeal To Go!
review/text: I love eating oatmeal, mixed with milk and some honey , occasionally just a dab of butter will do. But I cannot always cook a bowlful when I really need it, say at 3 in the afternoon in a freezing office. Its messy, and if you dont bring your bowl back to the kitchen immediately, youre gonna be left with hardened paste.<br /><br />I got these Quaker Oatmeal To Go in the Oatmeal Raisin flavor. They are really heavy and dense , kind of remind me of a homemade energy bar, or a snack you would find at a health food store. I have eaten them both cold and hot. Cold they are a bit gummy, chewy but still really tasty. Hot they are like a warm melty mitten in your tummy and twice as yummy as they are cold.<br /><br />These would make the perfect "on the go" breakfast for anyone, adults, kids, and teens. They are super filling and satisfying.

It was the inside packaging, not the bubble wrap and box the product was shipped in.  The honey company did not stand my their packaging when contacted.  They stated it was Amazon's problem.  Not so.  Never was resolved.  Therefore, I'm only giving it 3 stars.

review/summary: Baronet Coffee Izzy's Blend Medium Roast Pods
review/text: I purchased 3 boxes based on the 5-star reviews and am very disappointed in the quality. I have a Hamilton Beach pod coffee maker for work and when brewed the coffee looks like weak tea. I have to pour the coffee back in the coffee pot and brew again just to have a mediocre cup of coffee. Very disappointed in this brand and will not buy again.

review/summary: Not so good
review/text: I am not a person who fancies themselves a Coffee Diva or anything like that.  But I know a bad cup of coffee when I have one.  These pods are without a doubt the weakest pods on the market.  I've tried many many different varieties.  When I brewed my first one and looked into the cup - I thought to myself - Hmmm?  Did I just make hot TEA?  Figured perhaps it was a bad pod.  So... I gave another one a try.  Same thing - WEAK WEAK WEAK!  And the flavor isn't there to back up the weakness.  So.... I gave it another try - THIS TIME - with TWO pods.  Still insanely weak!  Basically - I threw them away.  Not even worth a desperate cold Sunday morning cup when there is nothing else in the house!!  Better to have milk!  Sorry folks!

review/summary: Good Coffee!
review/text: Pods are hard to come by these days, and I HATE Senseo coffee, but I found these pods online.  I've tried just about every brand and flavor of pods and wanted something different, so I ordered these.  This is very good coffee.  A little stronger than most pods, but not as strong as French roast.  It has a very unique flavor and aroma...almost like half hazelnut, half regular coffee.  The only downside is Amazon obviously ran over this shipment a couple of times with a forklift before it was put in a box and sent out to us (the box it was shipped in was in perfect shape, so it wasn't the post office's fault.)  I was very surprised almost all the pods were intact because the packaging they were in was a mess.  Time to take better care of your stuff, Amazon!

review/summary: Forget the Senseo Pods!
review/text: I own a Senseo machine and was using Senseo brand coffee for a full year before I found the Baronet coffees on Amazon. I buy this Izzy's and a decaf and they are delivered to me monthly at a price cheaper than the Senseo at Target (which is the cheapest I have found for the Senseo brand). The thing that really sells this for me is the amount of coffee per pod - much more than the other pods on the market. Not all Baronet pods are this super size...be sure to check the weight. There is a good 30% more coffee in these pods than the other brands, they are delivered to my front door and the flavor is wonderful!

review/summary: Whoah!
review/text: Whoah! After the senseo pods because unavailable in any stores I shop at, and getting weird backstock and supply issues from senseos site-ordering, I finally looked at amazon again after a long time, and I found these bad boys! I picked the "izzy blend" whatever thats supposed to be, based on the description of the coffee, and its PERFECT. The pods are all oversized, which means when in the single pod brew tray thing, makes an ample amount of really good, creamy coffee. Theyre also all individually wrapped in foil, each like a bulging condom in the wrapper. That keeps them amazingly fresh. This coffee is good, at least the ones I got, really good. When I brew this, people pop out of hiding spaces sniffing around and mutterring "coffee! coffee... coffeecoffee! that smells like coffee!" and it does. I love my senseo machine, despite the issues ive had with it, I prefer the idea of ground coffee still instead of weird magical coffee concentrates. I never expected coffee this good to come from that thing! I tried using the "reuseable pods" which didnt amount to anything but some watery, slightly foamy, weak dribble. That was with the eco, and the duck, and that other thing. I'm in love with my senseo machine again! If you want creamy coffee, that tastes like COFFEE, without being some kind of awful acid filled starbucks over-coffee, then go for this. Its simply a damn good mug of coffee that does its job when it literally opens my eyes and wakes me up in the morning. Would highly reccomend this to anyone, the coffee is just great, its packaged perfectly, and the oversized pods are something I still cant get over.<br /><br />Thug life homies, may your pencils never dull, your fridge always be full, and may there be plenty of ninjas to snipe in your dreams.<br />Good day.

review/summary: Best we have found
review/text: We love these Pods and use them in our Senseo coffee machine.  Senseco Pods are becoming more difficult to locate in retail stores.  The Baronet pods work well and are of better quality than Senseo.  However for the foil packed singles  you will need to use the 2 pod holder, or just mash it down well in the 1 pod holder IF you have a Senseo supreme  (chrome) machine. If you buy Baronet pods in the loose package they are the same size as Senseo pods but we prefer the foil as they stay fresher, just adjust the pod holder selection and brew volume as needed.<br /><br />Izzy blend is our favorite regular blend, and the Baronet decaf coffees actually taste like real coffee, imagine that! Our favorite decaf is 100% Columbian decaf medium roast.<br /><br />The Baronet 'medium' roast blends are plenty bold for us and close to the Senseo dark roasts but with much more flavor.  Like it strong...buy the dark full bodied Baronet line up.

review/text: I love these pods. They seem very rich and have good flavor. You don't want to go over 9 oz or you start loosing the flavor. I use the double holder In my cap maker. The single is just to tight to mess with. I also wet the pod first. These are bigger than other pods so by using the double holder, I don't think it takes anything away from the coffee. I also bought the Nutty Irishman. It is also a favorite.<br />Hope this helps. God bless.

review/text: This noon for lunch I had a box of Dr. McDougall's Garden Vegetable Soup (lower sodium variety. It was quite good. The box contained two servings and only 60 calories each.I consumed both servings. Plus, it had no fat and, of course, the sodium was low. It was a good tasting soup and, together with a couple other items, made a good nutritious lunch.<br /><br />I like to find items like this because I can store  them in my pantry and have a good meal prepared in no time at all. Plus, I worry about proper nutrition and so many of the things you can store are so high in salt, sugar and fat. Not here! This is a good item. I've also enjoyed their lentil soup and I'll probably test a few other kinds. You wouldn't think such good soups would come in a box.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Ones bought in USA taste different.
review/text: We also just got back from Mexico, having tried these.  They are DELICIOUS and really do, as one reviewer described, taste like the inside of a peanut butter cup.<br />As soon as we finished the Mexican box, we went to the local Mexican grocery store (in Tampa) and found them.  Upon tasting, my gf and I decided the ones bought in the US were much less "peanutty" and far more "vanilla tasting" than the ones from Mexico, although they were still good. Although all the labeling on the US version is the same on the candy itself, the plastic that holds (several of) the candies is in English and there is no actual print on the US version that says "Made In Mexico" that I can read.  The Mexican one does, of course, say "Made In Mexico".  I wonder if the ones sold to USA resisents are made with a different recipe to suit our tastes?  I like the Mexican version better.

review/summary: Peanut butter with your Powdered sugar
review/text: I read a review that stated that these taste like the inside of a peanut butter cup, only a little sweeter. They do not. They have the consistency of what you would find in a peanut butter cup, but not the taste. Another reviewer said these taste just like Mexican wedding cake cookies. This is actually the review that sold me on getting these. They do not taste like that either. I think the consistency is what sold these reviewers on the response that they give. I will admit that the consistency is fun, it's crumbly, and makes it seem more appealing, the flavor is in no way appealing to me.<br /><br />What these do taste like is a mix between powdered sugar and the faintest hint of peanut butter. The powdered sugar overwhelms this product and is not appealing to my taste buds. If you like eating powdered sugar than you will probably enjoy these. I am sure there is a market out there for these confections, I just would not purchase these again, nor can I recommend them.

With my experience, I received the product in a timely manner, delivered by UPS.  My complaint is this...their were broken shells in every taco dinner box I received.  The pricing was great, and it saved me some money on the product, but I think I would rather have unbroken shells when I try to use them.  So, I believe going to the local grocer or supermarket would be the best bet for future purchases.

review/summary: no hydrogenated oil!
review/text: I went to my local supermarket recently looking for some taco shells.  I picked up box after box of various brands/types and they were all loaded with trans fat.  Even when they claimed zero trans fat, partially hydrogenated oils were still listed in the ingredients.  And the ingredients lists were far too long for something so simple.  I finally picked up the Taco Bell shells and the ingredients were very simple: white corn, corn oil, water, yello 5 & annatto for color.  No partially hydrogenated anything.<br /><br />Unfortunately, by getting rid of the trans fats and other stuff, these shells are a little bland.  It doesn't matter much as long as you have tasty fillings, but a little salt might have helped.  There's only 5mg of sodium for 3 shells, so they're great for people watching their salt intake as well.  The shells hold up well.  I packed some in my lunchbox a couple of times with the fillings packed in small containers and the shells didn;t break.<br /><br />I'd give these 5 stars for being the healthiest choice, and 3 for taste, so 4 stars overall.<br /><br />I did not buy the kit, just the shells, but I've checked out the ingredients on the taco sauce and seasoning packet in the kit and no trans fat there either.

review/summary: Tasty chocolate with trace of goji berries
review/text: These confections are a very dark, bittersweet chocolate covering what probably really is a tidbit of goji berry.  They are enjoyable to eat as a candy although there is probably not enough goji berry in each to get much of the suposed health benefits of these berries.  Each piece is slightly larger than a traditional chocolate covered raisin.  The chocolate is very dark and shiny and thick.  The berry in the middle is barely discernable but definitely there.  A five pound bag is aboout 12 inches tall by 8 inches wide,  a good size bag of chocolate!  Overall, I am not sorry I ordered them, tasty and a reasonable value.

Please see attached for an example of test results for our treats; I have attached one of our VITALITY(tm) products that were tested recently.<br /><br />Our material suppliers are certified clean and clear of any contaminants. If raw ingredients do not meet their specifications and pass safety tests, then the ingredient is rejected immediately and never enters our processing facilities. Moreover, we strive to use products from suppliers that treat their animals humanely. Please see attached for an image of our chickens in their barn. I do not know of a reliable site that describes the process.<br /><br />Please know that we honestly believe that pets are family too and we feed our products to our own pets regularly. Again, we test product from each batch that is produced and have never had our results come back positive for ANY harmful ingredients.<br /><br />Please don't hesitate to contact me with ANY questions.<br /><br />Thank You,<br /><br />Jeff<br /><br />Jeff Haluck<br /><br />Marketing Assistant

review/summary: My dog loves these.
review/text: Purchased a case of these earlier last year.<br /><br />My picky dog absolutely loved these.  Can't hardly get him to take a dog treat that isn't in this shape, and heaven help me if it doesn't taste like this.  He'll leave them on the floor rather than eat them.<br /><br />Previous reviewer is correct, these don't freshen breath like a mint.  They do however work great in cleaning teeth and working out those particles that hang around decaying and stinking up your pet's mouth.<br /><br />This is the only doggie treat I'd recommend with 5 stars.

review/text: Usually, I never write reviews but I feel I must this time. I bought the 15oz Breathies from a local Petco and thought it was amazing (no health concerns experienced), so I decided to subscribe to these on Amazon as well. Unfortunately, the ones I received were contaminated and have been giving my puppies terrible diarrhea for the past 2weeks (we finally narrowed it down to the treats). After doing further research online, I discovered many other people had the same experiences. It's a great product, just not when contaminated - so good luck with the patch you receive (it is from China after all).

review/summary: Toy Poodle's favorite treat
review/text: Great snack or mixture that my toy poodle loves and will jump and cry for, far better treat than anything we've ever given her.  We take a strip and often cut it up into small pieces and mix with her food to help her get started with eating her regular food.  In addition, this helps my dog's breath and makes her happy as well as all of us who she likes to lick.  This is honestly the best treat we've found for our dog and amazon had the best prices I've found.  Setting this up on a regular delivery schedule has even saved me more money and keeps us with timely stock.  Well worth trying for your dog!

review/summary: Terrific treats, and apparently, a good company
review/text: I have been feeding these to my dogs for years.... They love them, and despite being made in China, they seem to be a reputable company with a good quality product.<br /><br />Then, today, I notice one of the last strips in the treat jar had white fuzz on it. This did not make me happy. Then, I received my new shipment of strips, and they were much darker than prior shipments. I immediately emailed the company, to let them know I was very concerned about the changes to these strips.<br /><br />I don't think it was two hours before I received a response, which admitted there was a packaging problem that caused the mold and that it had been addressed, and that a change in the manufacturing process had likely caused the darker color of the strips in the latest packages.<br /><br />For me, a personal response was very reassuring, my dog is my best buddy, and she loves these treats. Hopefully, their standards are as high as they claim, there is simply no way to know; not on anything you feed your pet, or anything you buy in the grocery store, but I will continue purchasing these for my Daisy.

review/summary: The best orange bitter available
review/text: Gary Regan's eponymous cocktail bitters are the best orange bitters available today.<br /><br />Not all cocktails are better with Angostura's classic bitters. Sometimes you want a little citrus lift in your drink. Although other orange bitters from Fee's, Stirring's  and Angostura itself are more widely available, they each have drawbacks. Fee's is overwhelmingly pungent... with orange extract notes that seem artificial. Antostura's Orange bitters don't have the magical concentration and complexity that regular Angostura has in spades. And Stirrings Orange Bitters aren't even bitters!

review/summary: Alchemy is at work here
review/text: This is a very well crafted product. Even though it's just an accent in most drinks you really get a huge depth of flavor from it. Despite being pretty alcoholic stuff it's even fairly palatable straight up (not that I'd serve it that way, but I tasted a few sips in a shot glass just to get a feel for it.) On the nose the straight product has a nice fresh orange scent followed by the bitter herb aroma and the alcohol, tasting it straight the orange is fresh but subdued by bitters with some notes of a cloves and fennel and wood.<br /><br />In my favorite application so far, the dry martini, it really ties the drink together and brings out the herbal notes in the gin in a very pleasing way. I'll no longer mix martinis without it.<br /><br />In a completely different area of the kitchen I flavored some sweetened whipped cream with a squeeze of fresh orange juice, a bit of zest and a few heavy dashes orange bitters for a nice not-too-sweet complement for rich chocolate desserts.

review/text: These bitters are fantastic. They are quite aromatic - as opposed to the Fee brothers orange that taste mostly like orange candy (which can be a good thing in some cocktails) - but they are more complex than the Angostura orange, which taste something like regular Angostura mixed with Fee's orange. A dash of Regan's orange rounds out a sidecar cocktail perfectly and turns this classic cocktail into a *classic* cocktail. It is nice that they also come in a bigger than usual 10 oz size.

review/text: I've been drinking this Bigelow green tea/chai blend about 6 months & it is my first choice every time I go to brew a cup of tea.  We also have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ51MG">Celestial Seasonings K-cups India Spice Chai, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HWWKGW">Bigelow Tea English Breakfast K-Cup For Keurig Brewers, 24-Count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> but I go through the Bigelow green/chai blend faster than the other two combined.<br /><br />As for personal taste, I don't like plain green tea, but do like chai tea (w/ milk).  However, I like this blend even better than just a plain chai blend.  I drink this tea with 2% or skim milk & 1 packet of sugar.<br /><br />This tea blend hits the spot and is perfect for my afternoon tea cravings.  As a bonus, one brew fills the office with a nice spicy scent.<br /><br />Disclosure: This product just came available through Amazon today, so we made our purchases through other sites.

If you are looking for that flavor, there is a chai latte k cup that seems to get good reviews. I would describe this more as a flavored green tea.<br /><br />I drink twice as much of this stuff as any other k-cup. Try it-- you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: IT's Not Chai
review/text: I purchased this product without reading the reviews beforehand.  However, had I read the reviews I might have been clued in that this product is not what the name claims!  It claims to be Chai Green Tea, but the pictures on the side of the box show that it is in fact 3 different types of teas (i.e.Grey,orange,etc.), not the one actual flavor of 'chai' tea like I had wanted.<br /><br />I bought this product as a holiday gift and if I had the option to send it back I would as I made this discovery while opening the shipment box. I would gladly send it back shrink-wrap intact and all for something else.<br /><br />IMO, 'chai tea' is a specific flavor produced from a blend of spices and based on that I was looking for the 'chai' in this product but didn't find it.<br /><br />I have nothing to add about the actual taste or quality since it is a gift for someone else, but I just thought I would put it out there in case someone else reads this first before buying.

review/summary: Bigelow Chai Green Tea
review/text: What I was expecting was a chai tea similar to one I find in popular coffee houses: a spiced tea infused with cream and sugar. This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Timothy's, Celestial, and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test. The K-cup chais are simply not the same as the coffee house chais. To approximate the coffee house chai you'll need to add your own cream/milk and sugar/honey and give it a little shake.

review/summary: Repeat customer
review/text: I'm a repeat customer. After the success I had with the first round of fortune cookies last year, I decided to order more cookies for the night of the Opening Ceremonies of the Olympics. A representative of Greenfire and I worked together and came up with 60 different Olympics-related fortunes and I ordered three pounds of them. My staff loved them. I brought them to a meeting at the start of the day, and we spent almost as much time reading the fortunes to each other as we spent working. After the meeting, I left them out for the staff go nibble away at, and by the end of the night, all three pounds were gone. I got a kick out of hearing my staff laughing at the fortunes we came up with. Two successful rounds of fortunes, and I plan on being back for a third round.

review/summary: Great taste and service! What a fortune...
review/text: This is the second time in 3 months we have ordered fortune cookies from Greenfire and again the service and cookies are impeccable. People were amazed to see that the fortunes were personalized and complimented us on the fact that they had never tasted such a fresh fortune cookie in their life. We'll order them again in June for the next trade show. Their service is very personal, they even check your copy and provide suggestions. Great people provide a great product that's for sure.
