review/summary: Helps with Heart Palpitations
review/text: After a little bit of research, I learned that magnesium plays a crucial role in the regulation of the heart. After being on medication for some time for unpleasant heart palpitations (which never worked too well), I decided to give this supplement a try. In about 2 months, the palpitations were completely gone, and I don't have to take that horrible drug anymore! This stuff is awesome. This was about a year ago. I have come to realize that doctors know nothing about caring for the human body and know very little about real nutrition. Your just a customer to them; they make their money by prescribing dangerous drugs that only mask symptoms but don't correct the problem at its source. Magnesium is so important for the body - you cannot go wrong with this supplement. Most people are deficient in this important mineral because the land is so devoid of important minerals these days, so it's very hard to get from food alone. This is the best magnesium supplement on the market. Don't take those cheap magnesium pills you can get at any store. Most of them don't get absorbed by the body and act only as a laxative. Magnesium citrate, of which this product is, gets assimilated easily. Don't be surprised if other problems your having begin to clear up as well. Magnesium deficiency can cause a lot of problems. Read the book "The Magnesium Miracle" for more info.<br /><br />Peace.

review/summary: A good nights sleep.
review/text: For most of my life I have had a hard time getting to sleep at night. It takes me hours some nights. I sit up and think about crap at work, people I went to school with as a child and all other kinds of random stuff. But I can honestly say this stuff does the trick. I've bought countless supplements over the years and none of it has really worked on helping me get to sleep but this stuff is the real deal. Overall I kind of feel more relaxed in general on it. Kind of at peace and stuff does not piss me off as much as usual. Give it a try. This stuff is legit. Start off slow on it at first. Your stomach needs a week or so to get use to it.

review/summary: Thank you, Natural Calm!
review/text: I have only taken this magnesium product for three days; however, within that time my heart palpitations have decreased significantly......as has my constant awareness of my heart beating.  Some people had mentioned a problem with diarrhea when using Natural Calm; however I have not been experiencing that - possibly because I am taking only 1/2 teaspoon daily.  I am satisfied with the unflavored product, likening it to a tart lemonade.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I am SO glad that I took a chance on Natural Calm!!!  A complete cardiac work-up revealed no major problems, and both my cardiologist and myself were at our wits end, trying to come up with a non-prescription remedy to address my unnerving heart beats.

review/summary: Better training recovery, much less pain, sleep like a baby
review/text: I discovered Peter Gilham's products a few months ago, and can speak for this product as well as the Osteo Calm, which adds calcium.  As a mature exerciser, recovery is always the biggest challenge, and this product eliminated my reliance on OTC anti-inflammatories.  I'm a physiologist who did contract work for a magnesium manufacturer and I've read most of the medical literature on Mg2+'s importance in the management of diabetes and vessel disease, and I don't think there's a better product than this one to address those issues. As magnesium pulls water into the gut, IMO it's the best remedy for sluggish elimination, and you must build the dose up slowly to prevent stools that are too loose.  For people with constipation, it's pretty much guaranteed to provide an immediate and permanent remedy.  And as magnesium is critical for the complete relaxation of muscle fibers, it's a first line treatment for chronic pain of any kind.  Even after months of using the Gilham Calm products, I still have to have my evening pretty much wrapped up before taking the supplement as it really knocks me out for sleep.  Deeper and more refreshed sleep is also a main objective to any chronic pain condition.<br /><br /> I switched to the Osteo Calm a couple of months ago in my desire to add a better piece to my menopausal osteoporosis prevention, and have found that product to be completely awesome also.

review/summary: A True Miracle for my 3 year old son!
review/text: I have struggled for the last year with my 3 year old son's constipation and fear of going "poo" on the potty. He also has been quite hyperactive in the past year; that coincided with a new brother (he is the middle child) as well as his efforts on potty training.  At the suggestion of my mother in law, we began using this product (1/2 tspn per day), and 10 days later, he began going poo on the potty with no problem at all, even asking to go, and went at school.  Prior to this, he would hold it because he was in so much pain when he went, and he never went away from the house!  We literaly BATTLED over going poo in the potty!  So this was the first miracle.  But then, within two days of that, he was back to my sweet, normal 3 year old boy and not so hyper and irritable.  He is smiling more, hugging us again, obeying simple rules and commands, and I feel like I have my son back!  I attribute all of this to the magnesium as we have not done anything different with his vitamins and diet than we had been doing for the last year.  He is also eating better, which I believe is because his tummy doesn't hurt as much now that he is regular.<br /><br />I do think I am going to cut back to 1/4 tspn/day though because the stools are a little looser, and he is taking 3 hour naps, so a little too sleepy.  But all in all, I am in LOVE with this product and highly recommend it for children as well as adults! My husband is about to start taking it to see if it helps with his sleep and his adult ADD that he suffers from.

review/text: I've struggled with sleep and muscle tension for years and was introduced to this power powder by a great friend (thanks hil!) who said it worked for her.  From day one, it's worked incredibly well.  I don't feel drugged or sedated, just relaxed.  I agree that it's pretty sweet and strong as far as flavor, but hey, I can deal!  Careful: it does fizz up quite a bit and can easily overflow a glass if left unchecked.  I'm really thankful to have this product as a natural alternative to the myriad of pharmacological sleep aids.  No dependence, no withdrawal, just great, relaxed, restful sleep.  Mazel tov, Natural Calm!!

review/summary: Works Great
review/text: I ordered the Original flavor.  It tastes a lot like Alka Seltzer, only stronger.  This product works really well.  Taken at the dose on the label, I did feel more relaxed and less stressed.  Once it got in my system, it was almost like taking a sleeping pill, as I would get very sleepy within an hour or so of taking it.  The problem for me was that it seemed to build up within my system.  And the relaxed mellow state I started in soon became the fatigued energy-less state.  At first, I didn't realize that it was caused by this product.  But when I stopped taking it, the extreme fatigue did stop.  I'm giving this product five stars, because it works REALLY well.  But you do have to watch your own body and adjust your dosage accordingly.  I still take this product, but just not as often, and not on a regular schedule.  Maybe that's just me.  Do try it, but just be aware of what it can do.

review/summary: Pleasing Results
review/text: Over the past few weeks, I was analyzing my typical daily nutrition and found I was lacking in magnesium. Like most Americans, I consume much more calcium than magnesium; the ratio of calcium to magnesium intake ideally needs to be 1-1.5:1. I read the reviews and thought it would be interesting to see if I could experience the calming effect on my muscles that many other reviewers have noted.<br /><br />I take two teaspoons (dissolved into a 500 mL water bottle) about an hour before I go to bed, and I do notice a calming effect. This product does not have the effect of a hypnotic or a benzodiazepine, so one should not expect it to "knock you out." Rather, I do experience a noticeable "lightening" of the muscles. As I lie in bed, I feel more comfortable and better able to focus on feeling comfortable because the muscles all throughout my body seem to be content to be in "off" mode; they are not as easily excitable as they are on my previously magnesium-deficient diet.<br /><br />I am pleased with this product and will continue taking two teapoons in water every night. I recommend this product to all who have found that they, too, are deficient in magnesium. I also agree that this product softens the stools and provides for a pleasant midday defecation. Cheers.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I have had a "twitching eyelid" problem for over a month now.  I've had that happen a few times here and there in the past, but never like this.  This was really getting bothersome, it was doing it like every 30 minutes or so for a few seconds at a time.  From the time I woke up till the time I went to bed.  It go so bad last week, I looked up again online about it...and somehow came across a forum where someone had the same problem and someone replied "you have a magnesium deficiency".  Well then I started looking up magnesium deficency and came upon this product.  I went and bought it the next day a local store.  And guess what??  My eye twitching has almost completely come to a STOP!!!  From something that was getting to be every 20-30 min. to now it does it about 2-3 times a day, much less noticable too, the twitching isn't as severe or bothersome.<br /><br />So I would have given this 5 stars, but I am still waiting to see if this supplement helps with any of the other problems, I've noticed after reading about magnesium deficiencies.  Those would be an added bonus if it helped with my other symptoms.  I am starting out with a small amount and will work my way up, and see if it gets any better with other things.  But I think it's great for just helping with my eye, it was literally driving me crazy!!<br />So glad I came upon this product...and the taste is really not bad at all.  I mix it with a whole glass of cold water, and it really only tastes like water with a lemon wedge in it, to me anyway...Maybe a larger amount of it, in less water might be too sweet, but it's really diluted in a full glass of water, so it isn't bad at all.

review/summary: One of the best nutritional supplements out there
review/text: A friend recommended that I try this product out due to my low blood levels of magnesium (some of the medications I was on depleted my body of Mg and K). I used to get cramping and soreness in my muscles after going for just minor walks or workouts. This product however, stopped the discomfort within hours of first taking it!<br /><br />If you read up on the side effects of low levels of Magnesium in the blood, you will be amazed to find out how many ailments result. The "Calm" is the answer without a doubt.<br /><br />I suffered from high blood pressure and hypertension for years, as well as an elevated heart rate. After taking this product, in conjunction to lifestyle changes, I began to feel better and all other cardiovascular issues normalized.<br /><br />When my doctor asked me what I changed in my life to make my numbers look better, I told her about the Calm, and she has since began using it herself and telling her other patients about it. Its a much quicker and easier way to get the essential Magnesium into your body fast and effectively. It certainly works better than trying to eat copious amounts of other Mg rich foods.<br /><br />Adhere to the serving sizes- especially at first. Magnesium makes for a darn good laxative if you take too much!!!<br /><br />This product is the cheapest here on Amazon. You'll likely spend $35-$45 at other health food stores.

review/summary: What else would you call this but "Calm?"
review/text: I had high hopes when I ordered this supplement, purportedly for one of my sons who was having some transitional stress issues...but I needed it as much (if not more.)  We have not been disappointed.  In fact, this supplement has exceeded all  hopes and expectations.  I suspect that my anxiety issues were beginning to negatively impact an important relationship. That has improved as have all my other relationships.  I am much more patient and centered, much less needy.  I have also noticed that there are no more occasional heart palpitations, no more twitchy legs either...no twitches of any kind. Also, as a budding middle-aged runner, this product IS helpful with muscle recovery.  I wish we had known about this product when our younger son was running track and cross country in high school.  It would have been tremendously helpful.  As others have noted, "Calm" is a wonderful aid in getting a restful night's sleep. A good night's sleep in-and-of itself is tremendously important to one's overall health. I will try never let myself run out of this supplement.  What a discovery!

review/summary: Hooked on this!
review/text: I'm a huge skeptic, but after 6 months of daily use, I do agree that this stuff is a necessary supplement in my life.  When I skip a couple days, I'm reminded.  I take it at night and it improves my otherwise slow system by the morning.  I continued being skeptical but noticed a marked improvement in my sleeping (more relaxed) and some muscle damage I had in my leg quickly healed (after one year of pain from an injury!).  I started off slow and had to graduate to a high dose - appx 3-4 tsp per day (was having serious constipation) -- after a week or so, I tapered down to a normal dose. I got my husband hooked on this stuff for the 'relaxing' effect alone (he is on the higher energy side).  It's subtle, not a drugged feeling when I say relaxing effect ... it's similar to melatonin without any groggy feeling.  My primary use is for constipation ... no more garbage over the counter drugs.  I never found improvement from pro-biotics either. This stuff helps with bloating and overall "uggh" feeling.  We both really like the taste, too.  If you like it more sweet/sour, then just use less water.  It's an artificial type sweetener, so no calories ... and I normally hate artificial sweetener taste, but it's hidden well.  It's similar to crystal light ... we get the raspberry/lemon flavor.  We take one dose every night.  I highly recommend!  Your local health food store might give you a sample ... try it for a few days but don't buy it from there ... come to Amazon because it's WAY cheaper :)  Good luck!

I preferred the organic orange to the lemon raspberry but it's only available in smaller containers, however it is a monthly must-buy for me.

review/summary: Helped Spouse That Has Fibromyalgia
review/text: I originally purchased Natural Calm to help with my own insomnia and anxiety issues. I started out with 1/2 teaspoon and gradually worked up to 1 teaspoon taken before bedtime. If I take more than 1 teaspoon, it has a laxative effect the next day. Even though it does help me relax, it doesn't really help with the insomnia. I've recently switched to Slow-Mag for a more sustained release of magnesium throughout the day. It doesn't have the same laxative effect, plus helps with daytime anxiety. However, my spouse (who has fibromyalgia) has had positive results with Natural Calm. It has improved his quality of sleep and also helped with muscle aches and overall fatigue. He takes about 1 to 1/2 teaspoons each night. I anticipate that he will want to continue purchasing Natural Calm. It doesn't work the same for everyone, but we are very happy with how the product has helped him so far.

review/summary: Restless Legs
review/text: My dad has SUFFERED with RLS(Restless Leg Syndrome)his entire life. Five years ago he was given a prescription drug, Requip, which helped some but has side effects of its own. I happened to be speaking to a friend, who recommended this as she had success with her own RLS by using this. I immediately ordered it for dad, and within a few weeks, he could tell a difference. What an answer to prayer!!!!!

review/summary: Finally good sleep
review/text: I'm a 31 year old woman and I have suffered from night terrors for my entire life. Since I started taking this supplement a couple of weeks ago I've slept through the night every night. Aside from that fact (that will keep me a customer for life on its own), I also just feel great in general. I take a teaspoon in the morning and a teaspoon in the evening which i dissolve in warm water. It tastes like a bland lemonade, which is fine by me. I'm not here for the flavor, i'm here for the health benefits. My bathroom trips are more regular and my muscles don't feel as sore after I exercise. One thing I would like to note, just in case it happens for anyone else, is that the first 3 days I was getting a pain in my temple randomly throughout the day. Research has led me to believe that this was from the artificial sweetener in the raspberry lemonade flavoring. I'm not having those pains anymore, and when I order again i'll probably stick with the same flavor. I hope this helps someone else may be on the fence about it.

review/text: I originally started taking this for muscle spasms/twitching. It seemed to take care of that in a matter of a few hours after I took it. I've been taking it every day for about a year now(so has my husband) and we have been sleeping better, and I truly do feel a bit more relaxed. I also started taking it in the morning and evening and have noticed I have been having less panic attacks.  I am not saying it "cured" them, but I definitely have noticed a difference (for the better) in severity and occurence.  I have not missed a "dose" in months.  This stuff rocks!

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I had been eating pumpkin seeds for magnesium for a while, but there are times when I want to get the mineral without a bunch of added calories (like late at night before bed). This stuff is great for that. It doesn't upset my stomach like a magnesium pill sometimes can, and it tastes good, and has no sugar. Maybe it is just placebo effect, but it seems like my teeth are smoother after I swish it around in my mouth for a while. Also, it sometimes helps me relax. I certainly will continue to buy it regularly. I recommend it to my family but none of them listen to me; their loss!

review/summary: Might be working?
review/text: I am an anxiety ridden person who just needs to calm down, so I tried this.  I think it has helped a little with restful sleep.  It also impacts bowel movements, so watch your dosage.  Read the directions: it needs to fizz in warm water before you drink it.  There's a raspberry-lemon flavor I would probably have liked better but didn't see it until after I ordered.  The flavor is bitter but it's such a small drink (2-3 oz) that it's acceptable.<br />I think valerian root works better for immediate relief.  This needs a longer time period to work well.

review/summary: Don't want to live without this
review/text: My daughter (who worked at a natural foods store as the supplements specialist) recommended this to me to help with muscle spasms, and it's really been of great benefit. After going through two 8oz packages, I was unable to afford it for a while. I really felt a difference without taking my Calm Plus Calcium twice a day. I found it much harder to relax and sleep at night, and started having spasms in my leg and back again. Recently purchased this 16 oz container thru Amazon, and have been taking it regularly again, and finally the spasms are mostly gone again. I hope they never stop making this product - I suppose I could live without it, but I would rather not!

review/summary: one of my favorite supplements
review/text: Magnesium deficiency can affect all aspects of health. I have tried various magnesium supplements, and this is my favorite. I feel, as the label says in bold letters, more CALM when I take this. There is less muscle tension in my body. I enjoy the taste as well, mixed with just 3-4 ounces of hot water, for a soothing warm lemon drink. I often take this with my calcium hydroxyapatite supplements, since both will work better together.<br /><br />Down sides: Need to be careful when making it, or it will fizz itself up and out of your cup. Also, if you get loose stools, adjust your dose down because it means you are taking more than you can absorb. Unfortunately, this is also a sign that your body isn't ABLE to absorb magnesium properly, in which case you may need to look into temporary IV or topical formulas until this is addressed.

review/summary: Great for sore muscles, helps with sleep, helps with menstrual cramps.
review/text: I've been using Natural Vitality Calm magnesium powder for years. It helps me get to sleep at night, especially after a stressful day or when I'm worried. I use it after I work out at the gym; or if I've got sore muscles from other activities such as gardening or heavy lifting. It is great for "that time of the month." It helps with cramps and mood swings. Calm comes in a few different flavors such as lemon, raspberry-lemon, and orange. I like the orange flavor the best. It's easy to use. Just mix a teaspoon or more of the powder with hot water. Then add a little cold water or cold juice and drink.  A hint: If you have trouble sleeping, try taking Calm and also take Vitamin B1 about a half hour before bed, to help with sleep. My chiropractor recommended that and it works for me. The magnesium in Calm has been formulated to absorb into the body and take effect quickly. There is a little booklet that is usually attached to the canister of Calm that gives more info on all of the benefits of magnesium in this form.

review/text: I'm so glad my doctor told me about this stuff.  I was having high blood pressure, anxiety attacks, just stressed out.  Also losing my hair but I haven't been taking it long enough to tell if that will help with this problem.  But, I'm not on blood pressure meds anymore, and I just feel calm, just as it is called.  Work has, and still is, very stressful, but this stuff helps me get through the day without the need to go home and have a glass of wine, or something stronger, every day.  It does not make me sleepy (I was afraid of that happening at work), but it does help me sleep better through the night.  I'm now hoping that this, in addition to some other things I'm taking, will help with my hair loss.

review/text: I have enjoyed Hershey's chocolate bars from the time that I was a child.  My two favorites are Hershey's Dark Chocolate and Hershey's Milk Chocolate with Almonds.  The combination of Hershey's sweet milk chocolate with chunks of whole almonds was a confectionary landmark that, in my opinion, only enhances the flavors of both.  Of course, being a bit weight conscious today, I don't eat Hershey's chocolate bars as often as I did in my childhood, but that doesn't alter my rating of them with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars!  Just be careful not to eat too many if, like me, you're concerned about your waistline.

review/text: Triple leaf makes the best white tea hands down. I swear this stuff cures me of any cold or flu (just drink a few cups a day when you start to feel something coming on). Also, I read studies that show white tea fights cavities, well guess what... I went to Dentist and had my teeth cleaned and they kept commenting on my clean teeth and how there was hardly any work for them. I'm a clean person but I dont have a great history of strong teeth. So, I was happy about that. Also, even if you dont buy Triple Leaf, just drink White Tea, ANy white tea! It has so much more in antioxidants than green tea and I know my brain function as well as health is better when I drink it daily. It also has been shown to kill bacteria such as MRSA and strep upon contact. I'm not saying if you have MRSA bathe in it, although I probably would to test it, but this is an awesome little tea!<br /><br />Oh yeah, Triple Leaf, I like triple leaf because of the taste, it has a sweeter taste than most white teas. You can find the tooth and bacteria info by looking up past research studies on Sciencedaily. Look at past 10years.

Hopefully the contents, picture, listing will all be corrected so others are not misled.

review/text: This is the first jar of manuka honey I've ever bought.  Both me and my mom tried a teaspoon and we both had heartburn from it later in the day!  I suppose other honeys, manuka and non-manuka would have the same effect on a sensitive stomach.  I still take it about half a teaspoon, but with tea, like I do with other honeys, and it doesn't cause problems.  Whether it has medicinal properties is hard to say, I put it on an inflamed gum and the inflammation went away BUT I used many other things on it so I don't know which helped.  It tastes very good though.<br />  This is the cheapest certified UMF 10 honey I found online, but it's still too expensive for the strength of its supposed healing powers... If it proves itself otherwise I'll change my reveiw.

review/summary: Very Good Chamomile!
review/text: After Teavana stopped selling their loose leaf chamomile I had to find another supplier.<br /><br />I first went to Mighty Leaf Tea Company for their chamomile loose leaf tea.<br /><br />Bad call on my part, I was stuck with 3 bags, each of which was mostly shake, stems, and non-uniform sized chamomile buds, which looks nothing like the photo on their web page. There was a faint chamomile aroma, but it was weak, much like the taste of the tea once steeped. I would very much recommend that you stay away from Mighty Leaf's chamomile.<br /><br />Next came the Argo Chamomile Blossoms tea. While not as aromatic as the Teavana, it was clearly superior to the Mighty Tea. The tea ships in a nice wide-mouth glass container.<br /><br />Perfect, as long as you can keep it out of the sun... and you certainly can clearly see what you have purchased, no hiding the product in a bag here. A little more shake than I like, but uniform buds with short stems, and an good aroma to boot. Steeps nicely, and gives a good clean taste.<br /><br />While the shipping took a little longer than I was happy with, I am overseas and I will give them another try.<br /><br />Look no further if you are looking for a very good loose leaf chamomile tea.<br /><br />***UPDATE*** (June 19, 2011)<br /><br />I received my second glass container shortly after the first, much less shake in this container. So I would give this product a solid 4.5 stars. Love the tea, great company, and I would HIGHLY recommend Argo Chamomile Blossoms tea.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I am not a fan of the so-called "Turkish" dried apricots, which are too soft and too sweet for my tastes. Rather I prefer these chewier, somewhat more tart "California-style" apricots. However, these Sun-Maid 'cots were a disappointment. They were quite small, very dry, and at least one bag was intolerably tart---not sweet at all. One bag was also filled incorrectly---only contained two or three apricot pieces. Amazon was kind enough to ship me another. If you have a Trader Joes' near you, check out their bulk bags of dried apricots---much tastier, and more affordable too.

I also noticed that the packaging doesn't call them California apricots, but rather "dried halves" and "product of USA, Chile, or Argentina".<br /><br />Stay away from this poor-quality product and buy something really tasty (I like Mariani's California Apricots).

review/summary: Best Apricots for Cooking and Baking!
review/text: I was SOOOO glad to find these on Amazon - and even happier to see that they offered auto delivery.  I don't care for Mediterranean or Turkish apricots as much, and California apricots have become increasingly hard to find.  My local grocery store (a MAJOR chain) recently stopped carrying them, so I immediately started searching online to see where they might be available.  Of course, Amazon was the first place I looked.  I love to cook these (just boil in some water for 15-20 minutes) and maybe add some sugar or artificial sweetener and eat them - especially when a lot of fresh fruits aren't in season.  I often eat them in place of jelly on toast.  But really - if you are searching for apricots to use to make a pie or smaller fried pies, these apricots can't be beat.  They are tart, have a great flavor, and cook up much better than other types of apricots, which usually remain whole, chunky or tough, even after cooking. Thanks, Amazon, for carrying these - and Sun-Maid, please continue to make them available!

review/text: I really prefer fresh apricots when I can find them, but the dried apricots will do as a substitute.  I have found that a fresh apricot (or two dried apricot halves) is an effective sppetite suppressent to eliminate hunger pangs if you are on a diet.  This particular brand seems a little drier than some others, but stores tend to have limited selections (you have to shop around).  These do not seem as sweet as some other brands, and individual consumers will have to judge which brands they prefer.  It does have an expiration date on the package, which in the present case was about 6 months after purchase.

review/text: I adore dried apricots. It seems that all I can find at the supermarket anymore is Turkish apricots, and they just aren't as flavorful as the ones from California. I don't know why that is; maybe they are a different species, maybe they're processed differently. Turkish apricots are dried whole, California apricots are cut in half. They are more expensive than Turkish apricots too, which seems counterintuitive. At any rate, they're worth it, and I'm so glad Amazon carries them

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I tried Miss Ellie's Hazelnut pods, since I can no longer get Senseo.  Miss Ellie's actually has more flavor, very smooth and delicious .<br />My only problem is, it cost as much to have it shipped, as the cost of the 18 pods.  Soooo not sure what to do.

review/summary: Excellent avocado oil
review/text: I hesitated to order this avocado oil because I had never heard of this brand before and didn't want to end up with two bottles of bad oil. Well, I am SO GLAD I went ahead and placed the order because this oil is simply excellent.<br /><br />I have tried extra virgin avocado oils from California and New Zealand and this Mexican oil is every bit as good and at a much better price.<br /><br />The oil is clear and has a buttery feel and subtle flavor. I use it mostly for stir-fry because of its very high smoke point (higher than refined coconut, grapeseed, peanut, almond, safflower), but it is also perfect in dishes where the peppery fruitiness of olive oil may be too overpowering.<br /><br />Amazon offers a very good deal on this oil. I just placed two more orders.<br /><br />Great product. Highly recommended.<br /><br />A word about the seller (Kalamala): I have already submitted a 5-star feedback for this seller, but I wanted to let prospective buyers know that the two 1 liter glass bottles arrived in perfect condition. Kalamala carefully wraps each bottle in bubble wrap and adds packing peanuts to the box for extra protection. See the photos I posted.

review/text: Love Love Love this Avocado oil. I have been purchasing Avocado oil in a can at the local grocery store (La Tourangelle brand) but was always disappointed by the fact that it contained a lot of impurities in it that made it unusable in certain cooking situations. For instance; for use in sauteing which was a shame because Avocado oil has an extremely high smoking point. This oil is totally pure and delicious. If you like popcorn this is the best oil for it. It's high smoking point and delicious flavor make it ideally suited for it. We are on our 4th liter since purchasing. We received a call from the business about month after initial purchase checking to see how the oil was and if we were pleased with the product. Who does that?!?!?!?!?

review/summary: Perfect Hostess Gift
review/text: Receiving two of these for $19.99 is quite a deal.  Going to someone's house and don't know what to bring? This really is THE perfect gift.  The bottle is attractive, the contents are great tasting and the cost is ideal.  It's not your average bottle of oil, it's avocado oil.  Seriously, perfect hostess gift.  Give one away, keep one for yourself.  Give two away.  Keep two for yourself!  Super deal!
