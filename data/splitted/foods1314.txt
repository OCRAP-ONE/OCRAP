review/summary: Great Tasting Crystallized Ginger
review/text: I am a sucker for ginger candy (can go through an entire bottle in less than a day.)This crystallized ginger from the Ginger People does not disappoint. Tasty, hot and sweet! Good stuff! Even better is their crystallized disc-shaped ginger in jars.<br /><br />This candy's good for medicinal purposes too -- helping with nausea or upset stomach. (And it does work too.)

review/text: The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3 is because I personally don't like it, and this is only my first real experience with ginger. To me, this tastes like spicy soap and candles. If you're a real ginger lover, great. Get this candy! If you haven't had any experience with plain ginger, try it, but keep a glass of milk or something next to you because it is spicy and the taste is different.

review/summary: EXCELLENT Quality & Taste; Very, Very Versatile Too
review/text: ~ I ordered Farie's Finest Coconut powder, Maple Flavored Powder, Peppermint Flavored Powder and Powdered Vanilla to send to my daughter in the Czech Republic because some foods like coconut and maple syrup can be hard to find or insanely expensive there.  I tasted this and it was delicious; I was especially pleased at how pure it tasted with absolutely no unpleasant residual flavors or tastes whatsoever.  To try it out I put a heaping tsp. of it into a cake mix to turn a pineapple upside down cake into an even better pina collada cake and it turned out absolutely scrumptious.  My greatest coconut secret is that I add some coconut to the chicken broth and herbs when 'infusion roasting' my turkey (it's an improvement on the beer can chicken method) because coconut really compliments and enhances the turkey flavor.  I love to cook and bake things more uniquely than everyone else does and powders are especially easy to mix into almost any dish; so I'm sure that I'll be thinking up many more creative ways to use this coconut powder.<br />~ In summary, I'm very impressed with the wide variety of products that Farie's Finest offers but I'm even more impressed with the quality and purity of flavor. I'm working on a large order for my own use and I can hardly wait to come up with new recipe idea's using Farie's Finest products.  So I gladly, very confidently and very, very highly recommend this company and their excellent products.

review/summary: Chalky chocolate, this is the New Hampshire version of Lindt 70% "Smooth Dark" rather than the "Extra Fine" or "Intense Dark"
review/text: If you are hoping for the foreign (Swiss or French) version of this product do not buy this, as it seems only certain sites off Amazon even stock it (I have found no seller on Amazon so far that does). Last fall Lindt reformulated their wonderfully balanced 70% recipe which was identical to the original Swiss formulation produced in both Switzerland and France. Nothing has changed despite the slew of negative reviews, the new bar is still chalky, bland, and terrible, cardboardy as most brands that cater to mass appeal (Hershey's, Dove, etc). True chocolate enthusiasts have to be content with either sending for ones outside the United States or switching to another brand. Lindt posted an excuse on their site that they reformulated the 70% recipe (under their FAQ, likely due to the high volume of complaints) due to more favorable responses to this "new recipe". In my opinion their R&D and marketing arm should be fired. The amount of negative reviews on this new recipe can be seen on any result for it on Amazon.

In fact they took 8 DAYS from order to delivery, which I thought was quite long! so beware!!  Secondly,  the roses arrived closed and quite limp.  My mother put them in a vase but to no avail.

review/summary: Pro Flowers Pulled Ads from Rush's Show
review/text: Those of you who've been blasting Pro=Flowers b/c they advertised on his show, do some research and update your comments!!!  Below is a COPY OF PRO-FLOWERS STATEMENT on "BOYCOTT RUSH..." Website:<br /><br />Here's what ProFlowers had to say: "At ProFlowers, our mission is to delight our customers with fresh and long lasting flowers, and that is our singular focus each and every day. We do not base our advertising decisions to align with any particular political view or opinion as our employees and customers are as diverse as the USA. Mr. Limbaugh?s recent comments went beyond political discourse to a personal attack and do not reflect our values as a company. As such, ProFlowers has suspended advertising on The Rush Limbaugh radio program."<br /><br />Online florist ProFlowers said Sunday it had suspended advertising on Rush Limbaugh's radio program because his comments about Georgetown University student Sandra Fluke "went beyond political discourse to a personal attack and do not reflect our values as a company."<br /><br />BTW, I ordered a bouquet from ProFlowers for my daughter who reported it was "beautiful" with each flower individually wrapped and carefully placed in its box.  The accompanying chocolates were delicious, she says!

Somehow the delivery date got mixed up and a delay of a day or so I was dissapointed at the service and complained. I got an e mail that a refund of $20.00 dollars and an apology from the customer service person at Pro Flowers changed my evaluation of the service to a positive review.<br />The roses btw, were very appreciated and said to be beautiful by my friend down south.I appreciate the customer service department for there evaluation of my complaint.

review/text: I have made purchases from you in the past. However, it is disconcerting to learn that a company selling flowers, the target market for which is women, (I would imagine), would give their advertizing dollars to such an individual as Rush Limbaugh.<br /><br />This creature has spent much of his time actively promoting an anti-female agenda. This week he stepped over the line, even for him. I refuse to dignify his commentary by repeating it.<br /><br />Neither I or my friends will be using your company for purchases as long as you continue to advertise on his program.

One would think that a flower company - whose products are primarily directed at women - would have been the first advertiser to withdraw their advertising.  Sadly, their actions show that they do support Rush's vile and demeaning language toward women.  Please choose a different flower company to show that you support the women you love.  Also, please spread the word to boycott this company to your friends and family.  Post on the company's Facebook and Twitter pages and ask them to stop supporting hate against women. (...)

Too plain, boring, watery and you won't find any lobster in the can.  But what do you expect for a can of pasta sauce that cost roughly $2-$3?

review/summary: The flavours are not lies!
review/text: These beans are a wonderful thing. The good flavors, you can eat, and they are totally fantastic. The terrible flavors, you can belittle the manhood of your friends with. The in-between flavors? Like grass? They're largely there to confuse you, and do so wonderfully.<br /><br />To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote:<br /><br />Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. "Okay," I begin "but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth."<br /><br />My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt!<br /><br />Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. "Alright," they said "This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow."<br /><br />Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth.<br /><br />It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg!<br /><br />Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful. The rotten egg, dirt, soap, and vomit beans all taste exactly what they are supposed to. And that is what makes them a fantastic product.

review/text: we sent these with bertie bunny jelly bean dispenser to our daughter in Texas for Easter.  The cute bunny makes the Harry Potter jelly beans even more of a surprise, mostly good, but always interesting.  These jelly beans are for fans of the books and movies, they are what they say they are, not a sweet treat but cool and great conversation starters!

The boxes are quite small, so yes- this is expensive for a few jelly beans. Gross ones at that. But my kids will have a ball tasting them and playing HP while they do. Thanks again, Amazon!

Be aware that each box is tiny - not much bigger than a small pack of gum or mints. My daughter enjoyed sharing them with her friends.

review/text: My son loves the Harry Potter books and movies so he had to have these as soon as he knew they were available. The box was very small and had only about 15 beans in it. There were several duplicates so he did not get one of each flavored, which was a bummer. I also think the price and shipping cost is outrageous for the size.

This is just what Bertie Botts supposed to be. But don't try it if you are NOT OK with awful flavors.I took a VOMIT one thinking it was cinnamon...and blueberry flavor tastes like dishwasher. I give it a five star because it is perfectly awful, but don't buy it if you haven't decided how much you can take...just don't!

review/text: I was told in a previous review that these beans were not good. They were right! Some were awful, and my kids enjoyed every miniute! During a Harry Potter themed birthday, we had an "every flavoured bean tasting" The dirt and grass were pretty realistic, but the vomit was a bit coconutty in taste. (Hmmm. Makes me wonder.) Anyway, they were not all meant to be delecious, yet some were (think, Tutti-Fruity) I would def give them a go again should we have the urge.

review/text: When Harry Potter first made its debut we had bought a bag of the Harry Potter Bertie Botts Every Flavour Jelly Beans for our children. Yes, they were perfectly disgusting... as they should be... and the kids loved trying to get people to eat vomit and rotten egg flavored jelly beans. Now we are at the end of the Harry Potter era and we purchased these for Christmas stockings. Still just as disgusting but who knew how SMALL each box was. 1.2 oz per box seemed acceptable but for $9 plus shipping????? At most they should have cost .50 to $1 per box. We won't be making that mistake again!

review/text: Well, it's not exactly what you'd consider the epitome of culinary delights, but then again, Harry Potter isn't exactly the normal boy either.  If you've read the books and wondered exactly what it is that the world of wizardry chooses for snack time, this has to be pretty darn close if not spot on.  I wouldn't choose to eat a ton of these, but they're great for Potter parties and the like.  I would suggest looking at the Jelly Belly website as well.  They have some better deals on price, but depending on what else you order, shipping may exceed the savings.  I recommend the crispy frogs, too.  And careful when you open the package - they may jump!

If I had known how small the boxes were (I honestly did not check size before purchasing-lesson learned!) I would not have bought them.  I had to be very skimpy with the kids on how many they could try so that each child got to eat a couple-and we only had 10 kids there!  Fun, but pricey!

review/summary: Versatile flavoring for anything you want to make
review/text: Good Seasons Italian dressing is one of the most versatile spices in my rack.  I don't only use it as a salad dressing (though it makes an excellent one), but it's also a lovely topping to toss fresh or steamed vegetables in to add a little bit of flavor.  Also, typically when I am making it into a sald dressing I use extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar for a tasty vinaigrette that's great on any salad.  There are also usually a number of recipes on any packet you buy giving you a number of new ideas for using this versatile flavoring.

review/summary: My secret ingredient!
review/text: My grandma was an amazing cook. She passed on many of her secrets, and this was one of them. Not only do we use this this as a versatile salad dressing (mix it with different citrus juices or vinegars and oils for a variety of great flavors) but we add it to spaghetti sauce, coat chicken with it before baking, mix it in with rice, add it to bread dough, and more. It's a great all-around seasoning mix that you can use to punch up the flavor in just about anything and make it even more savory.

review/text: Besides the excellent salad dressing you can mix up, controling the type and amount of oil used -- this is an excellent add-in for turkey burgers, giving them a richer flavor.<br /><br />Good Seasons is a tried-and-true product that's been around for years. If you've never used it, you'll be amazed at it's wonderful flavor and the versatility of uses that can make lots of foods extra-special.

review/summary: Good Dressing
review/text: I am currently living in Hungary and I have yet to find Italian dressing in a store. There may be specialty stores that import it, but then it would cost an arm and a leg. Shipping stuff here from the US is also prohibitively expensive and so mix packets are the best way to go. When I have friends coming out, they can pack it in a suit case without killing their weight allowance.<br /><br />The family loves it and I enjoy having a little control over exactly how the dressing will taste by being able to make changes in type of vinegar. It's very good and the whole family likes it.

review/text: I've fallen in love all over again.<br /><br />For months I've eaten salads constantly just to have an excuse to use this dressing. No joke.<br /><br />For awhile there I was sneaking shots of salad dressing just for that glorious *pop* of flavor... wow.<br /><br />I did end up going with the cheaper "non-zesty" and that's good too (especially if you pump up the vinegar a little) but the Zesty is where it's at... it's definitely the magical taste of my youth and has singlehandedly addicted me to salad.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: Good Seasons Zesty Italian is wonderful. People rave about my salads and I always use Good Seasons Zesty Italian. I use apple cider vinegar and saffola oil. I've tried using olive oil but it doesn't have quite the good taste that the saffola oil has. For spinach salad I put in bacon, lots of green onion, mushrooms, avacado, lots of parmesan cheese, hard boiled eggs and croutons. I love this dressing.

review/summary: TRY THIS!
review/text: Due to the nasty junk most store bought salad dressings have in them and the new way of eating I have adopted, I wanted a salad dressing that wouldn't take away from the healthy aspect of eating the salad!  So I turned to Good Season's Zesty Italian Mix!  My new eating way of eating, calls for no grains, no beans, no soy, no sugar, no potatoes and no artificial sweetners (save for Stevia), most of your "Healthy pre-packaged Salad Dressings" despite calling themselves 'Extra Virgin Olive... Salad Dressings' all you have to do is read the ingreds. and you find Soy oil and canola oil or other kinda of oil, which ARE NOT GOOD FOR YOU!!!  Enter Good Season's Zesty Italian Dressings Mix!  Yes, it does have a little sugar, but very little, and when you get some High quality Extra Virgin, 1st Press, Cold Press Olive Oil and a very good Balsamic Vinegar, and use it in place of the oil and vinegar on the mix instructions, you end up with a SUPER Balsamic Vinaigrette!!! Better than any store bought that I have tried!  It is super on any salad, but especially salads with fresh fruit in them.  It is also wonderful on chicken and beef, especially sandwhiches!  TRY THE Mix and my Balsamic Vinaigrette recipe... you will thank me for the recommendation!  LOL!

review/summary: Not for the health of it, not for everyone, but very addictive
review/text: My girlfriend bought an expired box which was 2.5 years expired. We thought about throwing it away, but instead sampled it. It was stale, to a degree, but the floral taste and smell was still present and that unique flavor was there. A very different gum then something like FALIM. Overtime it became addictive, where I just had to have more. YES, this gum is SUGAR COATED, but that vanishes rather quickly, and then you're left with only the mastic. If you like flowery tasting things, say, IPA beer or eating marigolds, lol, this might be for you.

review/text: Upon doing some research on this product I have found it to be quite good, the pieces are fun to chew and it is great to have something with mastic in it. The oil from the mastic tree seems to have the medicinal effects needed by the USA in chewing gum. This should be where gum starts and then goes into gums that help you in other ways through herbal enhancements.

review/text: This is chicklet style gum so two per pack. It stays fresh because each pair is in a plastic baggie. Cute box and so much for so cheap! The texture is very nice and smooth. I was surprised by that. The taste is mastic so that is something to note if you are unaware of what that tastes like. It smells (and tastes) VERY strong. I had to put the gum in several bags because otherwise I could smell it within a few feet of the box.

review/text: I was very happy to find this gum on amazon. This is my favorite brand of mastic gum. Two pieces (chicklet size) are individually wrapped, so everything stays fresh. If you've never had mastic flavored gum, it is different. It is sort of herbal or flowery. You either like it or you don't, but if you are a fan of mastic gum this is a great buy.

Only negative comment is that the flavour doesn't last long - but if you're like me you'll keep chewing the stuff for hours anyway, and the texture doesn't go hard or anything, like with some types of gum.  Overall a really great product.

review/summary: Any flavor Fancy Feast!
review/text: My two cats just love any flavor Fancy Feast.  Both are getting older now, and one was losing weight to the point of seeing the rib cage and hip bones.  I started feeding two cans a day--divided for both cats--about 3 months ago, and now he has filled out enough that I can't see bones.  He is a big cat, long I mean, so it may take awhile.  Maybe I should be feeding 3 cans. He needs to gain another 5 lbs before he's back to his old self.  He's been wormed by the vet.  They especially love this chicken hearts and liver.  It has lots of gravy.  They also like the elegant medleys with the veges.  They are not so fond of the beef, but eat it.  Buy it, you'll be pleasantly surprised!

I did end up getting her on Blue Buffalo but at $1.25 for 3 oz I simply couldn't afford it.  My friend suggested chicken hearts and liver.  She loves it!  Even warmed in the microwave she loves it!  Plus this can is only 74 calories as suppose to the 84-89 calories of most fancy feast cans.  Smells a bit strong but its worth it.  And this case is a great price if your cat loves it.

review/text: This mochi treat is very yummy--I get them from the grocery store so I'm not sure how great they are from amazon vendors but when I buy them they are very very soft, almost like a very soft gummy, with a green tea flavor filling that does taste pretty authentic. The texture of the filling is thick, almost like preserves, and feels like beans without the peeling but it's not a savory or salty bean flavor--it is mellow and sweet. I only give it four stars because no storebought mochi could compare to homemade, but this is still very very good.
