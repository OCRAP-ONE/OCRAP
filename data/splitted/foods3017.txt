review/summary: Excellent product.
review/text: Delicious little crystals of perfection. This sugar has a beautiful texture, which looks like a perfect topper to homemade cookies. IT has a rich molasses type of flavor, similar to brown sugar. Tastes like brown sugar, but has perfect little clear crystals. Tasty and beautiful as well. IT looks great in a little sugar bowl, with a silver spoon during tea service.

review/summary: Great Demerara sugar, and great value
review/text: Being a bit of a foodie, I very much appreciate the taste of raw sugar in my coffee or tea. I use to buy sugar in the raw, but noticed that at 2.50 a pound, that it was somewhat of an expensive habit. A quick search on Amazon and I found this much less expensive alternative, but it's just as flavorful. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Absolutely Awful Cat Food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs." Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/summary: Red dye in cat food ruins carpeting - don't buy if you have carpet
review/text: Made the big mistake of buying Meow-Mix.<br /><br />Cat vomited (as all cats sometimes due) after eating Meow-Mix. Unfortunately the cat vomited on carpet. Usually unfortunate but no big deal - just clean it up. WRONG! Meow-Mix has red food dyes that will not come out - even if you start cleaning right after the event. We have tried three different cleaners and a carpet machine. We still have two big red/pink stains in the carpet.<br /><br />I called the MeowMix customer service number and asked for some help on how to clean their red dye out of the carpeting. They told me to use a carpet cleaner - Really? Wow. Insightful.<br /><br />I asked them why they put in apparently un-cleanable red dye in the cat food when they know cats are virtually color blind (for reds apparently) and when the cat pukes it is going to ruin their customers carpet. They said market research indicated the human buyers prefer to see a red, meaty, color and their was nothing they could do about it.<br /><br />Yeah, how about not putting the red dye in or using another red dye?<br /><br />Through almost and entire 25lb bag of MeowMix out in the trash and purchased Iams which is no issue to clean up.<br /><br />Thanks for reading. Don't buy MeowMix unless you live outdoors  .

review/summary: Warm and smooth, best with a couple of whiskey stones
review/text: Picked this up at the local ABC store where it was on sale as the last item of stock.  Ours was actually 15+ years old when we opened it, and it was deliciously smooth, with a lot of warmth and great mouth feel.  Kick was in the mid-palette, clean finish.  I was very impressed with how smooth this is - it makes Rare Breed seem cheap.  I will say the flavor tended to trend towards bitter as it warmed up, so if you have a couple of whiskey stones, I would suggest using them to maintain the flavor while sipping.  More than perhaps a single ice cube if you don't have stones would be a travesty - this is some really, really good bourbon.

I added about half the bottle to the cake mix (white cake--NOT vanilla), and the other half to the frosting (white frosting--NOT vanilla) and it still only had a HINT of blueberry flavor.  I was completely disappointed in all the time, effort and money spent making it, and it barely tasted blueberry.  I would have thought that using the WHOLE bottle would have made a blueberry flavor.  I guess I will have to see if I can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry FLAVORED extract.  Will not be wasting my money on this again.  :(

It will definitely give you gas but no other side effects.

While the world may never know, you will have 100 chances with assorted flavors to try for yourself.<br /><br />It has been a while since I last saw Kojak with a Tootsie Roll Pop in his mouth, but I am unable to recall if he ever got to the point where he bit through to the center.

Also, Tootsie Roll Pops are alternatively called Tootsie Pops, as noted on the Tootsie Roll web site.<br /><br />Tootsie Roll Pops, invented in 1931, have been one of my favorites since my childhood.

Orange.  Cherry.  Delectable chocolate.  All assorted flavors blaze trails of zesty taste over your tongue; all of them end in a soft Tootsie Roll center payoff.  I have acquired the discipline (though it's been hard) to hold off biting through the hard shell candy--to work the TOOTSIE POP down to its vulnerable chocolaty center--so that I may experience repeated Tootsie Nirvana.  No other sucker offers such an experience, which is why TOOTSIE POPS (ASSORTED FLAVORS) are indeed the one and only.  Go ahead.  Pop one in your mouth today!<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

Also they are not a good source of vitamins and minerals although they say that too.

She also likes the fact they are chewy.<br /><br />Conclusions: These treats are alright for a treat. Something used once in awhile. I wouldn't recomend giving them more then once a week. Do not assume they are a healthy treat full of vitamins and minerals...mostly sugar.

review/text: These are great chips.  Anyone form the Eastern US can just run to the market and grab a bag, but us left-coasters are left longing for that very potato-ey taste of Wise Potato Chips.  Looking at the products offered by Wise on AMazon I thought that this product would be a great way to sample chips that I hadn't tried.  Since these said "Labeled for individual package sales" I thought that they would be a great size.  It turns out that these are the TINY bags that aren't sold in stores, they are stuck in your kids lunch bag.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - Wise chips are unreal-good.  I've made potato chips at home and the wise are THAT good.<br />But these packages are too small to even get more than a taste of the chip.<br /><br />Also, since the bags are so small, you aren't getting the actual full size of the potato chip - just a small version with not-quite-as-much burst in your mouth flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Great for kids lunch<br />Bad for enjoying a bag of Wise chips.<br /><br />I'm going to try the larger bags next, fingers crossed!

review/summary: Great Tomatoes...Great Price
review/text: I found Carmelina's after researching tomatoes for pizza sauce, spaghetti sauce, etc., and first tried them after picking up various brands at Whole Foods and other local markets & delis in my area. I can now say these are my definite favorites of all the kinds I've tried, be it DOP certified or non DOP certified. I also like that they have no basil or citric acid added, just tomatoes in puree. I can always add the other flavors when or if I choose.<br /><br />  Price wise, Amazon can't be beat. Average price I paid locally was $1.70 per can, (plus my time and gas to get there), compared with Amazon's price of approximately $1.20 a can. The free super saver shipping was an added attraction, and after placing my order, was pleasantly surprised to receive them in 4 days. Now that's what I call service!!!<br /><br />  They came packed in a Carmelina box from Italy, which was then put into an Amazon box in which some brown craft paper was wadded up on top to fill the space. As a previous poster has said, I also received 9 dented cans, but not so bad that I can't use them. Also on the plus side was the fact that the expiration date was months if not a year better than cans I picked up around town.<br /><br />  All in all, I'm very happy with the service provide by Amazon, and the product provided by Carmelina's, and will be a repeat customer in the future.

A few cans were slightly distorted from normal handling but not seriously dented and all 24 were perfectly usable.<br /><br />We've replaced canned tomato sauce in all of our favorite recipes with these ravishing red beauties from Italy and we're never going back.  Aside from being peeled and then pasteurized in the can, these San Marzano plum tomatoes are just about as fresh as when they were plucked off the vine in the Campania region of Italy.  That means they aren't cooked until you cook them, and what a difference THAT makes, especially with sauces simmered all day in a slow cooker or thrown together on the spur of the moment in a pressure cooker.<br /><br />Amazon.com's Free Super Saver shipping makes them a bargain compared to ordinary canned tomatoes and a steal versus the price of San Marzano tomatoes from the store.

review/summary: Great tomatoes at a great price March 2012
review/text: Do not be fooled by negative reviews that bring down these five-star tomatoes.  Carmelina Brands resolved the issue with the Italian government and these are now labeled "San Marzano" tomatoes.  They are not DOP certified and that is why they are at a great price. There is no basil or salt added so you cannot compare to other products that aren't just peeled tomatoes in puree.  I am a 2nd generation Italian-American and have tried many brands of Italian tomatoes and domestic San Marzano tomatoes and these are fantastic tomatoes at a price that cannot be beat.<br /><br />Amazon had serious shipment problems that resulted in many dented cans.  Amazon reshipped several times at no charge but I continued to receive dented cans.  Today I received a new shipment on my subscribe and save plan and not one dented can. Amazon placed the manufacturer's shipping box in another box with sufficient protection.  Great Job Amazon.!

review/summary: possible clarification of san marzano or not
review/text: I think that the label does confuse people; after  doing a little research I believe the words "Carmelina 'e San Marzano" - are the BRAND name; the rest of the label then identifies the contents, simply "italian peeled tomatoes". The product description adds to the confusion by stating they are San Marzanos; from the information I found, true San Marzanos are certified by the Italian Government and the label must say DOP on it. For being a specific seed strain grown in a specific region, certification and import all add up to the fact that they'll typically cost about three times more per can than these Carmelina Brand tomatoes.<br /><br />I was looking for a taste and texture that was lacking in what I'd found on stores shelves in general. San Marzanos are definitely sweeter and less acidic than this Carmelita brand but these do taste like *real* tomatoes - for zero other ingredients I'd say they are "fair" in flavor and "good" if you prefer your tomatoes a little more on the acidic side. I think these would make a good base for spicier or fra diavolo type sauces.<br /><br />Bottom line is I wouldn't exactly be eating these straight out of the can but with the right ingredients they could be used to make a pretty good start to a sauce.

review/summary: Carmelina's canned tomatoes
review/text: Theses are very good tomatoes from Italy.  Not DOP so they are abit more reasonably priced.  Nice size cans for a single serving.<br />It is really great to get a big box delivered to my door so promptly.  I don't have to lug bags full of heavy cans from the grocery store. It is easy to open the top of the box and store underneath the chopping block or another spot.  The auto reorder saves a few dollars and makes it so easy.  Great tomatoes for sauce or to use in other recipes.  I like to make a soup with a can of Campbell's Old Fashioned Tomatoe and Rice and a can of the Carmelina's tomatoes chopped up.  Add a few herbs and dollop of butter and some s / p and you have a nice lunch.  I sometimes add a spoonful of cottage cheese to the center of my bowl of soup.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Amazon Should Clarify if these ARE NOT San Marzano Tomatoes
review/text: I placed an order for these at the beginning of this year as a treat for myself.  I have grown San Marzano tomatoes and am familiar with what they taste like.  Like other reviewers, I quickly discovered that I did not receive San Marzano tomatoes.  I called Amazon and they sent a replacement shipment.  The replacement shipment was also not San Marzano, so I called Amazon again.  They refunded my money and removed this listing from their website to investigate the issue, so I do not understand why this issue continues.  While these are good canned tomatoes, they ARE NOT San Marzano, and so I would urge everyone who receives the wrong product to contact Amazon to resolve the issue.  While I'd really like to place another order for San Marzano's with Amazon, I am hesitant to do so because I do not feel assured that I will get the product I want.  San Marzano's are the sweetest most delicious sauce tomatoes I've ever eaten, and you will know what they are once you've had them.

Since there was no quantity listed I considered the shipping weight of 2# listed and believed that was plenty of weight to include an full box of 30 packets, but to my disappointment I received 16. I wrote to the seller and they promptly responded to me that it was supposed to be only 15 packets and that I should read the customer reviews in order to gain the needed information.  The information should be in the product description so there is no guessing.<br />I have paid the same price in recent months for 30 packets so this price is not a good deal.

This splendid tasting stuff is good on sliced cucumbers, a salad of greens with chicken breast, or on a slice of whole wheat bread.  (I just had some sprayed on a slice of bread for a snack.)  Remember to shake the bottle to get all the good taste.  The Wish Bone people call it "Great ranch taste in a creamy vinaigrette dressing is the perfect pairing to any salad or vegetable snack."  They are right.<br /><br />Ten sprays, which contain only 15 calories or 2 calories per spray, are enough to coat a cup of salad.  Ranch dressing has a wonderful taste, but it is extremely rich and high in calories.  Here is a way to enjoy all that wonderful taste without the excessive calories.

Maybe UPS played football with my package, but maybe for such a delicate product they should used a more robust container.  It's worth noting that the box didn't LOOK like it had been mishandled.<br /><br />Just a little disappointed for that reason... if I had gotten a full bag of usable treats this would be a five star review.

Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the "Dr. Pepper": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind.

review/text: Just recently purchase as I like the soda taste but not the amount of sugar in Soda.  Have tried all flavors and regardless of soda, they all have the DIET aftertaste.  If you suffer from migrains (as I do) the artificial sweetener used in the soda syrups will only cause more pain and surprisingly quickly.  There truely needs to be an alternative to the artificial sweetner for this to be a soda substitute.

review/text: I like the taste of coke and pepsi, if I had to choose between both of them I would choose Pepsi.  The soda stream cola is awful.  I can normally drink any soda, but this one is almost undrinkable.  I gave it two stars because it is better for the environment.

review/summary: I won't buy it again
review/text: The regular Cola is OK at best.  I bought the Sodastream and was unaware that most of the flavors have acesulfame potassium.  The Cola has a chemical taste which I think is coming from the acesulfame potassium.  I'm not a health food nut but I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  The sample pack had some good tasting flavors such as Orange, Dr. Pepper, and Root Bear which all tasted as good as anything you buy in the store.  However I'm a cola drinker and the regular cola won't cut it for me.  The Diet Cola is even worse.  I'd like to try the Tonic but the reviews are terrible.  I'm planning on trying the All Natural Cola.  If the Natural Cola does not work I will be selling the Sodastream.  Sodastream is a ingenious idea, but unless they can come up with better cola's I think it will be a passing fad.

review/summary: SULFITES!!!! NOT MENTIONED BUT INCLUDED!!!!
review/text: I have worked for a major retailer for the past 20 years, we sell Soda Stream and all its accessories.  I even performed ALL the product samplings this past 4th quarter.  I bought one for myself.  I like it okay but slowly came to realize that every time I drank the diet cola my face would erupt with cysts that were huge and raw.  I thought it was stress or something else.  I went to an allergist and tested with very strong reaction to "sulfites".  everyone, I mean EVERYONE look at your bottles of syrup and despite all the "healthy" mumbo jumbo find the small print "contains sulfites".  My Dr. told me to stop drinking the soda stream diet cola (I believe all the flavors have sulfites, but I could be wrong) for several weeks.  I complied and stuck with good old Diet Coke.  My face cleared up within a few days and was cyst free.  Them my Dr. instructed me to make a batch of the diet cola in the 1 liter bottle and drink it throughout 1 day.  The next day the cysts were forming again and then progresively got worse.  Stopped using soda stream products completely and have had NO flair ups since.  I would be very careful as sulfites have many bad side effects.  I truly loved the product, its simplicity and sold tons of it because I thought it was great.  Little did I know I was selling something tainted with sulfites.  If you have noticed any strange blisters, cysts or acne do as I did with my Dr.s instructions and see for yourself.  I am male so don't insinuate it was a "monthly menstrual cycle".  BEWARE.

review/summary: SodaStream Jet
review/text: My family LOVES the sodaStream fizzy water,  and HATES the flavors SodaStream makes-  there is a definite aftertaste of Not-Sugar (sucralose) in the concentrates,  which can trigger migraines in sensitive people (like us).  However,  we have found that mixing the fizzy water with half juice (real cranberry is a favorite, and even the V8 V-Fusion juice blends)  gets us drinking more water and less juice without sacrificing taste. For lightly-flavored waters we do use a small amount of natural flavor extracts (we like McNess- no propylene glycol)  rather than the fruit flavors offered by SodaStream.  Definitely get an extra 2-pack of bottles,  though,  to keep chilled water ready for fizzing in the fridge. The gas cartridge refills  are quite easily found, as well.

review/text: Even though I opted out of recieving "email reminders" to leave feedback/reviews I just received one from this company, so here's my review:<br /><br />I've already left a review for the SodaStream machine, and it is not complimentary due to the monopoly on the CO2.  Had this firm read my recent reviews they would have seen that I dislike being asked to leave feedback and reviews.  It is unprofessional.<br /><br />The product is just ok, but being hounded to leave reviews/feedback prevents even a three star review.  If I were to buy this product again, and that is very doubtful, I'd go back to buying from a brick and mortar retail store, pay a higher price and sales tax.

review/summary: The taste isn't quite right...
review/text: I love the product so far - I think it's a great idea, saves money and saves me from carrying heavy bottles up 3 flights of stairs... but the syrup tastes "off". I would compare the regular flavors to off-brand, diet soda, and I haven't tried the diet flavors yet because I can't imagine that they would taste any better. I can tell that they use Splenda (or something other than real sugar) because the "sweet" taste that's found in most sodas is just not there.<br /><br />All of that aside, most of the flavors DO taste similar their counterparts (Fountain Mist = Mountain Dew, Lemon Lime = Sprite, etc.) I would recommend getting the Variety Pack to find which things you like before you buy a bottle that makes 12 liters.

review/summary: great product
review/text: I purchased the Soda Stream (Starter Kit)  as a Father's Day gift for my husband. We both enjoy soda water, but there are only a few brands we've found which do not taste "soapy."<br /><br />We've only had it for a week, but this little gadget works as advertised. It is easy and quick  and effective to use, and we all like that we can control the level of "fizz."  I like more, the kids like less. I bought extra bottles and flavorings (for the kids) so everyone could do their own. We use it mostly with filtered water, although the tap water works perfectly well too, as long as you have good tap water.<br /><br />The flavorings will be used  not as much around here, although they seem good and the kids like them.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product. The only caveat I would give at this point, is make sure you want more "gas" in your life.  My entire family is doing a lot more belching and burping than we ever have before, but we like this machine!

review/summary: Misleading discription-bad taste
review/text: They advertise that they contain 'no aspartame in diet flavors' and boldly state 'no high fructose corn syrup', but the regular flavors contain sucralose artificial sweetners making it taste awful. No disclaimer on the front of the bottle. How can they legally NOT call it DIET if it has artificial sweetners? Anyway, unless you like and can drink diet drinks you will not like 'regular' flavors either.

review/text: Sodastream bills itself as an ecological alternative to disposable bottles.  However, if you look at the fine print on the bottles, the syrups are made in Israel.

review/summary: What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical
review/text: The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

I may be on either side of the trade by the time you read this -- I am not very sentimental.

review/summary: Warning, non-diet syrup contains Sucralose (Splenda)
review/text: This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a "half diet" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.

review/summary: Sodastream
review/text: After years of dealing with increasing price of soda, finding place to store it and returning  empty bottles decided to give this a try. We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.<br /><br /> I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store. For me the SodaStream is well worth the cost.

review/summary: Great flavor, and even better price.
review/text: I drink energy drinks maybe once or twice per week.  I usually stick to red bull or rock star as those cans don't overdo the caffeine and have a decent flavor.  The soda stream mix tastes very similar to rock star and costs a lot less money.  Just watch your serving size when you use the soda stream.  All canned energy drinks have a limit whereas you could drink the whole bottle of soda stream if you don't watch your serving size.

review/summary: Some are good, some are not so much.
review/text: Some of the flavors we have tried:<br />Diet Cola<br />I do not like diet cola. I don't like diet Coke, diet Pepsi or diet other drinks. We bought this flavor so we could make diet drinks for someone who might like a diet cola when we were making our own soda. However, this is really one of the better diet drinks that I have tried. If you make your own soda, this is a good one to try.<br /><br />Orange<br />This is the best one by far of all of the flavors we have tried. This flavor tastes just like the fanta orange soda. We love this one.<br /><br />Cola<br />This cola flavoring is ok. It's not great. You can easily make simple syrups that will not be a cola flavor but will taste much better than this flavor. This is the equivalent of RC Cola. Ok but it's not near as good as other name brand colas.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: The Soda Club machine is great.  We enjoy all the flavors (excluding the mango one).  I read the other reviews, my family doesn't understand what after taste they are refering too.  I have been drinking Pepsi all my life.  It is finally great to have soda without aspartame and corn syrup!  Plus, I am saving lugging 2-liter jugs from the grocery store and have cut down on the amount of garbage I throw out.  There are a lot of flavors at [...].  Yeah for Soda Club!!

review/summary: Nasty-Tasting Stuff
review/text: This is the worst tasting cola I've ever tried. It has a horrible after-taste that is completly unacceptable. I'm now stuck with a very exspensive machine, that I can make carbonated water with, and replacing the carbonator is around $80.00. Bad purchase.

review/summary: Good idea, needs some tweaks...
review/text: I love the Soda Stream unit, but the syrups need some tweaks.  It is too sweet, so I use half the amount required; this is good if you want the product to last longer; this is bad because they use Splenda added to all their recipes, not just the diet.  If they would just use plain old sugar, I'd be much happier with this product.

review/summary: Splenda in every flavor...tastes horrible
review/text: Wanted the Sodastream for my birthday.  Got it, made up the first cola.  It was horrid.  Got to reading about the products.  Sodastream seems to be so proud that they did not include aspartame in their diet products, and used only sugar in their non-diet products (Instead of high fructose corn syrup).  However, they also put Splenda (another artificial sweetner like aspertame) in every flavor they make...diet or not.  It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the non-diet drinks.  The whole point of not drinking diet pop is because people don't like the taste of diet pop.  My Sodastream is going back to the company with a message stating that if I wanted diet pop I would buy it myself, and they should only put sugar in regular soda.  They brag about real sugar, and then hide artifical sweetner in every product hoping no one will notice.  It shows in the bad taste of their regular sodas, and, in my opinion, does not make them a very reputable company.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Decent Set of Flavors But
review/text: You have to sample them all to find the ones you like.  You'll miss out if you judge them all after tasting one or two.  My favorites are Diet Orange, Diet Raspberry/Cranberry, and Diet Energy. Diet Dr. Pete and Diet Root Beer aren't bad either.  They mix well with alcoholic beverages as well.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />I encourage everyone to visit the SodaStream webstore BEFORE purchasing any of products here. There are many flavors at the SodaStream webstore not offered here like DIET Energy and DIET Orange.  Also, as of 2/15/2012, they charge 40-50% less at the SodaStream webstore but you may have to pay for shipping.  However, if you buy 10 bottles at Sodastream, you'll get 1 bottle free.  I'm not slamming the Amazon merchants but I think consumers should be aware of the significant price mark-up.<br /><br />(With this exception, I've found Amazon prices to be competitive with other stores so I continue to be an Amazon Prime Member.)<br /><br />If you only want one bottle, it may make sense to pay twice as much with free Amazon Prime shipping.

review/summary: It's ok, but it's no "Diet Coke"
review/text: As other reviews have mentioned, this pice is ridiculous.  However the product itself is decent.  I purchased this elsewhere because I love the taste of Diet Coke and read some reviews that  tastes just lke Diet Coke.  (My parents have had a soda fountain in their house since I was 2, I'm 31 now) ...  This tastes alot like Coke but no like Diet Coke(which makes sense, it doesn't use aspartame, it uses the sugar free sugar stuff)<br /><br />It is nice being able to make soda on demand though ...  I'm going to siphon some syrup from my parents and try that (if it works, you can get 5 gallon "bags" of Diet Coke from SAMs club, makes 35 gallons of soda)

review/summary: Are they kidding with the price?
review/text: Either I'm missing something and this is a double pack, which the description does not seem to support, or these people are insane.  There are loads of places to get this same product for $3.99, $4.99, even as high as $5.99.  What are they thinking?
