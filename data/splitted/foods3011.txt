review/text: This is my absolute favorite green tea! I love green tea for the way it makes me feel, but sometimes the flavor can be a little ehh. This has a sweet and fresh flavor. My grocery store had it for only a short while and then stopped carrying it. I was so excited to see it here online and for such a great price!!

review/summary: Great if it is the right flavor?
review/text: I love this tea and buy it in bulk but the last time I purchased 16 boxes and over half were flavored with anise and had a terrible licorice flavor. Apparently quality control is a problem. In addition I received peach tea flavored cherry and thou I love this tea and hate the thought of being without it, fear reordering it unsure of what I will receive, but if you are fortunate enough to actually receive what you ordered, their Golden Mango Tea is out of this world. Good Luck

review/summary: Wrong tea?
review/text: I likewise have my doubts that I got the right tea even though it says Golden Mango on the box and individual packages.  It does not remotely taste like mango and is somewhat bitter.  I can't identify the taste, but it ties for the worst tea I have ever tasted.  I find it odd since other reviewers have commented on how good it is with a real good mango flavor.  I don't know if I'm willing to try this again.  Others who have tasted it agree with my opinion and are unwilling to drink any more of it.

review/text: Like the others, I love this pasta for a side; goes great with anything!  Then suddenly, my huge grocery store that has everything doesn't carry it anymore,...WHY????  They always get rid of the best items,..makes me furious!  And they kept the Rice-a-Roni brand pasta that can't even compare to this one.  Go figure.  I'll buy it by the twelve pack then,..it will go fast.  It's awesome,...grill some shrimp and fresh veggies and serve this with it, along with a chilled glass of white wine,.....heaven!

review/text: This is a great pasta mix for a side dish. It is best to leave a little water in the pot when you drain it so the pasta doesn't get too dry; it tends to get a little drier after sitting for a few minutes. Sauce has a good flavor of parmesan and red pepper and the noodles are nice and delicate.

review/text: Like Stingraymo, I've been eating this pasta for a long time, but in the past year or so the grocery stores in my area have stopped carrying it. I haven't found anything as easy to make that I enjoy eating as much, so I'm ordering a 12-pack with the confidence that it will be consumed happily. For a meal-in-a-box, this pasta is terrific. It tastes great, isn't loaded with cheese and greasiness, and makes enough for two moderate servings. Yum, yum.

review/text: I have been searching for this pasta for about 6 yrs..ever since Safeway quit carrying it. I cannot find it anywhere locally and it is pretty expensive to order from manufacturer. This is a quick meal or side dish with lots of flavor and only takes about 15 minutes from start to finish.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer. They said they sell to distributors not directly to the grocery stores. The only way I might get it here is to talk to the store mgr. and request he order it. Yeah right!

You can use it as a side dish or as I've recently started doing, as a main dish by adding shrimp or chicken, etc.  One bit of advice, add more olive oil than the box says...about 2 1/2 to 3 tbsp's, so the pasta will better coated to accept and evenly distribute the seasoning.  I still can't believe more grocery stores don't carry this at all...they have all the Near East rice products, but not the pasta ones!

Maybe they sell out so fast they can't keep it stocked? Maybe the other readily-available Near East mixes just sit because everyone wants THIS one! I've never met anyone who didn't love it. Easy to prepare, always good quality, fun to augment. If Near East is listening, please don't ever stop producing it.

I was used to Oregon chai, and at first didn't like this as well, but after drinking this for a while and then returning to Oregon chai, I find that the Oregon is a lot sweeter. This chai has a nice blend of spices, not over peppery like Tazo. It's great cold as well, and I never have to worry about having milk on hand.

review/text: I love this Chai Tea. I've tried many others and this is one of the best. If you like having some spice in your life buy this tea. This is the best price I found unless it goes on sale at my local store and even then I only save about a quarter on each can. I've thought about making my own Chai but the ingredients are costly and this is much more convenient. The only negative I can think of is that when you've finished drinking a cup of this Chai there are some spices left in the bottom of the cup so unless you want some grit in your mouth you can't just chug down the last sip. My Chai Tea was delivered quickly and was well packaged and if your concerned about the expiration date (I was). My can's were dated 1 1/2 years from the day I received them. My six cans won't last me anywhere near that long. I drink this way more often than I probably should.

review/summary: Rare concentrate from organically grown blueberries.
review/text: Awesome product! Many are skeptical how naturally sweet this concentrate is, but if you take a bite of real blueberry and real cranberry, you'll notice right away how tangy cranberries are and how sweeter and much less tangy the blueberries taste, so comparing this concentrate to cranberry concentrate for the natural sweetness is not feasible. I'm quite this concentrate's sweetness is natural sweetness, as I'm very sensitive to the high fructose corn syrup in the drink. This blueberry concentrate is from organically grown blueberries, so a big higher price compared to others is understandable. I usually add 1/10th of glass and filled with water to drink. No need to add any more sweetness as it is naturally sweet as is. In our rural area, it's hard to come by organically grown blueberries, so this is product is great to compensate my problem!<br /><br />UPDATE on June 29, 2012<br /><br />Almost right after I posted this review, I noticed that the company stop listing "organically grown blueberries". Now it's listed "blueberries", and I assume they are no longer organic. It's too bad since this product was the only one that I know that was made organically. Don't the companies know we consumers want organic products especially when it comes to produce as listed as "dirty dozen" based on how pesticide contaminated!

I checked the website and it stated that the product is made from 100% blueberry concentrate.

review/summary: Sceptical
review/text: I was sceptical about this product because it tastes like no other unsweetened cranberry juice I've ever tried. Its syrupy, sweeter than other cranberry juices and has a grape juice taste to it. I contacted Dynamic Health and they say its 100% cranberry juice. I still feel a bit sceptical though. I'm used to Tree of Life brand so I think I'll just go back to it.

review/summary: Excellent, tart concentrated fruit juices
review/text: Excellent, tart concentrated fruit juices  4*<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the Da Frut concentrates on several counts.<br /><br />First is convenience, they can be kept on the shelf (instead of the freezer) until opened.<br /><br />Second, cost: locally, the passion fruit is the most expensive at about $3.50 / bottle -- but that mixes up to "at least" a gallon.  Other flavors run about $2, plus or minus, and make either a gallon or half gallon.<br /><br />Most important, they are unsweetened, leaving it to the customer to provide any extra sugar desired.  This is, of course, crucial for those trying to control their sugar intake, simply as calory control or because of diabetes, hyperactivity or other conditions.  But also it allows one to avoid the oversweetness of so many bottled juices on grocery store shelves, either due to the sugary apple / grape juice base or even added sweeteners.  If you choose to try any of the Da Fruta juices, I'd suggest you start with no added sugar and gradually add a few spoonfuls at a time (to that gallon or half gallon, not per serving!) until you reach your comfort zone.  I've been leaning toward the little-if-any sugar end of the spectrum lately, and find the result very refreshing and thirst quenching.  Of the two products I have in hand at the moment, the passion fruit has 2 g of sugars per serving (19 servings per container), and the cashew has 3 g of sugars.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't have freshly squeezed juices to compare these concentrates with, nor even any other equivalent products (such as bottled whole or frozen concentrate).  They are nothing like the heavily sweetened canned "nectars" that are available in some groceries.  Considered on their own, they are flavorful, tart and refreshing, and allow you to mix to the strength and sweetness desired.

review/summary: Highest Quality Food for Puppies and Underweight Dogs
review/text: I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Nutro Ultra brands I would highly recommend.

I discovered this product on Amazon and love it.  The seed seems to be as good as any I bought in a grocery store, and I was paying about 1/3 the cost of this for a tiny little jar - 0.9 ounces - that's 2.7 ounces for the same price as this 10-oz. jar!

Feed her that for 2 weeks (poor girl) then I got her on a raw diet that I make myself. Everything is great now and she loves it.  I recommend looking into a raw diet for your animals. Google "raw diets for dogs" you and your pets will be much happier!! Let's put all dog food companies out of business...

In coffee it is so-so, but it is fabulous to make those flavored water kids love so much, without adding sugar.

review/summary: Delicious Alternative to Sugar Products
review/text: In the interest of adopting a healthier lifestyle, I decided to decrease the amount of sugar and sugar products I was consuming. When it comes to the beverages I enjoy everyday, my morning coffee let the pack. I was addicted to those flavored coffee creamers that are delicious, but contain many things bad for the human body.<br /><br />This chocolate-raspberry liquid is delicious, and like all new food changes, did take some time for my taste buds to enjoy fully. Sugar is extremely sweet. My taste buds were used to that level of sweetness. So when I switched to this stevia liquid, at first, the subtle flavoring levels were not apparent. I use about a dropper full in every cup of coffee, although the instructions suggest a few drops. I may decrease the amount in the future, but for now, that amount satisfies my taste buds.<br /><br />Now that I've been using for about a month, I appreciate the delicious flavors, and have subscribed to auto-ship every month. For me, this was the perfect solution to my flavoring challenges.

A lot better than consuming disgusting amounts of sugar found in soda, pasteurized fruit juices and other "health" drinks like gatorade, capri suns, etc.

review/summary: NOT a Diabetic Friendly Food
review/text: This product contains Maltodextrin and so is NOT diabetic friendly. Maltodextrin reacts on blood glucose the same way as if you ingested table sugar. As per my physician: If you are diabetic, pre-diabetic or have a family history of diabetes you should AVOID maltodextrin.<br /><br />When I was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in January 2012, though I cut back my carb/sugar intake to no more than 20 grams per day, my blood sugar readings would frequently shoot up from within normal levels to either close to 200 or even over 200. I thought it was because my blood glucose meter was no good or something.<br /><br />The metformin I was taking caused gastric distress so I was on a clear liquid diet for a few days to clear that up. The diet consisted of water, low sodium, msg free chicken broth and sugar free jello. After I had been on the diet for almost 2 days, I had to go in for an additional lab. Since I thought my blood glucose meter was malfunctioning, I asked the lab to test my blood glucose and with the same blood sample, I used my meter to test. The lab test was 186 and my meter was 183. The head of the lab said that is very accurate for a home meter so why was my blood glucose so high????<br /><br />It turns out, it was from the sugar free jello that contains maltodextrin. It couldn't have been from the chicken broth or water and those were the only two other things I was ingesting. Later, my new physician confirmed that maltodextrin was definitely to be avoided.<br /><br />Once I cut out all products with maltodextrin in them from my diet, my blood glucose readings quickly normalized and have been normal ever since.<br /><br />Note that this product says it contains maltodextrin from CORN. Most people know that corn is a carbohydrate and is NOT a free food for diabetics. Because of how the law reads, manufacturers who include maltodextrin in their products do not have to count it as a carbohydrate or sugar in the nutritional information on the label they only have to list it in the ingredients.<br /><br />This page mentions that the American Diabetes Association and the American Dietetic Association says sugar free Jello is a "free" food and I don't know if those entities say that or not but it is NOT safe for diabetics and you can check with your diabetes educator or your endocrinologist to make sure but I'm absolutely POSITIVE that it spiked my own blood glucose REPEATEDLY. If you still doubt it, fast for a few hours, take your blood glucose reading, eat some of this Jello then wait 15-30 minutes and test again. I'm betting if you are like me - a non-insulin dependant diabetic - you'll see a spike in your blood glucose. How many spikes does it take before it affects your eyesight? Your kidneys? Your heart? Or before you get diabetic neuropathy? I don't mean to be an alarmist but if you have diabetes then you NEED to know what to avoid and those companies who tout their products as being diabetic friendly should have to tell the truth and be accountable. This is a DIET food but that does not make it suitable for diabetics.

All brands occasionally have stems, clumps of salt, and rancid seeds, but Gerbs seemed to have a lot more of them.  There were also a lot of seeds where the shell was already cracked, and the seed wasn't in there.  The flavor of the seeds that were in good condition was not bad, but also not the best peppered seeds I've had. If all the other brands were out of stock, I might buy these again, but they'd be my last choice.

review/summary: Maesri Red Curry Paste is teh Awesomes!
review/text: While looking for Best Spoon Red Curry I found Maesri Red Curry at the local Asian foods store and gave it a try.  A very smooth flavour with good heat, not gritty like another I tried.  Makes a delicious Red Curry Soup when adding coconut milk (half coconut milk to half water, otherwise a bit cloying), diced bean curd (firm), asparagus, broccoli, sliced carrot, sliced bell pepper, green peas and pineapple chunks (add a little pineapple juice, for sweet and spicy!)  I am The Curry Weasel and I positively writhe at the prospect of good curry.  Maesri makes it great curry!

review/summary: Now a mainstay at our house
review/text: I have to concur with another reviewer; this curry has become a favorite at our home. I have to admit I don't have the motivation to make my own Thai red curry, but I cannot imagine homemade being any better than this. This little can works magic when simply combined with a can of coconut milk, palm (or brown) sugar and a bit of nam pla (Thai fish sauce - We prefer Three Crabs or Golden Boy brands). Oh, don't forget fresh lime on the side or not. Or fresh cilantro or not. You get the picture? You can tweak the taste to match your own, but it's absolutely delicious standing alone with the coconut milk.<br /><br />But I must caution the 1:1 ratio is quite hot and spicy so 2 cans of coconut milk might be more suitable for a milder taste. Served with a side of jasmine rice, it's almost a cheaters way to make a exotic dinner.

review/summary: TOO MANY SUNFLOWER SEEDS but...
review/text: The picture displayed for this product is DECEIVING. I'm still looking for all those almonds and juicy looking raisins among other things in the picture. I found waaaay toooo many sunflower seeds for the price of this product. The sunflower seeds were good and fresh. I CANNOT cost justify buying this item. I won't purchase this again.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />My son rated this 3-Star because of all the seeds and their freshness, HE wants it again! I rated it 1-Star because of all the seeds. We split the difference and rated it 2-Star...to each their own.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I ordered AGAIN! The second order has the pictured blend of sunflower & pumpkin seeds, juicy raisins, almonds, cashew pieces all fresh. I'd give this batch 5 Stars. The inconsistent mixture in each order and price point makes it difficult to give the product more than 3-Stars.<br /><br />I'm addicted...I ordered TWO MORE TIMES and the mixture is more consistent with a great blend of ingredients.

UPDATE:  the first bag i opened was almost all sunflower seeds, and the others 'looked' the same.  but i just opened the second bag and found more of the raisins and other stuff inside.  maybe the sunflower seeds just settle to the outside of the package.  there are more sunflower seeds than whats in their marketing picture, but i think its a good value for the price.  i changed from 2 stars to 4.  i'll probably buy it again.

review/summary: Lighter Taste. Less Sweet. Suits My Needs Well.
review/text: A nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market sells a variety of prepared foods and a selection of somewhat exotic drinks that might go along with their meals. I enjoy trying them. last week I tried Honest Ade (Made by Honest Tea) Orange Mango drink and enjoyed it very much. Tonight I tried another flavor, Pomegranate Blue. It's certified USDA Organic. It comes in 16.9-ounce plastic bottles. It's low in calories, at about 100 per bottle, and they say it's sweetened "just a tad." I'd say both the flavor is light and the drink is only lightly sweet. I prefer the lighter taste and the less sweet drinks so this suits my needs well. It has very low sodium. It went real well with my meal. Excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I stumbled across this while in the juice aisle and since it was on sale, I bought a few bottles hoping that it would help in my quest to cut out the soda.  I was pleasantly surprised that I like this.  It doesn't have as many calories or sugar as soda and it's just sweet enough without being syrupy.  Now I buy a couple of bottles pretty much every shopping trip.

review/summary: Honest Ade Pomegranate Blue
review/text: I've drank the Honest brand products with mixed success.  Their lemonade left much to be desired, but this drink proved to be a little better.  And since I have a love hate relationship with pomegranate flavored things, I could be a little biased as well.  Sometimes they're fantastic, some times they're fairly lackluster.<br /><br />Pomegranate Blue is a flavored juice made from Pomegranates and Blueberries.  And it tastes most strongly of Pomegranates rather than the blueberries.  In fact, I didn't really taste the blueberries at all.  The pomegranate too was kind of muted, and this drink tasted like a watered down version of fruit juice.  It wasn't very sweet, which actually was ok because the bottle advertised that it was "just a tad sweet" so it lived up to that expectation.  Someone looking for a sugary kool-aid type product is probably not going to be fond of the taste of this product.<br /><br />The ingredients are healthy, which is good because that is what the Honest brand is known for.  It was a little disappointing that the juice is from concentrate, but at least its a healthier concentrate.  And a good portion of the ingredients were organic as well, which is always a plus.  The sweetener is organic cane sugar, so no nasty artificial sweeteners here.  Although I am a bit surprised that they didn't go for stevia in this drink.  And for those watching their diets, there's only a 100 calories in a 16.9 fl oz bottle.  For the juices, I was surprised to see that grape juice had a higher content than the pomegranate and blueberry juices, which was kind of disappointing since the name of the drink is Pomegranate Blue.<br /><br />Not a bad drink, but not one I'd seek out again either.  I'll keep giving the Honest brand a try, and hope that I run into a flavor I like.  They have good ingredients, but not so great taste most of the time.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/text: Great flavor, low sugar and  low calories (only 100 per bottle, not per serving).  I drink an Honest Ade nearly every day and I used to be hooked on much sweeter drinks like Dr. Pepper and Redbull. These are much healthier and more refreshing.<br /><br />It should be noted that while the flavor is great, it is pretty light. It is not a strong sugary flavor at all like many juices. I enjoy this, others may not.

review/summary: Honestly Little More Than Water
review/text: Not a whole lot of honest-to-goodness fruit in Honest Ade.  I tried them for the first time yesterday, and was disappointed by just about everything I saw and tasted.  It basically tastes like what you get when you finish drinking a glass of fruit juice, then drink water from the glass without rinsing it first.<br /><br />Although the bottle is labeled 16.9 ounces, I was disappointed to find, when I looked at the bottom of the bottle, that it is acutely concave and pushed in more almost two inches from the bottle's base; that is, it's one of those "secretly shrinking" packages that looks like it contains a larger quantity than it actually does.  A more honest 16.9-ounce bottle could have been about two inches shorter.<br /><br />Speaking of honesty, the top ingredients in this drink are water and sugar.  There is just enough pom and blueberry juice to color the water a light purple, and no more.  There's virtually no nutritional value to the drink, so the pom and blueberry are not in high enough quantities to provide any antioxidants.<br /><br />If you are looking for the benefits of pomegranate and blueberries, buy 100% real juice, and drink that.  Then, when you're done drinking it, you can fill up the glass with water and a little sugar, and pretty much get Honest Ade for free.

review/summary: BBQ Sauce Guru Says... 5 Stars!
review/text: I review BBQ Sauces at [...]... here is my review for this sauce.<br /><br />[...]<br />Clearly marketed towards big loud chopper owners, the references aren't too strong enough to turn off those of us who aren't bikers.<br /><br />How many references to Harley's can you find on this bottle? I found 5<br />The manufacturer describes this as "an aggressive, crimson-red, tomato-based sauce riddled with spices you can see, smell and taste," and I'd agree.<br /><br />This sauce was easily the best of a recent batch of three random varieties I just got in. The consistency was thin yet stable and clung to the meat well. There was just enough heat (provided by cayenne peppers) to really add life to really tasty set of wings. This one really is unique in that it provides the three major BBQ flavors: sweet, spicy, and sour (tangy). If you are looking for something that tastes slightly different, has no preservatives, and supports really loud forms of transportation - this one is for you!<br /><br />Smell: Nice with a very natural scent.<br /><br />Taste: Sweet, sour, and a dab of spicy. Unique, yet not overpowering.<br /><br />Consistency: One tiny nit is that it pours a little thin, but you can really see the spices as they flow out of the bottle and into intermediate basting container... and it clings well to ________ (insert favorite meat here).<br /><br />Packaging: Fun "Harley-marketing", but cheap plastic bottle. Guess it's good if you're like me with a kid or kids running around grabbing everything they can!<br /><br />One of my highest reviews and faves so far.<br /><br />Ingredients: Tomato sauce, prepared mustard, brown sugar, cayenne peppers, vinegar, natural smoke flavor, salt, spices, xanthan gum.<br /><br />Nutrition Info: 25 calories per 28g serving, 0g fat, 5g carbs, 240mg sodium

review/summary: OK in a pinch
review/text: My yeast do not like this ME compared to the ME I get from a large, Midwestern homebrew supply company that ships it in 6lb milk-jug style containers.. Even at 50% mixed with the other ME, there is a HUGE lag for fermentation to start. Using the Midwestern ME by itself, the same yeast strain (US-05) and culture (same aeration protocol, too) started vigorous fermentation within a few hours. Doing another batch with 50% Cooper's ME, it took just over over 3 days(!) for fermentation to start, and then it took about 12 hours for it to really get going. I'm not sure why this is so, but I would be inclined to guess that the Cooper's product used barley that was fairly heavily sprayed with chemicals which inhibited the yeast. Since they claim not to add anything to the finished product, and since it still shows the effect even when mixed with other ME, this is my best guess..
