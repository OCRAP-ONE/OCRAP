review/summary: Great value
review/text: Great price for the amount of avocado oil you get.  You really won't find anything else cheaper.  And pretty bottle too.  It would make a nice gift.  I use the oil to make homemade mayo--it has a very mild taste so the mayo tastes like mayo.  It's not at all like using olive oil.  And it's a lot healthier than sunflower, canola, corn, and vegetable oil.  I'll definitely be ordering some more soon!

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: I am very happy with this, though next time I will buy it in the plastic bottles(<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OMKOSW">Massimo Gusto Extra Virgin Avocado Oil, 1 Liter Bottles (Pack of 2)</a> ) because it's cheaper.<br /><br />It is great for deep frying. You can get the oil really hot so things cook quicker and are less greasy when done. I've done battered flounder, potatoes, mushrooms and beer-batter onion rings, all with great results. I'm kind of new to the deep fry, I've avoided it in the past because the oils are generally not very healthy. Avocado oil is healthy, like olive oil, but you can't get olive oil hot enough to deep fry without smoking up the kitchen and making the oil bitter. No problem with the avocado oil. Highest smoke point of any commercially available oil. I've had it up over 450F with no smoke at all.<br /><br />I also make a balsamic/garlic/herb vinaigrette, and I made it with this oil. It was very good, better, IMO, that with olive oil.<br /><br />So far, the only thing I've with it that I didn't care for was aioli. There is a butterry-sweet undertone to the avocado oil that didn't belong, and there is a tangy aspect to olive oil that was missing. So, I'll be sticking with olive oil for the aioli.<br /><br />The price for this or it's plastic-bottled equivalent makes it possible for me to make it a regular part of my cooking. At the local grocery stores, most don't have it, and if they do it's like $16 for a 6 to 8 ounce bottle, so I just never tried it before, though I wanted to.<br /><br />I hope this company will keep the quality up and the price down. If they do I'll be a regular customer. Seriously, in the next month or two I am buying a dedicated fry pot and some more of this oil, and I'm going to start deep-frying on a regular basis.

review/summary: Please with Purchase
review/text: I have been making an effort to eat more healthfully this year, and had done allot of reading about using the various "good" oils in cooking. Avocados are one of my favorite foods, so I wanted to try avocado oil. Not finding it in my local stores (why did I ever move to a rural place???), Amazon, once again, came to the rescue.<br /><br />The oil arrived well packaged! No danger of breakage here!<br /><br />I love the taste of the avocado oil and have used it in cooking and salad dressings. The best thing I have used it for is making a focaccia-style flax seed bread. It added a nice flavor that the recipe needed. It is also very nice for sauteing vegetable in a stir fry.<br /><br />The price through Amazon was no worse than good quality olive oil.

review/summary: Best All Purpose Cooking oil!
review/text: I bought this to use for frying and sauteing because of its higher smoke point. This oil, when I did the math ended up costing about as much as extra light olive oil, and its much, much safer to use. The bottles are glass, so there is no plastic leakage, and the oil is sublime! I hardly every use olive oil any more- why would I, when this does every and more, and it tastes amazing as well! I noticed that literally everything I cook tastes better when I use avocado oil- better than butter, in most cases!<br /><br />I've ordered it 3 times so far. Each time the bottles were a bit different, and I liked the addition of the spout thing, but I was sad to get a clear bottle instead of the darker ones- the darker bottle protects the oil from sun damage better. I'm hoping the next batch I order (because I will be ordering more) will have the darker bottles again.<br /><br />LOVE THIS STUFF.

review/summary: I really wanted to like this product
review/text: This seemed like such a great deal in terms of price and smoke point that I already imagined myself making it my default cooking oil. Both bottles arrived on time and in good condition, but alas the oil smelled and tasted rancid. I really advise everybody to give it a taste before using in cooking. I tried it several times because I just couldn't believe I ended up with 2 liters of unusable oil. I guess it was too good to be true. The only silver lining is that customer service was amazing (as other reviews indicate), gave me a call hours after I posted my feedback, and eventually refunded the purchase. This is the only reason why I did not give the product 1 star.

review/text: Like this avocado oil so much I've ordered it twice and will order it again when I run out. It  has a nice mild flavor and really works well for higher heat cooking such as stir fry.  I also use it to improve my dogs fur quality.  A couple of eggs cooked in avocado oil every 2 to 4 weeks really makes his coat soft.  It does come in the dark green bottles as the picture shows.  As other reviewers have commented it comes packaged in plenty of bubble wrap and arrives fairly quickly.  A great product at an excellent price.

review/summary: Decent-tasting sesame oil
review/text: Aside from the fact that sesame oil is absolutely the most divine tasting oil, I have to hand it to this product. It tastes pretty fresh and has a rich nutty sesame oil taste and the texture is a teeny bit thick and wonderful. I like that it is organic and it is only medium refined which hopefully makes you think less chemicals were used in the refining process. I do wish they would give you more details about the refining process, storage history, freshness and any chemicals used in their oil. I think you are partially guessing here. Unrefined sesame oil is divine and tastes a little richer and more "meaty" than highly refined. To me it is kind of like the difference between whole wheat bread and white bread (though not so striking). Unrefined does not seem as smooth-tasting as a refined oil, and may have more of a distinct taste in recipes, whereas the refined sesame oil is more subtle and may blend in better with your other ingredients. However, I love this oil and if you want the sesame aspect to be the "star" of your dish this oil will add a lot.

review/summary: The BEST Chai Tea your tastebuds will ever experience!
review/text: I liked Chai Tea...that is until I tried Big Train Chai Tea.  It is  truely the best blend of spices with tea ever made! I've had Chai Tea at Starbucks, Borders, Jidders, Fry's Supermarket,...and other coffee houses, they were good, until I tried Big Train given to me by my sister.  The first time I tried it, it was like tasting "heaven"!  It's really that GOOD!<br /><br />Trust me, try it, and you'll be glad you did.  The taste is superb.  Simply mix it with water, real easy.  I drink mine double the amount suggested on the bag, ah....truely yummy.<br /><br />I must admit I love it so much, I only drink it while on vacation and holiday's as I drink it too much and am weight conscious.  However it really make my vacations and holidays special.<br /><br />The best tasting of all the Big Train brand I have found is the Spiced Chai and the Spiced Decaf Chai.  The others taste a little odd to me.  Of the two mentioned, I prefer the decaf, it has a smoother taste and I can drink it at night, whereas the other will get me awake for hours.  That being said, when I need to clean my house or yard, the Spice Chai is perfect, gives me a real lift.<br /><br />Buy Big Train Chai, it is simply the Best Chai Tea you'll ever drink!!!

review/summary: Might just be the best chai EVER
review/text: So I basically always choose Oregon Chai and it was good. Then I found Oregon Chai instant which for some reason was WAY better than the concentrate versions (no sour aftertaste I got from the others). Every chai I've ever tasted after was never as good. So when Amazon was out of stock of my instant (original flavor in the purple box is the best), I decided to try out Big Train (based on reviews). It was the review that stated "even better than Oregon Chai" that sealed the deal - I had to try it.<br /><br />It arrived within the week and I tried it right away. It says you can make it with water or milk but I always prefer water (milk makes to too thick for my liking). It tasted very good, but also completely differently from any other chai I've ever had. So it was actually very hard for me to compare. So after a few mugs, it hit me. It was missing the cardamom/cinnamon flavors that I'm used to in chai. So I added 1/8 tsp of cinnamon and OMG, it was AMAZING. Way better than any other chai I've had!<br /><br />I choose the 12oz three pack (instead of the 1.9 lb 2pack) just to try it out since I didn't want to be stuck with an even larger amount if I didn't end up liking it. But you'll go through these bags fast because it uses 4 tablespoons per 8oz cup! I'm already down to my last bag and it's only been 2 weeks. I haven't tried any of the other flavors (just the spiced chai flavor), but I highly recommend this one!

review/text: I've sampled several different chai mixes before, but Big Train Spiced Chai Mix is definitely the best. It has a distinct smell and taste, very sweet, but still has a bit of that tea flavor. Whenever I make a cup, the first reaction I get is, "Wow, that smells like Christmas!"<br /><br />I would recommend the "spiced" flavor, because that's the only one I've tried and I loved it. Got some for my friends as gifts and they love it too! Also, it was convenient that the drink came in three smaller bags, so you can give each one as gifts or keep them for yourself!! But if you plan on drinking a cup each day, or every other day, I would suggest buying the larger canisters because these go quickly!

review/text: For Christmas this year, my daughter specifically requested Big Train Chai. When she was little, I used to take her and her brother out to the coffee shop. We would drink Chai and listen to live music or play games. It was always a great time. I only had summer visitation so we made the most of it, and when they returned to their father's for the school year, I would send her a bag of Big Train Chai as a christmas present. That was about 10 years ago but some things you don't forget. This year, she told me that she wanted chai, and not just any chai, but the stuff in the purple bag that I used to send her when she was young. I shipped her two bags and kept one for myself, so that I can drink something delicious that brings back so many wonderful memories.

I had to use 6 tablespoons in order to taste the flavor. I don't know about the other reviewers, but I personally won't be buying this again. Big Train can pull out the station, I'm taking the bus!

I typically use the concentrated liquid chai that you mix with water or milk, so this was a different world to me.  But once I had some, I never wanted the liquid anymore!  The flavor is so good, it's fairly easy to make - you can mix it with hot water or milk - I prefer milk, but that's your own preferance.  Definitely good sized bags that are resealable, which is the best selling point ever.  I will definitely be buying these again since they are very hard to find in stores near me!

review/summary: Awesome product
review/text: I picked a pack of these up locally.  Kind of pricey compared to other chews but at the same time worth the price.  My opinion is that this is kind of a hybrid of gum and a chew; when you first put it in your mouth it has the consistency of gum but the flavor of a chew in the center.  Great feel if you're a gum chewer and much softer than starburst and now & later which is better for dental work.<br /><br />Only drawbacks are the price and the fact that the US is getting domesticated flavors.  In Asia they have some very interesting flavors like Cola and Lemon drop soda which sound like they'd be a decent product for the US.  Maybe if they sell enough here they'll expand their product line to more "exotic" flavors.

review/text: I really enjoy the Hi-chews except in Mango.  I was happy to see this offered in grape so imagine my disappointment when I tasted a very, very strong chemical taste in these.  I would compare it to nail polish remover.  I contacted the seller with my concern but was ignored.  Don't buy the GRAPE!!<br /><br />I had to rate this with 1 star otherwise my review wouldn't go through, but I take it back.

review/text: Found the sweets i've been looking for in Turkish Delights!  The texture of this confection is similar to some of my favorites, but these were even better and is now one of my all time favorites; it's a soft gummy texture with just enough bite.  The rose flavor is piquant and exquisite.

It came quickly and it was very delicious. I wasn't sure what rose-flavored would taste like but I loved it. It was fresh and very delicious. I can see why Edmund was so tempted with it, now.

review/summary: This Stuff Is Great!
review/text: A while back, I ordered one of each of every tea-tree foot/body powder I could find, to try them all out. I was looking for a natural alternative to the various anti-fungal medicated powders I'd been using for athletes-foot and jock-itch.<br /><br />On first glance I was unimpressed by this product. It's rather plain looking, and the label is even kinda wrinkled up like it was badly glued onto the cardboard tube.<br />HOWEVER, after evaluating all of the powders, this one is BY FAR my favorite one!<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice is that it doesn't poof clouds of powder everywhere. Secondly, it has a pleasant tea-tree oil scent - not too strong - just right. It does an excellent job of cooling, relieving itch, and healing and preventing chafing.<br /><br />It is labeled as foot powder, and it does that job well, but it's great for an allover body powder - not too strong even for the "sensitive" areas!

review/summary: viable replacement for Special Teas brand
review/text: This Vithanakande Estate OP1, packaged by TeaVert, is the first I've tried as a replacement for the Special Teas branded Vithanakande (Special Teas was bought out by TeaVana & unfortunately, Special Teas best teas were not continued by TeaVana).  Vithanakande was one of the very best.<br /><br />This one from TeaVert is quite good, but lacks some of the smooth richness of my previous favorite.  That being said, I am also aware there can be differences from season to season. I would purchase this one again, unless I came across one that I liked better.  Anyone who likes to try different teas should definitely add this one to his or her list, perhaps at the top as the next to try.  Contrary to their instructions, I steep this one for only 3 minutes in my Krups tea maker, along with a small ice cube to lower the temp just a little.  It is also quite refreshing cold.

It's both classy and sexy and icons of a more romantic era.  While it's not the most superb matcha or the most interesting, you simply can't go wrong with Royal Matcha.  It's a comforting and energizing drink for the morning, and if you're immune to caffeine, this makes a great latte for dessert after dinner.  Like I said, you can't go wrong with this.

review/summary: Excellent Coffee if You Like Dark, Strong and Robust
review/text: I like my coffee dark, strong, bold and black, no sweeteners, no cream.  This is thus an ideal coffee for me.  If you like a much milder coffee, say medium roast, you may not like it nearly as much as I do. If you like cream and sugar, that may just ruin this coffee as it will dilute its strength and "strong" is what this coffee is all about..  The statements made in the description of this coffee here at Amazon are correct, i.e. the taste of an Italian roast with hints of chocolate overlaying it. Lately I've been able to buy mine at Sam's Club locally in a big bag for $16.

review/text: This is my favorite coffee of all time!  It's just perfect.  Not too strong and not too weak.  I've tried many and this is the one I always grab.  Of course you must buy the whole bean and grind it yourself because it will always taste a million times better.  I don't find the price to be a problem at all compared to other coffee brands.  I do always make sure to get it on sale AND if you happen to have a Kroger nearby you can usually get a bag for around $7.00 which if (like me)  you have a husband who doesn't do coffee, it'll last you at least two weeks! :D

review/summary: Prepare yourself for a rich coffee experience.
review/text: Starbucks Caffe Verona is one of the most full-bodied, aromatic coffees sold by Starbucks.  It can be enjoyed at any time of day, but it is best served to late-afternoon guests or after dinner with dessert.  To anyone familiar with the rich aroma of coffee beans roasting, this coffee tastes like that smell.  Few cups are as fraught with flavor and richness as Caffe Verona, short of a well-crafted macchiato.<br /><br />In spite of its boldness, this coffee manages to retain its distinctive characteristics.  Where some of the darker roasts tend to become uniform and mundane, Caffe Verona is unmistakably unique and memorable.  Its flavor and aroma linger long after you have finished the cup.<br /><br />Whether you are the kind of person who gets hooked on one coffee, or if you like to try different kinds, this pack of three is simply a great deal.  If you truly, truly enjoy coffee, I can almost guarantee you will enjoy Caffe Verona.

review/summary: Good company, but this is not one of their better products
review/text: Dixie's "Plain Bread Crumbs" is a poor product.  It tasted sour when used to coat some breaded skinless boneless chicken breasts (with an egg wash as a binder), and did not hold texture at all in frying or baking (as a baking coating it got pretty soggy).  We tried it in a meatloaf recipe as well, and it added a strange sour, almost bitter, aftertaste to it.  This is simply not a good product to my taste buds.  The only reason I did not give it a 1 is that some people's tastes may vary, and the company itself did a good job on order fulfillment.<br /><br />If you're looking for crumbs, you're better off buying Dixie's "Bakes Quick" biscuit mix, then making biscuits and then making crumbs from those.  Its what I did before, and what I will do from now on.<br /><br />If you're looking for a frying coating/batter, go with Dixie's "Batter and Coating" mix - its a far better product.  I use it frequently.<br /><br />Sorry Dixie, in my opinion, this one's a loser.

review/text: My son had this Jablum roasted and ground coffee brought back from Jamaica and paid a lot for it.  I have drunk blue mountain for years when I can but this was shocking.  It tasted stale when you opened the bag and even worse when you drank it.  It was definitely off.  He bought 5 bags and every one we tried was the same.  I would never buy another.  We had bought another brand in a tin from Jamaica which was fine.  I think this is a con.  You get all the rubbish about it being tested in Jamaica, well I dont know who tests it but definitely not someone who likes good coffee.  I just dont understand how people say its any good. Maybe having paid so much for it its like the emperor's new clothes.

review/summary: Excellent coffee, not all that exotic, though...
review/text: I love my coffee, and because of that, I have tried lots and lots of varieties although I began as a simple Folgers fantatic.  Jamaican Mountain Blue Coffee has been touted to be the best of the best world coffees out there by such highly esteemed sources as the Food Network and the kitchens of the White House.<br /><br />I found the low acidity of the coffee very refreshing, but the darkness of this roast has not allowed a lot of subtleness of the flavor to come out.  To me, this tastes like Folgers at its best, but nothing more than that.  Great for everyday drinking, because it is smooth and rich and leaves little acid "bite."  But still, after having tried Kona coffee with its myriad of subtle flavors, I found Blue Mountain kinda boring.<br /><br />I guess I disagree with experts, but hey, my coffee is important and taste is everything!  If you like exotic flavors, this isn't it.  But it you would like to have consistently smooth, rich, honest coffee, this is the one.

review/summary: Blue Mountain Experience
review/text: I am a coffee lover of many years and as such am always interested in finding good coffees.  This was my first time to try blue mountain, and purchasing it with a gift certificate allowed me to be a bit more extravagant than I otherwise would have been.<br /><br />While the coffee is good, I don't find it to be superior to other coffees I have ordered which are considerably less expensive.

review/summary: Love Blue Mountain Coffee, Hate JABLUM
review/text: While in Jamaica, my wife and I drank Blue Mountain Coffer every day and loved it.  We even went on a bike tour of the Blue Mountains, and purchased some coffee.  It came in a plain clear plastic bag, and we could see the darkness of the roast.  We enjoyed that coffee.<br /><br />In Ocho Rios, we bought some bags of JABLUM.  You can't see the darkness of the roast, and all you can smell is the burlap bag.  When we opened it up, it was a very light roast, not much fragrance, and once brewed, the coffee tasted a lot like dirt.  We were very disappointed.

review/text: Went to Jamaica last May and brought about 6 pounds of this and the Waldenford's Blue Mtn back with me. About half what you are paying here, but still not worth the money. It is good coffee. No question. But don't believe all the hype. I am a casual coffee drinker and someone that takes coffee more seriously might get more benefit from this coffee. To me, not the case. I order my Peet's Arabian Mocha Java online for about $14/lb and it is still my favorite coffee.

review/text: After getting an email from Amazon noting that this coffee was on a closeout sale at 40% off the regular price, I stumbled on an additional 20% off coupon. A 60% discount?? Too good to be true, but it all worked!<br />Even if the coffee was a touch above average, I'd be well satisfied. It was terrific. I bought a few "on-sale" varieties from Camano Island Coffee Roasters, vacuum packed them, and put them in my freezer. A great buy on excellent coffee.

review/summary: too sweet
review/text: I grew up in a polish american home with pork and cabbage a favorite.  Every Tuesday we would visit my Grandmother before we were all school age, as  it was Dads payday and the day Grandma made spare ribs and sauerkraut. The were braised and not browned before and so good.  However I failed to see the sugar in the label for this product.  If you are like me the sweet kills it!  It was sugar on the tongue why why why?  I bought it put,the pork and the canned kraut in the crockpot and  after it was done cooking was what what sugar!!  Granted its a little sugar I guess compared to lots of convience products plus I am not Bavarian cuisine by birth.  But watch out on all labels for sugar if you don't added it yourself cause if they do they ruined your dish by your tastes.  I have had other dishes unpalateable to me because a canned ingredient had sugar i didn't expect and this product does.  Only a little sugar can kill a good dish when others expect it'  That's not what i expect to happened to me.  Cause of added but  possibly authentic to you- minuscule sugar which I quess a lot of like but wow bad to me  I won't buy again.

The flavor is very mild, yet still has that wonderful<br />old time flavor I remember as a child.

review/summary: So-so poultry gravy mix
review/text: I've only tried it once so far, but it seems to be lacking in flavor and you can't discern what type of poultry it is - although it doesn't have a turkey taste - closer to an extremely mild chicken.  I was hoping for a little more intense flavor than what I got.<br /><br />I do like the Southeastern Mills version (actually all of their flavors are good), but cannot seem to find it in a frugal size (just the small couple ounce packets for more than $1).  A 2 pound version of that at a reasonable price would be great.

review/text: My rather fussy little dog will generally only eat people food and turns her nose up at most dog food. I've tried several brands of natural and organic dog treats with her and she's only liked two brands, one of which is Wagatha's. Of the two brands, I prefer to give her Wagatha's Senior Biscuits because I think the ingredients are better (no sugar, etc.). These organic "senior" biscuits seem especially healthy, with turmeric, flax seed, ginger, rosemary, thyme, veggies, lentils, etc. They are also wheat-free and all of the organic ingredients are U.S. sourced (except for the olive oil).

review/summary: said to be produced without slavery; helpful product, no fructose corn-syrup' and  tastes great
review/text: Lucky to find this "true and authentic hot cocoa mix". I was looking for cocoa mixes without corn syrup or dry milk.  Think I've found it in this product.<br />The Omanhene organization has a website under that name, and the package label says the company works out of the state of Wisconsin.<br />The label has lots of very interesting facts, such as:<br /><br />A) "In a unique process, our beans are fermented between banana leaves and dried in the warm African sun.  Then we roast, grind and press the beans to extract the finest natural cocoa powder available anywhere....."<br />B). "Omanhene" (OH -mahn-HEE-nee) comes from the Twi language and is the title for the traditional king or chief, the repository of ethical and moral authority in Ghana."<br /><br />We've tried this at our house both with milk and with water, and thought it very good tasting, sugar not overpowering.<br />Our order was a pack of four, 12  ounces each, nice seal under the plastic lid.<br />Some nutrition facts are:  14 servings of 2 tbsp each per 12 ounce-container...<br />Which works out to: 80 calories per serving,<br /> 5 calories fat, zero transfat, zero saturated fat, and 0.5 gram of fat<br />Zero cholesterol;<br /> 5 mg sodium. (Low)<br />20 grams carb<br /> 2 grams fiber<br />16 grams sugar<br /> 1 gram protein<br />Mixing directions are on the label.  Again, lucky to have this alternative to corn syrup, dry milk, and standard cocoa mixes.  Recommended, and hope you like this, too.
