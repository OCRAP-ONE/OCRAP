review/summary: wonderful treat but doesn't last as long as other rawhide
review/text: My 30 pound puppy goes crazy for these, he really loves them.  He's just in heaven when he's chewing on one of these, but they only last about 20 minutes.  If you're looking for something that lasts much longer than a biscuit but doesn't need to last for hours like other rawhide treats then this is perfect.

review/summary: Dog loves them - but are they safe?
review/text: These are a great price and seem to be a high-quality product.  They have a very smoky scent and the dog seems to love the taste.  However, the ends are chewed off pretty easily and leave a mouth-sized potential choking hazard.  It really depends on whether your dog is simply a chewer or if they try and swallow things before they are broken up into smaller pieces.  I definitely keep a close eye on my pet when I give her one of these.

review/text: These are good bones, and the dogs like them, but they have to stay outside. If you give one to your dog indoors, when the dog is done it will look like a buffalo exploded in the middle of your living room. I've bought other real bones before, which aren't nearly as cheap as these, and never had that problem.

review/text: These are pretty good sized bones and my labs just loved them. There is some smoked meat left on the bone which was a real treat but what I really liked about them was the fully cooked bone was totally edible. One of my pups is a very agressive chewer and he still got several hours of enjoyment from one bone.<br />Give your dog a real natural bone treat they are great for their teeth.

review/summary: Save the shoes!
review/text: My three dogs all love these bones. My vet says that rawhide is not good for dogs. These are natural bones, which I normally pay twice the price for at the local pet shop. And they're ALOT cheaper than new shoes.<br />They will leave them around the house for several days, which is alright, because after they initially chew the flavor off, the bone stays dry and clean. They pick them up from time to time and chew for awhile. It keeps them busy, and is good for their teeth. Just try to not listen, it sounds like their teeth are breaking.<br />This is a great bargain.

My male bullmastiff chewed threw 1 bone in about five minutes.  An expensive lesson.

review/text: These bones are great for LARGE dogs. I bought these for my small dogs thinking 8 inches was not so big. Boy was I wrong! They were so big for my 2 small dogs that when I gave them one they just looked up at me like "you've got to be kidding"! They could not even pick it up. I gave them to a friend who has a very large dog and that was a good fit.

review/summary: Good value for the dollar
review/text: I don't know why I'm writing this review, shouldn't it be the dogs who review this? If so, I think my dog would give it a 5. Then again considering she likes to eat used socks, she's not exactly picky about what she chews on.<br /><br />From my dogs point of view, these bones are great. She'll sit and devour it as soon as I give it to her. From my point of view, these bones are probably a bit too small/weak for her. She's a 75lbs german shepherd. And she'll have the bone in pieces within 15 minutes or so. But, she'll sit and chew on the pieces for 1-3 hours. And she'll come back later and chew on them a bit afterwards as well. They do however make a mess on the floor. Bits of bone on the floor and bits of meat/skin as well. So be prepared to do a little cleanup afterwards. After she's finished that initial chew session, the bones are pretty clean though and wont leave any further mess.<br /><br />However, they are a really good value for the price. So if you don't want to spend more money for a bigger/thicker bone, I'd go with these.

However, she can be a bit picky about her bones but the 8 inch Smokehouse bones she absolutely loves!  There's lots of meat on the bone and they keep her busy few a couple hours.  The bones are very greasy so be prepared to have some place for you dog to chew these.  I typically put her in her kennel until she gets it down to the nub. Outside would be best but still too cold for that.  I keep a bag on hand at all times!

review/summary: Dieters Beware! These Are Awesome!
review/text: I shop for groceries at a nearby Fresh and Easy store. They're a British company and carry a lot of imported items, particularly things from England. I've discovered their European candies. My wife is from Russia and has also lived in London and she says that European candies are better than American. Boy, is she right! In any  case, the latest item for me to pick up is a roll of Rowntrees Fruit Pastilles. They're little round discs, about the size of a nickel but about twice as thick, and are covered with somewhat coarsely granulated sugar crystals. They're not particularly sweet, I should add. Inside is a tough, very chewy candy. The flavor is not overly strong, unlike American things of this kind, but is soft and subtle and very, very good. A roll of these has three or four different flavors within it. Boy, are these things good. Gracious! I start out with the idea of having one or two, but the whole roll is gone in no time. Ummmmm. Beware if you're on any kind of a diet. These things are awesome!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I have to tell you, I have been a fan of spicy food for the last 20 years. I have tried wicked salsas, and crazy-hot sauces. I thought I had seen it all until I received Dave's Total Insanity as a gift last Christmas.<br /><br />I arrived home from work and decided to give this sauce a try. We were having rice for dinner, and I launched a generous topping of Dave's Total Insanity into the mix, and dug in.<br /><br />Oh, my! This stuff was no hot I had to throw out the whole dinner. I put way too much in. I never expected "nuclear meltdown." Friends, this stuff isn't child's play. Heck, I wouldn't even secretly put it in my enemy's food. I might get arrested.<br /><br />Dave's Total Insanity has a great taste, and is perfect for the spicy food lover in your life, but don't go slathering it on your pile of chicken wings until you have a small taste first. You will waste a meal unless you use it in moderation.

review/summary: Delightful flavor with intense burn
review/text: I've enjoyed Dave's Total Insanity for over a decade now. It's by far my number one favorite hot sauce of all time.<br /><br />Dave's Gourmet makes a variety of "Insanity" themed hot sauces including "Temporary Insanity", "Ultimate Insanity", and more. But of them all, "Total Insanity" has the best flavor to my palate. Dave's Total Insanity has strong overtones of garlic which I really like combined with a tangy lime hit but just a touch of smokiness. The overall flavor profile is just divine.<br /><br />Then the burn hits.<br /><br />And what a burn! It's terrifyingly powerful, inducing screams, dizziness, tears, and more. The endorphin rush from Dave's Total Insanity is absolutely the bomb. I eat more and more, unable to stop this coaster-ride of fantastic flavor and furious fire. I sweat, I cry, I shudder, I double over, and then I hit that pain-induced high and I just float as the room spins away.<br /><br />Thanks, Dave.

review/summary: Very hot, taste good too. 357 collectors edition still the hottest hot sauce
review/text: I am not a fan of hot sauce. My brother is the crazy one in our family who loves hot sauce, he eats red hot small chili peppers too. Anyway, I have been trying to find a hot sauce for him where he would eventually say "yup, its really HOT". Found this one and sent it to him. According to him, this is really hot and taste good too. He says he rates it a 5 star.<br />Found another hot sauce for him 357 Mad Dog Collectors Edition and sent it to him to try. Oh boy, almost got him a hospital visit. He said he thought he was going to pass out from the fire in his mouth and throat. I did warn him that it has 6million scoville and that it was suppose to be hot, well he finally said that this was the hottest hot sauce ever. He only uses a drop or 2 of this and he said he uses 1/2 teaspoon on Daves Total insanity if he uses it. Daves taste better, and hands down on 357.<br />Sorry, cant really do a personal review on this, I would probably go to the hospital if I get a drop of Daves and funeral on 357.  :-)

Once this was mixed in, I could barely eat it.  I honestly don't know if it has a flavor, but it definitely serves its purpose, by allowing me to add heat to the sauces I buy.  When it runs out, I'll definitely buy another.

review/text: I really like spicy food, so when a friend got this for me as a gift, I was thrilled. I love it! Use EXTREME caution when adding it to food, though--just two or three little drops will add a really nice kick to a big bowl of soup. A little goes a loooooong way. I can tell I'll be enjoying this product for a long time to come.<br /><br />It's got a nice garlicky aroma, but unfortunately, not much of the garlic flavor comes through in the food, since you have to use so little at a time. The texture is very thick. It's very easy to add to saucy foods like chili, stir-fry, or stew, but it may be difficult to add as a condiment to burgers or sandwiches. I'd recommend mixing it in with something milder first.

Every cat there is cared for very well and this food adds to the diets of some.  Most, except one diabetic, inhale it.  So they must like it.  My own cat (16) just loves the Shreds in this brand because she likes the gravy in it.  I've only fed her this brand so why change horses in mid stream?

They smell fresh and not too disgusting, so the product is okay - it just depends on your cat's tastes. Recommend, but try to get it somewhere else because I only pay about $.36/can.

I don't know if she has bad teeth or just wants her food the temperature of a dead critter. However she will eat any of the pates and thats a miracle.

review/summary: Not the greatest quality
review/text: My order was sold by Deeva Fulfillment Services, Inc. and fulfilled by Amazon.<br /><br />The cardamom was very roughly ground, full of threads throughout, and not very potent.  So, you can get the wonderful cardamom flavor from it, but you have to use a lot more to do so, defeating the value of the great price.  And you'll be left with some tough "husk" shreds in your mouth.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: Nature's Hollow preserves surpass my expectation of a sugar-free product (and I have a demanding palate). They taste delicious and are easy to cook and bake with. I have fed it to my neices and nephews and they preferred my jam on their toast to the other national (sugar-filled) store brands. For any one on a sugar-restricted diet or those trying to decrease the amount of sugar they intake, this is the product you should be purchasing. (note: you can find these jams for less at whole foods markets. Plus, they have the occasional sale)

review/summary: They Killed the Necco!
review/text: These are far from the "original" Necco Wafers.  Some genius decided it would be a good idea to replace the artificial colors and flavors generations of Necco lovers have come to adore with things like beet juice, cabbage, and turmeric.  The result of the switch to "natural" flavorings and colors is, at best, disappointing, at worst, an unmitigated confectionery disaster.<br /><br />The black Necco, with its sweet quasi-licorice flavoring, was always my favorite.  Now, it's hard to tell it apart from the other Neccos.  There are only mild differences between the flavors of these false Neccos, these fraudulent wafers.  And all the flavors are forgettably bland.<br /><br />The New England Confectionery Company has ditched the old packaging, too.  In a way, the change is a blessing.  The new wrapper lets the Necco lover know not to waste money on the worst product formula change ever.  Forget New Coke/Old Coke; the Necco debacle is unequaled in world history. It makes the Portland Trailblazer's decision to draft Sam Bowie instead of Michael Jordan seem enlightened.<br /><br />What makes the whole sordid affair even harder to accept is company's failure to note the ruination of Necco anywhere on the package.  I bought a sack of the small size rolls and thought I must have purchased an old, stale lot of Necco rejects.  It was only after I tried Neccos from the regular sized roll that I realized something was horribly wrong.<br /><br />Goodbye old friend.  If I had known the fate your maker had in store for you I would have bought a truck load of you and would, perhaps, be savoring one of your delectable pleasure discs right now.

The "Original" Necco wafers they have come out with bear no resemblance to any product that I have seen in the last 63 years. The colors are washed out, muddy and difficult to tell apart! The only flavor that is distinct is in the ,now gray, Black licorice wafer,the licorice flavor is volatile and flavors the rest of the package. The rest of the flavors are too weak to compete!

review/summary: All natural Necco Wafers
review/text: I didn't think the All Natural Original Wafers were as good as the ones that can be found on sale in most stores selling candy bars.  They advertised 7 flavors--I found lemon, licorice, clove, wintergreen and chocolate. The colors were pale so that most of the time there was no difference in color between the clove and lemon, licorice or chocolate. Mostly I steer clear of "new and improved" but in this case I'll stick with it. I wanted to try them, and I appreciate Amazon.com giving me the opportunity to try them.  As always, their service was outstanding--5 stars.

review/text: I purchased these vanilla beans because they are terribly expensive if you can find them in the stores.  Store #1 had only two in the jar for around $6, while store #2 had ONE in a jar for $8!!  Getting 12 in this pack was a bargain even with shipping!  I have not used the beans yet, but that aroma is mesmerizing...even though the pack is vacuum sealed!  It would have been nice if they had come in a resealable package, but it wasn't a big deal as we have air-tight jars and stored them in one of those.<br /><br />I can't wait to make some creme brulee and homemade vanilla bean ice cream with these!

review/text: I actually bought these for my Mother & Sister-in-law.  They make their own vanilla extract and were worried about affording to get their hands on beans to make some more before the old batch ran out (we live in a somewhat rural area).  I told them Amazon has everything and I'd look there.  They loved the price and the quality and even had some money left over to gift a few beans to a friend of theirs.  I got to enjoy the scent of the beans before I turned them over and was amazed at how long it lasted on my hands!<br /><br />Alton Brown's show had recommended buying beans from Madagascar and explained how to tell if they were fresh.  These beans met all his criteria and were a great buy on top of that!

review/summary: Being Naked Is Good!
review/text: I love granola and cereal in general, but I have to say that this is the very best granola I have ever had. The people at Bear Naked have a philosophy that I love, and which is on the back of every bag: "we believe food should be hand-made from wholesome and natural ingredients you can actually pronounce." Although I do eat processed food, I appreciate the appeal of the more traditionally prepared foods, and this granola tops the list for nutrition and taste.<br /><br />Like most granola, it is high in calories and fat, but take note that the fat comes largely from the nuts contained (it also contains expeller pressed canola oil), and it has no trans fat, and only 1.5g of saturated fat per serving. This cereal is softer than most granola, though not soft enough for me to consider it chewy. It does have large chunks of nuts and also contains cranberries and flax seed, for optimal nutritional and digestive health.<br /><br />The six-pack sold on Amazon makes the price per package reasonable (the ingredients are quite expensive), so as a value proposition, I think this is not only a great product, but a great buy.<br /><br />Delicious and nutritious: a great combination that I recommend highly.

(I'm on a low-fat diet to help combat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. *wince*)<br /><br />I bought myself a 12 oz. packages of the Banana Nut, as well as the Bear Naked Peak Protein Granola. The latter was so-so, but the Banana Nut? YUM!<br /><br />It's delicious plain, in my opinion, but you could certainly eat it with milk/soy milk as cereal, or mix in with some yogurt.<br /><br />There are 11 servings per bag (about 1/4 cup) and here are some nutritional facts per 1/4 Cup:<br /><br />140 calories (60 from fat)<br /><br />Total Fat 7 g (10% DV)<br /><br />NO Trans Fat<br /><br />NO Cholesterol<br /><br />5 mg sodium<br /><br />17 g carbs (3 g dietary fiber, 5 g sugars)<br /><br />3 g protein<br /><br />If you love organic, hand-made, nutritional products, Bear Naked Banana Nut is wonderful! It contains almonds, and tastes a bit like dried banana chips + tasty granola.<br /><br />(P.S. The price here at Amazon is a STEAL! I would have paid over $10 more if I would have bought the same quantities at the grocery store!)

review/text: This stuff is awesome. A great-tasting mix of all-natural granola, WHOLE almonds & walnuts, and banana chips that make breakfast the best meal of my day! I'm not a huge banana fan, but the flavor here is perfect: the bananas don't overpower the nuts and vice-versa. What I like the most is that every mouthful is a little different, depending on the mix of banana, granola, and nuts you happen to get. Great with milk or as a snack. Even though the bag looks small in comparison with the boxes of cereal on the grocer's shelf, you get nearly the same amount of stuff, and the quality is 1000% better than any other granola on the market (just compare the list of ingredients and you'll see what I'm talking about.) Highly recommended, also try the Apple Cinnamon and Fruit & Nut varieties.

review/text: I hesitate to write a review about a food because, well, one man's meat is another man's poison ...  I like the not-too-sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand; the Banana flavour is our favourite.  The Fruit and Nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds (so maybe TOO minimally processed?).  Also, remember that 'All Natural' is NOT organic, even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store.  Our local Target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it.

Better yet, it has 0 (zero, none, nada) sodium!!  A little Bear Naked and some soy milk in the morning and I'm set.  I definitely will recommend this to all my family and friends.

review/text: Quite frankly, this is comparable to the Banana Nut Crunch from Post except this is better.  I look forward to the crunchy banana slices and the almonds that are hidden in this granola.  Great with fat-free milk!  Everyone in my family is in love with this cereal!

review/summary: Best Granola I've Found
review/text: I really like Granola, and have tried many different kinds.  Most of them are just too sweet, more like candy than a nutritious treat with grains and fruit.  These are perfect, I like the Fruit and Nut, it has big whole nuts, so big in fact, I have to pick them out before giving them to my two year old Great Niece that I watch.  My husband prefers the Peak Protien, which has very little fruit because he doesn't like dried fruit.  Those are the only two I have tried but plan on trying them all.

review/text: I was recently give a birthday gift of Bear Naked All-Natural Granola, Banana Nut, 12-Ounce bags (Pack of 6).  I would say that it is probably the best tasting Granola I have ever eaten.  I like to eat Granola with yogurt and this make one of the smoothest Granola breakfast that I have even eaten.

review/summary: Great start if you're trying to eat healthier
review/text: I picked up Bear Naked granola at a chain grocery store (expensive) after pouring over some health and fitness mags....trying to get in the routine of eating healthier.  I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best....and this granola REALLY is.  Less fat, sodium (and all the other stuff you don't want) than other boxed brands I've tried, but tons of flavor you might not expect from a "natural food".  Hats off to the two who started this company.  The banana nut granola DOES taste great!  And I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find it again :)...now I just have to get the rest of my family in line...

review/summary: Bear Naked Granola
review/text: Bear Naked Granola, especially the Fruit & Nut, is a superior product, and we have used the product for some time.  Bear Naked items tend to be expensive in local supermarkets, and the prices are a little better at stores such as Costco.  Costco tends to be out of stock or does not hav the flavor we want.  Purchasing through Amazon was cheaper then the supermarket, cheaper then Costco, and the shipping was prompt and free.

review/summary: A little pricey for granola
review/text: Don't get me wrong, this granola cereal is superior to all others I've tried.  Whole almonds and raisins, cranberries, etc.  But for the price, I was a little disappointed, I expected much more.  The vitamins and minerals are a little on the short side of this product, but mostly beat anything comparable in the grocery aisle.  Like another reviewer, I could also smell a "plastic" odor in the package, but the granola did not have a bad taste nor a bad smell.  The resealable bags are nice, especially to keep the product fresh.

review/summary: Oh, this is for breakfast?
review/text: I found this brand in a local health food store, and more recently in the Targets in my area. It's wonderful stuff. I've yet to eat it as a cereal for breakfast, though. I just pop open the bag and eat it by the handful as a snack. Not too sweet, just enough to taste good. I was recently disappointed in the Vanilla Almond Crunch variety, it tasted too strongly of oil to me. The banana nut has never disappointed. I recommend that you find it locally if you can, to try the flavors, then come to Amazon to buy the ones you like best. The price here is almost $1 off per bag compared to Target.

review/text: Bear Naked is my favorite granola and Fruit and Nut is by far my favorite flavor.  I came across Bear Naked because one of my favorite breakfast's is granola mixed with banana and yogurt.  When I went off of refined sugar I was having the hardest time finding a granola without sugar added.  Bear Naked uses all natural sugars like pear juice and maple syrup.  My favorite part of this flavor is the dried cranberries and the coconut, plus the almonds add crunch to an overall chewy texture.  I recommend this brand to all lovers of granola and to anyone looking for a healthy treat.

review/text: My husband adores this granola! It is dense and chewy, with toasted whole grain flavor. It's not overly sweet, with the raisins adding just enough sweetness to be satisfying. Of course, like all granola, they seem to think that 1/4 cup is one serving...yeah...right; I've watched my husband sit down with the whole bag and a spoon while watching television! I don't eat it that often (calories, doncha know!), because I can't seem to limit myself to 1/4 cup either! This flavor is his favorite (the ones with added protein have an additional flavor that he finds objectionable), which is why we buy it in bulk from Amazon.com.

review/text: I purchased a Bear Naked chocolate / peanut butter granola cereal first part of last year 2009. The Peanut<br />Butter recall came out. I asked the Bear Naked company if this cereal was involved in the recall. They said no<br />it was not. I still did not open the cereal. Then 3 weeks later I actually found it on the recall list. Then they<br />listed it on their site. I inquired again and asked for a refund. Sent several emails and received no response.<br />They do not back their own products. They were apparently using crappy peanuts in there own cereal and did not even know the source of the peanuts. Can't trust them on any of there items. I never got a refund. This company cannot be trusted. Stay away.

review/text: I got one at the venue of my fist half-marathon. The product overall claims to be very nutritious and natural. I admit that it mostly stands true to its claim and, more importantly, whole grain oats are fairly chewable and like that fact that it retains its natural texture too. As other reviewer has pointed out, taste is very well balanced, neither too sweet nor too bland. It comes with nice ziplock bag with all those printed claims that gives impression as if its a sole survivor of past 'age of raw food' and boasts of not having ingredients that any unprocessed food should not have. Neverthless, it keeps granola fresh. May not be able to convince GMO-free community since label has no mention of it (I am sure these guys would put it in billboard fonts if it were ;D).

review/text: This is a very good tasting granola. The almonds in the "banana nut" flavor are very hard, so if this is not a problem go for it and try it out! The cost is high for such a small amount of granola and it doesn't last long even buying it in bulk packages of pack of six in 12 ounce packs. It's all natural which is good, but for the cost I think it would be worth the time to buy the ingredients yourself to save some money.

The walnuts and almonds are big and pack a punch of flavor.  I could care less for the raisins, but I am not a big fan of them in any setting.<br /><br />My favorite preparations are over some plain vanilla yogurt (especially if you add fresh berries), or simply as is for a light snack.  I also like to add some other dried fruit to make it last longer.<br /><br />This is a great item for those with dietary restrictions.  When I fast for Lent or other Orthodox fasts, I always grab a bag as a filling snack.<br /><br />I could not be happier.  This product is simple, good, and versatile.  Highly recommended.
