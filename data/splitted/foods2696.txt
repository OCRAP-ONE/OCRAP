review/summary: The BEST instant Hot Coco Ever!!!
review/text: I am not a big hot chocolate drinker.  A pack came in a gift basket I received so I decided to try it.....WOW!  I looked at a number of Starbucks stores, assuming I could buy more....wrong.  I scoured web sites, including Starbucks....they were sold out.  Only Amazon had them offered and the price was better than any other site.  The seller mailed the product quickly.  The packets are a little "roughed up" looking, but all in tact and the product is tastey.  I tucked a few of the good looking packets under the bows of Christmas presents to share the goodness. Be sure to had a handfull of mini-marshmellows....enjoy.

review/summary: Perfect replacement for morning coffees
review/text: Ever since I got my teeth bleached as a Christmas present 2 years ago, I've been trying to stay away from coffee (which is hard in an office environment considering that's where all the good gossip happens). Well, ever since I found these, my craving for coffee has diminished to none. I make 1 packet of this cocoa every morning with microwaved 2% milk and it satisfies my sugar AND coffee cravings until lunch. Yes, I realize it doesn't actually have any caffeine but the dark, hot, and creamy goodness is close enough! It's the best tasting cocoa you can get in an instant packet and much more chocolate-y than Swiss Miss. Of course, if you're trying to compare this to authentic hot chocolate made with actual chocolate chips, you'd be a bit disappointed.

review/text: GEFEN NOODLE SOUP comes in a styrofoam cup.  Two packets, (one for chicken flavour, one for hard bread chips), come inside the container.  Also included is a "spork"-like plastic spoon, in two pieces which can easily be attached together.<br /><br />To make the soup, all you have to do is pour boiling water into the seemingly solid mass of noodles.  The noodles will soften quickly, and all you need to do then is add as much of the flavour and bread-chip packets as you like.  It is very tasty soup -- with the added bonus, (especially for kosher-eaters), that, although it has chicken "flavour", there is absolutely NO chicken in it, meaning it is, (according to Jewish dietary laws), "parev"...and can be eaten with either meat or dairy.  So, even if you are "kosher observant", you can add milk or cream to this "chicken" soup, with no guilt qualms whatsoever, and taste of the delights of "cream of chicken soup", of which you maty have heard others speak with such delight and relish!<br /><br />This product can also be microwaved.  Directions for either the "kettle" or "microwave" method of preparation are printed right on the label!<br /><br />If there is one thing that I find fault with about this soup, it is the salt content.  The net weight, (dry, I believe), is 2.3 ounces -- though it will be more once you add water and/or milk.  For this 2.3 ounces, it is listed on the label that you get ............................... 1197 mgs of salt (!)  The salt flavour, however, is not overpowering, probably because of the other ingredients within.  I also believe that most of the salt is in the flavour packet, as the ingredients for the flavour packet, (alone), list salt as the first ingredient, but the ingredents for the "noodle" part of the packet list "salt" as only the third ingredient, (but also list "mineral salt" as the fourth.)<br /><br />There is SO much salt in this delicious soup, that, if you drink it hot enough and slowly enough, you can actually unclog your nostrils with it!  A handy thing to be able to do, and a far less messy way to clear out your nostrils than using the "pot" method or other ways.  However, the amount of salt is enormous.....and so I don't recommend drinking this soup more than once a week.<br /><br />As with most foods today, it has its pluses and minuses.  Be aware of the salt content, (be cautions), and the flavour.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Delicious, Gluten-free and the Best Pick-me Up
review/text: Most chocolates are adulterated with thickener and sweeteners. Any health benefits (heart protection via flavonoids, reduced inflammation, anti-depressive) are negated by the additives.<br /><br />The problem is even worse for anyone who is gluten-intolerant because cheap additives and/or poor manufacturing processes may introduce gluten contamination.<br /><br />After scouring local health food stores for all the high-end, hich-cacoa (70-75%) content, organic chocolate bars, I started tasting.  Several caused gluten-reactions.  Others had no taste or "mouth-feel" and were unsatisfying.  A few had nuts that were stale.  (If the manufacturers were careless with the nuts, what else were they being careless with?)<br /><br />As I got down to the last few finalists, I started doing blind tastings.  Terra Nostra was the clear winner.<br /><br />This stuff is GOOD!!  Haven't tried the other Terra Nostra varieties because this one is so perfect at filling that deep primal urge for chocolate.  And it's so satisfying, I rarely go over the 1.5 oz consumption that is now commonly recommended in many health columns for maximum benefits.

review/summary: One Drawback
review/text: The taste is OK, but not great.  The one thing about this that is somewhat annoying is that it's a two serving packet which means that it makes 16 ounces for liquid.  I really only want to eat up 8 ounces at a time.  That means I have to guess how much is half and then roll up the bag to save the remaining portion.  Even if I did want to eat the entire packet, I don't have a bowl that is 16 ounces (and all my bowls are perfectly normal sized).  The bottom line here is that there is nothing wrong with the taste of the soup (still, I'm not in love with it).  I just wish there was a better way of packaging.  I'm the only one eating it, and maybe that affects my opinion.  If you have more than one person in your family then it won't be a problem at all, and you can ignore everything I've said.

review/text: This is a great alternative to chicken soup if you get sick. It will alkalinize you blood and help to get better much faster than you would normally do. Also try it in the morning instead of your regular cup of java - it will perk you up without the jitters of caffeine. True it has a lot of solium, but this sodium is from sea salt that brings with it much needed trace minerals. The seaweed veriety is the best. Open minded and adventurous folks will love it right away, for others it may take some time to get used to. Do try. Your body will thank you.

review/summary: Pretty good, a few drawbacks.
review/text: First of all, the taste is very good. Miso soup is, however, an unusual/acquired taste, but as someone who has been drinking it for years, I find it to be quite yummy. Yes, the sodium content is high, but my diet is pretty low-sodium for the most part, so I am not too concerned. Plus, it only has 30 calories, and is perfect for when you have a craving for something something savory. However, I find the two-serving packets to be rather inconvenient, as it is rather hard to reseal the packets to keep the remaining powder in. Also, I prefer my miso with more seaweed, although that is a personal preference. That is easily remedied by adding some extra dried wakame. Overall, a good quality product.

review/text: First, yes the sodium is high. Taste-wise, I think it is good but more like a beef broth taste and it is much better if you stir it then drink, stir then drink, etc. If you don't stir a lot, you get to the bottom and it is very grainy. Why do I keep drinking it even though the sodium is high? Two words: 30 calories. It's great in the afternoon when you are trying to lose a little excess weight and you want something to taste like food without the calories and you are sick of apples and green tea.

review/text: I have one or two servings of Miso with our without Tofu everyday. If you're a vegetarian, Miso is one way to get some of your B vitamins, as most B vitamins only come from animals. Miso is fermented and the bacteria that thrive in the ferment are full of B vitamins because bacteria are animals. Anyways this version is too grainy, the seaweed is in very small, almost ground up pieces and the flavor is way too salty for my tastes. If you like Miso soup either make your own, or try the Kikkoman products.

review/summary: What's the Fuss About?
review/text: I thought that this was incredibly delicious soup. I was highly concerned, seeing all the negative reviews, that this was a bad purchase and that the product would be downright inedible. My worries were for naught; this soup is amazing! It has a bold, savory flavor that is extremely satisfying, and would make a great lunch or dinner item at an extremely affordable price. It is true, some of the particles don't dissolve, but I don't find them to be unpleasant; all other instant miso soups that I've bought have had the same issue with the particles, and it has never been a bad thing for me. I just kick them up a little when I'm eating the soup; that way, the particles don't become sludge. Perhaps one thing that could make the soup better would be the inclusion of rice or noodles with meat (or tofu, if you're vegan like me), but I find it to be absolutely delightful on its own. Skeptical about buying it? My opinion is, don't be. This is a fantastic product at a great price, and would be a great thing to have around the kitchen for use as a broth or savory flavoring agent if you don't appreciate it on its own. I will buy this product as long as they offer it on Amazon for sure!

review/summary: NOT FIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION !
review/text: Having been raised on miso soup, I was looking forward to trying this instant variety.  Objectively and politely reviewed, it is just terrible!  When stirred briskly into boiling water, the granules become suspended briefly but do NOT dissolve, producing a brown sludge at the bottom of the cup. The presentation is unappetising. The taste is execrable. The bits of seaweed are minusule. And the deadly salt content is ten times (10 X) the recommended allowance!  I am not sure what this is, but I can tell you from 70 years of experience with wonderful miso soups here and in Japan that this product is not fit for human consumption. I threw it out, not wishing to see it restocked and resold by the Seller!

I gave it a chance because I love the soup from the Japanese restaurant I visited and I wanted to taste this soup whenever I wanted, at home. But, I didn't like the flavor, don't know if I'm missing something, but better buy one (ONE) a see for yourself.

review/summary: Don't Buy It -- Dreadful
review/text: I like Seaweed soup and just love the same product from San-J (also available from Amazon -- get it, it's 5-star!).<br /><br />This Miso-cup brand is terrible. I can't tell you more than this is just yicky. Wish there was a zero-star rating.<br /><br />I didn't finish the first cup even (but did give it a second try the next day with same result). Therefore, I only used one 2-serving envelope before giving away the rest. Oh, why did I stray from San-J? Actually, I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cup's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience. But ALL the Miso-cup were equally dreadful!!!<br /><br />I gave these and the other Miso-cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them. Get the San-J brand!!!

review/summary: Bitter!!! I don't remember Miso-cup tasting this awful! Sticking to Kikkoman
review/text: I am a fan of Miso soup. The rest of the household is not. I can buy Miso paste at my local grocery in both red and white, and it tastes wonderful, but to save on fridge space, I often purchase Kikkoman brand miso soup and recall having ordered the traditional version of Miso Cup soup a while ago and it was comparable. While it didn't contain any tofu or wakame seaweed, I have dried wakame in the pantry that I can easily add to an instant powder, and I have tofu as well (though I prefer not to open a whole package of tofu for a single serving of miso soup).<br /><br />The first mistake I made with this soup was to throw it in a single-serving bowl and then realizing each packet was meant to make two servings. So I poured the contents into a larger container and added the two servings of boiling water from my electric kettle. I had to stir vigorously and still ended up with a large chunk of goop at the bottom that I had to mash apart in order to dissolve. It does not dissolve easily, even in a rolling boil. It reminds me a bit of the trouble I have when I want to mix cocoa powder mix for hot chocolate and having it clump up.<br /><br />The first taste of this soup was DISGUSTING. Nothing like what miso soup was supposed to taste like. It was rancid and bitter. I couldn't eat more than two sips - I threw the remaining portions out immediately. Bitter bitter bitter! Disgusted, I read the packaging more carefully -- the Miso cup brand labels this soup as "Savory Soup with Seaweed". In fact, I don't even think this is actual miso soup - the other three versions listed on the package were all clearly labeled as various versions of Miso soup.<br /><br />I made a friend taste it before I tossed it out, and we both agreed that it was bitter "like coffee." I hate coffee. This tasted bitter, and left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth. I have to wonder whether my package was expired or foul - that's how awful it was.<br /><br />I think I was duped by the brand name - "Miso Cup" is the brand, and this is not at all a miso soup. Either that, or I received a very disgusting rancid batch. This is nothing like the "Miso Cup" actual "Traditional Miso" variety that I remembered eating in the past. I am so disgusted I am not going back to this brand at all, I am sticking to the sweeter Kikkoman brand that includes dehydrated wakame and tofu. It's many times more expensive, but it actually tasted like Miso soup. I realize this "Miso Cup" brand is supposed to be more natural, but if I wanted I could easily just buy the miso paste at the grocer and make it myself (mix with boiling water), especially if I'm going to have to add the wakame myself. At least the flavor would be consistent with that faintly sweet miso taste.<br /><br />No more bitter junk for me. I can't see how anyone could consider this appetizing. I can only hope that I received a rancid batch.

Better yet, it is tasty and nutritious whether it is served hot or cold. On cold days, a steaming hot cup of Gano tea comforting and assuring. On hot sunny days, Gano tea served cold quenches the thirst.<br /><br />For those with a sweet tooth, you can serve Gano tea with sugar or Gano honey, which is natural honey blended with ganoderma extract. This combination is so delicious  you can sip the Gano tea all day long!<br /><br />With Gano tea, you won't have to worry about being kept awake. It's low in tannin and is caffeine-free, and in fact, gano extract is known to be good at relaxing your body and ensure a good night's sleep.<br /><br />Further, it has been proven that ganoderma tea does not cause any side-effects, and is good for all members of the family of all ages. It is good for children, and pregnant women too!<br /><br />The Flavorful Super Tea<br /><br />We understand it's natural for you  to wonder if the flavor is affected by the healing herbs.

You'll start to feel a noticeable improvement in your overall well being after a couple of months of daily consumption of Gano tea, but as it is so delicious, we are sure you will enjoy each and every cup!

review/text: Saw this for the first time at the market tonight.  Decided to give it a chance.  I usually use clam juice, fish stock, lobster broth, or anything like that for my seafood dishes.  If I can get a fresh whole fish at a good price, I'll even make the broth myself.  Anyway, opened this up and was very disappointed right from the outset.  It smells like vegetable broth, tastes like vegetable broth, and in the end, what i made tasted like fish in a vegetable broth.  According to the ingredients listed on the package, it actually is vegetable broth, in addition to some seafood ingredients.  Obviously, most of it is vegetable broth.  Nothing wrong with that if that's what you like.  I prefer something that's a lot closer to 100% fish/seafood stock.

Then gently steep for 4 min.  Place onto a large pure white table top.<br />The difference was dramatic.  The Bigelow's green tea looked brown next to the Sencha tea.<br />The taste was just as dramatic.  Bitter initial flavor with a dull harsh after taste vs. A Smooth consistent green tea flavor.<br /> I repeated this 3 weeks later with a different batch of Bigelow's.  Same difference.<br /><br />So if it's GREEN tea your looking for - Bigelow's  is not the one.

The bottom line is it taste great, not too sweet and a good balance of lemon flavor and you can actually taste tea! I have been looking everywhere for it for the past few months. I had some from a Duane Readu in NYC and after i bought out the store they didn't have it again up until a few days ago. If you like ice tea or half and half you should definitely give this a try it's better then most drinks out on the market.

review/text: These peaches are excellent, and extensive surfing and cross-verifying on the internet assures me that Edward & Sons' Native Forest Brand products are packed in BPA free cans.  Also, the USDA is pretty careful about who they allow to use their USDA Organic label, so I trust that a whole lot more than reviewers whose main complaint seems to be that these peaches are produced in China.  One of these reviewers has posted very similar reviews of Native Forest Mandarin Oranges and Native Forest Pears.  He states that the peaches, pears, and mandarine oranges are all either "delicious" or "fairly tasty".  But if he is so fearful about China and what he claims (falsely I believe) that these products are packed in BPA lined cans, I can't help but wonder whether he really tasted any of these products.

review/summary: Delicious Peaches, BPA Free According to Company Rep
review/text: Two important things about these peaches 1) They're delicious 2) according to the email exchange I had with an Edwards and Son's rep (company that makes native forest brand) they ARE BPA free.<br /><br />I think the peaches are delicious, I haven't had any problems with mushiness at all. They come out of the can fresh and delicious and have a relatively long shelf life, although I haven't really tested how good the peaches are after sitting in my cabinet for 3+ months since they're eaten by then. Also haven't had much trouble with dented cans, maybe 1 in 6 will be slightly dented.<br /><br />As far as the BPA issue, the Edwards and Son's rep replied to my email with the list of products that are "specified to be BPA free." The peaches are on the list. The asparagus tips that I used to get from Native Forest were not, I no longer buy them.<br /><br />Hope this clears up the BPA issue (I'll include the relevant part of the email with the list of BPA free products in the comments).

review/summary: Organic, BPA free
review/text: We buy almost anything we can find in BPA free cans.  There is very little available.  These peaches taste ok but sometimes the color is off.  Recently, we got a shipment that had a slight green color.  The cans were dented, so maybe something was off.  Amazon is always good about refunds and replacements, so we're still happy and stick with Amazon because of their policies.

review/summary: Weird flavor.
review/text: I was really excited to find these peaches because they are organic, the can is BPA free, and the ingredient list only includes organic peaches, filtered water, and organic fruit juice concentrate (apple and/or pear).  Perfect!<br /><br />When I actually started eating them, I was really disappointed.  They have a weird flavor, kind of a chemical sweet taste to them.  The best I can guess is that I'm used to peaches in pear juice and the apple juice changes things in a way that I don't like, or maybe the concentrate is not very diluted.<br /><br />I don't know what it is, but I've had about 6-7 peach slices and I'm done.  Maybe they would taste ok IN something, but they don't taste very good on their own.

review/summary: Then: Was Great. Now: Terrible!
review/text: I have been buying these peaches for about three years. They used to be great; nice flavor, healthy appearance. For the last 6-9 months, they've been terrible. The color is pale and the flavor is horrible. Sometimes it tastes metallic, other times they taste bad like maybe they were processed improperly.  I kept buying them in hopes that I got an "off" can.  But alas, I've accepted the fact that all that I buy, whether from Amazon or my local store, are bad.  I have cancelled my subscribe and save and will divorce myself from these forever.

review/summary: Brown Peaches BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK :-(
review/text: The first shipment of these came fine, however I ordered again and although the dates appear to be ok the peaches were BROWN, I'll attach a picture. So I thought maybe just this one but the entire case was like that so I tossed them. Received a third shipment and it was the same way all 12 cans so I chunked them as well and forgot to cancel the subscription so I received (yep, you guessed it) 12 more cans of the same BROWN peaches. Not sure what the issue is here, but I will not be ordering them again. It's a shame really but I learned with this brand it's kind of grab bag. I bought pineapples and they are always perfect, the mandarin oranges I got one of the four shipments(2 cases each time) and the whole case of oranges were hard and inedible and bitter, the fruit salad doesn't even deserve a mention. Sad thing is you dont know until you open the cans :-(

review/summary: A staple in our home
review/text: We buy these peaches regularly through the Subscribe and Save program here at Amazon. They are nice to have on the shelf in times of need.<br /><br />A few "negatives" with this product however. First, the cans regularly arrive dented. We're at the point where we almost expect all the cans to be severely dented and we're surprised when there's one or two in the bunch that are perfectly smooth. Second, the quality from can to can varies. We've opened cans where some (but not all) of the peaches had a green tinge to them. And then there are cans that contain peaches that are a little on the hard and crunchy side.<br /><br />So far, these negatives haven't been a dealbreaker for us so we will continue to purchase them. The peaches are organic and they have a BPA-free lining and that's what keeps us coming back. I took one star off the review simply because of the inconsistency from can to can. It's mildly unsettling to open a can each time and not know what the peaches will be like inside.

review/summary: Metallic Odor and Greenish tint
review/text: I purchased these peaches on May 8, 2012.  All six cans contained peaches with a greenish tint and a metallic odor.  Needless to say these peaches were fit only for the garbage as they were a possible health risk.  The ID number on all the can tops is 2100/01014 C196132Y112A 920110917 BBD2014/09/17. I also purchased a six-pack of the Native Forest Organic Diced Medley Peach and Apricot on the same date.  Two out of six of those cans contained fruit with a metallic odor and taste. Both products (peaches & diced medley) were labeled Product of China. I did request and receive a refund from Amazon.

review/summary: Peaches from China :-(
review/text: I was pretty sad when I got these peaches (which are indeed very delicious) and the can stated they were from China. China, really? "Native Forests" like California and Georgia grow great peaches, why do they need to come from China? It's no secret that organic certification in China is HIGHLY questionable so you can't rely on this product to actually be organic.<br /><br />Also, the other reviewer states the cans are lined with BPA. Double shame, Native Forest!<br /><br />I love canned peaches, but I will not eat another until Native Forest or another company comes out with organic, steam-peeled peaches grown in the USA and canned in BPA-free cans.

review/summary: Love the Chief
review/text: Chief is without a doubt our favorite curry powder and I was pleased to see it offered on Amazon (although it is often out of stock).  The only negative is the price but since I don't have anywhere to get it other than Trinidad, I guess it is reasonable if one considers the airfare for a round trip ticket to Trinidad.<br /><br />This curry is not spicy-hot although you can certainly add some heat to it if you desire.  Curry is a blend of spices, so curries can vary.  Chief curry powder contains Coriander, cumin, garlic, tumeric, fenugreek, ani, and ajwa.  It is a yellowish-green color when it is cooked with chicken or shrimp and onions.<br /><br />Using this curry powder all you need to do to make curried chicken is lightly sear some chicken pieces in oil, add as much onion as you like, make a paste out of the curry powder (about 4 T depending on your taste) using the liquid in the pan, then cover it all with some chicken broth and cook until the meat falls apart. Serve over rice.

review/text: I bought this product for a sugar-free chocolate indulgence.  The nibs are O.K. plain but become a very satisfying on-the-go snack when combined with coconut or goji berries.  Organic Nectars are less bitter than another brand I have tried.  They also have much fewer hard pieces of shell than the other brand.  Some may not like nibs because they are not sweet.  I compare the difference in eating nibs vs. milk chocolate to the difference in drinking a good red wine vs. grape juice.  I do occasionally have Lindt's Excellence 85% cocoa as a delicious alternative.<br />The fact that the nibs are organic is a plus.

review/text: From everything I can tell, these (cacoa) are really good for your body and brain. Much can be said about them. Read David Wolfe's book on this subject if interested.

review/summary: Yummy cocao nibs
review/text: This product is great. The nibs are crispy and crunchy to eat and have good bitter chocolate flavor. Come in a vacuum-sealed pouch to maintain freshness. Much better (and less expensive) than nibs from the bulk bin at your local natural foods store.

review/summary: Cacao Nibs
review/text: I am really sold on the health benefits of raw organic cacao. The nibs are a little too bitter for us to eat by themselves but are really good in homemade trail mixes. Still researching for more ways to work them in our daily diet.

review/text: Cereal. This stuff is fantastic on healthy cereal like Kashi and any cold oat-based product. I sprinkle a heaping spoonful (probably about a tablespoon) on every morning, along with pecans and blueberries (if they're in season). It adds a fruity and complex chocolate taste that doesn't overpower the fruit, nuts, and oats. Oh, and probably about 5 grams of fiber. On that note, maybe I should recommend that you work your way up to my super-cereal. 15 grams of fiber in one sitting might not be a good idea if that's how much you usually get in a day.

review/summary: good food recieved on time!
review/text: i'm a vegan and always missed ramen from my non vegan days over a decade ago. These are vegan and a great subsitute for regular ramen. I think they are healthier although they probably contain as much sodium but the flavors are fantastic. I mixed in fresh mushrooms while the ramen was cooking and it made it even more delicious! a great buy, and it arrived on time, great packaging too! (the ramen packages were 99% whole!)
