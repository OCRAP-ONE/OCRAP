review/summary: not quite what i was expecting!
review/text: My family loves olives and we generally go through a bag this size in a couple weeks.  These took us much longer to finish since the taste was not to our liking and the olives had lots of broken pits in them.  I will not be buying these olives again.

review/summary: It's the Pits
review/text: Cracked olives should not result in small bits of olive pits.  Most of these olives have bits of broken bits from the cracking process.  The spice and oil mix is ok but not pleasant.  A bit on the mushy side as well.  I was disappointed.

review/summary: LOVE these chews!
review/text: It is awesome to find a dental chew that is safe for a teething puppy AND nutritious.  I also love that it has cranberries in it to help my little girl's urinary health; and DHA to help her developing brain.  My 4 month old Lhasa Apso puppy, Alexi, goes crazy for these! She polishes a small one off in about 15 minutes.  I've considered getting the large ones to keep her chewing longer, but I worry that they might be a bit too big.  These are a fantastic value and are much cheaper than similar brands.  I tried the CET dental chews, and they made her terribly sick (and I won't consider Greenies at any age due to the ingredients).  Alexi eats a corn-free, gluten-free, wheat-free, soy-free diet, and these fit the bill perfectly.  She eats Canidae Lamb and Rice as her food and gets these and Zuke's for treats and chews.  I'm happy to have a puppy in great health, and I am relieved to find something that she loves to chew on while her mouth hurts from teething.  Also, these don't leave a mess on my carpet, and they sit perfectly on her little tummy.  Really, I am addicted to this product.  Also, the price is great for 18 of them!  I got the antioxidant ones for my Mom to give to her older dogs.

review/text: I have a sensitive nose and can't stand the smell of puppy breath, but these really help a lot. They smell very faintly of peppermint with a slight sweet twist to it.<br /><br />My 2lb yorkie loves these things! I cut them in half for him to chew on since 1 a day is for 5-10lbs.. but they last him forever! He can chew on half for probably 30 minutes and still have at least half of what I gave him still there.<br /><br />Only problem I have with it is that little specs of it come off and rub onto the carpet or whatever he is eating it on, so be careful!!

review/text: I have a beagle puppy that like to chew everything and cries when he doesn't get attention. These treats help with both problems, it keeps him busy so he is not whining and not chewing on anything but his sticks. I love that it is natural as I do not give him any foods or treats with any byproducts. I cannot say that he prefer these treats to others. He eats anything and everything I give him.

My dog isn't picky so he'll eat anything, but if he loves something, he will cry and beg for more and will also finish it in a flash. With these, he only ate it half way and didn't touch it again until the next day.

review/text: I bought these for my 10 week old puppy to keep him busy for a little while during dinner or in the morning when I get ready.  I was previously using the N-Bone Puppy Teething rings but these are smaller and less expensive. My puppy can chew through one of the small ones in about 15 minutes but it is made to be eaten.  It keeps him busy for a few minutes, which is nice.  I would reccomend these to keep their attention for a short time.  A lot of other reviews mentioned that there was a strong smell, so I specifically checked this, they do have an odor but I had to hold it to my nose to smell it.  Overall it is a good product.

review/summary: Keeps a Lab Puppy Busy!
review/text: I have a 12 week lab/border collie mix who is in the beginning stages of teething. (Teeth aren't coming out, but the new ones are working around in her gums, giving her pain.) This is the first item I've found that keeps her focused and happy for 15 minutes at a time. Anyone who has owned a lab puppy knows this is a LONG time for focus on a single item that isn't furniture. She chews for about 15 minutes, then walks away. I give it back to her later and she goes at it for another 15. I'd say it lasts for about four sessions of this. I don't give her a whole stick in one day, since she's still small- but it has been a great way to refocus her teething for short periods of time.

If i ever need him to do something I just pull out one of these bad boys and Voila he is at attention... They're just so expensive 6 for 8 dollars is a bit much and they dont come in larger quantities... My puppy easily eats one of these in 30 minutes so i wish they were less expensive and had bags with larger quantities... One a day is a great way to keep your puppy's bums, teeth and breath clean...

This makes these the ideal teething chew-able treat.

I have a 3 month old pitbull who is teething pretty bad lately, so i figured these would be a good way to help her teeth as well as be a good treat for when she does something good. I broke the treats up into four smaller pieces, and she had about one total stick a day. The third day in she started having very runny BM. They may just be too strong for her tummy, but they definetly didnt work for her. I was pleased with the shipping, and didnt need to contact the seller so i dont have any reviews on that.

I do supervise her the entire time she chews on any chew treats and sometimes divert her attention while I take back the treat when she chews the treats down into pieces so small she may choke.  I would buy these chew treats again and I would recommend them to my friends who have pups or dogs.

She has chewed them a bit, but prefers the ribs from the deer we shot over these sticks.  :-)).  We hope she will eat them eventually, but if not we will give them to another dog.  She is getting her teeth now so it may  happen.  Will update this review if she goes to town on them.  We feed her only all natural foods, so she is used to the natural flavors over the nasty stuff found in majority of pet foods.

review/summary: Dog loves them
review/text: My dogs loves these, and they were helpful with getting him adjusted to his crate at night (I would just drop one in after locking him in). I can't say that they really help to keep his teeth clean, although my husband says that he can smell the mint on the dog's breath after the dog has eaten one.

review/summary: Great for Puppies!
review/text: These are great for my 4 month old Bichon.  It is really difficult finding appropriate treats for puppies under 6 months.  Usually the puppy edible bones or rawhide are for dogs 6 months and older.  I want to keep my little puppy busy during meal times or times when he needs a distraction.  These are great for that (about 10-15 minutes) and are healthy for him!  The Nylabone Healthy Edibles for puppies are great as well (for puppies 3 months and older), but only last about 7 minutes on average.  These Dental Chews last about twice as long.

review/summary: MY PUPPY LOVES THESE
review/text: my 4 1/2 month old min pin shakes when she sees the pink bag.  She jumps extra high for these and they provide 20 minutes of chewing.  They are very healthy too.  Cranberry for bladder, chia seeds for brain, carrots for eyes and her breath is fresh.  They are not cheap but Ive bought 3 bags and they are all natural.<br />I love my baby, so it's worth it.

review/summary: Great for leaving the house!
review/text: I have a baby pomeranian and he is the biggest cry baby when he has to be put in his crate! I don't tolerate it so I'm training him to be in his crate for longer periods of time and these help. It takes awhile for him to be quiet when I open the container, but I give him one when I leave for a couple of hours and when I come back he is happy as a clam and much more quiet! I think it takes him about a half hour to eat one, but I think he's getting faster. I saw someone wondering if they should get the large to last longer and I'm thinking the same thing. They are really stinky, so I recommend putting them in an air tight container that's easy to get in and out of. My only complaint is that they are a bit expensive! I wish they came in one of those Amazon Bulk deals.

review/text: My dog goes crazy when she sees me getting these out! They are healthy treats , and clean her teeth too. They are 18 in a pack for the small treats , so they go a long way. I research extensivley before I give my girl anything , I give her only healthy food and treats. I feel good about giving her these. They aren't a hard treat , say like pig ears. They are softer and they digest good. They don't break off in little pieces that can splinter. They are more of a hard but chewy treat. I highly reccomend them!

review/summary: My dog loves it!  But it's expensive...
review/text: I have a 7 month old chiweenie puppy who goes crazy for these treats.  I like the fact that it has quality ingredients so I feel good about giving the treats.  I give him 1/2 a stick at a time because my dog is so tiny (5-6 lbs) and I don't want him filling up on these only, and it takes him about 3-4 min to eat it, so its not much of a "chew-toy" that keeps him occupied. It IS hard to cut...but I've learned to break it in half without knives. And it IS expensive...8 dollars for 18 sticks??  The price is my reason for not giving 5 stars.

They are healthy and didn't give him any stomach problem, and kept him quiet for about 20 minutes (which is amazing for him!)

review/summary: Gave it 2 stars for the ingredients only...
review/text: I bought this product for my Yorkie and was so disappointed.  First of all, they completely stink.  Second, the sticks are so hard that you have to cut them for a smaller breed with a good quality steak knife (I used my high end stainless Henkles knives and it took some effort).  My puppy (7 1/2 months) has torn through extra durable Nyla bones and is a VERY TOUGH chewer, so I was looking for something he can "play with" and eat which wasn't synthetic.  He didn't know what to do with it even though he seemed to like it as a toy for a minute or two.  But, the smell was overwhelming to me.  I will donate them to a local rescue.  Interestingly enough, I also bought him other Get Naked treats and he didn't care for them either.  Perhaps he just doesn't like this brand.  He does love Blue Buffalo treats, Welness Puppy treats (they also stink, but in a bearable/pate kind of way!) and SoJo's too!

review/text: The 12" size takes my 5 month lab up to a week to work through. She did just get all of her permanent teeth in, so maybe that time will speed up given some months. Yes, they do have a bit of a smell, but it's more like I get an occasional whiff when she's chewing on it.  If the chew is just lying around, I don't smell anything.  They haven't left any stains on my carpets, and she hasn't lost interest in them.

review/summary: Thin as a pencil, smelly
review/text: I am a frequent user of bully sticks from other vendors online and from pet stores. These are listed as "THICK" bully sticks. I usually buy thick ones from another vendor and my German Shepherd pup loves them and they last a couple of days. These arrived and I was immediately disappointed. Many of them are the thickness of a pencil or slightly thicker. They are about 1/3 the thickness of the "thick" bully sticks I usually buy. But I did not want to deal with sending them back so I gave one to my pup. It smelled HORRIBLE, like a person who had not washed in weeks. My pup liked them okay but because they are so thin she can eat an entire, 12" one in under an hour. Will NOT buy these again.

review/text: Having a puppy means having enough things for him to chew on. I love these bully sticks because they last a really long time and can keep him busy chewing for what seems like forever. Because they last so long they are economical as you don't have to buy them week after week. Bottom line is he loves them and I lvoe that he loves them.

Love that they are grass fed and hormone/antibiotic free. This is EXTREMELY important to me!!! The length was near perfect on every one. The smell was minimal. My dog loved them and I recently purchased more. The price is out of this world!!!! I was paying over $7.00 for one, locally. Great product, great price, great value!

review/summary: Excellent Quality Bully Sticks
review/text: I purchased the 12" bully sticks (7 pack) from Downtown Pet Supply about a week ago.  One of my two dogs recently passed away, and the other was feeling a little depressed.  I wanted to give her a "special treat", but also hoped that these would help perk up her poor appetite since her sister's passing.  Boy have these done the trick!  I let her chew on the stick for about 30 minutes & then took it away.  Low and behold, she remembered she was hungry and ate all of her food!  She is a 50lb Lab mix who is very healthy at 13.5 years old.  In the past I had purchased 6" bully sticks at a local pet supply store for $5 each.  These sticks come out to be just under $3.50/stick and are twice the size!  This purchase was well worth it -- quality product for a great price.  I will re-order again.  Thank you!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I was hesitant to purchase this product after reading other reviews about them not being "thick".  But, since I couldn't find any other thick bully sticks on here, I thought I'd give them a shot.  Well, I am very disappointed!  They are not thick at all.  They are the same, "slim jim" thickness as every other bully stick I've bought before.  I'm not even sure why they advertise them as thick.  The thickest one is MAYBE as big around as a dime.  Not at all what I expected, and I won't order them again. I kept them just because they are at least cheaper than the same size ones I can get at the store - and it's a pain to have to return them.  My 10 month old beagle consumed one in less than an hour, start to finish.  I was hoping to find something that would last longer than that!

review/text: I like this coffee, but compared to the 3 or 4 other blends I have tried from Raven's Brew, this is my least favorite. I was looking for a smoother blend to add a little variety, but this almost boarders on bland. There are hints of a great flavor there, but no matter the grind, amount used or method of making a cup it never tastes better than okay. There is a bit of floral flavor as advertised, but it is not pronounced enough to make this a unique experience.

review/summary: Floral and Wine
review/text: I rate this coffee at a 5 not because I really really loved it, but because it is exactly what it describes. I have only ever had very dark roast beans with chocolatey and earthy undertones. I honestly had never tried a coffee that has been described as "floral" or "winey." However, I can honestly say that my first impression of this coffee was "hmm.." I have had only one other Raven's Brew coffee and that is Wicked Wolf blend, which I found delightfully earthy and full bodied. This cup tastes exactly how it is described, like a fruit and wine symphony which works very well with this roast. I can imagine that if it was a dark roast, the mellow wine flavor would become bitterness. Which brings me to the next point, this coffee is not pure unleaded petroleum in a cup. It is a lighter roast and results in a more delicate flavor.<br />It's not my favorite cup ever, but that is today. I can imagine it being an excellent summer coffee and even a good iced coffee. I was not sure what to expect from this cup, but know that when Raven's Brew describes it's coffee, it is very accurate.

review/summary: Don't use the latte glass for this without making this adjustment...
review/text: I tried this at a demo and it was awesome but when I made it myself it was watered down tasting. I called Dolce Gusto to complain and it turns out that the glass they show on the side of the box to make it in isn't the latte glass it looks like. That's a 7 oz. glass, and the latte glass that ships with the machine is 8 oz. The other glass isn't available as yet. That's why it tasted watered down. If you use the latte glass just add about a 1/2" or so less of each capsule and it should be fine.<br /><br />The Dolce Gusto folks should have mentioned this on the box as I'm sure many have made the same error not knowing it's a different glass. It does look like the latte glass but if you look closer it's not as tall. Since it's an easy error to make I wanted to mention it here.

review/summary: Terrible - but don't let that stop you from buy the Dolce Gusto
review/text: I'm not sure why all the glowing reviews for this mocha.  I've tried everything to make it palatable, and was on the verge of returning the whole Dolce Gusto machine as this was the first coffee we made.  First we followed the recommendations for brewing to the letter, than tried variations.  LOTS of variations.  Nothing makes this taste like a good mocha.  It always just tastes like bad hot chocolate with some weak coffee thrown in.  A couple days later, after seriously considering sending everything back, I tried the Cappuccino.  It is AMAZING!  So, moral of the story - don't return your machine until you try another flavor for the Dolce Gusto.  The only reason this gets two stars is that they actually produce a mocha; so far none of the other 1-cup machines do.

review/summary: Great cup of chocolate coffee
review/text: Tried the machine at a kitchen shop that was demonstrating it.  My husband and I were so impressed by the cappucino the Dolce Gusto machine made that we bought it on the spot.  At home, we decided to try the mocha flavored coffee and I thought I was in heaven.  My husband said it was the best cup of coffee he had ever had... and I agreed!

review/summary: Better than coffee shop!
review/text: If you own a Dolce Gusto coffee machine, you can't beat the Mocha capsules for delicious flavor.  The machine itself is fabulous, and there are many capsules from which to select.  But being a chocoholic, I favor the mocha and find it superior to that found in most professional coffee shops.

review/text: My favourite coffee is strong bitter espresso. Sometimes I like to try capuccino, late etc.. I like this  product - It is not strong, have a nice aroma and for a coffee in capsules (it is impossible to get fresh and good coffee in capsules) is very good. I would like again to say how impressed I am with purchasing from Amazon - very fast delivery, well packed.

review/text: I recently purchased the Dolce Gusto machine, and Mocha was the last flavor that I tried.<br /><br />It is definitely my favorite. I made it with a little more of the coffee/chocolate capsule than the milk one, and it was delicious.<br /><br />A must have for any mocha lover!

review/summary: Sinfully delicious product for the Dolce Gusto
review/text: I ordered the Dolce Gusto mocha for my family to drink on Christmas morning.<br /><br />However, I immediately opened it when the package arrived, and I devoured every drop. My mother has a Dolce Gusto machine as well, and she loved it, too. In fact, she even had a rare second cup before I left.<br /><br />Christmas is coming in a few days, and I am already excited about sitting down with my family to taste Mocha on Christmas morning. This is an excellent product that is the perfect new product for the Dolce Gusto, which is one of the best kitchen appliances of this decade.

review/summary: No coffee grounds, it's instant coffee
review/text: When my husband and I tried the Dolce Gusto mocha for the first time, we were surprised that it tasted more like hot chocolate than coffee.  Further inspection of the box (and confirmed by opening a used capsule) revealed that unlike the other DG flavors (with or without milk) which have real coffee grounds, the mocha coffee capsule contains soluble instant coffee instead.<br /><br />It's not bad if you like a caffeinated hot chocolate, but by the name "mocha" I was expecting a proper latte with a little cocoa added, so I was rather dissapointed.  Wish the description had mentioned about the instant coffee - neither Amazon (at the time of my order and this review) nor the DG website says that.  I love my DG machine and crave a cappuccino more than once a day, but this mocha is not a flavor that I would come back to regularly.  On occassion though (since I have 3 boxes of this stuff!) I'd use this to make more of a cafe Viennois by adding whipped cream to it...

review/summary: Nescaf&eacute; Dolce Gusto Brewers, Mocha
review/text: I used to have a tassimo coffe brewer but when they stopped making starbucks I decided to switch. I decided to switch to the nestle machine based upon its glowing reviews. I loved the mocha drinks on the tassimo machine and I did not want to go back to plain coffee so I was pleased to see the nestle machine offered a pretty good flavor selection. The mocha flavor has a rich chocolatey, coffee flavor and the milk capsule forms a nice foam. I will admit the starbucks mocha capsules were better on the tassimo machine but this is still pretty great for a home machine!

review/summary: Artificial Milk Taste
review/text: Being a long time mocha drinker (Starbucks and a local coffee shop near my home), I was looking for a cheaper alternative to $4.55 per Grande and for something I could make at the office.  I thought the Dolce Gusto system would fit the bill.  Maybe first, a bit about the coffee I like.  For regular coffee, Starbucks is okay but weak.  I definitely prefer Starbucks Espresso ground (bought from store) made with my Aeropress  (one and 1/2 scoops coffee to make 1 coffee mug worth of coffee (4 oz)).  I don't like Peete's coffee (too bitter) and although I have tried Barefoot coffee, I don't care for that either.  Back to the Dolce Gusto.  The biggest problem with the Dolce Gusto Mocha is the milk pods.  The milk tastes incredibly artificial.  The coffee is also very weak.  I ended up getting milk (stored in a refrigerator at work), mixing it with Ghiradelli Chocolate Mocha Hot Chocolate and using the Cafe Americano (but pulling only 3.7 oz).  It's acceptable but hardly a replacement.  Thus far, I have also tried the Caramel Latte Dolce Gusto and the artificial milk taste is there also.  I would imagine that the person who likes this Mocha also likes International Delights type of coffee.  It's definitely not for me.  I will try the Dark Roast with my mocha mix next and hopefully get a decent mug of mocha.

review/summary: Best coffee I've ever tasted
review/text: Makes Starbucks & Dunkin Donuts seem like junk & is lots less expensive. Of course you must have one of the Nescafe Dolce Gusto machines but they are worth every penny. Not only are they incredibly easy to use, they will pay for themselves by saving you the time & expense of having to go out & buy each individual cup of coffee that isn't as good despite being more expensive. I also get the cappuccino which is also the best I've ever had.

review/text: I purchased the nescafe dolce gusto creativa coffee maker and it was by far the best purchase ever, after trying the variety of flavors they have I was blown away by the quality and rich flavor of the coffee. I've been a fan of the mocha lattes for as long as I can remember and this one is really good. It's even better than the one sold at the coffee shop and a lot cheaper. My husband was skeptic about the coffee maker and the coffee because he previously tried the keurig; but after making his first cup of french vanilla latte macciato he loved it. On the other hand I tried the dolce gusto coffee first and then I tried the keurig; I must say that the keurig sucks compared to this one. I would definitely recommend this to anybody! I can't wait for nescafe to me up with even ore variety of coffee:D

review/text: I only drink coffee as a speciality and now I drink 2 cups a day.  This product is great.  The flavor is smooth and decadent.  I have to admit I add an extra squirt of chocolate because I like my coffee sweeter.  To note, I know coffee has caffeine but I don't get a buzz from this coffee, I'm not sure why.  It does keep my caffeine headaches away though.  The best part about this drink is the creme.  It is like drinking a melted truffle on the top of your coffee - yummy!

review/summary: SALT SENSITIVE?  CONSIDER THIS.
review/text: When my wife was recently diagnosed as hypertensive, finding ways to avoid or at least minimize the use of prescription medications became a high priority.  When it was also determined that she was salt sensitive, use of the DASH diet seemed like a natural step to take.  We began to methocially read food labels and were shocked to find how many simple things:  condiments, breads, everyday staples were really loaded with lots of sodium.  So we set out to eliminate as much salt from our diet as possible while not having to sacrifice our pleasure in good dining.  Mrs. Dash salt-free products became one of our first and most delicious finds.  Substituting Mrs. Dash Marinades for our old standbys was incredibly easy and the feared cravings for the sacrificed salt proved to be illusory.  With our dining exprience preserved and blood pressure readings beginning to approach normal, we knew that Mrs. Dash was a winner in both satisfactory taste and health.
