review/summary: Good dog food, good price
review/text: I got this for a large American Bulldog.  He likes it and it is good quality at a fair price.  It does have corn in it but at least corn is not the first ingredient.  This is good basic dog food, nothing fancy but it's a bargain and it actually smells like it is edible.  The cheaper dog foods smell vile and toxic, this smells like actual food and the dog likes it and is doing well on it.

review/summary: Right amount of protien, quality product, affordable price
review/text: Our breeder introduced us to Diamond Adult Maintennance Chicken dog food.  She explained to us that we needed to make sure the protien levels in dog food are not too high as it could result in too fast a growth spurt in our 10 month old Rhodesian Ridgeback.  Also swollen knuckles may occur if too much protien is present.<br /><br />We have been very happy with this product and thankfully Amazon has it with Super saver shipping otherwise we would have to switch since no one in Hawaii is selling Diamond.

review/summary: Been using for years, healthy, shiny coat
review/text: This is by far an "undiscovered" kibble for many that are buying over-priced kibble.  Was raised on a ranch & my parents bought this @ the feed store many years ago.  Kept using it for my dogs (typically Dobies) and as always they live a longer, healhty life with lots of energy, shiny coats and enjoy the food.  I have actually tried other, higher priced brands & some dogs got the "runs", others threw up, etc.  So back to a tried and true brand they love.  Love the subscribe & save aspect as well.

review/summary: Please offer this year-round through Subscribe & Save!
review/text: This tea is delicious either hot or cold. Its aroma is so rich and soothing that it would be worth brewing even if you didn't drink it.<br /><br />So many of us want this year-round that I wish Amazon would make it available through Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />If only Celestial Seasonings would ALSO make a decaff version of this tea, I could enjoy it in the evening as well. (I'm super-sensitive to caffeine). But at least this "regular" version is a great start to my day.<br /><br />Since I sometimes have trouble finding Nutcracker Sweet at a reasonable price, I occasionally "stretch" it by brewing it thus: 1 bag of Nutcracker Sweet + 1 bag of PG Tips + 3 cups of boiling water. The two teas complement each other very nicely.<br /><br />When it's iced, sweetened with Xylitol (which dissolves best while the tea is still warm), and laced with a bit of milk or Half & Half, it satisfies me more than most desserts. I even know some people who add a drop of Irish Cream....

review/summary: Delicious for the toffee or butterscotch lover
review/text: I bought this for my husband who is a huge toffee/butterscotch fan, but so far I have used most of them myself. The coffee itself is delicious - a rich, medium roast, but the added flavoring makes it a nice treat. You can taste subtle notes of chocolate; however, the primary flavor is a similar to butterscotch. Not necessarily a first thing in the morning kind of coffee, but definitely great as a late morning or afternoon treat.

review/text: The flavor of this coffee is rich and creamy. It really does taste like someone melted a piece of toffee in my cup. It naturally very sweet like something they would put whip cream on at Starbucks. I use this as an everyday coffee because I have a large sweet tooth and sometimes a dessert coffee. It also fills my house with the smell of toffee. It is a great way to wake up in the morning.

review/summary: Try it with a little milk...
review/text: Coffee preferences are very personal.  Before Keurig, I recall a lot of debate in a small office, at the salon, etc.  I decided to try the Butter Toffee because of all the great reviews and because I like Butter Toffee-flavored candies.  It smells great but, it tastes a little bitter to me.  My cleaning lady, on the other hand, LOVES it.  She suggested I try it with a little milk or coffee creamer the way she takes it.  I usually drink mine black but, I decided to try it HER way.  A little milk does mellow the taste, making it more like the butter toffee it purports to be.

What's up with that Amazon?!<br /><br />The first two cans of this soup I've used so far were both more than a little dented, and the second one could really be considered dangerously so since it was very difficult to find a way to get it open (almost gave up on it).<br /><br />Get with it Amazon!  You've got some good products to offer, but it seems a shame that people really might decide it's not worth it to re-order if you keep sending the overabundance of sometimes even dangerously defective dented cans!

review/summary: Yes, I too drink whatever is left from the bowl after salad- YUM!!!!!
review/text: I honestly don't think there is another dressing out there as healthy AND tasty as this one - I have been buying it for several years now and can truly say that I am addicted to the amazing taste. SOOOO good!!! No sacrificing taste for healthy ingredients here! I cracked up at the other reviewers' comments about drinking whatever was left after finishing off the salad since I thought I was the only one. And how can you go wrong with these ingredients: Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, Bragg Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, purified water, organic honey, organic garlic, Bragg Liquid Aminos, organic onion, organic black pepper, natural xanthan gum. The only item on the list I am not crazy about it Xanthan Gum due to its frequent association with corn, a universally mold-contaminated crop, and some controversial reports (not all Xanthan Gum is made from corn, but as a fermented additive I would not be excited if I learned that Bragg's uses the corn version). Fortunately it is the last (meaning least amount used) ingredient on the list. But overall, I LOVE this product and even with the one possble weak link, still think it it WAAAY better than anything else out there (other than making your own, which I used to do before I fell in love with this ;-).

review/summary: Great product but over-priced here
review/text: Today I purchased this product at my local health food store (which, BTW, is not any bargain hunter's dream).  When I tried the dressing, I enjoyed the taste, as well as its nutritive qualities.  Consequently, I came to Amazon hoping to not only find it, but at a more competitive price.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen.  My local store's normal price is $4.99.  Howver, a (regular monthly) 10% off everything sale was happening today. Factor in local sales tax of 5%.  Considering all of that, my final price was still under five dollars.  Compare this to the current Amazon price of $8.99.  Of course I'm disappointed.<br /><br />Earlier comments about a high shipping price for this item seem to no longer apply, because the product is now shipped free with any $25 order--a policy I always look for!  If Amazon could arrange a more competitive price for this item (perhaps by selling it in six-packs???), then I'd consider purchasing this excellent dressing from Amazon.  Please reconfigure your pricing here, Amazon!<br /><br />UPDATE 10.26.10<br />Amazon, since I last wrote, you've reduced the per/bottle price to $5.49.  I'm glad to see you're apparently responsive to feedback!<br />This new price is no steal, but at least it's somewhat comparable to other retailers.  (Yet, I look to Amazon for super bargains, and not so much for "regular" prices.)<br />For example, above I referenced a local health food store whose every day price for this product is $4.99/bottle.  For the month of October, however, that same store has this product on sale for $3.99/bottle.  I figure there's sufficient profit margin to permit a month-long temporary mark down like that.<br />Hence, I repeat: Amazon, consider selling this awesome dressing in 4-packs or 6-packs (or any combination which drops the per/bottle price below $5.49).  In view of your staggering sales volumn, it seems kinda likely that you could arrange a price that beats the every day price of my local health store.<br /><br />To anyone who hasn't tried this yet, sample it!  It's a good risk because you'll likely find it to be very flavorful.  It's healthful, also.  I enjoy it so much that I tend to pour it on all kinds of foods now, in addition to salad.  (If you try it, you'll see what I mean.)

review/summary: Strange...
review/text: Let me just say that this tea is about average. I feel like the tea wasn't made to high standards, but then you have the fact that they're whole leaves. I think this creates a weird situation where you have a bad product of high quality. I'm a supertaster, so I will describe the product as best as I can. It has your typical oolong bass notes, but the higher notes are very grassy (sometimes oolong is sweet, bitter...etc etc etc, this is grassy). It has a fair balance between bitterness and boldness. Incase you aren't gathering what I'm trying to say... it's a very neutral flavor and doesn't really 'wow' me at all. The grassy flavor taste exactly like wheaties cereal (no frosted).... and that sounds stupid but when you try it you'll instantly make the connection.<br /><br />So, in conclusion it's a plain tea that I won't really hold up high on my tea shrines, but it does have one last unique quality. It taste odd, but I can't stop drinking it. It's like raman noodles... you never say "man I can sure go for some raman", but when you are actually eating raman you make sure you eat every last noodle. It's like that.<br /><br />12/10/11 EDIT: After drinking a few of these, I can say that it's a great tea to drink without anything added. I normally add sugar to most of my teas in some way or another (honey, sugar, guava), but I find that this tea is actually really good without anything added. I'm not going to officially change my 3 star rating, but I am tempted to bump it up to 4 stars.

review/summary: Deliciously flavorful pretzel
review/text: From the moment I tasted these delicious, fat-free pretzels, the excellent butter flavor spoiled me for all other pretzels. The snaps are bite size, and only 5 calories per pretzel. I like them with or without dips, and I often eat them instead of crackers with soup. They also have plenty of snap when you are craving a crunchy snack.<br /><br />Warning: The butter flavor snaps are a bit pricey compared to regular snap pretzels. You pay a premium for the extra seasoning.

review/summary: Spa in a Jar
review/text: When you first open a jar, you think you are in a spa with the herb mix and it smells so good! It also tastes wonderful! I use it on everything from meats to risotto to salads. I suggest that after you use a little bit, to shake it before you use it so that the mix stays mixed as after a while the lighter herbs and pepper can sink to the bottom and the end of the bottle can be a bit heavy on only certain things but to do a little shake simply restores the mix. I have gone through many bottles since my cousin turned me on to this and given many for gifts! It is really wonderful and my go-to jar so it sits on the counter with at least one in reserve (sometimes several as I give them away).

review/summary: A Quick but Disappointing Fix for the Sweet-Tooth
review/text: After seeing these quick, single-portion snacks in the market I decided to order a large package to keep them in the pantry to satisfy those sweet-treat cravings.  The product is disappointing in both it's size and quality.  A slightly more generous portion would help to satisfy the late night snack urge; the quality is okay.  I ultimately decided not to keep these in stock in the pantry - they don't quite hit the mark.

review/text: We love Warm Delights. They are individual desserts but we usually split one between us. It makes just enough to eat and since none is left over, no over indulging. Even if you do eat a whole one, it's better than being able to help yourself to seconds. They are easy and quick to make and taste great. Yes they cost more than buying a cake mix and making a whole cake but they take less time, no added ingredients other than water, and again, no left overs. I have been buying them since they came on the market and will continue as long as they make them. The variety lets you have a different dessert each day too.

review/summary: Skeptical at first, but won me over completely!
review/text: I received this dessert as part of a free box of groceries sent to me by Amazon to introduce their new grocery store. I had not tried this product before, and wouldn't have picked it up in the store. A quickie microwave dessert didn't sound that appetizing at first.<br /><br />Was I ever surprised! This dessert is indeed a warm delight, and tastes as luscious as any fudgy chocolate chip cookie dessert with drizzled topping that I've ever gotten in a restaurant. It was instant gratification, too, rather than the cumbersome mix-and-bake time of a conventional Betty Crocker mix. Stir it up, nuke it for a few seconds, and eat!<br /><br />I tried this on a day when I was sick and wanted a treat, but was definitely NOT up to cooking. This is definitely a quick, convenient, tasty treat. I plan to buy more for lunches - a quick, freshly baked dessert at work is a wonderful concept. A young person could also mix it up quickly without having to bother mom, since it's complete with bowl.<br /><br />Very economical, easy, tasty way to prepare a quick dessert. Can't wait to try the other flavors.

review/summary: Best ghee in the world
review/text: Ghee is more than an indulgence. Ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement (albeit, one that tastes really good). Ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion, but it can be a healthy addition to any diet.<br /><br />Some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol.<br /><br />I performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available. I compared quality and value. Ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed -- especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used.<br /><br />The ghee comparison table can be found at this blog:<br />[...]<br /><br />When I started this ghee comparison, I was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products. However, I learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards. It was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available. It is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on Amazon.com. (Ancient Organics Ghee is my #1 pick.)<br /><br />Because such high quality ghees are available, I focused on understanding which product is the most authentic. Some of the ghees are much more authentic than others. The information in the table (link above) reflects that fact.<br /><br />The focus of my evaluation is not gourmet cooking. It is optimum health. Therefore, I am concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest.<br /><br />I rank Ancient Organics as the very best ghee. It is #1. It is the healthiest product as well as the best tasting. The ghee is so good it is almost magical.

review/summary: One-of-a-kind ghee---It's SO delicious and nourishing!
review/text: For over 10 years, I have made my own ghee, tried various brands and nothing compares to this uniquely produced and amazingly flavored ghee.  Because they are a smaller creamery, they do charge more and it is so well worth the price.  We did some research and found out that ghee has a huge health benefit of unclogging vessels in the body rather than clogging them like butter can (and other articles and reports such as [...], said it is casein free and yet others said it is lactose free too)...so, that's the logical side for using it-but with this ghee, the TASTE is so incredibly DELICIOUS, that our family can't even consider butter or margarine now.  Ghee stays soft and does not have to be refrigerated. The shipping is reasonable through Amazon, especially so you can try it in the smaller size.  The main point is that it seems that through working with nature's cycles combined  with their loving attention to the welfare of their cows, they have captured the secret to a wonderful tasting and ultimately health sustaining product.

review/summary: Get only this Vedic Ghee for food !!!!
review/text: I am very sensitive and observant to everything I eat and I am a very picky eater. I bought Ghee to practice spirituality better because Ghee is divine.<br /><br />In Bhagavad Gita it says, "The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not necessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate."<br /><br />Control of the taste buds and rising above favoritism of foods and hence emotions and life situations to seek Bliss is easier when using Ghee. Ghee imparts a love-like feeling to each morsel of food you put on the tongue, the inherent taste of the food substance is amplified by the divine feeling of Ghee. But the taste buds do not retain the taste because Ghee renders them unable to do so. So if you are Blissful spiritual seeker and eat a savory meal with Ghee, you are able to hold onto this bliss feeling undisturbed after meal.<br /><br />Ancient organics Ghee scores at the top, in fact it is the only Ghee out of top three in Amazon to have this love-like quality in it. I am thinking its because of the Vedic way in which it is prepared while Mantras are being chanted. Even the bottle label has  Mahamritunjaya mantra and Gayatri Mantra written on it. It has a great smell that reminds you of pure love and the taste is not so strong, feels just right. It is easily assimilated into body and it does not feel like I just ate a spoon full of lard. The other two Ghees "Purity Farm" and "Grassfed Organic" caused a heavy bloated feeling especially in the heart area like whatever fat I just ate got deposited there instantly. If you are serious about getting Ghee for health only buy Ancient Organics. I went to their site and bought the 32 Oz jar for $47 shipping included and I think using a teaspoon everyday it will last me two months minimum.

review/text: I have been trying the some of the numerous Ghee's that are available on Amazon and Ancient Organics Ghee is by far and away the best flavor, consistently good quality of all the others that I have tried. Most other Ghee's are very strong in flavor almost like the phony butter oil that you use on popcorn. Ancient Organics is not the cheapest, but it is the best. Ghee can be used in anything that requires butter. It does not contain salt. I use it on garlic bread, saut&eacute;ing  vegetables, frying eggs, etc. Since it is clarified butter, you find that you do not need as much when you use it. A little bit goes a long way.

review/text: Recently I was trying to find and taste the BEST sardine that is available in the market and came across a list of sardines that a person had tried.  He rated this sardine as the number 1 sardine in his list.<br /><br />After paying a fortune specially on shipping in getting this sardine, I could not wait to taste it.  I met my first obstacle when trying to open it.  It comes with a pull ring and you have to pull the metal cover off the can by pulling the ring.  It was very risky because it was hard to pull it and I almost cut myself.  Some manufacturers of sardine like Seasons had already changed the top part of their sardine can from metal to foil paper (sold in Costco) so that they could be easily opened.<br /><br />Once I opened the can (not completely), I found a few skinless and boneless sardines that were packed separately inside the can.  There were so few of them (like 4 or 5) and they were so tiny and there was simply more olive oil than sardines.  It almost seems like they are swimming inside the can.<br /><br />Well, I took a bit of them.  Not bad but not that great either.  Beside the fact that I can remove them easily (they are so far apart from each other), their tastes are not any different than the much cheaper Seasons sardines I got from Costco.  Only difference is that the Seasons sardines were packed so tightly (you get more sardines though) when I tried to remove them, they all got crushed.<br /><br />I cannot really say this is the best sardine I have ever tried and to pay almost $[...] (after paying shipping) a can for it, I do not believe it is worth the money.  You are better off going to Target or Wal-mart and buy the sardines there.  Costco will be much cheaper also.

review/text: I won't mention any brand names as I don't know the intricacies and implications of what are known as "food disparagement laws," but to say that you could do just as well to buy the tinned fishing bait that sells for $1.19 a can at your local grocery as to buy Angelo Parodi brand is just ludicrous.  Trust me, I have tried dozens of different brands of sardines, and these are just flat-out delicious.  They have a very mild flavor, almost like tuna.  Though your cat will come running when he gets a whiff of these, they are not extremely "fishy" like brands of poorer quality.<br /><br />Face it.  If you don't like sardines, you won't like these.  Nor would you like any other brand.  However, if you love sardines and have discriminating tastes, i.e., you know the difference between garbage and a truly fine, gourmet product, then these sardines are the best you are going to find.<br /><br />Still need more convincing?  Go to your preferred search engine and look up "the great sardine taste-off" and see which cannery got the honor of best-tasting sardine.  I found them wonderful and delicious, and hope you do too.<br /><br />To make this worth your while by the time you pay shipping, I would order at least 5 cans.  I did.  And I was not sorry.  I've got one can left and I'm leaving it to age in the pantry until the snacking occasion arises when nothing but a truly fine and delicious sardine will fit the bill.

review/summary: Sardines
review/text: I am one of those fishermen who like sardines with crackers.  I had read that sardines from the coast of Portugal are among the best, so I gave these a try.  Though pricey, they are good, especially when drained and treated with fresh squeezed lemon and a little salt.  Recommended.

review/summary: They got sardines in my olive oil!
review/text: I tried my first can of these exact sardines (for about half of what it costs here and purchased at a local deli/bakery store) and I found chunks of sardines not exactly "packed like sardines".  These sardines got first class tickets apparently, so they had plenty of room.  Nothing wrong with the taste, but I've had as good or better for less where the can was genuinely packed-to-the-gills with fish.

review/summary: Yummy sardines
review/text: I read about these sardines on a food site where someone had posted a list of 54 sardine varieties he had sampled and said this one was the best. I decided to give this brand and variety a try. The shipping is high but not if you order a bunch of cans at once, which is what I did (ordered 10, shipping was the same as for 1). I've eaten several cans already and they are indeed delicious. Very nice on a cucumber and sweet pepper salad, using the olive oil for part of the dressing. Next time I will buy 20 cans.

review/summary: Warning: LOW SODIUM brand
review/text: The description on this item does not specify that this is the LOW SODIUM Homestyle Chicken Noodle, though the  picture does say so if you look closely.  Sadly, Campbell's appears to have discontinued the regular Homestyle chicken noodle (I cannot find it in any grocery stores, or online) and only offers the healthy request and low sodium options.  The low sodium is AWFUL!!  The flavor is completely flat and almost tasteless, and adding salt does not improve it.<br /><br />I can understand offering healthier options for parents and others who need to avoid sodium, but I'm ticked off that Campbell's has taken away the regular flavor.  I will say that the price here is reasonable - Campbell's soups are approaching $2 a can in many supermarkets - especially if you subscribe.  I would happily subscribe if this were the regular Homestyle.  As it is, I can't recommend this flavorless soup.  I'd rather make my own.

review/summary: Best frozen chicken Tikka Masala
review/text: This is simply the best frozen chicken tikka masala I've found--far better than Ethnic Gourmet or other competing brands.  I eat this at least once a week.  The creamy sauce is great with rice, the chicken is juicy, and the spicing is just right.  Most Indian restaurants don't even produce as good a chicken tikka masala as this one.

review/summary: No cause for concern over product changes here
review/text: Despite the odd message about the product being changed to little 9oz boxes which include rice, my latest batch is the regular 10oz sauce-n-meat, sans rice, as advertised.<br /><br />It loses 1 star because the chicken doesn't exactly come across as chicken tikka. Anyone that's had this in a restaurant will know it normally has a yummy orange colored covering marinaded a few mm into the meat, whereas this is just a basic roasted/marinaded chicken. It's not horrible by any means, but having had this dish way too many times for good health, both sides of the Atlantic, you may be a little disappointed if that's what you're expecting.<br /><br />You can enhance the sauce by adding more cilantro and a teaspoon of chili-powder.<br /><br />Something that was rather disconcerting with my latest batch was 11 out of 12 boxes were opened! The sauce trays were fine, but you have to wonder why all the packets were open.<br /><br />In summary, these are the best frozen (or jar) Indian dinners I've ever had. Not restaurant standard, but definitely not the bland, over salted slop you'd normally from this kind of product. I think I'll be getting these on a very regular bases. It would be jolly nice if they give the chicken the real tikka treatment.<br /><br />UPDATE 2012-04-13:<br /><br />I'm now through 4 orders of this, or maybe it's 5. The product has been pretty consistent taste-wise, but it feels like the later batches had smaller or less chicken than the early ones. Without direct comparisons, it's hard to be precise, but my gut is telling me there has been a reduction of chicken.<br /><br />I still get a few sauce trays that are not completely sealed, but the dry ice in the shipping packaging has kept things nice and solid.<br /><br />My two local restaurants have taken quite a dive in quality over the last year, so much so, I've given up on them. I wish Tandoor Chef had a greater variety of these available sans-rice, and maybe a combo-pack. As much as I love tikka masala, it would be rather nice to have a madras or vindaloo available.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning is that my son enjoys the packaging's dry-ice, which we dump in water. A little bonus :D<br /><br />UPDATE 2012-05-29:<br /><br />It turns out I've ordered these 8 times now, so I've bumped it up to 5 stars! The last batch felt like it had a little more meat than the previous two order too.<br /><br />These aren't always available either. So if you're tempted, you'll need to get them when you see them. They could unavailable for a few weeks when you come back.

review/summary: Delicious but not healthy
review/text: These meals are really good - not fine dining but we are, after all, talking about a "tv dinner" right? In that context this stuff is really good. However, that said, it's high in fat (greasy) and needs rice to go along with it as it is very soupy.  Still, was a nice change from the usual frozen pizza night and enough that (with rice) one meal served the two of us just fine. Highly recommended for the frozen meal eating crowd. Also, we got a whole bunch of them and they arrived in good condition, completely frozen - so no worries on that front.

review/summary: Best Indian Food and Best Frozen Meal I have ever had!
review/text: Tandoor Chef Chicken Tikka Masala is the Best Indian Food and Best Frozen Meal I have ever had! It does not taste like any frozen meal I have had, and it tastes as good, if not better than the local Indian Food eatery. I am so amazed that this is a frozen meal and I am so pleased that Tandoor Chef is so affordable. Also, Tandoor Chef does not give me any stomach problems, yet most other frozen food makers of all types do. I am blown away how good this stuff tastes, how much it fills me up, and how affordable (and easy!) it is! The chicken is very tender, very juicy and it tastes like someone just spent hours in my kitchen! There is plenty of sauce included in this meal, which is excellent for my rice, etc. Amazon delivery in dry ice and packaging was perfect. I make some rice, veggies and other stuff I like and pour this meal over it; I can eat this every single day. Thank you, Tandoor Chef - for your amazing meals!

Tandoor Chef makes some of the best! , restaurant quality Chicken Tikka Masala.  The sauce alone is real tasty and can eat alone with naan. The only improvement I wish was that there was more Chicken Pieces as each box has about 4-5 square boneless chicken pieces with plenty of sauce.

review/summary: Pretty Good, better then the rest.
review/text: I'm a big fan of chicken tikka masala, and being far from any restaurants I searched and searched for something I could just reheat and chow down on.  I'd tried the Jyoti and found it tasted much to similar to MREs for my taste.<br />This stuff actually tastes like chicken tikka masala.  It's not perfect, but it's close enough.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with it was the fact that they ship it with dry ice, and when that all evaporated... the boxes got soggy.  Compound this with the fact that the adhesive keeping the plastic covering on the bowl has the strength of watered down elmer's glue... I was in for a nasty mess when I opened the box.  So, out of the 12, I lost about three.<br /><br />I'm sure had I not shipped it all the way out to Iraq, they would have made it frozen and intact.  I'll probably end up buying more of these though.

review/text: I will start by saying I did not by this on Amazon so I cannot speak to this seller.<br /><br />I can say that the product as a whole is very good.  I buy the chicken with rice from my local grocery store and have been very impressed with it.  It is remarkably better than competing brands.<br /><br />I would prefer if the serving was larger, but am not certain I'd buy the box of only chicken without rice.  The reason for that being that I want to throw something in the microwave and make a meal.  I don't want to have to make my own rice or other side.  That being said, it's not like the chicken and rice is a small serving.<br /><br />Perhaps that just speaks to how mch I like the product.  My only "complaint" is that I want more of it per box.

review/summary: Tremendous product quality and speed
review/text: I was a bit unsure about the product from some of the reviews, which mentioned a lower quality rice included version.  Rest assured, this is the original one without rice.  I was astounded and extremely pleased with the shipping speed from this seller.  I ordered mid-day Thursday (and marked "Super Saver Shipping" as they instruct for expedited shipping) and received the product on mid-day Friday (21 hours later!) even though Amazon had quoted an expected delivery the following Tuesday.  Signature was not required for delivery, which is good for people without that flexibility.  There was a very small amount of dry ice left in the package, and all contents were cold.  Considering free overnight shipping, the price for this is really low.  Great value for a product that is almost impossible to find/replicate (near restaurant- quality frozen Tikka Masala).

review/text: I was sick of everything offered in my local stores so I thought that Amazon might have something new for me to try. Buying over $50 of something I hadn't tried was risky, but it paid off. My whole family loves it! It has just the right amount of spiciness, it is rich but not oily, and the chicken is cooked perfectly. The fact that each box feeds two (or one VERY hungry person) means it is even a great value. Now I'm going to have to go eat some. Yum.

review/summary: In a lot of ways better than the curry house!
review/text: Love this stuff!  After moving to a new town we were missing our old Curry place.  After a few tries at local restaurants we were unfortunately unable to find a suitable replacement.  So we gave these a shot, and it was as good as some of the other reviews.  I am impressed with how velvety and creamy the sauce is despite being warmed up in a microwave.  The flavor is intense, however given that we're used to "British" levels of heat the dish is a bit on the mild side.  However, with a little addition of Garam Masala and  a few chili flakes you can adjust the heat of the dish without messing up the subtle layers of flavor. In addition, quite a money saver given that you get 5-6 meals for about the same price as a night out for curry.<br /><br />Almost forgot, with the extra sauce and some sauteed potatoes you can make a great "Aloo Tikka Masala".

review/summary: Excellent alternative to dining out
review/text: First of all, I'd like to note I did get the item described. There was no rice in my frozen dinners. I read some of the other reviews and was a little concerned, but it turned out okay.<br /><br />Shipping evaluation: I was hesitant to buy this item because frozen foods can be tricky when shipped. It gets very hot here in the summer, 90+ degrees is typical in the months of June through August, and is not unusual in May to get above 90. It had been in the mid nineties when I ordered this, so I made sure to be here when it was due to arrive. It didn't ship right away, but once I got the shipment notification it was here the next day. It ships in an insulated Styrofoam container with dry ice. It was quite frozen when I fetched it off my porch, but I picked it up within minutes of it's arrival. I can't say how it would have stood up on a 95 degree day for more than 7 hours out there, but grabbing it right away kept it nice and cold. I wouldn't worry about that at all during the Fall, Winter and early Spring months. Very nicely packed, and once shipped, very speedy.<br /><br />Meal evaluation: I used to live in the Detroit area and had many options for Indian food both in restaurants and shopping. Of the prepackaged stuff that requires no cooking, this is one of the best. The flavors are right, and the meat is generally good. In this one, the chicken for the most part is nice white pieces of meat. I've only ever had one of these that has a fattier dark piece of meat in it, and I've eaten quite a few over the years. Some people would say it's better than restaurants, I would say it's the best non-restaurant Indian I've eaten. I've had a dish called Butter Chicken that is similar to this tikka. Some of the tikkas I've had were a bit heavier on the spices, and this is actually fairly mild spice-wise. It is definitely enough for two people for dinner, and is not too bad calorie-wise. I've had it both on plain rice and Basmati rice. It really is better on the Basmati rice, as that rice cooks a little dryer and has a more complimentary flavor.<br /><br />Price Evaluation: I've purchased this at several places. Unless you are lucky enough to live near a discount ethnic food place like a Global Foods Market or a Trader Joe's, this price ($4.75 a dinner) is actually pretty good. I've been to Indian grocers that charge more than this, and in the ethnic food isles at the general grocery store it tends to be about 10-20% more than this price. So it's definitely worth it if you don't mind 12 boxes taking up your freezer space.

review/summary: as close to India as you'll get without actually being there!!
review/text: I'm not indian and i don't play one on tv. :-)  But I have to say the brand "Tandoor Chef", especially their chicken and lamb dishes, are soooo out of this world as close to what you'll get to actually eating at a real indian restaurant.  I LOVE indian food and have eaten at many indian restaurants and bought many brands of indian ready to eat meals in Indian groceries and Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and my local Safeway supermarket but one day I went into this small Indian grocery store which had just recently opened up in the city and they sold "Tandoor Chef" frozen foods which I never tried before so I tried a few of their dishes.<br /><br />I'm used to tame indian frozen foods at Trader Joe's and by Amy's, etc., but when I compared Tandoor Chef's frozen dishes to theirs, they seemed like PALE americanized versions compared to the REAL spiciness, savory sauciness of Tandoor Chef.  Tandoor Chef gives you more than enough chicken or lamb for the relatively small price you're paying, too in comparison to most other frozen indian food versions currently in mainstream markets.  Buy some garlic naan (indian flatbread) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GP405S">Tandoor Chef Garlic Naan, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a> along with it and finish off the sauce by soaking your naan (like dipping bread in clam chowder) in the spicy sauce for a complete meal.  And don't forget you need to cool your fiery palate down with each hot bite with a cool raita made of sour cream (or yogurt) with sliced cucumbers.  I usually also add loose leaf lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and small thin slivered carrot bits to my raita, sort of like a salad. Instead of dessert, finish your meal down while cooling down your palate with the smooth refreshing indian yogurt mango smoothie-like drink while eating your meal with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J1B136">Rasna Lassi Mix Mango</a>  or  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XHFG70">Rellure Kesar Mango Pulp, 30-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a>  which is a lot more cooling than drinking iced water or other cold drink.<br /><br />Tandoor Chef's dishes are a delight to eat that you shouldn't pass up if you really love indian food or you love spicy food AND you don't have the time/money to go to a real indian restaurant.<br /><br />Their "Tandoor Chef Masala Dosa" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZKCQL2">Tandoor Chef Masala Dosa, 14-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> is also good, not as main meals but as appetizers or light brunch break snacks.

I decided to give this one a try and its the best indian frozen food I've had hands down.  Obviously it can't compare to tikka masala cooked from scratch, but I find it a real pain to cook indian dishes from scratch on a college schedule on a college budget.  Get this! It's worth it.

review/text: I bought this at my local grocery store that sold $2 more from what Amazon is selling so I decided to do my Chicken Tikka Masala shopping here on Amazon instead.<br />This product is so goooood its better than sex, lol.<br />My friends and I were eating this and we coulnt get over how amazing it tasted, even if you are full you just wanna have more.<br />If you haven't had Indian food before then you MUST try this, I can guarantee you will love it.<br />The spicing is JUST right, not too much salt and not too much pepper!

review/summary: Tandoor Chef is reaping us off!
review/text: My whole family loves this and has been eating it for years. However, Tandoor Chef has now added rice to it (actually, half rice and half chicken which is not what the box shows you) and still charging the same price! What a rip off. I don't want rice with it, I want to eat it with Naan. And if they are going to reduce the chicken by half, shouldn't the price come down because really, how expensive is rice compared to chicken!? I am now looking at other brands because it is now too expensive to eat this on a regular basis. Shame on you Tandoor Chef.<br /><br />(The picture that is shown at this link, and the product description does not say it has rice. I wonder how accurate it is because I have not been able to find this at any of the stores. I can only hope Tandoor Chef will revert to just the Chicken Tikka Masala with NO rice.)

review/summary: For a frozen dinner? Yeah!
review/text: Ok, this isn't amazing restaurant style quality. However, it's pretty darn tasty and exactly what you were hoping to taste (at least think about tasting) as you eye the box nervously. Again, not super amazing taking the place of restaurant/fresh cooked by grandma quality, but that's like expecting a frozen hungry man to beat out fresh KFC (not gonna happen, and that's through no fault of Hungry Man!). So for what it is (as opposed to what it's not), 5 stars. If you happen to get the style with rice, if you mix them together it's fine. Really wish naan was included though.

review/summary: Tandoor Chef ruined this product
review/text: I have been a HUGE fan of this product for a long time, but now, in the version at grocer's freezer they cut the portion in HALF and add some cruddy rice and charge the same price!!! I complained to the company and they responded that "a lot of consumers asked that we add rice" (yeah... sure they did. They just wanted to improve their profit margin so they cut the portion in half) I can't order a CASE of this stuff, I live in an apt. so I won't be having any more Tandoor Chef :( Greedy so-and-sos!<br /><br />This review is not against AMAZON - no problem with amazon.com but I'm very bummed at Tandoor Chef.<br />(but really, they ship frozen food???)

review/summary: Natural way to clean teeth
review/text: When my dog had her teeth professionally cleaned, the vet said we should use Dentastixs to help keep them clean.  When I went to the pet store I was so happy to see there was a natural choice for those of us who are feeding an all natural diet.  My dog loves them and can't wait to get one after every meal.  I am so happy Amazon.com carries them because now I cannot find them in any of the pet stores I shop in.

review/summary: Denta Stix
review/text: My dog has had surgery two years in a row for bladder stones and the only treat she is allowed is the "natural" denta stix.  Our local grocery store always carried them but discontinued them.  What was I to do?  Then I thought of Amazon.  Sure enough I was able to order a whole box of them and the icing on the cake was that it was cheaper to do this than buy them individually from the store.  Amazon to the rescue again!

review/summary: Works great.
review/text: This is the most economical way that I have found to buy this product.  They are small, which is good for my dog.  Any treat, bigger than these she feels need to be hidden away for the future. (She's forever worrying if we'll find her "hidden" treasures.)  They DO help keep her teeth clean and breath better, (if not minty fresh) She gets 2 - 3 a day.  They are her reward for getting her feet cleaned when she comes in from her walks each day. She knows the drill: leash off, feet wiped down and then Dentastix! Our friends remark at how well trained she is. Truth is that she's smart enough to know how to get her treats from us.  Works every time.

review/summary: Dogs love them and benefit from them as well
review/text: One of the better treats for dogs that is not only a snack they will love but actually cleans their teeth and gums. My pooch was building up serious tarter but once we found Dentastix his teeth and gums made a 99% recovery. I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: My Guys love these...
review/text: Ever since I started giving my 2 lil Maltese males these treats they stopped eating any others. There great treats and they do work at reducing the plaque on their teeth. They get 2-3 of em everyday usually when I'm leaving the house and their very happy. Good product with good results...

review/summary: Clean teeth Bad breath
review/text: With daily use I have seen an improvement in my dog's dental hygiene. She can be uncooperative when it comes to brushing so Dentastix have come in handy. I enjoy the cleaner teeth, but, as noted in another post, I was concerned about weight gain. Fortunately, I have not seen a problem thus far.<br /><br />These treats also tend to be eaten very quickly due to their soft chewy consistency, also posted about this product. Is this texture critical to the dental cleaning action of the treat or would a longer lasting formula be possible?  This would engage the dog's attention longer and possibly clean better over a longer interval of time.<br /><br />Last, as I echo another post, the treat does little to mitigate halitosis.  Other dental treats claim to be able to do more by including additives, such as enzymatic or flavored ingredients. Do they really work and should Dentastix do the same? On the other hand, brushing never seemed to eliminate the problem for long either.<br /><br />Despite my caveats, Dentastix has improved my dog's oral hygiene significantly and for that I recommend this product.

review/summary: NOT good for dogs that chew
review/text: I'm sure these are great for other dogs but my dachshunds are garbage disposals and they eat these things in literally less than 30 seconds.  They're too soft; they just bite off chunks and swallow them, which doesn't help their teeth at all. My dad insists on giving them dentastix every day, but their breath is still putrid.  I've heard people complain about the smell but I've never really noticed it.  Anyway it's probably good for dogs that aren't big chewers, but they're not good for my dogs.

review/summary: DOGGIE BREATH
review/text: Dogs love them which makes me happy.  I ran out!  I need to order more.  They are getting older and starting to show problems with their teeth, i.e. loose teeth, gingivitis, bad breath, plaque and tartar.  This product seems to help and they certainly enjoy chomping on them and often look for more!  Good stuff!!

review/summary: One of the best and well worth every penny...
review/text: Alto Grande coffee is served at my layover hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  I always look forward to drinking it while in San Juan.  I have purchased the 5 lb. bag of whole been Super Premium Alto Grande coffee several times and find it is well worth every penny.  If you are a serious coffee lover, this truly is one of the World's best coffees.  It brews a rich yet delicate, smooth and flavorful cup of coffee you'll want to share with your friends and family.  Try it, see why it was once reserved only for The Vatican and royalty.

review/summary: It's ok
review/text: This doesn't have the same flavor I remember when I drank these coffees in Hawai'i.  The packaging changed and apparently, so did the formula.  It tastes so-so.  For me, it tastes like a diluted version of the Hawai'i experience. Too bad because this Irish Creme was one of my favorites.
