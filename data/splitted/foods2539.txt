review/summary: Better than Starbuck's French Roast
review/text: For the last few years, I've ground my own Starbucks French Roast in my coffee maker.  When the coffee maker broke, I ordered the Breville K-Cup coffee maker (a great productBreville BKC700XL Gourmet K-Cup Single-Serve Coffeemaker With Coffee Cups And Perfect Pod Holster).  To my dismay, Starbucks doesn't offer k-cups.  I order the filter baskets, and attempted the make your own cups.  Just didn't taste up to par.<br /><br />Online, I noticed folks were comparing Tully's with Starbucks, so I ordered them.  Wow, am I sold.  Tully's is fabulous.  Starbucks lost a customer and Tully's gained one.  The taste of this coffee is superb.  Bold, strong and flavorful.  I am so glad I ordered the 2-pack.  I'll be back for more!

review/text: I've tried many different brands and types of coffee K-Cups, but this one is my most favorite, hands down.  Great flavor, strong but not too strong, low acidity and the aroma is just amazing.  For me, this is THE BEST K-Cup on the market.  I drink it in the morning, and afternoon and just love it.

review/summary: Burnt Offerings
review/text: I have a Keurig B60 and have used it with a variety of coffee 'k cups' for several months now.  I was a little disappointed in the Tully French Roast.<br /><br />Now let me quantify that I  I tend to like my coffee "light and sweet".  I also find French Roasts to typically be among my least favorite types of coffee.<br /><br />I do sometimes opt for a bold cup of java.  However, I find the Tully French Roast to be more bitter than bold.  I've tired different cup size setting on the Keurig, but the Tully French Roast keeps resulting in a bitter cup of coffee.  It really had a burnt taste to it.<br /><br />I went so far as to run the same k cup through the Keurig twice to see if the Tully coffee was simply too bold for my taste.  I realize k cups are not intended for re-use but I was trying to figure out if the coffee was just too bold for my taste or really just bitter.<br /><br />SEE TIP AT BOTTOM OF REVIEW.<br /><br />While the second cup of coffee was on the weak side, it was still drinkable....however, just like the first, it was bitter.<br /><br />Where the Keurig is concerned I have found the best bold cups to be the Newman's Own Organic "Extra Bold" and the Emeril's "Big Easy Bold".<br /><br />Again, while not a huge fan of French Roast, I liked the Timothy's World "French Roast"; that brand is what you would expect, a nice cup of bold coffee.  The Tully's - just bitter.<br /><br />TIP:  While you probably don't want to reuse k cups as a regular practice, it does not hurt the machine, so if you like your coffee mild or want to cut down on costs, here is what you do.  Brew a cup of coffee using the k cup of your choice.  Then, go through the brewing process again: simply leave the used k cup in and lift and reclose the handle when the unit displayed 'Ready To Brew'.  This is best done with the small cup setting, otherwise your coffee will not be mild, but just plain weak.

review/summary: Delicious but Not Optimal for Diabetics
review/text: I picked up Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Raw Blue Agave recently because it was on sale at a local health food store. I had already made up my mind, after scouting my local stores to no avail, to purchase the Volcanic Nectar brand online but decided to give this a shot because Volcanic Nectar only has one option available (midway in color between Wholesome Sweeteners' lighter option and this one), whereas this looked like a nice alternative for a dark, "amber" variety; claims to be both raw and blue; and was displayed right in front of me (I was already primed to buy blue agave nectar, so what the heck...I wanted to believe). I was very pleased when Wholesome Sweeteners returned Sucanat to its wholesome, hand-made/minimally processed origins and so felt confident buying this product because they take their sweeteners and their organic/Fair Trade status very seriously (despite the strong case for Volcanic Nectar on their site, including their claim that color in blue agave nectar, unlike maple syrup or honey, is immaterial).<br />This is a delicious sweetener--very versatile, with many possible uses, and which can often be substituted for honey in recipes (be careful though, because certain of its properties are quite different; also be aware that fructose is the predominant simple sugar in agave's profile and that its fruity taste might not complement certain foods); the price is usually fairly low, too  for agave nectar. However, Volcanic Nectar--which owns its manufacturing facility--really does produce the only PURE blue agave nectar for sale in the US and the ONLY one that displays Diabetic Friendly certification by the Glycemic Research Institute--THE ONLY AGENCY OF ITS TYPE RECOGNIZED BY THE FDA AND FTC--on its product label. I was able to determine by the glucose level--28%--indicated for Wholesome Sweeteners on their Web site which producer (I thought Nekutli but it was pointed out to me that IIDEA is right on the label) processes their agave products and indeed, it has additives (despite claims on their Web site and toll-free calls to customer service to the contrary--this apparently has to do with Mexico's somewhat cavalier labeling laws). A chemical analysis of pure blue agave nectar should list ONLY fructose, glucose, and inulin--any other sugars in the profile indicate additives that are potentially harmful to diabetics/hypoglycemics. This is a delicious product but is not certified safe for diabetics. Wholesome Sweeteners' site claims a GI of "39 or less," which is much higher than that of Volcanic Nectar; these figures are still below the &lt;55 determined to be safe for diabetics, but their nutritional profile also indicates the presence of other sugars. For diabetics looking for safe, alternative, natural sweeteners, Volcanic Nectar, with its incredibly low GI of 27 and no additives of any kind, is the blue agave nectar of choice (it, too, is delicious although much fruitier than Wholesome Sweeteners, and their FAQ claim processing at a low enough temperature to qualify as "raw" ).<br />The bottom line: if you have no blood sugar problems and want an alternative sweetener that tastes good and isn't too expensive, this is fine. I like its darker, less fruity flavor, but I'll be sticking with Volacanic Nectar when the bottle's empty.<br />And for the record, I have no professional/personal connection with either of the firms cited in this review; I'm just a consumer who assumes that, like me, people want the ammunition required for making informed decisions.

review/summary: Better than sugar, honey or sugar substitute!
review/text: In order to avoid using sugar in my coffee (for the last 10 years - I only drink one cup a day), I started using honey as my sweetener 30 years ago. In August of 2006 I read about Raw Blue Agave and it's growing acceptance as a substitute for sugar. My only concern, "would it leave a funny after-taste?" My answer, NO! This is truly an excellent product that's inexpensive, sweet, and according to the label, it has a low glycemic index. The label also states the there are 60 calories per one measured tablespoon - I use about one-half teaspoon for my coffee. So all you people that are using the junk fake sugars in those small packets....try this product. It's safer, no chemicals and natural. BTW- I have absolutely no connection with this company.

I will definitely order this again from Amazon unless I can find the same quality agave syrup locally for a lesser price.

The taste is mild, difficult to describe -- something like a blend of honey, light molasses and caramel, but less aggressive.  You may like it straight by the spoonful.  It's great with cereal and in baked goods.  And definitely try drizzling some over fresh grapefruit.

I will reorder again soon and will copntinue to purchase this product.  The quality, the taste are just want I needed to add to my very new raw lifestyle.

review/text: I purchased this product because I find honey to be a little strong tasting in my hot tea.  I'm not a fan of putting sugar in my tea - so I wanted something that I could just squeeze in like honey but not have the strong taste.  I had previously purchased the lighter agave (more processed) but wanted to try the raw agave.  After a month of using it, I have decided that I like the taste of the raw (dark) better.  It sweetens my tea without any funny aftertastes.  I love the convenience of just squeezing a big in my cup before I put the cup in the microwave.  It seems to blend without stirring once the water is hot.  I haven't tried the raw agave in any baking products or coffee so I can't comment on it's other uses.

review/summary: Great Product, small bottles
review/text: Firstly, the product itself - good taste, excellent sweetener, easy to use. It is sort of expensive, so I only buy it on sale. I prefer honey for most sweetening applications, but the agave nectar is actually easier to use, as it is somewhat less viscous and dissolves more easily.<br /><br />On another note, I have never had trouble with the packaging, which is often a problem with gooey liquid items from Amazon. There are seals under the bottle tops, plus shrink wrap over the tops, and the bottles also come shrinkwrapped together. As always, be careful in ordering liquid products through the mail. A rotting box of leaking goo is the bane of the delivery worker and an unwelcome addition to your doorstep.<br /><br />Thirdly, this product comes in other sizes/packaging. These bottles are fairly small, but six of them will last most people for a while. I recommend exploring all packaging options to get the best price, and consider Subscribe and Save as well. We can use regular shipments here at our house anyway, since we seldom use granulated sugar.

review/summary: White Sparkling Sugar is so pretty
review/text: Oh happy day!  I saw the cutest small 2-layer cakes frosted in beautiful white frosting with just a sprinkling of this sparkley sugar on the top.  I just had to have some!  And everything else to make those adorable cakes but that is another story.  I stuck some of the Wilton sugar in my cart, then all of a sudden they don't have it.  So I look on Wilton's site, and they say it's discontinued.  Huh?  Well not to be so easily defeated, I search Amazon again and find another vendor who evidently still has some.  Well, it came today in a box full of other treasures in my order, and it's gorgeous.  1/2 pound, won't last forever but will use it just for certain things.

review/summary: Pure Happiness
review/text: This is my favorite gluten-free pasta.  When I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease my dietitian recommended Tinkyada.  I tried it and was very disappointed.  I avoided pastas altogether for a while.  A few weeks ago I went to the Old Spaghetti Factory with a friend and tried their gluten-free pasta.  I was beyond happy (my friend possibly thought I was insane... she just doesn't realize).  Afterwards, I went from specialty food store to specialty food store trying to find the pasta they used.  I am certain that it is Mrs. Leeper's.  It is very easy to cook and cooks rapidly.  The texture is fabulous and consistent.  It goes great with any sauce.  My personal favorite is a little browned butter and a generous helping of mizithra cheese.

review/text: This pasta tastes good and it's good for dishes with thicker sauces or baked casseroles. My family really likes the dishes I make with them.

The tartness to sugar ratio could still be higher though. The orange flavor is correct and characteristic of sour oranges with Spain as the country of origin. This is the only orange marmalade still made in the historical origin city of Dundee in Scotland from my research (even the Dundee brand is not).

review/text: I have a pretty picky taste in chocolate, and this bar did not meet my expectations.  Although the dark chocolate surrounding the minty center is satisfactory, the center is much too sweet and minty.  When you bite into the square, you get a nice chocolate flavor, but it is soon overrun by a proportionally large amount of filling with an incredibly minty and terribly sweet taste.  Additionally, there are way too many unnatural ingredients in this chocolate (especially part of the mint center), so I'm not a big fan on the health credentials of this either.

The 6g of saturated fat doesn't really bother me, but trans fats (in any product) do. Therefore, I can't really enjoy them and am going to give most of them away. For taste alone (disregarding the trans fat content), I'd give these 4 stars. They're pretty good taste-wise. But overall, I'd say these are only worth 2 stars based on its aforementioned ingredient issue. There are plenty of sweets and chocolates out there with better ingredients.

Although both Nong Shim Bowl Noodle are high in sodium and probably around the same level with regard to nutritional value, this bowl of soup although not intended to act as a complete meal, can certainly be a good portion of a meal, adding on additional side dishes like a bowl of rice, a fried egg, or eaten with a Korean favorite "kimchee."

review/summary: Must buy for quick meals on the go
review/text: I've eaten these noodles for a while now and for the starving artist, it's a great alternative to the spicy ramen umma prepares at home. :)  It's really easy to make--open it up slightly, take the seasoning packet out, poor boiling water in, add the seasoning packet, and keep the package closed for 2-3 minutes to allow it to cook.  It cooks very quickly and can be eaten right away.<br /><br />It comes in several flavors, but in my opinion, the best one is kimchi--this truly is spicy and will leave your nose running.  The noodles have somewhat of an al dente texture, which I like, but others may not like this.  You can easily add other ingredients to this if ramen alone isn't enough; I personally add extra kimchi and seafood.  Some people add eggs for extra protein.<br /><br />The entire bowl contains around 500 calories and a LOT of sodium, so if you're on a diet, obviously this isn't a good choice.  But if you don't mind the calories or sodium, this is a great, quick meal that cooks in minutes.

review/text: The Hot and Spicy Nong Shim Noodle Bowl definitely delivers on its promise of spiciness. When I first tried this product I couldn't believe the heat level. But that's what kept me coming back for another bite. The flavor is salty, but appealing. I should say here that I consider jalapeno peppers to be spicy.<br /><br />The Noodle Bowl is easy to prepare. All that's needed is to pull back the bowl's cover halfway, to add boiling water to the level indicated, to cover the bowl back up and to wait a few minutes until the noodles have steamed.<br /><br />In addition to the noodles, there are colorful little wafers that taste like seafood. There are probably 3 or 4 of these in the bowl. There are also roughly 2 little yellow pellets that I believe are egg. There's a bit of diced green onion, as well.<br /><br />Two things I wish I'd have been aware of before developing a fondness for this product is that one serving is half the bowl, and also the nutrition data.<br /><br />380 calories for whole bowl [Hereafter abbreviated to WB.]<br />160 calories from fat [WB]<br />16 grams fat [WB]<br />1840 mg of Sodium [WB]<br />50 grams Carbohydrates [WB]<br />8 grams Protein [WB]

Not the best choice if you are on a diet or have food restrictions BUT it tastes really good and certainly healthier than some fast foods. I myself only eat them once in a while. The other flavors in this brand I didn't care for but this one is a winner for sure!

review/summary: my favorite flavor of the Yummy Earth candies
review/text: these are organic. I'm a big fan of the movies <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027BOL4G">Food, Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EP8EOY">King Corn (Standard Packaging)</a> which focuses on how most of our foods are made from corn. The corn I speak of isn't a corn you'd want to eat because this type of corn has been sprayed with disgusting pesticides etc. Essentially, this is what candies are made of. They are labeled as several different names you wouldn't recognize, but mostly you'll see high fructose corn syrup. Knowing this, I went out and bought the variety pack of this candy as a healthy substitute.  I must honestly say that a few of the flavors really were disgusting, and I immediately spit them out. I was giving bags away. Curiosity got the best of me though, and I wanted to know what the ginger flavor tasted like. YUMMY! spicy and sweet! I was hooked and have been buying this candy ever since. If you try one flavor, try this one. Best of all, NO CORN SYRUP!

review/summary: More Spice Cake than Raw Ginger Bite
review/text: Very tasty candies. These are definitely heavy on candy ... light on Ginger. I would actually say these just have a hint of ginger in them. To my taste these do not compare at all to other ginger candies that immerse you in more of a raw ginger flavor. If you're looking for that, go with Gin Gin. These are more like hard candy versions of grandma's Spice cake ... still very yummy.<br /><br />Individually wrapped and about the diameter of a dime these are very portable and convenient. I've also found that the ginger is a quality and amount that settles my stomach after meals.

review/summary: Not the ginger candy I was hoping for
review/text: I love yummy earth's candy, especially their chili pops (which have amazing bite), so I figured I would give these a try since I LOVE ginger.<br /><br />I was hoping for a spicy, zesty (like the package says) ginger flavor. Unfortunately, the ginger is not the star of this candy. It's good, just not gingery. I think people who say they don't like ginger would like these, which I think is what yummy earth was going for- since ginger is such an acquired taste.<br /><br />I think they played it way too safe. I will probably buy from the ginger people next time, their candy is very gingery.<br /><br />I still love yummy earth's chili pops and wild peppermint drops!

review/summary: MY favorite ginger candy.
review/text: i love eating candied ginger but it gives me a sore throat. So i found these and tried them out. They do taste like ginger but don't bother my throat at all. They are more sweet than savory. My only concern is that the candies in the bag i got were a tad gummy. As if they were exposed to humidity. I like my candies to be rock hard. So that is the reason for the 4 stars, when it comes to food i'm big about texture.

review/text: Ortiz is one of the highest quality tuna available anywhere. It is prepared in olive oil and it is excellent for salads and many other dishes. This is not the typical US albacore tuna, this is a much smaller fish which increases the price but the meat is way better than any other white tuna. I am very pleased to see that Amazon keeps a continuous supply of it!

review/summary: Great to marinate meats, especially Chicken breast!
review/text: Try this as a marinade for the chicken you plan to use in a salad or sandwiches, or for grilling! Add a tsp of sesame seed oil it for more flavor, then add to chicken in a plastic bag, chill overnight in the fridge. Remove chicken to cook, then BOIL the marinade 5 minutes, uncovered, then keep chilledfor a few days, or frozen for longer keeping. (An ice cube tray makes nice portions.) The cooked marinade is safe to use as a marinade again, or as a salad dressing, because it has been BOILED (cooked) to STERILIZE it.

review/summary: Lawry's Sesame Ginger Marinade
review/text: A sweet rather than spicy marinade. More like a Teriyaki. I was hoping it would be a spicy mix more similar to a Bulgogi marinade because of the sesame seed. I have used it on chicken and beef and both were delicious. I added a few garlic cloves on the beef too which turned out even more flavorful. The meat was wonderfully moist and tender. Yellow rice is great with it. My guys are certainly not sorry I purchased it.

review/text: I have tried many kinds of bread flours, and on a gut instinct read the one review and thought, I need to try it.  I make an authentic long pre-ferment San Fran sourdough, which has no added yeast. I do believe this flour yields a good strong gluten, enabling the natural sourdough to do its thing.  The crust is just perfect, and what big loaves I get!!! And the most delicious perfect sourdough flavor ever.  I know alot about bread baking and have studied it a lot, and still I know very little.  I do know this flour is different, and am very pleased with the results.  You will need a new garbage can with a good lid as this is a LOT of flour.

review/text: I'm nearly finished using my first 50 lb bag of Honeyville Artisan Flour, and am ordering a second.  Before ordering, I contacted their customer service person, who took time to answer my questions about flour processing and content.<br />My sourdough thrives on this flour; the dough is easy to knead and form, with just the right % of gluten and malt, plus the added bonus of no bleach!<br />Just out of the oven, I can hear the caramel brown crust crackling - just like it should.  The crust is crunchy and chewy; the bread is moist and full of bubbles - a difficult combination to achieve.<br />I make 5 or 6 loaves of Austrian sourdough bread a week, enough to eat and plenty to share.  Friends and neighbors say these loaves are sooo delish. Leftover slices make wonderful French Toast.<br />The lower shipping costs make my hubby happy.

review/text: This product is amazing! Thank you Honeyville for this magnificent flour. I've finally found what I was looking for in my breads -- this absolutely makes a huge difference. The look, the taste, the crust - everything comes out as intended.  If I ever open my own bakery I know who I will be ordering my flour from.<br /><br />When compared to other flours, even the KA brand (*bread makers will know who I'm talking about*), this flour is miles apart from competition. Gluten strands develop quickly due to higher protein %, the dough comes out creamy and easy to deal with.<br /><br />This dough is perfect for baking artisan loafs, making your own pizza and spaghetti.  Now, if you are looking to bake cakes with it, don't even try. You'd have to find a more appropriate flour type for the task.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with the delivery too. It was delivered within couple of days, the sack was packaged in a box and came undamaged. The shipping charge is also quite unusual for the weight of the package. Please keep it this way though. Again, I'm very pleased with the product. Will be coming back for more. And as others have already stated, espacially if you bake often, 50Lbs is not as much as you think but should last you quite a while.

I bagged it n 1 gallon plastic bags and packed them into a large lard can to keep fresh.. the container is now in our root cellar. For my first loaf I tried a basic French Bread recipe that includes beaten egg whites added to the water.. no oil.. just flour, sugar, yeast, water, salt.. and, from 1lb 4 oz of flour I produced the most awesome, seriously authentic French  style baguettes (x2) that I have EVER made! I have no idea what makes this unbleached flour so special, but I'm not looking back!

review/summary: The best cereal...
review/text: Wheat Chex<br /><br />I never imagined that our cereal would some day be delivered via UPS, but since Amazon's free-shipping price is 1/3 lower than our local Safeway, that's where we get it.<br /><br />- It tastes great, even with the non-fat milk we've been using forever.<br /><br />- Dry cereals made from wheat are much more filling than those made from corn, rice, or oats.  I have to eat twice as much to be full, if the cereal is made from those grains.<br /><br />- It stays reasonably crunchy the entire meal, and I have a big bowl every morning.<br /><br />- It stays fresh in an opened box; although at the rate it's consumed around here, that's usually not very long.<br /><br />- It stays fresh in an unopened box for many months.<br /><br />- Good daily dose of fiber, although that's not the reason I eat it.<br /><br />- The box and inner plastic bag open easily. My wife eats a Kellogg's brand cereal and opens the inner bag with scissors, as it can't be pulled apart.<br /><br />- If you are a regular Wheat Chex customer, save 15% through Amazon's "Subscribe & Save" offer; prominently displayed on the product page.<br /><br />I've been eating this stuff for 50 years.  When I travel to a foreign country, one of the things I miss is this cereal.  Guess you could say I'm a loyal customer...

review/text: Even though Wheat Chex is a calorie-dense food with 160 calories per serving (only � cup!) we like it any way.  It is music to the mouth.  The taste is enticing.<br /><br />One of is strongest features is its huge amount of fiber.  One serving has 5 grams fiber, which is 21% of the usual daily allowance.  It is irresistible oven toasted whole grain wheat cereal.  Since nine out of ten people in this country fail to eat enough whole grain, why not try this delicious cereal?<br /><br />The price at this site is competitive at the time of this writing.  I highly recommend this cereal.  We buy it to make party mix, but I like to eat it the old fashioned way, in a bowl with banana slices or raisins and  milk.  Yum!  Sometimes I combine it with Corn Chex and Rice Chex in my bowl.  I call that cereal salad.  When it all gets mixed in there, it is good.  We have it for supper when we've eaten a big lunch.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.

review/summary: Great sugar and a great price
review/text: If you're looking for a well priced raw organic sugar with a good flavor you won't do much better than buying this from Amazon.  I really like the flavor of this sugar and while I like some of their Fair Trade sugars a little better (their non-organic Turbinado from Malawi is hard to beat) I've got little kids so I'm trying to stick with organic products when possible.<br /><br />Someone in a previous review claimed this is bleached.  They may be mistaking this for a "brown" sugar (which isn't bleached but it is refined into a white sugar [often using an acid] and then the molasses is added back in).  As the name makes clear this is a raw Turbinado sugar.  That means it is raw cane that is spun in a low speed centrifuge (i.e. "turbine") just enough to remove most of the cane plant detritus.  While this version is raw you can find plenty of Turbinado sugar that has been baked or steamed.<br /><br />You can use this sugar pretty much anywhere you've been using regular white sugar.  If you've got a recipe that calls for bakers sugar then this will probably be too coarse.  This won't melt as easily as white sugar:  I find that around 375 degrees it caramelizes nicely but at 350 I still get crunchy bits of sugar.  I kind of like the crunchy bits but if you don't turn the heat up a notch.  If you are putting this in cereal it won't dissipate as easily as plain white sugar but this isn't something that ever bothered me.  I like that is has a more interesting flavor than white sugar and that lets me use a little less of it.  Anything that helps the waste line is a good thing in my book.<br /><br />Incidentally if you are shopping around and see something called "Demerara" sugar it's just the English name for sugar made in pretty much the same way as Turbinado sugar (there are text book definitions of these things but most of the sugar makes aren't reading them so don't get too worked up about the name).

review/summary: Gosh Darn, This Stuff Is Good!
review/text: The title says it all.  Adds so-o-o-o much body and flavor to coffee, baking--anything that you'd could possibly need sugar for.  Moreover, it's actually nutritious.<br /><br />I cook for hunters at our deer camp every fall, and last year I took a half dozen pouches of turbinado raw sugar to use while I was there.  The hunters were skeptical of the stuff at first, but they were game; they gave it a try.  And just raved about how much better their coffee tasted!  Even wrote down the name of the product so they could get some when they went home.  Those guys were so funny in the mornings, lining up for their coffee and discussing the merits of this sugar as if it were going to revolutionize the universe.<br /><br />It doesn't dissolve in cold liquids and takes a few seconds of stirring in hot ones.  Smells kinda funny when you open the bag, too, but, boy oh boy!  This stuff wakes up everything I've used it in.  I've been using this sugar for going on two years--and it's been exactly that long since I bought refined sugar.  Coincidence?  I think not.<br /><br />And with Amazon Prime, it ships for free.  Fantastic product, great price.<br /><br />Nuff said.

review/summary: The crystals do not melt.
review/text: I make the crunchy shortbread cookies from the recipe on the bag constantly.  This is a clean tasting sugar but it won't melt in brownies.<br /><br />12 packs is a lot but I am nearly half way through this order and have no regrets buying in bulk.
