review/summary: Easy when you are busy
review/text: Earth best products are best quality, organic with no non-sense ingredients added to it. variety pack can be great if your baby eats all the vegetables. unfortunately, my baby do not digest squash well (gets gassy) and so economically it is not best for me to buy this variety pack. We purchased it because we were traveling and needed it to be delivered fast to our door, which was possible thanks to Amazon mom membership. Amazon price for this product was best online (especially, with no shipping cost). You can get them for little cheaper when they are on sale in retail stores.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: We all know jar food is pretty quick and easy... some are even pretty good when you aren't a baby.  I use these primarily as backup when my baby is with her sitter, or when what we are eating isn't baby appropriate.  For the most part, our baby likes these.  She does not care for the peas and brown rice, which is surprising because she loves peas and has likes brown rice cereal.

review/summary: Wish this variety pack included more green veggies
review/text: We like this variety pack, and our baby eats all four varieties and seems to like them all.  However, it's unfortunate that the only green vegetable in this variety pack is green peas.  Earth's Best also makes a spinach/potato variety and a green bean variety, and it would be nice if one of those could be included rather than three orange vegetables and only one green vegetable.<br /><br />These vegetables are very well pureed, and are perhaps even a bit too thin for older babies (our baby is 8 months old).  We like to mix in some rice cereal or oatmeal to thicken the consistency, and this seems to work well.

review/text: I am loving Earth's Best brand overall.  I set out with the goal of making all of our son's food.  However, when I returned to work full time the puree time was less.  So my go-to backup is Earth's Best Baby Food.  We're on stage two now, almost stage 3, and he loves them.  I appreciate the no added sugars / preservatives and that it's mostly organic.  He loves the taste and combos.  Good stuff, great product, LOVE IT!

review/summary: Great food - baby and toddler love it - note for Amazon
review/text: These jars of vegetables from Earth's Best seem to be the only way to get veggies into our toddler. We've thought about making our own baby food, but anyway you do the math, it just takes way too long.  Earth's Best is a good brand and I trust them when they say no sugar or salt is added.  A note to Amazon - apparently you changed the packaging on this, which is great. But I think it basically meant that you said this product with the old standard "retail packaging" was out of stock, so we thought the whole product was out of stock on subscribe and save and didn't know what to do. We actually had to buy jars at a higher price at our local grocery store. It turns out you do have it with the new "frustration free packaging" and I had to unsubscribe from the old item and subscribe to this. Might have been nice to have a note next to it where it says out of stock, something along the lines of "We have it in stock in different packaging." Or perhaps send us an email with "Earths best baby food in the subject line."  I'm sure there's software to do all that easily.  Generally, you guys make our life much easier, so when you don't, it's unusual, and I thought I should let you know.

review/summary: Packaging for delivery needs to be better
review/text: I received my first order of Earth's Best Vegetable Variety 12- pack and one of the jars were completely shattered spilling pureed peas and brown rice onto half of the other jars. I had to VERY carefully clean, wash and inspect all the other jars to make sure they weren't also broken or have any glass pieces stuck to  it. And when I am ready to use a jar to feed him, I inspect it again before feeding. Now that I think about it, I should just throw it all away to avoid any risks. I normally make my baby food at home but thought these would be convenient for on the go feedings. My 7 month old son seems to like everything and has not rejected any foods I've given him, yet. *knock on wood* Anyway, I'm sure this stuff is good. But if I decide to buy it again, it'll be in the stores.

review/summary: High Quality Treat.
review/text: It is pricey, but after reading many reviews and trying other Thai teas, finally broke down and treated my kids and I to this brand.  I have to say, it is one of my favorites now.  It brews to nice strong flavor with the dark orange color expected of a good Thai Tea.  It saves alot by being able to make it at home and my kids say it tastes just like the one at our favorite Thai restaurant.  So in the end, although it is pricier than other brands, it's still a significant savings in comparison to buying three Thai Iced Teas everytime we go.  I usually make 8 cup batches (apprx. 16 tspns of tea) which usually yields six iced teas, being you add the milk too.  My kids are very happy that they can have the same great tasting treat, but more often now!

I'm always on the hunt for coffee that's less expensive than Starbucks but meets my husband's standards.<br /><br />He loves this coffee.  When we first got it he said it'd be hard to tell a difference between this and Starbucks.  More recently he said, "That coffee is SO good!"  So, we have a winner!  I think it was on particularly good sale the first time I bought it so I'll have to keep my eye on the prices, but as long as it stays lower than Starbucks prices, it's for us!

review/summary: Bringing Back My Childhood
review/text: Remenber the days of yore, the days when this kind of salad dressing wasvthevrage? Now, we have hundreds if not thousands of brands, ready made to choose from. I loved the tart salad dressing his made. Now I add balsamic vinegar and Excellent olive oil, and this makes such a delicious salad dressing for my salads.<br /><br />The cruet is new and improved and is lovely to place on the table. The dressing is so easy to make, vinegar, water, the dry dressing mix, shake, then add olive oil. What could be simpler? A tasty treat for all of our salads. This brings back mynearlyndays as a home maker.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-15-12<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0740765353">Keeping Good Company: A Season-by-Season Collection of Recipes, with Entertaining and Homemaking Ideas</a>

review/summary: Can't beat this price!
review/text: I had been looking for this cruet set in local supermarkets without success, so was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price --- especially since I thought I was getting one cruet with two dressing packages, and the price is actually for 2 cruets and 4 seasoning packages! (This is a great price because a single package of dressing mix tends to run about $1.99 in the stores). The cruets are sturdy, come with suggestions for dressing variations, and bring back memories of when my mom used this same cruet to make salad dressing when I was a kid. Definitely recommended --- homemade salad dressing beats store dressing every time!

review/summary: EXCELLENT SOURCE OF ORGANIC GREEN NUTRITION AT THE RIGHT PRICE!
review/text: I bought this at my local "Sprouts" supermarket this week, NOT based on the various negative reviews of the product on here.  I ALMOST passed on it but basing my purchase on the nutrition facts, I decided to take a chance.  I paid $35 plus tax for it.<br />I plan to use this as part of a lunch time meal replacement.<br />Each serving contains:<br />90  Calories<br />9 g Carbohydrates<br />10g Protein<br />6 g Fiber<br />1 g Sugar (less than)<br />Those are the basic nutrition facts.  I didn't include the ample vitamins and chlorophyll info.<br /><br />Thank the heavens, I decided to take a chance and not follow the rest of these reviews because this shake is superb.  Does it dissolve perfectly? No but who cares?  I'm not sipping or nursing on it. Its not a martini. I mix it up and gulp it down.  Simple.  Also, I feel better knowing that it doesn't dissolve completely.  It gives me the impression that there are more substantial quality ingredients.  I'm not basing this on any scientific fact, just a feeling.<br />Next, the flavor is EXCELLENT.  What are these people talking about? It tastes like its trying to be a "chai" drink but of course I know that it is not and I wouldn't expect it to because I chose this item acknowledging that there was practically no "sugar."  I wouldn't go into this shake expecting a jamba juice (do you know how much sugar is in a jamba juice).  Anyone who is thinking about giving this a shot, I say take the plunge.<br /><br />For my next purchase, I'm going with one of the other flavors from this line (the sugar content in some of the other flavors ranged between 6-10g) that happens to be on sale for $25.  15 meals (per container) that comes to a cost of around $2 a pop AND nutritionally good for me, definitely my kind of lunch.

review/summary: Great nutrition! Good ... not great flavor.
review/text: A nice alternative flavor for this great green meal replacement. The vanilla chai flavor is missing the spicy chai goodness that would make this my favorite. If I had tasted it without reading the label I would have guess it was simply vanilla. I was hoping for more spicy chai. I will absolutely finish the rest of the can, however, I doubt this flavor will be making into regular rotation. It does mix up kinda green in color so if you're not into that you might want to go for something else or try an opaque container. The texture is kinda grainy but no lumps so I am perfectly pleased. I am going to try adding banana or chai concentrate to make it more interesting. I think it could be dressed up very easily so if you like to add berries (esp. blueberries) and such I believe this would lend itself well to that.

review/summary: Best shake for the price
review/text: Have tried them "all" and this is by far the best shake out there for health, nutrition, taste and price.  Was on the Shaklee cinch shake when I started looking for a cold processed shake that wasn't as pricey.  It has the lowest sugar content of all of the shakes out there and when combined with coconut milk or almond milk it can taste pretty good.  It's a little grainy because of how natural it is but it's worth it.  Busy mom with a busy schedule who needs all of the nutrients this has.  Have tried the higher end stuff which honestly I would love but simply can't afford Shakeology.

Mix well, then add a 1/2 dozen ice cubes for a frothy, frozen treat!!  This is a great meal replacement in the morning packed with protein and healthy goodness.

review/text: I mix Vanilla Chai with milk and a banana, whirl with my stick blender, and I have a pleasantly-flavored, 10 grams of protein, 6 grams of fiber meal.  And unbelievably to me, it DOES appease my appetite until the next mealtime rolls around.  I love the fact that it has very few calories on it's own, so if I use skim milk there is virtually no fat and a small amount of calories.  I have already re-purchased and I will continue to do so.

I tried mixing it in water, milk even yogurt (that was a huge mistake) and it just never tasted ok enough to choke down.  I'm not a picky eater either. I know these powders are funky, I expected that.  But this stuff was over the top funky.  When I mixed it in yogurt, it got super sticky and was sort of like wall paper paste.  It tastes nothing like chai.  I'm not sure why I they call it that.  I haven't tried making into a smoothy with lots of honey and cinnamon and other spices.  Maybe that would help it taste like chai...

review/text: I really wanted to like this product.  And in all fairness, I eat many other things people may not find palatable, like hemp protein powder and chia seeds, so I was a little surprised by my reaction to the taste of this powder.  It did mix up into a thick, rich looking smoothie.  I mixed in a banana, hemp oil, orange flavored aminos, stevia, and raw cacao powder (as I commonly mix into my hemp protein smoothie), and it still managed to really taste like nothing.  Well, I shouldn't say it tasted like nothing, it was reminiscent of grass clippings, which actually made me gag a little just thinking about it.  I plugged my nose and chugged it down, and it was filling, and full of good nutrients, but the taste....ugh!  I will definitely NOT buy this again.

I looked for ways to make it somewhat enjoyable to eat, so I dumped a packet of hot chocolate mix into it and stirred it up.  Now it tastes amazing!

Never having heard of this spice I, I looked all over my town and could not find it in any spice sections of the local stores, so I ordered here at Amazon for $11.95  The next day when I was at the local fish market I found the same sized jar for $2.50.  Never having used the spice, I have no comment on its quality, but this is way overpriced.  If you can't find this spice locally, do a internet search to find another seller.  This should not be this expensive.

review/summary: Fantastic gourmet chip - this flavor is one of the best.
review/text: I purchased these chips for my mobile vending cart. Because I have Amazon Prime the cost per bag is really good as far as a reseller goes. Each flavor is really good in its own right. These chips the Asian Sweet and Spicy are just so tasty. Its just the right amount of sweet and the slightest bit of spice that makes these a fantastic tasting chip.<br /><br />Lets talk about details:<br /><br />Chip thickness (+)<br />These are gourmet chips and the quality is there from the moment you open the bag. Each one is crunchy and not too thick but just enough to let you know you didn't buy a bag of Lays.<br /><br />Grease (+)<br />These are NOT greasy chips. Depending on the flavor they are just mildy seasoned and not coated in a heavy grease or oil.<br /><br />Flavor (+)<br />Each flavor stands completely on its own. You could do a blind taste test of each one of these flavors sold by Deep River and I bet you could tell what it was. None of the flavors are overpowering except maybe the Jalapeno flavor which is honestly too hot and I love hot food.<br /><br />Resale (+)<br />You may not resell these but at the current price and using Prime shipping the cost per bag allows you to make a decent profit.<br /><br />Overall:<br />These are great tasting, unique flavored chips that are hands down better than the ones you can get in bulk at a Sams or BJ's. Do yourself a favor and try a bag or two. I bet you'll love em like we do.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.

Hits the salty snack craving just right.  I like the size too - it's enough to satisfy a craving but keeps me from eating a whole big bag.  Which I'd probably do with these, if that's what I had.

review/text: Just to keep it simple...more of a comparison than a total review.  I love jalapeno chips - look mostly for the level of spice, then pepper flavor, good crunch, and not loaded down with salt.<br /><br />With that said, these Deep River Snacks chips (jalapeno flavor) are:<br />1. Better than the Lays Jalapeno.  (Deep RIver have the same spice level, which is lacking.  Neither have a lot of pepper flavor.)<br />2. About the same as the jalapeno chips that the "World Market" branded chips.  (World Market has a little more spice, but also a lot more salt.)<br />3. Not nearly as good as Tim's Cascade Jalapeno chips.  (Tims has more pepper flavor, more spice, a little bit better crunch...but also have MSG.)<br /><br />It's not to say these chips are bad, but just what the 3-stars says "It's OK."  There are better, there are worse...to me, these are right in the middle of the pack.

review/text: Deep River Salt & Vinegar chips are thick and crunchy.  Very tart.  So tart that I can't eat them alone. They are perfect with a sandwich though. These chips are well coated with the seasonings, maybe too much seasonings for some folks tastes.  I suggest buying a small bag before purchasing a large quantity of these.  They aren't for everyone.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Awesome Goodness! (deep river kettle chips, swt maui onion [pack of 24])
review/text: Before you turn to other name brands out there, give these a try. Although the Maui Onion can be a bit salty at times, i can still say these are amongst the crunchiest and tastiest chips I have ever had. Now i have tried both the barbeque and Asian style flavor, but still I must say these are the best. If you are looking for something to snack on that tastes good, these are the ones for you. Its better than the pringle's commercial, since these are harder to put down once you start.

review/summary: Pretty good, but prefer other jalapeno chips
review/text: I was expecting some "serious flavor" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips.

review/text: I purchased the Salt and Vinegar chips and have been very pleased. There is the right amount of vinegar, virtually every single chip I have tasted is done just right, no burned chips, and they have an excellent thickness to impart just the correct amount of potato taste.<br /><br />They go great with lunches or as a snack. They are very economical. Beats the heck in terms of quality, taste, and price to buying these at work or out and about (I bought the 2 ounce bags). I will be trying some of the other intriguing flavors. Recommended.

What you want in a potato chip: the crunch is fantastic and the flavor gives off both rosemary and olive oil, ending in a surprisingly smoky note.

review/text: These chips are very spicy to say the least, my tongue burned too much to finish the small individual serving bag. They have an overpowering amount of some Asian spice, perhaps ginger, but it is way too strong and you are left with a very unpleasant taste. I bought 24 of the small size bags but could not bring myself to like the flavor, it all ended up in the trash.  This is definitely a chip that will appeal to only certain palates. I do like the sweet onion flavor of this brand but this Asian flavor was too much of a good thing!

review/text: I loved kettle chips from the moment I tried them but I felt absolutely disgusting every time I had the Kettle Brand. Though very tasty and crunchy, they were also very oily. With Deep River Snacks, they've got the crunch and taste without that repulsive burst of oil in your mouth with each crunch that Kettle Brand had. I LOVE the Sweet Onion Maui and Mesquite BBQ. The Jalapeno flavor does spicy justice and the Rosemary & olive Oil is very unique for a chip. I wish they had a sour cream and onion flavor but I love them regardless.

review/summary: Delicious, great texture, 3 ingredients
review/text: I did a search on Amazon for Kettle reduced fat chips, hoping to find a good deal on Kettle brand chips.  I stumbled upon these Deep River reduced fat kettle chips, and liked the per bag price (works out to about $1.50 per bag, about half the price of a similarly sized bag of Kettle brand chips at my local grocery store).  I am so glad I ordered these.  I love the taste, and I love the texture, and never would have guessed they were reduced fat.  I particularly like the short list of ingredients: Potatoes, Sunflower or Corn oil, and Salt.  That's it.<br /><br />I do wish Amazon would make it easy to find the nutritional information...so, here are the basics: 12-chip serving (28g) is 120 calories, 6g fat, 1g fiber.<br /><br />I will definitely order these again.

review/text: I love salt & vinegar kettle chips so I decided to try these after reading good reviews. When I received them, I noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes! I know how kettle chips should look, and I know what normal marks look like on chips. These were rotten. After waiting over a month for a response from the company, I finally found a phone number and called them, only to be told there was nothing they could do. The sad thing is, the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty. Obviously they just don't care about consistent quality, so stay away from these chips!

There's a few broken crackers in each box, but it's about the same as the packages I buy at the local store.<br /><br />They're also much cheaper per box than at my local store.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these from Amazon again.

review/text: This stuff tastes amazing. It's lightly sweet with sparse, but juicy raisins. The texture is like bread, but it isn't light and fluffy, more dense and chewy due to the high gluten content. I found that texture extremely satisfying because it makes it feel like you're actually eating something substantial, where as a normal slice of bread this size would never feel like a real snack. I'm very impressed with the nutritional content, and as long as you're not sensitive to gluten, then this stuff is really great. It's dense and chewy, and I loved it!

review/text: If you're like me, you buy several low-carb products at once and freeze some of them. Perhaps this bread just doesn't hold up well in the freezer but I was disappointed with it. The taste is decent for a low-carb product, the texture is nice, the crust is really pretty, but it's very dry to the point that it's difficult to digest, even when slathered in butter (which I hate to do). I tried toasting it, butter, low fat cream cheese and no dice. It feels like choking down forty saltine crackers. Overall, it's decent as there aren't that many bakeries that sell low-carb breads over the internet that don't taste like manure but I would not buy it again.

You can't taste the dressing very well compared to other oil/vinegar-type dressings. It seems a little bland. Then again, salads with dandelion greens can overpower salad dressing.<br /><br />On the plus side, it isn't high in fat. And it isn't bad. Just not my thing.
