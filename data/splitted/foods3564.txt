review/summary: Nice cup of tea
review/text: Chamomile tea is my favorite and it has lots of good benefits (sleep aid, said to help with stomach aches, etc) and Stash makes great tea. Each tea bag is individually wrapped in a very tightly sealed wrapper, which I think makes the tea "fresher."  The downside is that it's not great for the environment.

review/summary: I prefer Stash tea over Tazo
review/text: I always enjoyed Tazo tea (Earl Grey being my favorite) but while at a restaurant one evening, they only carried Stash. I couldn't believe the difference in both taste & aroma, it was so much better! When using tea bags, I recommend giving it a try.<br /><br />Gina

review/summary: Nice tea
review/text: I have been drinking this tea for some time.  I happen to like Chamomile teas they are very a mild, I do not like teas that are to strong.  One bag is enough or me I can put it in a cup of hot water and leave the bag in without worrying if it was to get too strong like other teas do.  Adding just a little raw honey enhances the flavor also.<br />I enjoy this tea before I go to bed and it has a very soothing and the warmth of the liquid allows me to slip into a nice sleep.<br /><br />I like the convenience of a foil package, I can carry one or two with me when I go out to lunch with friends, I just order a cup of hot water and slip this tea into it.<br />I have on occasion I have put this is a cup with some fresh ginger and it makes a totally different tea, and he ginger helps sooth the tummy while the Chamomile tends to relax you.<br />Doesn't get much better than this.

review/summary: the most drinkable green tea
review/text: I make  iced green tea because I find drinking water bearable rather than enjoyable. And green tea is healthier than other non-water beverages, but I don't love green tea, either. So I've tried various flavored green teas, and the fruit-flavored ones usually result in a sort of sicky-sweet fruitiness mixed with the dirt flavor of green tea. This one, however, is the most tolerably-flavored green tea I've found so far, almost enjoyable, even.

review/text: STASH brand teas are typically very expensive to buy here in the city. I'm so grateful to find a box of 100! Packaging is very no frills - a box with 100 tea bags, but they are individually sealed to stay fresh so it doesn't matter. Small box is conveni8ent to store at home, and 100 bags makes it a nice perk for the office.<br /><br />This tea is great with or without milk. It reminds of chai tea from an Indian restaurant. Very flavorful and full of cinnamon goodness with a hint of heat.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: Stash Peach Tea is the best peach tea that we've found. For some reason it is always hard to find in OKC, it sells out as soon as it appears on the local store shelves. We found the 100 count box on line and ordered it. The price was higher per bag than the 20 count boxes that we buy at the local stores, but the convenience of finding it was worth the additional money spent.

review/text: This tea has a great smooth flavor.  It has a subtle spearmint taste to it which i find to be relaxing after a long day.  My only complaint is that the tea did not come in a 100 count box, it was loose single serving packets thrown into the box that it was shipped in.  Not that big of a deal, but would have been a little nicer if it was in a 100 count box like in the picture.

review/summary: A deliciously potent peppermint tea!
review/text: This stuff is great.  The peppermint smell when you open up the teabags is incredibly strong -- much moreso than with a number of other peppermint tea brands that I've tried before.  Let me tell you, I am a mint addict, and this stuff really hits the spot.  For hot tea, I use one bag for every 8-12 oz. of hot water.  For iced tea, I use 2 bags for every quart, and it's great every time!  So, for 100 bags, I will probably get about 15-20 pitchers of tea (just depending on how much I make each time).  One thing that I wish the product description had let me know -- they literally send you a cardboard box with 100 loose (though individually wrapped) teabags inside.  The whole thing is a  little disorderly and presented a bit of a storage problem for us since the box is fairly large and the bags are not organized at all inside.  However, the tea is just so good that this one inconvenience is not enough to take the rating below 5 stars.

review/summary: Best decaf green tea. DELIGHTFUL FLAVOR & CONVENIENT
review/text: Stash tea continues to serve up the best tea products in bags.  This is especially true for their green tea.  It is pleasant, slightly "grain" flavored, lacks bitterness while having a delicate tea flavor and feel in the mouth. It is equally robust when used for iced tea.  I also like the 100 count box of loose envelopes without the cello zip strip bags of 25.  They are very fresh in their individual foil lined bags, convenient easy to open and use.  Overall a good value.  Will continue to buy this delightful tea

If you don't want to mess with brewing your own tea this is an acceptable substitute.  Makes a very good ice tea as well.

I love Earl Grey, and I have enjoyed many other Stash teas in the past (if you haven't tried the Chocolate Hazelnut yet, go order some now.  I'll wait...).  I tried this one, and it was like a ramped-up version of Earl Grey.  The bergamot oil is what makes Earl Grey, well, Earl Grey.  Doubling that oil just intensifies the flavor.  Great for a late weekend afternoon reading my Kindle.  I even keep a bunch in my office to get me through the last couple of hours!

I was so impressed with the robust flavors and aromas that I searched out their product line and bought several larger boxes (100 bags per box0.  While I have found limited selections in one supermarket, the online choices were far wider.  These are great teas.  Have fun brewing.

review/text: If you have never had a cuppa Earl Grey Tea with any meal or just to have a cuppa in the afternoon, you really don't know what you are missing. It is out of this world. It can relax you or make you feel like the day has just begun.<br />Order a box of Stash Premium Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea, Tea Bags from Amazon. And Google Bergamot, you will be surprised.

review/summary: Yum-o! 5+ cups of this tea a day!
review/text: I first fell in love with Stash's Wild Raspberry Herbal Tea on a recent trip to San Francisco. The little, european style hotel I stayed in offered this yummy tea 24-7 and I found myself stopping to grab a cup at least 3x a day. The tea has a strong, raspberry fruit flavor that is crisp enough to please your tongue and keep you hydrated, but without the keep-you-up-all-night caffeine. I instantly began craving the flavor.<br /><br />When I flew back to the east coast I was sad to realize that I couldn't find it in my local grocery store. I quickly hopped on Amazon and was happy to find that I can have the tea shipped to me. (YEA! Amazon!). Buying in the 100-count boxes is the cheapest option I've found, however, be warned that the 100-count box delivers the tea bags loose (they're in their separate, pink tea pouches, but loose in the box), which can be a cabinet disaster if you do not have a tea box or other place to keep the 100 tea bags under rule.<br /><br />The tea is great hot or cold over ice... you absolutely can't go wrong with this fruity tea!

review/summary: Really great tea!
review/text: I recently quit caffiene, and for over a year have quit sugar and all grains from my diet. This tea is my go to tea when I want something dessertish. A hot cup of this tea at night while watching TV is all I need to make me feel like I am having something to soothe me. I would give it 5 stars if it were organic. I try not to eat things with pesticides and fake flavors, but this tea is truly the most comforting delicious tea. I guess we can't be perfect 100% of the time. The fact that its decaf is awesome. Quitting caffiene has really helped with my ovarian cysts. They are much milder now than they have been in years. I even send in a zip lock bag to one of my son's teachers when I get it on auto delivery. This tea really takes me to my happy place at a great price.

review/summary: Not decaf, Error in Product Features description
review/text: Product Features copy says this is a decaffeinated version of the popular Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea.  This is the regular tea, not the decaf, it's a little paste-up error.  If you want the decaf version, get the other one, which also says it's the decaffeinated version.  If you look at the photo of the bags, you'll see the other version's photo shows the word "Decaf" or "Decaffeinated" ...

review/summary: What a Bargain
review/text: My local large chain grocery store wants $4.99 for a box of 20 of these great tasting Wild Raspberry, caffeine free, Herbal Tea Bags.  100 for $13.77 is a great bargain and with Amazon Prime shipping, what could be better?  Stash makes great products and I haven't found a one of their teas that I didn't like, but with this sort of savings, my local grocery store comes out the losers.  Getting the product delivered to my front door is yet another huge benefit, especially since I'm physically challenged.  Thank You Amazon and Stash!!<br /><br />I may be going out on a limb here, but Amazon Prime has two HUGE advantages for me.  Being physically challenged, I really do appreciate the reasonable 2nd Day Air shipping that you offer on many of the products purchased on this site...but the really BIG BONUS is that the $79 you charge for that 2nd Day Air shipping (delivered to my front door) also gives me unlimited streaming of thousands of movies that I can watch for NO ADDITIONAL COST.  Now in my book--that IS a BARGAIN!

review/summary: Great Berry Flavor
review/text: I have always loved Stash brand teas, and this is no exception. I tried Panera Bread's new Acai Berry Tea and LOVED it, so I did some shopping of my own in the hopes that I could find something with a comparable flavor. Well, this is IT! It has just the right amount of berry flavor-- very clean and just a bit tart. It was exactly what I was looking for. You cannot beat this value either. I purchased 18 of these exact tea bags for about $3 at Target, and was more than happy with the value. So to get more than four times that amount for less than four times the cost is awesome! I also love that these teabags are made in the USA. You will love this product!

review/text: This is wonderful tasting Raspberry tea.  I purchased a box of it along with several boxes of Blueberry - my favorite - not quite sure how I would like the raspberry.  It is so flavorful and just plain good.  I had been drinking Celestial raspberry tea, not thrilled with it, but this Stash raspberry knocks the other stuff out.<br /><br />I drink it iced.  The instructions seem to indicate that I should double the teabags, but I only use 2 herb tea bags and one green tea bag for 16 oz of tea and it is very flavorful.  Very flavorful.<br /><br />Good stuff.  I just received my first order today and it is so good that I had to reorder another box.

Then we pour it into a gallon jug, and add water to make one gallon of "iced" tea that we keep in the refrigerator.  On a weekend we can easily go through 3 or 4 gallons a day (we keep to jugs going.) I sweeten mine with what ever is handy, my husband drinks his straight.  We've used maple syrup and honey for sweeteners both are great!  I can also nuke a mug for hot tea.<br /><br />At work I keep this tea for my morning hot cup of tea.  I love that it if goes cold it's still delicious - no more wasted work coffee.  I've given tea bags to many at work, and converted most!<br /><br />We get this on auto refill and love love love it.  I've been drinking it for several years now.

review/text: The tea reminds me of a cross between apple chamomile and red zinger.  Tea arrived fast.  Paper wrapped bags, loose in a box.  I keep them in a pretty, large cookie jar at home and a stash at work for me and for bribes.  Tasty am or pm!

review/summary: Good, but stale
review/text: Each tea bag is wrapped in packaging. The bottom of each says "Best by 20102014". Huh? I think this tea is stale. The expiration date is confusing or just meaningless.<br />The tea bags are sent in a shipping box. So, you get 100 tea bags all wadded into a cardboard box with a shipping label stuck on the outside. You will need to put the bags into something else when you receive them. A ziplock bag should be fine.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I really enjoy this herbal tea.  At first I wasn't sure about it, but by the second cup it had really grown on me.  I can't have caffeine and this actually contains no tea at all, just herbs, so it's perfect. I love the spearmint flavor.  If you don't like spearmint, you will not like it!  As it is the most notable flavor in the tea itself.

review/summary: Delicious, and the packaging is fine.
review/text: The tea is delicious, and is truly double-spice. I usually steep my teas for an unreasonably long time to get a strong flavor, and with this one I don't have to. It's not quite as amazing as a fresh home-made chai, but it's the best I've had from a bag.<br /><br />A note on the packaging - as the Amazon picture would indicate, the tea is shipped in the Stash cardboard box, and the individual packets are packed within that box. They're not "crammed", they're packed tightly and don't suffer any damage that I've seen. Personally, I prefer this shipping method, as it cuts down on waste. I'll add an image to the product page to show how mine arrived.

review/summary: Coconut is more pronounced than mango.
review/text: One of the biggest challenge to mix more than one fruit flavor in tea is to be able to balance the taste and aroma of the two fruits, so the tea doesn't taste and smell like one or the other. I love real mango and coconut, so when I saw this tea displayed in the grocery store, I couldn't wait to try it. I must say I was a little disappointed because after brewing a cup, I immediately noticed only the aroma of the coconut, and the taste of the tea proved it that way as well. Though there are other brands that utilize Mango and do a better job in their flavored tea, I am still happy that I got to know this Stash tea as there aren't that many brands that use the coconut flavor in their tea.

review/summary: My second-favorite mint tea
review/text: I love most of stash's greens:  they tend to be green (think grassy-flavored, but in a good way), smooth, mild, flavorful, and so devoid of bitterness that they're almost sweet.  I haven't found a better go-to green than stash yet, though there are some other truly good ones out there.  Most of them steep very forgivingly if you steep your tea too short or too long, and this one is no exception.<br /><br />This was my favorite mint green in the world until I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4MV3E">Stash Premium Merrymint Organic Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a>, an organic mint and green blend that's also by Stash.  I've introduced coworkers to both and they loved this tea initially, but turn their noses up now that they've tasted Merry Mint.  If Merry Mint didn't have lemongrass in it, I'd be drinking it still!  If you don't have a grass allergy, please do try the other tea.  If you DO have a grass allergy, consider this one.  It really truly will be the best you've tasted as long as you keep yourself away from the other one.<br /><br />I sometimes brew peppermint and green tea together, but only when I'm out of these.  I order them by the hundred and STILL run out--they're good!<br /><br />A word on the 100-count boxes:  I've purchased about five of these in different flavors, and they pack these TIGHTLY.  I appreciate the green use of minimal materials, and no bag has ever been torn open, but they're often too wrinkled to redistribute as gifts or for resale.  Not always, but often.<br /><br />Edit:I neglected to mention that this also ices well. Many stash teas don't: they develop a film of flavor oil on the top. This one doesn't suffer from that as badly, but you can minimize that effect by putting your tea bags into cold or room-temperature water and allowing for a longer steep and a milder flavor. It actually makes excellent flavored water if you want something even more refreshing than tea.<br /><br />An update:  this has lemongrass in it, too!  Drat!  Both of my favorite mints will have to be a sometimes-tea, probably in winter when I'm not feeling stuffy!  When my allergies are acting up I'll have to revert to finding a lovely herbal mint tea to brew side-by-side with my favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4F1QS">Stash Premium Decaf Premium Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a>.

review/summary: He LOVED the tea!
review/text: My boyfriend likes Earl Grey tea, and had mentioned that he loves the Bergamot smell. One day he commented that he could barely smell the bergamot in most teas. I purchased this 100-count box of Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea as part of his birthday gift in October, 2011 after reading the reviews. At first, he thought the tea was the norm and that he would be drinking this tea for years. But, after that, he has commented repeatedly that "his tea" is better than any other because of the extra bergamot flavor/content. He is one happy boyfriend. Thanks.

review/text: I love this tea. I ordered some 100 ct boxes of different teas for our small resort. I don't like green or black tea, even if it's flavored. But a customer tried this flavor and it smelled SO good to me that I had to try one. Yum! I just added a spot of sugar and it was like a dessert to me. Finally an enjoyable way to get some green tea into me.

review/text: I read the other reviews stating how mild this was, but I was expecting it to have some vanilla flavor. While it smells really wonderful (creamy and slightly spicy), I can only taste rooibos and chamomile when I drink it.<br /><br />It's nice, but it's definitely not "cinnamon vanilla." Thankfully, I do like red tea very much on it's own.

It's also a good cold weather alternative for hot cocoa if you are trying to watch your weight. I like that there is no mint flavor with the chocolate--not easy to find. The tea doesn't get bitter or too strong if it brews a little too long and the black tea doesn't overwhelm the chocolate flavor. This was a great value for Stash tea on Amazon!

review/text: While a hundred bags of tea seemed overwhelming at first, given my two-cup-a-day consumption, it won't take me long to get through. I drink a cup after breakfast and another after dinner. It is a nice, rich blend of chocolate and hazelnut that is very satisfying. It certainly curbs my appetite. Without it I want to keep eating, with it I feel like my meal has been complete.
