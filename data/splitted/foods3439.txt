review/summary: Keeps me going
review/text: Just started grad school two months ago and I swear I've never drank so much red bull as I have these past two months. On top of school I have a 1.5 hr commute to and from school so this really helps keep me alert. Just make sure you accomplish what you really need to do when you first drink it. Sometimes I put my work off a little bit and find myself ready for a nap or an advil after the red bull has worn off.

review/summary: Thanks, Red Bull!
review/text: I first drank Red Bull when, after working all night, a young man advised it.  Seriously, at my age, I felt like passing out.  But I drank the Red Bull, and very shortly felt all right.  I checked, and if you aren't worried about drinking from a can, it has healthy ingredients.<br /><br />A year later I had extreme fatigue from a stroke brought on by high stress.  Red Bull has helped me function as I recouperate.  [BTW, severe fatigue after stroke is helped by raw adrenal tissue tablets.]

review/summary: Works For Me
review/text: The folks in Austria have come up with a fine product. I gulp down a can of this sugarfree Red Bull every morning about an hour before I make my daily walk. It has made the walks much easier to complete and also increases the walking speed which in turn burns more calories with which I am glad to part. I happened to be over at Sam's club a while ago and they carry this product for 33 bucks and some change so I picked up a case while there. I live about 10 miles from Sam's so with gas prices ever climbing plus the state sales tax it would not be worth a trip just for the Red Bull. For only a couple bucks more Amazon will deliver a case right to my front door. Kinda pricey but the benefits to me are worth the cost.

review/text: I Love this stuff. I grab it out of the fridge in the morning and it's an instant "wake me up"<br />It has a very unique taste, and not so syrupy sweet as most energy drinks. I will say however, If you have a costco membership these 24 ct cases are $33.00 a case. I wouldn't pay more than $1.50 per can for these when buying in bulk!

review/text: Ever since my first Red Bull I've been hooked.  I switched from regular to sugar-free to cut back on sugar and at first it was a bit nasty, but over time it started to taste good.  I drink Red Bull almost daily to get me going.  Some people say it doesn't work for them, but it does for me.  Red Bull gives you wings~

review/summary: Red Bull sugar free, the nectar of the gods!!
review/text: Red Bull sugar free is the best.  No crash from sugar and still the same amount of caffeine as regular.<br />I used to drink regular Red Bull but I found that my eyes would really hurt from all of the sugar and that there would be a pretty substantial crash a few hours after consumption.  I typically drank one a day.  I guess you can say that I may have a Red Bull addiction.<br />Since switching to Red Bull Sugar Free, there is no crash and none of that funky eye pain mid-day; and since it is sugar free it's got less calories.  That's my justification at least :)

review/summary: The best energy drink, but super overpriced.
review/text: I think that almost everyone would agree that Sugarfree Red Bull is, without considering price, the best diet energy drink there is.  The flavor is great.  A bar at my university had a $2 (sugarfree) Red Bull & Vodka special... probably the best drink special that exists anywhere.<br /><br />But price is a big consideration, and $2+ for an 8 ounce can is ridiculous.  For everyday waking up/making it through the day energy I've switched to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off Holiday Sale!</a>, as 30 cents per pill is much better for my budget.<br /><br />But if a can is free, or if there's a good special on it, I'll never pass up a sugar free redbull and vodka at a bar, my day has been made.  I just wish that Red Bull wasn't so expensive.

review/summary: No Bull: This stuff rocks
review/text: Ah Red Bull, equally fantastic as an energy drink or as a 'mixer' for 'adult beverages,' as my Grandmother used to call them. What can I say that you don't already know? Weather you're looking for an shot of energy or something tasty to blend with vodka and a fresh lime, Red Bull will not disappoint.<br /><br />I find that the low calorie version has about the same flavor as regular, but feels thinner in the mouth. I actually prefer the low cal stuff, and its a staple in my fridge.<br /><br />I should also mention that Red Bull can only truly be appreciated if you've had other 'lesser' energy drinks (rock star comes to mind). Red bull is superior in taste, consistency, and usually has fewer calories. I've tried a good number of energy drinks, and Red Bull is easily the best out there.

review/summary: The Most Popular Energy Drink in the Phillippines
review/text: Red bull energy drink is very popular in the Philippines. It is used by many workers to help fight daily stressors. As for my part, I use it whenever there are upcoming long examinations and oral recitations in our law classes. I need to stay awake for long hours in the evening just to read through long legal excerpts so I can have few wise statements to utter during oral recitations. I need enough energy to endure the brain torture I will experience while I take the two hour of mental battle I will enter into come final examination day.<br /><br />It is no doubt effective but the moment its energy boosting effect wears down; I have no choice but to sleep. Unfortunately when I sleep, it meant sleeping for more than eight hours which is not very healthy. I still prefer the use of my Gene Eden products as natural supplements. It offers long lasting energy which I definitely need since I am working law student. However, I only get it every time I receive packages from my aunt in the US since Gene Eden Vir 101 is still not shipped by Amazon here in the Philippines.<br /><br />Please ship them soon so I can have regular dose of this wonderful product. Thanks!

review/text: My husband drinks energy drinks nearly every day, so I'm always looking for a good deal.  These were on the Friday Sale, so I ordered a two-pack.  It's an ok deal, but if you watch sales, you can find them about the same price elsewhere.<br /><br />I do like having them shipped to me.  That's nice.  Packaging could be a little better, but that feedback was left in the appropriate place.  I just wish that it hadn't taken twice as long as any other product I have ordered with the Super Saver shipping.  I know that it came well within the aloted time, and I know that they said it takes a few extra days, but I'm spoiled with Amazon's amazingly fast shipping.  We had run out at home, and I was hoping to not have to make the shopping trip.<br /><br />In the end, my husband was quite happy to come home to a fresh 24 pack waiting for him on the doorstep.

review/summary: Great Product, Horrible Price
review/text: Sugarfree Red Bull is by far better than its sugar filled brother. With only 10 calories per can, it tastes lighter and crisper than that "other" Red Bull. It can't replace the morning coffee, but after a workout, it can make you feel significantly better until you can replenish with food.<br /><br />However, the prices on Amazon are NOT a good deal. The only way it is a good deal is if you simply can't find the product anywhere. You can regularly find a 12 pack at any Wal-Mart or grocery store for $20. If you really need 24, then go buy two 12 packs for just over $40. Why would anyone in their right mind pay $10 more? But gas you say? Please, if you spend $10 in gas to get to the store, then by all means buy your Red Bull here. Anyway, to reiterate, great product-horrible Amazon prices.

review/text: I am very particular about what I feed my 7 pound Maltese and generally don't give him commercially made food or treats after so many pet food scares.  However, these are made with "real" food, and I would feel safe eating them myself (although I don't!).  Charly likes them and I feel good giving them to him.  They're a bit bigger than I need for my little guy, so I break them up a bit.  They break easily enough that I can give him 1/4 to 1/2 at a time as a treat.

For some reason, he didn't want to eat it at all - probably it doesn't have a strong dog food/chicken smell?  But I'm sure they made it with good ingredients - I can see the oats in the biscuits.  I wish they could improve the flavor a bit to attract the dogs more - since I have seen other reviewer having similar comments.

review/summary: Veterinarian review
review/text: I received a free sample of the Liv-a-Littles Healthsome dog biscuits with real chicken. This small biscuit, which you can see visible rolled oats in, prides itself on being oven-baked, with high-quality natural ingredients. Unfortunately, JP - my 11 year old picky pit bull - took it from my hand like a kid forced to swallow an oatmeal vitamin coated with vegetables. He eventually ate it, but it lacked the palability to please my dog.<br /><br />The ingredients include (in order): whole wheat flour, chicken, potato flour, pea flour, chicken liver, rolled oats, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), pumpkin, tomatoes, apples, sweet potatoes, cranberries, split peas, carrots, green beans, green bell pepper, celery, parsley, and ascorbic acid (a preservative - Vitamin C). While it has all the healthy veggies in it that your mom would be proud of, it failed the Lee palatability test. One paw down for palatability. Of course, if you own a Labrador retriever who'll eat anything, he'll like them, but they didn't pass JP's palate.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy and good on just about EVERYTHING
review/text: This is the best salad dressing I have found. The reason I first purchased it is that it was free of the common allergens found in most salad dressings - soybean oil, sugar, corn syrup, and dairy. When I tasted it, I felt like I was eating something from a fancy restaurant - so flavorful. This dressing is just pure good, healthy stuff like olive and canola oil and vinegar, and the flavor is wonderful - tangy and smooth. I put it on salads, but also soup, meats, casseroles, breakfast, lunch, dinner. It's good on almost everything to add a burst of flavor. Sometimes I use it on taco dishes as a substitute for cheese and salsa - two foods I cannot have, but without which dishes can be bland. The dressing makes up for it. It does cost a little more than your average dressing, but it's worth it, I think.

review/text: I purchased the book "Artisian Breads in Five Minutes a Day" and used this flour as directed for the Semolina Bread.  Delicious, Easy and well worth the investment.  Get the book, you won't believe how easy it is to bake fresh breads, and this recipe should not be overlooked. Not just for pasta!  If you can find semolina flour in your supermarket, the Hodgson Mill brand is still the best!  The loaves were full of flavor and came out fluffier and more delicate.  Well worth the extra effort.

review/summary: Makes great pasta!
review/text: We had the dickens of a time trying to find Semolina pasta flour.  Grocery stores and gourmet stores around us just didn't carry it.  We finally found the flour at this web site for a reasonable price and got it just before the big snow storms.  Our first use of the Semolina flour for making pasta was a wonderful.  The pasta it produced was very tasty and definitely different in texture to other flour we had used.  I'd highly recommend it.

A 'Scoville Unit' is actually a measure of capsaicin (the chemical in hot peppers that is responsible for their heat).<br /><br />Scoville's test was a comparative taste test that is considered subjective by today's standards. A more sophisticated method is in use today, but in honor of Wilbur Scoville, the unit of measure is still called the Scoville.<br /><br />The capsaicin level in peppers can vary from plant to plant due to local environmental conditions. This means that a pepper's rating is an average measure.<br /><br />The hottest pepper on record is the Bhut Jolokia with a pungency of over 1 million Scoville Heat Units (1,001,304, to be exact). By contrast, the Bell Pepper comes in at less than 100 Scoville Heat Units."

review/summary: Epigen saved my cat's life
review/text: I have an adorable 6-year-old Exotic Shorthair cat. Within the past year he mysteriously developed all sorts of food sensitivities. If he would eat anything containing fish, dairy, glutens, corn, grains, starches, guar gum, xanthan gum, etc, he would have really nasty diarrhea, sometimes with a little blood in it, so i tried different foods for weeks and weeks, losing sleep trying to solve the problem. I was terrified for him so i got him tested for everything. The test results were inconclusive, so the vet said that he probably just had a sensitive digestive system...but when i put him on sensitive stomach foods from other companies, he still had the same problem, and those sensitive stomach foods all contain glutens, corn, etc, and most canned food contains guar gum, so the whole thing seemed hopeless. Plus, i was scared for my cat because chronic diarrhea leads to dehydration, malnutrition, anemia, etc, so my cat seemed doomed. Then during an internet search i found out about Dr. Wysong and his Epigen food. I tried the small bag first. Within 24 hours my cat's stool was 85% normal. And within  2 or 3 days it was totally normal as if he'd never had a problem. This pet food is amazing! It changed my cat's life! Epigen is made for both cats and dogs. I buy the chicken formula. I'm a customer for life and i pray that they never stop making this stuff!

review/summary: Outrageous Price Increase !!
review/text: Chicken of the Sea Whole Baby Clams are tender, mild in taste,<br />and grossly overpriced.<br /><br />Clams provide excellent nutrition and protein, however the current price is prohibitive.<br /><br />Clams are versatile and can be used in many recipes.<br /><br />However, I purchased this product prior to April 23, 2012 for<br />$28.86 with free shipping.<br /><br />The price increase of $16.13 since writing my review 2 days<br />ago is outrageous and unwarranted! And the shipping cost adds<br />"insult to injury."<br /><br />There is no shortage of clams available and I will look for another<br />product.<br /><br />Drained and rinsed, I love clams marinated in a bit of olive oil<br />with garlic and a generous dash of Cajun seasoning.<br /><br />Clams are rich in Iron for those of us suffering from an Iron deficiency.<br /><br />Clams are a good source of Omega-3 fatty acids and are very low in Saturated Fat. Clams provide Magnesium, Manganese, Vitamin B12, Riboflavin, Niacin, Phosphorus, Potassium, Copper, Zinc, and Selenium.<br /><br />Clams are a very good source of Protein.<br /><br />Please be aware that data suggests that the calcium in milk, cream, etc. can inhibit iron absorption.

review/summary: Where's the TEA?
review/text: NO TEA!  They took the tea OUT of the bags!  This was my absolute favorite tea: I drank it every day and kept it on auto-order.  Then suddenly one month I couldn't believe it: instead of lovely tea bags that justified their high price, they sent these pitiful bags with only a little hint of tea -- not enough to make even a single decent cup.  You can tell the old bags from the new by the wrappers: the good old ones were printed to match the box design, the bad new ones are just anonymous solid green.  I would never order it again.  They should charge a reduced price that's proportionate to the radical reduction in tea.  A complete rip-off.  Do not waste your money.

review/text: Great taste, and also great value ordering here on Amazon. I usually brew with loose tea, but these teabags are a very close 2nd place to brewing loose tea, especially when out of the house. I usually bring these teabags with me when eating out and get a cup of hot water to make my own tea instead of the restaurant variety tea bag.

review/text: Boursin - Garlic and Fine Herbs - great taste our favorite spread with fine crackers. We have been served this in high end hotels several times and wanted to have some at home too. The only "watch out" is our order was almost out-of-date when we received it. We still enjoyed it, BUT...had to eat it fast. IF the out-of-date was reasonable this item would have received 5 stars!

review/summary: A New Must Have Item
review/text: This crumbly, white cheese is a delicious combo of feta-like texture, slight cream cheese tone. It is a sensory delighting garlic and herb experience that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />It comes in a pleasant, white box that looks slightly more like a garlic supplement than a package for cheese. As shown in the picture, it does come wrapped in a silver foil packet with ridges. Like a foil wrapped, crumbly cheese cupcake.<br /><br />My "best before" date was Feb 19, 2010 but was literally gone in within less than a day. I had originally purchased it on a whim but both my 66 year-old mother and 7 year-old son fully support my decision to add Boursin's Garlic & Fine Herbs Gournay [not misspelled; it's their word] Cheese to our "must have" list.<br /><br />The Boursin website has a feature that allows you to search for local vendors but, for some areas, it is no where near accurate. Unless you know where to buy it already, I would recommend purchasing this very palatable cheese online.

review/summary: Suspicious taste
review/text: I have tried dozens of these packets of snacks over the past 3 years.  Various flavors from various lots.  Some of them a while back tasted fine.  Lately, all I get are ones with a bitter, rancid taste.  Especially on the Friends variety.  Does "all natural" mean "High in THC"?<br />What is up with that sharp nasty taste?  These things aren't expired.  I've communicated with Annie's on numerous occasions and have always recieved coupons for more, but I've given up on ever finding another lot of this product that doesn't taste gross.  My kids won't even eat them anymore.  Its like they are all rancid or something.

review/summary: Teddy Graham's Competition
review/text: I wanted to try these as a slightly healthier alternative to Teddy Grahams.  These are organic and have a few less ingredients.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />With three flavors of "bunnies" you get a medley that is kind of nice.  However, only the chocolate ones have enough flavor to even compare to a Teddy Graham.  The chocolate chip has a very, very mild chocolate flavor, but isn't too bad.  The honey flavor is pretty bland.  Honey Teddy Grahams have more flavor, so I'd choose them over plain honey bunnies.<br /><br />TEXTURE:<br />These bunnies get stale very fast.  Seal them up well, or you'll have bad tasting bunnies.  Fresh, they're crispy and crunchy and a great size for on-the-go snacking or sitting at your computer with a cup of coffee and these little cookies.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION<br />I do like the organic factor.  However, they're generally a little more money than their competing Teddies, and I like Teddy flavor better.  It's up to you and your taste buds, but I would at least recommend trying the bunnies.  I buy them when they're on sale for cheaper than Teddies.

review/summary: Not just for kids......these are tasty!
review/text: Ok, I have to say, the packaging did draw me in... I mean, how could the little hippy bunny flashing you a peace sign steer you wrong?  So I picked up the box...organic, I like that, 8 grams of sugar, I can live with that, no trans or saturated fats, 20% calcium, 2 grams of fiber, and I can have 28 little cookies (a combo of chocolate, honey & chocolate chip) for 130 calories.  So, the bunnies and I went home together....<br /><br />These are my favorite little cookies when I want something sweet but don't want to obliterate all the good eating that I did all day.  Yeah, they are a cookie, but I felt good that I could eat organic and that there were no additives or preservatives.  I like to keep mine in the fridge where they stay nice and cold and crunchy and just wait for me to pair it with a glass of milk.<br /><br />Great snack for the little ones as well as those of us who are young at heart!

These go for $2.99 at Earth Fare, so they're not that expensive, especially for how much is in the box!  I know 7.5 ounces doesn't sound like that much, but I emptied the entire box into a ziploc bag, and I've been snacking on them for the past 3 days and I still haven't made a dent!  Although, I don't have kids and I won't share with my husband, so that could be why :-)  Seriously, give these a try - you will NOT be disappointed.

review/text: In my ongoing effort to provide healthy snacks to the children in my son's class (he goes to a public elementary school), I try various organic finger foods. One of the things that has boggled my mind is the amount of graham crackers that contain trans fat- and they are marketed as healthy! When I saw these, I was pleasantly surprised- I didn't imagine I'd see an organic AND trans fat free graham cracker product.<br /><br />Not only are these free of trans fats AND high fructose corn syrup (which is typical of organic products, thankfully) but they are absolutely delicious. I love snacking on them and the kids in my son's class loved them! I went ahead and used the subscribe-and-save feature for this product and now his class has a steady supply of healthy and yummy snacks. :)

review/summary: Mylar balloon flavored graham crackers.
review/text: I am a fan of this brand, but was extremely disappointed when I tried the Bunny Graham Friends. I noticed immediately upon opening the brand new box that there was a strange odor. I proceeded to open the metallic bag, and almost instantly correlated the smell with that of a mylar balloon (those metallic helium balloons). Sadly, the graham snacks were impregnated with the smell and taste as well. I'm all for "green" packaging and such, and realize the hidden dangers of plastic packaging, but surely there is another way to package these without ruining the flavor or earth. I will, however, continue to buy the macaroni and other products from this line, but I will never waste my money on this item again.

Now that I live in SC, I miss it terribly.<br /><br />Occasionally work will take me to NJ and I'll buy however many I can fit in my suitcase.  Before leaving town, I'll put them in the office freezer overnight so they're good for transport the next day when I head to the airport.  I've made friends with many of the TSA guys in various airports just by saying "I've got Taylor Pork Roll in my suitcase."  They "get it" and laugh.  One even remarked that "[you'd] be surprised how many of those things come through here!"<br /><br />If you're looking for a better price on mail order TPR, just go here ...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Tasty with Benefits
review/text: I've finished my first box of Ganocafe Mocha. It was delicious. Initially, since I had expected a different taste, I found it to be surprising. The blend of milk powders and sugars are just right. It's a smooth taste with the extra melding of the Reishi that enhances the flavor. I can't describe it. It was different enough to notice and pleasant enough to make me wish I had ordered another box before the first ran out. I've also purchased and experienced the taste of the Ganocafe Coffee, without the milk and sugar additives. You can make what you want of it. It has that specific flavor that makes it a special cup of coffee. About the benefits, Reishi is a known adaptogen herb that helps to bring balance to body functions. Reishi's balancing qualities offer support for both the body's immune and nervous systems. Herbalists use Reishi to support allergies, bronchitis, viral infections and hypertension, Its adaptogenic effect also extends to detoxification, mood and appetite, vigor, and mental alertness. There are no side effects-- it's all beneficial. I highly recommend the Ganocafe experience. Its one I think you'll enjoy and make a habit. BTW, there is no caffiene- something I thought I'd miss. I didn't. I guess the taste and results of the Reishi made up for it. Again, it's absolutely DELICIOUS, and given the costs of special coffees, it's one you can enjoy at home at an affordable price.

I've tried other brands of mocha with the ganoderma (Reishi) mushroom, but Gano-cafe (by Gano Excel) has absolutely the best taste, and mixes the smoothest. The other brands had a tendency to be grainy and/or not mix well and settle at the bottom of the cup too much. The best "healthy" things I like about Gano-cafe Mocha is, of course, the benefits of the mushroom, but also the low caffiene level,which protects me from the acidity of normal coffees. It is less expensive than coffee-house drinks, and healthier, with less sugar and no chemical additives/preservatives. I, personally, use about half a package to 6 oz. of water, to tailor to my personal taste preference. Gano-cafe Mocha is my indulgence! Especially in cool/cold weather it is a tasty and comforting drink! I usually have at least 2 cups a day!

review/text: I was looking into ReishiMushroom and came across this brand of coffee that already has it mixed in!<br /><br />First of all I'm not much of a Coffee drinker... which is why I bought both the Ganocafe Classic and the Ganocafe Mocha to see if either one was right for me... tried the Classic and didn't like that one too much but the Mocha that on the other hand tasted Great! The drink gave me a natural high feeling which was very pleasant, I guess that's the effect from the Reishi =)<br /><br />The price does seem a bit high for only 15packets... but in a way it is cheaper than going to Starbucks.

review/summary: an excellent and fragrant rice
review/text: I eat a lot of rice, so I am always buying different kinds to try out. Most frequently, I eat sushi rice seasoned with only salt and sesame seeds.  This rice is my favorite so far!  Just the fragrance of this rice cooking in the rice cooker will get people to ask where the wonderful smell is coming from. The taste is just as nice, clean, and with flavorful toasty notes.  This rice is also almost as nutritious as brown rice, just without as much fiber. the germ is intact, so you need to wash it gently in order to keep the germ intact on the grain. This is what gives this rice the beautiful aroma, taste and nutrition.<br /><br />This rice cooks best if you follow the washing and soaking directions on the package. Just 30 minutes of soaking and this rice will yield the same texture as polished white sushi rice. I have found that all sushi rice works best when cooked in a rice cooker, so I can't say how this rice would fare if cooked in a pot with a tight fitting lid. The texture maybe slightly more firm if done in a pot, so you may want to increase soaking time OR add a few extra tablespoons of water at the start of cooking.<br /><br />This rice would make an excellent breakfast rice with an egg and kurobata sausage, or any grilled fish. Nice and sticky enough for any kind of sushi as well.
