review/summary: Absolutely delicious and addicting!
review/text: These small crackers are baked so they are not greasy or have a processed flavor you may find in other brand cheese crackers. They are crisp, not overly salted, and taste delicious. I do like the fact that they are tiny, but be forewarned, they could be a choking hazard for very small children as eating one at a time is almost impossible because the crackers are very tiny.

review/text: I expected the fish to be swimming around in water when they arrived at my doorstep.  Instead, they were in a box!  Oh the humanity!  I put them into my fish tank, hoping they needed some water but they still didn't swim.  They just needed some water!  I am still trying to get them to breathe.  I am reading my Bible and praying religiously hoping they will rise from the dead.  Who would do such a thing?  Satan is at work here.  These fish were so cute and innocent!  They were probably used in shampoo-testing, I suspect because of the orange crumbs at the bottom of the box.

review/summary: Tasty Product, Good Quantity; Dented Cans
review/text: The Healthy Choice Chicken & Dumplings Soup was very tasty and more hearty than I expected.  There is more broth in this product than in Healthy Choice's beef soup and chicken and rice, but still satisfying.<br />**Do be careful if you are on a low-sodium diet, as it is difficult to dillute this product to reduce the sodium any further.  But it still has far less sodium than in regular soups.<br /><br />TIP: Healthy Choice Soups are good for enhancing larger pots of soup when added to your own fresh ingredients.  A meal stretcher in the winter months.<br /><br />Several of the cans were dented upon arrival.  When I ordered soup from Walgreen's, their cans were tightly wrapped in bubble-wrap and had no dents.<br /><br />I ordered the case from Amazon during the snow storm we had back in February because the grocery stores were running low on food.  Though I requested a faster shipping rather than accept the Free Shipping offer, the product was delayed because the U.. driver did not want to drive in the snow. (Ironically, the snow was beginning to clear and Amazon's tracking system said that the item was in my neighborhood.  However, when the U-- driver heard that it MIGHT begin snowing again, he reversed himself and took the package back to his facility.  A different U-- driver had delivered packages earlier that day without any problems.  Oh well.)

review/text: I'm a big fan of having Amazon deliver me boxes of soup cans.  This is the third time I've ordered Healthy Choice soup, and the running issue is that some of the cans are always dented.  A couple severely, to the point where I am not comfortable eating them (the treated lining inside can get torn if the can is dented enough, and you're not supposed to eat it.)<br /><br />Aside from the denting, I'm a fan.  Like I said.  Chicken and dumplings are my favorite, my only overarching complaint being that the stuff sputters and pops in the microwave and makes a huge mess.  Aggravating.  I also had a one off issue with one can leaving a horrible taste in my mouth that I couldn't shake off all day.<br /><br />But again, almost all good.

I loved it, and even signed up for subscribe and save.  I had never heard of Yogi Teas before, so I searched to see what other flavors were available.  This Peppermint Tea is wonderful!  It is quite strong, and has a flavorful aroma.  Plus, to my surprise, it does help with upset stomachs.  If you like mint tea, you cannot go wrong with this one! Sadly, these teas are not available in any of my grocery stores.  I found them through vitamin stores online, which turned out to be great because they were discounted and I could try one of each flavor I was interested in.<br /><br />I also enjoyed other flavors, such as Egyptian Licorice and Chai Roobios.  But, the Peppermint and Revitalizing Mint remain my favorites. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Pork Chomps Stripz  =  Dog's Favorite
review/text: The natural, white color, baked pork stripz are definitely our dog's all-time favorite chewy bone, and treat. Less often, the peanut butter or bacon flavor, because some of the flavor coating may flake off on the carpet, but did not leave a stain.  The flavored pork stripz are also very well liked.  (We stopped buying beef rawhides, totally.)<br /><br />After repeated flavor tests, laying a variety of rawhides out for our dog, only the pork is selected and picked up to chew.  The pork flavor and aroma is different than beef, and I believe a better product for our pet's digestion.  Our dog wants one or two after breakfast, after dinner, in between, and bedtime too.  So their slogan: pork "preferred 9 to 1" by dogs over beef, is true.  Our dog really loves, and prefers the pork chomps!<br /><br />The narrower, elongated shaped stripz are easier to chew, and swallow than the square pork chips.  Probably easier to digest too, because they appear a bit thinner.  The alternative is the Square shaped pork chips.  But, often the square chips have a couple in the bag, that are too thick and hard to chew, and are discarded as waste.<br /><br />The price of Pork Chomps on Amazon.com is nearly half-off compared to the local Petsmart store.  Besides, the store is usually sold out of the pork chomps, but it has rows and rows of beef rawhides (that people are not buying.) Stores, like Fred Meyers or Petco, have not yet started stocking pork chomps.  So, finding these on Amazon, I can really stock up, and get almost two to one, for value, versus driving to the store.  Happy dog, happy me!

review/text: I have a wolfdog that is very picky about her dental chews and I have been searching everywhere for a dental chew that didn't cost an arm and a leg but that she would still like. Saw these at Winco Foods in Northern California in the bulk bin, brought a couple home, and she LOVED THEM! They aren't hard and brittle like the greenies bones that she would just break up and swallow, but they aren't too soft either. They're great for her teeth, and though they aren't hard or soft, they take a little chewing and don't just break up, which means more teeth cleaning time. For dental chews, these are excellently priced and every dog I've shared my wolfdog's chews with have loved them too! They are also very nicely sized, not huge, but not too small either, just above a medium, so they're perfect for her.

I've tried the shephard on multiple dog toys, chews, etc.  And she won't eat them.  I bought some dental chews from Costco after I discovered she liked these Dr. Dental thinking one dental chew tastes like another to a dog. But not to her. I had to return them as she took it in her mouth, dropped it on the floor, then laid on it!<br /><br />But she loves these chews!  She waits patiently each morning but keeps her eyes on me to make sure I don't forget her chew before I leave for work.  As soon as I give it too her, she takes it and runs to her bed to chew it up.  Finally I have some thing she will chew on!  I buy these from Winco in Southern California.

review/summary: Wonderful Tea - hot or iced
review/text: I am not normally a fan of mint teas.  They usually smell great, but are very weak tasting, no matter how much you steep.  This is the first mint tea I have ever come across that has a black and green tea base, instead of just a green tea base.  What a difference!  The Assam really kicks the tea up a notch without overpowering the mint at all.  It has a lovely aroma, and a nice strong flavor.  I can't say whether I felt "revitalized" or "invigorated" but it tasted great and that's the most important thing.  It has such a great flavor, I tried it as an iced tea and found it was fantastic.  Very refreshing!<br /><br />Since this is marketed as "health tea," I have not been able to find any Yogi flavors in a regular grocery store.  It is available in vitamin shops (online and brick and mortar), and similar outlets.  Though it is a trifle expensive compared to regular tea at almost $4, I would definitely buy it again.  Since it takes several bags to make a pitcher of iced tea, it is worth it to subscribe for me, which also brings the price down.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />I also enjoyed the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMIYZY">Yogi Purely Peppermint, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, which is great for upset stomachs.

review/text: Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea is a minty and slightly spicy tea that includes green tea, black tea, organic peppermint, kola nut, guarana seed, ginger, and cinnamon. This tea is formulated, according to the manufacturer, to get your chi moving; that is, to improve your overall energy and well- being.<br /><br />First, let's talk about the taste. This mint tea is minty more than anything and a few minutes of steeping is more than enough to bring out the full, mint flavor. The mixture of green and black teas is evident, too, although not as obvious as the flavor of mint. And, if you search, you can detect the added spices. The cinnamon flavor is certainly there, but I admit that I had a hard time finding the other flavors, like the ginger.<br /><br />As for energy, well, I agree that I feel more energized after drinking two cups of this tea, but I can't say the credit goes to the basic ingredients. A more likely culprit is the caffeine, which is higher in this tea than in other teas.<br /><br />I love a good cup of tea and Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize is certainly a tasty tea with plenty of fresh mint taste. It might be a bit much for those who prefer to taste tea rather than mint, but I enjoyed it very much and recommend it to those who love the refreshing and uplifting combination of green and black tea with peppermint and other spices.

review/summary: Just from the description on the box...
review/text: ...you have to be somewhat worried that this tea will have a medicinal taste or funky aftertaste.  Instead the taste is mellow and the bite of the mint comes in the aftertaste, for a more than satisfying cuppa.  I'm agnostic on the revitalizing effects, but thumbs up as far as relaxation.

review/summary: light, clean flavored tea blend
review/text: Yogi Refreshing Mint ReVitalize tea is a combination of organic Assam (black) and peppermint teas with green tea extract.  A blend of organic spearmint, cinnamon bark, ginger root, cardamon seed, black pepper, and clove buds as well as stevia leaves, kola nuts, and guarana seeds are added to the mix.  Each tea bag contains about 77 mg of caffeine, which is slightly less than a cup of coffee.<br /><br />A good Assam tea is expected to be refreshingly rich, with a strong pleasant aroma, and a full bodied usually malty taste.  It contains caffeine and is often used as a breakfast or afternoon tea.<br /><br />A good peppermint tea has a light, clean, minty aroma and usually has a cleansing feel as it slips down the throat.  It is often preferred as a bedtime tea because it is caffeine free.  Peppermint tea has long been touted both for its calming qualities and as a digestive aid.<br /><br />The combination of Assam and peppermint in this particular Yogi tea results in a full-bodied mint flavored tea that is a pleasure to drink.<br /><br />The Yogi blend is presented as a 'Refreshing Mint' that 'naturally boosts energy and neutralizes impurities.'  I can only confirm that the combination of the caffeine from the Assam and the refreshing mint do provide a pleasant afternoon lift.

review/summary: Absolutely Awesome Mint Tea
review/text: Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea - I love it so much, I cannot tell you how much I love it!!!  This refreshing, minty, delicious tea is awesome.  It hits the spot.  It goes well with lots of foods, as well as by itself.  It is strong and minty - just perfect.<br /><br />I put a teabag or two in a glass of water.  The tea is strong, so before the drink is finished, I have to add more water.  It is perfect and delicious.  I don't usually put sugar in my tea, but for those people who do, sugar would be nice.  I usually just drink my tea straight.  I love tea with most all of my foods.<br /><br />Cornbread and ice tea is my favorite combination - even this minty tea goes good with cornbread.  In fact, it goes good with almost any food.<br /><br />Just a glass of tea, or a glass of tea with a brownie or cookie also is a wonderful combination.  This minty tea goes with almost everything, from cornbread to brownies.<br /><br />I am not usually a hot tea drinker.  I usually drink mine cold or iced.  But I know lots of people drink their tea hot.  This minty tea would be really awesome if it were hot.  Hot, minty tea sounds perfect and soothing and warm and even healing.<br /><br />I am so grateful that I got to find out about this tea.  I love it so much, and now you can bet it will be a regular in my kitchen cupboards.  Now that I know about it, there is no separating me from it.

review/text: I am a huge fan of this mint tea. I like the combination of peppermint and spearmint and the little bit of black pepper gives it a great kick. I use the bag for my first cup of tea and then re-use it with a green tea bag for my second cup of tea, to jazz up my green tea just a touch. It's refreshing over ice on a hot day. And a little Yogi tea wisdom on the tag is just a perk. There's nothing bad to say about this tea. Just love it!

review/summary: A delicious blend of fire and ice
review/text: Yogi ReVitalize tea is a unique blend of black tea, green tea extract, chai spices, and peppermint.  The result is a cool, refreshing tea with a warming after effect from the chai spices.  This tea contains caffeine, yet it is curiously relaxing when you need to unwind after a long day.  With the black tea you'd expect a bit of a bitter undertone, but the stevia leaf and peppermint keep any type of bitterness away.<br /><br />I love the fact that this tea blend is so unique and tasty, yet it's organic so I feel comfortable drinking it and serving it to my friends.  There is a downside...this is so good it's addictive.  Everyone who's tried it wants more, and it's not available in our local stores!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a refreshing boost with great flavor.

review/summary: Another Take on Mint
review/text: You might think I wasn't too thrilled when you see three out of five possible stars. This is, however, a truly delightful mint tea. There are so many varieties of mint tea out there that this didn't seem to me a groundbreaking new tea release. The idea of a revitalizing mint tea is rather original. If that is what you are looking for you can knock this rating a star or two higher. Of course, in my personal opinion, mint is a tea for relaxing rather than revitalizing. That is my opinion. I do enjoy the taste of this tea which isn't completely a pure mint flavor but rather a "minty" flavor.  If you like mint tea you will enjoy this tea as well. Yogi's quality is well known. If you are looking to revitalize, so much the better. This guy is looking to relax. It's just a personal preference... truly.

review/summary: Robust European Style Tea
review/text: We drink several of the Yogi Brand teas.  This is definitely a unique<br />blend of tea that most people will either realy like or not like at all.<br />It is a black tea blend with energizing herbs of peppermint,<br />ginger root, spearmint, cinnamon bark, stevia leaf for sweetness, kola<br />nut, clove bud, black pepper, Guarana Seed, Cardamon seed, and Green<br />tea leaf extract.  Most of these ingredients are organic.  It has a<br />bold robust flavor, European in style.  The black pepper felt a little<br />warm in my stomach the first time I drank it.  By the third tea bag, I did not<br />notice the warm feeling anymore in my stomach and the flavor just keeps getting better.<br />For tea enthusiasts, this tea is worth giving a try.

review/text: Ever had Bigelow's peppermint tea? The flavor really beats you over the head. That's why we tend to stay away from such teas in my household (the reason I would drink them is because they were decaf...I'm rather sensitive to caffeine).<br /><br />Yogi's mint tea does not beat you over the head. It doesn't pound your tongue with mint flavor. It's like a gentle massage, giving you the slightest hint/trace of mint.<br /><br />The only problem: it has caffeine. Oh well, can't win them all.

review/text: I received this from Vine then put it away in my cupboards, forgetting about it until I got sick this week with a cold. There is nothing more soothing to me than some mint tea with honey when I'm not feeling well.<br /><br />The aroma is wonderful. My husband, who pretty much only drinks green and jasmine tea, commented on how good it smelled. And while I don't know if it actually "revitalized" me, since I wasn't feeling well, I like the idea that it might. I also like that it has a black tea base, most mint teas are caffeine free and I do like a jolt of caffeine with my tea.<br /><br />It's a good tea with a great taste and aroma and something I will buy once this runs out.

review/summary: "Black Tea with Energizing Herbs"
review/text: Yogi tea hit it right with this combination--nice and minty with light undertones of herbs such as cardamon, cinnamon and clove, among others. It is slightly sweet, probably owing to the addition of Stevia Leaf. Besides mint, the basis of this blend is black tea, but it tastes much better than black tea to me.  I am not a black tea or energy drink consumer, so the 77 mg of caffeine is a bit high for me, but I do not feel jittery drinking this tea. This "ReVitalize" tea gives me a refreshing boost, and it seems like a good start to the morning.

review/summary: Another Great Flavor From Organic YOGI TEA Brands!
review/text: Yogi Tea brands story began in 1969 when Yogi Bhajan started teaching yoga in America. He shared the wisdom and knowledge of Ayurveda and healthy living that he had mastered in India with his students while serving a specially spiced tea, which they affectionately named "Yogi Tea." The recipe contained five traditional Ayurvedic spices: cardamom seed, cinnamon bark, clove bud, ginger root and black pepper. When blended and brewed, these delicious spices leave you feeling vibrant and alive, while boosting overall well-being. Intrigued by the complex flavor and inherent health benefits of this unique combination of spices, it wasn't long before several of the yogi's students were inspired to brew their own "Yogi Tea."<br />In 1984 this grassroots endeavor blossomed into the Yogi Tea Company. Packages of the rough, dried spices began to appear in natural foods stores throughout Southern California. As demand increased, the spices were more finely ground, packaged and sealed into individual tea bags. By 1986, Yogi Tea was distributed nationwide in three flavors.<br />Yogi has continued to expand and evolve our tea offerings to address specific health needs by creating specialized herbal formulas, blended for both flavor and purpose. Today, Yogi has nearly 60 tea blends, many of which are created using the five original Yogi spices.<br /><br />The refreshing Mint ReVitalize that I am reviewing today is one of the teas that has the 5 original spices plus peppermint and spearmint leaf, kola nut, guarana seed and stevia leaf.<br /><br />The addition of stevia leaf is great in this tea blend because you don't really need to add any other sweetener to this tea.  It is great as is.<br /><br />Each tea bag is packaged individually and is certified organic.  I have tried MANY flavors of Yogi Tea and it has become one of my favorite flavored tea brands.<br /><br />Have a "cuppa"...

review/text: This tea is your standard good-quality mint/black tea. It give you a nice energy lift and tastes good. It's not particularly standout in any way, but it's exactly what you'd expect. The mint teas I've had in the past have been herbal teas, so they were way  mintier, but obviously without the caffeine kick of the black tea. I think this is an excellent compromise & will probably be my mint tea of choice going forward.

review/summary: Refreshing flavor will unstick your chi
review/text: Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea has effects summed up by the name:  it is refreshing, minty, and it will revitalize you.<br /><br />Produced by the Yogi tea company, this tea is a black tea that includes green tea extract.  It includes peppermint leaf which gives it its refreshing minty taste.  It also includes a long list of herbal additives, which could actually do something for you, or could be a bit of a marketing tactic.  There were 2 that stood out for me:  guarana and kola nut.  Guarana provides guaranine, which is similar to caffeine.  Kola nut is another source of caffeine.  The 77mg of caffeine in each cup of tea does not include the stimulant effect provided by guarana and kola nut.  If you are hoping for a stimulant effect less than coffee, beware.  A cup of this tea actually contains more stimulants than a typical cup of coffee.  That said, its worth noting that the jitters that typically accompany a cup of coffee are absent here.  It has a nice "sharpening" effect without the upset stomach and jitters that a good cup of coffee can produce.<br /><br />The tea comes in a nice cardboard recyclable box, with some yoga breathing exercises designed to wake you up on the side.  Each tea bag includes some yogi advice, sort of like a fortune cookie.  When the box is first opened, the smell is reminiscent of weak chewing gum, but don't let that put you off: each cup of tea is boldly minty and refreshing.  The taste is every bit as delicious as other mint teas on the market.<br />Whether the mid-afternoon blahs are caused by your chi being stuck, or by a post-prandial insulin surge, a cup of this tea will definitely get you going.  It is refreshing and delicious, does not require a sweetener (contains a tiny amount of stevia already) and will give you a lift.<br /><br />Just don't drink it too late in the afternoon or you might be scrubbing floors at midnight.

review/summary: Tasty mint tea
review/text: I have purchased a few other Yogi brand teas, and so far I like them all.  (I have Mayan Cocoa Spice - awesome, vanilla hazelnut - pretty good, and Mexican Sweet Chili - odd but tasty).  I'm not the world's biggest fan of mint, but this is pretty good nonetheless.  It's not super strong mint, but it's more than just an aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm not sure how revitalized I was after drinking it.  I brought it to work to drink around 2:00 when I usually want to take a nap or at least go home, and while I still wanted to go home, I didn't feel like napping was imminent.  That said, I wasn't up to dancing in the aisles either.  I probably perked up a little.<br /><br />This is not my favorite tea, but it's a good mint tea.  I suspect it would be good iced, but I haven't tried that yet - still a bit chilly out.  If you want 6 boxes of tea, Amazon's price is exceptional.  And organic means that less poisons were dumped into the environment to make it, so that's always a good thing.

review/summary: A delicious little kick...
review/text: I'm a big tea drinker and am quite fond of Yogi teas for their taste and quality.<br /><br />This tea is no exception.<br /><br />I was a tad wary that having black tea mix with mint might result in minty bitterness, but that wasn't the case at all. The box recommends steeping for 4 minutes, but I chose 2 to be on the safe side.  I could have easily gone with 4, though as the tea had no hint of bitterness.<br /><br />I found it to be refrshing and just the right amount of pick me up for the evening. I drink decaf everything about 90% of the time so the low caffeine amount in this tea did affect me. I may have actually drank it too close to bedtime though as I did get that whooshing in the ears sound that normally only happens after caffeine for me.<br /><br />All told, I definitley enjoy this tea, but will likely keep it to mornigpng or early afternoon use.

review/text: I have no idea whether this tea actually "detoxes" my system, nor can I tell if any extra energy I feel after drinking it is due to the caffeine or the other ingredients. It is, however, a lovely, delicious tea that's become a highlight of my day. When hot, it's perfect for a frosty winter day (and goodness knows we've had a lot of those this year!), but it also makes a wonderful iced tea that I'm looking forward to enjoying this summer.<br /><br />I'd never have thought to put black pepper in a tea, but its combination with mint really gives a nice 'zing' that's made even better with a bit of honey, agave nectar or Stevia. That said, my husband didn't like the combination nearly as much and pronounced it "too minty", whereas I found after a couple of sips that the ginger and kola nut tastes were more pronounced.<br /><br />At any rate, it's a great tea that's just different enough to merit its own place in your tea box.

review/text: There is no way, of course, for a consumer to rate the claims Yogi makes of detoxification, of how one would know if her "chi" is stuck.  But the mint does make this tea refreshing.  A user should also note that it could be the caffeine, since the packaging acknowledges that this tea has almost as much caffeine as a cup of coffee, While the box suggests drinking "cup after cup" to enhance performance, your sensitivity to caffeine should be taken into account.

review/text: Am I the only one who loves a strong, mint tea?  With the name Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea, I expect more zing. Anyway, the taste  of this black tea after it steeps for quite awhile is really wonderful, almost spicy.  I drink iced tea, sometimes with Stevia, sometimes not.<br /><br />For anyone getting off soda, this is great.  I leave  the bags in with the ice while I sip for hours out of my large "sippy" tumbler.  I just boil water and put 2-3 cups water to heat until hot.  I put 3 tea bags and steep, then pour over ice.  The "pot" of tea lasts me all day.<br /><br />Enjoy your organic caffeine tea!

review/text: I love anything mint, so I've found the combination of black tea, peppermint and spearmint to be delicious. The addition of cardamom and ginger add an interesting flavor. The stevia adds just a light touch of sweetness. There's 77mg of caffeine in this tea, which is a little more than the average cup of black tea and a little less than a cup of coffee. I feel it helps with my energy level without the jittery feeling I get from coffee or caffeinated energy drinks. I often drink herbal mint teas, but when I want the energy boost of a black tea, this refreshing and minty tea is perfect.

review/summary: Smooth, Very Palatable Caffienated Tea
review/text: While I prefer coffee's flavor and body when I reach for a caffienated beverage in the morning, my afternoons often leave me slumpy. I've enjoyed herbal teas and suppliments as healthy alternatives since I was a toddler so I'm pretty open to trying something different when I have a problem like the caffiene shakes.<br /><br />I want to preface this review a little by saying I am a mint fanatic. It is one of my favorite flavors for sweets and teas. But the idea of mint and caffienated tea was foreign to me really. I don't care for green tea's after taste so I was a little leary of trying this one since it contains Green Tea Leaf Extract but thought I'd give it a whirl anyway. Lately I've been getting the shakes after my afternoon cup of coffee and I feel miserable for a while so I switched to this tea in hopes it would perk me up before hitting the gym without the nausea.<br /><br />Not only is this masterfully blended to be tastey I was completely shake free. I couldn't taste the green tea but the crisp mint and warm ginger notes were smooth. I dare say, though I didn't try it yet since it's winter, this would make a fantastic iced tea. The only issue I had with it is that I enjoyed it so much I let myself try a cup after dinner one night and was left wide awake and clear headed into the wee hours.<br /><br />I recommend this one for tea lovers who like a smooth mint tea or green tea as a refreshing afternoon pick-me-up (just not too late or you'll be up all night like I was). It should be noted though that this one and some other Yogi teas contain Stevia Leaf which is not considered safe during pregnancy. Check with your doctor to be sure, I know some say no caffiene at all while others say a little is okay.

review/text: There's a place for this bold tea in my cupboard.  This tea really does not fit a typical category because it mixes black tea, green tea extract, kola nut and an array of spices.  The spices overpower the black tea so much that I'm unable to sense the percentage of black tea.  Given the long list of ingredients, I suspect black tea is a small percentage.  Bear in mind it also contains kola nut which is loaded with caffeine.<br /><br />At first I taste peppermint, the first ingredient.  After that I sense the black pepper and cinnamon, then the ginger and finally clove.  For a complicated mixed tea, the note of clove is pleasant to me.  However, I experience a long-lasting aftertaste that is like slippery elm with foot-stomping black pepper added.  While it contains black pepper, it does not have slippery elm.  It has spearmint, which I don't notice at all.<br /><br />While this tea seems to defy categorization, I'd suggest using it as a Morning Thunder option.  It has 77 mg of caffeine, and I normally double up my tea bags so that's 154 mg of caffeine for me.  That compares with 1.71 - 8 ounce cups of coffee, or a 13.69 oz. cup of coffee.

review/summary: Not really my cup of tea...
review/text: Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea makes a reasonable strong cup of tea with just a couple minutes steeping. The taste of the tea however is overwhelmed by the spice note, most notably the black pepper and the mint. While the pepper gives a nice warmth to the beverage the rest of the spice family sticks around far too long. I was tasting this tea hours after drinking it. The aftertaste was mildly unpleasant.<br />I don't know that the few cups I've had so far revitalized me. The brew has far less caffeine than a decent cup of coffee so it didn't perk me up any more than any other tea or coffee. I just wasn't impressed. There are far better mint teas out there. I think the only time I might enjoy this tea is if I had a cold or the flu.

review/summary: Add some "ZING!" to your your day
review/text: Yogi tea has been one of my favorite brands over the years. It does not disappoint-- neither does "Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea" -- it IS just that: refreshing. In my experience, it was tasty, and gave me a pleasant jolt, and extra energy.<br /><br />It tastes great with my favorite sweet treats, and I would not be surprised if it could be a great ingredient (strongly brewed) in cookies or even cakes. Try adding Vanilla Soy or Rice (or Almond) milk to this -- on the rocks or hot -- it will be DELISH!!!<br /><br />Approximately 40% (or more) of the ingredients are organic; and "each tea bag contains 70mg caffeine, as compared to approximately 90 mg oin 8 oz of coffee."<br /><br />Each tea bag is also individually wrapped-- which is very nice -- grab a few teabags and stuff into pocket or purse or luggage on your way out the door / traveling/ whatever.<br /><br />The ingredients are impressive - Peppermint leaf, Assam Black leaf Tea, combined with other ingredients including Black pepper, Kola Nut (contains caffeiene), Guarana Seed (also contains caffeine) and Clove Bud (which has "warming" properties, according to Oriental medicine).<br /><br />The box is atttracitve, and also has a "Yoga to Get Fired Up" position described on the side-- the choice of ink color on some parts of the box could be much better -- light brown ink on a yellow background is not highly legible, and for that and ONLY for that -- I give it four stars -- it does not come though, on paper, with its message as well as I think it should.<br /><br />In summation, this pleasant and enjoyable beverage is something I would GLADLY serve to my guests - but it is not a tea I would choose to drink at night -- unless I needed to stay up a little later than usual -- it tastes GREAT, and really does impart a Wonderful "Zing" and a nice caffeine "kick".<br /><br />UPDATE March 2012- I liked this tea so much I bought 6 boxes of it from Amazon-- and am still enjoying it as we speak.

review/summary: Not really minty but very spicy
review/text: When I ordered this tea I was expecting a very nice, refreshing and revitalizing mint tea to mix with a bit of organic cocao powder for my minty chocolate tea treat.  However, even though Yogi boxed this with the title "Refresing Mint Revitalize Tea", it really isn't minty.  The flavor is very spicy.  So much so that I was really shocked by the flavor.  I LIKED the flavor, but it certainly isn't the tea that I thought I was buying by the box cover.  The ingredients are;  Peppermint and Spearmint leaves with black and green tea, Cinnamon, Ginger, Cardamom, Black Pepper, Kola Nut, Clove Bud and Guarana Seed.  All tasty if you want a spicy kick in the butt get a move on tea, but not a revatilizing mint tea.  I give it 3 stars because I believe that the title is misleading.  Refreshing mint doesn't sound like black pepper and cardamom to me.

review/summary: The "revitalizing" has more to do with the caffeine than with the herbs!
review/text: My taste of Yogi Teas has been limited to the herbals.  I do enjoy a strong cup of tea and was surprised Yogi made this.  It is a revitalizing blend, full of herbs that will get your senses moving, like ginger, cinnamon and mint.  Overall, what is giving you a bounce in your step is the 70mg of caffeine.  It is less than a cup of coffee, but not by much.  Still, black tea seems less likely to give people jitters over coffee.  That said, this tea is really good.  I can drink it without milk or sugar, though it is also great with both.  I can brew it twice without it tasting bitter.  In fact, the first time I brewed this, I brewed it minutes longer than on the package.  I got busy and thought I just ruined a good bag of tea and it would be too bitter to drink.  I was wrong.  Even after a 15 minute brew time, this tea was fine.  I got this last week and I am almost through half the package.  I might have to get a box of six of these.  It is perfect for when I run out of coffee and need something to tide me off and I feel I could drink a few cups of this and not get jittery.  I limit myself to one cup of coffee because of this.  I recommend this tea for great taste (mint and spice seem odd in a blend, but are excellent), its inability not to get bitter, even when overbrewed and that it packs the punch of a cup of coffee without coffee's negative side effects.  It's perfect in my eyes and I usually have eyes for only the Irish Breakfast blends!

review/summary: Yogi makes the best tea already...this new one is also great
review/text: My favorite tea is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMD648">Yogi Green Tea Mint Garden</a>, which is just green tea and some mint.  It's great.  So, with an opportunity for a new, somewhat similar type of tea, I was excited that it sounded almost like a cross between Chai Tea and their own Mint Garden.  And I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />To me, this tastes like a cross between their Mint Garden tea and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Q4TPAI">Oregon Chai, Original</a>.  It's not sweetened by itself (OK, maybe a little with the Stevia leaf, but it's a very robust tea that has all the mint, plus all the spiciness of chai teas.  Overall, the taste is excellent.<br /><br />The only downside I can think of is somewhat personal:  I enjoy drinking tea at nighttime, and this contains a fairly hearty code of caffeine:  just under a cup-of-coffee amount.  So, this tea is perfect for everything, except nighttime drinking.<br /><br />Would recommend.

review/summary: A unique tea among mint teas!
review/text: I love tea.  I am positively addicted.  But I have never been just crazy about mint tea.  It was fine, but I never really craved it.  Until this tea.  It is not mint in the true sense of the word.  If you read the ingredients, you will find that there are some unusual items in it, like cinnamon, that add a different taste, but it still tastes minty.  Also, there is stevia leaf included which means that the tea is naturally sweet and does not need extra sugar.  It was good hot, but I made a huge batch of iced tea with it and that was really delicious.  I will definitely buy this one again.

review/text: This was a very interesting flavor experience for me. I expected the mint to be the first flavor to hit my tongue and to be overpowering. Instead a few of the low notes came on first. I was actually wondering, "Where is the mint flavor?" and then it came rolling in. This mint flavor is clean, clear and yet very light.<br /><br />I'm enjoying this understated take on mint tea.<br /><br />Note: Even though this contains Stevia, I still needed to add a little raw sugar.

review/text: So often, the mint teas are like Sleepytime or some other drowsiness-inducing herb tea.  While that has its place, I am happy to have found a tea with the freshness of mint that has *real* tea in it, caffeine and all!  This tea makes me feel like my breath is fresh.

review/summary: Better than Bigelow
review/text: I love all teas  - hot, cold, you name it. When I'm in the mood for a mint tea, I select Bigelow Mint Medley. I find it has a nice smooth mint flavor. Since that is the mint tea I usually drink, I wondered how Yogi would compare to it.<br /><br />The two teas have different ingredients. Bigelow's ingredients are peppermint leaves, spearmint leaves, rose hips, lemon peel, hibiscus. Yogi is organic peppermint leaf, organic Assam black tea leaf, organic spearmint leaf, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, green tea extract, organic black pepper, kola nut, guarana seed, organic clove bud, stevia leaf.<br /><br />I seeped both teas for the same amount of time - approximately 5 minutes (Bigelow recommends seeping for 3-5 minutes. Yogi recommends 4-6 minutes). After seeping, looking at the 2 cups of tea, the Yogi tea is darker -you can tell that there is some black tea included. Both teas are aromatic - the Mint Medley has a nice soft mint smell. Yogi smells like mint, however, it has a more complex smell - there's a hint of cinnamon and it smells a bit sweeter than the Mint Medley. Taste-wise, both teas have a nice mint flavor, however, I found the Yogi tea just had more depth to it: as a tea drinker I can taste that there's black tea included in the blend. There's also a mild tingly sensation after drinking the tea (very very mild tingling). Overall, I found the Yogi tea tasted better and I enjoyed it more.<br /><br />I don't know the accuracy of its claims to get your chi moving. However, this is a great tasting mint tea.

If I had an upset stomach this tea would make me feel better.  Having said all that, the actual taste of the tea is flat and overpowered by the mint flavor.

review/summary: Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea
review/text: This tea has the sweet smell of the Peppermint and Spearmint leaf and the strong taste of the Ginger Root, Cinnamon Bark and Black tea. It also contains Cardamom Seed, healthy Green tea Leaf Extract, Stevia Leaf, Kola Nut, Guarana Seed and Clove Bud, all ingredients are Organic. There is also 77mg of caffeine (an 8oz cup of coffee is about 90mg) which I'm guessing is where the "energy" comes from. Each tea bag is sealed in it's own envelope and easily makes a 16oz - 20oz cup of tea. So I get much less caffeine than an equal amount of coffee.<br />I'm a big Tea drinker but I've never tasted anything like this before. It's very unusual and It's good. I would purchase it again and recommend it other tea drinkers.

review/summary: Tea with a Punch
review/text: I usually drink non-caffeine herb tea and just plain mint is one of my favorites. I can't stomach chamomile, so I'm pleased this tea does not have that ingredient.  I'm not sure that I feel more "energized', but as it has caffeine, I'm sure I'm not sleepier. (-: According to the box it ha 77 mg of caffeine, which compares to 90 g in 8 oz of coffee. Overall, I like the taste and the smell. I have several other boxes of Yogi tea in the cupboard and as I usually drink tea at night, I'm more likely to reach for those at home. I think I'll leave this one at the office and we can have a cup when the coffee pot is empty, but we wish there was one more cup.<br /><br />One of my friends thought the first sip was a bit of a medicine-y taste shock, but she said it kind of grew on her. Also, she said it leaves a nice aftertaste. Another friend thought it was "softer" than regular black tea and it's not very bitter. Overall, we like it.

review/summary: Wow ... yeah.
review/text: I'm sitting here at 10:40 at night and probably have no business drinking anything with Revitalize in the name that informs me it has black tea and "energizing" (in italics, no less) herbs, and yet...<br /><br />I picked this because I'm a tea person -- hot tea, ice tea... I'd also purchased this brand -- Yogi -- before from the health food co-op and have been pretty happy.<br /><br />I drink my tea unsweetened and I have to say I think this is very tasty and minty. Not only can you taste the mint, but it leaves pleasantly lingering taste, and -- if this makes any sense -- it always feels like I've been using Vicks, that warmness. Even though the Yogi people are not specifically claiming this, I'd make this if I were feeling a little under the weather and congested, I think it would work nicely.<br /><br />It has ginger and cinnamon bark in it as well, which are not only great for the immune system but two of my favorite flavors. I mentioned drinking tea unsweetened, and I think that's an even better decision when there's a little spice in the mix, not to mention stevia which adds a hint of natural sweetness. Mint is definitely the predominant flavor, but I believe the ginger and cinnamon add a little richness and stop that strong mint flavor from being off-putting.<br /><br />Do I feel revitalized? Unfortunately -- it's now 10:45 PM -- a little  bit, definitely. It seems like it would be a nice way to start the day or a midday boost, and I could see blearily talking my husband into making me a cup.<br /><br />I'd definitely buy this!

review/summary: Good stuff! Smooth, mentholated, caffeinated, delicious!
review/text: Yes, recommended! Yogi has succeeded in making excellent mint tea without that cheap "hot toothpaste-water" taste or smell that lesser mint teas can have. This is the good stuff. :-)<br /><br />* FLAVOR: Great! This tea has a deliciously smooth and truly complex black tea flavor laced with with a mentholated buzz of mint. The tea tastes slightly sweet even without sugar, and 'sparkles' a little against the tongue.<br /><br />* ENERGY: Great! This tea is extra-caffeinated, beyond the usual. For comparison, a serving of espresso has 100mg of caffeine, ordinary coffee 80-135mg, and black tea usually has 50mg. This tea has a mix of black & green tea for a total of 77mg. It's really nice to get coffee-like levels of caffeine in a quality tea instead.<br /><br />* TIPS & TRICKS: Brew longer for more kick. On the box, Yogi recommends up to 6 minutes compared to a usual tea brew time of 2-3 minutes. Yogi also suggests using two bags for even more energy. That makes sense, you can double your caffeine that way. The flavor does become noticeably darker and richer after about the 3 minute mark, but it's still good stuff.<br /><br />Enjoy! :-)

review/text: This is a refreshingly balanced black mint tea that can easily be made much like a usual black tea -- with a usual amount of organic sugar or honey and a usual amount of milk -- as I just did, with an excellent batch of hot black mint tea resulting. So, likely any kind of milk will work well with this rich tea. This is unusual in my experience for many mint teas -- which are many times overwhelmed by such additions. Some typical weaker mint tea variants need delicate handling and are better only iced with only a little sugar or honey and no milk. Yet the mint is very evident and refreshing and is not overwhelmed by additions to this tea. Also this tea does make an execellent iced tea without milk. So this "Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea" indeed does as claimed by its name +++

review/summary: Refreshing blend of mint
review/text: We drink a lot of tea at our house and I've had about every brand of mint there is.  Some are quite strong but this blend is a more subtle blend of mints that would be impossible not to like.  My daughter adds a bag to a tall glass of water, waits a short time and enjoys it as a cold mint drink.  I prefer hot tea, so pour boiling water over the bag, steep for a few minutes and then sip.  Each of us leaves the bag in while drinking, and my daughter really likes the string and tag because they aid her in keeping control of the bag while drinking.  I also like the foil pouch it comes in, as I can keep a teabag or two in my purse so that when I'm visiting a friend I can enjoy a cup of my own tea, even if they don't have any flavors I like.  The foil bag is very strong so does not come apart in my purse, and keeps the tea fresh.<br /><br />Update: I've been drinking this for a couple of weeks now on a daily basis.  It took me until early this morning to make the connection that during the same period of time, I have been having difficulty getting to sleep.  I finally checked the ingredients list more carefully and noticed two ingredients designed to keep you awake.  First is black tea, which contains caffeine.  Second is guarana.  I have some experience with guarana and am perhaps more sensitive to it than most, but I cannot sleep when taking it.  Yesterday I drank a cup of tea at 3pm and went to bed exhausted at midnight.  By 4am - 13 hours after drinking the tea! - I was still wide awake.  So it is not that I'm drinking it right before going to bed - I'm drinking the tea during the late morning to mid-afternoon time period and it is still wreaking havoc with my sleep patterns.  I'm so glad to have figured this out and wish I'd known it earlier as quite honestly, it would have factored into my rating of the product, which I am now unable to change.  So - buyer beware.  By all means try it but be aware that it might keep you up more than you want it to.

Too many flavors for real mint, it gave it a dirty funny taste. I think they tried to do too much here. I see where others loved it, I just did not. I don't think I can drink anymore of it. Be cautioned if your looking for a minty, chocolate tasty treat, this is not it. Too many flavors give it a muddy strange taste. I'm sure I will get slammed for my opinion, people hate people who disagree with them here on Amazon, but in good conscience I could not rate this any better.

review/summary: perfect energy booster for non-coffee drinkers
review/text: Our local Walmart recently got rid of its entire inventory of Yogi teas. I bought on clearance a couple boxes of the Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea, and also a few boxes of the Yogi Vanilla Spice Perfect Energy. I have been a daily drinker of Yogi herbal teas for years, but I had never heard of these two varieties. I was intrigued by the fact that they both combine black tea with herbs and pack as much caffeine as a small cup of coffee.<br /><br />I admit it -- I have to get up very early in the morning and never get enough sleep. I need something to help me wake up, and my stomach can't handle the acid in coffee. I usually drink chai in the morning and enjoy it, but it doesn't have enough caffeine to sustain my alertness throughout the day (and I try not to consume any caffeine past noon, because I don't want to be sleepless at night).<br /><br />I was excited to find these two teas because they are the perfect compromise: just enough caffeine to keep me going, but not enough to make my heart pound. Both these teas have a delicious sweet taste, but I find myself preferring the mint variety early in the morning. Beyond the caffeine (which takes about half an hour to kick in), the sharp but refreshing mint aroma is an instant wake-up call. If you tend to have stuffy sinuses or a dry throat when you get up in the morning, this tea can soothe those problems immediately.<br /><br />It took me a while to find Revitalize tea on Amazon. If you click on "show all Yogi teas," this product is not displayed. I was dismayed to think that the tea had been discontinued, just as I was discovering it! But when I specifically typed "revitalize" into the search engine, it did come up. Now I can purchase my first six-pack (and just in time, because the boxes I got on clearance at Walmart are almost finished). I am sure this won't be the last time I'll buy this wonderful tea. Please, Yogi, don't stop manufacturing it!

review/text: This tea not only delivers a little energy boost, but it has a really nice flavor--the mint is quite strong (maybe overwhelming for some), but it feels really great going down--very refreshing. I usually drink it hot, but this would be awesome iced on a summer day, especially with the cooling effect it has.<br />I definitely recommend this over coffee, which may give a stronger burst of energy initially but wears away more quickly and can give you the jitters. Tea is definitely a better way to feel alert for a longer time without that hyper feeling, not to mention its other health benefits like antioxidants.

review/text: If you love mint, then you will like this tea.  If you only like mint as an added flavor note, then this may be a bit too intense for you.  I enjoyed the flavor.  I had not had mint tea before, but I love lots of different teas.  I was surprised at how much it reminded me of eating food with chewing gum in your mouth if you eat anything with it.  I like mine sweet and it isn't bad with lemon if you like it that way.  The mint is dominant and strong, so it may not be suited to all tastes.  I didn't really get an energy burst from it, so I can't really comment on how that feels.  I probably wouldn't regularly buy it, but it isn't bad.  If you like mint, give it a try.

review/summary: Best GF noodles around
review/text: This stuff is fantastic.  My girlfriend and I have been through every kind of wheat-free pasta around: corn, rice, the arcane stuff.  Great tasteing and good texture.  They are forgiving if a bit over or under done and reheat like actual wheat pasta.  Cannot reccomend enough, we go through 20lbs a year easy.

review/summary: Great Deal
review/text: If you can get these on sale, these can be a great bargain. They come in small packages and don't need to be refrigerated or frozen. The Chicken flavor in the Pasta Sides is my favorite. Quick and easy to prepare. Just add water and butter and pop into microwave for 10 minutes. For extra flavor, add fresh parsley, carrots and/or cilantro if you like. Also, add a dash of dry white wine and a pinch of sugar if you are feeling really adventurous.

review/summary: Knorr needs new recipes....
review/text: When my son had Knorr Pasta Sides Beef 2 weeks ago, he puked it up 2 hours after he ate the stuff. He told me it was good stuff, so I thought I would pick up Knorr Pasta Sides Chicken, and guess what, he puked that up too! But, it was good stuff, according to him. He can tolerate the rice, but he pukes up the pasta sides. Perhaps Knorr might recall all the pasta sides as they may have a puking agent in them?

review/text: I do not like the pasta and sauce as much as I like the NOODLES and Chicken Sauce.  It was my fault that I did not read the whole nine yards so to speak.  The fettucini is not my favorite.  I will double check next time to make sure it is EGG NOODLES.  But it is not all bad, and I am sure I will be able to consume the whole lot.

review/summary: Tastes differ: yucky to some is best-ever to others
review/text: My two favorite granola bars are Kashi chewy bars, all with the typical 7-grain mix: first Trail Mix, then Cherry Dark Chocolate; my spouse always opts for Dark Mocha Almond. To me, the Trail Mix bars are ideal: not too sweet, plenty of almonds, and good oats-and-granola crunch. The slightly sticky matrix is only enough to hold the bar together, without overwhelming the ingredients. The 140 calories (a bit less, for the other two bars) are nicely balanced: 6 g protein, 4 g fiber, 6 g sugars, and 5 g fat. No high-fructose corn syrup, no saturated fat, no cholesterol; low sodium (95 mg). Food, instead of candy (like the usual breakfast granola bar, with only 1 or 2 g protein) or medicine (the high-protein or high-fiber sports bars). I love the taste of Kashi Trail Mix, enough that I have to ration myself to two a day. Maybe the 1-star reviewer got a bad batch? Or maybe it's just that tastes differ.

review/summary: Healthy snack food for the kiddos
review/text: My three year old daughter and her friends love Veggie Booty.  While it's not my personal favorite (the powdered spinach, kale, and carrot are a little weird for my palate, though my husband likes it pretty well), a bowl of it brings toddlers running like pigs to the trough.  A bag will feed about six hungry snackers, and you can feel pretty good about it, since it is made with natural ingredients, and is a good source of green stuff.

review/summary: This stuff ROCKS!
review/text: Veggie Booty is very yummy.  Both my toddler and I love it, and snack on it regularly.  I'm thrilled to see it's available in 1 oz bags - that is the perfect serving size, and this way it can't get stale.  (Um... and it will help me control my serving size.)  1 oz counts as 1 starch and 1 fat if you are tracking your food exchanges.  It is crispy, flavorful, a tiny bit salty, and really addictive.  It has a high vitamin A content too.  It's a winner!!

review/summary: Odd, but it grows on you a bit
review/text: At first bite, this turned off 4 of us.  The kids, who are veggie nuts, and eat raw spinach by the handful, did not care for the snacks at all.  The adults kept nibbling, thinking it might get more palatable with time.  We eventually decided to try it as a snack with red wine, as the slightly salty slightly bitter taste might blend really well with a hearty wine.<br /><br />I expected more judging from the other reviews, and I guess I should have just seen "spinach and kale" and realized that I should not have bought 24 bags to try something new.  Still, it's not awful -- just a bit odd.  Perhaps I will test mixing it with the caramel booty!

review/summary: Love pirates booty! :)
review/text: The cheese kind used to be my favorite, now the veggie definately is!  To be honest it always taste a little funny the first couple bites (TOO much like veggies, ick!) :)  but then after those couple of bites I just cant stop!  Its nice to have a tasty crunchy snack that i dont really feel guilty eating! :)  I also let my toddler snack on them too and I am the mom that doesnt let him have any junk food (no chips, cookies, candy, etc)<br /><br />Since there are no preservatives i love the little bags because if the big one isnt sealed properly the whole things goes stale SO fast.<br /><br />The small size is also SUPER handy to keep in my purse or the diaper bag.  I keep a box of these in the closet so I can just grab it and run.  (I also have not been able to find this size and flavor in any stores)<br /><br />One of my absolute favorite snacks! :)

review/summary: Not healthy enough to be worth eating such a vile food!
review/text: I actually love Pirate's Booty snacks so I was over eager and purchased 2 huge cases of these.  Yikes, these are going to hard to get rid of.  A previous reviewer states that they are like fish food and I second that notion.  I would definitely recommend steering clear of these, and choosing one of the much better flavors like cheese.  I don't know exactly how to describe these, but imagine a stale sock soaked in broccoli juice and you're on the right track.  My typically non-discriminating 14 month old turns his nose up at these.  These taste like something super healthy, and though they aren't bad for you, they are not healthy enough to warrant choking them down.  They are worth a try as a toddler snack, but I'd order cautiously or you will have lots of fish food tasting snacks that you will be trying to give away to any unsuspecting victim that will take them off of your hands.

review/text: Having tried and liked several flavors (e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JIN1H2">Pirate's Booty, Aged White Cheddar, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DMTKQC">Pirate's Booty, New York Pizza, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>), I thought why not give these try.  They were a big hit.  The puffs have a hint of flavors that you might find on a spice rack (e.g. Basel, Parsley).  I found them a welcome departure from the cheesy flavors.  Bottom line, I give these a solid A and would recommend to others.
