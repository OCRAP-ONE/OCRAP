review/text: I tried a free sample of this in the mail.  I love it.  It measures and tastes like sugar but does not have a single calorie.  You can bake with it, use it in your coffee, or sprinkle it on fruit.  To me, it does not have an aftertaste.  The only problem is that I cannot find it at grocery stores nearby my Colorado home.  I ordered it through Amazon and will again, once I use this up.

review/summary: Awesome sweetness
review/text: I love love this product. A friend recommended this brand to me through a food thread on a recipe website. I can't buy it locally, so coming here to amazon is my go to place. And when I'm going through other towns and come across it..I buy what I can and stock up. I can't rave enough about this line of sugar replacers. This is a great quality product. I have used the confectioner's sugar in this line to make sugar free frostings for cupcakes with success, it's also the only line that has a confectioners' sugar which makes it "ideal" to use. You really can't go wrong with using any one of ideal's line of replacers subbing for real sugars. Thank you very very much.

review/text: I've tried all the artificial sweeteners on the market, including the new Nectresse. All of them have an aftertaste, except Ideal. Even my mother, who detests artificial sweeteners, couldn't tell that it wasn't sugar. I use the Ideal brown sugar as well, though I haven't tried it in cooking yet. I used to be able to get it at my local supermarket, but I can't find it anymore. I've been ordering it from Amazon for a while because I could get it in larger packages than in the supermarket. I just wish they would bring back the 350 packet size.

review/text: Out of all the artificial sweeteners that I have tried, Ideal is the closest to sugar in taste. I'm allergic to pure Stevia and beside that, I don't like the aftertaste anyway. So I am very happy to have found this product.<br /><br />However, the only problem I have is that the amount of "empty" sealed packets in the boxes are increasing. I can deal with a few here and there, but now I can't open a box without getting several empty packets per 100ct box. I'm beginning to feel ripped off. :(

review/text: I have lost 85 pounds and Ideal sweetener has helped. I tried every artificial sweetener and this is the only one I will use. I love to bake with it. It tastes great with no aftertaste. The one problem I had was leaving a baked item on my counter and when I left the room my dog jumped up and ate it. This product is poison to dogs. It has a warning on the label. Luckily we took her to the vet right away and $1000 later she was fine. I still use Ideal but I label everything I bake with it and keep it out of reach of my dogs.

review/text: I have tried many sugar substitutes, including several of the Stevia products. To me, the Stevia products left a bitter after taste. Until I discovered Ideal, I had never really felt that the substitutes compared well to sugar. Ideal is different. It doesn't alter the taste. I feel like I'm actually having sugar in my tea and coffee. I have also used the brown sugar substitute and have been very pleased with its taste, also.

review/summary: Love Ideal! but can't find it locally anymore
review/text: I've been using Ideal for about a year now and love it. I had heard on a tv show that not only is Ideal a safer artificial sweetener, but Xylitol can be beneficial for teeth... and since I was having an ongoing issue with mine, I decided to try it in it place of Sweet & Low, Splenda, and Stevia, which I had been using for years. I have to say it made a believer out of me right away. Within a week my teeth issues were gone, and I've used it ever since. Problem is, now I can't find it at Albertsons anymore. I've checked 4 stores near me and all of them have stopped carrying it. I'm puzzled as to why, even though the Ideal website says that's where you can buy it. So I'm glad to find it on Amazon.

review/summary: One of the best baking cocoas you can buy
review/text: Disclaimer: I like darker, more acidic chocolate for the fruitier flavour and so favour natural process over Dutch for cocoa.  (eg), single origin Tanzanian or Cuban chocolate.<br /><br />I've been using Ghirardelli cocoa for several years now, and it is without question one of the best.  It doesn't clump up, so it blends beautifully even with cold ingredients - very important for many recipes and especially so for making cold chocolate milk :)  And since it is natural processed, the taste is very rich and deep.  For taste it beats out Hershey, Fry's, Nestle, Callebaut and Droste.  Depending on what you're making, it's either on par with or better than Cacao Barry Extra Brut and Valrhona.<br /><br />I like Ghirardelli better for more dairy heavy recipes like drinks and mousses as I think dairy really brings out the flavour, but Barry and Valrhona work better for baked goods where there are other flavours and alkalis that will mute the subtleties of the taste of the cocoa anyway.

review/summary: Far better than expected!
review/text: I bought this mix on a whim, not expecting much. I used to think beans tasted more or less the same, didn't matter where you got them. I was so wrong, these beans are something else!<br /><br />  The lentils are amazing! They keep their shape very well, no bursting like with the grocery store brands. They have a rich texture that reminds me of ground beef. Perfect to help a beginner vegetarian like myself make the transition easier. Cooking these with a can of coconut milk is highly recommended.<br /><br />  The garbanzo beans are just as great. They take roughly a third less time to become soft than the store brand I was used to. The garbanzo beans have a much bigger inherent flavor than the lentils(obvious to chefs), so you are gonna need to season it well. I cook these with a vegetable bullion cube + cinnamon + chipotle powder. Delicious.<br /><br />  For the sprouters out there, the lentils sprouted after about 18hrs, the garbanzo beans took about 30hrs. They grow vigorously once they have sprouted, so keep a close eye on them.<br /><br />  As for negatives, I can think of one. The lentils require at least 2 good washes so you can get all the hidden dirt out. Seriously, wash them. I soak all my beans to lower the cooking time and phytic acid level (everyone should) and I was surprised by the amount of dirt that had accumulated on the bottom.<br /><br />  I will be buying these again. I have had family members compliment me on my new-found cooking skills. They don't know that that the only thing that has changed are the beans themselves.

review/text: I bought these on a whim because they were on sale on Amazon one day and I am SO glad that I did.  My family and I love chocolate, caramel and pretzels and this is the perfect mix of those flavors in a crunchy, salty-sweet treat.  Both canisters were properly sealed and the pretzels were fresh.  After being open for about a week they started to get a little stale but they were so popular with my kids that they didn't make it much past a week before they were devoured.  I can't say enough good things about these pretzels.  Also, we ordered them in the fall and even though we live in Florida, they weren't melted.  Good packaging Amazon!

They are not overwhelmingly sweet either, just a nice balance of the thick pretzels and the candies  -- great with coffee or a latte.  Hope to see the peanut butter FunkyChunkys on Amazon soon!

review/text: Himalayan Sea Salt is a relationship-saver for us.  He likes to put salt in and on everything, and I shy away from that both for taste and health reasons.  However, after reading several articles that discuss the health benefits of this (and other non-processed) salt versus regular table salt, and trying it in a number of dishes, we have reached salty equilibrium. My only criticism of the Himala salt is that it works out to just under $7.00 per 7-ounce bag, but my Whole Foods is selling loose Himalayan sea salt right now for $7.99 a pound.

review/text: I have been using Himalayan salt now for over a year and agree that it's the best salt on the earth.  The taste is mild and smooth, has no after taste, and it doesn't seem to cause any thirst issues when added to foods.  The minerals in it are good for you, and it has no chemicals and is not heat processed.  Your body doesn't treat it as a foreign object, like it does with commercial salts with only sodium & chloride.<br /><br />I buy multiple grinders and give them away as gifts to friends who also care about what they are putting into their bodies.  I've even read of people keeping it in their purse to use in restaurants (I haven't gone to that level yet).  The price is high compared to other table salts, but it's worth every penny.  I will never buy commercial processed salt again as long as this salt is available.  I just keep refilling my grinders!

review/summary: Our Favorite Salt
review/text: Do a taste test. Wet your finger and dip it in some standard table salt. Then repeat with the Himalayan Sea Salt. Notice the difference? We sure did. The Himalayan Sea Salt is not as harsh or bitting, and has a sweeter (yes sweeter) aftertaste. A little less than two years ago I started trying different artesian salts. So far, the Himalayan Salt has been my favorite. It has a mellower flavor, though it is still just as salty. There are also the studies that show it is better for you than your over processed and recently made table salt. I am not sure about that, but I know I like it. If it has trace minerals and no pollutants, so much the better. I'm not sure what the benefit of getting the larger grains and grinding them down yourself, but if you enjoy ritual then this method might appeal to you. I prefer to use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SAOKIU">Fine Grain Shaker)</a> version.<br /><br />It costs a little more, but I think it is worth it. At least try it and see for yourself.

review/summary: Excellent salt
review/text: This salt has amazing flavor, and adds a lot more than ordinary salt does to your food. The company that makes this salt uses wind power to generate the electricity to package and deliver it. And, quite by accident, I met the owner of this company at a slow money conference in Vermont, and she is really nice, one of the most green minded, socially responsible business owners that I have ever met.

review/summary: worth its weight in salt
review/text: This Himalayan Sea Salt is worth every penny. It is clean, less biting than other sea salt. I feel it is a bit sweeter than normal salt, while my wife says it's a more mineral taste. Compared to sel de mer, this Himalayan salt is more versatile - it can go with bolognese, seafood, and burgers equally well. And as another reviewer said, it's light pink color makes for good table conversation.

review/text: Heavenly to be able to order beautifully cut, authentic prosciutto in small, economical amounts.  Used right, a 3 oz. package goes a long way -- we had it with melon, stuffed in chicken, and shredded in a creamy pasta sauce.  A really great deal at this price when used sparsely to enhance dishes.  Not enough here for more than one good sandwich, but added to sandwiches, egg dishes, sauces, chicken or veal dishes, etc. etc. etc., it gives plain dishes a gourmet flair.

review/summary: Super Hot Sauce
review/text: The label on  Frank's Hot Sauce says "The Perfect Blend of Flavor and Heat" and I must say this is an accurate description of the product.<br /><br />Frank's Hot Sauce is outstanding.  It's a Cheyenne Pepper based hot sauce that is not too hot, not too sweet, but has just a perfect blend of "flavor and heat."  It's not like Tobasco sauce which is very hot and you sprinkle on items.  It's a different kind of sauce (I love Tobasco).  Frank's is a hot sauce you can use more liberally to your liking because, while it's hot, it's not so hot you can't really dig into it and enjoy the rich flavor and spices.<br /><br />I like to use this sauce to dip chicken tenders in, but you can also use it too cook buffalo wings, put it on eggs, French fries, burgers, whatever you like.<br /><br />I like this size because I use a lot of it and it goes fast at smaller sizes.<br /><br />I highly recommend this hot sauce.

With others sometimes I feel like I really have to watch how much I add to dishes or it can get out of hand quickly, cverpowering other flavors.<br />Frank's won the America's Test Kitchen/Cooks Illustrated taste test. So if you trust those folks, they've done the leg work for you!

review/text: It is a "comparatively" mellow hot sauce in the sense that it is a condiment a pepper sauce lover can slather on like ketchup or salsa.<br />It has less of a vinegar flavor than tabasco and you can taste the flavor.<br /><br />If you like any kind of sauce with "insanity" in the title, Franks is probably not for you. If on the other hand<br />you are making buffalo wings for the wife and kids, want to spice up pepperoni pizza, scrambled eggs, or a cheeseburger<br /> then Frank's is right up your ally.

review/text: I live in China, and this is a product I am unable to find where I live. Whenever we travel to the States or my in-laws pay us a visit, Frank's RedHot Hot Sauce makes it to over to the Middle Kingdom. I prefer this product in their 1 gallon plastic containers because of the sheer size. My wife uses Frank's Hot Sauce when making me some mean buffalo wings, and I've also enjoyed the sauce mixed with rice. My wife has laughed at me, but I think it's absolutely delicious! We haven't used the sauce with a lot of other recipes, however I feel it would go well with many dishes. I almost want to drink the stuff. My eight-year-old is not big on spicy food, but she actually likes this hot sauce in small quantities. Although I don't find Frank's RedHot Hot Sauce to be very hot, I feel it has just the right amount of kick. If you are looking for something hotter, I recommend Frank's RedHot Xtra Hot Sauce.

review/summary: Excellent Hot Sauce!
review/text: I've always liked hot sauces, salsas and spicey foods . Tabasco was my first choice in hot sauces originally and I still enjoy it now and then. But then I discovered several different wonderful brands of Louisiana Pepper sauces and I grew to like them better than Tabasco. Then one day when a store didn't have any Louisiana brands available, I picked up a small bottle of Frank's Red Hot Cayenne Pepper sauce as a temporary substitute. It was made in New Jersey. New Jersey? I thought all hot sauces of any quality came from the Gulf Coast States. This stuff just couldn't be any good!<br /><br />Well, surprise! This stuff is a very good hot sauce. In fact, it is better than most of the Louisiana hot sauces I have tried, and it is less expensive. It'll brighten up any number of dishes, especially things that come with tomato sauce. I use it along with ketchup anywhere I'd use ketchup alone. Delicious!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Mild heat combined with too much  vinegar.
review/text: This is a mild hot sauce. That means you can apply it liberally and it's unlikely you will make any dish too hot. So it is user friendly.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Aged cayenne peppers, distilled vinegar, water, salt - etc<br /><br />Why 2 stars? This sauce lacks any character beyond a heavy dose of vinegar. If you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you'll love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base. I don't like anywhere near this much vinegar. I've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are many better ones.<br /><br />What is interesting is that the original Tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to Franks once it is diluted.<br /><br />You will find mention that this sauce was top rated by Cooks Illustrated. That is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test, done in 2005, comparing only three hot sauces!<br /><br />Suggestion: Since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then buy it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size. They cost little more than the smaller sizes.<br /><br />I'd encourage others to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar - you just might prefer it.<br /><br />Try any of these:<br /><br />a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section! No vinegar.<br /><br />b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the Mexican section. It has a hint of vinegar.<br /><br />c) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Extra Hot Sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much. Another great blend.<br /><br />d) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar. Still it is much better than Franks.<br /><br />e) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. A lot of vinegar but far less than Franks. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.<br /><br />In my opinion, all of the above are far superior to Franks.<br /><br />If you like Franks and are at the least bit curious, you should try any of these other hot sauces

review/summary: Flavor over Heat
review/text: Hot sauce has been a staple for years for eating at home and away.  The usual product had been HOT Tabasco or bland vinegar-and-stuff.  But a single bottle of Frank's Red Hot was innocently left over at the supermarket shelf, and I've never gone back to any other sauce, bar none.  Its magical blend of different cayenne peppers with a final product that is truly FLAVOR over heat won me over.  The distinctive flavor is fascinating, and seems to ADD a special magic to any appropriate food ( I would NEVER splash it on oatmeal, but a good Corn Polenta is unforgettably good with Frank's Red Hot).  It really makes little sense to add just heat and ruin a good thing.  FLAVOR and heat make for indescribable magic!<br /><br />  However, if you want a truly HOT sauce, just for the sake of INSANE HEAT, I would recommend looking up the miniature "Caballero" pepper, which is sensationally hot.  It can get people to suffocate with its mortal heat!

I was a little apprehensive about ordering since it is glass but no longer. Fantastic! I also love the hot sauce. I grew up with it in Wisconsin and could never find it in stores in Mississippi. It's the perfect blend of heat and sweet and thicker than the very vinegary Louisiana style hot sauces that are popular in the South. Will continue to order from Amazon until I can find it locally.

And yes, after filling out the first rating you sent me, I did write to them to give them the benefit, but after 2 days I received a short note telling me what I had ordered - **the other offer, which I did not select because of elevated shipping FOR 1 POUND.  I was not allowed to return the item, BUT was told they would offer me a discount on 4 MORE lbs. of the product from them! Not interested in giving them more $$.<br /><br />My email:<br />After filling out Amazon's customer feedback for my purchase I read their note to contact seller regarding issue before posting feedback. So, I am willing to give you the benefit before submitting a #1 rating.<br />I ordered a 5 lb. Mercken's Block of Vanilla Caramel. You did have another listing for a 1 lb. block, as did other sellers. But this listing stated a 5 lb. block with what was elevated shipping. I figured it all balanced out and placed my order. The price was good and I had bought Merckens before. I even went back to the listing at checkout before submitting my order because the number of pounds was not listed in the order & I questioned the integrity of the sale. But it did state 5 lb. in the offer. I asked for no special shipping. When my order arrived, I could see clearly that it is packaged for Priority USPS mail in a 1 pound block, even though I still haven't opened the box. My last purchase was of Mercken's. I feel you clearly misrepresented this offer. And I honestly have never encountered this before when purchasing from Amazon. I could have purchased Petterson's Caramel for nearly the same price for a 5 lb. block and have also used that brand. I do not want just 1 lb. and definitely do not want to deal with anyone who is less than honest with their advertising. Will you accept return of this package?

review/text: Bewleys Irish Afternoon tea is the best tea I've ever had. I discovered it in Ireland and couldn't believe how good it was. Made properly at Bewley's Tea shop in Dublin! When I brought it home to the States and made it [properly!] : ) it was STILL the best tea in the world. SOOO glad to find a place to purchase here in the USA.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003H7FGSY">Bewley's Irish Afternoon Tea (25 Individually Wrapped Tea Bags)</a>  Happy Nonnie!

review/summary: Nueske's Smokehouse Bacon.... Seriously good stuff
review/text: If you are a bacon head, here is your bait:  Nueske's cherrywood or applewood smoked bacon.  Pricey?  Yes.  Worth it?  Well. we sure think so.  This is NOT your typical grocery store off the shelf stuff whether peppered, thick cut or what have you.. This is custom made bacon and it is different than the grocery store fare.  Share it or savor it for yourself...  I think it needs to be shared personally, but I am not everyone.  Enjoy it and keep a bit on hand for those special times when just regular stuff won't quite do.

review/summary: Get together for tea...
review/text: As a classic Seattle tea, this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea. When I drink this tea, I am home again. This tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of Seattle in one cup.<br /><br />This is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors. You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness. It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Fabulous Tea!
review/text: MarketSpice Tea is the best tea I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying.  Whenever I visit Seattle, I do ensure my first stop is Pike Place Market.  I stock up on this tea, take it back home, and then throw my stock into the freezer for months worth of future enjoyment.  It's also great that I may also replenish my stock right here at Amazon as well!  Do know that it does go rancid if not stored properly.  I find that the freezer the best place to store and prolong its life well after expiration.  This special blend of black tea with natural spices, cinnamon, orange peel, and essential oils is quite pleasing to the palate.  If you haven't had the pleasure of sampling this tea, do so!  You won't be disappointed.

review/text: I discovered this tea on a trip to Seattle years ago. I was so excited to find it on Amazon so I can keep drinking it. I love iced tea and the flavor of this is out of this world. Also, because it's so naturally sweet, I don't have to use any sugar or artificial sweeteners which I'm trying to avoid. I can't recommend this product highly enough. I'm addicted. You do need to be careful because of the essential oils. I make my iced tea in a glass jar. And, make sure to wash your hands after handling the teabags.

review/text: I have been drinking Market Spice tea for many years.  It used to be that you could only get it in Seattle at their little shop.  Now, thanks to Amazon, this great tea is available with a click of the mouse.  Quite frankly, there is no other tea like it - I have tried to find something at various times over the years - it is just unique and one-of-a-kind.  I do a pot each afternoon with milk and raw sugar - brings out the flavor, but not necessary to the pure tea drinker.  It is just the best tea...

review/summary: Big disappointment
review/text: I have been buying Market Spice tea for years, and still believe it is the best tasting tea. But I was hugely disappointed with my last order. The tea was dried out and weak. It used to be that you could make two strong cups of tea with one tea bag. In the newest batch, one tea bag would only make a single weak cup of tea. If I wanted to get the full Market Spice flavor I have come to love in the past, I had to steep the tea for about 5 minutes in a smallish cup.

review/text: I tried this tea while at Pike's Place Market in Seattle a couple of months ago, and I had to buy it.  It has so many delicious flavors, kind of reminds you of Christmas with the spice and citrus mix.  The natural sweetness ties it together and creates a wonderful dessert tea (or really, anytime of day).  Even if I let it sit and cool down, it still tastes great.  I highly recommend this tea, and I will be purchasing more as I run out of this first bag.

The ingredients listed are not detailed, that is one thing I would like to change because it lists natural and artificial flavors and I would like to know what those artificial ingredients are. I am very cautious about artificial products and this has diminished my crazy desire to drink is all the time but a good cup of tea is a good cup of tea and this Market Spice tea is a good cup of tea.  Yum, yum yum, Enjoy!

review/text: This is easily the best tea that I have ever had.  I drink quite a bit of tea and I always come back to this.  The tea is so strong that your fingers have a fragrance just from touching it.  If I want a tame, smooth tea I usually have P&G Tips or an Earl Grey.  For something with a little more flavor, I typically have Twinings Vanilla Chai or Lemon spice.  When I want something with a lot of flavor, I have Marketspice.<br /><br />I haven't tried any of their other teas because I don't see how it could be any better.  This tea is incredible.

review/text: I am a tea drinker and have never drank coffee. Seven years ago I drank a variation of teas but never had a favorite until I tried MarketSpice Tea. I got hooked on it and have since drank no other tea.(The taste is phenomenal). At my place of employment I would have my tea cup on the counter and the aroma would catch people's interest with remarks on it's amazing aroma. Unfortunately 3 years ago the business where I purchased the tea had closed and no other place in the city carried it. So in desperation I went onto Amazon and found out I was able to order the tea through them. I was saved. Since then I have ordered through Amazon and have been so pleased with how easy it is and the fantastic and quick service I have received from Amazon and MarketSpice. I am never without my tea.

I never have to add any milk or sugar to it. I just drink it as is... and I love it.<br /><br />(p.s.
