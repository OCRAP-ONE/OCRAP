review/summary: Real Candy Cane Shavings In This!
review/text: This is the best candy cane cocoa, and it has real bits of candy cane. Don't worry, it's not totally sharp... Most of it dissolves in the liquid.<br /><br />I mix my cocoa with a battery operated frother, which uses every single bit of cocoa, so there is not a single bit of cocoa on the bottom.<br /><br />After, it's really a pepperminty cup of chocolate that is very lovely. Refreshing, I'd say.<br /><br />This is a must with milk, though I think you can do it with water... but milk is best to get the full flavor effect.

review/summary: Stephens Gourmet NSA Hot Chocolate
review/text: If you've read the other reviews about Stephens hot chocolate, well, the same for this one. It tastes rich and good. I'm diabetic type II and there is nothing else in hot chocolate that comes close without being loaded with sugar. Diabetes really narrows the field when it comes to things you can eat or drink so am glad that Stephens makes this product. In every shiny white cloud there is a bit of soot hiding somewhere. The lump of coal is that they don't sell it in Canada and won't ship across the border. That is so sad. Canadians having to deal with yet another item they can't get. Not sure why this is whether US government, Canadian border guards with a grudge, or Stephens just don't want extra paper work. Thank goodness for friends who go on trips down south and bring it back for me. Good stuff.

review/summary: Yummy and warm in my tummy!!!
review/text: Make per directions and use half & half to top off for richer taste, maybe a little whipped cream topper and you have have a melt in the chair, soft spot, where visions of sugar plums and the like may begin to dance in your heads.  Yummy and so delicious.  I've purchased twice, first at near $13-each for two, then near $5-each for six of them - chalk it up to when you're buying!  I should make clear that I do not regret my initial purchase, I was merely showing an example when timing can play a part in the value of this kind of transaction.  Please allow me to elaborate that I initially selected Chadwell Retail sellers as I was trying the product, and it seemed reasonable given the value for two to select them to complete my purchase.  I have no qualms with the seller and would openly consider their services on this open market again as the purchase made sense.  Thank you for reading this far and for your consideration in advance.

review/text: I also tried the Cherry Chocolate and Peanut Butter Cup flavors and they are amazing!  So thick and creamy, especially if you make it with a little milk!  What I really like is that they aren't overly sweet, and that it mixed together very well, unlike most brands that just clump up and stick to the spoon.  Definitely my favorite hot chocolate!  The cider flavors are great too!

review/summary: Not exactly sure how to rate this
review/text: I bought this mostly based on the reviews. I really wanted hot chocolate from Stephen's, but amazon didn't have it. I stumbled across this and thought I would try it. It is white, even though "cocoa" is in the title...in case you didn't figure that out! I did realize it wasn't chocolate, but didn't really know what to expect.<br /><br />The best way I can describe it is that it tastes like a vanilla milkshake, but hot! I happen to love vanilla milkshakes way more than chocolate ones (but hate drinking milk, go figure), but somehow, I haven gotten used to this product after about a week. I have 6 cans now, so I have many more opportunities to try! It may just be that I sort of mentally "expect" hot chocolate and I have to retrain my slow brain! It is interesting and different, and I still drink it, and almost like it, but still would pick pick the hot chocolate over this. Definitely worth a try if you like vanilla.

review/summary: The richest tasting hot cocoa I've ever tasted.
review/text: I bought a can of Stephen's hot cocoa over 5 years ago not realizing how good it was going to be. After I drank the first few cups I was hooked and could not find it anywhere again. I ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the UK with me when we moved over taking care to make them last. I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way. If you'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. You really don't need marshmallows.

Now everyone I know buys it and I'm even happier to be spreading it around. My only issue is that I wish they would have a mixed pack; a 6 pack of mint, hazelnut, regular, dark, vanilla and irish cream would really be perfect!

review/text: I love all of the cocoa in the Stephen's Gourmet line, but I think this one is my favorite. The other people in my family have different favorites (we all love Stephen's), but we all agree the Belgian Dark ranks at the top for the best all-purpose drinking cocoa.<br /><br />I like my cocoa with a little added milk in it, and starting out with a good DARK cocoa allows me to achieve that milky texture without sacrificing that rich chocolate flavor.<br /><br />As an added bonus, Stephen's cocoa is labeled "Gluten Free" -- taking the guesswork out of choosing a cocoa for those of us who must avoid gluten-containing additives such as barley malt (a common ingredient in chocolate).

review/summary: Taste is individual
review/text: I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.<br />vs<br />Nestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.<br /><br />Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Nestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1g<br /><br />I first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldn't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate.

It is definitely not up to the level of Archer (Target brand), Twinings (some grocery stores), or Cadbury (overseas or very few grocery stores).<br /><br />Cocoa is the 4th ingredient. No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient. That's more like it.<br /><br />Stephen's chocolate has bad/very light color, little aroma, thin, doesn't dissolve. A very disappointing purchase.

Just as with good coffee, its not necessary to make it overly sweet or flavored since there aren't that many sweet-freak-fatties drinking it. The ancient Incas didn't use any sugar at all with their chocolate!<br /><br />I did give it an extra star just for having a dark chocolate drink product since their aren't many companies that even make one, so kudos to them for that.

review/text: I bought some of this chocolate for my mother who can't have much caffeine. She used to drink Nestle hot cocolate, fat free-caffeine free, but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches. Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephen's on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its "food". and the company who makes it basically said "Sorry, but it sucks to be you". So here I sit, 110 dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use.

They now use cheap 'maltose' (barley malt sugar - HIGH glycemic 105) in place of most of the honey, and only a miniscule amount of the herbs which were so effective in the original formula.  HUGE disappointment, and shame on POP for corporatizing and cheapening their once-outstanding products.<br /><br />As with the other reviewer, I once recommended this to everyone.  Now I will go out of my way to steer clear of recommending anything by Prince of Peace.  Try Source Naturals Wellness homeopathic cough formulas - they're much cleaner and work pretty well.

review/text: I love really good coffee and, in fact, go to great lengths to brew the best i.e. freshly ground beans, purest water, immaculate coffee maker, etc. I have been extremely happy with virtually all of Jeremiah's coffees; and, I have a number of different beans on-hand at all times. The Breakfast Blend is stand-out. Also, try this and their Fogbuster. You will not be disappointed. AAAA++++

review/text: The Jeremiah's 5lb bag of Ethiopian coffee is often sold-out, so I've been looking for a good roast with similar value. I'm OK with a more medium roast, but this coffee seems more mild then I would have expected. Still a good deal, but I wish it had more flavor. In general, I've had good luck with Jeremiah's brand, although sometimes the bags are not as well-sealed as they should be.

We used to take our change to the local conveniance store. They came in grape, cherry, and orange, lime and other fruit flavors. Those were very good. But there are also the big 21 inch thick plasitc tubes that hold the equivelant of 20 of the paper ones. This offer gets you a case of 48 packs of 3 tubes each in grape, maui punch, cherry, and orange flavors. Lots of fun from the Willy Wonka factory.

review/summary: Not like the wheatgrass in stores
review/text: Only one store in my area, Sprouts, sells wheatgrass in their produce section. Whole Foods sells it, but it is a goodly distance from my house so I only get wheatgrass from them once in a great while. I have a bunny who enjoys wheatgrass as a treat, so I go to Sprouts to get it for her, but wanted to grow my own since it is expensive and requires frequent shopping trips. So I bought these kits and decided to grow it myself. First I have to say I was impressed at how quickly they shipped my order. So I planted the seeds on Friday and by Sunday night, I had wheatgrass sprouts like crazy. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and deliver abundant grass as promised.<br /><br />I have to say, though, that the grass doesn't look at all like the wheatgrass in stores. The blades are way taller (8 inches) and about twice the thickness of the wheatgrass I am used to buying for my bunny. I took pictures but discovered that my camera's memory card doesn't fit this new computer, so I can't show prospective buyers a picture of it. Rats. Since bunnies have sensitive digestive systems and you have to be careful what you feed them, I don't feel safe feeding this grass to her. I can't return it because I aready cracked open the kit and grew grass from one of the three seed kits. The grass is probably fne, but as a bunny owner, I want other bunny owners to know that this grass isn't like the wheatgrass in stores, jut so they aren't surprised and disappointed like I was.

review/summary: Bright flavor, smooth on the palate
review/text: I tasted this Matcha from Rishi the first time today. The flavor is bright, assertive and fresh. It mixes nicely into both hot and cold liquids, leaving no clumps of tea at the bottom of my glass after it was whisked. The tea powder is fine, giving it smoothness, no grittiness or grainy feel. I had it both in water and with milk; in both the flavor was not muddied. The flavor is more intense (bold) than most Matcha I've had, making others seem bland by comparison. Nothing off-putting, just seems more concentrated. It has a good crisp green color, and each packet holds about one tablespoon of Matcha. I am glad this order was for a pack of 2 because I can see myself going through one box quickly.

review/summary: Great tasting but a bit pricey .
review/text: This is a great tasting tea. I know it is a very healthy and nutritious tea. But in order to have one of these a day I have to be willing to spend at least $60 a month for this tea. That's two dollars a pop and after it ads up I simply can't justify the expense.<br /><br />I mean, for crying out loud, it's a sixteen ounce cup of tea. I know people spend more at Starbucks for something less healthy but I just can't afford to have this everyday. I can use that sixty bucks for a lot of other things. In fact, I decided to use the sixty dollars and buy dark green leafy vegetables at the supermarket along with other nutritious vegetables. Actually, I only need to spend a fraction of that amount per month and I get a lot more food.<br /><br />I know the polyphenols are supposed to be the highest quality in Rishi green tea but I will stick to buying Kirkland brand (Costco) or Treasure Island's green tea and save quite a bit of money.<br /><br />An acquaintance of mine told me about this tea and how it was really good for the immune system. Due to my challenges with illness and deciding to follow the advice of a person who spoke highly of the health benefits of this tea I decided to buy it. Unfortunately, I get blood work done on a regular basis and after nine weeks there was no noticeable change/improvement to justify the expense of this product. It did nothing to improve my health and the lack of improvement in my blood work supports this. So I am no longer going to buy it. I would buy it if I could pay around $20 for a month's supply (for just one tea serving daily), but not $60. It's not worth it.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this product four stars is because it does taste very good. Especially with a few droplets of liquid Stevia extract added to the mixture.

review/text: I waited quite a while before following my impuslse to buy SMOKED SALMON AND SPINACHE MOUSSE, manufactured by GOURMETFOODSTORE.  Of course, it's expensive, and I ahd to save up for it.  And it's quite caloric, as well.  However, the picture of this gourmet treat finally DID get to me, and...after returning to this picture and this product several time.....couldn't resist it any longer.  For me, it was my "royal treat", to celebrate the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton!<br /><br />Well, my package arrived a bit after the wedding, (today, actually) --but that's because I ordered it a bit after the wedding, (May 6, to be exact.)  I kept reminding myself how expensive this really is, and how even the Queen saves money whenever, and wherever, she can....but it was no good.  I had to at least TRY this stuff...at least once...<br /><br />The package, marked "Perishable", had stood out in my hallway for a few hours, as I was out this morning.  Upon opening the outer cardboard box, then the inner styrofoam box, (repleate with cold-bags, to keep the pershable food inside fresh),  I came across a small brown-cardboard box which held my Smoked Salmon Mousse.  Inside, was not one big package, as I had expected, but, instead -- to my delight -- sixt small black plastic tubs!  It seems, happily, that no matter how much you order of this Somoked Salmon Mousse, it will always be packed in these elegant little black plastic tubs.  The black contrasts nicely with the Smoked Salmon Mousse peeking through both sides of the large yellow label, that almost -- but not quite -- covers the food within.  The label says "Terroirs d'Antan" in big letterss, and I take it this means "land" of Antan, (and not "terrors" therefrom),<br />as "terre" means "land" in French.  Three ducks on one side and one rabbit on the other side of the central "Terroir's d'Antan" are "inhabiting" the yellow label, and we can see, in the far right distance, a huge building that looks like a French chateau -- and, indeed, right below this, in smaller letters, are the words,<br />"The selection 'Terroirs d'Antan' revives ancient recipes from the vearious terroirs of France.  Enjoy."  But further down the label, it is revealed that the product was 'Made in USA - Distrib by Optimus, Inc., Miami Fl  33138.<br /><br />The larger box in which this individual serving, (actually, containing 3 servings -- 7 ounces), black plastic box came, described the contents as being "Packed in Aspic".  And so it is.  When the vaccum-packing, transparent plastic covering is removed, there still is another transparent layer to be removed.  My own experience with "aspic" had heretofore been, mainly, with learning of the title of a movie, "A Dandy In Aspic", starring the late, (and really great), Laurence Harvey.  I have yet to see the movie -- and have never, really, known what 'aspic' is, exceptthat it is some sort of foodstuff.  Well -- I discovered, upon taking what must be aspic off the top op of the salmon mousse, that it is similar to the temporary, plastic 'dots' that are sometimes used to keep products on cardboard backings, but are (somewhat) easily removed.  A type of transparent jello, actually -- about 1/8 inch thick.<br /><br />Well, finally I had the mousse in front of me, and it was time to eat it!<br /><br />The flavour was milder rhan I had expected -- perhaps because "Cream Cheese" is the first ingredient.  The smoked salmon flavour DOES come through, on occasion, and it is a nice, dark, smoked salmon flavour, indeed!  But there is far too little of this wonderfully rich smoked salmon flavour here.  (Maybe my taste buds came upon a "pocket" of the salmon that had not thoroughly mixed with the cream cheese.  In any event, this product should have been labled as "Cream Cheese and Salmon Mousee", because "cream cheese" is the first ingredient listed, and "smoked salmon" is the eighth ingredient listed, (out of 17 ingredients), and "spinach" is the fourteenth.  (This product was made in the USA, remember -- and if I remember correctly, ingredients here must be listed in descending order.  But -- does this<br />"in size" order apply to titles too?  If not, it should...<br /><br />The smoked salmon mousse has, again, a very MILD flavour.  it tastes very UNsimilar to the NY-type "lox" I had hoped it would.  Here, the amount of cream-cheese SO overwhelms the amount of smoked salmion, that it ALMOST tastes like exotically spiced, and flavoured, cream cheese!<br /><br />The little black "tubs", however, are definitely re-usable.  Of a size similar to restaurant trays for artificial sweetner, they are happily made of "No. 5" plastic.  According to an "Organic Gardening" article I read a while back, ONLY No. 5, or No. 6 plastic are safe to reuse.  So, these little black tubs can be used to hold sugar and artificial sweetener packets, stray coins, business cards, tea-bags, or any other similar object(s).  They can also be used as "portion-control" containers, as they hold not-too-much, and not-too-little of any food -- including, (for reference), about five rounded tablespoons of tuna spre<br />trays for<br /><br />"Vita" foods, (available in New York's Waldbaum's supermarkets, and probably other areas as well, sells a someked salmon and cream-cheese spread, at 8 ounces for under $3.  Ir does not have spinach, chives, eggs, tomato, or many of the other ingredients in this Smoked Salmon Mousse, sold by GourmetFoodStore. It comes in a white, round plastic tub.  As it has more smoked slamon in it, it tastes more like smoked salmon to me.  As it's kind of inconvenient for me to go to a land-based store, I certainly hope Amazon will offer this VITA product, and others, (like their herring in wine sauce), soon.  otherwise, I'll save up for, and load up on, this Vita product when next I go to Walbaum's.  The 'Smoked Salmon and Spinach Mousse Pate - All Natural," being reviewed here, DOES have more "snob" appeal, and DOES come with those nice little space-saving black tubs.  But, unlike the Vita smoked salmon and cream cheese spread, it has more smoked-salmon taste.  And that, when all is said and done, in the end, the main thing that matters in foods, doesn't it?<br /><br />P.S.  One More Plus:  The "GourmetFoodStore" catalogue which is included with every pruchase is an education in gourmet food, all by itself.  Did you know HOW MANY types of smoked salmon there are?  HOW many types of caviar?  Whether you buy anything (else) from "GourmetFoodStore", this catalogue is not only mouth-watering...but very educational!  Made on fine "slick" paper, and filled with beautiful cloured photos, (and also high gourmet-food prices), it is a "gourmet" catalogue in more ways than one!  Thanks, GourmetFoodStore!<br /><br />One More Minus:  Sadly, my food came packed in "peanuts".  No -- not the edible type of peanuts....the STYROFOAM type of peanuts!  It's impossible to open ANY package packed in styrofoam peanuts, without getting at least some of these innocuous-looking, but incredibly annoying little pieces of styrofoam, all over your floor! GourmetFoodStore is not the only manufacturer/ seller who does this of course....but one would think, with the wonderful, (and espensive) gourmet products they sell, that this up-market marketer would pack their food with something less annoying to the customer?  Of course, there IS the TINY advantage in having something packed in peanuts...one gets forced excercise picking up these small, but aggravating, strofoam peace-of-mind-destroyers, off the<br />floor.  OK -- a few calories are used in this way, and, if you are female, you can imagine yourself to be Ruth, (from the Bible), doing some gleaning.  However, I prefer to have MY fantasies when I desire to have them, and to excercise when _I_ decide to excercise, and NOT have these things suddenly and unexpexctedly forced upon me when opening up a package -- especially from such a luxury-goods emporium as GourmetFoodStore truly is.  Perhaps a $1 charge for having one's goods "not to be packed in peanuts" might be applied?  (PLEASE don't make it more than $1!)  Bubble-wrap and similar plastic space-fillers are SO appreciated by customer!  And less aggravation leads to less buying of calmatives and pain-relievers....possibly allowing for MORE money to be spent at GourmetFoodStore!  Please consider these "suggestions for happier custumers", dear GourmetFoodStore.  Thanks!

review/text: The mushrooms that were sent were not labeled like the picture, they had the old red and black label. When I opened the can and tasted them the had a very metallic taste and the inside of the can was discolored so I threw them away rather than take a chance of making myself sick. There is a date code on the top of the can of 0303 which I have no idea what that means and I can't find any explination of this code online. I will not buy this brand mushrooms anymore. I am a mushroom lover and I have bought many large cans of mushrooms in the past and I have never had them taste like these did.

review/text: I love liquor-filled chocolates.  I received these as a gift and found the gel-like liquor not to be very strong.  It was almost as if the liquor had been cut with sweet syrup and all the alcohol cooked out. A young child wouldn't even get a buzz from these.  The chocolate itself was OK -- better than Hershey's and Nestle but not as good as Godiva or Lindt.

review/text: This product is great. I have never tried any liquor filled chocolate candies/chocolates but I got to say, these were a great little surprise. I am not good at describing food or candy, but these were little bottle shapped chocolates that are filled with liquid, which is nicely mixed with liquor. Some of these were stronger than others in a sense that some of them you can really feel instantly, while others you only taste chocolate.<br /><br />I shared these with my friends and they seem really happy when they tried it. There are four different chocolates. I would definitely recommend this to everybody. You just have to be careful, these chocolates have liquor in them so use at caution. Great little gift...for myself :)

When she opened her gift to find this, she shined the only cheese smile and said " you know me so well". She couldn't wait to try  them. According to her the Jim Beam is the strongest and the Remy Martin least strongest if I'm not mistaken. They are great tasting and the filling is a gel consistence and the chocolate great as well. Only thing i didn't like was the dents on the packaging, noting really to complain about or call the company about cause my best friend loved it either way.These chocolate liquor bottles are a great gift for anyone who loves chocolate and liquor and don't mind them together.

I lose approximately one piece a pack by pressing just the wrong way and having the gum shoot out of the package like a cannon, forever lost.<br /><br />The gum itself is decent, lasts for slightly less than a twenty five minute car drive, packs a comfortable punch, and improves breath. Still, it's not outstanding, and doesn't overcome the poor packaging, so won't be buying any more.

review/summary: Real stevia extract with no additives
review/text: This is real stevia extract without any additives. Most of the companies that claim to be selling stevia are really selling stevia extract combined with other things, like fiber or artificial sweeteners, but this is the real deal. It's extremely sweet, which means you only have to use a small amount at a time, and you should melt it with hot water if you plan to put it in a cold drink. Stevia also tastes a little . . . different. (Some describe it as tasting like licorice, but I never thought so). I suggest starting with the smallest amount and then upping the quantity until you find a level of sweetness that tastes good to you. Because of stomach problems, this is the only sweetener I use, and I like it very much. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Great product - mixes easily and value-priced
review/text: Sweet Leaf Stevia Extract is powdered, pure stevia.  There are supposedly 400 servings (1/40th of a teaspoon) in a .4 ounce container, so it works out to be a fairly inexpensive natural, non-sugar sweetener and dietary supplement - less than 2 cents per serving and 1.5 cents per serving with Subscribe and Save - though it will take you a long time to use up one container, let alone four.  This extract has the sweetness of 300 - 360 times that of sugar, is a Kosher product, and it contains no additives.  Also the .4 ounce container is fairly small and has a shaker top, so it is easy to carry with you and use if you are away from home.  You could even attach a very small spoon with a rubber band to the container if you wanted to be even more precise with your serving sizes.  I started out using this in tea and I am now using it in my coffee as well.  It mixes fairly well in hot drinks.  It's easy to get used to the flavor in tea, but may take you some time in coffee. I think that it's worth it to take the time to get used to the taste.  The end result is that for every teaspoon of sugar or serving of artificial sweetener that you ingest in your coffee or tea during the day, you will be substituting a dietary supplement that has been shown to be healthy to your gums and in some studies to lower high blood pressure.  Every teaspoon of white granulated sugar has 4 grams of carbohydrates, 4 grams of sugar and 15 calories.  If you normally have 5 teaspoons of sugar during the day in your hot drinks, you would be saving 75 calories per day - a good portion of the recommended 100 calorie per day reduction to help with long-term weight loss.  The flavor of this pure extract compares very favorably with that of ground stevia leaf (blehhh!) which if you add it to tea will just float on the surface.  Also as compared with Truvia or other stevia plus other sweetener products, it is considerably less expensive and the taste is pure - not multi-layered.  If you want to enhance the flavor and it doesn't conflict with your diet regimen, consider adding a squirt of honey or a dash of table sugar to your beverage.  I am looking forward to perfecting a hot cocoa recipe.  Chocolate and cocoa seem to mask flavors very effectively.  I am not sure how to use stevia for baking.  That will take some experimentation and most likely require combining stevia with other wholesome sweeteners.<br />In all fairness, I have only tried Truvia once in tea, and I found that it had an almost cooling effect on my tongue and considerably less sweetness than stevia.  Many sweeteners come in single serving packets, and as a result they are considerably more expensive per serving. Why not start with a pure product?

review/text: SweetLeaf Stevia Extract is the best tasting sugar substitute I've ever found, either for beverages or for cooking; but it's VERY concentrated, so it takes a bit of experimentation to get it to taste good; but after you've found the amount you like best, it is absolutely fabulous; it even has a nice slight aftertaste (that when adjusted properly), makes it taste even better than plain old sugar;<br /><br />another drawback is that it doesn't mix easily into liquids, but with practice, that becomes no problem either; it's much better than another SweetLeaf product SteviaPlus that's supposed to mix more easily; but SteviaPlus has a weird taste that's not nearly as delicious as Stevia Extract & it doesn't mix that much better either;<br /><br />I just wish Amazon would always keep in stock the larger size 0.9oz Stevia Extract containers; sometimes the small ones are all that's available

review/text: my 26 month year old spotted these on his own while shopping at the supermarket and I had to overlook the $8.59 for 3 oz bag and just be glad that was what he was asking for.  the amazon price is somewhat better but higher then Just Tomatoes actual website.  I only question why at this price is all the fruit not sourced from the USA?  I find that a bit hard to believe but I guess everyone has to make a living. some of the fruit is from Vietnam.  The crunch of the fruit satisfies when in the need for a snack.  the fact that he is getting used to a non sugar snack as a special treat hopefully will establish his appreciation for fruits in their natural state.  the 3oz bag does have a lot in it more then I would have thought before buying.

review/summary: how many days for priority shipping?????????
review/text: Can't say much about the product itself.  was a gift for friends in California who had just given birth and it arrived 5-6 days after shipping totally melted.  The seller gave early warning before shipping stating the weather had been abnormally hot and that they could not be held responsible for packages missed and left to sit in the heat.  I assumed that was not an issue considering my wife was at their home and aware the package would be arriving and I had also purchased priority shipping (additional $8+dollars).  No such luck.  Be sure whoever you are buying these from gives you absolute specifics before you buy.<br />Just to be fair, I have to say the seller was very quick and courteous with responses to my concerns.  Unfortunately she didn't even consider any form of compensation though.  I really hate throwing money away and giving a less than memorable gift at the same time.

review/summary: fragrant, delicious, and cheap
review/text: Vanilla beans typically run 6-10 dollars for two at major supermarkets. Those prices make me reluctant to use them in most dishes that call for them, and instead I use vanilla bean paste (Williams and Sonoma sells a very good product). But these beans are such a good deal (less than a fifth the supermarket price) that now I'm willing to use them with almost reckless abandon. Vanilla beans really do provide superior flavor to things like rice pudding and custards and vanilla ice cream, a more complex, more luxurious flavor than vanilla extract does. These beans arrived fresh, fragrant, and tightly bagged. They're Madagascar vanilla beans, considered by some cognoscenti to be inferior to Tahitian beans, but not being one of the cognoscenti, I can't detect much difference at all. This product has made me a fan of internet grocery shopping.

review/summary: Excellent Buy!
review/text: Vanilla beans in our area cost $6 for one and up to $11 for two.  I like to make my own vanilla extract and I also like vanilla flavored sugar which requires whole beans.  I probably have a lifetime supply of vanilla beans now, but with Amazon's excellent price on this item, I can use them freely and order again if I need to.  Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: I will never buy vanilla beans at the store again!
review/text: I purchased a Cuisinart electric ice cream maker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JGRT">Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice-Cream Maker, White</a>this summer as well as a couple of great recipe books (The Perfect Scoop by David Libovitz, and The Old Fashioned Ice Cream Cookbook by Joyce Deuker). Most of the recipes in each book call for vanilla beans (in fact, almost insist on them!) - have you priced them recently? Yikes. So I turned to my trusty Amazon.com site, searched for vanilla beans and found these. I could not be more pleased - they are moist, flexible and have a very nice flavor. I particularly like that they come in packages of two, so the remainder stay fresh - who knew vanilla beans weren't crunchy! After I have soaked the ice cream mixture, I dry the bean and put it in a jar with sugar so next time I see a recipe for vanilla sugar, I won't have to scramble. I highly recommed this product.

review/summary: I freeze them
review/text: This is a good deal on whole vanilla beans, which I mostly use for making my own extract with Everclear.<br /><br />I stick them in the freezer to preserve, so it's worthwhile buying so many at once and getting the bulk deal on these.

review/summary: Best Vanilla Beans
review/text: Great product for the price. Only negative would be the packaging. Since I keep mine in the freezer a single package of 24 or 30 or whatever would be sufficient. I make "Chocaluah", a coffee-chocolate liquor for adult use as a syrup over ice cream. These beans add additional depth to the flavor of the sauce.

review/text: Purchased for making homemade vanilla ice cream.  Slightly smaller beans than expected, but overall flavor and price outweighs expensive local bought beans.

review/summary: Great value!
review/text: I have a small gourmet catering business and have a couple of dessert items I use vanilla beans for.  One recipe calls for 3 full vanilla beans for each recipe!  One can image how expensive that would be at $4 - $6 per bean!  This Melissa's box was an incredible buy at just over $1 per bean...the beans are supple and their flavor is very good.  As another reviewer mentioned, they are not the most coveted bean but for most purposes they are excellent!  I highly recommend this purchase for anyone who uses a lot of vanilla beans or who can find someone to share them with.  I don't know how long they will remain fresh because I haven't had that issue, but as quickly as I use them, I don't expect to.  This is a tremendous value!!

review/text: Bottom line, this made my cat projectile vomit. I've never had a problem with him eating Friskies before but, I knew "Cheezy Craze" just didn't sound right. It came as a sample in one of the larger bags. Not fun to clean up after partial digestion.

review/summary: how many?
review/text: My cats go crazy for the Party Mix and mainly the cheese flavor. It sells for $1.50<br />to $1.89 a pouch in my local stores, so I was looking on amazon hoping to find a better<br />price. I looked at this listing because of the price of $6.48, assuming it was for several<br />pouches, like most of the other listings here. But no number of pouches was listed and the<br />only indication comes from looking at the shipping weight: this ia apparently the price<br />for a single pouch. This is a problem with amazon--quantities are not always posted<br />and you can really get ripped off overpaying. I saw one review for Friskies canned<br />food, where the reviewer thought she was ordering a multican pack for $12 but the<br />actual number was not posted and she ended up receiving ONE can!

review/summary: Lowers Blood sugars
review/text: I bought the Navitas Naturals Chia seeds.  They are great.  I put them in a shaker bottle.  I use them on sweet potatoes, in salads and coleslaw and just learned that they can replace half of the fat in baking.  At first I didn't know if it was lowering my blood glucose or if it was something else but I confirmed it the other day.  I had stopped using the seeds and my morning blood glucose shot up to the 140's.  I decided to start using the seeds again and within a few days my blood sugars dropped to the 120's and the only thing I changed in my diet was the addition of chia seeds.  I love them.  I haven't made the gel yet I have only used them raw and they are like eating poppy seeds which I love.  Hope this will help other diabetics.  Navitas is a quality product and is very reasonably priced.  I will definitely continue to buy them.
