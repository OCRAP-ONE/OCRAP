review/summary: Just because it's not Orange doesn't make it healthy.
review/text: I bought these because my daughter wanted something for a school snack, had tried these in the cafeteria and said that they "weren't bad".  Unfortunately, she had changed her mind by the time the gigantic box  arrived on the doorstep.  My huband and I tried them, and I feel like giving a stern punishment to the maker of these things.  Besides having no discernable nutritional content, these things have too much salt, too much fake "cheez" powder, and no way to remove it gracefully after you'e eaten a few puffs. We don't like them, and I feel terrible dumping them on the food pantry. Perhaps I'll hide them in a large donation of healthier items.

review/summary: tasty but packaging needs improvement
review/text: This is a good tasting product. It makes good gluten free pancakes which I was in need of. I add coconut oil to mine and they come out excellent.  The only issue I have is the packaging. When you are done pouring your mix out, the zip tab does not work. I guess it would if you spent ten minutes messing with the tab in order for it to line up but I don't want to mess with it. Please XO redo your packaging. Otherwise, good job on the pancake mix. How about a larger bag for a little less cost?

review/summary: You'll love this taco seasoning!
review/text: If you're tired of the same old tomato-based taco sauces, give Fiesta Seasoning a try.  Your tacos will have a much more distinctive and authentic flavor; it's not hot, just fresher tasting.  Not only is it light and tasty, but you won't be seeing the evidence of your meal on your shirt!  We must like it.....I just bought a case of 24 packets, and there are only 2 of us!  My family has used it for years, but since the Chi-Chi's restaurants closed, I haven't been able to find it in grocery stores where I live and travel, so it was good old Amazon to the rescue.

review/summary: Makes meat more special
review/text: I've been using this for years and was delighted to find it on Amazon when my local grocery store no longer had it available.  It's a wonderful seasoning packet for mixing with ground beef (as recommended) but I also use it with ground chicken and with shredded chicken.  It's a taco seasoning, but instead of the predominant flavor being chili powder like most, it's main flavor is green chili and garlic.  It's not hot, just tastey.  I use it for taco salad, corn tacos, flautas, mexican casserole... the list is endless.  If you buy it once, BEWARE!  You will end up addicted and have to order regularly.

Have also told friends and family how we can now get this product.<br /><br />Was sort of surprised when to our dismay we received a Kindell in error instead of our Chi Chi's!!  Being an honest person I called Amazon to tell them what happened and was sent a return shipping tag.  I would have thought that I would have at least received some type of acknowledgement or thank you for doing this.  I could have kept this item and no one would have know the difference!  Oh well I guess in this world sometimes honesty does not pay and we have to do what we feel is right.<br /><br />Have a good day!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Jerry & Elaine Long

review/summary: My favorite seasoning for Mexican dishes
review/text: I finally learned how to make Chi Chi's chimichanga.  It's not an easy recipe and takes many steps, but when I'm in the mood, it's worth it to have a dish I absolutely love.  This seasoning is essential to make it taste perfect.<br /><br />Last night, I took leftover beef stew (actually, it was beef ragout, which has tomatoes and onions, not potatoes in the mix) and added chili peppers and this seasoning.  When it was hot, I put the meat and some cheese in the flour tortillas, then more cheese and gravy over the top and heated it a little longer in the oven.  It made a delicious wet beef burrito.  This seasoning is very versatile.  Though I had to buy 24 of these - I'll do it again and again, when needed.  I've shared them with my sister when she wants to make these dishes and my daughter-in-law.<br /><br />This is not a taco seasoning.  It is a much different flavoring and until you taste it - you won't know.  Yum.

review/summary: Missing ChiChi's, but Amazon to the rescue
review/text: Chi Chi's was my all time favorite restaurant and I am still going through withdrawals. The only hope that I had left was that i was able to buy the taco seasoning in the store, and still try to create the ChiChi's taste in my own kitchen. Than all of a sudden i could no longer find the taco seasoning in the grocery stores. I was devastated. While looking on line trying to find any stores/anywhere that sold the seasoning, I learned that I could get it from Amazon, in which I already ordered from often. I was elated. I ordered a whole case of 24 packages and will soon be ordering more.The ChiChi's taco seasoning (restaurante) is not a red tomato base seasoning, but a tasty garlic and onion taste (if you liked the ChiChi's food you'll remember how there tacos and (meat) was seasoned). Excellent taste!!! Thanks Amazon for coming to the rescue!!! Please don't ever stop selling the BEST taco seasoning around!!

review/text: If you like to make tacos and burritos at home, most likely you've noticed that the majority of brands pretty much taste the same. This one stands above all. It has a unique light flavor that you will love. The first thing you notice is that it doesn't turn your meat orange like the others. It's not overbearing in flavor, yet is very tasty. I have problems finding this locally so I bought this big pack here. I've already used 4 packets. I will keep ordering these as long as they are made. Second to none! If you are looking for Mexican seasoning that is delicious and a little different than the others, you owe it to yourself to try this.

review/text: Let me say that if you hate that "brown" look your taco meat gets after you use other seasoning packets, then look no further. Mexican resturaunts seasonings do not change the color of you meat.  It just seasons it. Whenever I have people over and have tacos, everyone tells me how much they like the flavor of the ground beef.  There is only one store in the city I live that carries this.  I ordered from here and now I do not have to drive all the way on the other side of town.

review/text: I just got my KEURIG single serve coffee maker a little while ago and went crazy here on Amazon looking for different coffees and teas that would work with my system.  I love herbal tea and the variety included in this 22 count set are the flavors I like - good variety.  Sleepytime is my all time favorite.  The Celestial Seasoning teas work great and the set was exactly what I expected.  I am very pleased with it.  But I am not pleased with the price and am angry at myself for not researching prices for this product elsewhere before buying.  So if the price is fine with you I highly recommend this set of 22 Celestial Seasoning single serving cups.  Just be sure to read in the description what you will be receiving and make sure they are the flavors you want.  And also be aware that there are other places to get it much cheaper.  But the teas are truly delicious.  Of that you can be sure.

review/summary: Very Nice Samle Pack
review/text: Very good teas, I love them. I tried this same pack at a time when a good variety of teas were not in the stores quite yet. I have sleeping problems and I drink the Sleepytime every night before bed and it seems to help me stay asleep. The Lemon Zinger is very flavorful as is the English Breakfast. I didn't really care for the Green Tea, it seemed a little bland but 3/4 made this a great buy.

review/summary: Some good some not so good.
review/text: Since this is a sampler I didn't expect all of them to be great tasting. I am not a big tea drinker but I tried all the variations in the sampler set. I think the green tea one was the best and my family drank all of them first. We pretty much ended up with the sleepy time ones left which we didn't really care for. I can't say they are junk because others may like it I guess you just need to try it. Pretty cheap compared to store price and sometimes amazon gives coupons on them so keep an eye out.

review/summary: Variety is not so varied
review/text: I purchased this hoping to try out the different flavors of tea on the Keurig. I knew Sleepytime was my favorite, with Lemon Zinger close behind. Sadly, the majority of this 'variety' pack was the green tea (which I don't like) or black Breakfast tea. There were only 3 Sleepytime in the entire box, and 4 Zinger. Meanwhile, there were 7 Black Breakfast Tea and 8 Green Tea.<br /><br />If you are buying this for Sleepytime or Lemon Zinger, you're better off getting the individual boxes. That's what I'm ordering as we speak. Overall though, the tea is really good! Someone mentioned it as weak on another review and I didn't get that at all. I thought they were very tasty (well, except for green).

review/summary: I am pleased but not thrilled
review/text: I recently purchased a Keurig and of course, being excited had to purchase many different samples of teas and coffess to try out. I searched for a sample pack of tea with flavors I thought I would enjoy so it would not be the same taste every day.<br /><br />Upon receieving this package the first I tried was the English black breakfast tea which was delicious. I added sugar onyl and enjoyed it thoroughly. The second I tried was the lemon zinger, also did not dissapoint. As I continued through the four flavors contained I was pleased with each.<br /><br />Pros: Four different varieties of common flavors<br />  Fast delivery<br />  Good price<br />  Fresh<br /><br />Cons: I have since found it cheaper else where<br />  For a sample pack and merely from the illustration, I thought there would be more flavors<br /><br />Over all, I would not purchase again since I can find it less expensive and because there are bigger packs with more variety. However, the actual quality of this product was good to pretty good and it is more personal preference that causes me not to choose this again.

review/summary: Great Sampler!
review/text: Other reviews have listed this sampler as overpriced, but it looks like it's only listed as $14.05 for the 22pack as of right now. On the Keurig website, if you're a member this box will cost you $13.90 plus shipping (around $15 if you're a nonmember) so the prices are pretty similar. If you're an amazon PRIME member, you can get this with free shipping and it came within two days! What's not to love??<br /><br />Lemon Zinger: very lemony! It almost smelled like a lemon-scented house cleaner at first, but it tastes good. It does have a strong lemon taste, but I didn't mind it.<br /><br />Breakfast tea: I love drinking this when I'm not in the mood for a super strong cup of coffee. I like adding a little milk and sugar to the tea and I think it tastes awesome.<br /><br />Sleepytime herbal tea: I found this tea very calming. It has a nice scent, and it a nice tea to drink when you're curled up reading a book or watching tv before bed.<br /><br />I haven't tried the Green tea yet, but i'm sure it's just as good. I've very happy with my purchase

review/summary: Nice flavor enhancer on certain dishes
review/text: This is not a true balsamic vinegar, it is more of a condiment type vinegar that is made from a base of generic wine vinegar with no specific aging requirements. This does not diminish the quality of this for what it is.  I am stating this up front because this product has uses that a true balsamic vinegar would not. For example, this product is no nearly as complex, allowing you to use it as an ingredient in a salad dressing (although I recommend against that.)<br /><br />A true balsamic vinegar is made from Trebbiano and Lambrusco grapes and is aged for a minimum of 12 years (in addition to only being made in Modena and Reggio Emilia, and designation and production controlled by the Italian Government.)<br /><br />First, why do I recommend against using it as an ingredient in a salad dressing: although it does not come close to the complexity of a true balsamic vinegar, it is still overpowering and relatively complex in flavor and aroma compared to lighter vinegars, such as a red wine or white. This product, unless very sparingly used in a dressing, would completely mask the flavors of the salad herbs and vegetables.<br /><br />I have found that a few drops on fish, and especially salmon, greatly enhances the flavor, as well as most shell fishes. Although I am a vegetarian, back when I did eat meat, a few drops on a piece of red meat also worked wonders. And it adds an interesting and savory flavor to grilled vegetables, especially zucchini and eggplant.<br /><br />For what it is, this is a quality product that occupies a permanent part of my pantry. I also recommend that you check out an interesting companion product - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CFO37Y">Gia Russa Balsamic Glaze</a> - which I have also reviewed and think that it complements this as a staple in your kitchen.

review/text: I have been purchasing Maldon Sea Salt for a year or so and I am always extremely satisfied. I have tried other salts, but with the exception of Cypress Black Flake Salt, no other salts have the same mild salt flavor that the Maldon has. The hand harvesting provides the most amazing pyramid shaped flakes. I carry a small wood box of it with me in my purse and frequently get attention from other diners as I use it. The flakes are crunchy and have a unique flavor. I prefer it to most other sea salts I've tried including Hawaiian Alaea and Pink Himalayan.

review/summary: Caution for small dogs
review/text: We used the product for over 4 years before we learned that it shouldn't be opended and refrigerated for more than 3 days.  For a small dog like a Chihuahua who can't finish a can in 3 days, this restriction is an issue.  We stopped using it.

review/summary: Coconutty!
review/text: My daughter and I have decided that Green Mountain is one of our favourite brands of Keurig coffee: strong aroma and not bitter. I love anything coconut and have been enjoying the coconutty taste of this coffee. It is the one flavour I have re-ordered. It's not all that strong, which I like, but the flavour is unmistakably coconut. Tastes great with milk and a bit of honey.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I am not a frequent coffee drinker because I always found it too strong; my sister finally convinced me to buy a Keurig because they offered so many light roast flavors. Island Coconut is BY FAR my favorite! It smells amazing as it brews and the flavor is heavenly. I hope that Green Mountain Coffee considers making this one of their regular flavors instead of a Limited Edition. I highly recommend this flavor!

review/text: Wow...this is a delightful, fresh coffee from Green Mountain. I did not know what to expect it to taste like as I am not real fond of fruit type flavored coffee, but I like coconut allot. The taste was fresh, clean with just the right amount of coconut flavor. I highly recommend this coffee to anyone who adores coconut or for those that want something different. It is a seasonal type coffee, so get it while it is available. Thumbs up Green Mountain!

review/summary: That's some weak coffee!
review/text: My roommate and I tried this one because she really likes the Kona Island blend from Coffee People. The first time we tried it was this morning and we brewed the largest size (travel mug sized). It was extremely weak and the coconut flavor was really strong.<br /><br />We brewed another generic kcup in the smallest cup size and mixed it then split it into two cups for each of us. It was a great cup of coffee, but it was a DYI process.<br /><br />Brew in the small size and then brace yourself for the taste of a melted coconut snowcone in your coffee.<br /><br />I will be honest that I do like it and I am glad we have it, but if you are in great need of coffee and you like something strong, go with something else.

review/text: This is an excellent after-dinner coffee.  It's smooth and mild, with a hint of coconut flavor and a nutty coconut smell.  I drink it in the mornings sometimes too, but I usually prefer a bolder, darker coffee to start the day.<br /><br />Tastes great with just a little cream and sugar.  My only complaint is that the price is a little high, but I'm not reviewing the cost - just the flavor.

review/text: I do love this coffee. It's the first flavored coffee that really tasted like it said it would. It has a hint of coconut and is nice and mild. I could drink this any time of the day or night..I tend to like a tad stronger coffee in the morning to get my day started but sometimes I like to change up on that too.<br /><br />Also love the fact that there are 24 cups as opposed to usually 12 in the stores..This is a very good bargain as well.

review/text: This flavor from GMC is our favorite, gets everything right. It's just rich enough for my taste and mild enough for my husband. The coconut smell and taste is amazing, and there is something else that seems to add just a little sweetness to the after taste. We also like that it's fair trade certified. With as much as we drink this flavor, we just wish it were sold by the pound to make a whole pot of it at one time :). Thank you, Amazon, for offering it at a great price as well.

review/summary: LIGHT ROAST, NICE COCONUT FLAVOR
review/text: First let me start by saying I'm not into very strong coffee.  I'm a one to two cup a day coffee drinker and found this to be a perfectly light roast with a nice smooth coconut flavor.  Great for a second cup without getting the jitters.  I am also a fan of coconut and flavored coffees.  I can have a cup of Island coconut in the afternoon for a little pick me up or to curb my appetite without worrying about being up until all hours of the night,  It tastes a bit like you had a coconut candy 5 minutes earlier and the taste is still swirling in your mouth.  It has a nice aroma.  I can't see drinking it everyday but with a little fat free half and half and some truvia, it feels like a little desert.  I'm sure it would be delicious over ice in the summer.  Get it while you can, from my understanding it is a seasonal product and very hard to get other than the internet.  Can't beat the $12 +/- price tag for a pack of 24.  Look for sales and free shipping.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious!
review/text: We have been buying the flavored cffees for the Keurig machine for over a year. So we have tried many.  I first picked up the Island Coconut in a famous kitchen/bath store. I loved it from day one. It has a slight not too over powering coconut taste.  Slightly sweet without any added sugar.  Although i do put a little splenda in with mine when I make it. ONe thing that i don't like is that we were told this is a seasonal flavor.  Summer.  WEll when we went to buy more it was no longer available and it was the first week in June.  I was so excited to find it on Amazon. Ordered several boxes.  So when you see it, buy it. You will love it.

review/text: My wife and I never dreamed we would like coconut flavored coffee, but after one taste of this it has become our favorite flavored joe. It is extremely smooth, with just enough coconut to accent the coffee but not overwhelm it. We occasionally like to add a chocolate flavored creamer to it make a pseudo Almond Joy flavor. It is a shame (and incomprehensible to us) that this is a seasonal offering, so we try to stock up/hoard this whenever it is available. Perhaps GMCR will come to their senses and make this a year-round offering soon.
