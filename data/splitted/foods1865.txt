review/summary: Greatest honey ever
review/text: Discovered this honey a couple years ago, and just opened our second can.  I forgot I had it for a while - and just remembered it tonight when serving some biscuits.  Man oh man, if you like honey, you must try this.  It is indeed nothing like the typical grocery store honey, to me it has a fragrance and flavour like some kind of varnish. That sounds weird, but it is intense and lingering.  I love it.<br />Also, less important but the tins are so beautiful and really worth keeping long after the honey is gone.

review/summary: a sweet symphony in a can....
review/text: This is the edible equivalent of a great piece of classical music; the flavor is so complex! Never tasted anything like it from the teddy bear bottles to the raw/unfiltered tubs or even farmer's market fare. Wonderfully fragrant - thick and lusciously floral. My favorite way to enjoy this honey is on a warm piece of challah or brioche style bread with just a touch of clotted cream on top; can't think of a better way on a Sunday morning to spoil yourself rotten.

review/summary: Our Favorite Last Minute Dinner
review/text: In our house, we love this stuff! I found the price here on amazon to be much better than the price I was paying at the grocery store ($2.59/box). Plus, it's often sold out at the grocery store anyway. It makes a great meal because it cooks up so quickly and is delicious! It's a spicy version of alfredo pasta and is so yummy!<br /><br />We always add in a few scoops of frozen California style vegetables to the pot before we bring it to a boil. Then it cooks right along with the pasta. The veggies are a tad on the soggy side, but this could be corrected by adding them a little later, I assume. They're just not soggy enough for me to want to bother with that.

review/summary: Lacking except for cloves...
review/text: I consider Tazo organic chai tea as the classic flavor with a little more than just cloves and cinnamon.<br />I think I could probably make a better chai at home with a few more spices. I should have read other reviews before I purchased this since I can't even return it. It just has a really horrible lacking taste about it that is not satisfying like other chai tea brands with combination of several spices as it should be made with. I have gotten the Davidson's English breakfast and children's tea before and love them, but the classic chai is a major disappointment. Even Stash brand from Jewel tastes better than this. It just smells wrong to begin with. It's more like clove cigarettes.

review/summary: If you love CLOVE you should buy this
review/text: I am a Chai Tea fan several years ago, I even prepare my own mix from scratch, but when I am rushing I like to prepare it with the tea bags, and I have tried several brands but so far this one is the worst, the clove taste is exaggerated and unfortunately it overwhelms the rest of the ingredients, the lack of pepper is acceptable, but unless you love cloves this tea is not for you. I added some ground cinnamon and nutmeg, and it corrected the flavor little bit.

review/text: My husband, who has traveled to India and experienced Chai in that environment, loves this tea. Amongst all the Chai that is on the market today, this is the one he prefers. I think it might be the zing that I attribute to hot pepper that has been added to the tea mix. I am not as fussy about my chai as he is but I prefer this tea also. Try it, you'll like it.

review/summary: Makes AUTHENTIC gumbo is 1/5 the usual time!
review/text: I lived in Louisiana for 15 years before moving to New England, so I've had LOTS of gumbo. Making gumbo from scratch can take as long as 3 hours  from cooking the meat to making the roux and then putting it all together to simmer. But Zatarain's (pronounced Zat-uh-ran's) is my quick solution.<br /><br />Just follow the directions on the box and add 3 stalks of chopped celery and 3-4 chopped green onions (DO NOT use white onion, the taste is completely different and you and your guests will be very sorry...trust me). The resulting gumbo tastes like the real thing from New Orleans. I have made both shrimp gumbo and chicken/sausage gumbo, and both come out great with the few additions I've mentioned. Some people also add a few chopped okra, but not me.<br /><br />HINT (shrimp gumbo): Add cooked shrimp AFTER the gumbo has finished simmering and just before serving. It will taste much fresher.<br />HINT (chicken gumbo): Use a rotisseire chicken from the deli or cook the chicken during the day in a slow cooker while you're at work. Saves lots of time as well.<br /><br />I also like the "base" better than the "mix" since it allows you to add as much or as little rice as you like to the soup. Also, the "base" is better if you want to freeze it. I've found that one box usually feeds 4-5 people since they always go back for seconds.

The secret to good gumbo is the roux and with this product you have everything you need in one box.

review/text: My local supermarkets, where I shop, stopped selling the Gumbo Mix. The only place I could get it was at Costco in a variety pack. Although Zaterains other products are very good, I did not want to purchase the other items in the pack just to get one Gumbo Mix. I did a search, Where to get Zaterains Gumbo Mix and Amazon came up. I decided to opt for the 12 pack auto shipments. They are a bargain. I really like this with shrimp. I think you could add any meat and it would be good.

I was happy to buy a case of it when I found it on amazon.  I make a very large quantity every Christmas for family and friends. It freezes well, also.

review/summary: First class herb!
review/text: Growing up in Dalmatian region of Croatia I never appreciated this herb ........It was widely available, commonly growing wild, and it was an every day thing.....little did I now - nothing can compare to Dalmatian Sage. Something about Adriatic Sea mist, Dalmatian soil, sun.....sage is strong and aromatic. I use sage tea every day. It is bitter, but healing. For sore gums,dental problems, plugged up sinuses, cuts, abrasions, skin problems, stomach ulcer,...I'm sure there is many more medicinal uses for this sage. Maybe even culinary uses. If you google "Dalmatian Sage" you will get much better view of it. I'm glad somebody is marketing Dalmatian sage for USA consumers, and only reason I'm not giving 5 star on this review is  - shipping and packaging. My excitement of receiving my order turned to anger when I saw huge cardboard (10x12x12) box filled with packing peanuts to ship ONE pound of dry crushed herb safely packed in to mylar bag. What a waste! Shipping was pricey, but whole thing could be mailed in the envelope! What, they were afraid it might get crushed? I will order it again, when my supply gets low, no sage can compare to Dalmatian Sage.

I haven't found this product in the stores so I'm glad it's on Amazon.  I love cooking fast tasty meals that I can enjoy without a lot of work.  My garlic pepper grinder quickly became my #1 spice combo.  If you like garlic and pepper you won't be disappointed.  As a side note, I bought the garlic and salt version for a friend and she loved it just as much.  To be honest I would pay $15 a piece for one, it lasted forever, even using it all the time.  I literally have specks of spice left in the bottle and the soup I just made is still as delicious as if the jar were full.  Enjoy!

review/text: I picked this up at Target about a year ago and was really upset when I couldn't find it again.  It usually takes my household of 2 adults forever to use up spices but this is a generously sized container and still ran out fairly quickly.  It's the perfect blend of sea salt, pepper, and garlic without any of those flavors overpowering the others.  It makes a great coarse crust on steak and grilled chicken and tilapia and is amazing on oven fried potatoes and sweet potato fries.  I think my favorite meal to make with it is a scrambled egg brunch - thinly sliced browned potatoes, little ham chunks, sundried tomatoes, scramble some eggs over all of that and use Garlic Pepper heavily in the eggs, top with gooey mozzarella or goat cheese.  Delicious.<br /><br />I'm so happy I know I can get more.  It really is a staple in my house!

Both are advertised as being housed in nice Tin boxes, one of my reasons for purchasing these brands. I first received the Black box, dark roast ( came in a cardboard box, no Tin) I contacted Trade Concepts explaining one of my reasons for purchasing this was I wanted the coffee capsule to come in the tin box) They pretty much replied with, that's the way it goes, you get what you get, type of answer! Before I could repurchase the Red box-Medium roast(already on its way) from another seller, the second order arrived. Much to my disliking, this order of Medium roast came in a cardboard box as well, not the nice Tin box it is advertised as coming in! I thought giving Trade Concepts my business would work out as a good idea and relationship, thus ordering both Med & dark roasts from their company! I was wrong... I chose not to waste my time and be spoken down to, by contacting Trade Concepts again. Illy is a Good to Great product, but my purchases will go to another vendor next time, for Trade Concepts false advertised their  product and could care less about you as a customer!

review/summary: Would not brew in my senseo
review/text: I bought these specifically for my senseo coffee maker and they brewed water.  I generally love Illy espresso as it's one of the best espresso's carried in stores, but the single serving pods did not work and every time I tried to use them, they were wasted.  So I basically spent a good amount on money and never got an espresso.

review/summary: Expensive coffee, poor packing
review/text: Illy can be celebrated as the creator of coffee pods, the best way to get a decent espresso (but not a great espresso)without being a full fledge barista and a US$ 10.000 espresso machine.<br /><br />Illy are the most expensive pods, however they come in a metal can packed in bulk. Other coffee pods come individually packed in sealed bags with nitrogen atmosphere, but Illy packs them in bulk. Great first time you open the can, awful 5 days later.<br /><br />Bottom line: A coffee scam.<br /><br />Regards from sunny chilean summer.<br /><br />Eduardo Costoya

review/text: I am rather disappointed in Knorr's three new additions to the noodle line. I am a huge fan of Knorr and have been eating their noodles since I was a child. This one really is lacking in the flavor department. The bag advertises "lemon" flavor. As hard as I may try, I can not detect even a hint of lemon. Overall, these noodles are rather bland. I would stick to the other flavors in their Italian line which are much better (although somewhat hard to find).

review/summary: Excellence By Lindt
review/text: It is not a random thing Lindt is one of the finest chocolates in the world, after all Mr. Lindt and Mr. Sprungli practically invented the chocolate business. It's a real shame (because alcohol regulations by each U.S. State) these liquor filled bars are not available on your local grocery store and/or even with Lindt USA since they don't import'em. But now thanks to some importers we are able to enjoy'em. Please, pay attention, If you buy them, you really will enjoy'em. These liquor filled bars have the real liquor inside, they are not stuffed or truffled like some other good brands like Goldkenn which happen to have liquor truffled chocolates. With Lindt you will have the real deal inside and that is why these chocolates (according to my LindtUSA inquiry) won't be available anytime soon as a retail item since each State has their own regulation for liquor filled products, meaning that maybe the IRISH COFFEE (7% Alc) is OK in California but not in Philadelphia. All that being said, just buy them through these Amazon vendors and you will be golden. I placed my order and I received my bars in pristine order just after 5 days and just paying regular S&H. Again...you won't regret..!

review/summary: Measurements accurate
review/text: The bottles I recieved have very accurate water measurements. I used my digital scale and each ounce of water is exactly 30 grams as it should be. Not sure if something changed or other folks were mis-measuring their water. It is something you want to be careful of as the concentration of formula is important to baby's health.<br /><br />I will, however, agree that it can be a pain in the rear to get the formula in the top of these. It's not annoying enough to make me switch bottles, though.<br /><br />I've been using these for about a month now. I used the old ones (with BPA) for my daughter 4 years ago and had great luck with them. We're having good luck this time around as well. There's a lot of trial an error with baby bottles, but I also think that you really just have to pick one and stick to it because baby so quickly becomes used to one kind that if you switch it starts the problems all over again. These nipples have a really slow flow to begin with and get just a tiny bit faster over time. Other non "comfi" evenflo nipples will fit these bottles as well.<br /><br />I haven't had problems with any breaking, yet, but I will update this review if that starts happening. I don't sterilize them, I just hand wash them well in hot soapy water and let them dry completely on a first years drying rack & that works really well.

review/summary: our favorite so far
review/text: My son is 3 months old and has been formula fed since birth, so we have tried many bottles and nipples.  Thankfully, he is not picky and seems to adjust to all of the different samples.  I like these bottles best because they have the angled neck, which helps baby get less air, but they do not have all of the ridiculous extra parts of the Playtex ones (which also leaked incidentally).<br /><br />We have only used latex nipples, and I like these the best because they are very durable.  Sometimes my little guy gets so hungry and anxious that his sucking can collapse a nipple, but we have never once had that problem with these Evenflo nipples.  (However, the Evenflo glass nursers didn't have these great nipples.)<br /><br />I swore I would never use anything but glass bottles (for environmental reasons), but now I don't think we will use anything but the Evenflo Purely Comfi bottles!<br /><br />Try these bottles for 3 simple reasons:  (1) They aren't expensive.  (2) The angled neck is easy to hold.  (3) The nipples are well designed.

review/summary: The ONLY bottles that worked for my preemie twins!
review/text: We tried:<br /><br />1: soothie bottles (nipples were too hard and tired out the babies from sucking too hard)<br /><br />2: playtex ventaire bottles (nipples too soft/collapse inward and is hard to feed consistently as it keeps popping out of the babies mouth.<br /><br />3: These Evenflo standard size, 6oz, Purely comfi bottles and -- THANK GOD they work!<br /><br />The disposable nipples form the hospital fit on these bottles also, and they are very close to what they were fed in the NICU for those who have preemies like me. They also prevent colic as they are angled like the ventaire bottles. They are cheaper in cost too! The people who say they melt in the bottle warmers are wrong -- the key to heating them evenly is figuring out the perfect amount of water in the warmer and making sure to leave the cap/nipple on but unscrew it while heating!!! (Note to new mom's like me .4 oz of water in the bottle warmer will take 1.5 minutes (automatic) for a bottle with 2 oz of formula in it! The rest of the measurements are on the warmers, but none of the warmers have measurements for less than 5oz of formula in a bottle.<br /><br />Good luck!

review/summary: No issues here
review/text: I don't normally write reviews, but felt compelled to give another viewpoint based on the poor reviews of these bottles. I exclusively pump and measure my milk accurately. I have had absolutely no inaccuracies in measurement between my breast milk containers and these bottles (AND my breast milk collection bags), so I'd have to conclude that the measurement on the bottles is accurate. In addition, I've had absolutely no leaking (with the exception of once when the nipple was not placed in the cap correctly) and none have broken. I have 7 bottles in rotation that have been used for over 3 months, and again, no breakage. I would have to question how some of the bottles that have broken are cared for? They really should not be placed in the dishwasher....especially not on a heated dry cycle. I hand wash my bottles with a bottle brush and hot soapy water, then steam sterilize once a day. We are extremely happy with this product.

review/summary: Just don't.
review/text: I actually bought these at Tarjay, but these are basically the same thing.  Evenflo Comfi Angled-Neck bottles.  I liked them at first with the cool colors, angled neck and hand grippers on the side.  I have used them for about 4 months now. However, after 4 cracking and breaking in one week, I will be finding another brand.  It's not like myself, my son nor my daycare providers are overly-violent with these things, chucking them everywhere; just normal, everyday use.  The plastic seems to be more brittle than others, so after a little use (washing, feeding, storing, microwaving, dishwasher, etc) the bottom starts to splinter and eventually a big crack appears.  Is it due to the lack of BPA that compromises the structural integrity?  Not sure, but have heard others speculate.  I have picked up some Playtex Ventaires, and they seem to be made of a softer plastic, less brittle. Also when trying to wash these bottles, the teeny tiny divots in the bottom causes formula to accumulate in the divots (hard to clean) and the angled neck also is hard to reach and clean with a typical bottle brush.  In conclusion, just don't! Run away, run away, run away.

These narrow ones she latches to and doesn't refuse. But these newer bottles are nothing like the 05 bottles. They break easily and leak like a faucet. The bigger bottles have a wider opening than the little ones and mixing the nipples makes them leak. My baby dropped hers on the carpet and it shattered like glass. I miss the 05 bottles, wish I never got rid of them. But on a good note, I emailed evenflo and they sent me new ones in the mail, twice.

review/text: We've been using these bottles for a month.  I have no problems with them breaking or leaking, unless I put the nipple on wrong.  My only complaint is that the grips melted in our microwave steam bag.  I don't recall if the instructions specifically say not to use steam bags, so again, the problem might be my own fault and not that of the bottle or Evenflo.  I'd recommend them.  In fact I just told my husband that if we need more bottles we should just stick with these.  They're inexpensive, no stupid extra parts to wash or lose or melt in the dishwasher, and the replacement nipples are dirt cheap compared to our other bottles (Born Free and Dr. Browns).

I love the curved bottles and I seen these were 4 dollars cheaper than the ones I bought originally, and me being cheap, bought them. My son latches on to it very oddly, and his pacifier and other bottle nipples are different from each other so I know it's not because it's "different nipple". Also the cap does not screw on very tight. and when closing them with the cap on, you don't know if you screwed it on all the way as the cap keeps going. Will not be keeping these.

And of course, the angle reduced air intake so he wasnt as cranky.<br /><br />I was glad these dont have many parts, like most anti colic bottles, the nipple is a size which most babies can easily adapt to, and the comfy grip gives a good hold.<br /><br />Plus these arent as expensive as most bottles on the market.<br /><br />The only downside is that they arent wide at the neck, so getting formula in takes patience, but otherwise no issues!

review/summary: Love bottles but break often
review/text: I love these bottles. The only downside is that in the past 2 weeks, I've broken about 6 between me and her daycare. They don't do very well if your warming your bottle (I use premixed formula that stays in the fridge). They crack at the bottom ever so slightly that when I did put nursery water in them to go out my diaper bag got soaked and ruined her diapers. Katelyn was born with no sucking reflex and these bottle nipples helped her sooo much due to the wider base but not a breastfeeding nipple. I would recommend the nipples since the are super cheap ($1.25 ish at walmart) and put it in a thicker bottle that works. I use the bottles still, call it loyalty but just be forewarned, they don't last long and break. The funny thing is the green ones have never broke! Every single blue one has and I only have 1 purple remaining. I don't know what the difference is.....hope this helps. You get what you paid for and I bought super expensive bottles for my little girl, but nope...she likes these.

review/summary: Not durable!
review/text: We bought these bottles about 1month ago. Our daughter is very picky about bottles a chokes on many nipples. She is breastfed, but we needed to start introducing bottles for daycare. She did very well with these bottles.  In this month, 2 of the 3 rings that go on the bottom of the nipple have developed bubbles, making them useless. One bottle is on the verge of shattering and the other 2 have large cracks. These bottles are not durable at all. We hand wash these bottles, followed by a steam sterilizer.  She only gets one bottle a day, so we haven't used them very much. Don't buy. They are a waste of money.

review/summary: AWFUL bottles
review/text: I bought these for my second daughter because I was looking to replace our 5-year old Avent bottles with BPA-free.  I chose these because of the Evenflo name and the design/shape.  Horrible decision.  Every one of them has broken when dropped.  Not only did I spend money on buying these bottles in the first place, but now I have had to buy new Avent ones as well.  I am very disappointed in Evenflo, and will certainly not be too keen to buy anymore of their products.

review/summary: Love these bottles!!!
review/text: We got these bottles for my 7 month old daughter when she was about 3 months and we switched her from breast milk to formula. They have been wonderful, the angle is wonderful because it made get less air in her tummy, and I have found them to be quite durable.  We do wash them by hand though, so that might be the difference. We  also heat them in a cup of hot microwaved water for every feeding and we have never had any of our 9 break or crack.  The only thing that i don't really like is that the opening is a little on the small side, so it takes some practice to get the formula powder in without spilling, but over all i would highly reccomend these bottles.

review/summary: never had a problem - work great!
review/text: My daughter is now 7 months old, and we have been using these bottles pretty much since the day we brought her home from the hospital..  The only trouble they have given us is that they have a narrow "mouth" so it can be a pain to carefully scoop formula.  But we have not had to replace any bottles because of them wearing out - only to go up in size as she got older.  I love these and recommend them.  She can now hold them herself well too (supervised of course).<br /><br />I will note though - we dont heat her bottles - just room temperature water. She's always preferred that and makes life easier! Perhaps that makes a difference in the longevity?

review/summary: Used these for years
review/text: ok....I've used these bottles for 4 years, so I can't understand why some reviewers complain of them cracking. They do if you drop them....when they are full and heavy. I wash mine in the dishwasher.... That's my only complaint...the neck is narrow so I worry about it being completely clean. (btw I use bio kleen dishwashing detergent, supposedly safer). I always rinse again just in case.<br /><br />The outer colored plastic on the side of the bottle does melt when heated....but it doesn't leach into the inside because it's on the outside. I placed it in the microwave (not supposed to?) and that's why that plastic part melted.<br /><br />I don't use the silicone nipples that come with them. My little girls are picky, they only like the soft tannish ones that I have to special order.<br /><br />I no longer use these bottles though because I find the glass bottles (same maker) wash a lot cleaner in the dishwasher. Plus I can put them in the microwave w/no worries. My fears of the girls dropping the glass bottles are unfounded.

review/summary: Lower price but no bargain
review/text: I bought one set of these because we needed some extra bottles and the price was lower. I never have the energy to keep bottles clean at the same rate my daughter uses them. I usually use glass bottles but wanted to try a different style out. The glass bottles have proven to be a far better investment. By six weeks, one bottle had to be thrown out because it got a crack up the side. The remaining two will most likely not last much longer. They have micro cracks all over. All of my bottles are handwashed so heat is not the problem. They just seem to be made out of terrible plastic.<br /><br />As for design, my baby isn't picky about nipples or wanting bottles with fancy vents or straws. She eats the same no matter the shape of the bottle. However, I personally hated holding these. I didn't find them more comfortable to use or easier to keep milk in the nipple, which is supposedly the point of angled bottles. But that's a personal preference.<br /><br />It's definitely back to straight glass bottles for me, even if they are much heavier.

review/summary: difficult to clean
review/text: this is an amendment to an earlier review.<br />we have been using these bottles for a few weeks now and it's become clear that our bottle brush does not reach all around the bottom of the bottle.  i suppose i could stuff a rag down there and use a butter knife to try and clean it but i don't have time for that kind of thing.  our son has developed a preference for the nuby wide mouth bottle with handles and the vari-flow nipple (we were trying 4 different bottles as we moved up from 4 oz to 8 (or 10 or whatever) oz bottles) anyway, so we have ordered more of those and are not going to use these any longer.<br /><br />below is the original review.<br />we have been using these bottles for about a week now and are very pleased.  these bottles make it very easy to feed baby in a more upright position.  we have not had any problem with swallowing air or with nipple collapse.  i find the indentations on the side really do make it easier and more comfortable for me to hold the bottle.  i like that this bottle does not have any extra parts to wash, unlike some other bottles designed to reduce air ingestion.  my baby (five months old, using bottles for 3 months now) has not had problems adjusting to any nipple we've tried and he took to this nipple with no problem.  we did order more nipples in the medium flow rate, as these come with a slow flow nipple and our baby is starting to get frustrated with those.  i love that they are bpa free.  i was a little concerned they may be difficult to clean, but they are not.  likewise, it is not harder to put the formula in them; just turn the bottle so the opening is facing your hand.  i give these 4 stars and not five mostly because they do not have handles.  my baby really wants to hold his own bottle (some of the time) and these bottles are too big for him; he just can't wield them.  we have other bottles that do have handles and he just loves that.  also, while i have no problems with the bottle itself leaking (just be sure not to screw nipple on too tightly or loosely), the nipple (the medium flow more so) does drip when bottle is held upside down or on it's side.  on that note, the lids do not touch the nipples when on; so if you shake your formula in the bottle you do have to touch nipple with your fingers.  all in all this product was just what it said it would be and we are very happy with it.

review/summary: Will buy these from now on.
review/text: My mom bought these to use at her house for my son while I opted to buy the ventaire by Playtex.  Guess mom knew best.  The bottles I bought leaked and the numbers came off some of the bottles.  I ended up stealing all her Evenflo bottles and buying more of our own.<br /><br />The nipples don't leak, the bottles last, I will buy them for future children.<br /><br />The only problem I have had with them is my fiance busted/cracked a bottle while shaking it up for my son once.  He says he squeezed it too hard and it cracked.  However, I'm certain that could happen with any bottle... and I'd much rather have to clean that mess once in 6 months than clean tons and tons of sheets, outfits, and furniture every week that have leaked milk everywhere.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

review/summary: I love these bottles!
review/text: I went through every single bottle at my local department store.  Most of the bottles leaked or the nipple flow would be to slow or to fast.  These bottles were perfect!  The nipples these bottles use are wonderful.  They have a pressure system, so the flow is exactly what the baby needs. The only thing I would warn about these bottles are the lids don't snap on well and the colored side peices will get soft and even melt if left in a warmer to long. Those issues weren't significant enough for me to stop using them, and I still feel they are the best bottles out of all of the other ones I've tried.

The last bottle that broke fell literally one foot off of a small chair and cracked up the side.  Don't waste your money on these bottles because they will not last.

review/text: I tried every bottle out there! Expensive, not expensive...with bags, without...This is the bottle that my son could actually drink out of. He has used them since he was a week old, he is now 11 months. This is the only bottle that didn't leak. There isn't multiple pieces, or certain ways to put it together so it would work. So night time feedings were quick. With the bottle at a slant, it helped with the air bubbles.<br /><br />I did not give it 5 stars though, because it is a bit of a pain to clean. But it is still a great bottle!!

review/text: These bottles are really quite bad. Maybe if you started your baby on them and she/he was used to them from the begining... but the nipples are too hard. There is no venting so LOTS of bubbles form. Baby has to stop drinking to relieve pressure. I'm sticking with Dr. Browns bottles... they do have a lot of parts - but they are by far the best ones I've tried.

review/text: We got these when we were switching from nursing to formula.  I liked the angled aspect among other things.  Well...I am not satisfied with these at all!  They leak 90% of the time and it is just a pain!  I found a "way/method" of screwing the tops on so that they don't leak too bad, but overall they are just a pain and even with my "way/method" they still leak very often.  I am having a really hard time understanding how other parents rated these bottles a 5.  Seriously?  I will not waste ten dollars on fancy bottles again.  We have had the best luck (ie-no leaks) with Wal-Marts Parent's Choice bottles and they only cost 97 cents a piece.

review/summary: I love these bottles
review/text: When I decided to formula-feed my third son I went to the store and picked out a few different types of bottles to try.  He had been breastfed for a couple of weeks and had no problem switching between breast and bottle, no matter which bottle we used.  I decided to purchase more of the Purely Comfi bottles because the nipple flow isn't too fast (unlike the others we tried).  It doesn't hurt that I think they are best looking bottles, too.  I haven't had a problem with them leaking or breaking.  The only issue I have is they are harder to clean because they are thin and a bottle brush doesn't easily fit.  So far, I'm glad I chose these bottles.

review/summary: Didn't like these at all
review/text: I hardly ever write negative reviews, but I hope to save someone else the time and money I wasted on these bottles. I read the mediocre reviews on the Purely Comfi bottles. Nevertheless, I purchased them in hopes that my daughter would latch on and that the negative reviews were a result of others' being picky. I began with the Playtex nurser systems, because I thought they would be easiest with expressed breast milk, but my daughter would not latch on to the widemouth nipples after using small ones in the hospital.<br /><br />We used the 6 ounce size and had 6 bottles. I love the colors of the Comfi bottles, and I like the shape and size. The nipples are pretty good too; my daughter did well with them. However, there are some issues. Some of mine leak around the nipple, and others leak around the screw cap. Not only is it difficult to keep my daughter from getting wet, my precious breast milk is being "fed" to her outfit or bib! One of the most inconvenient things about the bottles: the nipple ring does not screw onto the bottle well. It's like there isn't enough thread on the bottle. More than a few times, I have pulled off the nipple cover only to see that the entire screw top and nipple came with it! Now I have to be very careful when removing the nipple cover. Then, after using the bottles for a while, I couldn't even get the tops to screw on at all. Two of my nipple covers have broken and can no longer be used. I don't even know how they broke. They haven't been subjected to any harsh conditions! The bottles also pour miserably. If I need an extra ounce from a bottle in the fridge, I cannot pour from one bottle to another without wasting milk and getting it all over the counter.<br />In summary, I would not buy these again. In Evenflo's defense, I contacted them, and they sent me more bottles, but they were no better. The customer service person was nice though. I regret buying these, because we had to buy all new bottles, which resulting in a few days if irritable feedings as my daughter has to get accustomed to a new nipple. I wish I had just bought the more expensive Dr. Brown's bottles from the beginning.

review/text: I bought these bottles because I liked the angled look and the afforable price. After using them a few times for my two month old, I can honestly say I strongly dislike them. I only recommend these if you want to see and hear air while your baby is sucking. The nipples are SO slow!! It takes my son almost 30 minutes to finish 4.5 ounces! Using Dr. Brown's bottles, it only takes about half that time. The Evenflo bottles also tend to leak, even with the nipple secured tightly. Save your money for something better.

review/summary: Disappointed...they leak!!!
review/text: Bought two packs of these bottles a few months ago at Sears. Was interested in a bottle with an angled neck to ensure baby wasn't sucking air; and one that was BPA free. Baby just started drinking about 4 ounces per serving so I just started using these bottles a few days ago only to discover a) the caps protecting the nipple don't stay on securely b)milk leaks out at the neck of the bottle and can be the cause of unexpected outfit changes. These 2 areas need improvement!!! Apart from that the bottles are cute and attempt to offer good features but miss the mark on the basics. I am now on the hunt for new bottles and would not recommend this product.

review/summary: these bottles SUCK
review/text: Can you say cheap? We had a 3 pack of these. The first one mysteriously got a crack along the bottom of it, and I caught it in time to transfer the formula that was in it into a different bottle and just toss it. The 2nd one shattered into oblivion while in our diaper bag at a friend's house, getting all over everything in the diaper bag, on our friend's wood floor and couch. I went home after that and inspected the 3rd one and saw tiny hairline cracks all over the bottom of it, like it could give way at any minute, so I just tossed it. Not worth it. The nipples on these were awesome for the first month of my son's life because they were really tiny for his tiny little mouth, so I guess they worked ok for the first part of their life, but they aren't worth buying over all the other bottles out there. If you get these as a gift, donate them. Don't buy them.

review/summary: These are the best Kisses yet!
review/text: A friend bought these last year and shared them with me.  They were so good, I immediately went to the same store to buy some more and they were already out of them.  I have searched everywhere for these pumpkin spice Kisses and could not find them.  I even called Hershey's but they couldn't help me either.  I finally found them here at Amazon (yea Amazon).  If you like pumpkin, these Kisses rock!  I highly recommend them.  Only problem you'll have is portion control.

review/summary: Delish!
review/text: These are a little piece of heaven! I think it's white chocolate with pumpkin flavoring? Also a hint of nutmeg maybe? Either way, they are simply divine.

review/summary: Not good, not bad.
review/text: I can't just unwrap and pop them in my mouth like I can the other Kisses. These guys are just okay. I find they are much better for cooking with rather than eating. Try Chai Pumpkin Spice thumbprint cookies.

review/summary: Meh...tasted awfully chemically.
review/text: This is a quote from my wife, who is the candy freak in our house:  "I was totally bummed.  I love pumpkin too.  This was just too much of a fake pumpkin flavor with subtle undertones of, oh, I dunno, some sort of a plastic taste.  I would have liked to have had some chocolate flavor in there to maybe tone it down a bit or something.  Thumbs down from this lover of all things confectionary, but still glad I tried them because I'm always in search of a winner.  Definitely don't take my word for it though.  Just try them.  You may love them."

review/summary: Kisses that just are not
review/text: These kisses are just OK. They sort of taste like pumpkin but not very good pumpkin, and they lack a critical flavor - Hershey's chocolate.

review/text: These would be good to use in something that you were baking but to eat them alone they are not good.  A little too overwhelming on the spice flavor.

review/text: I really like these.  The flavoring is not over-powering but noticeable.  The texture is very creamy.  Interesting that they do it in multiple layers.

review/summary: Not Pumpkin
review/text: I bought a package of these because I love pumpkin....had to throw the package away as no one would eat them! Doesn't even come close to pumpkin-flavored. We'll stick to chocolate kisses from now on!
