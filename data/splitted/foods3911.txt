review/summary: Similar flavor to tap water, but a very unique perceived texture.
review/text: This water tastes very similar to tap water or cheap bottled water, but definitely has a different texture when you drink it.  The taste is clean and crisp, but without the flavor of more expensive bottled waters that have minerals added for flavor.  It tastes very similar to Aquafina or Nestle bottled water.<br /><br />The big difference is in the perceived texture of the water as you drink it.  It has a smooth almost saline-like texture that is enjoyable when cold.  It tastes almost salty when warm.<br /><br />I probably won't go out of my way to get this water again, but if I saw it in a display case at a store, I would drink it again just for the variety of it.  I recommend that you try it, to see what I mean, but am not confident that you will be hooked (I wasn't).

review/summary: It tastes... like nothing.  Refreshing to drink after a 5 mile walk.
review/text: The bottle I received was a 1.5 liter size.  Very large (I have a photo at the top).  I usually get more manageable sizes to take with me when I walk/jog - a size that fits in the cup holder of my stroller.  Anyway I thought I'd give this a shot today since I was going for a longer jaunt, a 5 mile combined jog / walk with my stroller and perhaps I'd want more than just one small water bottle.<br /><br />The bottle size actually made it so I drank less because I had to store it in the bottom of the stroller and it wasn't readily available... so I only drank half of it and that was consumed at the end of my outing.  But I sort of felt more energized after drinking it - and I was quite pooped after 5 miles of pushing the stroller.  I don't know if that was psychological because I knew there were electrolytes in it or if there really was more of a boost.<br /><br />I can't comment too much on if the pH is of any benefit or not, I understand you have to drink this for awhile before any benefit kicks in... HOWEVER I did a quick search online to see if I could read anything from an independent source telling me why 9.5 pH or a higher pH in general is good for you and I couldn't find anything EXCEPT websites that were trying to sell me their products.  I couldn't find a website to tell me WHY this was good that WASN'T trying to sell me anything and that had some credibility.  So please keep that in mind.  One of the websites that was trying to sell me their pH stuff sited some "Japanese study" but gave no specifics... so I could not even look that study up to verify anything.  So it sort of leaves me to believe the pH thing may be a fad.  Probably a harmless one though.<br /><br />Bottom line... water tasted good.  I like the electrolyte thing.  Don't care much about the pH, think that may be silly.

review/summary: If you like tap water..
review/text: I usually drink spring water. This one taste like a tap water and I could only drink it when very chilled. The warmer it got the worse it tasted. It is basically tap water purified with added minerals.<br />Due to high ph number it taste very smooth, heavy and thick. It didin't feel refreshing to me at all. It's not the worse I've tried, it beats for instance Las Vegas tap water;)<br /><br />It will be good for someone who prefers this type of water. I don't so this is why only 2 stars.

review/summary: Good cold. Dubious marketing claims
review/text: This is marketed the same way that toothpaste is ("doctor recommended"), which for me, has the opposite effect on credibility. Strangely, this product does not have the usual FDA disclaimer that I've seen on other products ("This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA").<br /><br />Evaluating this water just as a water, apart from the numerous health benefit claims, it's good. When at room temperature, the taste is a bit strange and off-putting. When refrigerated and served cold, it is very refreshing and clean tasting. Not sure what "Best available pH at 9.5" means.. This statement does not make sense. pH is a measurement of acidity or alkalinity, on a scale of 0-14 (0 being a strong acid, 14 being a strong base). Normal water is neutral at 7. "Hydrates better" than what? What are we comparing this to? Hydrates better than an English muffin? Yes, it certainly does!<br /><br />Most of the other sales bullet points are standard and hardly worth mentioning.. Plastic is type 1 PETE and can be easily recycled, but most beverage bottles are made of #1 or #2. I'm not a fan of bottling water and the claims of reducing carbon footprint are bogus. These bottles have to be shipped across the country, using trucks and airplanes, which is not carbon neutral. It is far more environmentally friendly to get a filter/treatment system and drink your local water supply.

review/text: I don't think there's a lot you can say about this product.  It's bottled water.  It's not even sparkling or flavored with anything.  But as far as bottled water goes, this is good.  It's a lot better than the cheap store brands, which usually taste like tap water.  It's better than some of the cheaper retail brands like Dasani too.  Whether it stacks up against the really high end brands I have no idea since I don't drink those.  Anyway, since it is pretty much just regular water I wouldn't see any point paying any excessive price for it, but it is good.<br /><br />That is all.

review/summary: Great Hydration!
review/text: I'm not an athlete.  I've read through the reviews of this from the athletes, and if I were an athlete it would probably be a big deal in my mind.  On the other hand, I'm like everyone and get sick from time to time.  From being ill, I was dehydrated.  My doctor immediately told me to start drinking Gatorade or PediaSure.  I have never liked flavored sports drinks.  I hate the fact that when I am already not feeling well, I have to drink something I can't stand the flavor of.  I had previous tried SmartWater to solve this issue, but it doesn't seem to be infused with enough electrolytes to help.  So, this time I tried Essentia.  After about 2 liters, I did feel better.  You know that sorta dry, swollen tongue thing that happens when you are dehydrated?  That went away.  I felt a little stronger between drinking this and taking my medicine.  I asked the doctor if this was okay to drink instead of Gatorade and he gave me the go ahead.  So, here is what I liked:<br /><br />1.  It pretty much tastes like water.  There is a slight difference in taste from something like Brita water, or most bottled water, but overall it's not a taste that drives me away.<br /><br />2.  It is not sugary!  This is what drives me away from Gatorade.  I hate the sugary taste of every one of their flavors.  Since this basically tastes like water, it is not sugary!  This is the aspect that makes me dance for joy.<br /><br />3.  It made me feel hydrated after a bottle.  Honestly, it was probably less than a bottle.  If I wasn't already extremely dehydrated, it would have been even less than that.  I love it when something makes you just feel better.<br /><br />4.  It is a sporty water bottle that is made from environmentally safe products.  I'm not a total Go Green girl, but it is definitely a plus and something I am becoming more aware of.  I know that several of my high school athletes are very big in the Green shopping, so this is something I would recommend it.  It's also good plastic that is easily recycled again.<br /><br />The biggest con is the price.  It's not unheard of for a 12 pack of water to be expensive, but it is definitely not a drink the average family would be able to purchase several times a week.  A single bottle is just slightly more expensive than Gatorade, but a 12 pack for about $25 is much different than the supermarket brand of water that is a 24 pack for $4.00.  This is water that is for the electrolytes and rehydrating after a sickness or big work out, not an every day drinking water.

review/summary: There is a Difference
review/text: I was skeptical about this product. I sometimes drink bottled water, but usually it's for the convenience more than anything else.<br /><br />I tried this product after refrigerating it for several hours. The texture is different. It's a slight difference, but I agree that it could be described as silky. The best feature, however, is the taste. It is clean and fresh. In fact, it is different enough from regular water (from the tap or bottled water) that I would consider serving it as a special beverage with a meal.<br /><br />It is expensive, but for those who want the best-tasting water and can afford the luxury, this is an excellent choice.

review/text: My comparison point is good old tap water run through a generic "brita" filter, cold.<br /><br />The strength of this water is that it tastes almost as good.  The tiniest bit plasticy in the back of the pallet, but not so much unless you're looking for it.  I don't know what to say about the electrolytes and the pH level - seems a little gimmicky, but if it's your thing, then this is a good tasting vessel for its consumption.<br /><br />The bottle is the thin, very collapsible kind.

review/text: Although this water does not have the full bodied flavor of a great spring or mountain water, Essentia's does have a silky smooth taste on the palate.  Essentia's pH is a very alkaline 9.5, and the product is electrolyte infused and purified by reverse osmosis.  Fortunately, Essentia is also sugar free, unlike a lot of sports drinks. If I worked out a lot, I would go for Essentia over a sugary sports drink.

review/summary: Great Tasting Water.
review/text: I live in an area where the tap water does not taste so great. Bottled water is a treat for me and I have tried a few different brands. Essentia is one of the best I have tried.<br /><br />I usually drink bottled water that is listed as "spring water." This is the first time I have tried purified water with added electrolytes. I don't taste mineral or other flavors, I only taste great tasting water. This water tastes sweet and fresh. By sweet I don't mean sweet in a sugary sense but sweet in fresh and pure sense.<br /><br />I don't care about how a water is made and will not buy water because of things added to it like electrolytes. I care about taste.  This tastes great.

review/summary: Refreshing....tastes like water should
review/text: I drink a lot of water, but I rarely purchase bottled water. We've been using  the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W9Q0GC">New Wave Enviro Premium 10 Stage Water Filter System</a> for a year now.  Essentia 9.5 pH drinking water has no taste & is very good. Taste wise Essentia 9.5 pH compares to the water I get from my faucet using the New Wave Enviro filter. However, Essentia is enhanced with pure minerals & promotes its 9.5 pH alkalinity.<br /><br />I don't know if there have been any scientific studies on the benefits of drinking alkaline water.  My internet search was inconclusive.<br /><br />If you are looking for an alkaline bottled water with a pH of 9.5, Essentia won't disappoint you.

review/summary: First I was thirsty, then I was not.
review/text: For most bottled waters, there are basically two elements that are required for quality.  First, does it quench the thirst?  Yes, of course it does, it's water.  Second, does it taste good?  Again, yes, it does.<br /><br />However, there are more benefits to this pH drinking water, apparently, than the standard water.  According to its product description: "Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive. Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance. It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more."<br /><br />Do any of these claims come true?  It's hard to tell, but I know it didn't make me feel any LESS healthy.

review/text: So I had the chance to try this water out, and I have to admit it seems like if there was going to be a health benefit you would need to drink it often. I received one bottle and I had some of it. The water tastes like purified water. Theres no weird chemical flavors  or plastic flavors. There is no odor and it tastes clean. It reminds me a lot of Smart Water.<br /><br />I can't confirm if there are positive health impacts, I haven't had enough to show that I'm sure. But I can confirm it tastes just like water and if you are looking for something with a pH level of 9.5 this appears to be it...<br /><br />Is it a buy/try or don't buy? I'd say you can give it a try.

review/text: I received one bottle of this water to review. It tastes just fine, not a lot of flavor from the added minerals in the bottle. This seems to be some preliminary attempt at the alkaline bottled water market. The label indicates "pH is 9.5 +/- (purified waters require calibrated pH meter for testing)" which implies to me that they don't yet have a calibrated meter... Anyhow, the health benefits, if any, of the water are hard to assess. Most mineral waters have more flavor and are also going to be moderately alkaline.

review/summary: Water with benefits and no funny aftertaste
review/text: My job has me running around on my feet for 8 hours a day so it's important that I stay hydrated.  Lately I have been drinking whatever I bring from home (usually something similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026I0O14">Propel Fitness Water</a>) or just water from the dispenser.  The thing I've noticed with the sports drinks are that they actually leave me thirstier and water usually leaves me full once I'm able to drink enough to quench my thirst.<br /><br />I did read some of the reviews before deciding to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HG9ET0">Essentia 9.5 pH</a> and based on them being mostly positive I wanted to give it a try. The bottle I received lasted me the entire day at work and I didn't have to go searching for more which was nice. The taste was much better than tap and even better than the bottled dispenser water we have.  As for the claims of "helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more" I can't really prove or disprove them after just one bottle. The only thing I can say is that I did feel like it quenched my thirst better than anything I've been drinking. Is it all in my imagination? I don't think so, which is why I've actually purchased more from my local grocery store (the price was just a bit better than here on Amazon).

review/summary: Very tasty water
review/text: I have taste electrolite infused water once before and I loved it. I have no idea what the brand name was. This tasted the same. It literally makes me want to drink more. I have been scared off from drinking tap water as I have some auto-immune diseases and now qualfy as "older" (I hate that tag, elderly).<br /><br />We periodically receive reports from the city about what they find in our water. It says in the report that we should stop buying water. But it also has the warning about if you have an weakened immune system, are elderly, undergoing treatment involving steriods that you may be more vulnerable to certain protoza. Cryptosporidium is one that they warn against. It has been shown to be absent for several years and a person who has a weakened immune system should recover in two weeks. But the report also says the reason that the water doesn't taste well and look OK is because of algal bloom. Algal bloom can be bad for dogs and lambs so should I still drink it? I don't trust it so I don't.<br /><br /> When I tasted this water, it tasted so much better. All I can go by is taste. It tastes clean.<br /><br />I docked the rating by one star because of the cost. I still don't think I could afford it. I tried filters for a while but the filters were so expensive. If I could afford it I would definitely sign up for the subscribe and save.<br /><br />At least until it is gone, I can enjoy the water so clean tasting that I want to drink more.<br /><br />I highly recommend this water, it is so good that it is a treat to drink.

review/text: There is not much to say about water, I enjoy bottled water and always buy the packs of Dasani Bottled water from the local store.  I saw this item and thought it would be nice to give something else a try.  I poured me a glass of this water (I have had it chilling in the fridge for the day), and tried it, it tasted OK, and the water appeared beyond clear (kind of strange how clear the water was), it did have a small flavor or something, but I was not sure.  After I finished the glass I could still taste something in my mouth, it had an almost bitter flavor.  I got some tap water and washed my mouth out and that got rid of that bitterness.<br /><br />I am not sure what I am tasting in this water, but whatever it is, I do not care for it.  The bitterness is something I have tasted before, but cannot remember.  I think I will stick with Dasani or tap water.  This may just be my tastebuds and you may not have a problem with this water, but I could taste something and I did not like it.

review/summary: Hey, it's H20 with a twist
review/text: Water with a Ph of 9.5 is thought to help with many physical ailments (Google it) as well as hydrate better, especially after strenuous activity. I've never seen much of a difference using sports drinks vs cold water, but many people do. This drink would be a much cheaper alternative to those $1 and $2 sports drinks. It does have a different "texture" than regular water, perhaps because of the Ph level.<br /><br />There is no source specified, so I assume it's from tap water.  The source does not really matter to me. Many of the springs in this country are becoming contaminated, and those that draw water from "mountain streams" - eeewww!  Animals and people use those as a bathroom, and things die and rot there.  The bottom line is that ALL water get filtered thoroughly, no matter the source, and it all starts in the same place.  That's personal preference, but I'm not paying a premium for "spring" water that's going to be filtered anyway!

review/summary: Tastes like water. HUGE bottle!
review/text: I'm basing my review on this being what it says it is. It's water! Yep! It sure is, and that is exactly what it tastes like.  Read on :)  It's got electrolytes! YES! I am going to have to believe that because as I said, it tastes like water. I love the idea of electrolytes in anything and if you do too, then this is for you. Rather than feeling like you always have to grab a bottle of Gatorade (which is sugary, flavored, chemical-ish tasting) you can grab WATER! Perfect for after workouts, at work, any time!<br /><br />If you read the ingredients (purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride) you might wonder what all of that is doing in there. I do. But I'm not a scientist and not sure what makes up electrolytes. It has zero calories, fat, sodium (with sodium bicarbonate in it?) zero carbs, zero protein. So I'm going by what the bottle says, it's electrolyte water. Yeah!<br /><br />It's a huge bottle, one I plan to recycle by filling with water from my fridge! Which brings me to the other claim on the bottle. It says 'For a difference you can taste." Well, to me, this tastes like my fridge water. No better, no worse, no different. I had actually considered taking off one star for this, but then I recalled my high school health class that said 'you can interpret sales/marketing one way "This is the best toothpaste ever!" or another. Who is to say what it's the BEST of? WHO says? Etc. So I can't taste any difference from my fridge water, like I can with my favorite waters <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013T5YO4">FIJI Natural Artesian Water, 50.7 -Fl.  Oz  Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S891KU">NEO Water - 9.5pH Alkaline, Electrolyte, Antioxidant Water 20 OZ (24 Case) - Alkaline Water - Electrolyte Water - Antioxidant Water - PH Water - BPA Free Plastic</a> but who is to say that's bad? But aha! It says on the bottle it has a 'silky smooth taste' Well, in my opinion, the Fiji water really, really does! This doesn't at all, but that could just be my opinion of what silky smooth water should be.<br /><br />SO if you love water, and want something added to it that will help you refresh, refuel, get better etc...and want it to just taste like water...then this is totally for you. At 50.7 fluid ounces, and with a nice sturdy bottle, you won't be disappointed.

I think the bottle says something like 50 ounces.<br /><br />In any case, this water has a very clean, refreshing taste. It is purified water with electrolytes, which to me I would prefer my water to be like this, than electrolytes like they have in Gatorade.<br /><br />If I were to drink bottled water I would drink this water, because of the electrolytes, so that you don't get dehydrated.

review/summary: Water-flavoured alkaline electrolyte beverage.
review/text: Essentia is water with electrolytes and a pH of 9.5. It is basically an alkaline unflavoured sports drink.  Essentia tastes just like regular water; it's not soapy, nor metallic tasting like some would suspect looking at the 9.5 pH label.<br /><br />The whole alkaline water discussion falls into 2 camps that is really beyond the scope of this review.  To summarize, one camp believes it helps against cancer, and promotes longevity etc by following an alkaline diet, the other is calling BS on the psuedoscience of creating "pure" alkaline water through osmosis and ionizing water. There is also a large number of middle-of-the-road people that are just using it for convenience to help with GERD instead of popping a pepcid or carrying around a box of bicarb.<br /><br />One important note is that this water is sourced from many sources (including municipal) and is treated water, which does rank lower than water sourced from a natural untreated and untampered spring.  However, Essentia does taste good and whatever other people's stance is on the alkaline water/diet issue, it can't hurt to just drink more water.<br /><br />I love water. It is my favourite drink and would not hesitate to buy this brand of water if given the choice alongside other altered/treated waters in the same price range.

review/summary: Water, Water Everywhere
review/text: 'A Difference You Can Taste' is the slogan for this water. It boasts that it has a ph factor of 9.5 and claims that it hydrates. Under normal circumstances I drink bottled water because the tap water here is not especially palatable since it is well water.  My bottled water of choice is normally whatever is on sale and I usually am of the opinion that the brands don't vary much. If it doesn't have a taste all the better<br />The good news is that Essentia doesn't have a taste per se. It is fresh tasting and does not have a funky or mineral aftertaste. To me it is a pricey version of what I normally drink. Does it hydrate or contain electrolytes? I have absolutely no idea.<br />My son swears by Essentia however and buys large amounts of it at Whole Foods. He has terrible acid reflux  and claims it is way better than Gatorade and far more satisfying and has even reduced his acid reflux issues.<br />Since I am not a runner and I don't like Gatorade, I'm sticking with plain old bottled water.

review/summary: Wish-washy about this water
review/text: The product tastes great.  It tastes like higher end bottled water.  One reviewer called the taste "silky" and I can't think of a better description for it.  It goes down smooth, that's for sure.<br /><br />I'm unsure about certain aspects of this water.  On the one hand, I wish I would have had some during the times my youngest suffered from acid reflux or when anyone in the household suffered from an upset stomach.  On the other, I'm concerned that drinking too much of it will cause an imbalance with stomach acids, causing further digestion problems.<br /><br />I do think this is an excellent product overall for those who need it. For me, I'm probably going to keep a bottle or two on hand for upset stomachs.  I don't think I will be drinking it daily or replacing my current water-of-choice with it.

review/text: So I didn't know what to expect when trying this product...  I suppose I thought I'd detect a slightly off or metallic taste, with all the electrolytes added, but I did not.<br /><br />Though the product advertises itself as "silky smooth" I don't think I'd describe it that way.  It tasted fine, but not "better" than water, and not any worse.<br /><br />If you really are struggling to find water that has some of these characteristics, then I'd give it a try.  Me, I'm going to stick with filtered water, because I really couldn't tell the difference.

review/summary: Thrist Quenching
review/text: I am in love with Essentia! This water tastes very smooth, and keeps me hydrated for a very long time. Living in a hot and humid environment, I need all the hydration I can get, and Essentia didn't let me down. I felt the effects within an hour-hydration anyway. I don't have any real health problems, and the idea that just water can cure health problems seems a bit much, and none of these claims have been proven. However, for a bottled water, I very much enjoyed this.<br /><br />While I should say the texture is smooth, and not thick, there is no odd aftertaste that most bottled waters give you. It tastes as I imagine pure drinking water should. This leaves behind no odd coating of the tongue that annoys me in most bottled waters, and it goes down very well. My mouth even feels more refreshed after drinking it!<br /><br />The price isn't too bad for what you get either. The bottles are insanely huge for a typical bottled water.<br /><br />I plan on buying more of this water, as it was even better, to me, than Smart Water, and I used to swear by them!

review/summary: wonderful - UPDATE
review/text: This water was bottled at 9.5 and although by the time it reaches us its probably closer to 8.5, that is still excellent. My body absorbs this water much better than any other, I drink just as much but urinate half as much as before. I use it in my soups, coffee, etc. This water and replacing standard refined table salt with pink himalayan salt in my diet has increased my energy 10-fold. This may not be the magic bean for everyone's body, but I love it. Tastes silky smooth too.<br /><br />**UPDATE Sept 2012** - I ordered 3 types of bottled high-ph water: NeoWater, AlkaPure, and Essentia, then tested them with PH testing strips. The Essentia water tested at 9.0, the AlkaPure at 9.3, and the NeoWater at 7.1! Thanks, Essentia, for ensuring the quality of your water. I remain a happy customer :) I'll try to post the picture of the tests to the product page.

With just one bottle, there isn't a way for us to tell if this water would make a differnce say after 1 week, month, year. At this point, we don't think it's worth the extra money to give it a try for that long.

review/summary: Tasty Water
review/text: So I usually drink Arrowhead water, but thought I would try this since drink more ph balanced water is supposed to be good for your health.  The taste was not too far off from my Arrowhead water...the difference I would say is the electrolytes which can have a minor taste.  Overall, was happy with the taste and it did seem to "quench my thirst" better.  I only had one bottle to try, so I can't attest to any health benefits, but I would definitely drink it again.

review/summary: Slight unpleasant chemical aftertaste
review/text: In the old days, water was water. Now days, consumers have their choice of bottled or tap, sparkling or flat, distilled or spring, and a hundred other options too complex for most to care about. In this case, Essentia is marketed as pH balanced at 9.5, meaning it is significantly alkaline (basic in the old parlance - the opposite of acidic) compared to traditional water, which falls roughly around 7 pH (give or take). Various websites will extol the virtues of this sort of waters, while others call it bunk. To me, however, all that matters is the flavor.<br /><br />Essentia water lives up to its label - it does have a silky smooth taste (or lack thereof). The problem is, it also has a slight chemical aftertaste that is most likely due to the added sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride. I also experienced a mild dry mouth after drinking it which I attribute to drinking an alkaline substance in a mouth that generally runs either very slightly acidic or very slightly basic. These aspects are enough for me not to drink it anymore, though I have had significantly worse-tasting water.<br /><br />Rating: 2 out of 5 stars. The mild chemical aftertaste is too much for me, but it still tastes better than Dasani.

review/summary: tastefully different
review/text: I'm not quite sure how to explain this, because it is water...but there is a kind of a different "taste" to it, and also a different texture as well. I've not really known much about the pH of water, what should or shouldn't be desired, but somehow, this water was just....different, in the best sort of way. If they sold this everywhere, I'd definitely buy it. It is more than worth "investing" in, AND you get quite a bit of water. The one bottle I received to try it out lasted me quite a while, for it being a water bottle.<br /><br />In addition to a difference in "taste" and texture - I know that sounds weird, but you'd have to drink it to get what I mean....and not just chug it, but to really enjoy the water as you slowly consume it - I honestly feel it better hydrates and keeps the body hydrated. I've not experimented yet, but I could tell that (as active as I was while consuming most of this water,) I felt hydrated faster and longer, longer both during the physical activity and afterwards, too. It seemed to replenish (during and after) what I was losing/what I had lost in the end. I felt satisfied. The water almost had the same kind of feel that drinking other kinds of vitamin waters with electrolytes have on my body. Granted, I wouldn't TOTALLY replace those electrolytes with this water, but it seemingly had the same/similar kind of feel/affect on me.<br /><br />I enjoy(ed) it and would most definitely recommend someone looking into this and trying it out!

review/summary: Tasted nice and seems to hydrate well
review/text: Now I know that you can't guarantee how much electrolytes are in a product for certain without taking it to a lab and testing it. Since this was one of my main reasons for sampling this, this was the main thing I tested for in my daily routine.<br /><br />Taste-wise, this is good. It tastes like water and is better than the city water I get from my tap. However I do want to state that I can get similar tastes from other bottled waters on the market. This actually didn't impress me that overly much because for the most part you can get ultra-filtrated fancy water from many different sources. You need a little something extra to really stand out.<br /><br />That's where the electrolytes come in. To really test this I drank portions of this at the gym while I was doing my cardio, as good hydration can often make for a better workout. The water was pretty refreshing and it felt like it made a difference from the water I usually get from the water fountain by the changing rooms. It just didn't seem to make such an overwhelming difference that I'd rush out the door to buy another bottle as soon as I emptied this one.<br /><br />Would I buy this on my own? Under certain circumstances, yes. It's not a "must buy", but if I was sick and needed to rehydrate, I'd get this as an alternative to straight electrolytes. I'd also get it if I was in a store, was thirsty, and this was available. It's good enough that I'd buy it again for the most part. I just wouldn't write home about it.

review/summary: Pleasant tasting Water Free of BPA and Chlorine
review/text: I was attracted by the claims that water is highly purified, has no chlorine or fluoride, and contains electrolytes. I found the taste to be pleasant and comparable to distilled water, which I usually purchase in 3-gallon jugs. I have had water-borne parasites (contracted here in the USA, probably from tap water) so pure water is important to me.<br /><br />I am downgrading this by one star because the claims seem a bit overblown. I mean, what does "Restructured through ionic separation" mean anyway? And "Hydrates better" than what?<br /><br />I'm glad that Essentia water comes in "BPA and Phthalate free recyclable bottles" and does not need to be shipped in from overseas. I believe in conserving natural resources while protecting health.<br /><br />Recently we moved to a home with well water. I thought this would be a blessing because I don't like the taste of chlorine. Unfortunately our well produces water that tastes bad and often stinks, even after going through a fancy conditioning system. So I only drink bottled water. I would purchase this water again if the price were comparable to the water I buy now.

review/summary: Seems to Provide Good Hydration After a Workout. Still A Little Skeptical, But Worth Trying if You are a Bottled Water Drinker.
review/text: Until I saw & read about 9.5 pH drinking water, I didn't know that I "needed" it.  I've read the information provided by the manufacturer and tried a 1.5 liter bottle, and still am not convinced that 9.5 pH is a "must have".  I can't say that the Essentia is better than my go-to filtered water, but I also can't say that my go-to filtered water is better either.  However, if you are a bottled water drinker anyway, Essentia may be a product for you to try.<br /><br />I drank 1/2 of the bottle after 2 separate workouts. After the first workout, I drank filtered water & still felt thirsty.  I decided to try the Essentia & it did quench my thirst. After the second work-out, I just drank the last of the Essentia & it seemed to quench my thirst.<br /><br />Taste-wise, I cannot tell any difference between Essentia and filtered water.  I detected no metallic taste.<br /><br />The Essentia seemed to "fill" my mouth a little more, but, with sampling only 1 bottle, I may have just been my imagination.<br /><br />If you are a bottled water drinker, Essentia is a product to try to see if it works for you.  If you are a filtered water drinker, your experience may be that your filtered water is just fine.

review/summary: Tastes silky smooth as advertised.
review/text: I normal drink Costco Kirkland water, it is my favorite bottled water. Drinking the two waters back to back, the Kirkland water does taste a bit more bitter than the Essentia. Like the bottle says, Essentia has a silky smooth taste to it. The bottle also says it hydrates better and it is electrolyte infused. I normally drink Gatorade for electrolytes, but I was told by a friend not to drink too much because of the extra salt in gatorade for when you sweat. They use salt as an electrolytes. But regardless, this is a better alternative to gatorade and it tastes good too.<br /><br />If you need your electrolytes this is probably way better than a sports drink. The nutrition facts states 0g of sodium, 0g of fat, 0 calories. But that is the same in all water isn't it?<br /><br />The bottle also states: "doctor recommended to protect, improve and enhance the quality of your health" I don't know if that is this water or water in general that is doctor recommended.<br /><br />In the end, I think I will stick to kirkland because it is way cheaper and the only thing it looks to be different is Essentia is electrolyte infused and kirkland is infused with minerals.

review/summary: As water goes, it's good. As a cure, it's hard to tell...
review/text: It's hard to review the efficacy of a product like Essentia's 9.5 pH Drinking Water after consuming just 1.5L (the sample size provided to Vine reviewers), so let's just say that as a water product goes, there's nothing either extraordinary or offensive about this H2O. The bottler went to a lot of work to fine tune the chemistry and flavor of this product (micro-filtration, UV lighting, reverse osmosis, mineral "enhancement" and something called ionic separation), but you're going to be disappointed if you pour a glass and expect it to taste like, umm, robust good health. Essentia's 9.5 pH Drinking Water tastes like...water, albeit with that trademark flat metallic taste that comes from altering the ingredient list a little.<br /><br />Is it worth the price? For somebody enduring the daily torment of GERD, I'd say it's definitely worth a try. Does it work? You'll have to rely on other reviewers to make that call.

Period. Compared to many other brands I've had, this actually does taste nice. Very, very slightly 'sweet' taste, with no hint of the iodiney/plasticky taste you normally get from bottled water. They did a good job here.<br /><br />+ : the 1.5 liter size means it's good to bring along on a sports trip or other adventure. I took mine with me when I went surfing and it provided plenty of hydration to counter the effects of hours of intense physical activity.<br /><br />- : these run about $2 / bottle -- perhaps not bad, really, given how much you get per bottle... but, it's also quite a bit of waste and a lot of bulk to be shipping from Amazon.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I'm not sure about the pH thing -- there are a lot of health gimmicks out there. However, this water seems to be a fair value and does indeed have a nice 'neutral' flavor. Tastes a lot like it came straight out of the R-O filter vs. being cooped up inside a plastic bottle. If I saw this at the convenience store and I was thirsty, I'd consider buying it over some other popular brands.

review/summary: Tastes great, comparable to Aquafina, but is it better for you?
review/text: I have medical issues and I need to drink a lot of water every day.  I know that many people can't tell that much of a difference between the various bottled waters, but I can.  My favorite water by far has been Aquafina and it just tastes fresher and sweeter to me.<br /><br />When I first started doing research on the difference between alkaline foods and acidic, and the differences between water that's been ionized and brands that haven't such as Aquafina, I found myself pretty confused. It seems that alkaline foods are just better for you and for my medical concerns (autoimmune problems and GERD and ischemic issues), but there appears to be a lot of disagreement as to what foods fit into what category. It can make you a little crazy trying to deal with all the disagreement from reputable sites.<br /><br />So I thought I'd give this water a try, since it's advertised as being better for you and not as acidic with a high PH level. Well I'm here to tell you that the water tastes very good (which is so important to me), but that I am just not sure I believe the claims that it's better for you. A very close friend was a dean of chemistry at our nearby state university and he told me not to believe the claims about these so-called "healthy waters" and that It just doesn't make a difference. He told me the same thing about claims that water is oxygenated - it doesn't pass scientific muster.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell you it makes a difference or doesn't because I just don't know. But if you want a good tasting water I would recommend this.

review/summary: Smooth, refreshing water. Does it live up to what it says? Yes. Is it going to improve your health? Yet to find out
review/text: Essentia delivers refreshing water with the ideal ph level of 9.5, along with electrolytes and minerals.<br /><br />I immediately felt a difference with this water. It was thin, pure, and tasted very clean. It did not have the bland, over-filtered taste of Aquafina nor Dasani. We need to have minerals and the natural tastes in our water.<br /><br />If you are looking for high quality water (who would've thought of such a thing existed), Essentia is it. It is a bit pricey for water though. However, for twelve 1.5 liter bottles in the $25 - $30 range, it seems priced as if you were buying soda or juice. If you want an alternative to sugary beverages, Essentia may give you a good case for a premium water that is enjoyable to drink.

review/summary: Neutral taste, low pH
review/text: For those looking for a non-flavoured water beverage and one with a neutral taste that doesn't have plastic-y aftertaste, this one's for you.<br /><br />Also, traditional tap water is slightly more acidic (I believe pH 7-8).  Essentia's is supposed at 9.5 pH, so if you're very sensitive to acidic products, this might help you out.

review/summary: Ph Balanced Water
review/text: There are a few things that I look for in a bottled drinking water.  One is oxygenation which a few bottled water companies put out.  Pente water is my favorite of this kind (and has stabilized medicinal grade oxygen).  Oxygen tends to alkalize.  Two is a Ph balanced water.  Essentia is my favorite one of these.  I find that I drink the whole bottle very quickly, because it satisfies a need.  The body likes the balance that it gives.  It helps rehydrate and for the body to remove toxins.  One of the curious ways that this shows up is that when I drink a ph balanced water, I tend to go to the bathroom very soon afterwards (and you can tell from the urine color and from how much the urine "bubbles" that it is removing toxins).  It seems to move through the body quicker.  When my father needed to alkalize, I had recommended that he take Pente water.  But he could not find it where he was and he stumbled on Essentia water and found it worked for him and got similar results to Pente water.  I got a bottle of the Essentia water from the Amazon review program partly because it had worked for my father.  I could taste the difference, taste the minerals that made it more alkaline.  It felt slightly thicker than regular water and slightly smoother.  I drank up the whole 1.5 liter bottle within less than an hour because it felt like it was satisfying a need inside me.  If I had to choose, I would probably still pick some Pente water over the Essentia water, because the oxygen still alkalizes and has other benefits from the oxygen itself.  But Essentia would be my second choice.  If I was stocking up, however, I would get both of them.  My guess is that there different approaches to alkalizing would make them complimentary.

review/summary: Tastes Pretty Good!
review/text: Essentia tastes great. I am usually a Fiji fan, but Essentia takes the prize because of its 9.5 pH. There is no major difference that I can describe, however, there is a subtle difference. I don't know if it is just the alkylinity, but whatever the reason, I like it.<br /><br />They do sell machines that can create high pH water, but the decent ones start at $700! That makes Essentia a real bargain. Now, whether you buy into the health claims or not, well, that's a different story. Having been treated for Stage four cancer, I'm trying it, and will keep stocking it as long as I can find it. The idea that a more alkyline pH can help fight off cancer has been written up  many times, however, the validity of those claims are somewhat questionable, and until something appears in a peer reviewed medical journal (and is not funded by Essentia) it remains a matter of opinion. I will update if I find more information. As far as staying hydrated better, I don't know, and without blood tests I don't think I could tell....but like I said, it tastes good.

review/summary: Tastes slightly sweeter than regular water...
review/text: I'm not sure if all of Essentia's claims are credible, but it certainly tastes good.  The taste is noticeably sweeter and more mellow than that of regular filtered or spring water.  I appreciate the fact that the container itself is BPA and Phthalate-free and I don't have to worry about those chemicals leaching into my water after long periods of storage.  At the least, I can store my spring water in the Essentia empty bottles.

review/summary: Ok, but wouldn't seek  this out
review/text: I was intrigued by the idea of a high PH water. I have trouble with acidity, having 2 conditions which are aggravated by high-acid water, however, I can't say I really liked this water, or found it much different in taste than my regular spring water. True, it is high ph, but, I neither found it especially refreshing nor much different in taste than tap water. Although it was interesting to try, I don't see me gong out of my way to buy this or see much difference in taste to make it worth switching.

review/summary: Tastes Like Water...What More Is There To Say?
review/text: Alright so this is a pretty lame review, I'll admit, but I can't find a lot to say about Essentia Drinking Water. It doesn't taste bad so that's something. It doesn't really taste like anything that I could pick up. Water is water. I'm sure if you did a blind taste test between Essentia and a couple other brands of bottled water there might be some difference but as is it is pretty...watery? So don't buy it for its taste but at the same time don't NOT buy it for its taste.<br /><br />If you're purchasing Essentia is is probably for the "health benefits." So if that is something important to you (not a real concern to me) then you might want to consider purchasing this but do your research first. Apparently health claims are unverified.<br /><br />I can't really imagine a reason for spending $30 for bottled water but hey, different strokes for different folks.

review/text: Water is water, right?  I thought so until I tasted Essentia.  Water is water but this has a clearer, cleaning more refreshing taste.<br /><br />For those who exercise and worry about replacing electrolytes, this water has been infused with them!  What better way to replace electrolytes and get your 8 glasses of water a day at the same time.  And if you drink the whole bottle, which is 50 fluid ounces, you have had six glasses towards that goal.

review/summary: taste a bit alkaline
review/text: The product description for this water emphasizes that it has a pH of 9.5 (compared to around 7.4 for normal water) and that this somehow cures every disease known to man and drastically improves your health. First of all, I'm always suspicious of a food or beverage company making over-the-top claims about the health benefits of its product without rigorous scientific evidence. Unfortunately, too many people are gullible these days and will buy anything that promises better health.<br /><br />I don't have the medical expertise to really evaluate these claims. What I do know is that the water does taste a bit more alkaline than regular spring water. The company is at least right in that regard - you can taste the difference. Unfortunately, I'm personally not crazy about the taste - it doesn't taste as fresh. I'd recommend tasting it first and seeing whether you like the taste, rather than investing this for its supposed medicinal value.

review/text: If you're a believer in the alkaline versus acidic diet for optimum health, this Essentia 9.5 pH drinking water is for you. It is a lot cheaper than the water system that you need to buy for few thousand dollars and install. You can try first few Essentia bottles and figure out if high alkaline water is helpful to your health before you launch into buying expensive systems.

review/summary: Meant to be served COLD.
review/text: From a health & wellness perspective, I defer to the other reviews which are quite thorough and complete.  From a taste perspective, this product must be served cold to have a fresh refreshing taste. Many waters are served warm, especially if you walk or travel with it. This is not one I would suggest for that purpose.  Served cold, the taste is clean, crisp and refreshing. If the water isn't quite chilled the taste may edge toward "left on the night stand over night and degassed..."

review/summary: Tastes like water.  Very good water.
review/text: I was really concerned that this water would have a weird or salty taste to it, but nope.  It tastes just like water... probably closer to Dasani than to Poland Spring, and nothing like Evian (not surprising, since the label indicates they use reverse osmosis to do the purification, which is what Dasani does).<br /><br />Most surprisingly, there really is something to the "silky smooth taste," it's not purely marketing.  Whether from the high pH or something else, this is just good water.  (That said, I don't necessarily feel better hydrated than I would with regular water.)<br /><br />Regarding the health claims of alkali water, YMMV.  To their credit, Essentia doesn't really make any of the claims on the bottle, but Google them or look them up on other products here on Amazon.  Some people are hard core believers, some think they're bunk.  I am not really qualified to give a real scientific judgement on them, but I started looking into alkaline water after reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470913029">The Paleo Diet: Lose Weight and Get Healthy by Eating the Foods You Were Designed to Eat</a>.  There's an interesting rant in the book about the acid/base balance in the body (in short, the contention is that lots of grains lead to the body being to acidic and an acidic body is bad).  The suggestion there is basically to eat lots of vegetables, but my immediate thought was "why not just drink alkaline water?"  I have no idea of the answer.<br /><br />If you're curious, the plastic bottle is a PETE 1.  Also, these are 1.5 Litre bottles, which are quite big.

review/summary: Alkaline water for good health
review/text: This is a highly alkaline water of 9.5 pH.<br /><br />The body is a chemical soup made up of both acid and alkaline substances.  Blood in the body is kept at a pH of between 7.35 and 7.45.  Most of the things we eat and drink are acidic, in addition to a certain acidity of the air we breath.  Therefore, proponents of drinking alkaline water say it helps neutralize the acidity of the body by drinking alkaline water.<br /><br />According to the Mayo Clinic, "Some studies suggests that alkaline water may help slow bone loss, but further investigation is needed to determine if this influences overall bone mineral density and if the benefit is maintained over the long term."  No other studies that I could find have been done to test the health benefits of drinking alkaline water.<br /><br />We can now buy bottled water that is specifically alkaline, such as this highly alkaline<br />Essentia bottled water.  It has a clean taste and is delicious.  I mix it was a little<br />xylitol <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CNOUWQ">Health Garden Kosher Birch Xylitol 1 Lbs. Product of USA (Not From Corn)</a> and use it as a mouth rinse morning and evening to neutralize the acids in my mouth<br />from food.  The xylitol helps harden the tooth enamel.<br /><br />This water is very pure tasting and refreshing.  It is soft tasting.  It is perfect if you get frequent acid indigestion.  This also is a good way to finish a meal.  The alkalinity will neutralize the acidity of the food you just ate, therefore making it soothing to your upper digestive tract including the esophagus and the stomach.<br /><br />I will keep buying this delicious bottled water and add it to my current variety of bottled waters I keep in the fridge.  I also drink Fiji, a very pure water from an underground spring in Fiji, Smart Water which is similar to this in that it also is purified tap water, and San Pelligrino, the most mineral laden spring water you can buy as far as I can tell, but also very refreshing.<br /><br />This particular water goes well with a meal and helps sooth the digestive tract.

review/summary: Muscle spasms
review/text: My wife has recurring extreme muscle spasms, usually late at night or early morning.  We started to use this water for her about 6 months ago.  It has been the best purchase we have ever made [I am not kidding].  I haven't noticed anyone mentioning this benefit, but I can assure you it works!!  We ran out a couple of days ago and had to wait and do without for about 3 days.  She had awful muscle spasms in both legs last night.  Back to where she was before we starting using this water.  We were really thankful that we received 3 cases this morning.  I have vowed "as god is my witness I will never run out of Essentia water again" {from the movie Gone with the wind, ha ha]. But for real, we are now ordering 4 case per month so that we will never run out again.

review/summary: The only bottled still water I drink...
review/text: Some people debate about the high PH - one can Google to find the issues and discussion. I used to drink Trinity water but they went out of business. I found Essentia and found I like it better.<br /><br />I only drink bottled water -- Essentia is expensive so I use other spring water for making coffee and cooking. But I drink a minimum of four 8 oz glasses a day -- often six. (The recommendation of 8 glasses of water per day has now been found to be excessive. Four to six will do -- but it definitely makes a difference doing so -- my skin becomes smoother and clear within days, it helps when I work out.<br /><br />I now get it through Amazon through subscribe and save -- it is cheaper than in the stores (even in Whole Foods with a 10% case discount) and it is too much of a hassle to ensure the stores have it -- as they are quite inconsistent with their water ordering.<br /><br />The taste I find delicious and superb. My partner prefers Glaceaus' smart water. He drinks it at room temperature and it has a lower but still substantial Ph.<br /><br />In researching for this review I have learned about two other waters with high Ph's: Kagen and Qure. There are differences among all three and I haven't had the time to nail down the differences and which would be deemed more healthy. I probably will do that sometime in the future.<br /><br />But you can't go wrong with Essentia. Try some (chilled in the fridge) and see if you like it. Your body certainly will.

review/summary: Great tasting
review/text: I think the Essentia drinking water tastes very good.  There are a couple popular brands of bottled water that I think taste funny.  The Essentia is very good and "crisp".  I can't say much about the actual pH level, because I did not test it.  However, I didn't seem to have as many issues with my acid relux on the days when I drank the Essentia.  It's awkward carrying the 1.5 liter bottle around, but I did actually find it helpful.  I take it to work in the morning and make myself drink it until it's gone before I allow myself to have something "good" (meaning - bad for me).  Therefore, I do get a  much larger water intake during the day at the office than I normally would.  So, I love the taste and the size of the bottle, but it can get expensive.  I will probably keep some on hand, especially when my acid reflux is really acting up and the prilosec isn't helping, but I'm not sure if I could really afford to buy it to have every single day.

review/summary: Darn Good Water
review/text: Okay, I can't really speak to Essentia's claims regarding its 9.5pH balanced water. I just know that it's refreshing and tastes (if water has a taste) pure and satisfying. No off flavors or odors. I know that it has some additives to bring the pH to 9.5, but I can't detect them. One of these large 1.5 liter bottles lasts me all day.<br /><br />If Essentia's claims are accurate and it does help with things like maintaining normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and boosting the antioxidant properties of your immune system, then so much the better. It does seem to hydrate well and absorb into my system faster than regular filtered or spring water. I also get occasional heartburn after certain meals and find that its more basic pH helps alleviate such symptoms without me having to take antacids.<br /><br />Essentia does cost a bit more so I will reserve getting it for when I find it on sale or can get a bulk discount. Aside from the price, I have to say it is my new favorite 'brand' of water. I like the taste and find it thirst quenching. Any added health benefits are a bonus.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/summary: Try It, It May Help . . .
review/text: I received my case of Essentia bottled water just in time to try out while I experienced a sore throat and upper respiratory congestion.  Usually, I battle one of these complete with headache and cough from start to finish for around two weeks at least once every winter season.  However, this particular virus didn't hold on for that long--after day three, I was already feeling better and able to function at 98%.<br /><br />I have no idea of knowing just exactly what aided me so quickly in this battle.  I've been experimenting with<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DJDNM4">Rainbow Light Counter Attack, 90-Count</a>--taking 1-3 of these a day during the whole period of Eastern Standard Time.  I've upped my Vitamin C intake with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CD9XGC">Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C, Box of 30 packets</a>--and slugged down the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009ETASU">Nature's Way Sambucus Syrup, 4-Ounce</a>--yes, I do not like to be slowed down by cold or flu--the headaches I experience are debilitating in the extreme.  During the cold's initial three-day siege on my body, I also upped my water intake with hope that I would be helping my body expel move the healing process along faster.<br /><br />Needless to say, the case of water came in really handy, as I was not in any shape to drive a vehicle to even run the most essential errands.  I actually heated Essentia to make tea--I have no idea whether or not this effects any of the alkaline properties???--if anyone understands this better than I please feel free to offer exposition.  The outcome was a good one--I shook the cold in around 5 complete days, the last two of which I was well on my way to feeling fully functional--without over-the-counter decongestants and cough syrups.<br /><br />I had originally agreed to try the Essentia in order to test it with my running--I am always looking for something that will help me recuperate faster after a good run.  Unfortunately I was not able to do this as the virus took hold'<br /><br />When I can afford it, I purchase<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061EXBU">Penta Water Purified, .5 LT Bottles (Pack of 24)</a>r--which actually does help athletes recuperate faster--but as this tends to get expensive--I was purchasing this from my personal trainer--I thought Essentia might prove to be a good substitute.  That part of my review is officially in a wait state; I promise to edit this once I try Essentia in relation to athletic performance.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, this water definitely tastes smoother.  Like Penta, it goes down a lot easier.  I do not experience acid reflex symptoms, so I cannot comment on the water's effectiveness with regard to this.  There is no comparison between the tap water here in the New Orleans area and Essentia water.  Essentia wins this taste war hands down.  Tap here has a nasty chlorine taste, which I simply do not like.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Essentia water seems to have been one weapon in an arsenal of wellbeing products that recently helped me remain healthy.  Supposedly, high-alkaline water aids in promoting wellness in the following way:<br />* Super hydrates your body<br />* Alkalizes your body<br />* Oxygenates your cells<br />* Detoxifies your body<br />* Protects you from Free Radical Damage<br />* Provides the foundation that enhances everything you are doing for optimum health.<br />Now while there may be no "proof" of these claims--think back in the history of medicine, where practitioners came up with treatments that had no solid backing until more knowledge was accumulated--perhaps, trying something as simple as this will help you feel better and live a better life.  In terms of price, this water is considerably less expensive than some of the other ionized waters out there. Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"

I'm not really sure water needs to be improved in this way.<br /><br />I think they would do better to further educate the customer as to why you would care that much about the pH.  And "hydrates better" is really a vague statement.  Better than what?  How much better?<br /><br />Anyway if you like trying different kinds of water (like my wife does) you will find that it does go down silky smooth.<br /><br />Overall I think its good, I just think that the benefits outlined are very sketchy, so I remove a star for that.

review/summary: Does it really help?
review/text: I am used to all types of water including tap water. If you weren't told otherwise, this water tastes 'normal'. However, if you tell someone that it is special water, then the person thinks that they can taste a slight difference. We'd need a blind taste test to figure that one out.<br /><br />This water though isn't about taste -- it is about the special properties of the water and what it can do for the drinker. For me I couldn't feel a major difference but I am not a power athlete nor do I think I have problems drinking other types of water. My mistake in reviewing this product is that I shared the water with my friends for their opinion instead of drinking it solid for a few days. Such a test may help me better understand if this water makes a true difference. It might be that the creators of this water intend for a person to drink this water over weeks/months to get the true benefits. If that is the case, this is just too expensive for me.

review/text: Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.5 Liter, (Pack of 12)<br /><br />I cannot say that the claimed health benefits of this water are true. In order to prove or disprove that, I would have to hire a team of scientists and do expensive and exhaustive tests on myself. I'm not going to do that!<br /><br />What I can tell you is that I have well water and it is extremely high in iron and has to have a softener added to make the water palatable. My problem with that is that I'm on a low salt diet for a heart condition so I now have to double filter my drinking water. It's filtered once at the beginning of the well and again in a separate filter in my fridge.<br />This is some of the info from the Essentia web site, and the product description from here- "Drinking Essentia Water helps bring you back into balance and helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more. Plus, Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system."<br /><br />I have to admit that I did drink a whole bottle of this for the last few days---and I have been sleeping better (Can't tell you if it's a coincidence). IF the claims of lowering blood pressure and heart health are true that will be a plus for me, but right now as I said only long-term usage and the help of my doctor will tell me if the claims are true.<br /><br />It tastes better than my well water and actually, it does have a `smooth' sort of taste to it. Of course, since it's bottled it is convenient to tote around and to keep some in my car too.<br /><br />The problem is, is that I'm not so sure if it is worth $2.40 a bottle without the subscription with the subscription it comes to $2.04 a bottle. If you drink the amount of water Doctors recommend, that will come to approximately 300.00 a month (much more if you want to use this water to make your coffee tea etc. for added health benefits ). In addition, having to haul a heavy case of water up the stairs a few times a month does not turn me on.

review/summary: It's marketed water that is not at an ideal pH for the body
review/text: This water purportedly contains 9.5 ph. However, the purported benefits of high pH water are not demonstrated in scientific literature, only in this company's marketing materials. The fact is that the ideal pH level of drinking water should be between 6-8.5. The body maintains a pH equilibrium on a constant basis that is not affected by water consumption of higher or lower pH, unless it's consistent consumption on a regular basis. In fact, our stomachs have a naturally low pH level of about 2, which is helpful for food digestion, and our stomachs will self-adjust to maintain this naturally low pH level.<br /><br />Yes, it's water, and Amazon will ship 12 bottles to you for about 2 bucks a bottle. If you do choose to get this monster shipment, also consider purchasing carbon off-sets.

review/summary: Great water, but bogus marketing claims
review/text: Essentia water tastes great, and its price is in the same ball park as other good quality bottled water. However, stating that the 9.5 pH is good for you is completely devoid of any scientific substance. In fact, there are a lot of scientific studies that completely refute these claims. There's a page by a retired chemistry professor, who rips into the variety of similar "alkalanized" and "ionized" water marketing claims. Most importantly, his page contains a lot of links to University and other scientific research results that all undermine the important of the 9.5 pH. Having said all that, I do like the taste of Essentia water, so whatever minerals it has in it does make for great tasting, pleasant to drink water. Just don't fall for the pH hype until and unless you read the science reports instead of trusting any marketing hype.<br />[...]

review/summary: Essentia: Improved Taste, Improved Digestion
review/text: Essentia 9.5 PH Drinking water is a bottled water made with good digestive health in mind. It takes the ordinary concept of bottled water a few steps further by adding calcium chloride, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulphate, and sodium bicarbonate. It then elevates the PH for better digestion and the reverse osmosis and purification via micro- filtration help make for the cleanest possible taste.<br /><br />We have all heard recommendations from experts that bottled water is a bunch of hype and not worth the money and for the most part I agree with this assessment. The majority of bottled waters on the market are nothing special and not worth the expenditure. But there are some bottled waters that are enhanced in ways that make them better and Essentia is one of them. The added minerals and improved processes help elevate this water to a level not matched by most bottled water products. The higher PH makes the product more alkaline and this suits someone like me very well, since I sometimes suffer from acid reflux. After a heavy meal, my stomach actually feels better if I drink this water.<br /><br />As for the taste, I find it very smooth and clean- the way water should taste. I have taste-tested this, side by side, against the water that comes out of my water filter pitcher and I can say that, while both taste good, this product is a little cleaner and smoother in flavor. It does cost more than the water out of my water filtered pitcher, but the taste is a little bit better.<br /><br />Essentia is packaged in BPA free plastic bottles and it is made with environmental concerns in mind. Combine that with the taste and improvements in digestion and you have a clear, bottled- water winner in my book.

review/summary: This is the BEST tasting water I ever had - period! (yeah I gave 5 stars to - water!)
review/text: Ok.. lets get one thing straight.. I can't believe I am raving about.. water!<br />When I got this bottle I read the bottle "hmm 9.5 ph.? reverse osmosis? electrolytes? yeah ..whatever" and popped it into the fridge<br />I had some yesterday after cutting the lawn and said "hmm this water tastes.... good?"<br />It had some kind of I dunno.. taste to it; anyway, I liked it and  that was that.<br /><br />Well today I had to pack 2500 markers.. basically 50 bundles weighing 50 pounds each, in the lovely NJ humid air.<br />I open this stuff.. and WHOA... this is freaking good water! I literally drank the remaining bottle on the spot.. fast enough it gave me a brain freeze a few times!  And you know what I actually *felt* better later.. Refreshed.. definitely hydrated -- and I want MORE of this water!<br /><br />Ok .. the water has electrolytes added (or "infused") and as you read in the listing:<br />"Essentia drinking water is purified through micro-filtration, UV lighting and reverse osmosis; No chlorine or flouride; Enhanced with pure minerals; Restructured through ionic separation"<br />ok....<br />.. I have NO idea what that means..... but I DO KNOW it tastes GREAT.. I can't explain it but it really *REALLY* does taste "Crisp" and there .. and I don't mean it in a bad way - a "mineral" taste to it.. I truly can't explain it.. but I can honesty say this is really REALLY good water..<br /><br />I would HIGHLY recommend this.. even if you try a small bottle at a local store (I don't know if it is available) and see for yourself.. then come back here and get a case!<br /><br />Thanks for reading !<br />-- a very hydrated Jim :)

review/summary: No chemical taste and nice size bottle
review/text: I found this to be a clean and refreshing bottle of water.  I liked the:<br /><br />1) Taste:  I like the taste of this water, especially cold.  I did not notice any chemical flavors.  It was refreshing and as the label claims, had a "smooth" taste.<br /><br />2) Bottle size:  I love the size of the bottles.  The 1.5 liter is a great size to keep by your work desk and while working out.  This was the perfect amount of water for an hour long workout.<br /><br />3) Recyclable bottle:  I also like that the company used a #1 Pete bottle, which is readily recyclable in most communities.<br /><br />While all of the above are true, I didn't find this to taste significantly better than my local tap water.  It is convenient and refreshing, but unless you have some hard core minerals or chemicals coming out of your faucet, I don't know if this water will blow you away.<br /><br />This water is bottled in Bothell, Washington.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride.

review/summary: Tastes great, but it is just water
review/text: I've always been a skeptic of water that claims to be better for you than regular water.<br /><br />The product summary says "Essentia Water provides unmatched hydration, health benefits and smooth taste. Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive. Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance."<br /><br />I have no doubt that drinking water like this non stop every day might have health benefits. But is it worth the cost or the time to constantly be buying this water. I don't think so.<br /><br />The bottle I got off Amazon Vine tasted great and was refreshing, but I have other things to spend my money on besides water.

review/summary: At The End of the Day, It's Just Water in a Fancy Bottle
review/text: At the end of the day, it's just water.<br /><br />The label claims a lot of things such as a silky smooth taste, better hydration, the infusion of electrolytes, and the "best available pH at 9.5" which I really can't comment on as I didn't have any scientific equipment to test the pH level.<br /><br />I wish I could give you some flowery comments like you can with wine, such as having the ability to smell a hint of apricots, smoke, and charcoal while drinking this, but I can't.  I will tell you the water somehow tastes different (and better) really cold vs. room temperature.<br /><br />After trying this water myself and being unable to conjure up a "wow" factor, in order to see if there is a taste difference with this water I set up a "Water Challenge" similar to the old Pepsi Challenge with two of my co-workers as follows: I poured equal amounts of cold water in cups containing the Essentia water, water from a Walmart / Sam's-branded bottle of water, and water from the tap that had gone through a filtration device in the office.  The results were incredible - you couldn't tell a difference and the limited test subjects were unable to correctly identify the "better" water.  For clarification, the Walmart-branded bottle was first for one participant and tap water was first for the other.<br /><br />In other words, there is nothing wrong with this water.  However, if you look at the cost/benefit analysis of purchasing this water - including shipping from Amazon - the accountant in me just can't say I need to make sure I buy this in the future: it's way too pricey per ounce when, at the end of the day, there's probably nothing wrong with the water coming out of your tap if you have basic filtration on it.

review/summary: Great Water for Workouts!
review/text: If you are looking for large bottles of water that has basic essentials to help keep your body hydrated then this water is perfect for you.  The water itself is refreshing.  It does not have the "metal" taste sometimes that you might find in some other more popular waters on the market.  The taste is 100% water.  For someone wishing only to drink water and yet add other things to it, this water is perfect.<br /><br />The plus of this water is the bottles themselves.  They are large and if you are doing a slower workout, this water should last the entire time and even more.  A tougher workout would probably exhaust the water but is perfect as it provides the necessary nutrients to help you after the workout is over.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased by this water.  A box of this water will last you a while.

review/text: The water tastes like every other bottled water. I have no idea whether the PH of the water makes any real difference. I did not realize these bottles were going to be so huge (over 50 ounces), so it was a struggle getting them up the stairs. It also makes them somewhat bulky to use. The price seems expensive, but when you consider that these bottles are over twice the size of most bottled waters, it is reasonable.

review/summary: False advertising
review/text: I'm so disappointed in this company! I've been drinking this water for quite a while now, but yesterday I saw my nutritionist and she checked my pH level which was acidic.  I told her that was surprising considering how much alkaline water I drink.  She suggested we test the pH of my bottle of Essentia,  so we did.  The pH was ACIDIC at 6.6!!  I was livid!  Now to be fair..I am a nurse and know that the pH strips can expire and should be stored and handled a certain way and should also be tested by buffers.  I can't guarantee my nutritionist followed these steps so I plan on purchasing my own pH strips and checking the water again.  I sure hope the strip was wrong and the next test will yield different results!  I will definitely post those results either way!

review/summary: Tasted Like Plain Water...Question the Claims
review/text: This 1.5 Liter bottle of water tasted just like water. If you want water with baking soda in it that tastes like water, this seems like a good bet. I was worried about the taste...It didn't taste great to me (I guess I'm a bit of a water snob drinking only home delivery purified water) and I prefer simple RO water.<br /><br />But the big selling point of this water is that it is alkaline. The reality is that your body has a built-in pH regulating system in your lungs and your kidneys. Want to increase your blood pH? Breathe faster. But even then, when you stop thinking about it, your brain will regulate your breathing and your kidneys will adjust to make your blood pH whatever your body wants it to be. You may be able to cause some short-term changes in your blood pH by changing the pH of your water. But your lungs will quickly compensate. You may see some differences in your stomach pH and thus some relief of indigestion similar to taking an antacid. But if you are having gastrointestinal symptoms from acid, you probably shouldn't be treating with alkaline water but should seek medical help to see if you have something more serious going on or should get some more effective antacid medications that have fewer side effects than alkaline antacids. I can find no research to substantiate the claims that alkaline water is beneficial for your health.

review/text: Firstly, I am picky with water. I do not like Aquafina or Dasani because I think they taste like the plastic bottle. My favorite waters are Deer Park and Poland Spring. Both have a clean, crisp flavor, with no funky after taste or odd plastic taste.<br /><br />Essentia has a nice clean, fresh taste. Just pure clean water. No after taste, no odd tastes overall. I love the bigger sized bottle. I cannot attest to the benefits of drinking pH water specifically because I only tried the one bottle and of course did not see any benefits or notice anything spectacularly different from any other water.<br /><br />I suppose if you have great interest in the long term benefits of drinking Essentia with its 9.5pH and if you do not mind the price, it is worth it. I myself cannot see spending so much on bottled water, although it does have a very good, pure taste.

review/summary: I've had better...
review/text: Like many other reviewers have stated, many of the special points of this water are just marketing claims, and I agree. There's nothing really special about this product, it's basically flavorless Gatorade. I also found it funny that it comes "doctor recommended" but there is no information about which doctors or what kind recommend this product and why. Supposedly the high-pH makes it healthier for you because the lower amount of acidity somehow magically makes it a health product of some kind. What does having a high-pH level do exactly? From what I've read with my minor amount of research, it's supposed to increase your metabolism, boost your energy levels and other jargon-filled, specious claims that many other health foods make. None of these things have been proven, so why crow about it?<br /><br />This is a good water in that it tastes good, but I'm giving it a low rating because of all the dubious health and medical claims that the company makes regarding this product.

review/summary: Tastes great, filtered several times ... but not sure about the hype or the price
review/text: This company's got a very interesting philosophy - to filter the water with reverse osmosis (which is what we use at home), then also to run through UV sterilization, then add minerals, electrolytes, and some sort of baking soda to boost the pH. It's completely overkill, but I'm unaware of any other bottled water that goes to these extremes.<br /><br />The taste is great, and it actually helped settle my stomach after a bad trip to the salad bar.<br /><br />However ... when I tested the pH level at home (I tested it three times using litmus paper from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBMAVQ">Home Water Test Kit</a> I bought on Amazon), the results were the exact same as my tap water.<br /><br />Keep in mind, I'm no expert. And the Essentia web site says litmus paper doesn't work on their water (I still don't understand why - maybe there's a chemistry teacher out there who can chime in?).<br /><br />Others have complained that Essentia is just tap water that's been filtered - but I see that as a huge perk. Being able to bottle it very close to the point of sale is much more environmental & cost effective than hauling glacier water half way around the world. Since they add minerals & electrolytes, additives can be measured, consistent, and guaranteed clean.<br /><br />My bottom line: I like the taste, I like the electrolytes, I like the size of the bottles (1.5 liters) and that they're BPA-free & Phthalate-free. I still think the price point is too high, and I'm not sure about all their marketing claims.<br /><br />I think I'll stick with our reverse osmosis system at home, and use Essentia for when I'm feeling acidic or ill.

review/summary: Water, water, everywhere...but not a drop to drink
review/text: I think one of the other reviewers summed up my feelings best concerning this product with their intro line to their review, "Have you ever had...dry water?"  I understand the health benefits of drinking bottled water, but I did not like the taste of this one.  Another reviewer described this water as having a "silky taste" but I could not get the dry like, metalic taste out of my mouth after I drank this.<br /><br />My family did not seem to like this either.  My Husband stated he preferred tap water, after I fixed him a glass.  My 9 year old son made a face as he tried to drink it, stated he did not want to finish it, and proceeded to pour the rest down the sink.  My 11 year old tried it, stated he liked milk more than any other kind of beverage, and also said he did not want more.<br /><br />Again, for the health benefits the company advertises related to this water, perhaps that is why some people have given this water rave reviews.  It is simply not for me or for my family. I like tap water, and because tap water has fluoride in it, I feel tap water is better for bones and teeth.  This product was a free sample, and this is not a product I would ever buy.

review/summary: Not the Best
review/text: I liked the water going down, but the aftertaste hit me and I thought of piercings for some reason. The metal taste was not overpowering but, when I pay for water, I don't expect to notice it. I'm not gonna waste your time with a long review, i'll just say it this way. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd place this way above tap water but below Smart Water. honestly, I'd just get it if i was keen on buying something more than the 24 packs out there.

review/summary: Smooth water
review/text: I always buy bottled water so i have tasted a good range of water. Some bottled water has a mineral after-taste or just in general has a weird taste... there is no such issues like that with this. It's just refreshing and clean water. I can heartily recommend this water for anyone that is interested in it.

review/summary: A nice big bottle of water
review/text: This is a very nice and very BIG bottle of water. If you are spending the day fishing or outside, this one bottle can replace several smaller ones. The water has a very good taste, no mineral flavors or after taste. As too the health benefits, just drinking water is a health benefit in its self. So the added electrolytes and pH benefits are a bonus.

review/summary: Silky taste - good hydration
review/text: Decided to try a 9.5 water hearing someone raving about it for hydration at the salon.  I have to say that the taste is very smooth and silky and extremely refreshing.<br /><br />I don't have the acid control issues other reviewers have so I can't speak for that.  I do, however, feel that this hydrates better and quenches thirst better than plain water after a workout.

review/summary: Tap water for the price of spring water
review/text: On a cost-per-ounce basis, this product is far closer to fancy imported spring waters from tropical islands than it is to any of the other purified tap waters available in their single-use plastic bottles.<br /><br />And that's all it is: purified tap water, with baking soda and a few other things added.<br /><br />Is the pH really 9.5? Who knows. Most of us aren't going to spend the money to buy the equipment to test it. (And that's not even getting into the company's interesting claim that the water is 'too pure' to test with cheap litmus paper. If the water were pure, the pH would be 7. All the fun chemicals they add to change the pH necessarily make it no longer pure.)<br /><br />What i can say is, whatever the pH was, it made no impression on a mild case of heartburn, the kind that can be knocked out with one or two chewable antacid tablets. I didn't feel more hydrated after 1.5 liters of this than i'd feel after 1.5 liters of any other water.<br /><br />The taste? Water. I drink a lot of water, mostly straight tap water, sometimes filtered with a standard filter pitcher, and every once in a while from a pre-packaged bottle of water when i plan badly and my reusable bottle runs dry. Essentia wasn't noticeably different.<br /><br />There are a lot of websites out there that promise all sorts of health benefits for drinking high pH water. There are even some people with an MD after their name that back up the claims. But that's the great thing about the internet: there's a website for everything, and often someone with a fancy degree swearing it's all true.<br /><br />So if you want to pay a pile of money for water that is, at its core, tap water with some stuff filtered out and other stuff added in, that's your business. But if you believe all the marketing hype, well, i've got a bridge for sale...

review/text: I had read many of the other reviews and thought that it may have a weird taste.  My friends and I did not notice any weird taste or after taste, it tasted just like spring water.  I think that it is too pricey to help with upset stomachs, I think an antacid would work better.  I didn't notice any difference after drinking this.

review/summary: Like Drinking Water With Baking Soday and Epsom Salts In It
review/text: I know I might be a dissenter here, but I really tried to enjoy this water.  It wasn't HORRIBLE, but it wasn't that wonderful either.  I kept tasting the salty flavor associated with baking soda- it is slight but still there-not something that I find refreshing or exciting for sure.  The water itself didn't taste awful, and compared to some bottled water, I thought it was less salty (as in the type associated with table salt).<br /><br />I am very sensitive to changes that happen when I consume things, and I didn't see any great improvement in my feeling or well being after having this water.  For bottled water, it is slightly better than other brands, but in all honesty, I didn't see anything super wonderful about it either.  I drank it in various kinds of weather from super hot to colder and in all types of weather, it just didn't seem to make me very excited.  It was okay.<br /><br />If I had to rely on bottled water, I might purchase this once in a while, but I wouldn't put it at the top of my grocery list.  It just isn't that remarkable to me.  It is definitely superior to chlorinated city water, but I have a decent well for water, and it gives me much more energy than this does.

review/text: We taste tested the Essentia today. To our taste buds it had a simultaneously sweet and musty flavor. We typically get the Costco water which has similar electrolytes added. The Costco water tastes a little bit bitter, but I don't get the sweet/musty taste.<br /><br />Final verdict: Essentia is okay, but not a water I'd run to purchase.

review/summary: Not very natural... for water
review/text: My initial review was going to be... this is water! Tastes like water!<br />However, it has an actual particular metallic and nasty aftertaste. Drinking it straight from the plastic bottle. Maybe it's the added "electrolytes" which is actually just a bit of chemicals. But this water doesn't taste very natural.

review/summary: Not for giraffe-rinsing
review/text: ****<br /><br />For several years I have been seriously studying various bottled waters, and after researching this particular one quite thoroughly I have reached a number of conclusions, which I will now reveal for free despite the fact these tests have cost me a lot of time and money over the years.<br /><br />First, it's mostly water.  In fact, it is for all practical purposes all water.<br /><br />According to my high-quality, thoroughly calibrated pH meter, which I reviewed elsewhere, the alkalinity of this particular bottle of water is much closer to 9.3 than 9.5, but that's only 2.105% lower, which I think makes no difference unless you drink dozens of gallons a day and dozens more a night, which if you do might come you down with hyponatremia.<br /><br />This water has a particular taste both in the mouth during drinking and afterwards.  Unlike trying to describe exactly how a wine tastes - "An insouciant trace of dried foxglove petals masked almost but not completely by overarching reminiscences of the mature essences of oak barrels and lightly smoked hedgehog droppings," you know what I mean - trying to describe how the product under review tastes is simpler.<br /><br />Water.<br /><br />It tastes like water.<br /><br />It tastes like water as you're drinking it.<br /><br />After you've finished drinking some and you wait awhile to see whether there's any degree of afterbirth, there isn't.  It's exactly as though you had drunk water.  Which you had.<br /><br />****<br /><br />It freezes at 31.875 degrees Fahrenheit.  It boils at 210.77 degrees, not the 212 you might have expected, because I conducted the testing at 720 feet above MSL, but the point is that the boiling point of pure water at 720 feet up is 210.76 degrees.<br /><br />****<br /><br />It puts out a campfire just as well as tap water, and it puts out a campfire just as well as bottled water that doesn't contain sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, which is alkaline, which raises the pH level), dipotassium phosphate (derived exclusively from meteorites), magnesium sulfate (found only in certain caves in the Lesser Antilles islands), and calcium chloride (essence of limestone).<br /><br />****<br /><br />Amazon Vine Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.5 Liter, (Pack of 12), when bought in that quantity, amounts to 18 liters of water, which is 4.7551 gallons if you merely type "18 liters in gallons " into Google, which weighs 39.701 pounds, which is extremely close to the 39 pounds 11 ounces you would expect from pure water according to Wolfram when you enter "18 liters water in pounds."<br /><br />It works well in a squirt gun, which I still think more people should carry around just in case.<br /><br />At room temperature Essentia works well as a rinse after you've shampooed your hamster or your parakeet, and it works just as well after you've shampooed your giraffe but it takes a lot more, which gets expensive compared to just using tap water through a garden hose, believe you me.  For this I subtract one star.<br /><br />****

review/text: Interesting water with a weirdly high pH (9.5). I liked the taste. Tried it after a hot day and it was nice and refreshing.<br /><br />I wouldn't necessarily drink it by the case load though since it has an awkward aftertaste and goes flat once the bottle is opened (I never realize water can go flat like soda).

review/text: It tasted very clean and pure, not unlike water. It tasted like I get out of my reverse osmosis water. I didn't feel any different than drinking normal pH balanced water, but I only had one bottle. But I did enjoy the taste!<br /><br />I think it is a tad overpriced at more than $2 per bottle. I would rather get a Dasani or a Smart Water at much less than this.

review/summary: The Water Myth
review/text: By now, you're among the millions of people drinking bottled water. If you aren't you may be among those, like myself, who filter their own water. It's a well-known fact that most of us don't drink as much water as we should. The reasons vary, but what it comes down to is taste.I like starting out with a certain amount and making sure it's gone by a certain time of day.<br />I like the 1.5 liter bottle because it's sturdy enough to hold and drink from when full and doesn't feel as though it will collapse like some bottles do. I got Essentia from the Amazon Vine program. I began drinking it and thought it was very nice. It tasted like water.<br />I decided a true test would be to compare it against the water I usually drink. Brita filtered water. The difference in taste was startling. I gave my fiance two glasses of water. One we usually drink and Essentia. He couldn't get over the taste and texture difference. I thought all water was smooth, but really, comparatively, this is smoother. Noticeably silky.<br />The difference was remarkable. Our filtered water didn't taste nearly as clean or as smooth as Essentia. I liked it a lot and the infusion of Electrolytes is a plus. I didn't feel a lift, or more energized per se, but while at work, my staying power and focus seemed more enhanced. I really need to rethink my water. As I suspected, they are not all created equal. I highly recommend this to anyone who drinks filtered or bottled water. If you don't believe me, I double dog dare you to compare it to what you are already drinking and let me know what you think.

This is great water for folks suffering from acid reflux, both my husband and father-in-law now reach for this water instead of a Tums. It also helps balance your bodies PH which helps with a whole host of other health issues. On top of that it is electrolyte infused and releases anti-oxidants.

review/summary: Water is water
review/text: I received one 1.5 liter bottle of this water from the Amazon Vine program and my husband is the one who drank it. He took it to work with him one day and saved it in the fridge to drink on his hour long commute back home in the afternoon. He said it was cool and refreshing like water normally is but that he didn't notice any kind of difference between it and any other bottled water brands he'd tried. He said the size of the 1.5 liter bottle was good in that it was plenty to drink but bad because it wouldn't fit into any of his car's cup holders. He said it would have been a good size to keep at his desk during his work day. But considering the rather high price of this water, I don't think we'll be buying any of it. I know there are a lot of claims made regarding the benefit of this specific brand relating to its pH, but I think all that might just be bogus. I don't know of any reason to choose this brand of bottled water over any other.

review/text: This was recommended by a friend who is into healthy water.  It does taste great, but I can't really tell the difference between it and other bottled waters. The pH levels are supposedly better for you, but I couldn't tell from trying it one time.  If you want to spend the money, it is good, but I think just drinking lots of water will provide you with essentially the same health benefits.
