review/summary: Healthy and taste good too!
review/text: If you are tired of food that is loaded with ingredients you cannot pronounced or possibly even digest, you should give the Larabar Food Bar a try.  Five ingredients:  dates, almonds, pecans, ginger, cinnamon and clove.  Nothing more and nothing less and the amazing bonus ... they taste good!  No added sugar, 6g of fiber and sodium free ....almost unbelieveable isn't it.

review/summary: No more sawdust!!!
review/text: I was surprised by these bars when they were provided as a snack while out on a sailing trip. These bars are soft & moist, and more like eating actual food than the typical nutrition bar. I am so tired of the bars that taste like sawdust, and am really tired of having to eat something dry and with oats if I want nutrition (mind you.. I actually like oats, but options are nice). I didn't consider myself a fan of dates, one of the main ingredients, but this is such a pleasent alternative that you will be serendipitously delighted.

review/summary: Can't live with out these!
review/text: Have to Love Lara bars!  The only raw, natural,delicious snack to be found widely at most groceries in our area, and in so many flavors!  No added sugar or salt!  They have only 3-5 ingredients each.  All raw (except the peanuts in the peanut butter flavors are roasted.) It is exciting to be able to have them in larger quantities at a significantly lower price.  Now we never run out!  I think I'm going to have to set them up on subscription to be automatically shipped monthly!  They arrive quickly and we take them everywhere and enjoy them.  Even my two year old loves them.  Perfect for when you are away from home or don't have time for a meal and don't want to consume something full of bad fats, sugar, and preservatives.  Three in our family are gluten intolerant.  It is very hard to find something gluten free when you are out and about.  These are naturally gluten free!

review/summary: Good Taste!! Good Price too!!
review/text: The bar is pretty good. Taste more like cinnamon than apple pie IMHO!!<br />The texture, to my surprise was pretty mushy, thick and had bits of almond throughout.<br />Very chewy and you can taste the real fruit inside. (just think of a few different dried fruits pressed together)<br />This was my first time trying bars like this as part of a new diet. I like the minimal ingredients used.(no chems)<br />I ate the Trio brand bars along side this one for comparison.<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because of personal preference. I like the more nutty, crunchy textures of the Trio brand.<br /><br />Overall, I think it was a good bar. Not high on cals pretty good on nutrients.<br />Looking for a good tasting vegan bar, this is a good one to try out.

review/summary: One of the better snack bars you'll find
review/text: I've now sampled four different varieties of LaraBar, and here's my main take on the lemon ones: if you like lemon squares, this is your bar.  The all-natural raw foods approach makes for a great snack bar - not over-sweetened, no sticky aftertaste, not too dry, and one bar was often the perfect mid-afternoon snack to carry me over until dinner - but the lemon flavor here is definitely not subtle.  I still enjoyed the box, but prefer the cherry pie or banana cookie flavors.

review/summary: Great Product, Great Taste
review/text: I read about the fat content on the Larabar site, which said: "What about the fat in L&Auml;RABAR? Plant-based fats are healthier than animal fats. The fat in L&Auml;RABAR comes primarily from nuts-all plant-based fats containing Omega 3 & 6 essential fatty acids, which have been proven to reduce LDL cholesterol and help protect the heart."  I read all the reviews before making this purchase and I was amazed at how misleading PEN PAL's, review was (they said: "LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES!").  It sounded scary.<br /><br />Olive oil is good for you, but no matter what, the calories from fat (9 calories per gram) are going to be the same whether it is from bad sources of fat or good sources.  The calories from this product are from good sources and that is what counts.  Everybody who has gotten to the point of good intelligence regarding managing their intake of food should be aware how to use good fats vs bad fats, good carbs vs bad carbs but this IS, in my estimation, a very healthy product and just as you would not put too much olive oil on your food, or overeat nuts, you won't binge on Larabars or anything else you know will have unwanted consequences.  I'd give these delicious bars a try and fit them into your food management routine any way you see fit!  It definitely goes in the good food category for sure.  Don't hate the fat, hate the lack of discipline and they are a tempting yummy. :)

review/summary: Delicious Snack/Energy Bar without Fake Sweetener Aftertaste
review/text: I'm on the go and trying to keep healthy and fit by making sure I eat at regular intervals. I tried the "energy" bars and "nutrition" bars, but they all have fake sweeteners with that nasty aftertaste. Saw these in the grocery store and picked up a few different flavours. WOW!! All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />I have now tried most of the Larabar flavours, and these are my favourite - very simple 2-ingredients, but they go great together.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar.

review/summary: Still Love 'Em
review/text: I am a food bar junkie. I found these at Whole Foods about 6 months ago, and eat them regularly. I still havent got tired of them. I basically eat them as a meal supplement. I look for bars that taste good, are low in saturated fat, high in fiber, high in protein, and low in things like corn syrup and sodium. The Larabar product meets all these criteria. They are kind of unusual in their consistency though whic hmay turn some people off. They are quite dense in consistency, and some flavors also have a "sticky" consistency. The flavors are potent fresh and generally good. They taste like they are really made of the "flavor" on the label. Cherry taste like an actual cherry. Banana tastes like actual banana, etc.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Larabar is the best Food bar product, followed by Clif Bar, followed by PowerBar Harvest.

review/summary: Best LaraBar flavor yet!
review/text: This is my new favorite Larabar. My only gripe is that it's hard finding the new flavor in stores. I love Larabars in general because of their amazing ability to weave a few simple ingredients into great-tasting, portable snacks. There's no strange chemicals added, just fruit and nuts. They're my go-to snack to keep in my bag for those times when gluten-free food is hard to find. And they're the most reasonably priced of their class.<br /><br />The PB&J flavor is great because it combines the tart bite of their Cherry Pie flavor with the richness of peanut butter. If you can get used to the idea of a PB&J sandwich in bar form, it really will remind you of the original.<br /><br />This flavor has only 4 ingredients, no added sugar (sweetened with dates) and a respectable 6g of protein (they range from 3-6g, I believe).

review/summary: Great Natural Taste!
review/text: I've reviewed a lot of these products, and most have some common flaws: Bad, "unnatural," or chemical-like taste (especially in the metallic after-taste), woefully stale, cardboard-like texture, high fat content, and relatively high price.<br /><br />Fortunately, Lara-Bars are perhaps the best tasting line of "nutritional bars" available. The apple pie version is nicely chewy, with a taste of rolled oats, cinnamon, raisin, and, of course, apple, though it's not as intense or satisfying a fruit flavor as their Cherry Pie bar.  The apple hits you especially in the aftertaste, which is very satisfying.  Perhaps a bit on the dry side, but neither boring or cloying, and without that awful artificial taste mentioned above.<br /><br />The ingredient list is all one needs to read to discover the "secret" of Lara's natural taste:<br />Dates, almonds, unsweetened apples, walnuts, raisins, cinnamon. That's it! This is absolutely unheard of in type of food! Go to any comparable product (e.g., Cliff, Balance, Promax, South Beach, etc.) and you will find a veritable mine of vitamin and mineral additives.  For that reason alone (OK, and the concomitant wonderfully natural taste), these stand leagues above the competition.<br /><br />Does this reliance on natural foods cost you in nutrition?  I don't know--that's one for doctors and dietitians. However, I can list the nutritional values here:<br /><br />In one bar, you ingest the following:<br /><br />One serving (45 grams) provides 180 Calories--90 of them from fat;  10 g, Total Fat, of which only 1 gram is saturated fat,  4 grams are monounsaturated, and 4.5 grams are polyunsaturated (no trans fat, although, interesting enough, those grams add only to 9.5);  NO Cholesterol; 5mg of Sodium: 280mg, Potassium; 23 grams, Total Carbohydrate. Of which 4 grams are fiber and 17 grams, sugar (all that fruit), and 4 grams of protein. IT also provides 1 gram of Omega-3 and 4 grams of Omega 6 fatty acids. The fruit content sums to 1 serving of fruit according to the USDA food guide pyramid (I'm reading all this off the wrapper).<br /><br />Vitamins: Vitamins A and C --0% (of the percent daily values, based on a 2,0000 calorie diet), Vitamin E -10%,  Calcium--6%, Iron--8%, Thiamin (B1) --4%, Riboflavin (B2)-8%, Niacin (B3)--4%, Vitamin B6--4% Folate--4%, Zinc--4%, Copper--15%, Magnesium--10%.<br /><br />Some additional information can be found at--where-else--larabar.com, a nice little website where interested foodies can read about the company philosophy. For those not so inclined to visit, I offer an excerpt:<br /><br />"Humm Foods, the creator of L&Auml;RABAR, firmly believes that the foundation of a healthy mind, body and spirit is derived from what you eat. And what you eat is healthiest and most satisfying when it's in a whole, natural state...<br /><br />HUMM FOODS [note: this is contrasted with "junk foods"] ... resonate with energy in a whole, natural state. When consumed, they cause you to feel vibrant and alive when consumed, they cause you to feel vibrant and alive.<br /><br />You can expect an unmistakable urge to humm after every L&Auml;RABAR  you eat.<br /><br />Let the humming begin!"<br /><br />Writing like that tells me these people are--and I hate using this overused word--PASSIONATE about their product. Give it a try!

review/summary: Great for hiking or breakfast on the go
review/text: These bars are my favorite trail food. One makes a good breakfast. Two make a decent lunch while hiking. Not as sticky as Powerbars and Cliffbars, although I like those too.<br /><br />Others have commented that they are high in fat, calories and carbohydrates. What's wrong with that? These are not rice cakes, they are energy bars. The ingredients are: dates, almonds, unsweetened cherries. No added sugar. Non-gmo, gluten-, dairy- and soy-free. Vegan and kosher. No trans fat. One bar has only 3% of your recommended daily value of saturated fat. Healthier than lots of alternatives.<br /><br />Cherry and Lemon are great. Apple is almost as good. Pecan is just so-so. Haven't tried the other flavors yet.<br /><br />It's hard for me to believe that mold could grow on these because they are pretty dry.  Maybe it was crystalized sugar? My box from Amazon is labelled best by 12/2008, and they are all fine.<br /><br />I like these so much that I signed up for regular Amazon deliveries through Subscribe and Save.  Now I won't have to depend on Costco for a steady supply.  Keep up the good work, Humm Foods!

I LOVE that- all I taste are gently sweet dried fruit and nuts, not sugary crap that gives me a tummy ache. All natural stuff. I think for many people with low ratings of this product regarding taste, that is their beef- "no flavor" when they are used to super sweet processed taste. These bars are great for people with any sort of intolerance for soy or gluten and make great snacks after a workout.

The Cherry Pie Larabar reminds me of the cherry pies my mother used to make.  They are not overly sweet (like the store-bought pies made these days) and the tart cherry flavor really comes through.  I must admit I had my doubts when I first opened the wrapper, because the Larabar did not look very appealing.  Don't let looks fool you...this bar is delicious!!<br /><br />I first purchased a variety of Larabars at a local store to try them out.  Once I found the Cherry Pie bars, I decided to purchase a whole box of them through Amazon to save money.  An unexpected bonus was that the bars I received through Amazon.com were much softer (and fresher) than those bought locally.

It's refreshing to read a package label that you can pronounce, understand, and visualize each ingredient.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are Coconut (SO YUMMY), Lemon (tastes like a lemon square, very tart), and Banana (tastes freakishly like banana bread).<br /><br />These bars will satisfy your sweet tooth and keep you feeling full.

review/text: Another great LaraBar.  My favorite by far is the cherry, but I have not had a bad bar yet.  This is just like eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  A bit more calories than the others, but anything with peanut butter will be.  Still great nutritionally.

review/text: These are the best bars made by Larabar.  They really taste like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and they are not as sweet as the other bars.  I prefer them because I dont feel like I have eaten a candy bar and they keep me full like a sandwich would for hours.  I would highly recommend them to anyone especially gluten free people who need something to travel with or just go shopping and fit in a purse.

review/summary: A PURE "ENERGY" BAR
review/text: If you are into "energy" or "protein" bars, please try the Lara Bars. They contain no more than 6 ingredients such as walnuts, almonds and cashews to provide protein and the "good fats" as well as such fruits as dates, bananas, cherries and apple which give your body the carbohydrates it needs for energy. Compare them to any other bar on the market and you will see how the short list of simple ingredients adds up to great nutrition as well as great taste.

Yum!<br /><br />I was pretty pleased by the taste of my first purchases, and I liked these a lot, too.<br /><br />The taste of these is a bit tart (it's lemon, after all), but sweet at the same time.<br /><br />The texture is very soft, but with the tiny crunch of minced nuts.<br /><br />Excellent!

review/text: Lara Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Cashew Cookie, is the most delicious food bar I have ever tasted.  Besides being so yummy, I love the fact that it's RAW and therefore all the nutrition from the dates and cashews is kept intact.<br /><br />I always keep extra bars in my car or purse so that these tasty bars are always available to satisfy my hunger wherever I go.  One bar will keep me going for one to two hours, which is a blessing when I can't eat a regular meal.

review/summary: My favorite energy bar
review/text: This is my favorite energy bar.  Most of the time I prefer to eat real food, but there are occasions (long hikes, motorcycle trips) when it is more convenient to stash a small energy bar that is not damaged by extreme temperatures or being squished, and does not need anything else for preparation or clean up.  I also will frequently throw one in my purse if I am going somewhere for the day like a fair or expo where I'm not sure if there will be anything to eat besides hot dogs and nachos.  I like that there are not any artificial flavors or colors, no ingredients I cannot pronounce or have to look up in a dictionary, and no preservatives.  This is my favorite flavor, followed closely by the lemon.

review/summary: Not good anymore
review/text: I was a HUGE fan and recommended it highly.  However, I just tossed a whole box.  Something has changed -- and not in a good way.  I had concerns last year and thought maybe the taste was "off" just on the one box.  So I picked up another box last week.  It's even WORSE!  Since General Mills bought LaraBars (Humm Foods) three years ago, the product just seems to have gone down hill.  It doesn't have the same fresh, alive taste; there is a harsh, metallic flavor that indicates whatever machinery produces the bar now is not being properly cleaned.  Also the bar didn't used to be so oily to the touch.  Oily, weird flavors in nut bars make me think the nuts have gone rancid.<br /><br />Since I am writing, I also want to say it has bugged me for years that AMAZON continues to misrepresent the maker of LaraBars in the title of the product "LaraBar" by "LaraBar".  I suppose this is because people who generally buy raw food product are not usually the same people who support multinational food conglomerates like General Mills.  But it just makes me think that Amazon thinks consumers are ignorant.  I feel insulted every time I see it.

review/summary: Some Amazing! Some Not So Amazing...
review/text: It took me a long time to try these larabars out and I don't know what really prompted me to try one finally but I am so glad I did.  From the flavors that I have tried some just blew me away while some really left me feeling unsatisfied in the flavor department.  I will rate the ones out of 5 stars that I have tried, 1 being terrible and 5 being so delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cookie- 5 stars for this one, so delicious!!!  It tasted just like peanut butter cookie dough but made with crunchy peanut butter due to the nuts that are not ground up.  Such amazing texture and taste, it actually is better when left in the sun to warm up.  The flavor comes out so much better and texture too.  This has to be my favorite so far out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Pecan Pie- 5 stars for this one.  I am not a pie person at all, and pecan pie would never be my first choice but after having this larabar I am hooked on its flavor.  It tastes just like pecan pie, no kidding.  It's so strange how such simple ingredients can taste like the real thing.  It has a very deep flavor, almost a caramel molasses flavor.  There are nice pieces of pecans and almonds but not too many to overwhelm the bar itself.<br /><br />Peanut butter and jelly- 4 stars for this one.  It tastes just like that stuff called goober where there is peanut butter and jelly in the same jar.  I grew up eating that stuff and it's so much fun to be able to get that same flavor with this larabar.  I only gave it 4 stars though because it tends to get really tart due to that unsweetened cherries but still really delicious.<br /><br />Apple Pie- 2 stars for this one.  This was such a forgettable flavor, it was too tart in my opinion to taste like apple pie and they were really heavy on the cinnamon.  Don't get me wrong, I know that they are not suppose to really taste like the title says but it still is my least favorite out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Cherry Pie- 3.5 stars for this one.  This actually does taste like cherry pie but does taste like the filling of a cherry pie. I bet if they were to add cashews it would lend more of a buttery crust like taste but maybe not.  While this is a nice change every once in a while it is not one that I would get excited over.  Very tart but I love the ratio of nuts they used.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough- 0 stars, and yes I can give zero stars if I want.  This bar I took a bite out of and was so turned off by the taste.  Way way too sweet due to the chocolate chips used.  I love the larabars because of the no added sugar but by them adding chocolate chips which contain way too much sugar in my opinion really ruined this bar.  If it were not for the chocolate chips I think that it would have been better.  Unsweetened cocoa powder would have been better.  If you like almost candy bars but want a healthier option then you would like this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie- 5 stars for this bar.  This I was worried about trying because I am not really a fan of cashews to begin with but I want to try all of these bars, most of them anyways.  I was so surprised at how scrumptious this bar was.  It was not too sweet at all and the cashews lend such a wonderful almost buttery like flavor.  There is no added salt but I felt as though there was a nice saltiness to this bar.  This is my second most favorite after the peanut butter cookie larabar.  I like this one on days when I do not want any strong flavors and nothing too sweet and this one fits the bill.  I have never had a cashew cookie or heard of them but I can imagine they wouldn't be as good as this bar.<br /><br />I plan to try more so I will update this review soon.

review/summary: banana cookie goodness
review/text: I don't typically like banana flavored stuff. I'm not that crazy about adding bananas in my shakes. But this banana cookie bar is FREAKIN AWESOME. It is so delicious. I share them with friends all the time and the only friend that didn't like it just had a thing about not liking dates (and the ONLY three ingredients in this bar-o-goodness are: almonds, dates, and unsweetened bananas). THANK YOU LARA FOR YOUR DELICIOUSNESS IN A BAR. Just as tasty as it is nutritious ... and THAT is somewhat difficulat to find in "ready to eat" foods.

review/summary: Larabars Cocoa Mole
review/text: Very good; very satisfying.  Interesting blend of flavors--dried fruit, cocoa, chili.  Nothing dominates - all the flavors are well balanced to make it interesting to eat.  I couldn't eat one every day, but for an occasional meal replacement, it is very good.  Too high calorie to be a snack item, but it's tempting.

review/text: These bars are normally good but the shipment we got was moldy and inedible.  Amazon's customer service was very helpful, agreeing to send a replacement box without requiring us to send the bad bars back.  Unfortunately the second shipment was every bit as moldy as the first.<br /><br />I would not order from this vendor again until they get their act together.

You get the coconut that hits your taste buds first...then you are instantly smacked with an aftertaste of *SOAP*!  Terrible.  I tried 3 bites to see if it got better...NO.  I'd never recommend this although I do like other flavors.

review/text: I liked the fact that this product has a simple ingredient list and I could find gluten and dairy free protein bars.  So after hearing much about these, I decided to try them.  I tried various flavors, but still I just don't like them.  The texture is probably the worst part, I just find it gross and gummy.  As for taste, they're rather bland.  I think there are better tasting healthy options out there.  As for me, I won't be purchasing these again.

I think the cinnamon flavor is a little strong, but otherwise they taste like dates & nuts. That's great, if that's what you're going for. I'm a bigger fan of the lemon flavor ones. They have a good strong lemon flavor without being too sweet.

review/summary: Great bar, but don't expect fruit in every bite!
review/text: We really like Lara Bars.  We originally purchased our first ones at Whole Foods, mainly because the ingredients list is very pure and simple.<br /><br />When you eat these bars, don't think fruit first, think nuts then fruit.  Then when you hit the chunk or bit of fruit its a nice suprise.  Don't get us wrong, these are great... but there is a marketing difference in "Banana Cookie" vs. "Banana Nut Bread" for instance.<br /><br />Definately worth picking up, especially at Amazon prices/shipping.

review/summary: Misnomer
review/text: "Cherry Pie" is certainly a misnomer, even to those not used to traditional sweetness. Yes, the first ingredient in (all) Larabars is dates, and here it's very evident. Certainly a nutritious enough snack, but the cherries and almonds are pretty subtle and the flavor isn't top-notch.<br />Apple Pie is tasty and available on clearance from Target quite often.<br />Chococonut Chew tastes like chocolatey dates, as evidenced by the coconut as the final ingredient and dates as the first. Almonds overpower your mouth and the taste.<br />Cashew Cookie tastes just like a solidified version of my homemade cashew butter; would not invest in such a thing. Overly salty and bland, and a pretty hideous thing, too.<br />Pecan Pie is alright but certainly not a buy-twice.<br />Same w/ PB Cookie, which tasted more of peanuts than anything resembling a PB cookie.<br />PB & J<br />Coconut Cream Pie is atrocious, tasting like coconut oil and absolutely no cream component.

review/summary: not straightforward about allergen information
review/text: My daughter is extremely sensitive to gluten so many products that promote themselves as gluten free prove to be otherwise when my daughter has a gluten reaction.  For the sake of keeping my daughter healthy I contact companies asking them if they test for gluten and if gluten is processed in the same facility.  If it is then it is almost certainly contaminated.  Most companies give me a detailed and open answer so that I can make the best decision for my daughter.  They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not.  They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision.  Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer.  They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing.  They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels.  They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so.  So Larabar is attempting to deceive me.  They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars.  Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful.  I was so turned off by Larabar's response that I want nothing to do with them.  It was obvious they could care less about my daughter's health.  Ultimately, they put their profits above children's health.

review/text: As someone on a low sodium diet I have to make many types of food which most people buy, such as applesauce,bread, ricotta,and granola. I think these bars-and other Larabar flavors- taste 'chemical' to the point that they verge on artificial, despite being haled as all natural.  "Natural" does not equal tasty,and it often means nothing important. Besides tasting better,I wish the sodium levels were more readable - and lower.Sure fat,sugar and protein are all important,but more people die of cardiac disease and hypertension -linked to high sodium in the diet- than from lack of protein.

review/summary: DISGUSTING with a Capital D
review/text: Why put unsweetened ingredients in one of these bars? Unsweetened chocolate? Disgusting. This product lacks flavor and is way too heavy and dense. I also don't know what could be nastier than unsweetened coconut. It needs to be lighter in texture and a lot sweeter (not cloyingly so) and then this might be at least tasty. As it is, it is a waste of money and an absolute disappointment.<br /><br />To the manufacturer: look for inspiration in the flourless chocolate cake sold at Trader Joe specifically for gluten free diets, and check out the flavorful almond horn by Aleia. Both are mildly sweet, but full of flavor.  The chocolate flavor pops in the mouth and makes you forget that it has no gluten in it.  The almond horn delights you with the fragrance before it ever hits your mouth.  Both go great with tea, coffee and fruit, particularly the cake goes well with fresh stawberries.<br /><br />Maybe you just need to stick to a core ingredient and work around it.  There is too much nastiness going on in this disgusting bar.<br /><br />This is a terrible product that cannot be recommended. There are just way too many nasty gluten free products on the market, and this should be placed exactly where I just put it, in the garbage. More $$ down the drain and continued disappointment reigns.<br /><br />I am being brutally honest because I was recently diagnosed with a gluten allergy and have exceedingly fond memories of all of the delicious wheat-based offerings I used to eat and I naturally expect to be able to partake delicious gluten-free substitutes, espcially since they usually cost twice as much as the products containing gluten. This is no substitute for the wheat-based version, to say the least.

review/text: Everyone in my family shares my opinion that these things taste absolutely HORRIBLE.  I feel really bad for someone who needs to eat Gluten/Dairy/Soy-free or Vegan/Kosher foods.  If I had to live on these alone (and I don't), I'd convert back to being a non-vegan or whatever.  We all tried the Cherry Pie flavor, and what this thing has to do with cherry pies is way beyond me.  It's a lump of semi-solid goop with some nuts and dried fruits that taste sour and bitter and somewhat sticky.  Simply gross to the point I couldn't even finish one bar.  I may not be a health food nut, but I know what tastes like crap when I taste it...and these things are crap all the way. Steer clear.  Even 1/2 hour after, I still have that horrible taste in my mouth and need to go brush my teeth to get rid of it.

review/text: It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong. I lost it gradually and within recommended weight loss recommendations (1-2 lbs a week). I didn't starve myself, stop my social life for any diet's decrees, and I definitely wasn't under the tutelage of any one diet. I have done that already and realize a few things: 1) you must exercise daily, 2) you must mind calories, 3) you must eat 3 meals and 2 snacks every day, and 4) the types of nutrients matter (omega 3, 6, and 9 fats, thermogenic herbs, antioxidants, etc.)<br /><br />The greatest myth I busted was any form of perfectionism. If you have a candy bar once in a while, that doesn't mean you are a big failure, you have to start all over, and you might as well do that next week (so you can binge in the meantime).<br /><br />All diets are perfectionistic. They focus on one aspect of healthy eating and run with it to fit the lose-weight-overnight / Can-I-also-have-a-pizza-with-all-the-fixings? mentality of the typical deluded American. That's why we have the Atkins diet, illustrating the worst of this concept. However, these diets aren't bad, because you can extract a jewel of knowledge from each of these regimens. Atkins taught us to watch carbs and not to fear protein (although that doesn't mean you can eat bacon); Fat Flush teaches you the difference between good and bad fats, thermogenic herbs (that raise the metabolism), and a very basic understanding of the Glycemic Index, and Thurmond teaches you what combinations of foods work to lose weight and the power of eating many small meals throughout the day.<br /><br />Larabar is another great example of the focused diet. The jewel is the omega fats 3 and 6, gluten-free, no dietary sweeteners (which increase your appetite and studies have correlated artificial sweeteners to weight gain because of its high glycemic index count), and it being all natural, organic, and kosher. That's great, when you focus on only this aspect. But still, however popular diets have become, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and the like can never be ignored. The one irrefutable truth is the calories you take in determine what your weight will be in the immediate future. If there is a high fat percentage, which are calories still, you have to consider that.<br /><br />LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES! These health bars are healthy, but I would only have them as a reward before or after a good workout. This is the first review that I am rating this low because of the padding I suspect going on. One reviewer talks about the low calories, which is totally false. Two reviewers talk about how healthy it is, sounding very close to an infomercial as he focuses on only one aspect but ignores another. The suspicion arises when these two reviewers rate this bar 5 STARS 3-4 FREAKIN' TIMES WITH THE SAME WORDS! They must mention the excessive calories and fat in these bars, or else someone's going to go off of insufficient information and eat one every day with a sedentary lifestyle. Compare this bar to a Snickers, and you may have a different perspective. What is labeled "healthy" can be very bias.<br /><br />MY POINT BEYOND LARABARS: You can't focus on one system of ideas, because health and nutrition and weight loss are much larger and much more demanding concepts of nature's effect on the body. It's how you sustain and develop habits and balance in life, and it's about the knowledge you keep in your head, so you can deftly cut corners through increasing your metabolism or burning the maximum calories. It's about myth busting. It's about making smart choices. It's about knowing what choices are in the first place; if you choose one path, you can't choose another. Sacrifices may be what your particular body requires to be healthy and lose weight. You won't find a real chili-dog diet. You won't find a sugar that tastes exactly like sugar. One path leads to one place, while the other path leads to another. Note the difference, and be realistic.<br /><br />Lastly, the only health change you can make overnight happens in your head, not in your body.

review/text: I am a marathon runner and diabetic.  I have spent years tinkering with different energy/meal bars and eventually settled with ClifBar--which is not bad, though it has many sugary ingredients like rice syrup, etc.  I was extremely excited to discover LaraBar, it is delicious, contains no added sugars and provides an excellent source of energy for training.  Definitely the best bar on the market!
