review/summary: My dog loves these
review/text: My dog has food allergies so it's hard to find snacks for her since she can't have biscuits or meaty treats. She loves these!! The are dried so they can be a little tough to chew so they might not be great for older dogs, but my yellow lab loves them (she's about 4 years old). These treats are highly recommended. She eats one almost every day as her night time snack.

review/summary: Another favorite snack of my dogs
review/text: For them, they just like how they taste.  For me, I like the fact that they have the glucosamine added to them, and that they are just very basic food, chicken and sweet potato.  I would have given this 5 stars if it was made in the US.  I'll probably always, now, be somewhat suspicious of any pet foods or snacks that are made in any part in China.  My older dog is very creaky and arthritic, and so far we haven't found anything that helps ease her pain, so I can't attest to the healing properties of the glucosamine/chondroitin in these snacks, but I figure it can't hurt to feed her foods that contain them.

review/summary: My dogs favorite treats
review/text: Dogswell brand treats are the best I have found. After the gluten scare I searched for natural ingredients treats and found these which he loves. Even though they are made in china they are continually tested here in the US for quality control and have always passed. My dog has alergies and with two basic ingrediants I don't have to worry. He is also a picky eater when it comes to treats and he takes these every time.

Seem to "perk" him up  that he gets around better.<br /><br />My daughter purchased this product at a local pet store (of course paid more) --my dog liked them that much lthat I searched on the Internet and found them alot cheaper than buying them locally.<br />Will be ordering  again, again and again.

review/summary: Our Dog Loves These Treats
review/text: Our vet told us to switch our dog to a treat that contained ingredients he hadn't had on a regular basis because we're working to determine what is producing an itchy allergic reaction.  So far it looks like he may be allergic to chicken and maybe corn, neither is in this treat.  Amazon has a better price on this than any other place that carries them. The only problem we have is now the dog tends to "guard" the hall chest where we keep the treats and gaze hopefully at anyone walking through.  :-)<br /><br />Our dog has been getting them for about a month.  While puppy-sitting, I also gave the same treat to my Mom's dog and my brother's dog.  They both went nuts for the treat too.  I'll admit that's not exactly a discriminating audience (they aren't finicky dogs) but it seems to be quite popular.

review/summary: Unhappy hips! supplied by AMAZON
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141OWXU">Dogswell Veggie Life Vitality Sweet Potato Chew Treats for All Dogs, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>A year ago these treats were perfect and my pooch loved them, "just what the doctor ordered". HOWEVER, the recent shipments have been of inferior quality, poor quality. The product is dried-up and as far as my dog is concerned, unacceptable. She refuses to eat the treats and walks away from them. While the expiration date is in 2012 the product has to be tossed, it is anything but fresh.<br /><br />What illuminates this even more is that the local pet store is now stocking these treats. At the pet store, the products look and are soft and well managed and loved by the pooch. Clearly the treats from the AMAZON vendor is without quality and may have been rejects.<br /><br />While the cost in the pet store is much higher, it is well worth it.  Proves that you get what you pay for. If  it is 'Happy Hips' that your dog likes go the pet store or perhaps AMAZON will find a quality supplier.

He loves them!!  In fact he has gotten to the point where he refuses other dog treats.  I love the fact that these are all natural and my only complaint is that it was a little pricey (over $7 per bag) and a little difficult to find.  Well, amazon took care of that!  They came quickly and were quite a deal.  I will purchase again and again.

review/summary: Dogs love them but ... seems to make them sugar high?
review/text: I have two young dogs, a dachshund (1yr) and  a chihuahua (6mths).  I use these to crate train them.  This treat seems to cause them to be overly excited and even after eating, they would go to extremes to try to get more.  Good motivator.  But I am not sure if it's the natural sugar from the banana. I have many different treats for them before but this treat seems to make them super "high" and they had to race many laps in the yard to get off that energy.  Maybe someone who has the same experience can comment on this observation.  Overall, I am satisfied with the price of the item.  I wish the pieces were a little smaller since they are about a quarter size (too big for my small dogs). Recommended not more than 2 pcs a day for small dog under 20lbs.

review/text: My dogs love the Dogswell supplements made from chicken, so I assumed they'd also like the sweet potato supplements.  Neither of them would eat it!  Even my aggressive chewing lab didn't like these.  They're almost impossible to chew (unless I soak them in boiling water for at least 30 minutes, which presumably would leech the nutrients from the chews).  When the lab first tried these, they cut her gums, and when she would leave pieces of the chew on the floor, if I stepped on them before noticing them, they'd cut my foot!  I noticed this about ALL the varieties of Dogswells Sweet Potato Chews.  I threw them all out.

review/summary: Great Substitute for Freebirds Chicken Apple Wedges When You Can't Find Them.
review/text: Our dogs love the Freebird chicken apple wedges, but the economic two-pound bag is too hard to find since I purchased them at here-today-gone-tomorrow Costco.  The small bags are a bit pricey BUT they're not made in China.  My brother always insisted that we only buy dog food made in the USA when we had our three labs.  Now I have a beagle and a blue heeler with my guy, and we are always trying to treat them for good behavior.  I found and buy these at Petco.  The bag has more content than the usual packs of Freebirds, and they like them as well, but I didn't realize until reading other reviewer comments where they came from.  Filled with condroitin and glucosamine for the mature dog with hip problems (the blue heeler), I thought I'd give them a try.  Though I don't see any distinct improvement in our 12 year-old Sydney's hips, I don't see anything detrimental either.  They come to the cupboard after coming in from outside or a bath just as before and gobble them down like a kid with candy.  The China factor makes me a little uneasy, especially at that price, but I see no ill effects thus far.  I asked my vet today what she thought, and she said that they're probably fine as long as they're not recalled, but the laws in China are less strict about what they put in their products.  It makes me wonder if I want to risk my dogs being a recall factor if that should happen, so use your own judgement.  All I know is that my own canines love them, and others here seem to have no problem with them either.

review/summary: Happy Hips makes happy dog
review/text: My granddog stayed with me while my son was deployed to Afghanistan, and I found these special treats for her. They seemed unique, and healthy, so I gave them a try. She loves them! I only give her one a day, after dinner as dessert. She knows what that word means, and will whine if I wait too long to give it to her. She is an older dog, and does have some joint issues, so I really like that these treats have glucosamine and chondroitin. Who knew that dogs like apples!

review/summary: I own a finicky shih-tzu!
review/text: I own a shih tzu that hardly eats anything, and as far as treats go will only eat Happy Hips and (groan!)- Snausages!  Unbelievable!  He'll turn his nose up at filet mignon, but will wolf down a Snausage!  Of course I would rather he eat something somewhat healthy and I have bought many 15 oz. bags of Happy Hips treats through local merchandisers for around $18.99 a bag (plus tax).  Comes to a little over $20 a bag.  Three 15 oz. bags through Amazon with shipping - around $35, vs. three 15 oz. bags through local retailers - over $60.  Same great product - do the math.

review/summary: Treats were stale
review/text: The Dogswell Happy Hips Sweet Potato Chews I bought from Amazon were stale.  I have bought these before, in local stores, and they are supposed to be pliable and "chewy".  Although the bags had expiration dates that were in code, each bag I opened, contained "stale" chews.  They broke like crackers and I could hear my dog chomping on them like a bone.  I buy them so I can bend them over and put them in her toys or bones - she can spend a lot of time trying to get at the "treat".  With these, all I could do was feed them to her like snack crackers.  I was very disappointed.  I will continue to buy them, as they are a good product, just not from Amazon.

But I still feel uneasy about giving it to my dogs. Why wouldn't they post this info on the bags then?????

review/text: I made the applesauce cake as described on the package (though I did not add the shredded apple) with cream cheese frosting, & had to go out & buy another package within 2 days to make another; I'm the only gluten-intolerant person in the house, but everybody went nuts over this cake.  It's so good I actually prefer it  without the icing, which is just about a first for me.<br /><br />I did add an additional 1/2 t or so of cinnamon, but otherwise the applesauce cake mix was perfect; the finished prodect had moist, dense texture (but not that lead brick denseness of many GF cakes), no trace of sandy texture (like many GF baked goods).  It rises beautifully, & is just all-round unbeatable.  I won a prize in a baking contest with a homemade applesauce/spice cake once, & that scratch cake (made with wheat flour) wasn't any better than this.

review/text: Absolutely love this cake mix as we have family members with allergies one to milk protein, and the other to wheat, corn, soy, peanuts and sesame and they can both eat this cake! Just wanted to mention that you can follow the mix or experiment with it too! We made a version of this cake  with carrots and raisins and used a shredded coconut based icing on the cake and it was wonderful. You can also make this cake and poke fork holes throughout the top of the cake. Then while the cake is still warm pour a mixture of 1 can coconut milk mixed with 2 cups sugar evenly over the top of the cake. Then let your cake sit overnight and it will crystallize and you have a very rich dessert.  Another thing we have tried was baking the cake mix until almost done and then mixing the cake up with a jar of cherry jam ,that had whole cherries in it, and a tablespoon of virgin coconut oil to make a rich cherry cobbler. We took the cobbler to a church covered dish and it was a hit!

So instead of 1 egg and 2 egg whites I used 3 tablespoons milled flaxseed and mixed that with 9 tablespoons warm water. Let it sit for about 10 minutes and that replaces the egg. It is a little healthier too. So yummy. My 4 year old who is allergic to corn, wheat, milk, eggs, soy, peanuts and fish was able to enjoy this with no problems at all! AMAZING!!!

review/text: We got a bag of this for free when my daughter was diagnosed with celiac disease. I made muffins using the recipe on the bag for applesauce cake, but subbed grated carrot for the grated apple, and added nuts. One bag of mix made 22 small muffins, if I remember correctly. They have a nice dense crumb -- sturdy but soft. (My daughter specifically said she liked that they didn't crumble apart.) And they hold up well to freezing and reheating.<br /><br />I thought the flavor would be too spicy for the kids, but the muffins got snarfed up in less than a week. It's the first GF product that my kids have eaten just as enthusiastically as if it actually contained gluten (and they didn't even complain that I didn't add chocolate chips). Even though we have two huge bags of another GF baking mix in the cupboard, I'm ordering more of this.

review/text: I almost always make the carrot cake version, adding a cup of shredded carrots and about half a cup of chopped pecans and raisins, and my guests -- who do not need to follow a gluten-free diet -- tell me it is the best carrot cake they've ever had.  My (non-celiac) husband agrees.  I used to find it locally, but ordered the six-pack from amazon.com after it was dropped from my store.  It has since been added back, though I still buy it here because, one, the local store is often sold out, and, two, I make it so often that it is worth buying six packages at once and at a lower price.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.

review/text: My friend requested a spice cake for her birthday. I try to avoid gluten and I originally was going to make her a gluten-containing cake, but it turned out mediocre so I threw it away.

review/text: This is a very smooth, slightly flavored coffee.  It doesn't scream at you to wake up.  It doesn't stand your spoon straight up in the cup when you pour in the cream.  You could realistically drink it black, but adding a shot of hazelnut or almond creamer just makes it that much better.  I buy Gloria Jean's coffee all the time and this is one of the best flavors to get.

review/summary: WEAK COFFEE!
review/text: Compared with about 20 other types of K-Cups I've test-driven in various samplers, this is one of the weakest.  Even making a "mug" size (medium setting, not large) in my Keurig produces a very weak cup of coffee.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavoring is superb as hazelnut flavorings go, and it's at the perfect taste level, but the coffee is substandard.<br /><br />If you want a hot cup of hazelnut, I'd suggest going with a better K-Cup coffee maker -- Timothy's, Diedrich's, Newman's, Coffee People, Green Mountain, etc. -- and then pouring in some Frangelico....  =)<br /><br />It's sad because Gloria Jeans has been around FOREVER and had tons of shops in the area I grew up in 30 years ago.  I hate to pan an old friend!

review/summary: Am I drinking the same blend as the 5-star reviewers?
review/text: I don't know how what I tried could be considered the same as what all the rave reviews are coming in for.<br /><br />When we got our new Keurig brewer for Christmas it came with a sample pack of 12 different coffees. We were excited for the opportunity to try different blends before purchasing an entire (pricey) box of any one flavor.<br /><br />To preface: I enjoy flavored coffees. French vanilla, mocha, hazelnut... Pretty much any variety available. I was really excited to try Gloria Jean's Hazelnut since it was one of the few flavored options in the sample pack. I typically enjoy smooth medium roasts and I can't stand bitter coffee with a pungent aftertaste.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this brew is without-a-doubt undrinkable. So bitter and thick. I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend. It smelled burnt as soon as it was brewed. We brewed an 8 ounce cup since typically flavored coffees tend to be weaker so we assumed brewing the smaller size cup would allow us to enjoy to most flavor. The coffee was dark in appearance and both my boyfriend and I tried it befor dumping it out in the sink because the taste was so foul.<br /><br />Aside from its burnt flavor and bitter aftertaste, it's also worth mentioning that I couldn't detect any hazelnut notes at all. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I'd never tried a Gloria Jean brand coffee before and now I'm nervous to try another. I might attempt the Butter Toffee flavor if I can find it in a small pack. But I'll avoid hazelnut from now on.

I have found other flavored k cups from other manufacturers, and I prefer them to this product and this company.

I really liked the amount of flavoring in the coffee, it was enough that I could taste it but not enough that I was overwhelmed.  I added Coffeemate's Coconut Creamer and the flavors work well together. It's makes a light to medium roast cup of coffee.  Not for the Starbucks coffee drinker, they would find this coffee too weak. But the occasional coffee drinker would love it. I would recommend.

review/summary: Best K-Cup Coffee I've Ever Tried
review/text: The other day, I put a cup of this coffee to brew and walked out of the room for a minute while it brewed.  When I stepped back into the room, it had that WONDERFUL coffee house aroma; you know, the kind that makes you want to get out a great book and sit with a cup of coffee.<br /><br />I've tried quite a few of the Keurig coffee blends.  This is by far the BEST coffee I've had on Keurig so far!  While it does have Hazelnut flavor, it's not overbearing -- it's a subtle hazelnut flavor.  This makes a PERFECT breakfast blend cup of coffee.  It has a smooth flavor.  It is NOT bold.  If you like bold strong coffee, this might seem weak.  However, if you like a smooth cup of coffee, this is wonderful!<br /><br />Enjoy!

Of all of the flavored coffees the Hazelnut blends are overwhelming the favorite. After some trail and error we settled on Gloria Jean's as having the best flavor and richness. I would suggest making an 8 oz. cup or smaller, especially if you are adding cream to it.<br /><br />I now purchase this in Amazon's Frustration-Free packaging. Their is 50 per package and I just rip the top off and stick and whole thing in my cabinet.

review/summary: Great Aroma & Taste, One of My Favorite K-Cups
review/text: If you like other flavored k-cup coffees, you will probably like this one.  This is one of my favorite k-cups.  I think it is a perfect balance of a lightly flavored coffee and superb aroma.  It has a very pleasant hazlenut aroma when it brews (stronger than some other flavors) and tastes like a great coffee with a light hazelnut taste.  This seems more like a medium roast than a light roast if you compare to other flavored coffees and I feel like it has a very nice coffee taste above all else.  I like medium coffees, so I think this one is great.  It isn't like drinking a shot of hazlenut flavoring or like drinking a strong starbucks coffee.  It is just a harmonious light flavor to a good medium coffee.<br /><br />Like other flavored coffees, you should only brew this on the normal default coffee cup size (6oz) on the Keurig brewer or you will water it down if you use the mug size or larger.
