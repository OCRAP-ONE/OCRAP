review/text: These are the only treats my puppy really loves along with "Milk-Bone Soft & Chewy Chicken Recipe Treats (37 oz)" that I also buy on amazon.com.  I get a huge bag of Zuke's Mini Naturals" and store them in a glass jar.  The "Milk-Bone" treats already come in a large jar.  I take the Zuke's along on walks for training and use them in the house for training and rewards.  I will continue to buy them and highly recommend them.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW">Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats Roasted Chicken Recipe, 16-Ounce</a><br /><br />Our six year old Rottweiler is an extremely picky eater for some reason and we've gone through no less than six different brands of treats over the past year and this finally hit the spot.<br /><br />We changed from mass produced big brand treats to healthier natural ones about a year ago and maybe it's just me but I see a real difference in energy when playing.  He simply loves these. They are pricey so we tend to be less ready to give treats but when we do it's great.  I'm almost tempted to try one.<br /><br />Very pleased with the response thus fur.

review/summary: Sad to see it go, even the cat was sold!
review/text: When my local pet store started giving out samples of the peanut butter mini's, I knew I was in trouble.  My 90 pound Akita was immediately obsessed with them and I knew we'd have to keep them in stock at all times.  I like the mini's because they're so low in calories, and she likes them so much she doesn't care how big they are.  The squares are great too because you can easily snap them into 4's and make your own mini's.  The funny thing is - my dog's cat totally loves them too!  I threw one on the floor for the dog, and her cat hauled tush to it, devouring it in seconds.  We had a new family game, I'd throw one inbetween them to see who wants it more ...<br /><br />Anyway, the super sad news is that, cat and dog can no longer fight to the zukes mini death.  My dog started having bowel issues - she'd get bloated and gassy, and have diarrhea at least once a day.  I seriously fought for this treat - I researched every dang ingredient in it to disprove of it being the cause and I'm here to tell you,  Zuke's is definitely giving us our money's worth.  But after 48 Zuke's free hours - her digestive disorders vanished completely.  It's not Zuke's fault and I am not at all bad mouthing their product, I still think it's the bomb.com!  I'm only sharing because I couldn't find one other person out there with the same unusual experience.  If it happens(ed) to anyone else, know that I'm jammin' some "Against All Odds" for both of us!

review/summary: Chicken Dog Treats
review/text: Our 10 month old mixed breed is a very picky eater. After trying a few different brands of dog treats someone suggested we try Zuke's because of the high protein and natural ingredients. Our puppy loves them!  The treats are small enough that I don't have to worry about breaking them up for training. There is a very strong smell with these treats, but it actually helps because our puppy comes running when I open the bag. I will be buying more flavors in the future.

review/text: My dog is a picky eater and will ignore some kinds of treats. However, she consistently and readily works for these peanut butter minis. The treats are quite smelly and break pretty easily into two. However, they tend to crumble if they become even slightly dry. On the whole, I would highly recommend Zuke's minis because they're the right size and have the right flavors to get my dog's attention!

review/summary: great for arthritis
review/text: I have been giving this oil to my 13-year old arthritic Siberian Husky for about 2 months now. He has been getting some type of fish oil for about a year. This oil has made the biggest and most noticeable difference in his mobility. With cheaper oils he improves but still needs occasional anti-inflammatories to keep him from limping and getting too stiff. With this oil he doesn't need the meds, and he has been moving easier and faster on our walks. He doesn't limp even after a 2-hour hike on hilly terrain.<br /><br />He also gets monthly Adequan shots - and it really seems to be the combination of the fish oil and the Adequan that keeps him moving at this level. But I definitely have noticed a difference with the different brands of fish oils I have tried. This and Nordic Naturals (the stuff for humans, not the kind for pets) have been the best by far. I highly recommend this product.

review/text: I've ordered these snacks twice. It was the second time around that I was very disappointed. Over half the bags were stale. I called the seller and they informed me that they did not accept returns. They had no real explanation for the stale product other than it's made weekly. They offered to send me a variety box of some of their other snacks in exchange. I had to follow-up with them 2-wks later when nothing showed. As indicated in title, the pork rinds are great if they are fresh. Be forewarned, there is a 50/50 chance the quality will not be as expected.

review/summary: Top of the line balsamic vinegar
review/text: I get this as a birthday or Christmas present every other year or so.  I was sad to see one user returned this unused and said it was a bad value.  It's true, it is not a value item.  It is however, a luxury item.  If you go to the grocery store and buy a $5 or a $10 bottle of balsamic vinegar and then taste this then you will understand the difference.  If you like Vodka, it is like the difference between a fifth of Popov's for $5 and a bottle of Grey Goose for $40.  If you are looking for value, don't buy this.  If you want something you can use on salads, breads, sandwiches, strawberries, or even ice cream, then this is the finest balsamic I have ever tasted.<br /><br />My last bottle went quicker than normal because I will not go back to normal salad dressing.  Yes it's that good.  I am going to buy some more today because the prices at Williams Sonoma can range from $24 to $50 for different brands.  Hope this helps.

review/text: I have become very fond of good balsamic vinegars over the years.  I have been using it on salads and some fruits and thought the one I used was the best I have tasted until my wonderful sister-in-law send me a bottle of Fini Modena Balsamic Vinegar WOW what a flavor! Yes, price is high but when you try it you will not go back to the $10 bottle or vinegar!  The old expression "You Get What You Paid For" is a perfect fit.  So, if price is the most important thing then by the grocery store vinegar but if you want the best and don't mind paying for it buy Fini's!  It is going to be in my pantry from now on.

review/summary: Hello Heaven
review/text: I love a good balsamic vinegar. I remember the first time I tried it with olive oil and amazingly delicious crusty bread. Years ago I moved to SoCal and my cousin took me to her favorite Italian restaurant. Our waiter brought out the bread basket and plates and my cousin requested that he make us a plate of olive oil and vinegar for us. I watched her as she dipped her bread in it. I thought I'd give it a try and see how I liked it.<br /><br />Oh heaven. How we love you so. Whenever I eat something amazing I feel like it's just a taste of heaven. And taking that first bite of bread with oil and vinegar was like stepping into heaven. Dramatic, maybe just a bit. But when something alerts all of your senses in a wonderful way -- isn't that what heaven is going to be like? (Mine is, anyway!)<br /><br />Cut to going to the store to buy olive oil and vinegar. Hmmmm... it's almost the same. But the vinegar is runnier and not as amazing tasting. In fact I stopped buying it for dipping in bread and just wait until I go out. I haven't been able to create at home the same experience. Until now.<br /><br />Welcome FINI Balsamic Vinegar.<br /><br />It is thick, it is rich and it is the perfect balance between sour and sweet. I add it to EVERYTHING. For example tonight I sauteed some greens and yellow bell pepper. To give it some added flavor I drizzled some of the Fini vinegar over it. It was amazing. Thank you Fini for adding to my veggies.<br /><br />It's sooooo good. And yes, put it with some amazing extra virgin olive oil and an amazing loaf of crusty bread and you too will have welcomed heaven into your life as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!

Meanwhile, he makes a trip to the mall to use some gift cards and returned delighted that he found it for half the price! Of course, by that time, my order had already been shipped!  Ergh!

I realized that I really needed to write a review to get the word out.<br /><br />We have a longhaired black cat. Her fur is really fine and sticks to all our furniture. This sponge works like magic to lift off the fur. It is such a simple design but works like a dream, much better than those sticky tape rolls and other things I have tried.<br /><br />Occasionally, I have friends with large dogs that ride in my car. The sponge also works well to remove their fur from my car's upholstery, so I am sure it would work well with dog hair in the house, as well.

review/summary: Not for everyone, but I love them!
review/text: I bought a box of these a few months ago at my local grocery store during my "let's try the many different varieties of Cheez-Its" plan.  At first I was unsure how I felt about the smoked ones, but after the box was gone I really craved them.  I love the Monterey Jack ones, but I love the Smoked Cheddar differently.  My brother didn't like the smoked ones, and it certainly depends on your personal taste.  I read a review here that said they taste like a campfire - that is sort of true, but not exactly a bad thing in my opinion.  They taste smoked because they ARE smoked.  If you do not like smoked foods (like my brother) you will not like these, and if you think the sound of smoked cheese sounds bad you really should try another Cheez-It variety.  These are (currently) my favorite Cheez-Its and I hope they continue to make them for a long time.<br /><br />As for the price here right now: that I give a 1 star.  My local grocery store sells these for about $4 to $5 a box (13.7 oz).  I only buy them when they are on sale, usually $2.50 to $3 a box.  The price from Amazon right now is $25 for 4 boxes of the same size, which makes these $6.25 a box.

review/summary: Smoked Cheddar
review/text: Cheez-its Duoz is a nice concept but this particualr variety is disgusting.<br />the smoked Cheddar tastes like cheese that is going bad and does nothing to complement the Monterey Jack. If only they picked a different flavor.<br /><br />Basically the smoked cheddar just ruins this otherwise good concept. The Monterey Jack just needs a new companion

review/summary: Great Taste! Not so good packaging..
review/text: The taste of these cheez-its are great! Love the variety all in one box!<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was that they were poorly packaged and all the boxes were dented, leaving a lot of the cheez-itz mashed up. You can probably find these for $2.60/box at Winco, so the pricing on Amazon really isn't that great.

review/summary: The coffee is great, but other buyers were right: mysterious punch hole
review/text: The coffe is really great, makes very aromatic, full bodied espresso.  I would just like to review the packaging more. I ordered several packs of these, packaged in bricks of 4, vacuum-packed, and covered with clear plastic. Very impressed because of the efficiency of packaging, very tightly packed. Of the 3 sets I ordered,  one set had one of the bricks with a punch hole at the bottom, seems mysterious since the clear plastic covering the 4 bricks was in no way punched and remained intact. It's just the one brick with the punch hole at the bottom. I wonder how it got that way. Anyway, this would have been 5-stars but for that. Highly recommend the coffee.

After Senseo stopped making their pods, we bought the Coffee Duck/Ecopad pack from Amazon but weren't sure which coffee to use in them.  Tried the Crema e Gusto based on high reviews and are happy we did! Best cup of coffee from our Senseo machine ever!  Much smoother and lower acidity than the Senseo coffee we were used to, and can get some nice crema when using the Ecopads. Price can't be beat, either!

review/text: I bought this to use with a 3 cup espresso maker.  This stuff seems to last quite a while, even though I fill up the holding dish to the top.  The espresso tastes great and in my opinion (if you flavor it right) is just as good or better than many of the coffee products that you can purchase that are made for you (aka starbucks, caribou, etc).  Buying it in the 4 pack also brings down cost quite a bit.<br /><br />Overall, a great product and highly recommended.  It is a very bold flavor, so if you aren't in to dark and bold coffee then beware.

review/text: Guys:<br />Although the price recently went up, I received this 4-pack for $12 shipped (using Subscribe and Save and an Amazon clipless coupon).  Although it has a very high concentration of robusta beans (60 or 70%) instead of the market-favored arabica beans (40 or 30%),  it's the robusta beans which produce such an excellent creamy and rich crema, from both my stove-top espresso maker and my Nespresso machine (I fill my own home-made capsules with this brand...see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UP1M4I">Ne-Cap Nespresso� Compatible Refill Capsules</a> ), and the espresso is absolutely perfect. No bitterness, just rich, dark and flavorful. Would buy again if it goes on sale (the Amazon price is still better than NYC supermarkets which sell one pack for $4.75),

We always prefer to grind our own beans but we like to have a backup that is pre-ground for company so we can quickly make espressos without a lot of waiting between cups. We've tried several Lavazza pre-ground and all are pleasing, this is no exception. you aren't taking any chances here, except for a slightly higher-than-prefered price.

review/text: I love this espresso coffee, it makes such a nice cup of espresso with an amazing crema.  It's very consistent and the flavor is smooth, however I have noticed that I get a major headache after drinking an espresso made with this coffee.  I am making it properly with the right amount of coffee so I know it's not that.  It's also not the caffeine since I drink drip coffee almost every day.  That leaves really one thing which is the robusta beans that is blended with arabica to make this coffee.<br /><br />Great coffee, just not for me and if anyone else experiences this then it's the robusta beans so just try another 100% arabic blend, it comes out good anyways.

review/summary: Great Coffee, Honey!
review/text: I was enthralled with the coffee I was served in Florence, Italy years ago and brought some home.  Now, it's available in the U.S. and it's Lavazza.  My local market used to sell it and no longer does but amazon comes through for us.  The flavor is intense but not harsh and has a slight mocha flavor (at least to my untrained palate).  The only negative is my own fault by not noticing that I was ordering a 4-pack, so I have more than I need.  After giving one away to someone who probably won't appreciate it, I'm going to keep the rest and transport myself back to Florence every morning.  The grind is fine enough for an espresso maker but also works for drip makers, although you should use less than usual at first.  It's pretty strong.  Americans are inundated with choices of coffee these days, but I highly recommend trying Lavazza if you're a regular coffee drinker.  The price was very reasonable, even with the shipping.  Share the cost and product with 3 friends at first to give it a try.<br />Ciao

review/summary: Best espresso ever!
review/text: I used to buy only coffee that I could grind in the supermarket since I wanted the best possible espresso from my machine. However, I just moved to an urban area where I am unable to grind my own coffee conveniently (outside my home). So I searched on Amazon and found this coffee, which has excellent reviews. I figured it couldn't be better than freshly ground coffee, but that it was better than getting some old gross coffee from the convenience store across the street. Much to my and my boyfriend's surprise, this coffee makes much better espresso than any other coffee we have tried over the past few years (and we have tried many, including expensive coffee from Whole Foods). I don't know about the other blends from this brand, but if you like strong rich espresso, this one is AMAZING. Try it, and you'll see.

review/text: I bought this on a whim after some sporadic experience with an old, trusted roaster....  This is a very nice new taste for me.  It's a bit lighter roast than the two espresso roasts that I have been using.  It's got a nice, delicate taste that asks to be made on the strong side to show its best character.  I haven't bought ground coffee in many years, so this whole experience was a bit of a lark for me but I'm glad I tried it.  I'm using in a LaPavoni machine and a Moka rig and they're both working well with the grind as arrived.

review/text: This is a dark, chocolaty cofee. Grind works well in my stovetop espresso maker. I have tried many different espresso blends and was not sure how this would be since it is a blend of robusto and arabica beans but it is rich, dark, and as others have remarked, not at all acidic or bitter. My new favorite.

review/summary: Excellent espresso mix
review/text: I was an avid fan of the Lavazza Cafe Espresso (black can) for years.  I was about to sign up for the subscription service for this product on Amazon.com when I started reading the reviews about the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. One of my main concerns is if the acid in a coffee will give me an upset stomach.  The Cafe Espresso didn't at all, so I was leery to switch to something else.  I figured I'd give the Crema e Gusto a try and if it was too much for my stomach, I'd switch back.  No worries.  Not only is this a smooth blend, it has a richer taste than the Cafe Espresso.  I won't need to switch back!

review/summary: You have to try this!
review/text: I have always loved the coffee in Italy and it's the only place where I consistently drink cappuccinos - no bitterness, bite or overwhelming strong flavor, just great coffee.  Until we decided to give this coffee I try, we were unable to duplicate that Italian espresso flavor.  Now we can!  We've given up all of our other gourmet espresso blends and drink only this in our lattes, cappuccinos, mochas and Americanos.  And everyone we've shared this coffee with has done the same!  Try it - I'll be surprised if you're disappointed!

review/text: If you are avid coffee espresso drinker look no further. This coffee comes perfectly pre-ground for espresso drinks. This espresso has a smooth rich flavor that is not too strong with a hint of a chocolate aftertaste. Warning after you drink this coffee a couple of times you will be hooked. If I had to compare this to Starbucks latt&eacute;'s, the Lavazza has a more refined and smoother flavor without the bitter burnt taste that Starbucks has.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />John S.

review/text: I tied Lavazza at a coffee house in Milano and really enjoyed the taste. It doesn't have the bitterness that you find in almost all coffee houses in US. It is very full flavored coffee. I couldn't find it in US, not even at small European food stores. I searched online and Amazon has the best deal if you sign for regular delivery. You don't have to spend $300 to $400 for an espresso machine when you have an excellent quality coffee.

review/text: We originally purchased the Lavazza Crema y Gusto coffee pack when it went on sale, but I am re-ordering at full price because of the taste.<br /><br />Not sure if it's the blend or the roast, but it's a superior coffee by every measure. Flavor is full and robust, but not at all bitter. It's hard to describe it's smoothness without hyperbole, but try it once and you'll find yourself at a loss for words also. If you are used to the strength of a French press but want the silky smoothness of a breakfast blend, this coffee is for you.<br /><br />Vacuum packed into foil bricks for freshness. Do yourself, your spouse, and your office mates a huge favor and give it a try - and be prepared to start writing your own five star review.

review/summary: fancy coffee shop taste and smell
review/text: one day recently, i purchased this crema e gusto lavazza when it was on sale, because i know my friend uses lavazza in his espresso-maker, and i thought i'd break out the moka maker again.  well.  holy cow.  i had forgotten what good coffee tasted like, based on my steady kcup habit.  i can barely taste my keurig kcups now, which seem fairly bland, or too sharp, or too...something else wrong in comparison. i'll still use my keurig due to the convenience, and perhaps i'll try using lavazza in my keurig as another review mentioned.  But, i think you cannot go wrong with a stove top moka of this stuff.  it is not bitter, it is not sour, it has no off notes-- just extremely rich and heady, a good hefty body and smoothness that can't be beat.  the outrageously excellent aroma permeates the house like a great coffee shop you might step into.<br /><br />i read some of the bad reviews, and i can't understand the negative comments, just as they can't understand the good reviews--taste is individual i guess!  But, i LOVE this coffee!  it's extremely good, and i will even drink it late in the evening despite the caffeine, due to the wonderful flavor. crazily, i find myself looking forward to a quiet weekend morning to indulge, just like you might see on some goofy ad where a woman with closed eyes is smiling in dreamy wonder while sniffing a cup. try this coffee- maybe you'll be lucky to be in the majority for whom this rings all the bells.<br /><br />update: i tried the Lavazza in the Keurig, and it just does not do it justice in comparison to the stove-top moka method. but, it still tastes better than regular k-cups.<br /><br />update 2: i tried this in the Aeropress (french drip type) machine that had over 1000 great reviews here on Amazon, and i have to say, this combo will be my only go-to coffee from now on.  the Aeropress, in addition to being easier to use than stove top, seems to make a less burnt flavored and more creamy brew.  this, combined with condensed sweetened milk (like the Vietnam-french drip type)is heavenly. i'm buying a second Aeropress to have this combo at home in addition to the office.

review/summary: wonderful coffee, the best, easy on the stomach
review/text: It is not have a bitter taste as a few have suggested.  I always use a melitta cup for making any espresso coffee and this one is just delicious.  I checked my ph strip and it does not register as acid.  It doesn't bother my stomach at all and I am super sensitive to anything acid.  American coffee I have a hard time tolerating; the Italian and Kenya coffees that are dark roast espresso are thought by some people via their processing techniques and quality to be alkaline.  It makes the American coffee look like junk for how the body responds and the taste. Once you have had this coffee you won't want American coffee anymore.<br /><br />In case anyone is wondering what a melitta cup is, it is a cone made from plastic or ceramic (mine is ceramic) and it has a hole at the bottom.  I adjust the coffee filter to fit it and then put the espress coffee in it and then pour my hot water from the tea kettle into it.  I add a little nut milk into the coffee and I am ready to enjoy a wonderful taste.  It beats dealing with a coffee maker any day.  Each person in the family can have their own melitta cup as it is so quick to do.
