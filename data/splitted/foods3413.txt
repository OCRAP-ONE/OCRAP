review/summary: Better than US Instant Coffee
review/text: A friend who has gone to Korea gave me a couple packs to try. I found that it was much smoother and less bitter than US instant coffee, but also thought it was a little weak. I used a regular-sized coffee cup, so perhaps it's larger than the ones they use in Korea? Will try my next pack using a smaller cup size to see how that changes it. I normally use Sweet-n-Low in my drinks, and would prefer to do that in this, as well, to save on the calories, but for a quick coffee when my Kureg isn't available, it's pretty good.

review/summary: This white truffle salt smells good but I wonder if it is a natural flavor or not?
review/text: I love truffle flavor salt. I have used a couple of different brands of black truffle salt that have been quite good. The salt has been mixed with little black truffle bits that are very visible.<br /><br />I came across this white truffle salt and thought I would try it. I must admit, it smells like truffles but I don't see any truffle bits in the salt. That made me wonder whether there is real truffle in this salt, or if it is a chemical concoction. All the label says is "Italian White Truffle Flavoring." No where does it say it is natural flavoring. This is quite expensive salt and understandable if it is made from real white truffles. But if it isn't, ???<br /><br />Until this question is settled, I would recommend caution in the purchase of this product.

review/summary: stinky poop
review/text: I wanted to get this food because the price is more reasonable as compared to my cat's normal food, Science Diet Indoor Formula. I bought a small bag to try it out, and I'm glad I did, because I'm not buying it again for the fact that it makes my cat's poo ridiculously smelly! Even though I clean the litterbox near daily, wipe it down with cleaning wipes, use sanitizing spray on it, and have an air purifier clsoe to it, I can STILL smell when he has gone to the bathroom. The cleaning combination was effective when he was on Science Diet.<br /><br />If it doesn't make your cat's poop smell something fierce, then this is a great deal. The product has good, all natural ingredients, and is inexpensive compared to the other brands.

review/summary: OMG, this stuff is so good!
review/text: If you like Asian food, and you like it HOT, this is just the ticket for you.<br />Also good in curries and cajun dishes. I know the Amazon listing says this<br />stuff is "unavailable", but this seller has this offered for $0.89, and that<br />is what we call a BARGOON! Sells locally here for around $3.<br /><br />Use it to stir fry shrimp, chicken, or beef, or just use it like you would any<br />condiment like salsa or Tabasco sauce. Amazing flavor, and trust me, this stuff<br />is hot. About a 7 on a scale of 10. Tremendous garlic and hot chili flavor, will<br />make you discover cooking all over again! This will perk up any Chinese takeout,<br />and its even good in Hot n' Sour Soup! Its very thick, almost like a paste so a<br />little bit goes a long way. 5 Pods<br /><br />BTW, this is actually the Huy Fong product you'll find elsewhere on Amazon. Its the<br />same stuff.

It makes great creamed potatoes! I love that you don't loose any nutrients from the steam process- you just blend the food in it's own steam juices!<br /><br />I have used mine every day for well over two months- as i said, for both the baby and my own food, and we have not had any problems with limescale or build up.

review/summary: Babycook is convenient and simple
review/text: We love this product. Granted, you can steam vegitables in a pot and puree them in a blender but the combined function in the maker along with the built in "no-guessing" measurment, makes it simple to use, convenient and easy clean up. We pour the puree into icecube trays and defrost two cubes per feeding, mixing flavors is so easy. We also prefer the cheaper individual storage containers with green lids vs. the beaba product. Bottom line, this product makes providing quality food easy.

review/summary: Poor Quality
review/text: I LOVED the Beaba the first two months I had it. I used it about twice a week for cooking food to store and twice daily for warming meals. After four months of use, the switch that engages at the top (safety feature) won't stay engaged, so I have to twist the top aggressively several times to get the machine to turn on - whether cooking or puree mode. So that's my first major disappointment.<br /><br />Second, the quality of the plastic doesn't seem to withstand the temperature of the steam, so the base of the main container has several cracks and leaks at the bottom. I am concerned about the plastic too - given how the steam is damaging it, I feel this may be one of those plastic that we are warned against heating foods in.<br /><br />For the price, I don't feel this product is worth it. Better to use a crock pot or food steamer and a Cuisinart.

I am so happy now that my baby girl looks and is healthier now, since I started using this product.

review/summary: Worth it for me
review/text: I've had this for a couple of weeks now, and I love it.  If you don't want to spend the $, there are certainly cheaper ways to get the same end result -- fresh, healthy baby food.  However, I'm a working mom of two who is willing to spend some extra $ for convenience and for the assurance that I am not going to forget that I'm steaming veggies on the stove and leave it on so long that it ruins the organic food I just spent a bunch of money on!  The ease of use, from prep to clean up, is a big plus for me.  Plus, I make small batches, with different combinations every time, so my daughter is getting a better variety of foods on a weekly basis than when I made food for my son (I made large batches of food with the pot/steamer/blender combo for efficiency, and there was only so much room to store it, and only so much time to steam all of the different types of food).  I'm also more likely to make my own food on a consistent basis because of the convenience; in the couple of weeks I've had the Beaba, I've only reached for a jar one time in a pinch.  It takes up very little space as well.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product to someone who is willing to pay a bit more for some added convenience and ease of use.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price tag, but I believe it's been worth it overall.  It seems like a quality product and seems well made.  If the price makes you cringe, just don't get it; you'll get by without it, for sure.  If not, and convenience is important to you, then I would recommend giving it a try.

review/summary: Wonderful Babyfood Maker
review/text: This is a great product.  So far, since receiving it, I have used this babyfood maker to make my fresh daughter sweet potato, butternut squash, yellow squash, cauliflower, strawberrie/banana, & poi.  the basket holds a good amount of vegetables/fruit (more than enough for one feeding), the steaming & pureeing process is very simple:add the spedicifed amount of water (a booklet & recipe booklet is included), the blade is very sharp and creates beautiful pureed food.  My daughter has loved everything I have made using this thus far.  Clean up is easy, storage is easy.  My only complaint is that the cover seems kinda loose. There is a latch thing that slides and is supposed to ensure a close and tight fit, but there I find myself holding the cover down just to ensure that the food/water doesn't come out the top.  otherwise, very good product - I enjoy using it and feel it is worth the cost.

review/summary: Bottom of blending bowl cracked and leaked after 3 months
review/text: I loved this product. The idea is perfect...healthy food for baby, minimal clean up, compact design. 1-2 times a week, I would use both the steaming and blending function to make 2-3 purees for the week. I also used the steaming function at least 2 times a day to heat up the frozen food. Everything seemed great, but after 3 months, the blending bowl started leaking. I changed the rubber gasket, but it still leaked. It turns out the bottom of the blending bowl had multiple cracks through it. I ended up buying a replacement bowl for $22. Hopefully it lasts longer this time. I also had similar problems that other people had with the brown stuff in the steaming reservoir. Overall, I probably would not have made this purchase. There are less expensive options out there. But after spending $150 on the thing, I had to replace the bowl, even if it was $22.

review/summary: Initially Awesome, then quickly mediocre
review/text: We recieved a Babycook as a baby shower present and were very excited to start using it.  As our daughter started on solids, the babycook worked great.  It's very simple to steam, blend and cleanup.  About a month into the transition to solids, you'll realized that the babycook is just too small to handle all of the fruits and veggies you want to cram into the little basket and it take a few rounds of use just to create enough food for 1 week.  While it's a bit more to clean it's much more efficient to steam using the stove and then a traditional blender.<br /><br />Additionally, our motor burned out after just 1 month (this appears to be a problem according to numerous posts).  I can't report on the customer service from Beaba but will follow-up with a resolution.  So far, I'm not impressed as there is no clear 800 # and you can only submit a claim via email.<br /><br />Knowing what I know now, I would not buy this again nor would I recommend it.  It does look cute on the countertop but just doesn't really replace the traditional tools to make baby food.

review/summary: Don't know how I could have lived without it before!
review/text: I have a 6 month old and 2 year old twins. I bought the baby food maker for the 6 month old and if I had known about it earlier, it would have saved me so much hassle, especially with making food for 2 babies! Before, I had to use lots of pots and pans and then I pureed using a hand held blender. This has made my life so much easier. It's so quick and easy and I hardly have any washing as I just give the parts a quick wash straight after use. I use it for making puree to add to plain yogurt for my 2 year olds who absolutely love it. I also use it for pureeing vegetables they usually take a dislike to but if I blend them into mash, I can sneakily make sure they are getting the veggies! I love that you get to use the water that the food has been steamed in so you are still able to keep those valuable vitamins that get lost in boiling. I think this machine is just fabulous and I would recommend it to every busy mom out there.

I spent $5 on vegetables and made food for 2 weeks!  I thought because I worked I would not have time, but I just make some on Sunday's.  Since I can make food for weeks, I don't do it that often.  I freeze in ice cube trays and once it is frozen, break it into ziploc bags and keep it in the freezer.  When I need food, I just thaw out a cube!

review/summary: Bought in 2008 and still going strong!
review/text: I bought the Beaba Babycook back in 2008 when it came to the US and was only available at Williams and Sonoma. We still use it practically every day for our little one and for us too. We started her out as a baby with steamed and pureed foods and now we just steam everything that can be steamed. I am happy to say that, perhaps thanks to the Beaba?, our toddler loves, loves, loves to eat steamed broccoli. She is the talk of the day care where she gobbles down her steamed broccoli like there is no tomorrow. I steam it and put it into an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PH5L4S">Aladdin 24-Ounce Micro Lunch Bowl, Grey</a>, a<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CSRDT0">Vivo Kids Bento Box, Orange and Pink</a> or a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O3GCFU">Foogo by Thermos Leak-Proof SS 10 oz Food Jar in Pink</a>. Just make sure that you use the liquid and pour it over the veggies. Otherwise they may dry out after a while. I also like to reuse the liquid in noodles or rice for our toddler's lunches at daycare.<br />I'm surpised though that the price hasn't come down since 2008. But I heard that Sam's Club offers the product a bit cheaper...<br /><br />Also, I mixed delicious ice coffee with vanilla icecream the other day - right there in the Beaba. Just had to make sure to clean it out properly later so as not to inadvertently mix caffeine with steamed broccoli...<br /><br />It's true that the basket becomes a bit discolored but it's not really a big deal.

review/text: I was given this as a gift, and I'll admit that I was skeptical about how much baby food I would actually make, and whether I would have time to make it while taking care of my little one.  Then in a VERY short amount of time today I made 4 whole ice cube trays of different purees.  I'm hooked - looking up recipes for different things I can make.<br /><br />My little one started solids very early (started rice cereal for reflux at 5 weeks and never looked back).  So I will use it a lot longer than those who start at 6 months.  I am going to enjoy taking my time introducing different foods one by one for the next months - and never having to buy a jar if I don't want to!<br /><br />Quick<br />Easy<br />Simple cleanup<br />Nutritious (all of you using the big steamer basket are losing tons of nutrients)<br /><br />Love it!

review/summary: Great customer service
review/text: I read many reviews on the beaba and other products similar to it, also spoke with my cousin who has used the beaba for two years on both her girls. She also writes for a baby site where she does extensive research on baby products. She told me she has never had any issues with mold or other problems that people report. I wanted to make sure I was buying something that was going to be worth it especially for how pricey it is.<br /><br />I'm sure you are worried about the mold problem and cleaning it out. This part is not as troublesome as I envisioned. After a couple of uses I cleaned it according to the directions which say to pour 100ml of water and 100ml of white distilled vinegar which can be measured using the blending bowl. After pouring the vinegar and water into the compartment it says to leave for the night and empty then you run it through a normal cycle w/water. I found that this did a great job. I also made sure that every time I was finished I would take the lid off the heating compartment so it can air out I don't really ever put it back on unless I'm steaming or it has been off for plenty of time to completely cool off.<br /><br />Another part of cleaning it that I learned is essential is taking the blade out and removing the gasket to clean. The gasket is a little sort of suction cup rubber thing that prevents everything from leaking out of the bottom of the bowl. The first couple times i didn't do this partly because I thought I could clean it good enough just left inside the bowl. I was wrong food gets stuck in ridges of the blade that are hard to clean unless you remove it. I had messed with the blade a couple times trying to figure out how to remove it. Later I found out in doing this I had left the blade a little lose. It started making unusual grinding noises and then at one point almost wouldn't work at all. Finally I took the blade off and found out the plastic part of the blade had melted due to it not being on tight. I called their customer service and left a message that evening. They called me back promptly the next morning and agreed with me on why this had happened. They are mailing me a new blade for free and i dont have to pay shipping even though my husband got it working smoothly with the blade I already have and are sending an extra gasket which I requested and am paying $2.00 for. The beaba comes with two gaskets anyway because it is made of rubber and is a material that can brake down easier than the rest of it (their words) they told me to throw away the other one because it was covering the part that melted and put on the extra one.<br /><br />I do love the beaba and think it is a great product. The cons: lots of parts to clean, I only use the beaba a couple times a week since I freeze the food so not a big deal to me ( i recommend the oxo freezer trays.) Pros: you can buy all of the spare parts online. con: shipping can be pricey about $5.00 for even a $2.00 item. The biggest pro for me is I get to feed my son healthy fresh food. I can tailor the food to his needs. Also I can control the texture by using the water the food was steamed with. Great product, great customer service.

review/summary: Returned - Chemicals in reservoir
review/text: I used my Beaba for the first time this week to make my 6 month old's food. There were some annoyance issues with its functionality (no beeping or alert to let you know when steaming is finished, smaller capacity which meant that one large sweet potato needed to be split into two steaming batches, and the fact that you have to hold the dial continuously during the puree stage or it turns off).<br /><br />While I could probably live with those factors, I became concerned when I read reviews from other parents regarding mold and other materials in the reservoir. I got out a flashlight and decided to look at the reservoir. Although I had followed the instructions to run the machine through three steam cycles before you begin using it, the reservoir contained brown liquid spots in the bottom. I used a paper towel to try and get out the spots. The liquid was some sort of chemical lubricant.<br /><br />If you wish to use this product, please make sure that you check the reservoir with a flashlight before and after each use. It seems pointless to go through the effort of making organic food for your child when the food ends up contaminated with mold or chemicals due to the Beaba's design.

review/summary: bad design - Can't clean water reservoir
review/text: Loved the product at first. It was so easy and convenient. However, I noticed that it took forever to grind up things that are little tougher or has a skin like green beans or peas compared to my food processor.<br /><br />Then I read some reviews regarding brown water coming out of the steaming unit. And when I checked my Baby Cook to my surprise found brown stuff on the bottom of the water heating unit. Was able to clean off a little bit but it is not designed to be cleaned easily. Thought the expense was for convenience but if the water reservoir can not be easily kept clean...I have no use for the it. Especially since it doesn't even grind as well as my food processor.<br /><br />Called the company to have it returned today. Hope it won't be a hassle.

review/summary: WONDERFUL!
review/text: Got this for my daughter who was using an old fashioned blender to make her baby's food which was a messy ordeal. I gave her this newfangled thing and she LOVES it! It is small and tidy and easy to operate and has a powerful little motor which steams food quickly with just a little water and then promptly turns the steamed food into perfectly pureed baby food.<br />Easy to clean too.<br />Probably not the machine for you if you like to whip up and freeze large batches at a time.

review/summary: LOVE it, great for toddlers too
review/text: Received this as a gift from my mom.  I am basically a lazy (or is it busy and overwhelmed?) person and I love the convenience and easy cleanup.  The device, container and basket are BPA-free, as recently confirmed by independent testing by the Svan company who is taking over distribution of the Babycook in the USA.  The steamer basket holds about a 1/2 pound of peas at a time, which purees down to a full baby food freezer tray, with a couple of servings extra.  Just how much of one thing do you want to make at a time anyway?  I expect that the Babycook will pay for itself, given the high cost of those little jars of babyfood from the market  - over dollar ($1.29!!! in some stores) here, even more for the organic ones.  Although I don't have hard water I always use filtered water, so there has been no brown stuff anywhere, like another reviewer complained about.  Also, love the fact that I can use the Babycook to defrost and heat the frozen portions.  Microwaves slightly change the molecular structure of foods.  The best part?  My three year old loves to cook her own veggie combinations in it (with adult supervision, of course) and eat what she cooks.  Since she is a picky eater I am over-the-moon about this.  I am also excited to be able to prepare meat in it because my husband has religious dietary restrictions and you can't get suitable prepared baby food.  Again, love this product.

review/summary: Love it!!
review/text: I love my Beaba Babycook. My daughter is a year old now, and I still use it to make applesauce, purees for casseroles, and soups. It's really easy to use, and I'm a single mother so I love anything that is quick, practical, and easy. As far as another review that said the Beaba is too small to make enough food, I stuff mine pretty full, that way I can make quite a bit of food at once. I don't like tons of leftovers and I don't freeze, so the amount it makes is perfect for my daughter and me. Definitely worth every penny!

review/summary: Spend $150 and you still have to pay $2 every month for a new gasket? Ridiculous
review/text: I've been using my new Beaba Babycook less than once a day for three months. It started leaking terribly whereby my entire unit would be sitting in a puddle of water after each cooking session -- VERY dangerous given this is an electrical appliance, so I contacted Customer Service. They very correctly told m that if the pitcher leaks, it is because the gasket needs to be replaced. I did exactly as told and it did fix the problem. However, I was concerned that I have used the Beaba less than once a day in the course of two months and the gasket already needed replacing. I was only pureeing poached pears and zucchini after all, nothing hard. Anyway, I raised this concern with Beaba and they basically expect you to buy a new gasket every month to replace the broken one. That's $2+shipping every month ON TOP OF $150 for the basic unit?!?!? That seems a bit ridiculous to me. Very disappointed in the overall design of the Babycook if this is what I am to expect.<br />Out shopping for a different baby food cooker and NOT recommending this one nor buying it for any expectant parents ever again!<br /><br />UPDATE: I have also had problems with the lid not matching up to the pitcher, and the food being pureed always shoots out the back and sides. This happens EVERY time I use it and sometimes, when using more water, it is very dangerous: Today, I scalded my entire forearm because the boiling hot water sprayed out when I was pureeing my steamed veggie. This is a very dangerous (and messy) design flaw and I don't see why for $150, Beaba can't make something where the lid actually covers the cooking unit.

review/summary: A food steamer is more useful
review/text: I did not use this item since it actually arrived damaged and so it was returned. Then, I chose to purchase a FOOD STEAMER (Nesco brand since it's the only one that is BPA free at this time) instead of getting a replacement Beaba. I am glad I did this!<br /><br />The Beaba is small and makes enough food for your baby... however I found that my baby who is now one years old eats ALOT of steamed foods (veggies, eggs, rice, etc.) about FOUR TIMES A DAY and that if I had gone with the Beaba I know I would have had to keep steaming and washing, steaming and washing the thing for each meal almost. With a food steamer I throw in all my food in the morning, turn it on and I have a whole day's worth of steamed foods for the baby, me and my preschooler! Less washing, less work, more happiness. :)

review/summary: concern about food safety
review/text: I agree with several of the reviews I read.  I have been using my Babycook for only 2 months and was really enjoying making my son's baby food, until I noticed that the water coming from the reservoir was discolored.  I looked inside the reservoir and noticed the black film that several other reviews mention.  Now I am very concerned about the food safety and will not be steaming my son's food with this machine.  I have even been diligent about cleaning it with white vinegar as mentioned in the instruction manual, which obviously did not prevent this probleme.  It also produces a small amount of food, so I am constantly having to make food for my son.  I have not tried to contact the company yet, but will be doing so this week.  I do not recommend this product.

review/summary: Not a real timesaver, and expensive
review/text: I bought this thinking it would be easier to have a two-in-one machine to make my baby's food.  The problem is that you can only make about four servings of food at a time.  I'm a working mom, so I need to make two weeks worth of food at a time and freeze it.  That means at least six batches in the Beaba, which would take hours.  In addition, the plastic is pretty thin, so I'm afraid to put the parts in the dishwasher.  This means HAND washing!  Add the descaling requirements, and this thing takes more time to clean than to cook with.<br /><br />The steamer also doesn't have any kind of 'off' signal, so if you have 'mommy brain' and walk away from it while it is steaming, it won't remind you when it is finished so you might come back long after the food has gone cold and then you have to throw it out.  The food processor blade is really inefficient so it takes a long time to get a consistent texture.  If you are processing anything starchy, that means it gets pretty glutinous by the time all the big chunks are out of the batch.<br /><br />For the price, you can get a full size steamer (that chimes when finished), and basic food processor or hand blender that will blend the food faster and more evenly.  And you can use those products for the whole family, not just the limited time the baby needs pureed food.  The Black & Decker steamer is very affordable and doesn't present the water scale problems that this machine has.

review/summary: not safe in my opinion
review/text: I wanted to like this machine but I changed my mind and I thought I would share.  First of all it is small and it is really baby food only machine. You have to cut up the food then turn on the steamer then take out the basket when its done and dump the food into the main container and blend.  You can accomplish the same exact thing in a regular stainless steamer on your stove in the same amount of time.  I tested it and I saved no time it was exactly the same!  The stainless steamer on your stove can also be used as a pot or to steam lager amounts and you will use it forever plus you can use the same steamer on the stove to defrost your baby food.  I freeze my baby food in tiny glass containers and I just stick them directly uncovered into my steamer on the stove.  If you use the silicone containers you just put your baby food in any glass bowl.  I do not use plastic for cooking.  I don't care it is BPA free there are other chemicals in plastic that can leach into the food therefore my stainless steel on the stove method is also safer than Beaba.  Also the Beaba water tank is coated with something.  It smells funny and makes the food smell and I don't trust that either.  It is not stainless.  Others have mentioned this as well so I do not feel safe about steaming in plastic and having the water come from some tank that smells funny.  For blending I just throw the food into a BPA free blender...yes that is plastic but you are not cooking in it and the exposure time is less.  You could use a glass bender or a stainless stick blender even better.  I actually do that as well its just that my BPA free plastic bender is tiny so its almost like the Beaba food maker.  So basically I came to the conclusion I can accomplish the same thing in the same amount of time with my standard kitchen cookware and appliances. I tested it and it took me the same exact time!  Plus my stainless steamer doubles and bottle sanitizer and bottle warmer.  I also have an asparagus cooker which is also great for warming up bottles and sterilizing but I use glass bottles so with plastic bottles you need to add more water so they do not melt sitting agains the metal...same goes for nipples I just boil them instead of cooking them in some plastic that is emitting chemicals into them like ALL THE STERILIZERS AND BOTTLE WARMERS DO!

However, the blend feature isn't as good as a regular mini-food processor. The blender never got out all the little chunks, even after blending 2-3 times.

review/text: The Beaba is excellent for baby's first foods- fruits and veggies. Makes steaming followed by blending fast, mess free, convenient and hygenic. I would highly recommend this product.<br />It took around 5-10 cycles of steaming water before I got rid of the chemcially odors from the steamer before feeling comfortable to start to use the product. You have to get creative and use your judgement in terms of how much water you'll need for different foods.<br />In all, a great purchase for anyone who wants to make their baby's first foods at home.

review/text: The Babycook works well as a steamer but the blender is basically useless. Unless your blending a full container the food gets stuck to the sides and your constantly stopping to scrape the food back to the blades. Very frustrating. Now, only after 1 month of use the blender actually quit working altogether.<br /><br />I am going to return it and buy the Baby Bullet. I have friends that own it and say it works great.

review/summary: Please, taste the water after it went through a  cooking cycle.
review/text: The idea of this product is great. It is well worth the price with all the time and money that it could save. After doing a lot of research, Babycook seems to be the best baby food making device on the market. However, when I checked the water after it went through the cooking cycle, I found that it had a strong mechanical smell and taste. After contacting the customer service, I followed their deep cleaning instructions. After leaving vinegar inside the water reservoir for a couple of days and running about a dozen cooking cycles, water seemed to come out cleaner. However, remembering how awful and strong it smelled and tasted at first, I am too skeptical to keep using this. All of us who make our own baby food do so to control what goes in our baby's tummy. I felt like I had no control of that while using Babycook. I actually bought the second Babycook hoping that it wouldn't be the same, but went through the same exact thing. Sadly, ended up returning them both. If Scandinavian Child looks into this issue and resolves it, I would definitely buy their product again as it is a breeze to use and is so space efficient.

review/summary: I love my Beaba!
review/text: We have a Beaba and I used it for all my 3 year old granddaughter's food when she was younger.  Now I am using the same one for my 5 month old grandson. I just noticed some complaints about the hollow handle getting caked with grime. I wash it immediately after use and run the faucet water through the handle. My handle is spotless inside. It has never had any grime in it. I love it and it has gotten a lot of use and still works wonderfully. I have used just about every fruit and vegetable in it without any problem. Both children have never had jarred baby-food and let's face it, there is no comparison between jarred food and home made, especially when it comes to taste.

review/summary: Design flaw in cleaning.
review/text: We used the babycook for preparing food for our son and the initial results were fine. However, after a few weeks of usage we noticed that there was a build-up of grime and dried food inside the handle. This occurs when the preparation bowl is very full during cooking and some of the steam and food enter the hollow handle. This is unavoidable and it is impossible to clean this out again. Why on earth they chose to place the opening of a hollow handle right next to the lip of the preparation bowl is beyond me. Who really wants to prepare baby food in a gadget containing old, dried and congealed food that cannot be cleaned? A design disaster that Beaba need to sort out.<br />All in all you are better off using a traditional steamer and a traditional blender.

review/summary: Great for busy moms!
review/text: I made my own baby food for my first child, I would spend a whole day every few weeks cooking and pureeing foods in large batches to freeze but with my second I just didn't have the time, so I decided to get a Beaba to make it easier, and boy did it do that! It does take a little prep work and I have to remember to do it before I start our dinner so it's cooled before we all sit down  but it is so much easier than when I did large batches, my blender never got it fine enough, it was kinda chunky and took a lot of work to use separate pots to boil and steam and then the blender, there were a lot more things to wash. The Beaba is so easy to use and clean, I highly recommend it for other busy mothers, I wish I had it for my first child! And I am finding ways to use it for my preschooler too, I add some of the pureed or steamed veggies to her food since it is hard to get vegetables in her, so I will be using this for a long time, well worth the money!

review/text: Like others have said, the reservoir is impossible to clean.  It has many crevices and is very dark with a small opening for a brush.  Mineral deposits even with a thorough vinegar wash/steam.  The metal inside also looks like it is coated in toxic chemicals like Teflon.  I didn't think about the plastic leaching until after I bought it, but of course plastic heated leaches.  It does not matter if it is bpa free, it's still plastic and it still has chemicals.  The cleaning required for this machine is exhaustive!  I wanted this cause a blog writer said how much it saved her time, but I can't see how that is true.  I am so regretful that I wasted my money on this.

I gave it 4 stars at this time because I found 2 things in the instructions that could have been a little bit clearer.<br /><br />1)  A little confusion in reference to the same part of the machine as a "steam heating compartment" as well as a "reservoir."<br />2)  Placing the gasket on the blender cutter as it's a little tricky pushing down the gasket where it needs to be, while being careful not to slip and cut yourself on the blades.

It is common for this to happen because someone has to translate it to other languages. but if you use your common sense and your life experience into it, you can figure it out. Study the machine and think how it is made and work, and you won't have a problem. I think the size is just right for making baby some foods.

review/summary: flimsy construction
review/text: I liked this product at first, but after the 5th or so use, the cheap quality really shone through.  When I first used it, the lid was very tight, but that quickly changed.  Now it fits extremely loose and there's a gap between the bowl and lid so that when used, it sprays food everywhere.  I tried pressing the lid down, but that only partially stops it.  I've only hand-washed it, so not sure why it warped so quickly.  Seems like the plastic is really thin and cheap.  Overall, seemed like a great idea, but if I had it to do again, wouldn't spend more than $40 for the thing.

review/text: Overall we are liking this product. The manual is horrible so there's definitely some trial and error and thinking you need to do to figure it out. Also, when pureeing the knob can be difficult to hold (not looking for it to lock, just to be easier to hold to the right).

review/text: With my second child, I made baby food the old fashion way.  Many pots, steaming, then I used a Magic Bullet to puree.  It was a pain.  This all in one system, is wonderful.  I love it.  I even make homemade applesauce for my older kids (ages 4 and 5) all the time.  It's easy to use, easy to clean and works really well.  I definitely recommend it.

review/summary: Makes making baby food super easy!
review/text: I love this! I'm a kitchen gadget person and what better than a kitchen gadget for baby? On a serious note, I have been using this for about a month now. I love the all in one thing going on. It makes about 8-12oz with a full basket of fruits or veggies easy to make batches to freeze for later! I have not tried the pasta/rice cooker yet, but will soon. I love how easy it makes making babyfood and is easy to clean up.

review/summary: Pretty handy appliance
review/text: Okay so don't try to decode the instructions for the initial setup (three rounds of steaming) without the assistance of someone who is not sleep deprived.  Let's just say the water might end up in the wrong place and it might leak out of the bottom of the steamer bowl.<br /><br />Other than that, works like a charm.  I love that I can steam and puree using one appliance even if it is totally superfluous.  This was a gift and I do wish I could make bigger batches for freezing.  This only made, for example, five one-ounce servings of peas but the product doesn't claim otherwise.  If doing the purchasing myself I would have stuck with food processor.  Oh and I still had to run the peas through a mesh strainer so they would be smooth enough for my 6 month old.<br /><br />All in all, four stars for the intended purpose of this item.  I've only had the pleasure of using the babycook a few times now so no comment on the mold issue but I will be watching for it.

review/summary: Ideal addition to the kitchen for baby
review/text: I loved the idea of fresh baby food and feeding my little one gourmet purees made by mommy. Unfortunately, with children in the home, its not always realistic that we have time to create amazing fresh meals. Enter the Beaba Babycook! This little device is BRILLIANT. Simply wash food (produce, fish, meat, whatever your heart desires!), put into the Beaba, and turn the knob. A few minutes later, everything is cooked evenly and with steam, locking in nutrients. Then turn the knob again and the entire contents are pureed and ready for the youngest eater.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented on the price, but I found that I SAVED money using the BabyCook-- no more jars of babyfood, no more wasted half-eaten portions. I would whip up a BabyCook full of food, freeze in ice cubes, and have tons of homemade baby food ready to go for weeks at a time. I also used this for an extra veggies found in the fridge-- easy way to stock up on produce purees.<br /><br />Its true-- this device essentially serves the same function as pots, steamers, and food processors. But I found that having one little device to do all the work made clean up more simple and made cooking 100% of my baby's food more realistic.<br /><br />Best of all, the BabyCook is BPA free and safe for baby. You won't regret this purchase.

review/text: This works wonderfully!  Put food in basket, steam, dump food in blender, blend.  So simple.  So easy to clean up afterward.  I can make many foods in one morning, so my baby gets variety.  It makes about 6 or so ounces at a time, filling one freezer tray.  I think this is good so that I don't have mounds of one vegetable in the freezer.  It makes it easy to keep variety in Baby's diet.  I have had the gasket leak BUT that was because I had it on upside down!  Flipped it over, no problem anymore!  I definitely recommend this cooker!

review/summary: Great idea but flawed
review/text: I just read a post about one person noticing a bad smell after using the steam function for a while and had to post because the same thing happened to mine! I got the babycook as a gift and loved it at first but after using it a couple times and after it sat unused for a couple of weeks I brought it back out and immediately noticed a strange smell while the steamer was on...almost a metalic smell. I then noticed the water had slight brownish tinge after it had collected. I tasted the carrots and they even tasted strange!! The design is flawed because it's basically impossible to clean inside the steaming compartment. After sitting around any extra moisture WILL collect bacteria. I also tried running vinigar through but it didn't really help. I'm not sure if you have ever looked inside of a water distiller but this is the same thing that collects inside - a nasty brown film from the excess stuff in tap water. I would definitely recommend using the purest water possible with this machine! Also, after using it a while I realized my own kitchen items I already have are just as good as this thing, if not better because I can cook more at a time and cut down on my overall kitchen time. This contraption is not worth the wopping 100+ dollars it is going for in my opinion.

review/summary: Get an Immersion Blender instead
review/text: Totally not worth it!<br />Babies eat the really fine purees for such a small amount of time and it is important to continually increase the texture.  I found that a $5 steamer basket and $15 Immersion Blender did a much better job and allowed me to make larger quantities of food with better texture results.<br /><br />In addition the area where you add water started to rust so I really question the craftsmanship here.

review/text: I got this product as a baby gift and I had to return it because the steamer leaked when used.  Got a second one and it did the same thing.  When I used it I had to put a towel under it because it leaked so much water.  Now 2 months later it is steaming out black stuff into the food.  This product is not worth the money, it is way over priced and made very cheap.  Another problem is that it is just way too small, you can only make small servings.  I am very displeased with this product.  Don't waste your money!

review/text: I didn't purchase this off of Amazon, but I felt the need to review it.  I registered for this and recieved it for my Baby Shower.  It is one of the best gifts that I received.  It's quick and so easy to use.  I make my son's food every three days.  An example of how much can be made at one time is about 8 1/2 oz's of carrots at at time, I dice the carrots, not too small, and add the water, and wait about 15 minutes, and it's steamed!  Then I simply blend it in it's own juices.  Its so great.  I don't freeze his food, he has fresh food every day. Like I said, I make enough for 3 days, etc etc...<br />Trust me, you will not regret getting this product.

review/summary: works great for only a few months
review/text: The Babycook was instantly one of my new favorite kitchen items when I first began pureeing for my daughter.  It works like it's supposed to.  You can "fix it and forget it" until you have time to go back and puree.  I've been making basic vegatable and meat purees for about 4 months now, and here is where the problems begin.  The pitcher (the clear thing in which you steam and puree the vegetables, etc.) is made of plastic.<br />There is also this disc like lid that you place inside the pitcher when you are pureeing.  Since the pitcher is NOT made of glass, like I would think it should be since the cost is so high (you can get cheaper baby food makers, I believe from Safety First and the magic bullet), the plastic bows and bends, so you can't always get a clean fit of the disc, and about 80% of the time, I can not get the pitcher to go on the stand the right way so that the machine will allow me to puree.  It is so annoying.<br />Also, there is this gasket piece which has already fallen off.  It has a replacement piece, but it's difficult to get it back in correctly so that the water used to steam does not leak out from the bottom of the pitcher.<br />I'd never pay the money for this again... so glad it was a gift!

review/summary: Never panned out; terrible construction
review/text: I wanted this product as soon as I saw it in a Williams Sonoma catalog, two years before I had my baby. It was my Christmas present this year and I was ecstatic about making homemade food for my then 6 month old with it.<br /><br />Well, I have a Ph.D. and I still can't get it to work properly. Once you clean it once, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get the seal back such that water does not leak out, making it impossible to steam or puree. I have another food processor (Cuisinart) that works fantastically well and I have used for four years without a problem. This is a problem with Beaba construction. I am pursuing a warranty refund. There is nothing on the website nor manual to help you anticipate this. The manual is written in multiple languages but only the inane, obvious instructions are written out. The only assembly instructions are a fuzzy drawing with arrows that say "Clic!"<br /><br />I am thoroughly frustrated and disappointed. Save the money and steam the food a simpler way and use a regular food processor. No need for this terrible French waste of money.

review/summary: Good design, bad implementation and service
review/text: As other french devices - it is very nice visually.<br /><br />But when you start to use it - it simply doesn't work properly.<br />It either doesn't boil the water or spits it in few seconds.<br />Apparently the thermostat design doesn't take into account things like atmosphere pressure or ambient temperature.<br /><br />Beaba France' service, being contacted for further explanations, has recommended to put water in the boiling tank. Huh?<br />Then they have recommended to RTFM. Huh?<br />Then they have told us to send it for repair.<br />Sent.<br /><br />Returned.<br />Put water. Turn on. It boils for 2 minutes, stops for 10 until getting a bit colder, then again boils for 2 minutes.<br />So the manual' 15 min cooking becomes 45-50minutes.<br /><br />Quality of the product was poor, the service was poor.<br />The device is going to trash can.<br /><br />To be replaced by a normal steam cooker like Avent.

review/summary: Easy To Use and Makes Homemade Baby Food A Snap
review/text: I was a bit overwhelmed at the idea of making my own baby food but wanted to give it a shot. The Beaba makes prep incredibly easy - you add water to one side and the food to the other, press one button to steam and then another to blend the food once it's cooked. I tried using a food processor at first but it was kind of a pain, so definitely recommend this. My one suggestion is to always reserve the leftover water that collects in the bottom of the steam basket - you'll sometimes need to add some of it to certain foods to help get them smooth when blended. Plus I've heard some of the nutrients from food end up in that water so it doesn't hurt to add it in.

review/summary: Mold, Mold, Mold
review/text: The other reviews that discuss brown water and mold? They're all true! The steamer is the perfect home for mold -- dark, moist, and warm. You can't clean it very well, as the steamer can't be submerged in water and the opening for the water is too small to effectively put any brushes in to aid in cleaning. I used vinegar for cleaning, but it doesn't clean entirely. You can still see brown deposits where the water goes. Yum -- just what I want to feed my kid!<br /><br />But even before the brown water appeared, I found myself using a regular stovetop pot and a food processor to do my baby food. The Beaba Babycook is not designed for making food in bulk. It makes maybe three or four meals for my hungry baby, and I prefer to make a great deal more baby food in one sitting.

review/summary: Food Particle Gets Stuck in Handle
review/text: At first I was so excited about the Beaba! I even called all my friends and raved about it. Now after 10 months of use, I don't like to use it anymore. Why? Well because food particles end up stuck in the handle. The handle is made hallow so that the water can travel to the container and "steam" the food. This is a great idea, however, the Beaba designers forgot one very important aspect: You can't remove the handle and take it apart to clean! Food particles get stuck in the handle and there is NO WAY to clean. I am a clean freak and I have tried everything to clean the handle. I even used toothpick to get into the small opening of the handle, but nothing worked.<br /><br />I now use a mini food processor and even if I have to steam veggies or fruit separately, the mini food processor is much stronger, can puree faster and make the food smoother.<br /><br />So yes, I loved it at first, but now I have fallen out of Love. I used my Beaba daily, so maybe if you won't use yours much, then, it might be a good choice, but if you plan to use it daily and plan to use it for a while, you will see what I mean about the little pieces of food stuck in the handle.

You certainly don't need the beaba, but if you can afford it, it is worth it.  I continue to make baby food because it is easy and very convenient.

review/text: I really like the Beaba Babycook.  It definitely makes it easy to steam and puree baby food.  I love that it's compact and easy to use and that everything cleans up easy.  Sometimes I have a little trouble getting the bowl to twist in properly...just have to wiggle it a bit to get the latch lined up.  The cup size is a bit small too, but it just means having to do a couple of batches.  I don't think I'd want anything bigger since it would be harder to store.  The spatula seems awkward but works surprisingly well to get the food out.  I recommend this with silicone freezer trays.  Makes it easy to freeze the food and then transfer the cubes to freezer storage bags.  I love having so many options for my baby at meal time.

review/summary: A five star product!
review/text: Our Beaba came in the mail over a week ago and we have honestly used it twice a day since we got it. We are an anti-microwave type of family so it's very helpful to quickly heat up baby food that we have frozen. It is fun to use and I think that will help us continue to make her food. It isn't a chore. Andy made her peas this morning before I woke up and I was a tad bit jealous. I read a review on Amazon where they were having issues with mold growing where you pour the water in. I have been careful to pour out any remaining water after we are done cooking and also only to cap it when it is in use. So far, so good. I think we would easily lose motivation to make our baby food if we didn't have this device that makes it quick, easy and fun. I hate cooking and loathe cleaning up after cooking, so I am very happy to have the Beaba! A five star product in my opinion.

I cook when I can.  I bake when I get the chance but... mostly, I dont have the time or confidence to pull it off anything 'new'... AND clean up multiple utensils!<br /><br />So many blogs out there chastise the Beaba buyers for wasting money--telling us to buy cheap steamer inserts and dust off our blenders, food processors and food mills...  For my first baby, I listened to these moms (and the Beaba wasnt in the USA yet).  I bought the food mill; I pulled out the steamer insert... and.. I froze.  My baby ate NOTHING BUT JARRED (organic) FOOD!  till she could chew the foods in my comfort zone. Baby food, all the prep and the coordination of all these tools was all so daunting. I was terrified I'd get it wrong... or couldnt keep sterile enough... or would get lost in all the piles of things I'd have to clean after each prep!!<br /><br />THEN THE BEABA!  Little to clean, nothing to get wrong, no digging through drawers and juggling appliances in my limited space!  I LOVE IT! Call me a slacker mom!  But dont call me frivolous with money!!  Organic Baby food is $1.10 a jar and my baby would go through 4-6 a day.  I've had my Beaba for 6 weeks, and it's already paid for itself.<br /><br />BTW, you can adjust the consistency to your baby's taste as he grows.  I figure soon I'll just be using it to steam, not blend.  And... I doubt it will be a permanent fixture in my kitchen! But ... its paid for itself!  Carrots smell like carrots!!! and ... its given me a confidence that I hope extends to other culinary projects!  Slacker moms, buy it.<br /><br />PS Careful if you're reading those blogs re: Beaba and BPA.  Read ALL the blogs.  The most uptodate will lead you to the latest info promising this product IS BPA free.  There are blogs that appear current but have not updated this info.

review/summary: Useful especially if you have a small kitchen, one safety concern though
review/text: I live in a small apartment and don't have room for lots of gadgets (not even a microwave). I find this appliance to be worth the counter space.  I like that you can steam and puree in one appliance, and that I don't have to lug out the steamer and blender to whip up some food.<br /><br />Some reviewers say your baby will outgrow this machine's usefulness in a few months but I disagree. My baby eats mostly finger foods but still I use the Beaba a lot. I use it to reheat leftovers (again, we have no microwave) and also use it to chop or puree adult dinners that are two hard for baby to eat.<br /><br />It's not a huge capacity but that doesn't bother me. After spending whole weekends steaming, blending and freezing veggies, just to discover that my kid's taste buds changed and what he once loved he now refuses, I'm over large scale baby food production.<br /><br />One safety note!  There is a little hole that the lid clicks into. That hole leads to the water chamber and I once accidentally tipped the machine over and scalding hot water came out of the hole and landed on my hand.  I got a nasty burn.  Definitely keep this machine well away from the edge of counters!

review/summary: Had a bad problem - now it's solved and the Babycook works fine.
review/text: This is the first product review I have been compelled to put on Amazon.  Bought this because most prepared baby food is disgusting and I wanted an easy way to serve fresh food to our son.  This product was highly reviewed and I like gadgets so it seemed like a good fit.  It worked well in the sense that it was convenient and cooked baby food, but after about 3 weeks, I noticed that the water used for steaming was brown and sweet smelling.  I looked in the reservoir and noticed brown grime on all of the metal and a sickly sweet smell.  I assumed (unfairly) that my mother-in-law had mistakenly put food into the reservoir hole and then was embarrassed to say anything, so I cleaned the unit with vinegar as per the instructions and tried again.  We've only had the unit since Feb 2010, use it only 2-3 times a week and now had the same problem 3-4 different times.  The water used to cook the food is brown and disgusting and I have cleaned (physically scraped) brown grim the reservoir multiple times.  I have contacted Beaba and they have suggested that it's a descaling issue and to descale the unit once a month.  I completely disagree as we have had the same coffee maker for three years and never descaled it once.  I don't know if food is being spun into the reservoir or what, but at this point, we have a $150 baby food maker that we are afraid to use.  What's the point of fresh baby food if it's covered in some kind of unknown detritus?  Beaba has so far been unresponsive about a replacement/ repair.  Will update with any new developments.<br /><br />Update 2/25/11- this is an update to the review above.  I'm not sure, but now think the problem of the brown water had to do with not properly using the plastic cover when blending the food (aka user error) allowing particles of food to enter the water chamber and be subsequently reintroduced into the baby's food.  I say this because while no one in my family would admit to not using the plastic screen when blending, as soon as I reiterated that everyone should be using it, the problem stopped and we have used the Baby food maker without incident since.  So not sure what caused the problem, but it seems to have gone away recently and we are now happy with the product again.  I revised my rating to 4 stars.

review/summary: Great except for one huge design flaw
review/text: I got the Beaba Babycook as a gift, and adored it for several weeks. I work and have very little spare time to spend in the kitchen, so I loved being able to steam and puree my baby's food without having to clean multiple pots and pans. Then, after about a month of regular use, I noticed a foul odor coming from the well where the water goes. I looked inside and saw that a brown crust had formed there. I figured it must be lime deposit that had turned brown from being exposed to the hot temperature of the babycook, but when I tried to descale the well, the vinegar did almost nothing to remove the brown deposit, even after several attempts. I was also very worried to see that the water that ended up in the steamer basket was brown, thus suggesting that if I tried steaming more veggies, the deposit would end up in my baby's food.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer, and they recommended using distilled water (although there was no mention of this in the manual). So, I exchanged my now completely dysfunctional Babycook for a new one, and tried again. Within two days the brown film had developed, even though I was using distilled water. I don't know much about appliance design, but I figure there must be something really wrong with this gadget if it takes only a few days for such a deposit to form. And the odor is truly foul - no way I want my baby's food within a foot of whatever it is that collects there.<br /><br />I don't see any mention of this problem in other reviews, but at the same time, I can't imagine that I am the only person this has happened to, given that it happened TWICE to me. Too bad - I really loved the idea behind this product!

review/summary: Beaba Babycook makes family meal time easier
review/text: After reading some of the reviews, I almost got scared off this, and am glad I didn't.<br /><br />I did batch cooking for my first two kids, who are now 3 and 4. When it came time to move my 6 month old into solids, I wanted to home make his food also. But since I have less time and freezer space, batch cooking just wasn't feasible. I wanted to make his foods from the ingredients I was using for the family meals. Trying to puree small amounts in a regular size blender or processor is impossible. I saw this and though it would make meal time easier - and it does!<br /><br />Now the baby eats what we are eating, just steamed and pureed. I can make 3-4 servings at a time and just put the extras in singe serve containers in the fridge. I cooked a whole chicken, pulled off the meat and out it into small snack sized bags and put them in the freezer. Now while I am cooking for the older kids, I put one serving of chicken, with some veggies and/or fruit in the cooker and it cooks away while I am making dinner for the rest if the family. E.A.S.Y.<br /><br />-The mold issue other reviewers shouldn't be a problem, if you make sure the reservoir is empty and  leave the top off so that it can air dry. Same for the blender/steamer parts. Just dry them between uses. I use water from my Brita to reduce build up between descaling. If your reservoir in a regular steamer isn't emptied all the way, it will do the same thing.<br /><br />-The counter top footprint is small, about � of the size of my Kitchen Aid stand mixer. It's small and does small amounts, it doesn't say that it does large batches. So I'm confused as to how people are disappointed that it doesn't do large batches. It states it has a 2 � cup bowl.<br /><br />-The Beaba website sells the replacement parts all separately which I liked, just in case something needs replacing.  I cook a lot and have has to replace blades on my large processor, so I'm glad that the parts are so easy to get.<br /><br />-The steamer does shut off automatically and the light goes off, but just like a regular steamer, if you leave food over boiling water, it will continue to soften. The booklet gives you the times for the steamer, so timing it is actually pretty easy. (Level 1 on the bowl is 7 minutes, level 2 is 10 minutes, level 3 is 15 minutes).<br /><br />-The Beaba website has more free recipes. (My kiddos fav is 2/3 pumpkin, 1/3 pear and a dash of pumpkin pie spice)<br /><br />-The blender part worked great for my 6 month old, totally pureed the pumpkin, carrot, sweet potato, pear, nectarine, banana and butternut squash that I pureed in there. I thinned with water or pear juice.<br /><br />-You hold the switch to the right to puree the food. For me, it's not a big deal to hold a switch for 30-60 seconds. So I don't see this as a design flaw.<br /><br />-The top and bottom don't line up perfectly - they can't or else too much pressure would build up in the steamer and it would pressure cook the food, not steam it.<br /><br />In short, This is my 3rd baby that I've cooked for at home, and I love this. Some of the design flaws others talked about aren't really flaws at all. I have to cook a meal for the kids at 5 and one for my hubby and I at 7 when he gets home. This makes it easy to make the baby's food at the same time with the same ingredients.

review/summary: Much better options out there
review/text: This has been around in Europe for ages - many of my friends have it in London and I can see the apeal of this little steamer/grinder combo gadget however the price in the US is unbelievable!! It makes no sense to buy this when a regular "adult" steamer (such as the Black & Decker I reviewed) with a basket 4x the size is $30! I make my own baby food and love having a large basket to cook 4 sweet potatoes at once or a whole bag of baby carrots and freezing the extra portions in ice cube trays. With the Babycook, one would have to steam & puree almost every day -- who has the time? Secondly, with many baby foods, you have to remove the skins after steaming anyway, so it completely defeats the purpose of steaming & pureeing in the same basket. Lastly, when doing some reasearch into this product, I found that it may leech BPA chemicals so please look into this if it is important to you.<br /><br />All in all, I think the Babycook looks adorable and has a cute little name and packaging but if you are a busy, tired mom, do yourself a big favor and get a regular, adult-sized steamer (like the B&D) that can make a month of purreed baby food at a time to freeze and re-heat when needed. The baby will outgrow this machine in a few months and then you are stuck with a $150 useless appliance. With a regular steamer, you can make dinner for your family simply and easily for years

review/summary: Serious Danger to Baby's Health-PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING
review/text: I cannot urge parents enough to NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT for your child or, for that matter, ANY other child. I normally hate it when people use caps to voice a strong opinion, but for this review, I make an exception. I feel it is my duty as a fellow parent to inform others so they can protect their children from the effects of this product.<br />What some of the other reviewers have written is true: this machine grows mold. The only reason why other reviewers haven't written the same is because they either cannot see the mold, are mistaking the mold for water deposits (or the type of water they used) or are mistaking the mold for food build up (or food accidentally getting into the water reservoir).<br />I ran the vinegar cleaning through it so many times, I was sure it boiled out any kind of buildup that could possibly be in there, but I was wrong. I do not believe you can ever fully rid the reservoir of every last trace of mold and no matter what you use to clean it (though I would doubt anyone would use anything more harsh than vinegar or anything edible because of the purpose of the water reservoir), it will come back.<br />I am worried that parents have trusted that this "cleaning" gets this clean and sterile for continued use.<br />I also noticed decay of some kind on the side vent, which is impossible to even TRY to clean.<br />This machine is not safe for food preparation of any kind for anyone, MUCH LESS a baby.<br /><br />If you are looking at this babycook, you are wanting to give your baby a healthier start in life. You will do that if you do not cook their food with the Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker.<br /><br />If you are reading this, ask yourself: if even just a FEW of the comsumers of this product found mold growing inside of it, WHY RISK BEING ANOTHER? Keep your baby safe from this machine. DO NOT BUY.

review/text: I have been using this product for about 2 months and was soooo happy with it! I came on here to see if any other reviewers had written recipes, (I think my baby is getting bored with the ones we have been using). Then I saw a couple reviews about mold build up in the water resevoir. So I go over to look in mine with a flashlight and about had a heart attack! There was mold AND the brownish buildup. I cant belive my daughter hasnt gotten sick from the food I have been making her! Of course we are now past the 30 day warrenty and Im stuck with this nasty nasty machine. Please do not buy this product. I use vinegar to de-scale once a week and its still all moldy in there!!

review/summary: MOLD forms due to DESIGN FLAW, and company will not return!
review/text: Please DO NOT buy this product or anything from HEALTHCHECK SYSTEMS! I don't know how they can call themselves by that name. I happened to read another reviewer who found mold in the water reservoir, got an exchange, and had the same thing happen. I used this as intended with the splatter shield, and ran it through multiple de-scalings by using vinegar/water, and the mold did not go away- except some gets into the food basket each time you steam! So, your baby is eating his/her food with mold in it. The company says they don't have this problem- probably because they are ignorant and don't care about me sending it back to test it, and people don't know because it is hard to see into the reservoir. I have only used this for about 4 months and am very clean. The manager hung up on me! They refused to listen to what I had to say, and stand by their 30-day return policy! Mold does not grow in 30 days! They must know their product is garbage with that kind of return policy. I can't believe they are allowed to sell products under that name that can cause babies and children to get sick! It's no wonder my baby had a temporary "unknown" allergy! They do not have any concern! They should not be able to sell on Amazon!

review/summary: An efficient appliance that doesn't take up too much counter space
review/text: Through recommendations from friends and an informal cost-benefit analysis (j/k) I bought this item. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the price. Nice concept in a convenient package that is aesthetically pleasing and holds the Williams-Sonoma name...but I still think the price is jacked-up.<br /><br />I am a first time mom, and I was excited to start whipping up some organic fruits and veggies for my daughter. I resisted buying the Babycook at first thinking a stove-top steamer and my Magic Bullet would suffice. I am embarrassed to say how long it took me, so let's just say after making a batch of carrots, peas, and corn, the excitement was over. It was so tedious! And so many dishes to wash. The next day I bought the Babycook and made twice the amount of food in half the time, with very little cleanup. I'm ok with the amount of food it produces since I don't like to make big batches due to freezer space. The blade is very strong and does a very good job on hard items like the skins of beans and peas. My Bullet would still leave little chunks that were potential choking hazards. I make a week's worth of baby food, and when the machine is not in use I let the water chamber and other parts air dry. I don't think it is very useful for reheating because it takes a long time and sometimes the food comes out too moist (but this might be user error).<br /><br />So far the product has been a pleasure to use and has made my life a whole lot easier.

review/summary: Love it! Convenient, easy to use, and excellent food for baby...
review/text: I received the Beaba Babycook from a friend who is a cookbook author.  At first I thought it was a little "redundant" as many people have noted that you can use a steamer, strainer, and blender.  But I have to say, this thing rocks!  All of the veggies and fruits that I've put in the Babycook turn out sweet and perfectly cooked (never overcooked).  My husband and I actually prefer the taste of the plain purees (I don't add salt or spices) over seasoned foods.  My baby LOVES everything I've made (organic: pears, apples, peas, sweet potatoes, squash, green beans, bananas, etc).  So easy to use and the results are amazing.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />One final note: My baby wouldn't eat the store bought peas, but she gobbles up the homemade version.  After doing a side-by-side comparison of several fruits and veggies (store vs homemade) the results were clear:  homemade is so much more flavorful and the true flavors really shine. I won't go back to commercial baby food, as this machine is easy to use and well worth the effort.

review/summary: Grows with baby
review/text: I've been using the Beaba babycook for about 3 1/2 months now, and this is still my favorite baby item, despite its few drawbacks.  YOu can steam in a steamer basket and then just dump your vegetables (or whatever you're steaming), right into the food processor part.  It's small enough to keep on the counter, and it does a much better job of pureeing than a blender - especially when baby is little and you want to ensure no chunks.  My boys are a little bigger now (9 1/2 months), so I've run into problems with capacity (I have twins) - but I just bought a steamer basket and steam veggies on the stove and use the Beaba if I need to puree the food.  I'm not pureeing as much anymore, but I found it is VERY helpful for "soups".  My boys are at the in between stage where they can handle a few lumps, but nothing major, and I didn't have the time to chop up the super tiny pieces that would have satisfied me.  So instead of pulling out my big food processor, I just use the Beaba to dice the vegetables into small, baby friendly size.  I don't recommend it for raw potatoes - it turns mushy quickly (and definitely don't try to make mashed potatoes in here!)  Main drawback is size.  But after a few stints of all-day cooking and freezing, I found that aside from keeping a small stash of freezer food for their dad to use, it's just as easy to prepare food every few days and keep it in the fridge.  Also, as babies get bigger, you can start cooking rice and pasta, adding it to the vegetables.

review/summary: Great and handy
review/text: Before my purchase (from a local store, not Amazon), I had my doubts about this expensive product, but as someone who was just starting to make baby food for an 8.5 month-old who was not too keen on the chunkier textures, and since I didn't want to feed him the stage 3 store jars with meat in them, I needed to know that I was doing it right (steamed enough, etc), and this practical item did the trick. Sure it doesn't make very big batches (maybe four to six 4 ounce-containers at one time), but realistically: if you have a younger infant, you feed 1-2 ounces portions, and so that's quite a few meals (8-10). Each run is 20-30 min at the most (including the grinding), and you can do other things while the food steams. With an older infant, like mine, this is the age when you want to challenge their palate a little and introduce some variety in their diet, so it is fine for that. The verdict: 2-3 hours every Sunday (if you do it once a week) for a 9-month old who will eat out of your plate in 3 months, and I am sure half that for a younger baby who is just getting weaned. And in case you wonder, I work full time. Overall, it is nice to have one device that does the steaming and the processing (it can also reheat, but it is just as easy and safe in the microwave if you are careful). And I love the spoon that is angled just right to get every little bit of food out of there.

Before my Beaba Babycook arrived I had tried to make baby food using a blender and a food processor and could not get the nice smooth purees that I was looking for and had a big mess and a sink full of dishes to clean.  This product does a beautiful job steaming and mixing baby food.  I love that I really only need to wash 3 pieces: the mixing bowl, the steamer basket, and the lid. For parents interested in fresh, homemade baby food rather than store purchased jarred food this is the tool for you.

Now if I could just find something to chop all the food for me, I would be doing great! :) Anyway, I would definitely recommend this product. I probably would not be making baby food if this product had not come along. It is simple and quick to use, something that is essential for me as a mother of twins!

review/text: I did the most basic way with my first child using steamer and blender.  For my second one, I try Beaba Babycook =p  And no regrets!!!  This is way more convenience and faster! not to mention, FRESHLY MADE!!! I just need to give 5 minutes work to prep and clean. and the rest 15 minutes is just waiting the food to be cooked.  So I now "cook" twice a day for breakfast and dinner with ease =)<br /><br />I can see the difference in taste too. The liquid that comes out from the food are used, when pureeing, so using Beaba Babycook enhances the food taste. Yes you can use the liquid that was coming out in the steamer too. However, it is hard to measure how much water I should put to steam the whole batch of food.  More often, I put a lot of water because I worried for burning the pan. So the liquid ended up not as concentrated as the one in the Beaba Babycook.<br /><br />*Thanks for reading my review, hopefully you can find it useful.  I apologize for any grammatical errors - ESL =p *

review/summary: Great and convenient product
review/text: This is a great and convenient product for making your own baby food. I like the design (it looks good on the counter) and it is very easy to operate and clean. The only minor issue I have with this product is that the lid on the steamer basket does not 100% seal the basket. There is a tiny little crack between the lid and the upper edge of the steamer cup, where a bit of steam escapes during the process. Maybe the lid is not supposed to seal 100% (pressure?), but it does not seem to affect the performance of the steaming. The blender is also very effective. I have used this daily for both veggies and fruits for about a month now, and it is holding up well.

review/summary: love this item
review/text: I purchased this item primarily to make my own babyfood combinations that were not available in the stores. I just made some stage 1 carrots and peas to get the hang of it. It was sooo easy! I made two trays of food for less than 2 dollars, and my daughter loves the food. I used frozen veggies. The time used was minimal. I believe it took me 20 for each vegetable! I can't wait to try the frozen mango and peaches. I think I will be making the majority of her babyfood now!<br />The only thing I wish was different would be that I could turn the mixer part on and be able to leave it for a few moments, instead of having to constantly hold it.

review/summary: Lazy Mom's Dream!
review/text: I wanted to make my own baby food, but I'm so lazy. I have a blender, and I know I could just use that, but then you have to clean the blender and the pots and pans you used to steam the food to begin with, etc. This one does it all, and you can throw the pieces in the top rack of your dishwasher. Easy peasy.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: Anyone who thinks preparing your own baby food is difficult or time-consuming should try this out.  It's so easy.  The baby cooker steams and purees perfectly.  It's easy to clean.  It's pretty effortless.  Just get a baby food cookbook and you can raise your little one to become an adventurous eater.  If you cook at home for yourself, there is no reason to not cook for your baby too- I only wish my meals were as easy to prepare as my babies'!

review/summary: WONDERFUL!!!!
review/text: This babyfood maker is absolutely amazing!  I'm addicted to making food now and have enough made to last awhile.  If I can wait that long to get it back out.  I've even started making purees for the rest of the family so that I can put my cookbook to use called deceptively delicious.  YOU HAVE TO GET ONE!!!

review/summary: Simple and Easy Baby Food
review/text: After having been turned off to canned baby food I was extremely excited to find this product.  I received it for Christmas as my baby turned 4 months old and it works wonderful.  It is so simple to understand and works too well to find an excuse to drop money on canned baby food.  One apple and pear diced and steamed made enough food for 4 days and when combined with a wonderful storage container there is no reason not to cook your own baby food.  I would recommend this product to everyone I meet that has just had a new baby.
