Although they are a bit pricey they are high quality and organic. I am now encouraged to try other products by this brand especially since Amazon is currently offering an extra discount on some of their products. Enjoy this healthy treat! I've already finished one bag.

review/summary: Because the 23-oz Boxes were a bit too much
review/text: I at first wanted to order the 23-oz packages, but when I received that box, there was way too much cereal.  Instead decided to go with the 17-oz, and, being a single person, I obviously eat loads of cereal, so this helped me out a lot.<br /><br />It's cheaper than Sam's, and it's the perfect amount of cereal for me so that I don't have to keep going back to the store.  And, since it has so many preservatives, it keeps FOREVER.  Book arrived in good condition, and the cereal isn't ground into powder, so it's 5 stars!

review/summary: A very appealing pate for the price
review/text: Once I got over the feeling that I was opening and serving myself a jar of cat food, I was quite pleased by the taste and texture of this pate.  It has a surprisingly subtle mix of flavors and strikes the right balance between the earthiness of the mushrooms, a smoky marsala wine, and the rich butteriness of a pate.  I really enjoy the pate with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYGY9M">Carr's Poppy And Sesame Crackers</a>.<br /><br />If you're going to serve this to guests, I'd recommend carefully spreading this on crackers or stirring it up in a serving dish ahead of time to avoid any can-shaped chunks from turning people off.

review/summary: Great for strong chewers
review/text: Our dog is a very strong chewer and we are always looking for something that is safe for her to chew, but will keep her interest for extended time. Tried the reindeer antlers and she enjoys them, but once they have been chewed on she loses interest. Not so with the moose chew.  She chews on it until she gets tired.  There have been no sharp edges or shards to injure her. I bought a 2-pack to try and the first one has lasted a few days now.<br />They are expensive compared to rawhide or pig ears, etc.  But it has held her interest longer than nylabones. Haven't seen any bad digestive reactions so far.

review/summary: That small?
review/text: I gave the two pieces of antler to a friend's two pitbulls and he said they had devoured them in about two hours. For the price, it was a waste of money. I guess if someone had a smaller dog it would be worth it, but the dogs in my arena are big dogs and bigger chewers and the antlers didn't last half a day. I won't spend money on antlers again. I will try to find someone who goes hunting and will give them to me for free. Nice idea though.

review/text: I was buying these at the pet store for $20 EACH, with this deal you get two for that price.  I ordered the largest size possible because I know my corgis like to chew the heck out of these.  They love these.  I've discovered they prefer the flat ones to the rounded type.  One that was sent in this deal was just a little curved, which makes it harder for their stumpy legs to hold while chewing, so they "argue" over who gets the un-bent one!  If I hold the crooked one then they will chew it but they definitely like the flatter one best!  A very good value if your dogs are chewers!!!

He gives it a lick once in a while, but doesn't want anything to do with it most of the time. The chihuahua loves it, but it's way too big for him so he just chews on the corners.

review/summary: Great Natural Treat
review/text: These moose antlers are a great natural treat for my small dogs. I bought the first antler piece because my trainer recommended  it as a preservative-free product. The pieces I purchased through Amazon are small but for little dogs like my 7 month old Chihuahuas they will last a long time. I prefer these over bully sticks or rawhides because they do not cause any tummy upset or difficulties with the pups' stool. For small dogs like mine, just a few minutes with a bully stick today means a rumbling tummy tomorrow. When I first introduced the antler piece, the female barked at it and ran away. The male immediately took to it so his sister had to give it a try. Now she loves them as much as he does. They will sit or down or just about anything to get their antler. Another plus is that I will let them bring the antler onto my lap! Not so with a slimy bully sticks.

review/text: I have a 12-year-old and 2-year-old dog that are VERY food/treat/chew motivated.  I was so glad to find these as it fit all of my requirements on natural/no antibiotics/USA, etc. etc.  Since neither have ever turned down a treat or chew, I was shocked when they walked away.  For two days I've tried to get them interested. Nothing.  Took them to a neighbor whose dog also walked away, and then to a friend whose dog did the same thing.  Wish I could give it zero stars, but review has to show at least one.

review/summary: This makes the absolute best chili!
review/text: We purchased the hot pepper paste just to try it.  After one taste, I knew that it would be great in our homemade chili.  Instead of cutting up 10 to 12 chili peppers and reducing them in olive oil, we just put in one tube of the hot pepper paste, along with our other liquid ingredients (plus the meat), and it made the absolute best tasting chili I have ever tasted!  We seldom make chili because it is so labor-intensive, but with this paste - we make it in no time, and now we can enjoy it more frequently.  A little dab goes a long way in making pasta sauce more zingy, and we have found about 40 other uses for this product.  I cannot recommend it more highly than by saying that you MUST try this awesome paste!

review/summary: Great Italian flavor that brings the heat.
review/text: This pepper paste is almost identical to GIA which also comes in a similar tube. I love the flavor, it's like spicy pepperoni without the meat. It's salty as well, and it's a great addition to a lot of sauces and italian dishes. I use it in pasta sauces, pizza sauces, and as a pizza topping. I put it in little dabs all over the pizza. Combine that with some prosciutto or pepperoni and it's amazing. I also put it on crackers and bread and mix with olive oil and other tapas/appetizer type stuff.<br /><br />I was a little worried when I ordered this that it would be more Asian style pepper paste because a couple of reviewers that characterized it as tangy and similar to Asian pepper pastes. I think that the only thing in common is they are both fairly hot and spicy. Asian pepper pastes and sauces tend to be very tangy and sweet and sour/acidic. This in contrast, is not very tangy or acidic, and definitely not sweet. It's spicy and salty.

Right now I'm enjoying the box he just gave me as an early birthday present.<br /><br />In this box, there are two trays of twenty chocolates which include (as described on the inside box cover) four of each type -<br />Hazelnut Caress, roasted hazlenut hugged by smooth caramel<br />Hazelnut Heaven, whole roasted hazlenut whirled in milk chocolate<br />Eastern Delight, exotic Turkish delight locked in milk chocolate<br />Caramel Heart, luscious soft caramel encased in a milk chocolate heart<br />Caramel Charm, luxurious chewy caramel<br />Strawberry Kiss, strawberry filling with vanilla flavour fondant cream<br />Orange Truffle, smooth chocolate truffle flavoured with tangy orange<br />Honey Love, honey-flavour caramel<br />Fudge Dream, vanilla flavour fudge drenched in milk chocolate<br />Nut Secret, hazlenut in milk truffle in milk chocolate<br /><br />My very favorites, of which I am unwilling to share, are the Strawberry Kiss, Honey Love, Caramel Heart, Orange Truffle, and the Turkish Delight, which has a soft center of a kind of gelatin consistency. Most delights are rose-flavored, but these don't taste rosy to me.<br /><br />These chocolates are so delicious. I'm not going to tell you to enjoy in moderation because what's the fun of having a whole box of chocolates if you aren't going to indulge? One piece will lead to another and another! You will also find that pieces will mysteriously disappear from the box (pointing the finger of blame at my husband) so I'd advise to hide your Milk Tray someplace safe. :)

I am embarrassed to serve it to anyone but my kids.<br /><br />I'm sure it would have been good if the packaging were better.  When I recieved the TWELVE boxes I ordered, every single one of them was completely melted.  This was not the candy makers fault, but Amazon's packaging.  I gave them packaging feedback, but they have not responded in any way.<br /><br />So, lesson learned:  Assuming Amazon will not improve their packaging of meltable food products, ONLY ORDER THIS IN THE WINTER !!

review/text: I love these candies and bought them to share with my office mates at Christmas. They loved them too; particularly the interesting combination of tastes and textures. This is such a great deal compared to buying individual packages at a local store, if you can even find them there, that is. The ads used to say "it's too good for kids." While I'm not sure about that, I do know the adults really enjoyed them.

review/text: I bought these chocolate to give out as small gifts for Christmas but I may have to keep them all myself!  So delicious, as only European chocolate can be!  They do make great gifts as they are not easy to find in the States and most people haven't heard of them; just be warned that it's hard to part with them once you've tried them.  I also ordered them in the fall to avoid having them melt in the delivery truck or on my porch

review/summary: Fabulous for chicken salad
review/text: I sampled the marinade at St. Jean winery in CA, bought a bottle ($1 more than at Amazon), and intended to make the chicken salad recipe on the label of the marinade.  Eventually I asked my friend Jean, an excellent cook, to make the chicken salad for me.  She doubled the recipe, and followed the directions on the bottle exactly.  We both thought the result was fabulous.  I'll buy it again even though it's on the expensive side.  The chicken salad was terrific. It is definitely worthy of serving to company. I love the distictive flavor of this sauce.

review/text: My dog loves these sticks.  She has several food allergies and reacts negatively to rawhide, pig ears, and other chew treats.  It's been tricky to find things that satisfy her chewing without making her skin flare up.  These do the trick!  They are a little stinky but if they are not individually wrapped, I just put them in a Ziploc bag for storage.

review/summary: Great price, but stinky!
review/text: One of my dogs has food allergies, so buffalo (actually bison) is a good alternative to cow products. I had tried Canine Caviar California Rolls at my local holistic pet store before I purchased them here and found them to be suitable for an average chewer as a good occasional chew (lasting anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes).<br /><br />The best aspect of these treats is the price on Amazon. At my local pet store, they sold for $3.99 each. Since the price here is almost 80% off retail at less than $1.00 each, they are an extremely good deal.<br /><br />The only problem, however, is that the batch that I ordered stinks to high heaven. Don't get me wrong, I was prepared for some stinkiness, given that I have purchased these before and am aware that this is a natural animal product. These came packaged each individually wrapped in plastic, then placed in larger plastic bags, then placed in a display box and they still smell like concentrated bison sweat through the packaging. Once you open it, you will need an iron stomach to not retch. Of course, the dogs think that they are a to-die-for delicacy and relish them all the more.<br /><br />I believe that the manufacturer probably needs to allow these to dry out a little more before packaging them. All of the individual wrapping may actually be sealing in moisture that is causing the excessive stink. If the manufacturer were to address the smell by drying them out more, adjust the packaging and include desiccant packs, I would definitely become a repeat customer.  However, I'm not sure that the amazing price is worth the stench of these. I will probably go with another product once we've gotten rid of these California rolls.

review/summary: Outstanding tea even if it is from a root and not a tea plant.
review/text: I bought this product because my wife wanted to try something that would help her<br />get to sleep. Oz recomended Rooisbos tea.  I tried it today at lunch.  It smells<br />very earth like - sorta like somewhat like a good pipe tobacco but not. Nice smell.<br />the Tea is red and better than most teas I have drank.  It is 10 times better than any green tea which I consider foofoo dishwater.  I liked China Balck Liche tea which is<br />bold smoothed by the leche plant but that is high test.  The Rooibos tea is sort of<br />nicely bold, smooth, pleasant with a earthy aroma - got better as you drink it.  It<br />was a love affair.  After reading a South African review on another lessor Roosibos tea,<br />he sujested Numi Roosibos so I will try it next.  I hope it is as good as this brand.

review/summary: Vigo Black Beans and Rice - a Tasty 30 Minute Meal
review/text: This product is a staple at our house. My family loves it. If you are a fan of dirty rice and beans or black beans in general, I think you will like it too. Prepare according to package directions. I add a chopped onion and 1/2 pound of Echrich Smoked Beef sausage, diced. If you want to stretch it even further, add a handful of rice. Everything goes in the pot at the same time. In 25 minutes it is ready to eat. It serves as a hearty main dish for three or as a side dish for a larger family. This is a mildly spicy dish. A few dashes of Tabasco will kick it up for those that like it hot.<br /><br />I was thrilled to see Vigo Black Beans and Rice on Amazon's grocery list. Where I live, this product is hard to find. Amazon had a great price too!

review/text: I love this and just wish it was sold in bigger packages.  I like to make it in advance and put it in separate containers to microwaver for lunches at work (with added sausage or chicken).  However, at roughly @2.39 - $2.79 per package (retail) it only makes a healthy 2 servings, even though it's rated for four.  A bigger package would allow me to buy fewer packages and make several lunches at a time.  This has an excellent seasoning patina and I love it !!  Quickly becoming a staple as the last reviewer mentioned.

review/summary: We LOVE This Product
review/text: Vigo Black Beans and Rice make an excellent side dish.  We find it is flavorful, and easy to prepare. It was an instant hit at our house and has become a favorite side dish, especially when served with salsa and (low fat) sour cream - - - oh, so good!<br /><br />Our only concern is the high sodium content. I have high blood pressure and need to keep my sodium intake under 2300 grams per day. At 950 grams per serving (scant four per bag), it is well over 1/3 of my daily sodium allotment.  So, if you have to be careful of your salt as well, budget sodium carefully when planning this for dinner.<br /><br />However, the high fiber (5 grams per serving) and low fat (1 gram per serving) content make this well worth being careful the rest of the day. It is also a perfect side dish when on Weight Watchers - I seem to remember it is only 2 points per serving.<br /><br />We cook it in a large, low-sided sauce pan. When it's ready and has cooled for 5-8 minutes, we use a knife to divide the rice and beans into 4 (almost) even sections. We find that one section per meal is perfect, whether for lunch or dinner. When I worked, I would fix it often enough so I could take it to work with broiled chicken, the afore-mentioned sour cream and salsa, and greens. Every day. Perhaps a little too same old, same old for some of you, but I loved it.<br /><br />If you're still not sure, buy just one bag and give it a try. When you cook it, be sure to add the olive oil as per the instructions; it adds to the flavor and texture of the beans.

review/summary: Not the same recipe as before - too salty
review/text: I have been using Sun Madras curry powder for almost 30 years. It is (or was) the only Indian-type curry powder I have (had) ever used. I tried a lot of different brands over the years, both powder and paste, but Sun Madras always filled my kitchen with a beautiful, round, warm curry smell. I bought this item knowing it was a ton of curry powder, but I always bragged about how good it was to friends and family and they always loved my different curries. I thought I could break the cans up into smaller amounts to give away.<br /><br />Not doing that now. This is not the same Sun Madras I have always used. It lacks the fragrance and richness of the previous cans I have purchased. It is also too salty. I always had to add a little  salt to the "older recipe" powder, but adding salt to the curry I made with this stuff ruined it. I should have known it was different when I put it in the pan. It was not as yellowish-orange as it usually is, more like a grayish color. It also did not release the same fragrance as I was sauteeing it.<br /><br />The back of the can says it is a product of "American Marketing Team, Inc." which may explain the difference. I suspect they bought the rights to the brand name and immediately started adding salt and other cheaper materials to reach some kind of ROI goal.<br /><br />Yeah, I know all this sounds kind of whiny ("Hey, it's only curry powder...") but this is a brand of spice I've had in my cabinet for a very long time and on which I have always relied.  Other cooks out there will appreciate what I'm saying. Now I've got to find a new curry powder.....

review/summary: Excellent Stuff!
review/text: Although the Sun Brand Madras curry powder tastes a little different from other brands that were listed on Amazon a couple of years ago, this stuff is still excellent! It has a slightly deeper orange hue than other Madras curries I've come across, so don't be too surprised if your curry isn't as yellow. If you purchased the Roland curries (red, cylindrical container; also in 1 pound lots), be aware that the Sun Brand is a little saltier and spicier so you won't need to use as much!<br /><br />I love making curried chicken legs with an apple jelly-based sauce, and this brand of powder goes just as well as the others I've tried. If you plan on following recipes from Cuisine at Home and other similar publications, you're going to need a *lot* of curry, and purchasing through Amazon is the best (and cheapest) method available. I typically purchase between 4 and 8 pounds every year or two from Amazon, and nothing makes for a better method of entertaining guests than an exotic (but not quite Indian) dish with an American twist!<br /><br />Edit: It seems some other reviews mention the strong, salty flavor of this curry. I don't notice it so much for what I use it for, but if you're trying to watch your sodium intake, be aware that this curry might contain FAR more sodium than you'd expect. I'd strongly recommend looking for the Roland Madras curry (you can search for that exact term--but be aware that it isn't often listed because it's VERY popular stuff) as it is of superior quality and flavor. This stuff makes an excellent substitute, though.<br /><br />Also, I neglected to notice a comment to my review some one year ago requesting the recipe I mentioned. Assuming I don't get slapped with a DMCA take down by the magazine I borrowed it from (and modified), I've attached it in the comments to this review.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I've been using this curry for 25 years--I first saw it used at a Chinese restaurant I used to go to, and I copied their recipe. It is not as fiery as most Madras curry powders, so my kids like it. No sharp or off tastes--very smooth. The 4 pack of one pound tins from Amazon is an amazing deal--I've paid $7/lb when I can find Sun Brand, and other websites charge around $9/lb, and the 4 oz. tins are even more expensive, usually $3/tin (or $12/lb) in stores and other websites..

review/text: I have had trouble finding a good spicy hot curry powder in Colorado, so I was delighted to find this.  Since it didn't say 'hot' I was afraid it wouldn't be hot enough, but that wasn't a problem.  Yes, it is high in sodium, but I just don't add any more salt to my curries and use much less in cooking the rice to go with it than I might with a less salty curry powder.

review/summary: The BEST, Most Flavorful, Mild Curry
review/text: We have been using this brand of curry for 20 years.  Haven't found one that compares.  Spicy but not too hot.  Well rounded flavor.  No need to add salt (check for sodium conscious dieters).<br /><br />Makes a great "Country Captain" or use for chicken or tuna salad sandwiches.  Also great added to a Waldorf-type of salad.<br /><br />Try this with chicken:<br />Preheat oven to 450.<br />Put a big splash of olive oil in a pan and arrange trimmed pieces of chicken with the skin on.  (It keeps the chicken moist and the skin turns out wonerfully crispy.)<br />Powder the chicken VERY liberally with Sun Brand Curry.  Don't be shy.<br />Bake the chicken for 20 minutes at 450.<br />Lower temp to 350 and bake another 20 minutes.<br />Check for doneness (may need another 5-10 minutes for closely spaced or large pieces of chicken.<br />Serve with rice (or noodles), spooning juices from the pan over the rice.

review/text: Although I did not grow up in India, and have no idea what a 'proper curry powder' should taste like, I have to say that this is my new favorite. I have tried quite a few other US-based brands, and none of them even comes close to the perfectly balanced and nicely rounded flavor this curry imparts. It is not too hot, not too sweet, and does not cast too long a shadow over the foods it is used in. Great stuff - I cannot recommend it highly enough.

The price per use is greatly reduced in this package, and I use enough to make it worthwhile, but if you don't have a deep pantry and you're going to eat this type of curry once a year, buy the smaller can. Spices don't last forever.

review/text: I used to consume Sun Brand Curry Powder for years since it was the best but not any longer since I mix my own curry powder and the main ingredient that I use more than all others, is turmeric and more importantly I want to avoid sodium which is added in all spices regardless of the brand. No wonder everyone is selling turmeric in pills since it has such a high nutritional value, manganese 26%, iron 16%, phytosterol 5.5 and most importantly inflammation factor of 1,523; all in one tablespoon. No need to consume pills since I put few spoons of this gold beauty turmeric into my dishes for its health benefits. Sun Brand curry powder has some 30 spices. If you are after a spice mix Sun Brand is the best but certainly with noticeable sodium. Bravo.

I was so wrong and wish I trusted the honest negative reviews.  Simply put, it is way way way too salty.  I put one table spoon and had to pour over three cups of water just to make it edible.  By then, it was not curry anymore.  I just ordered Roland brand I had before which is faithful and good flavor(I could put as much curry as I want it to be without being salty).  I now have 6 cans of this curry flavored salt....  I will have to dump it somewhere in the garbage!!!  Don't buy this!!!
