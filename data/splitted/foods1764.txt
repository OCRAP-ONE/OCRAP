review/summary: CAUTION BEFORE YOU BUY!
review/text: I am sitting here watching my dog completely sound asleep after a $600 emergency vet visit.  We did as instructed with this toy last night and sat with our Pit/Mastif 17month old puppy named Daisy.  She loved it and today we went out for two hours to look at homes to buy.  When we returned she did her usual running around and greeting us with her new toy in her mouth.  Several minutes later she was laying at our feet with her toy still there.  While reaching out to grab the toy and play with her it was stuck.  I mean stuck.  She had literally gotten her entire lower jaw stuck in the hole that you take in and out to place the food into.  Not a tooth not a hair, her entire jaw.  I cannot believe that this is the first occurance for this toy.  It definately needs some redesign or removal from market.  This toy has cut a ring around her jaw to the point of bleeding and massive swelling because of how it was lodged.  We bought the large version as HELLO we have a large dog.  If you really care for your pet, look elsewhere for a toy that does keep them entertained when you are not around.  It kept our baby entertained alright.  But she couldn't eat or drink as she walked around with a 6 inch cube stuck to the front of her face.  We feel pathetic that we did this to her.

review/summary: Dog loves this thing
review/text: There's not a whole lot to say about this toy. It's simple, and does what it's designed to do. My wife had a little trouble figuring out how to open it, but she has trouble opening the front door. Once you get past that small hurdle, you put food in it and close it; simple. But the dog loves it and gets about an hours worth of play kicking this thing around in order to get the treats. She likes it far more than any of the other food/toys that we have. Great investment.

review/text: The Buster Cube and the Mini Cube is a great idea! The problem is that I almost broke all of my ten fingers, trying to get the inner cylinder out (for cleaning purpose). I let several people try it, because I thought there might be a trick...none of them was successful! I even went to Petsmart where they sell that toy. Needless to say that nobody there was successful as well. I ended up sending it back and putting some ice on my hurt fingers!!! 2 Stars for the idea...

review/summary: Don't Be Without a Buster Cube!
review/text: I bought a mini buster cube for my miniature dachshund to help build up his rear leg muscles a few months after he had back surgery.  All I had to do was put a few pieces of his dry dog food in it and he figured it out quick.  It's 7 years later and it's still his favorite toy.  He can even pick it up with his mouth and carry it around the house.  He puts it in his dog house and bangs it around for hours.  He literally plays by himself and keeps busy all day in the yard too.  He doesn't even care that I stopped putting food in it years ago.  I had a few of these break after wear from the rocks in my last yard but I keep about 5 at a time in my house in case the company decides not to make them anymore.  I bought one for my friend's pomeranian and he doesn't stop playing with it either.  He now has two.

review/text: My dog is picky and doesn't eat his food in a bowl, but the buster cube solved all of that. This keeps him busy, exercised and happy. We fill it up two times a day for him.<br />The only down side is filling the cube. You have to put the food in the hole, shake it for the food to slide through a hole on the side, and keep adding food. The whole process takes about 1.5 minute, which isn't too bad.<br />I recommend this to all dog owners.

review/summary: Loved it at first, but it's not very sanitary
review/text: I received the mini buster cube and my mini schnauzer had tons of fun with it. I put his kibble dinner in it and he tossed it around and got most of it out. However, over time I could hear that food "dust" was being left behind, and I found this product absolutely impossible to open and clean.<br /><br />I tried to open with the instructions many times, asked different people for help, but the opening on the mini cube is so small that I couldn't really get my thumb in there (as the instructions recommend).<br /><br />It was left unused for a bit and then one day when I picked up a small swarm of flies flew out of it! It was so disgusting I ended up throwing it away.<br /><br />If you can manage to open it and clean it, this would be a perfect toy. Perhaps people have better luck with larged sized cube because it might be easier to open, but that one is much too big for my little dog.

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:31 Mins<br /><br /></span>We give half of Bo's dinner in his bowl and the other half in the Cube and it's been really effective at keeping him occupied and slowing how fast he eats. There was a learning curve of a couple hours - I suggest when introducing it use really tasty treats and kick it around a few times to show there's good stuff coming out. With patience I imagine most dogs will pick it up. The biggest downside, and it's not really much of one, is that it can be a noisy process with the dog nosing the thing around on the floor and banging it into walls, chairs, etc., to get the kibble out.

review/summary: My dogs are special needs or just stupid.
review/text: The concept is terrific and I loved the ability to layer different flavors to keep the dogs interested.  I ended up kicking the toy around in order to get their attention and they only ate what fell out.  My darling idiots aren't able to put the concept of their effort resulting in treats by nosing or pawing the toy around.  The device would probably work well for smarter dogs, however, my dogs are just stupid.  One more toy they don't understand.  I give up.  Oh well, my dogs entertain themselves by digging holes, breaking into the trash can and being loveable idiots. I KNOW there is a toy or two out there that matches their very low IQ and curiosity so I will continue to search.  Good luck to all of you with more advanced IQ dogs.

review/summary: Best Toy for Active Dogs
review/text: This toy is my dogs absolute favorite. He goes nuts whenever we take it out. I put an entire meal inside and it keep him occupied for at least 20 minutes. The hard plastic has a potential to do a number on your wood furniture and floors. My dog figured out if he drops it down the stairs, the food comes out faster. On the other hand, the hard plastic is what makes this so durable. I have a STRONG chewer. Very few toys last around our mutt but this lasted a couple years with frequesnt use. Yes it's hard to clean but at that point, wear and tear required a new one anyways. We are on our second and it remains a favorite in our house.

review/summary: Sturdiest Food Dispensing Dog Toy We've Tried
review/text: We have a 9 month old lab mix puppy who is extremely high energy-- even with 4 miles or more worth of walks per day he has lots of excess energy.  We've taken to serving his meals solely out of food-dispensing toys as it keeps him entertained and makes him think. This is the 6th food dispensing toy we've tried and it's the one that has lasted the longest and seems to take him the longest amount of time to get all of the kibble out of it, though he can still empty it pretty fast!<br />We've tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DK26M">Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball, Large</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005TRBTAY">Omega Tricky Treat Ball Soccer</a> both of which worked pretty well but broke after prolonged use.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ALMW0M">Kong Wobbler Dog Toy</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GE8OV6">Busy Buddy Twist n' Treat LARGE</a> were chewed apart pretty quickly and were useless after that. And our dog figured out that if he just tipped the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KV7ZGQ">Premier Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug, Medium/Large</a> with the opening down he could dump most of the kibble out without doing any work and consequently he would be able to get all the kibble out within seconds.<br />With the large Buster Food Cube, though, there really isn't any way he can get the kibble out without actually rolling it around, and it has lasted quite a while.  It's made out of hard plastic so it can be pretty loud when used on a hard surface. We've mainly been having him use it outside on the grass though, so it's quieter and it's less likely that he'll break it by dropping it as opposed to if he used it on a hard surface.  When he wants a refill, though, he'll drop it on the metal door sill, which he does quite a lot, and it has still held up fine.  When you receive the cube it says on the package that you should get a size that will be too big to fit in your dog's mouth, probably to avoid the toy from breaking because of being dropped or chewed on.  The first couple of days our dog used it he wasn't able to fit it in his mouth, however, after that he managed to figure out how to pick it up (maybe he stretched out his jaw muscles? Ha ha).  We bought the large size cube and he is a 50 or 55 lb lab mix so bigger dogs will probably be able to fit it in their mouths too, or maybe our dog just has a really big mouth.  So far it hasn't been a problem at all, though, other than that it's pretty loud when he drops it from his mouth. If we see him chewing on it when there's nothing in it we just put it away until the next meal time, but the hard plastic seems like it isn't very appealing to chew on, so that isn't much of a problem.  Wiping off the cube is also easy, as opposed to with other treat balls that have ridges where dirt and such can get stuck.<br />When you pour the kibble or treats in the cube you kind of have to cover the hole with your hand and shake the cube a little so that the food will go down into the cube and not just sit by the entrance and fall out immediately.<br />On a final note, this type of toy might not be for all dogs-- we tried to get our other dog, who is 8 years old, to use it, and she couldn't figure it out even though we kept showing her how to use it-- she would just eat the food that came out when I rolled it around and then stare at me expectantly, waiting for me to make more food come out of it.  We already knew the puppy seemed to be more intelligent than the 8 year old dog though, even though we still love our clueless doggy!

review/summary: Good idea, but didn't work for us
review/text: This is a great idea, however the center came loose and my dog got his lower jaw stuck in it and had to go to the vet to have it removed,so for future and current owners the mini centers seemed to have a problem with coming loose easily and with treats inside dogs will quickly get stuck even while supervised(in less than 30 seconds while I tried to get it from him he was stuck)<br /><br />Before all of the commotion though he seemed to love it. He also was not hurt but had to be sedated to have it removed. I did follow the manufacturer's directions I guess it just wasn't in there tight enough which could have been my fault or a manufacturing error with the cube's locking mechanism, the vet was not sure, this is not so much a negative review on the cube but more a warning to other owners to make sure it's in tightly and don't leave your pup unsupervised with it.

review/text: I got this for our Cairn terrier puppy, as they are smart and good at getting into things.  He LOVES this toy!  His puppy kibble was a bit small for the opening, but we got some bigger food, and he's got to knock, scoot, and tumble the toy in order for the food to come out.  While it's noisy on tile, the pup is entertained for 20 min at least and we know where he is!  So the pup gets excercise, gets to "figure out" the cube, and gets a treat all at once.

review/summary: hard plastic toy - a few years later
review/text: We bought this for our 4 month old terrier (15lb). The thing I like best about this toy is that it fits his small puppy dog food, so I can just insert his day-to-day food without worrying about his diet being affected. It is HARD plastic so it is not a chew toy for his teeth like some of the other puzzles, and on our hardwood floors it can make a bit of a racket causing me to wonder about the scratch factor on the floors (but, oh well we have a dog AND kids).  Our pup was scared of it for the first few weeks due to the noise it makes but now it is one of his favorite puzzle toys. It has two settings: easy pour and somewhat easy pour.  Because of the hard plastic he really has to rely on the use of his front paws to get the food out rather than just his mouth (although he has mastered picking it up now.) It is a fun toy for him and a good thing to have around when he is restless and looking for trouble.<br /><br />Aug 2012 Update: Our terrier is now 25lb and he still loves this toy. It remains a good size for him even though he grew much bigger than we expected. He gets super excited whenever we pull it out.  He is fearful of thunderstorms and we use it as a positive reinforcement tool when the skies grey and the wind picks up.  He gets distracted by the puzzle ball and forgets all about the weather.  It is too big (or maybe it is too loud and too hard in texture) for our 8lb dog - she will not play with it even though she wants the food inside.

review/text: This is MY favorite dog toy because it keeps my dog entertained for at least 20-30 minutes at a time.  It holds more food than many other treat-dispensing toys and takes a long time to dispense all the treats.  The large size means that the toy doesn't get into small spaces, which would only frustrate the dog and require assistance to get out.  The square shape takes more concentration and skill which smarter dogs will enjoy.  The solid construction and rounded corners make this toy virtually indestructible, even for heavy chewers.

review/text: Abbey, our new puppy, is obviously intelligent.  Regular toys just weren't quite cutting it for her.  And she didn't care for Kongs because they were too easy for her to figure out.  This toy, however, has been incredibly effective for her.  She figured out how to work to get the food out extremely quickly.  However, using the hardest setting, she has to work for half of her breakfast and half of her dinner throughout the day.<br /><br />I also have had no problem pulling out the center piece.  It's really easy.  (I'm not sure why other people have difficulties with that...it's really simple.)<br /><br />Best purchase.<br /><br />*Update: This is Abbey's favorite toy.  It keeps her entertained for about 30 minutes.  Our older chihuahua even loves it and follows behind to pick up any loose pieces that Abbey misses.  This beats out the Kong any day of the week.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I was disappointed with the cube. It is almost impossible to open. Finally I used the handle of a pair of pliers, after seeing a video on youtube, and I tore up the handle of the pliers opening it, it was that hard. The kibble either doesn't come out, and my dog gets frustrated and barks, or it comes out 5 pieces at once, and I have to refill it all the time. It also slides along the ground more often than it rolls over to dispense kibble. Maybe that's because my dog is too small to roll it? He's 6 pounds.<br /><br />One more thing, the instructions both on the product and Buster Cube's website refer to "min" and "max" settings. There is no such thing on the cube, only "lock" and "unlock" settings.<br /><br />My dog loves it though, so it gets 3 stars.

I thought I'd try a different kibble ball as a replacement. The Buster Mini Cube is made of hard plastic and makes a lot of noise when the dog rolls it onto the linoleum kitchen floor and into chair legs, furniture, etc. It's also a cube (true to its name) and gets stuck in corners. Maybe it's because my dog first learned how to get treats out of the Omega Treat Ball, which is round and made of softer material, but he definitely didn't have as much fun with the Buster Mini Cube. He also liked to carry the Omega Treat Ball around in his mouth, and the Buster Mini Cube is too large and square for him to do so. I just purchased another Omega Treat Ball and expect it will remain his favorite kibble ball.

Otherwise I don't recommend this for at least the Sheltie breed.

review/summary: Our favorite puppy toy, and arguably second-best investment we made!
review/text: We absolutely love the Buster Cube, as does our dog Jack!  This is easily our favorite toy of his, and arguably the second best item we've bought for him (his crate being #1).<br /><br />When we first got the Buster Cube, it distracted him for 30 minutes at a time.  Not only does it challenge his mind, but it forces him to eat slower so he digests better.  We pretty much put his entire dinner in there now!<br /><br />He loves the cube as well, and views it as a treat now, in and of itself!  (i.e. He'll "beg" for it, and even roll it around when there's no treats in it.)<br /><br />Since then he's gotten much faster at getting the food out, so we have been slowly dialing up the difficulty.  (There is a dial that increases/decreases the food reservoir.)<br /><br />Some tips:  It's really noisy if your dog plays with it on tiling, and it slides around more than it rolls.  So if the noise bothers you or if you want to make it easier for your dog, have hir play with it on carpeting.<br /><br />Also, it helps to play with it in an area where the cube won't accidentally roll underneath dressers or down the stairs or get wedged into a corner.  (Although, through these kinds of mistakes, Jack has figured out how to avoid them.)<br /><br />The most important thing, as mentioned in the included instructions, is to make make sure your dog quickly gets food out of it and realizes there's more to be had. Even the very first time we tried the Buster Cube, Jack was completely focused and involved. :)<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />We've had this over a month now, and now the full-size Buster Cube is our favorite -- our dog outgrew the mini as his meals got bigger and it took longer and longer for us to pack them into the mini.<br /><br />If we ever got another puppy, I'd also use the small-sized Cube in between the mini and the large.  The Cubes are awesome, but let them grow with your pet. :)

review/summary: Keeps Puppy Busy
review/text: Busy puppies are less apt to get in trouble.  I have a 3 month old lab puppy who will do anything for a treat.  Sometime I just need him to be busy so I can finish the dishes or clean up.  I put some kibble in his cube and off he goes.  He paws at it and pushes it with his nose then looks to see if anything comes out.  Perfect little distraction until I'm ready to play with him again!

review/text: I got this toy for my puppy and he LOVES it. I agree with other reviewers that it is a 'must have' toy. However, the inner cylinder pops out occasionally on our tile floor It works better for him outdoors. It is also a bit difficult to load and adjust. I am very satisfied, overall, with the product because it keeps him entertained.

review/summary: Great for active dogs
review/text: I got this cube after my vet recommended it.  I have a border collie Alaskan husky puppy.  Both breeds are high energy, so she is very active. My vet said that this toy will help with mental stimulation.  My puppy loves it.  The minute she sees it in our hands she gets all excited.  When we put food in it and shake it she goes nuts.  One thing that is really nice about this is that you can make it harder.  I think this is a great toy, and my puppy uses almost every single day.

review/summary: Way better things out there
review/text: My dog loves interactive toys and it seems its the only way I can get her to actually eat her meals.  I bought this thing (mini size) with high hopes but once I got it in its done nothing but disappoint.  First of all I think I may have a defective product since there is absolutely no way I can get the middle cylinder out.  I looked this up online and it seems numerous others are having this problem.  Therefore strike 1: can't clean the thing which I can see getting gunky real fast.  Fine I can't remove the cylinder, maybe I'll just throw some small treats in there and see how she likes it.  Put it on the hardwood floor and BAM BAM BAM BAM it goes.  Try constantly  throwing a slightly heavy plastic object at your furniture, walls, and floor...my neighbors are going to freak!  Strike 2: SO LOUD.  Ok, maybe its because I can't take the cylinder out/defective but after five minutes of banging not a single treat has fell out and my dog is getting frustrated.  Fine its the human's turn...okay I'm shaking, I'm turning, I'm shaking, I'm turning, now I'm peeking through the hole and shaking and shaking and shaking....NOTHING.  Seriously?  I had to maneuver the cube (the thing is set at minimum difficulty) and could only get one of the treats out after doing some pretty delicate turns and rotations.  Hows my dog suppose to do that with her nose and mouth?  Strike 3: treat dispenser that doesn't dispense treats.  Maybe the thing keeping my cylinder from coming out is keeping treats from coming out as well.  Doesn't matter...I'm over it.

review/summary: Gaming for Cats, too
review/text: I purchased a small buster cube for one of my cats, who is an expert at quickly deciphering puzzle treat dispensers. The ones that merely require tipping or rolling a ball are too easy, and the Nina Ottoson puzzles are conquered in less than ten minutes. However, more than six months later, this cat probably spends an hour each day occupied by the Buster Cube, deftly rolling it over the rounded corners to shake out his breakfast.<br /><br />No other puzzle toy I've met can keep clever animals occupied for as long as the Buster Cube. My cat is definitely less anxious and restless since getting it. I just wish that they made a version that was easier to clean, and perhaps even chew-proof (I wouldn't leave the hard plastic unattended with a hard-chewing rottweiler, for example). Now that we're getting a new puppy, the Buster Cube is the first toy on my list.

review/text: I bought one of these for my Siberian husky house dog. She recovered from a serious injury and cannot romp and play with other dogs. This toy helps keep her entertained. It is tough and can take the abuse of a husky batting it around the house. It is challenging for her to get the treats out, and it can be set from easy to harder, so you can make it easy at first, till the dog gets the idea, and then make it harder so it is more challenging. I've had several other puzzle/food dispenser type toys for her and this is the best one, hands down.

review/summary: NOT good for big dogs, plug comes out too easily
review/text: My smartphone accidentally ordered this item for me at 2:30 AM while I was asleep.  There was a reboot and software reload that night and I guess amazon was recommending this on my screen.  Anyhow I had it for 2 days while trying to find a post office that would accept it and take it back to amazon since *I* did not order it.<br /><br />Looking at the product, it has weaknesses.  I did not let my German Shepherd Dog play with the toy as she is pretty destructive.  The first problem I identified is that the plug that keeps the food inside and lets it dribble out at a slow rate does not secure itself well enough to prevent a clever dog from getting the plug "unplugged".  Basically the detent is not firm enough to hold the plug in place.<br /><br />It's also not sturdy enough for big dog roughhousing - thin wall brittle plastic construction, loose plug (which once removed will get chewed to pieces), and a small gap that will not let big dog food fall down the tube make it useless for big dogs and their oversize kibble.  The cube is pretty big (5-6") for small dogs with 1/4" kibble which is what it is really deisnged for.  My dog's 5/8" funky shaped kibble would never go down the chute and would piss off the dog.<br /><br />So too small for a large dog for which it is sized, and too big for a little dog which makes it wrong-sized except for the mid size (15-30) lb dogs which would probably have a good time playing with it provided the owners make sure the plug stays in place-it rotates out too easily.  Eventually the brittle plastic will crack - depending on the dog the crack may be sniffed out as an alternate route to the food supply, and depending on the teeth the crack may become large enough to get kibble out of.<br /><br />I had already bought the LARGE KONG <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ALMW0M">Kong Wobbler Dog Toy</a> toy and took a knife to carve out the opening so large kibble would come out ok without fustrating the dog.  When the dog knows there is food inside they will become irate, and get into trouble trying to figure a way into the food.  Pretty soon the kong goes flying, hurled by an energetic dog fustrated with getting to the treat, which is what brought out the knife to open up the hole it falls from.  Dog and Kong are doing fine now that the food comes out ok.  I don't like the food chute on the cube design - as an engineer I feel it is flawed from the beginning.  I don't really like the kong either because it screws together the top and bottom halves.  Dogs seem to understand threaded connections after a few trys even without opposable thumbs.  A good grip and bite will unscrew a kong especially with a big mouthed dog, e.g. a german shepherd!

review/text: This was a great toy for my beagle, who immediately figured it out and nosed the cube all around the house while the kibble dribbled out.  Not so for my pit mix, who didn't have the patience for such antics. Instead she just tried to bite it in half.  It didn't take took long for her to be able to do just that.  Although I will say the buster cube has lasted longer than some similar interactive toys which took her seconds to destroy, it's now unusable like the rest.

review/summary: A Stomach Saver  - and tons of fun!
review/text: When we adopted our dog, she had a variety of medical problems, "intestinal turbulence" chief among them.  She was a competitive eater, wolfing down her food in seconds, which contributed to the problem.  This toy not only engaged her mentally and physically, it forced her to eat slowly, which has helped her digestion tremendously.  She is absolutely bonkers for it.  She spins in delighted circles whenever we pull it out.  She creates obstacle courses for herself while rolling it around, and leaves pieces of kibble behind to be rediscovered later once the cube is empty.  In other words, she has added her own layers to the game.  The best part is, if we feed her in her regular bowl now, she eats much more slowly, as the cube has taught her to take her time with her food.  This is a very, very durable toy - the first food puzzle toy she hasn't broken.  The only negative is that it is very loud, so don't use it in the same room where you're trying to watch television, or have a conversation, or think. :-)  I find it extremely fun to watch our dog play with the cube for the 20-40 minutes it takes for her to empty it, so I don't mind the noise.  Highly recommend.

review/text: This took a little longer for my dog to use because it doesn't roll as easily as his other treat toys.  However, my dog enjoys making a lot of noise when playing so this is good for that.

I usually switch him out to a quiet rubber toy after a while but this toy is still great to get out his fixation with making noise.

review/summary: Challenging & fun but limited use for non-kibble feeders
review/text: Must-have product for dogs that eat kibble.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />  * Good quality; solid construction; good quality plastic; smooth edges<br /><br />  * Nice-looking/ attractive design<br /><br />  * Challenging!  Square shape requires dog to work hard in order to earn treats<br /><br />  * Adjustable difficulty level - you may turn the inner cylinder to adjust "flow" of treats<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />  * Plastic is hard and *noisy*. Apartment dwellers may have downstairs neighbors complain.<br /><br />  * Hard to clean. As others mentioned, the middle cylinder is virtually impossible to remove.<br /><br />  * Limited use.  It's pretty much designed for kibble.  Odd-shaped treats get stuck at the bottom.<br /><br />IMO this toy is GREAT for folks who feed kibble since it provides a challenging game that will keep dogs occupied.<br /><br />Since I feed my dog a raw diet I fill the cube with irregularly shaped food items (dehydrated beef/ liver/ chicken, jerky, etc.).  Unfortunately these don't fare well in the Buster Cube.  A better option is the Tug-a-Jug with the rope totally removed.<br /><br />I like the Buster Cube but can only give it 3 stars based on the size limitation of stuffable items.  Having to cut treats into small pieces so they "flow" through the toy is frustrating and time-consuming.

review/summary: Good toy
review/text: We got one of these in large size for our Australian Cattle Dog mix, and he loves it.  We use it each night (sometimes in combo with other similar products) to feed him his dinner.  The cube can hold a full cup of kibble.  It's entertaining to watch him "herd" it all over the den and it keeps him busy while we prepare or eat our own supper.  I agree with the earlier comment about the settings being "easy" and "slightly less easy."  I wish it were a little more challenging, but it's still a great toy.

review/summary: Buster Mini Cube dog
review/text: I had looked for a dog toy that would hold dog kibbles so that I did not need to purchase a specialized dog treat.  This one holds dog kibbles.  You just drop them in the hole and shake a little to get the kibbles into a compartment.  You can turn to adjust it to minimize or maximize the ability to get the kibbles.  I have a small dog (8to 10 lbs.) and it took a bit of time over several days of me pushing it for him to catch on.  But he did catch on and can roll to get kibbles, sometime one, sometime more.  He will get frustrated when the kibbles don't come out, but I would say it's a good item.  Entertaining until they run low, but you do not want them eating too much.  It can equal a meal.  It's a once a day toy or....

review/summary: Buster Cube is entertaining for dog and owner!
review/text: I really believe this is a very useful and must have "toy" for your dog. Our morning ritual now consists of filling the cube with our dogs normal hard dog food when we have our breakfast. This keeps them very entertained. It also makes them think they're hunting for their food since bits fall out as they push the cube around. You will enjoy watching them entertain themselves.

review/text: Be aware, my spaniel will not do bathroom business IF he gets this thing outside.  I bought this for my one year old cocker spaniel.  He loves it.  I was so surprised at how fast he learned to roll the cube; one piece of dog food fell out and he was rolling this thing across the house for more.  Of course, I short his meals and feed about 1/2 his dry dog food via the cube.  I have four dogs, so this thing has caused some fights.  So, I ordered more and extra for my friends.  Save your sanity, just get two (one to play with and one on standby).

review/summary: Great Item
review/text: I've been very happy the the cube. We received it before it was supposed to which was great! We have a 20lb Dachsund/Terrier/Beagle Mix. Seems to be a decent size but he can pull the whole thing in his mouth so we are trying to teach him to smack it around instead of just chewing on the whole thing. The crazy guy has also figured out how to pull the cork part open. We were recommended this from our trainer and she said she has never had a dog figure that out. It only took him about 20 mins to do so now we just watch him very carefully. I wish I could find a medium size but I'm not sure they make one in the size I need. I still give it a five star because I can finally eat a meal in peace.

I tried it with tiny treats, it made no difference.<br /><br />I tried a few different times, we couldn't get treats out of it, so the dogs quickly lost interest.

review/text: This is definitely a step up from the IQ ball as far as the level of difficulty.  My Border Collie was very frustrated by it for the first few week, so he barked at it incessantly! Now he has fun with it, and it keep him busy, giving him a "job" to do.  I really wish this were made of a hard rubbery material like the Kong toys, as the hard plastic makes it very noisy when my dog knocks it around on the hardwood floors, trying to get the treats out. Consequently, I can't let him play with it while I'm teaching piano lessons!

review/summary: Good product, just not right for me
review/text: I bought the mini size buster cube thinking it would work for my little mutt (15lb beagle/pom mix) since I had seen other reviews mentioning how much their small breed dogs loved it. Maybe it works better in a home with carpeting, but it turned out that it was too large for my little girl (who is insanely food-motivated)to flip over easily on a consistent basis (the flooring is too slick so when she put her paw on it to flip it over, it just skidded around). She ended up batting it all over my hardwood floors like her old twist-n-treat toy , and was decidedly frustrated that she couldn't get anything out. It's also much too big for her to carry around in her mouth (and she'll carry/chew just about anything she can get her teeth on).<br /><br />It's a great idea, and a great product...I just wish it came in a smaller size (and was easier to access for cleaning). We'll be trying a puzzle ball next.

review/summary: Great toy to challenge my dog
review/text: We bought the large size for our ~65 pound labrador retriever.  He had been really bored and we wanted to find something to challenge and stimulate him.  It took a little while for him to figure it out.  At first he just pushed it around on the carpet and didn't understand that he had to roll it.  Then we took it outside, and the grass naturally caused it to roll over more, and he got the idea.  Now we feed him half of his food in it.  We think he really enjoys it.  He has tried to bite it a bit, and so far it's held up well but will always be a supervised toy.  The center piece is easy to remove for cleaning.

review/summary: BEWARE!  Dangerous to Dogs
review/text: We had one of these cubes for 3 years for our English Springer Spaniel. He loved it. One day he got his canine tooth stuck in the round insert. He immediately began howling in pain.  He was howling so loudly while my husband and I safely detached it. I have never heard my dog cry this way before, or since then. We immediately threw away the cube.  By the way, the cube was not damaged when it caught his canine tooth.  It was a freak occurrence, but one we would never chance again.  We were lucky.

review/summary: Shepherd and Cattle Dog Love It!
review/text: We bought the large cube because of our 97lb. German Shepherd mix, and we also have a Cattle Dog mix (35lbs). They both LOVE this thing. Put some regular dog food in it, and the boys race to see who gets to play with it first. Usually our shepherd gets it, so we give our other boy another toy (monster ball, which I also recommend). This thing has taken a beating over the last couple of months. Our big boy can pick it up in his mouth and carry it, throws it up in the air (it's really loud when it hits the ground) throws it down the stairs, jumps on it... anything to get that last piece of dog food out! It definitely keeps them busy. I've also washed it in the dishwasher because with that much play, this thing does get really dirty. It has a couple gouges out of the plastic because I have caught my big boy starting to chew on it when he gets frustrated- which is why I would not recommend leaving this alone with your doggie. You never know what could happen, even though it looks totally safe. (Better safe than sorry, right?) I would highly recommend this toy for anyone who needs more mental stimulation for their dog!

review/summary: Finally a toy my dog can't break
review/text: I have a very destructive dog. She is an American Eskimo and is far too intelligent for normal toys. They bore her or she destroys them, generally within minutes.  Other treat dispenser toys, including the standard Kong, are too easy for her.  Enter, the Buster Cube.  I was recommended this toy from a local trainer who has had great luck with it.  For my dog, this is not a very difficult toy to figure out, although compared to other toys she has had, this has taken considerably longer for her to master. About 2 days in, she's able to flip the cube on soft carpet and turn it successfully until all of the food we put inside of it is gone.<br /><br />We enjoy feeding her meals with the cube, as it helps stimulate her mind, keeps her occupied, and feeds her all at the same time.  This is also one of the first toys that she can't just pick up, chew, crack, shred, or decapitate.  I love this and have suggested it to several other pet owners.

review/text: My lab loves the buster cube. It didnt take her long to figure out how to flip the cube to get the food to come out. There needs to be an "expert" or advanced dispensing setting because she can empty it now in under 2 min. I have had to buy several other interactive toys to keep her busy for a longer period of time.  My other dog has never figured out how to use it.  She just pushes it lightly which causes it to just slides across the floor without dispensing treats.  Its durable and my dog has not been able to break it.

review/summary: Good for a while, maybe better for smaller dogs
review/text: This is a pretty good idea, but might be better for smaller dogs. It's easy enough to pull out the middle and put food in, and it definitely kept my dog entertained. Food doesn't come out too easily, so he has to work for it.<br /><br />Unfortunately it didn't last all that long. My dog (~50lb pit) figured out how to pick it up by using the hole in the middle as a grip. He eventually did this enough that the middle piece started to crack and bulge out. Eventually it got hard to remove and replace the middle piece. Now I can't even lock the middle piece in, so it's useless. This thing is also pretty loud on any kind of surface other than a carpet.<br /><br />I would recommend for smaller dogs who won't be able to grip it by the center hole.

review/text: This is a good toy to keep your dog busy. However a little hard to get the opening loose to put the treats in. But then once you have the treats it keeps her busy (cairn terrier). Just make sure you put the lid/insert back in really good and tighten it. My dog got it loose and pulled it out and then chewed up the insert...which then leaves the ball part with no way to close it. SO just make sure the little plug thing is tight.

review/text: I picked up the Buster Cube after reading some positive reviews on it. Its a great toy, lots of fun and holds their attention for a long time. I put a handfull of kibble in it(an amount that my pup would eat in a couple bites) and he was occupied for at least a 30-45 minutes. I would 5 star it but it is its very noisy, even on carpeted floor, thats my only complaint.<br /><br />Update: The buster cube didn't make it through the weekend. My dog was able to remove the center piece, and then proceeded to chew on it while i was out of the room. Luckily I was only gone for a couple minutes and the center piece is still sort of functional. disappointing.

So I had quite the mess to clean up! I was hoping it would last a bit longer and keep him occupied while I was at work. I wanted a refund or to exchange for a different item but the company would only replace it! Which doesn't help! So now he can only play with it while i am sitting with him and watching him. So don't get it if your pup likes to chew at all.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Excellent cat food !
review/text: I got my cat at a shelter and they feed this to the cats there. My cat Wanda loves it. Never any waste and it makes for a cleaner litter box. Cuts stool odor down 90%. No dyes that can stain either. Keeps Wanda happy and very healthy.

review/summary: I love Hills!
review/text: My cat is picky, especially when it comes to dry food.  She will happily go days refusing to eat anything if I push a kibble she doesn't like on her (damn torties!.  I switched my cat from friskies to Hills Scienc Diet when she grew to adulthood.  Then I decided to try one of those natural diets, with no fillers, and only uses real meats and blah blah blah.  One she wouldn't go near, and the other she would eat reluctantly.  Except the super active, petite 7lb 4oz tortie grew to just over ten pounds, waddled when she walked, because she was horribly obese, and slept 24 hours a day, waking up only to eat, and her coat was staritng ot lose it's shine.  That scared the hell out of me!  So I switched back to Hills.  With a week, she was starting to show interest in toys again, and was already starting to lose that swaying flabby fat belly.  Now she's back down to 7lb 7oz, and very active, healthy, and happy.  I will NEVER switch her food again!

review/summary: Expensive, but it worked!
review/text: I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with "meal" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all.

review/summary: Great for pukey cat
review/text: My cat was born in August 2001, so he's almost 10 years old. Three years ago he started to throw up quite frequently. The vet ran tons of VERY EXPENSIVE tests and for the most part ruled out anything that can be treated. We tried changing food but nothing worked. I tried giving him home cooked food as well and that made throwing up even worse. So one day I was in a pet store and the clerk said he had the same problem with his cat and suggested the MOST EXPENSIVE FOOD IN STORE. I was skeptical but I had nothing to lose (but money). Three years later my cat is doing fantastic. He only throw up when I feel bad for him and give him tuna as a pity treat. He's healthy, bouncy and seems to enjoy food. The big bag lasts us for ever. We bought a bag on November 5th and today again on March 19. That's 4+ months for $40 (which is how much the bag costs in pet store). I think I can afford $10/month for my buddy. I have no idea what's in there and I don't really care. All I care is that my cat looks happy and healthy. Food purists who believe in feeding cat organic chicken and brown rice might not care for it.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever.

review/summary: stops fecal balls
review/text: My eight month old kitty, Jitterbug came to us eating Science Diet and everything was fine.  I slowly switched him over to Purina indoor, which I've always fed my cats and had no problems with.  Well I started noticing Jitterbug was leaving small little balls of poo all over the house!  Instead of taking him to the vet and paying a lot of money on tests I thought I'd try this expensive food first and what do you know, no more poop balls!  It's too bad it's so pricey, but if I don't have to deal with feces outside the litter box, I'll pay top dollar.  My cat has been on this formula for a month now and I'm very pleased with the results.

review/text: Our cat was a stray that showed up at a friend's farm.  He was in very bad shape...very skinny, lethargic, and his fur was very wiry!  We got him on the mend with a visit to the vet and some antibiotics.  But it wasn't until we started feeding him Science Diet that we noticed the change in his fur.  It made such a vast difference!  He has the softest fur I have ever felt on a cat!  The Science Diet seems to help with the hairballs, too.  It is a bit expensive, but it's worth every penny to me.

review/summary: Helps my cat's teeth
review/text: I'm not thrilled about the fillers and ground meal stuff in it as a food.  I try to look for better ingredients.  However, my vet said my cats had some tartar and sore gums.  I started mixing this stuff in with their regular food, and now (2 years later) my oldest is 4 with healthy teeth and gums.  I saw improvement in just a month or so.  Now looking at several annual visits in a row with good dental health and no tooth brushing.  Kitties seem to like it.  Healthy weight cats with dry food to graze on all they want.  I order from petfooddirect though.  When you consider the shipping costs, it's usually a little cheaper there unless amazon has it for free shipping.

review/summary: Great product, but trust your vet not the hype
review/text: I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.

review/summary: Sickening filler ingredients, high price
review/text: I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to "see the light" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do.

review/summary: Science Diet = terrible for cats, it's addictive
review/text: My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry.  Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because "it's good for the cats and they love it". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to "fatten her up" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.

So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: Just started using this so will update more later, I have an older cat 15 years old, everything she ate she would throw up she pretty much grew up on Iam's Weight Control cat food due to a previous urinary tract infection,and a weight problem (vet recommended) she weighed in at 17 lbs her heaviest the Iams never helped for years for weight control.Later in life she started losing the weight got down to a perfect weight then really started to lose to much then the last bag of Iams I bought her she refused to eat but a couple of kibbles a day, she was starving herself to death because even then she was throwing up,(she went down to 7lbs) I bought the Science Diet Sensitive stomach she is finally eating again, not throwing up so the food is A-OK with me and will spend the price for it, but like I said just starting using it will update on how she does more in to eating the food. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is the price and since I ordered this food online maybe finding the product in the stores around here I live very rural so getting to a store is a chore in itself at times.

review/summary: Nothing else works
review/text: I understand all the complaints about Science Diet. Believe me I avoided this food for quite awhile based on that information. I'm not thrilled about the filler, would prefer a food with no by-products, and yes in general think it is over priced. But my cat was throwing up everything else. And I do mean EVERYTHING else. I have tried so many top of the line foods for him and every single one he threw up. I took him to the vet, had all the xrays done, all the blood work done, put him on antibotics just in case... nothing. He is a perfectly healthy cat except that he was throwing up food 2 to 3 times a week. I talked to my mom who had 2 Siamese cats that lived into thier late teens and she said she fed them Science Diet. In fact, one of them had urninary tract problems and the SD was the only food that stopped his problems. So yes, I understand everything everyone is saying about why SD is so horrible... yet I can't argue with the results. I fed my cat this and it's been 3 weeks with no vomiting. My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results. And even if there were risks it's worth it not to have my poor kitty completely emptying his stomach 2-3 times a week from food that is making him sick. If your cat keeps throwing up, you've had the vet check him and there is nothing wrong and no other food is working... try this food. It really did work for my cat.

review/summary: My cat loves this cat food
review/text: My cat loves this cat food so much that we feed it to her as treats. She has a tendency to get underweight so we feed it to her pretty much on demand (which is frequently). I'd recomend it for fussy cats with tooth tartar problems (the chucks are larger than normal cat food and presumably help to clean their teeth when they crunch it). I usually buy the larger size for economy's sake, but this would be a better size to try out on your cat.

review/text: I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.

review/summary: Obese/overweight cat? Do your research!
review/text: This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.

review/text: My cats have been on Hill's Science Diet since they came home as kittens. This food is great and keeps them very healthy, it's what the vet has always recommended and I've stuck with for my cats. I get the big bag because it's easier to store it in a large air-tight container near their food and not have to worry about buying food every other week or so. So glad to see this on Amazon Prime now, I used to have to go out of my way to speciality pet stores just to get it as places like PetCo out here don't always carry it.

review/summary: Works Great With My Cat
review/text: I've had several cats, most of which didn't have much of a hairball problem.  However, the cat I have now, has hocked up some epic hairballs. She's the best cat I've ever had, except for this one nasty problem.<br /><br />So, I bought a small bag of this hairball control from my vet, tried it, and it does seem to have had an effect on my cat's massive hairball problem.  In fact, after about a month of mixing this with her other food, I've noticed that she's only thrown up once or twice, and that's certainly not as much as she did before.<br /><br />I found this bag on Amazon for quite a bit less than what my vet charged, so I'll continue to order it here. Based on what I've observed with my cat so far, I would highly recommend this for those of you who have cats with the same problem.

He absolutely loves it and I won't be changing brands or food anytime soon. It seems to be a very high quality dry cat food and it's definitely one that my cat loves. The big bag of food is great especially if you have large Rubbermaid (etc) containers to store it in so it doesn't get stale. I'm very happy with this food and I'm very glad the shelter (and my vet) ended up recommending it. My cat is happy and I'm happy knowing he is being fed appropriately with high quality food that is helping him stay healthy.

review/summary: Thank God I found this food!
review/text: We have 2 cats, one of which started having stomach issues about a month after she traveled eight hours and moved into our house. We thought it might be the stress of the drive, the change to a new habitat and a new cat friend. She was throwing up frequently and also having issues on the other end - I won't get into the gross details. A trip to the vet got her some antibiotics that helped for a short time, but she was back to being miserable, and obviously uncomfortable with using her litter box, not two weeks after seeing the vet. Since we found this food and transitioned her on to it, she hasn't thrown up. Her other issues have cleared up too and she is feeling healthy and happy again. So I'll say it again: thank goodness for this food!!!
