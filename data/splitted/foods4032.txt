review/summary: Good value, time saver
review/text: My wife is a lifelong weightwatcher. She has been at her ideal weight for some time now, but she still calculates Weightwatcher 'points' for all of the food she eats. Popcorn is her snack of choice, and she loves Jolly Time single serving mini-bags. These are easy to add up into her total amount of points for the day because the points (just 1 per bag) are marked right on the box. Buying by the case of 60 bags from Amazon is an easy and economical way to have plenty on hand. The case we received had 15 months until the expiration date....plenty of time to eat it all and go back for more.<br /><br />OK, late 2011 and Weight Watchers changed their 'points' system. This popcorn is no longer rated at 1 point. Same great popcorn, different rating (3 - I think)...still the best deal going

review/summary: 60 bags of tasty popcorn for $23.82 hand delivered to your front door!
review/text: I love this popcorn! Not just because it is 100 calories, it just really good microwave popcorn. It doesn't have too much of that fake butter flavor or anything. I haven't even had to salt it. Maybe it is the small bag but it cooks perfectly and never burns. I am a junk food junkie and a late night snacker and I can eat a bag of this right before I go to sleep and I don't feel guilty knowing it is only 100 calories. And 60 bags for under $24 delivered to my front door?? How can you beat that?

review/summary: Weight Watchers Delight
review/text: I LOVE popcorn.<br />I recently joined weight watchers and they stress that NO food is forbidden, you just have to keep within a controlled portion. Jolly Time posts the WW Points PLus value on the box so I don't have to count, caluclate or divide. Just pop and enjoy. 3 points is a good value and fills me up so I don't want to snack all day.<br />AND getting it from Amazon with free super saver shipping was convenient and cost-efective.<br />Hooray for Jolly Time!

review/summary: Best snack food ever!
review/text: Sometimes you just get in a salty snacky mood and this is the PERFECT snack. I've gotten in the habit of snacking on these in the afternoon and just stopping with the normal snacking (a bag of cheetohs here, a bag of candy there) I've lost 15 pounds in two months. This baggie is the perfect size that you can munch on it for awhile, and filling enough that you can feel satisfied after eating it. Love these. Of the 100 calorie popcorn bags, I think this tastes best. The others tend to be too salty and not have that slight butter grease on it, this satisfies the grease plenty well.

review/summary: Bad batch
review/text: Have been eating this popcorn for years.  However, the last batch I received from Amazon was really strange. Most of the 60 bags had no flavoring at all and had to be thrown out.  I did contact Jolly Time and, at their request, mailed some defective bags back to them. They did seem concerned, but I never heard anything further from them. I was reluctant to order Jolly Time again and have since tried Quinn's.<br />It's more expensive but worth it.

review/summary: Pretty good and not horribly salty
review/text: I got this because the generic popcorn I was buying was so salty it was disgusting and I wanted to try something name brand that might not be so bad.  I refuse to pay $3.50 for a box of 3 of Paul Newman No Salt.  I paid $4.49 for this today at the grocery store.<br /><br />There is a lot in the bag and it was pretty good.  And the best part is that it was not loaded with sodium.<br /><br />The only problem I found was that it burned.  I used the Popcorn setting on my microwave and it still had about 15 seconds left.  This is an easy fix though and I've yet to find a microwave popcorn that doesn't get a little burned.<br /><br />I'll get this on subscribe and save when I use up what I have.

These are perfect if you are dieting.  The flavor is really good too.  I keep a few bags stashed in my drawer at work in case of emergency. :) This was a super deal, I bought the ones that came 10x to a box, so the whole case had 60 bags!  The expiration date was one year out , so plenty of time to eat these before they expire.

review/summary: Tastes "Normal" !!
review/text: First off... there are a lot of popcorn. You get 60 bags of microwave popcorn, but the good part is -- They are delicious!!!<br /><br />The bags are a bit smaller than a regular bags we used to get from the groceries store. In my opinion, it's a perfect size. Not too big, and just small enough to fill that popcorn craving while watching a TV show, or a movie.<br /><br />They're buttery, but not greasy. Just enough butter to make it taste normal. It doesn't taste anywhere near "healthy".<br /><br />Believe me, I hate healthy food and I know what they're supposed to taste like. I recently had to change my diet to the "healthy" stuff, but these Jolly popcorn didn't disappoint me.<br /><br />If you love popcorn, and need to do the healthy stuff... this is highly recommended!

review/text: I love popcorn with a buttery flavor, but I don't like the unhealthy levels of fat in the best tasting microwave popcorn. So, I tried low fat popcorn from Jolly Time, Orville Redenbacher, Act II, Smart Balance and a store brand. Jolly Time Healthy Pop Butter is my favorite. It's low in fat (each mini bag is only one Weight Watchers point) but high in taste.

review/summary: Great product, but it is 3 WW PointsPlus points per bag (not 1)
review/text: Amazon needs to upload a new picture of the box.  What you'll get is a box showing clearly that this is THREE WW PointsPlus points (not ONE).  It is likely that the 1 point references the earlier WW point tracking system.  3 points is not outrageous for a decent popcorn like this, but if you were hoping for a 1-point wonder snack, this isn't it.  It actually tastes pretty good, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it "butter flavor" as it could stand to use a bit more flavor, especially considering it is 3 points, not 1.  But I have to say it is better than a lot of the lower calorie micro-popcorn out there, it satisfies the "popcorn" / "crunchy" itch just fine.  And, you don't get in trouble like you do with the full bags... so just be clear on what you're getting here.  I would order it again, I just won't be eating them as often as I originally expected given the higher points values.

In reality - and as is stated on the boxes shipped, they are 3 WW Points Plus - Big Difference!! 3X more! Probably would have passed on them if I knew they would be 3 pts vs. 1 pt.

Well, anyway, you have very nice people working for you and we all gave it the good old college try.  But I am scared to order it again.

review/summary: This is an exceptional bouillon maker that is healthy for you to use!
review/text: We use this bouillon to add to our meals for multiple reasons.  Whether it is chicken of beef flavored it adds flavor to your meal without adding fat and provides an ideal bouillon to use to make gravy with or to use as a basting sauce to roast or broil your meat in.  You are buying all the flavor and you add your own water to make it as concentrated as you would like.  You can dissolve the bouillon powder in hot water and pour it into your food to cook it or simply stir it in without any water at all. You can even add it to vegetables to get a beef or chicken flavor added to them.<br /><br />This is great tasting, fast to make, and it is made by Hormel.  It contains only 2 carbs, 1 sugar and 1 protein per serving.  But here is the best part, it is:<br /><br />* Gluten free<br />* Sodium Free<br />* MSG Free<br /><br />If you are on a low salt and low fat diet then this is the ideal product for you. We use it all the time and it tastes good and we like the benefits that it brings to our meals as far as added flavor without some of the negative factors that you can get with other brands.  It lets you use less oil and butter while cooking and still make a tasty meal.  We like this product and we believe you will to.

We scrambled the powdered whole eggs in a separate pan from the scrambled regular eggs.  Much to my surprise, no one noticed any difference!  We have since used them in baking (wow! what convenience!) with the same results.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!!! Good to put into your pantry if you run out of eggs; good to put in storage for emergencies.  I find it a little pricey but am very pleased to pay the price for a superior product.

If you like the taste of tangerine and oranges then this is a good tea to try..its light, not an overwhelming taste, but enough to soothe the senses and please the palate.....definitely worth trying...you wont regret it!!

review/summary: Ok but most cans dented
review/text: Obviously this company is off-loading its dented cans via internet shoppers.  Out of twelve cans I received, only one was in pristine condition.  Three of them were severely dented to the point that I would never have bought them if I had been at my local grocery store. I don't think the seals have been compromised but it is borderline.  The other eight cans all have small dents and scuffs as if they had been dropped at some point- cosmetic damage only.  I am happy to have the product as my local grocery stores are having trouble getting canned pumpkin and I am craving some pumpkin pie, but I think Osbo should disclose the fact that it is selling dinged cans and not send the really bad ones at all.  I will avoid this company in the future because of this lack of disclosure.

review/summary: Smooth and Delish
review/text: First I want to say that it's absolutely horrible that Libby is selling dented cans through Amazon.  That is just shameful, and I'm assuming this results from the fact that Libby was purchased by Nestle, a company with a less than stellar reputation.<br /><br />In any case, what I wanted to comment on was the actual pumpkin part of the experience.  And here I have no complaints.  The ONLY ingredient listed is 'Pumpkin'.  And for those of you who have nut allergies like me, you should know that there are NO warning notes on the can.  (One should always check though because different cans could come from different factories.)  But on the cans I have there is no mention that there 'might' be nuts.<br /><br />In consistency, I've always found the puree to be flawless.  No lumps or dark spots.  To all appearances a wholesome product which is high in Vitamins C and A.<br /><br />Good for pies and muffins.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/pie maker

The pumpkin is nice and smooth and makes a good pie with no bitter taste. But doesn't anyone use fresh pumpkin any more? Fresh pie pumpkins are even harder to find than canned pumpkin off-season. Why? I thought pumpkin was a food. Now it's just a novelty, I guess. Too bad, pumpkins are very healthful.

review/text: *****<br />Numi Tea's Morning Rise Breakfast Blend Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic Keemun black tea, fair trade certified organic Darjeeling black tea, fair trade certified organic Ceylon black tea, anfair trade certified organic Assam black tea. A powerful black tea blend indeed! There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Numi perfects the classic breakfast tea with this organic black tea blend, Morning Rise. Four of the most extraordinary black teas compose this hearty, complex, and exciting morning cup. Ceylon, gardened in the small and exotic country of Sri Lanka, bestows its strong yet smooth profile, while Indian grown Assam imparts a malty and robust depth. Keemun, from China, offers deep burgundy notes that complement the natural floral finish and fruity Muscatel of Darjeeling, cultivated on the mountain peaks of India. This rich, bold black tea blend has an unrivaled smoothness and a magnificent aroma resembling dawn's early warmth. Let the morning greet you through the radiant daybreak of Numi's superior Breakfast Blend."<br /><br />It tastes strong and and is perfect for people who want a black tea that is not flowery or herbal-y but tasty, complex, and superb high-quality in the morning.<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love black tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br />*****

review/summary: A smooth subtle blend!
review/text: Numi has created a breakfast blend with four of the most popular black teas--Keemun, Assam, Ceylon and Darjeeling. The aroma is a fine grassy floral tea blend. The leading flavor is Keemun, a malty, slightly smoky flavor. This is a smooth subtle cup of tea, without some of the more characteristic robustness of most Breakfast blends.  However, it is still a very stimulating blend--fairly high in caffeine I would guess from its effect!  Unfortunately, Numi does not list caffeine count on the box.<br /><br />Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. The boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees, reduce landfill by 131,200, and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions. Numi uses only 100% natural ingredients without added oils or "natural flavorings".

It is the perfect taste to me, and no matter now long it seeps (if I forget to take the bag out) it doesn't develop that bitter taste.  It stands up well to milk or half and half, and is a lovely, well-rounded flavor.  I've even been able to use the teabag again for a second (albeit weaker) cup.  It IS more expensive, but I find that it is very much worth it.  Perfect anytime, but a cup of Numi is really my favorite treat in the winter or after a cold rain.

The pomegranate is not as flavorful as some of the others, its a little weak tasting to my family and I. Its not bad, but if you closed your eyes, you'd never guess what this flavor was. My daughter said it tastes "pink" and that about describes it. I recommend the orange mango, the blackberry, for a little more flavor.

review/summary: The best flavor of all the Sparkling ICE flavors
review/text: The Sparkling ICE brand is one of my favorite drink brands ever. I always thought I was craving sugar when I would reach for a soda instead of water (which wasn't often but often enough to make me hate myself for craving something so inherently unhealthy) but after realizing that it was the carbonation I was after, I quickly changed to these calorie free (and carb free, gluten free, and caffeine free) drinks instead. They are seriously so GOOD.<br /><br />And this pomegranate flavor is by far my favorite. Many of the others are so strongly flavored (the pineapple one in particular) that you can't drink it with every type of meal (ie seafood, pasta, etc) which was annoying. This one though, I found I could. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did seeing as how I'm not a huge fan of pomegranate but if I had to chose one drink that I had to drink for the rest of my life without ever having anything else, this would be a very close second behind water. It's THAT good.<br /><br />The only thing I would note is that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda doesn't bother me at all but my husband can instantly tell the difference and ends up with a stomach ache any time he consumes it so unfortunately these can't help me to get him off his soda kick. So if you are also sensitive to Splenda, this isn't the product for you.

review/text: Although labeled as 'naturally flavored sparkling mountain spring water', this product lists no fewer than 17 other ingredients beside water. Some of those ingredients seem decidedly suspect, and, at the very least, totally unnecessary: food dyes Red #40 and Blue #1.  Various groups and agencies here and abroad have expressed concern about risky side effects from using these dyes in food.  In any event, nothing good can come from them. The list of ingredients also includes two different gums, sucralose, and potassium benzoate, also questioned by consumer groups. I fail to understand why a product being touted as a healthy drink can contain so many weird ingredients.  I hope the company behind "Ice" will respond with an explanation here.  In any event, I won't be ordering "Ice" again unless it is entirely reformulated to remove the useless items.

review/summary: Bineshii Wild Rice is Outstanding
review/text: I've been eating this wild rice for years. I order it directly from the native American community that hand harvests and dries the wild rice. Now it's much more convenient to order from Amazon. I first bought the rice because my grandmother could no longer send me the two or three pounds of native wild rice she gave me each year for holiday meals...so I ordered a pound of Bineshii wild rice.<br /><br />What a surprise! This natural grown wild rice is far superior to the varieties grown on gigantic agribusiness farms in California. It is one of the very best Native American harvested products I've ever tasted. It cooks much more quickly and reliably than agribusiness wild rice, and the taste and texture is very nutty and so delicious. Bineshii wild rice does cost more than mass produced rice, but this is the real thing, and the real thing tastes so much better. My family is spoiled now, they notice if the wild rice isn't Bineshii, and complain if I put anything else on the table! Try a pound, you won't be disappointed.

review/text: This was shipped to me very fast.  The wild rice is very good quality , far superior to any cultivated wild rice normally found in markets.  Cooks very fast . Instructions said 17-22 minutes , I liked it cooked for 10 minutes at the most.  Slight smokey flavor , nice firm texture  .

review/summary: Another nice smoked salt from Artisan Salt Co.
review/text: This is another nice selection from the Artisan Salt Co., of which I've grown to trust a great deal, as the quality of their products is quite good.  The Yakima Applewood Smoked Sea Salt has a wonderful, very natural, pungent applewood smoke aroma.  You'll find none of that fake "liquid smoke" smell or taste, like that of many lesser quality smoked salts.  It's perfect for vegetable, chicken or fish dishes, or anytime you want something a little less pungent than hickory.  A light sprinkle is all you need to get a good smokiness to your foods without oversalting.

review/summary: What a pinch of salt!
review/text: The Romans used to pay their legions in salt, and as a result we have the word "salary". This Yakima salt is not cheap, but wouldn't amount to many soldiers' pay these days. I don't know how it might taste on MREs (meals ready to eat) but on beef, this salt is amazing.<br /><br />I first encountered it at the  Ritz-Carlton in Amelia Island in a Five Diamond restaurant called, not coincidentally Salt. They have forty-something varieties of salt which are offered. Told confidentially by my waiter that Yakima was superb on steak, I tried it. Now I have a year's supply and will get more when it runs out.<br /><br />My waiter was right. This salt is excellent on steak. No marinade or steak sauce is needed for a joyous encounter with a piece of prime beef.<br /><br />Bon appetit!

review/summary: FANTASTIC!!
review/text: This product is SO fantastic!! The smoked salt is a perfect flavor for so many foods. My entire family LOVES cooking with this salt and we have a bottle of it on the table for personal use too. It's not too salty at all, it just adds a touch of saltiness and a wonderful smokiness to any dish. It's great on meats, potatoes, with cheddar cheese, eggs... It's a healthy alternative to bacon. It is so versatile it's amazing. This purchase is also a great deal- you get 3 jars for a great price! We love it and plan to continue to purchase this product so we'll never have to be without it again.

review/summary: Instant Smoke Flavor to Anything
review/text: I first tried this salt at a Korean steakhouse and totally blew me away. They served it as a "side" to the the steak amongst other kinds of salts. It basically adds a smokey flavor to anything you add it on. I would not cook with it or use it as a substitute for salt in a recipe since only a small amount of this will add a lot of smokey flavor. I prefer this to liquid smoke anyday. Great on eggs and some fish as well!

review/summary: This is the best
review/text: I've been weight training for about 6 years and in that time have used just about every major brand of protein supplement and meal supplement - EAS (Myoplex, Whey), NitroTech, Optimum Whey, MET-Rx, Designer, GNC, etc. Labrada's V60 continues to be my favorite.<br /><br />As far as flavor, the vanilla tastes as good or better than the other protein powders I've had. The chocolate is mediocre, not quite as good as Myoplex. The banana flavor...well, you might want to pass on that one. My personal recommendation would be to get the vanilla and add a small amount of chocolate or strawberry syrup, bananas or peanut butter if the flavor becomes boring.<br /><br />It mixes easily so it can be put in a shaker cup or tossed on a bowl of cereal for breakfast.<br /><br />It's not a meal replacement, and doesn't contain additional vitamins and minerals like Myoplex or ProPlete, so I wouldn't recommend it as a complete meal replacement - at very least take a multivite with it. The plus side is that this keeps the carbs and calories relatively low for consuming 60g protein (most other brands deliver around 40g protein for the same calories/carbs).<br /><br />Now whether the body can actually use 60g of protein in one dose is still up for debate. Since this is a relatively high dose of protein (assuming you're consuming 4-6 30g scoops per day), I would strongly recommend consuming a half gallon of water each day to minimize the strain this puts on the kidneys.

review/summary: Smooth Mix
review/text: Regardless of what you have read, this product mixes smoothly in a blender or with a spoon.  I use this everyday and the only thing I can tell you is, you may need to have a spoon handy, if you use a blender, to scrape the excess powder off the sides of the blender back into the mix.  10-15 seconds you have a smooth fairly decent tasting shake.  I add fruit, and would suggest you do too.  16 oz of milk= about 30 oz of shake.  I drink one for breakfast and am not hungry all day.  Its ideal for meal replacement, or for somebody looking to build muscle.  60g protein and 310 calories.  I recommend this product for those looking to lose weight, or build muscle without consuming thousands of calories per shake.

I sometimes replace a meal with this shake.<br /><br />This by far is the best flavor.  I have tried the Strawberry and it was too strong and overpowering.  The vanilla works well.  I put it in my oatmeal, plain yogurt or as a yummy shake with fat free milk with ice.  It seriously tastes as good as McDonald's milkshakes...but of course much better for you.  I am all for that.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: My wife and I have both been using Labrada's products for the past year. We originally started with the Lean Body shakes but soon found the ProV 60 was cheaper when purchased in bulk like this. The vanilla is very versatile and we get rather creative with our shake flavors by adding fruit, chocolate or PB2. Between the two of us we have lost 120lbs and built some serious muscle. I have tried other brands but I always come back to Labrada because I get exactly what I expect and nothing that I don't want. We recommend this protein to all of our friends at the gym and my wife's personal training clients.

I use 1 scoop in a protein drink right after my workout(30grams) and another one before bed just the protein and water. The one after working out is a little more elaborate. It has a blend of 5 proteins one being casein pronounced(kay-seen)which is slowly absorbed which is great at bedtime to keep you from becoming catabolic during the night. Good price and delivered right to your door, Cant beat it!!  If your interested my post workout shake consists of...A few ice cubes and spring water,1/3 cup of raw oatmeal,banana,2 heaping tablespoons of 0 fat plain Greek yogurt (Greek is thicker and creamier)1 scoop of Labrada V60. If you want you can add a little olive oil for some EFA's. Good Luck!!

But if you like the harder, more chewy version, you might not like these.<br /><br />I read in another spot someone complaining because they are yellowish instead of clear like they seem in the picture.  They are indeed slightly yellow (very pale) and not clear. So, if you are buying them as a decoration, beware!<br /><br />The only problem I have with them is not eating the entire bag in one sitting.

review/summary: Cats LOVE this Dry Food.  Best Commercial Product List I've Found that in Reasonably Priced Commercial Pet Food. RECOMMENDED.
review/text: I have 4 cats ranging in age from 2-10 years old.  We previously fed them Iams Multi-Cat dry food which we purchased in 20lb bags at our local warehouse store.  About 4 months ago, the warehouse store discontinued stocking Iams cat food, so I went looking for another, better quality dry cat food that was reasonably priced (my preference was to make my own cat food, but the reality is that I don't have time to do so).<br /><br />I stumbled on Castor & Pollux on Amazon & decided to give the blue bag (adult feline) a try.  We've now gone through 27lbs of the adult feline dry food and like the Castor & Pollux dry food enough to make this our cat food of choice (so I have to remember to order ahead of time to not run out).  We are now trying the green bag (indoor cat), so that review will come later after we go through a bag or 2 (15lb bags).<br /><br />Since it is not listed, and I wanted to know this information before I purchased, here is a full List of ingredients straight from the back of the blue bag:<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal, Menhaden Fish Meal, Ground Whole Grain Barley, Oat Groats, Brewers Rice, Chicken Fat preserved with Mixed Tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), Salmon Meal, Dried Egg Product, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dried Potatoes, Cultured Whey, Dried Carrots, Dried Bananas, Dried Apples, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ground Flaxseed, Sodium Bisulfate, Potassium Choloride, Salt, Dried, Blueberries, Dried Papya, Choline Chloride, Taurine, DL-Methionine, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (source of Vitamin C), Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, Copper Sulfate, Niacin, Vitamin A Supplement, Calcium Pantothenate, Manganous Oxide, Thiamine Mononitrate (source of Vitamin B1), Riboflavin Supplement (source of Vitamin B2), Pyridoxine Hydroxcholoride (source of Vitamin B6), Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Vitamin K1 Supplement, Sodium Selenite, Folic Acid, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Cobalt Caronate, Yeast Culture (Saccharomyes Cerevisiae), Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophuilus Fermentation Product, Dried Aspergillus Niger Fermentation Extract, Dried Trichoderma Longbrachiatum Fermentation Extract, Dried Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Extract and Fermentation Solubles.<br /><br />My older cats (8 & 10 yrs) had a hard transition from the Iams.  We cleaned up a lot of carrot-filled cat vomit for the first 2 weeks.  The younger cats transitioned with no issues whatsoever.  We have since gone to the indoor feline and are not experiencing the daily upchucking (whether this is because they are already accustomed to the food or not, I don't know, but would assume that it plays a part).  All cats love the food.  We did find that they eat a little less of the Castor & Pollux, so maybe they are getting more quality with each bite.  Iams uses by-product and Cator & Pollux uses meal, so I assume this may be the case.<br /><br />I did research on by-product vs meal & found the following information from various websites:<br /><br />Protein, in the form of quality meat ingredients, is the most important component of a pet's diet. As animals with a carnivorous background, their digestive tract is designed to utilize primarily meat and fat. It is also the most expensive ingredient for a manufacturer to buy and the profit margin on a product is drastically affected by the amount and quality used. Ideally, the first ingredient of a food should be either a specified meat meal, or a specified fresh meat type followed by a meal.<br /><br />Meat sources in "meal" form (as long as they are from a specified type of animal, such as chicken meal, lamb meal, salmon meal etc.) are not inferior to whole, fresh meats. "Meal" consists of meat and skin, with or without the bones, but exclusive of feathers/hair, heads, feet, horns, entrails etc. and have the proper calcium/phosphorus ratio required for a balanced diet. They have had most of the moisture removed, but remember that meats in their original, "wet" form still contain up to 75% water.<br /><br />Byproducts of any type are less desirable and only acceptable if they do not make up the main source of animal protein and if the name of the species used is also defined in some manner (e.g. "chicken byproducts" or "beef byproducts" but not "meat byproducts" or "poultry byproducts"). Byproducts consist of anything but the quality cuts of meat.<br /><br />Castor & Pollux has a Pet & Soul Foundation that supports various pet organizations & charities.  Look on their website & do the daily free kibble game to donate free kibble to pet shelters.<br /><br />All in all, I think that I could probably come up with a better homemade cat food, but, given time constraints and solid know-how, I think that this Caster & Pollux dry food is a good choice.  My cats, all indoors, love the food, their fur is shiny & their skin appears to be healthy.  We do not have dander issues & all the cats seem to be feisty & healthy.<br /><br />This is a reasonably priced dry food with a good list of ingredients as compared to other commercial foods. Castor & Pollux claim that they fully & unconditionally guarantee their food, so if you order & don't like it, you can call them.<br /><br />Best of all, Amazon ships it to my doorstep.  RECOMMENDED.<br /><br />10/3/11 (EDIT): I am still feeding my cats this food & they are doing well.  I now supplement with a little wet cat food (have tried many brands/varieties & a still trying to find a "hit") daily, but the majority of their diet is this Castor & Pollux kibble.

review/summary: Fantastic pet food!
review/text: I bought this food on sale on a whim since a while ago, Amazon was selling this kind of cat food for ~$15 for 5 3-lb bags (I wish it still cost that much!). Long story short, I wasn't expected much from this pet food. I have two young cats (both ~7.6 months) who typically never ate their dry food unless I mixed wet food in with it or soaked it in Cat Milk. However, my cats LOVE the Castor & Pollux Ultramix. They happily eat it (including the little fruity bits),even in meals where I don't mix in wet food, and they've have so much fewer digestive issues. They've never had any hairballs and the size of the little bits is perfect for young animals making the transition to adult foods.

review/summary: kitties like it.... But product has been changed
review/text: I've been feeding my 3 cats this food for about a year now, started with the indoor formula.  The cats do enjoy the food and coats seem softer to the touch.  I subscribe to the auto deliveries and noticed that the food delivered in Sept is different, not just the bag but the kibble is smaller and the veggies are no longer present in the bag.  My cats no longer devour the food like they have been doing, so I'm not sure if I'll continue purchasing...  Guess I'll need to wait and see, give it a bit more time.  I'm giving the food 4 stars because of the change without any notice.
