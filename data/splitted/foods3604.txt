review/summary: Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee Coffee for Keurig
review/text: The taste of Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee Coffee for Keurig is what brings me back to it everytime. There really is a hint of butter toffee. It adds some snazz to my mornings, and it is a great buy through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program. I just wish it was made in decaf.

review/summary: Nah, not for me
review/text: Well, I had hoped to enjoy this coffee, but darn...the flavor seems odd, slightly burned and bitter, not smooth in the slightest. Of the eight different flavored coffees that I've tried since buying my Breville Keurig coffeemaker, this one is the least successful for me. Adding cream and sugar doesn't seem to help either, as it emphasizes the unpleasant aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm getting smarter and buying samples of various coffees before I saddle myself with a large quantity of a product that doesn't work for me. I just wish I'd done it sooner.

review/summary: Truly excellent coffee!  One of the better K-cup brands/flavors!
review/text: Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee is one of the better tasting K-cup offerings. The coffee tastes very smooth, with just the right amount of flavoring. More importantly, the butter toffee flavoring is not overpowering, and does taste as it should (accurate notes). This is a quality, well balanced coffee.

review/summary: Best coffee for Keurig, great flavor and smell.
review/text: I purchased this originally in a small quantity for my continuing search as to what is available for the Keurig.  I had read a review that was very supportive of this flavor--had to try it myself.. It is very good, in fact I drink a couple of cups each day and buy it in the convenient Amazon 50 packs--much cheaper way to buy.  I brew it next to my basement office and the whole floor smells good, a free air freshener. Try it!

I read one review that stated they felt it was bitter....it is not bitter at all & I bet that person enjoys a milder coffee. I would say this is worth a try if you enjoy flavors verses a plain coffee.

review/text: I got this flavor in a sampler pack of 4 flavors. It is one of the tastiest new flavors I've found in quite a while. It, along with the Swiss Chocolate Almond flavor from Gloria Jean's, go to the top of my flavored coffee list. The chocolate flavor doesn't overpower the coffee, and vice versa. I have all my coffee with Coffeemate Liquid French Vanilla - Sugar Free only. Thanks Gloria Jean's for adding to my coffee variety!

review/summary: coffee flavor too weak for my taste, but I fixed that!
review/text: The flavor of this coffee is nice, but it's not quite strong enough for my taste.  I have a mini Keurig machine, the kind that makes one cup at a time.  If I get a little too much water in the tank, the coffee is weak. If I get the water even with the fill line, it's still not quite "coffee" enough for me.  The butter toffee flavor is delicious, though. If you like coffee on the light side, you'll like this coffee.  If you like a medium to bold coffee flavor, skip this one.  I'll finish my box, but I won't be buying again.<br /><br />EDIT:  I'm coming back to edit this review 6 months later, because I've had to eat my words.  I HAVE bought more of this coffee, and I can't in good conscience leave this review as is.<br /><br />After my first box, I tried other K Cups, & what I found was--they were all either too weak or too blech tasting.  So what I've done is go back to the toffee flavor, & in every cup I add one of those instant coffee sticks you can buy at the grocery store in the coffee aisle (20 per box for around $3.50). It adds just the right amount of extra coffee boldness that I like. I add the Hazelnut instant coffee to this flavor, and it's wonderful.<br /><br />I love that Amazon has now added a 50 cup box, frustration free packaging, for $22.  What a deal.

review/text: I have had my Keurig for many years and we have tried almost every K-cup made.  This seems to be the biggest hit in the house and I recently went on vacation to Florida and bought some there for my family and we could not keep it in stock at the house!  From my 21 year old niece, to my 84 year old grandparents, they all loved it as well. They were all Hazelnut people, as I am as well, but this has turned in to our new fave! Just yummy, I wish it was made in decaf so I could drink more of it per day without shaking :)

review/summary: My Fianc&eacute;e LOVES Her Butter Toffee!!!
review/text: I got the Keurig B60 coffee maker for my girlfriend (now my fianc&eacute;e) for Christmas last year. She was so excited when she realized that she would have the ease of making a cup of coffee whenever she wanted. I don't drink coffee but I like to vicariously live through her...or at least smell the freshly brewed cup.<br /><br />I first got her the Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for her to try. She liked the flavor and definitely enjoyed the Donut Shop coffee but I felt she might be getting a little tired of the Donut Shop coffee because I'd gotten her the amazon.com 50 pk. I started looking around on amazon.com again to find "the perfect" K-Cup for her. I stumbled onto Gloria Jean's Coffees, Butter Toffee K-Cup. I read the reviews and thought I'd take a chance, so I ordered it. I knew I had done something right when she took a sip from her first cup of the Butter Toffee! Her eyes got big and and exclaimed loudly..."YUMMY!!!".<br /><br />It's been about 2 1/2 months now and the Butter Toffee is still the only K-Cup that sits next to our Keurig! She goes through the 48 pk in about 3 weeks! She's stated that the Butter Toffee doesn't even need creamer because the flavor is already so good. If you're looking to impress someone with a special K-Cup, then this is the one for you! You won't be sorry! Just be ready for a loud "YUMMY" within the first 5 minutes of receiving this item :D

I was so anxious to try butter toffee just to be somewhat disappointed that the coffee tastes burnt. There is definitely a great smell to it, but the actual taste of it is different than the smell. I have had my co-worker tell me the same of this brand of coffee.

This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor.

review/text: They look really nice and were very cute.  My dog just turned 15 so I gave these out to friends with dogs for her birthday.  My dog ate hers, but I don't think she loved the taste.  However, I bought them more for the fun of it than for a tasty treat and they served that purpose well.

review/summary: This is how coffee is supposed to taste!
review/text: I drank this coffee in Italy 2 years ago when we rented a house there - the locals recommended it - and I am so excited to find out it is available on Amazon.  It has a very nice body without the strong aftertaste - the best way to describe the taste is - full bodied and smooth.  Love, love, love it!  Definitely an improvement over any north American roasted coffee, which tends to have too much bitterness - sign of over-roasting.

review/summary: Excellent Price for fresh Candy Corn!
review/text: When ordering candy, there is always the worry of getting old & stale stuff. Well, I ordered mine from Candy Crate, and I got some excellently fresh candy corn! Well packaged, nice and fresh!<br /><br />The candy corn was inside a nice bag that will keep the freshness (which was tied on the top) and then inside of a shopping bag style bag with handles that were also tied. Then inside a box with packing paper to prevent accidental tears on the trip. Bulk packaging, but well worth it!<br /><br />This is the traditional candy corn I was looking for! Orange center, white pointy end, and yellow on the wide end. Brightly colored and tastes great! If you are looking for candy corn, this is a sweet deal!

review/summary: NOT BRACHS BRAND
review/text: I ordered these because they were described online as Brachs brand and I was specifically looking for Brachs.  These are definitely not Brachs candy corn.  They look and more importantly, taste totally different.  They do not look like this display picture, and they have a sweeter, waxy, artificial taste.  I contacted the seller and said that I wanted to exchange them for Brachs and he told me that these were Brachs.  I have to absolutely disagree with him.  It sounds silly, but I know my candy corn and these are definitely not Brachs brand.

review/text: Candy Corn is the ultimate Halloween candy.  It's almost a shame I haven't actually had any in years.  Oh but the memories- the memories of Halloween night, trick or treating around town and having small bags of candy corn thrown in my bag.  Always the first thing I'd eat when I got home and emptied my bag all over the floor.  Towards the end of my candy corn eating days however, I noticed that the taste had been exchanged for a more sugar-only catastrophe.  Hopefully the company that produces these candies has rebounded with a mighty fine tasting product for the Halloween kids this year who certainly deserve the wonderful type that I grew up with.

review/summary: This is THE very best brittle I have EVER eatten in my 55 years of life.
review/text: I have never been a peanut brittle fan but have had occasions to eat it a lot over my 55 year life...I have eaten a lot of dry, rock hard brittles that taste like sugar with old stale peanuts.<br /><br />This is the exact opposite...what a pleasant surprise! Easy to bite and chew with perfect crunch (but you won't break your teeth). Super buttery (real butter) , big fresh peanuts, authentic vanilla flavor...  I love all the natural ingredients in it...no weird chemicals or artificial flavorings.  Its just so amazing....I could eat the whole box in a sitting.  I LOVE this stuff...and I will never eat any other kind of peanut brittle again as long as i live.<br /><br />My southern raised mom got this for Christmas...and I ate it all while she went away on vacation for the winter...I am buying 2 boxes now...one to replace her box, and one for me.  I wish it was sold close to my home so I could eat it all the time.  Its a very VERY special gourmet treat.

review/summary: Orange and dark chocolate...yum...
review/text: One of my favorite flavor combinations is orange and dark chocolate. I saw these on my grocery store shelf one day & decided to give them a try.  I wasn't totally sure of what I was getting. The word 'biscuit' confused me, but I'd heard that the British use that word for cookie.  The biscuit is more of a soft cookie about 1/4" thick; it's topped with a stiff orange jelly & iced with a thin layer of dark chocolate icing. One of these cookies will satisfy my craving. I tried the raspberry flavor, but prefer the orange.<br /><br />Serving Size: 2<br />Servings per 5.29 oz Container: 6<br />Calories: 100<br />Total Fat: 3 g<br />~Saturated Fat: 1.5g<br />~Trans Fat: 0<br />Cholesterol: 10mg<br />Sodium: 35mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 17 g<br />Dietary Fiber: 0<br />Sugars: 14g<br />Protein: &lt;1g<br /><br />Ingredients listed on product page under Important Information<br />Made in Belgium

review/summary: Great little dessert cookie, or "chocolate and orange, together at last"
review/text: My late father's favorite flavor combination was orange and chocolate. His confection of choice was candied orange peel covered in dark chocolate. When he passed away in his 80's we found a small stash of chocolate-covered orange jellies in the cupboard--his treat. He'd have LOVED this cookies. They are soft sponge biscuits with a layer of stiff orange jelly and a brittle dark chocolate topping. The combination is delectable--the soft biscuit, orangey jelly and the crackle of the bitter chocolate on top. A few of these make a great dessert with a cup of espresso. They come in raspberry flavor as well, which I tried and it's also absolutely terrific. So keep a tube of these on hand and if required to produce a dessert or afternoon refreshment for a sudden visitor, make a cup of coffee and put a few of these on a nice paper doily. Done.

review/summary: I've loved them since i was a child
review/text: I've been eating these Belgian cookies since i was a child growing up in Belgium.  They're a very old cookie called Couques de Bastogne (Bastogne cookies, from the town where the Battle of the Bulge took place). They were first marketed in the U.S. under that name but since that didn't mean  much to Americans the name's been changed several times over the 20 or so years I've seen them around. My local grocery store (I live in the Rockies) was carrying them, then Nabisco took over the LU brand and quit carrying the Bastogne here.  I just bought several boxes in NYC at a deli next to Time Square and really wanted more.  So happy to have found them on Amazon.<br /><br />They're a bit sweet, that's true, and that is a bit unusual for a European cookie but they make the best dunking cookie: cold milk, coffee of hot chocolate. They're similar to the the Lotus cinnamon cookie also made in Belgium that Delta serves on its flights. sorry the name escapes me.  I prefer the texture of the Cinnamon Sugar Spice; it's lighter.

review/text: Great taste and go well with coffee.  They are wrapped into two packs inside the box, which is useful for snacks for the kids.  It is also helpful because once you open a pack, they get a bit stale couple days later.

review/summary: Great cookies!
review/text: I am always looking for something to send to my sons (one is in college the other in the military). I sent these cookies along with some other LUs to my college son. He called me almost immediately when he received them (and suprisingly it wasn't for money, lol) to thank me. He told me that all his roomates devoured several boxes within just a few minutes. So, these cookies passed the college frat test. Combining it with Amazon Prime shipping and it's all good. Kudos!

review/summary: Ah, Back In France Again!
review/text: Seems France knows what to do with butter (beurre).  If you've ever sampled the delicious butter made in the north, in Brittany and Normandy, you know what I'm saying.  The French are masters of using butter in cooking.  So, in turn, the French know butter cookies.  These are French butter cookies, and it's quite a treat finding them on Amazon. Vive Le Petit Beurre!

review/summary: Buy Them Off the Shelf
review/text: For years, the only Lu's I could find at my local market were the USA Lu's, which aren't as good as the Belgium biscuits.  So, I was happy to find them at Amazon this past July, 2012 and bought the case of six boxes.  Unfortunately, they didn't taste fresh and had an expiration date of Dec. 2012; that explained the stale taste, but I chose not to return them.  Instead, I nuke two in the microwave for 5 or 6 seconds and it sort of revives the flavor.<br /><br />Well, last week, Sept. 14, 2012, I found the Belgium Lu at my local supermarket and bought a single box.  That box expires Dec. 2013, over a year from now, and the cookies definitely taste better.  Moral of the story: Buy them where you can read the Expiration date.  I surmise that having a year or two shelf life should be about right.

review/summary: PIMS ORANGE
review/text: This is the second (and last) time in a few years that I buy Pim's Orange from Amazon. Like the first time, I was disappointed, not because of the cookie itself, which is normally delicious--as a French person, I am very familiar with PIM'S cookies and know what they should taste and look like--, but because of the improper manner in which the packages are stored and handled along the way (I cannot figure out at which end). Obviously, the packages go from cold to hot temperatures (or vice versa), possibly multiple times, which is the worst thing that can happen to cookies incorporating chocolate and filling: this alters their appearance and consistency--chocolate surface becomes discolored and collapses due to melting before regaining some firmness, and the cookie part and filling become too soft. The taste is not affected too badly, but you cannot serve them to guests, because of the cookies' miserable appearence.  In order to save them anyway for my own consumption, I wrap the individual packs in a bath towel and store them in the vegetable compartment of my refrigerator. That helps regain some firmness in the cookies, but of course the chocolate surface remains discolored. So my advice is:  buy individual packs at your grocery store if they carry PIM'S, because the cookies are normally delicious, but do not buy them from Amazon.  It's too bad that Amazon has done nothing so far to correct this storage problem. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, to my satisfaction 99 p.100 of the time, including LU "Petit Beurre" cookies (these are rarely available in US grocery stores). Since they include no chocolate or filling, the shipments are usually in perfect condition.  I give PIM,S Orange three stars because the product is excellent under normal conditions, and the problem is not caused by the manufacturer.

review/summary: Simply rated:  parfait.
review/text: My French teacher (native French) introduced these cookies to me. I tried to bake these at home following a reliable recipe but it just didn't taste/feel the same. As a healthy eater, I usually don't consume much butter. But the "petit beurre" biscuits are now my favorite companion for tea or coffee. They are not heavy or too sweet--just perfect in its texture, taste, and design. I just received a box of 6 just 2 days after ordering (go Amazon prime!) and couldn't help but enjoy two biscuits right away--yum! Probably going to order more once these are gone.

review/summary: WONDERFUL Shortbread like homemade!
review/text: I'm always on the hunt for the best Scottish Shortbread and after several other brands, I found Lu's to the the BEST for any mass made shortbread cookies out there.  Visitors always comment how good they are and often switch to this brand after trying it just once.  Scottish Shortbread is supposed to be buttery, dense and not sweet, just a bare minimum of sweetness.<br /><br />Don't even bother with Wxxxxx's...blech!  If you like Scottish Shortbread, almost like homemade, then this is the one!  I'm so happy it's available on Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" program.

review/summary: Petit Beurre Biscuits
review/text: Lu Petit Beurre are the best biscuits of their type I have tasted and compare very favorably with the English brands of Petit Beurre. They are crisp and firm and have a great flavor without being too sweet or buttery. A superb accompaniment to a cup of tea. May this long established French company, now a division of Kraft Foods, keep up their good work making great products.

review/summary: not too sweet, just right
review/text: i personally enjoy this tea biscuit since it is not too sweet (like a cookie), and not like a cracker.  I enjoy with tea - either when I am driving to work early in the morning, or when I want a snack.  It is great to keep a package at work or in the car for a quick treat without too many calories.  It satisfies me until the next meal.

review/summary: Not really a biscuit/cookie
review/text: These "soft biscuits" are less like biscuits/cookies and more like really really dense cake. It was quite a surprise when I first tried one because I was expecting something similar to the soft cookies you buy in the grocery store. Never the less, the taste is very good with the raspberry filling being nicely complemented by the dark chocolate.<br /><br />The flavor is nice but the cookie part was too odd for me so I won't be buying this again. Still, I think there are probably a lot of people who would enjoy this product and if you like raspberry and dark chocolate you may want to give it a try.

review/text: These shortbread cookies are amazing. They are made of only 4 simple ingredients (wheat flour, butter, sugar, and salt), and they taste heavenly. If you made these cookies yourself, at home, you would use the same ingredients. There is nothing artificial added.<br /><br />Besides all of that, they are crispy, very satisfying and not too sweet. My grandchildren love them as much as I do. If you like shortbread, you will love these cookies. If you haven't tried shortbread cookies, I suggest you give these a try and start with the best, right from the Scottish Highlands.

review/text: I never bother to write reviews but I am SO SAD that Amazon doesn't carry these cookies anymore that i had to write a eulogy.  I had these on subscribe and save and was ordering about 3 cases a month.  My husband is English and we drink a lot of tea in this house and there is seriously no better tea cookie.  These cookies are pretty good dry, but dunked in a hot cup of milky tea they are total heaven.  Since Amazon isn't carrying them anymore I am going to have to figure out another way to get my fix.
