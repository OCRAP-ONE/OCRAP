review/summary: Not so good
review/text: When I was a child, my grandmother got some popcorn sent to her straight from the fields in Missouri.  It was white and SO tasty it didn't need butter or salt.  I've been on a search to find more ever since.<br /><br />This isn't it.<br /><br />The kernels are quite small but, worst of all, only about 40% of them pop.  That's a lot of "old maids" and makes this tuff pricey indeed.<br /><br />I contacted the seller with the issue; they told me to pop it at a lower microwave setting -- didn't help.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars only because what did pop was OK-tasting.<br /><br />Keep looking...

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: I ordered Snappy white popcorn, mushroom popcorn and this bag of Lady Finger popcorn all from Amazon.  So far I've reviewed the Snappy white (wonderful).  I tried this Lady Finger corn today.  I measured the oil, popcorn and Flavorcol so that my sloppy technique of eye-balling the amounts wouldn't mess it up.  It popped quickly in my Whirly-Pop popper and the kernels were a nice, appealing yellow color.  As stated in their description, these are tiny, tiny kernels that produce tiny, tiny popcorn.  They were fairly tender and tasty but a bit chewy.  They are supposed to be "hullless."  I'm not sure I agree with that but it is true that the hulls don't pop off and land in the bottom of the bowl.  The hulls stick to the kernels which is what makes them sort of chewy.  I will use these up but I probably won't buy more.  Kids may like the tiny kernels more than I did. I found them messy to eat because I kept dropping them.  My dog loved the ones I dropped!  I also had only about a dozen unpopped kernels.

review/summary: Probably the worst of the Amish popcorn types
review/text: The kernels are very small, much smaller than movie theater popcorn. There are also a lot more unpopped kernels and because the popcorn is so small, it tastes like I'm eating larger hulls because the ratio of kernel to hull is closer. This is the worst of the three Amish flavors I tried, with Baby White as the clear winner. Skip this and go straight to Baby White.

review/text: At the time I bought Santa Fe Refrito, the idea of "less than can" sized portions was new to me. I would cover 7/8 of a can with plastic wrap and a rubber band. Refrito can have a high dose of sodium so I would not over do it. Santa Fe Dry refrito can be made in any size portion, in my case directly in a microwave in a 1/2 cup food storage container. Since this purchase I have noticed the availability of similar products in the bulk foods section of Fred Meyer, with even lower sodium concentrations.

review/summary: Great Mustard based hot sauce!
review/text: This is one of our favorite sauces. rating Hottness is difficult to do because every one tastes things different. All I can say is, if original Tabasco is hot to you, then this is not for you. I feel as if this is on par with original Tabasco in heat but has a different flavor. Colon Cleaner is a mustard based sauce with a lot of flavor. It's main ingredients are Scotch Bonnet peppers and mustard. It is not so hot that you can't taste it like some other brands. It is one of our favs! If you like to change things up and have an extensive collection of hot sauce's like we do, this will be a great addition. The price of 12 seems a bit high (the highest I'v seen). I have seen it as low as 5 and averages around 7-8.

It appears to be more the result of a colon cleansing if you ask me. In any case it has an odd and slightly bitter taste. I think it's the mustard they put in it. Yuck...

review/text: Ever since finding pandan flavored ice cream at a Thai fusion cafe across from my university, I've been obsessed with trying to find pandan to make my own. I took a chance with this product and bought 6 bottles, mainly because it was so cheap. I hugely regret it. The product lists sorbitol as its primary ingredient and I would suspect that green food coloring comes in second. The flavor itself is weak and artificial and does not at all resemble the magical, toasty, vanilla-y flavor that I so desperately crave. If you're looking for even a halfway decent pandan extract, avoid this at all costs!

review/summary: No Joke- Use with Caution
review/text: I have had the same bottle of this elixir of the Gods for a couple of years now. After learning my lesson the hard way, I use it VERY sparingly as a condiment. When I first brought this bottle of thermo-nuclear liquid home, I decided to make a super-charged Buffalo Wing sauce. I proceeded to mix about a tablespoon of this in with some Frank's Red Hot (about 2 or 3 ounces)into which I dumped a dozen or so chicken wings hot out of the oil.  As I began eating the first wing, the sensation of heat was pretty intense. I was reasonably sure I had committed an error in judgement; after eating about 1/2 a dozen wings (and downing a couple of beers) I lost the ablity to see, speak or think clearly. Seriously, This is a great flavorful sauce with tons of heat.  Enjoy responsibly. Oh, and as others have mentioned, the "secondary" burn of this sauce is not to be underestimated.

review/summary: This is very hot, not for the tobasco lovers...
review/text: If you get this sauce for the first time, I would take a edge of a toothpick and dip it in the sauce, and get the smallest amount on your tounge. It will burn for a good 10 minutes. This will let you know exactly how hot this sauce is. While I would bet most people use this sauce as an additive in other foods like salsa or chili, I like to put it on burittos (the football sized ones from mexican resturants), about one drop every third bite. But if you eat it that way, be prepared to pay the price. Your mouth will burn with no relief in sight. Your sinuses will clear and your nose will run uncontrollably. Your eyes may turn red, and you might have a hard time breathing. And don't forget about that second burn, the next time you use the toilet (that is a serious warning. I was at a mexican resturant with a friend who ate dave's on his burrito. Dave's kicked in and he had to go. Everyone in the resturant could hear him howling in pain while he was in the bathroom). I only know of one other person who can eat the sauce as a sauce. Everyone else who has tried it has begged for an ambulance or help. It is that hot. And I love it.<p>One other note. If you use it as an additive, a little will crank up the heat level of most foods. If you don't think the hot salsa from the grocery store is hot, a few drops of this will make that salsa much hotter. But do yourself a favor, and make your own salsa. It is easy. I chop up two jalepenjo peppers, a onions, a can of diced tomatoes, maybe subsitute a chipolte if i want more sweetness, the juice of a lime, and a dash of dave's. Salt it and let it sit in the fridge for an hour. After an hour, drain the liquid into the blender, and add in one more can of canned tomatoes. Blend it, and then add it back to the salsa mixing it up. For something different, chop up a bit of mint for the salsa. It will give an odd taste. Your mouth will burn as you breath out, and cool as you breath in.

My husband started eating it for a late night snack and then started eating it for breakfast - and I was lucky to get a couple of bowls for myself.<br /><br />We like all the flavors, but I like the "Original" best.  I enjoy the crunchy, freshness and it's not overly sweet like many granolas are. I'd rather add a little honey than gag on super sweet cereal.<br /><br />highly recommended!

review/text: I love this product as my "cheat" snack as it isn't high in sugar, but still gives me a quick sugar fix.<br />I think it's a great blend of all things yummy.<br />The only downside is that it can be addicting and if you're watching calories, there's a serious need to apportion your serving prior to digging in.

review/text: This is my third time purchasing Udi's Original.  It remains my favorite, with a wonderful balance of healthy ingredients.  I mix it in Stoneyfield no-fat unsweetened yogurt, and have it for breakfast.  It is sweet enough that it compensates for the blank yogurt, and makes a great meal.  I especially like th banana chips, and nuts.  Nothing in it is too hard for my sensitive teeth.  I've tried Udi's other flavors, which are good, but this is by far the best.  A great value too, when you purchase 6 bags.

review/summary: this is the best way to end gophers in your yard
review/text: I have been using this trap for 30 years and it has always done the job. The trick is to know how to use the trap. You need to have two of them, each one going in the opposite direction in the tunnel. And it makes a big difference if you bait the trap before you place it in the tunnel. You want to attract the gopher to the trap, otherwise you will not be as successful.

review/summary: Works perfectly
review/text: We have had an ongoing gopher problem in our yard since we neighbor a large hillside. Our nicely landscaped yard and moist soil is a buffet for gophers.<br /><br />We have tried the following with a mediocre success rate:<br /><br />1) Ultrasonic repellants (battery or solar powered stakes) - This may keep them from creating a burrow under your yard, but it doesn't keep them from eating your grass at night. Waste of money.<br /><br />2) Castor oil pellets and spray (Sweeney's) - Seems to deter them if your grass is freshly sprayed. A hungry gopher will still find roots to eat and will still tear up your yard in the process. It also is an ongoing process to apply this stuff and doesn't make your yard smell to good. For the price and effort, not recommended.<br /><br />3) Smoke bombs (Giant Destroyer) - These work if you catch the gopher red-handed and quickly insert the smoke bomb in the active hole. Also, If you have a network of tunnels in your yard and find a main runway you may kill some gophers as well. The problem is that a gopher will instinctively 'plug up' the tunnel and return to it's burrow. However, I still keep these on hand in case the situation calls for it.<br /><br />4) Flooding - this may work in some cases you can drown the gopher or it will dig its way out and catch the end of your shovel. For a gopher invading your yard it will only slow it down and cause it to dig in other spots. Gophers design their tunnels in a way that their burrow is protected against flooding. You also make a big muddy mess in most cases.<br /><br />5) Rototiller - This is a sure way to evict gophers if you are starting from ground zero. be sure to keep a shovel handy since they will run for cover. This is good for new yards since it will break down any existing tunnel system. If you are planting sod be sure to lay chicken wire a few inches below the sod. Gophers love grass roots.<br /><br />Once you have an established landscape that is being compromised by gophers - the best thing to use is:<br /><br />6) TRAPS! -  If you dig up a gopher mound and find a tunnel, the gopher will instinctively 'plug up' the opening or push dirt out as it continues to dig up your yard. By placing this trap IN an active open tunnel you will catch the gopher as it pushes dirt out. This is the best solution I have found.<br />A few tips:<br />  a) Tie a string or wire to the trap and the other end to a stick or some sort of anchor. This way you can pull the gopher out since it will try to retreat when it's trapped.<br />  b) cover the hole with a bucket or box to block the light. Gophers are sensitive to light and it may choose to plug up the tunnel and not approach the trap.<br />  c) I have a low tolerance for dead rodents and choose to throw the trap away with the dead gopher. Considering the time and money I spend on my garden, $5 for a dead gopher is a small price to pay.<br /><br />We are currently enjoying a gopher free garden without poisons and smelly repellents. I highly recommend this or other similar wire traps.

review/summary: Works; what more do you want?
review/text: These are the traps my dad used on his hobby farm when I was growing up to keep the gopher population down that insisted on burrowing along the banks of the irrigation ditches.  My present home is a little higher than an alafalfa field on one side, with a new development on the other.  I don't get a lot of gophers, but when I saw them messing around our rock wall last year , these traps solved my problem.  This year, I saw a fresh mound where I was working in the front, trying to get the yard ready for planting a lawn, and the traps again solved the problem within an hour of setting them.  If you can see an area of active work, that seems to be the best place for setting the traps.  I use a shovel to find remove a bit of dirt from the hole, then a gloved hand to scoop away a bit more to widen the hole, then set the trap with the jaws inward.  I don't like setting the traps, but once you figure it out, it is easy enough to handle them safely.  I attached a thin cord as a precaution to the gopher being half trapped and carrrying the trap down the hole further, but no problem with that (yet).  I've caught them with it set just like I describe, as well as after placing a board over the top (safety for kids and cats).  As another reviewer suggested, if you don't know which half of the tunnel the gopher is in, set one in each doorway.  About the only downside is that the trap doesn't empty itself, but life isn't all cherries, especially for the gopher.

review/summary: Got my gopher
review/text: If you're reading this review, you've got problems...gopher problems. I did too until I bought a two pack of these traps from Amazon. Before the traps, I tried wishing them away, flooding the tunnels with water and even used the poison from Lowe's in the pointy tube container but nothing worked. The varmit was tunneling all over my yard and killing plants and grass everywhere. But after watching a video on Youtube, I decided to buy the twin pack of traps and selected a fresh area where it was working, I dug down and found the tunnel. Now the video said to use 2 traps - one on each slide of the tunnel but I just used one and together with a small amount of peanut butter...success! I got him (her) and the trap worked exactly as stated.<br />My advice is tie a line to the trap and secure it to a stake so it won't drag it off but (knock on wood) my yard is gopher free and if another one finds my yard a buffet, I'm ready! Good luck.

review/summary: Not exactly humane but low-cost and effective
review/text: After several months of trying to discourage the pocket gophers in my back yard by non-violent means, I found myself with a yard that was more dirt than lawn.  Garlic oil repellents and sulfur-based smoke bombs did nothing to slow them down.  Flooding and refilling the tunnels with the dirt they dug out may have hydrated and aerated the soil but it only made it easier for them to dig it up the next night. I decided the time had come to sacrifice my karma and take more aggressive action.<br /><br />I bought the twin-pack, intending to use them as described in all the online instructions -- probe for the main tunnel, cut out a section of the sod above the tunnel, wire the traps back-to-back and place them in the tunnel (taking care not to touch them with bare hands lest I leave dreaded human scent on the traps), stake the traps so that the gopher can't drag it down the tunnel, replace the sod and wait.  Instead, I decided to try the easy way first.  I dug the dirt plugs out of two of the gophers' exit holes, set and inserted a trap into each (bare-handed), staked them and covered each hole with one of my dog's frisbees to block out the light.  Result:  Next morning -- two traps, two dead gophers; the following night, two more gophers.<br /><br />The traps have proven quite effective and are relatively simple to use (with a little practice needed in learning to set them without injury).  I'd guess my success ratio has settled down to 40-50% -- perhaps not as effective as the recommended procedure but requiring far less effort.  A few times the gophers have managed to plug the traps with dirt without setting them off and one pulled up the stake and did drag the trap down the burrow to where I had to dig it out but, after eight days, I no longer had piles of dirt in the yard.  Four months later, I'm starting to see some new holes (but no dirt, for some reason), so it's time to start setting the traps again and I'm confident these traps will continue to do the job.<br /><br />One note for the squeamish or easily upset -- these traps are not for the faint-of-heart.  Unlike standard mouse and rat traps which dispatch their victims with a quick snap of the neck, these traps work by encircling the gopher's mid-section and essentially suffocating the critter.  In addition, the capture wires have *very* sharp ends which frequently skewer the animal in the process.  It is not uncommon to pull out a trap with a still-moving, bleeding gopher attached.  Finally, it is very difficult to remove the gopher from the trap without personal contact with the carcass, leaving you three choices -- (1) get your hands dirty, (2) wear gloves and get the gloves dirty, (3) throw out the trap with the animal.<br /><br />The bottom line is that, if you want to get rid of some gophers and are not averse to bloodshed, these do the job well.

review/summary: Sorry, didn't work for me
review/text: So here's my story. First of all, I've no particular interest in promoting any particular mole trap. I just want to let folks know what worked  (and didn't) for me.<br /><br />About five weeks ago I began to notice that I had a new mole problem in my yard. Two to four new mounds would be noticed each morning. I had a similar problem last year and a `professional' mole trapper caught one and the problem went away for several months.<br /><br />I initially bought three different brands of traps (Macabee, Talprid, and Victor)  and set them out following the manufacturers instructions. Because I have a big lawn and wanted to construct a valid `scientific' experiment I set out six of each trap in various locations throughout the lawn. Each morning I would check the Macabee and Victor traps and usually I would see that the traps had been covered by dirt. To me this showed that the holes were active. However, in all these cases the traps failed to trigger despite proof of fresh mole activity. The Talprid trap was occasionally triggered but no evidence of mole demise was found...and fresh mole activity was noted the next day.<br /><br />I then recalled the brand of trap that the mole trapper from last year had employed. A little internet search showed me that it was the Cinch brand mole trap. I purchased several Cinch traps and, after they arrived, began to incorporate them into my experiment.<br /><br />I kept using the Victor and Macabee along with the Cinch traps despite my yard looking like a miniature movie set of a battlefield with mini-craters everywhere. But...success! Two days after beginning use of the Cinch traps I caught the first of three moles. The Victor and Macabee traps continued to be buried, rarely triggered, and never caught anything.<br /><br />Three weeks later I still haven't had moles return. If they do I'll doubt I'll use anything but the Cinch traps.<br /><br />Analysis: I know some writers swear by other brands and I have no doubt that they have a reason for doing so. They didn't work me. The Cinch traps did. I've also had several other friends, neighbors, and acquaintances relay similar success stories with this particular trap.

review/text: After trying for over a week with the Victor Black Box style trap with no success, I purchased this two pack of traps.  They worked wonderfully on the first go around.  I was originally put off by this type of trap because of the extra things you need to set them (wire to tie the two traps together, and marker flags to pin them down so a half dead gopher can't run off with your trap), but with a little creativity used a wire hanger bent to accomplish what I needed without extra purchasing.  Cheaper, and for me, very effective.

review/summary: There's no school like old school...
review/text: I'd tried several other types such as the Sonic Warfare (Mole Chaser and Mole Mover) but it was old school that did the trick. I'm impressed!<br /><br />Thought that I'd use the newer technology, being a Geek and all, so I purchased a couple of the kinds of spike- like devices that emit sound and dig a hole to put it in and walk away. Sadly, after *SIX WEEKS* I still had not got rid of the little beast. I don't like to hurt creatures and avoid killing anything at all but this was just getting ridiculous. I knew that it would be a real war of attrition. The longer it went on, the more my lawn looked like a vacant yard. The holes were popping up *EVERYWHERE* and I've spent hundreds of dollars on irrigation, sod and fertilizer to get a pretty stellar looking yard here in San Diego. If you have put a lot of TLC into making your home look good then you know where I'm coming from.<br /><br />So, I took the plunge and spent another $12 or so (plus S&H) and waited for the traps to arrive. I was dubious that they would work after trying the sonic and poisons. Meanwhile, I looked at several YouTube videos on how to set these up. Amazing what you can find on there, from how to build a rocket to sharks with laser beams attached to their heads ;-)<br /><br />Anyway, putting them in proved to be a pretty simple task. Watch the videos and follow the directions. A couple of key things: make sure that you set the trap so that the critter can't dig underneath it and bypass the trap. The thing with moles is that they're lazy so if you set it so that the tips of the trap are positioned properly, then you're golden. Also, a piece of string or some other way to secure the trap to the ground is *critical* as the moles can be quick and big so they can easily drag this trap back down the tunnel. Then you're really screwed 'cause you got a pissed off mole and you've lost one your new traps. So, make sure to secure the trap with a piece of twine/string/wire and anchor it to the ground.<br /><br />I'm glad that they worked, was really getting frustrated with my yard looking ragged. Not only that, but I have a Skunk who likes to dig up the Mole holes looking for his Dinner. UGH!!! But, that's an entirely different Product Review and story. Good Hunting!<br /><br />Cheers

review/summary: Room for improvement
review/text: The traps are mostly functional but the wires that engage the trigger are too soft so they bend easily and are not of uniform length causing them to bend while setting and tripping.  I have some of the same model traps from 20 years ago that still work and were made to much higher quality standards. These will be lucky if they last one season. Cheapening the product is not a good way to sell more.

I close the hole with small stakes and pieces of dirt and then fine dirt to close completely off.  If I don't keep the light and fresh air out they will fill the traps with packed dirt. If the run is active<br />I'll catch one in a few hours.

review/summary: Simple and effective engineering--MADE IN the USA
review/text: I have had gophers in my back yard garden for 3 years now. I have tried various chemical options including pepper and dried blood and the gophers show up each year. They recently started a massive expansion campaign, and I became desperate scouring the internet for options......Then I found this trap. I read the reviews, bought it and within one hour of setting 3 traps, I had 2 gigantic dead gophers.<br /><br />This trap is simple in engineering and very effective. The key to setting the trap is to ensure the closed end of the trigger bar is in the vertical position when engaging the trap.To remove the gophers just reach between their forelegs (they usually get caught just behind the foreleg) and press down on the upper frame while holding the trap in an inverted position. A good shake usually releases the gopher.<br /><br />For the first time I am not feeling overwhelmed by these critters. It's either them or my vegetable garden so the choice is obvious.<br /><br />Highly recommend. I got two packs (4 traps).

review/summary: Worked for me the first time
review/text: After trying other methods without success, I bought these traps based on Amazon's customer reviews and the price.  I noticed new gopher mounds on Friday afternoon.  On Sunday morning I dug a 12" x 12" hole about 8" deep, between the mounds, and found one tunnel and set the trap in the tunnel per the instructions and without any bait.  I tied the trap to a stake and covered the 8" deep hole with a piece of particle board.  Seven hours later I checked under the particle board and there was a dead gopher in the trap.  To remove the dead gopher from the trap, push down on the upper frame arm to release the trap jaws and shake the trap and the gopher should fall out.  There is a good video on youttube on how to set this trap and here are the instructions that are on the back of the box.  http://www.doyourownpestcontrol.com/SPEC/pick-gophertrap.htm

The trap mechanism was simple and easy to understand, and after poking around for a few minutes in the yard I was able to follow a tunnel to find a place to dig and set the traps.  The traps were a little big for the tunnel, but I dug the tunnels out a little to get the traps in place (one facing each direction) and I tied them to a stake..  The next day there was a gopher in the trap.  Very simple.

review/text: The items arrived in a timely manner. I am not that impressed with the traps..zero luck so far...and the traps seem designed for bigger moles than I have (mine may be "pocket gophers"). The traps are too wide for their holes. Black Hole traps are far more effective for me.

review/summary: Absolutely worst gopher trap ever
review/text: I have caught a few dozens of gopher in my life with different but similar traps.<br />This one is absolutely the worst. If fist only in HUGE gopher burrows. The quality is bad. First time, I cut my hand twice trying to set it up (and I was going after my probably 100th gopher).<br />Save yourself some time and money.

review/summary: To Life !!!
review/text: Sun Maid pitted plums (or, prunes) are the best brand of pitted and dried plums on your grocer's shelf--period. These dried pitted plums are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too.<br /><br />However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They contain sugar (12 grams per serving) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.<br /><br />In addition, a few of these helps fight constipation really well! Don't eat too many--you'll have stomach trouble--trust me!<br /><br />However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these pitted plums are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that they do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily. In my personal opinion, I love to refrigerate these and eat them cold. They are remarkably sweet, too.<br /><br />Note: There should be an expiration date printed on the container. Eat or use these before the expiration date so you get them while they're nice and fresh!<br /><br />These pitted plums are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. Pitted Plums provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus.<br /><br />Highly recommended--to life!

review/text: These prunes arrived well-packaged, double-sealed and fresh and moist.<br />However, in one of the canisters I probably came across a half dozen prunes still containing a sharp pit or pieces of pit.<br />I almost broke my tooth on one of the pits because I bit down on the prune and wasn't expecting something so hard.<br /><br />I would not give these prunes to children or to elderly people who may have fragile teeth.<br />It is a good deal, so one option would be to carefully inspect and cut up the prunes into small pieces -- looking for the pits -- before giving to children or elderly.

These are very good and much more affordable, especially on "sub-n-save".<br /><br />The package says "large prunes" -- bunk. They're mostly small to medium with here and there a great big one.<br /><br />I put the contents of a 1-lb package into a quart container, slip a fat cinnamon stick down one side, add water to cover the fruit, put the lid on, and refrigerate. Overnight you have plumped prunes that melt in your mouth.<br /><br />Overall, a great value. I buy them regularly. Sorry, couldn't resist the prune -- er -- I mean, pun.

review/text: I'm used to eating Sunsweet Prunes and I have to say these pale in comparison taste-wise.<br /><br />These are quite dry and not pitted particularly well - I'm averaging about a pit a serving size, which is a problem I never ran into with the other brand. The upside to them not tasting as good is that I have no urge to eat way too many at one time, which is a good because of... reasons. That being said, they're also cheaper (approximately the same price for 64 oz. of prunes as compared to 50 oz.), so I might consider purchasing them again.

review/text: Very very gingery, which suits me just fine.  Also very strong chai.  Sometimes instead of equal parts chai and milk, I use about a 1.5-to-1 ratio of milk to chai.  The most satisfying chai I've ever had and more spicy than sweet.  Also sold at Whole Foods for about $1 less per quart, but the free shipping and convenience of delivery plus guarantee of availability from Amazon on this item vs. the gallons of gas my car would require to get to WF give Amazon the edge.  This is a superior product for ginger lovers only.

I've tried several main stream Chai teas over the years and, quite frankly, they're bush league compared to the BOLD, robust flavor of Third Street Chai's Spicy Ginger (my favorite). It has an intense, gingery gusto that Oregon Chai and Tazo don't have the cojones to create. It's not for those who like bland, flavorless dribble; it's for those who eat and live BOLDLY.

review/text: Iced Chai is probably my favorite thing to drink.  I have had the offerings from all the major (and some minor) coffee chain stores, as well as several brands of concentrates (Tazo and Oregon come to mind) for DIY drinks.  While they are all different and good, I find the standard (labeled Authentic, I think) Third Street brand concentrate is one of my favs.  The "Spicy Ginger" recipe is, however, my absolute favorite flavor.  If you like ginger, I'd bet you'll love this.  Also, at only 40 calories per 4oz, it's among the lowest in calorie count (if not THE lowest).  Win-win!  Yum, seriously.  I have an Amazon  subscription for this item.  'Nuff said.

For many years I have tried all kind of products in the name of health and wellness. So I'm excited to finally find a product that suits my busy schedule called Chi Green Tea Extract. Its really easy to use , I drink a full dropper of Chi Tea in warm water every morning. I find the taste of both to be delicious and I actually crave drinking it I have noticed a more steady flow of energy throughout the day since using Chi Green Tea Extract. and friends have commented that I'm glowing and looking younger (Its not just the mothers glow)<br /><br />The website I order Chi Tea is at [...] . I have found it very informative and have provided me with all kinds of fascinating facts. I enjoyed learning about anti-aging properties of green tea. Epidemiological observations have shown that people in green-tea consuming countries-mainly Japan and China-have very low rates of cancer. In Japan, the women who teach the tea ceremony, and thus drink more than the average amount of extra-strong green tea, are noted for their very low mortality rate and longevity; deaths from cancer are especially rare in this group.<br />I sent my mother a bottle in Australia and she has seen an improvement from her high blood pressure, stomach problems, tiredness and varicose veins. After drinking the Chi Tea for a few days her blood pressure was back to normal and after a couple of weeks her stomach problems completely improved.<br />I found some great research on the website [...] about the magical benefits of green tea.  Dr. Earl Mindell in his Super Antioxidant Miracle book describes ways in which green tea could help you. These ways include protective safeguards against possible breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, intestinal cancer, skin cancer, and stomach cancer. "Further," he states, "it prevents oxidation reactions in the brain, acts as an antibacterial against harmful digestive bacteria, it cures gum disease, it lowers oxidized LDL cholesterol and raises HDL cholesterol, it lowers triglycerides, inhibits viruses such as HIV, hepatitis, and herpes viruses, and acts as an antioxidant protestant against damage to blood vessels. Not only are there so many scientific facts about the benefits of Green Tea.<br /><br />Chi Tea has been endorsed by by Dr " Tea"Mark Ukra. Dr Ukra has been on Oprah several times and uses the product daily. Its also on the menu at his famous Teagarden Tea house in Beverly Hills. Click here for more info. I really just enjoy the taste of Chi Green Tea Extract. Its convenient and will make a great Christmas present to family and friends. This year the best present I believe that I can give to loved ones is good health.

review/text: Bought this product on the recommendation of Vivian Goldschmidt ( Osteoporosis Guru) as she claims Flouride is harmful to bones and green tea has naturally occurring flouride in it- this product is supposed to be flouride free.  It tastes awful!

review/text: Just as described.  Good product.  Needs to be added to iced tea or at least 8 oz of water if you don't like strong tea taste.  It's  a good way to get your antioxidants daily.

review/summary: BEST GREEN TEA EXTRACT I'VE FOUND
review/text: This stuff tastes great because it has a bit of a healthy sweetener called Lohan Kuo (I know, "Lohan," right?).  (She'll get her act together eventually, but I digress.)  Plus, it contains a bit of licorice extract, which is also sweet.  One reviewer said it tastes bad, but I disagree wholeheartedly.<br /><br />What really cool is it contains no CAFFEINE, no PESTICIDES and no FLUORIDE.  That is hard to find:  a green tea in any form without fluoride (which we all know is bad for us).  So that's a great thing.<br /><br />I had no idea that green tea helps with joint pain and stiffness and arthritis, etc. beforehand.  I was taking it for weight loss and energy.  But I found it was making my joints feel much better, so I'm moving around more, exercising more and am sleeping like a Princess (however Princesses sleep...).  I guess my joint pain had crept up on me slowly over the years and I was assuming the sleep I was getting was "normal," but when I took this stuff I noticed in only a week that I was pain free during sleep which made me realize my prior sleep condition was not "normal" at all.  Bingo, now that I'm getting better quality sleep, I'm less hungry, am moving more and have more energy.  This stuff is great.<br /><br />Previously, as someone on thyroid meds, I had to stay away from all the green teas out there because they contained fluoride (which works against thyroid meds).  Now I can get the benefits of green tea without the bad things that come from fluoride, and PESTICIDES and some of the other things that come along with the NON-ORGANIC green teas out there.  NOTE:  Not ALL organic green tea products are FLUORIDE FREE, but this one IS!<br /><br />This stuff is my new best buddy!  (PS:  I haven't gotten up to the full dropper dose yet, I'm still impressed with only 2 tiny drops sublingually.)

review/text: I love this variety of Chex mix. Unfortunately I can't find it in the grocery stores anymore, but was excited to find it on Amazon. The caramel bits are especially yummy.  I fell in love with it before I decided to diet, and now that I'm on Weight Watchers, I really appreciate finding 100 calorie snacks that taste great.

review/text: I can't find these in the grocery store anymore. After waiting a couple years, I finally decided to order some from Amazon. These are so good. I love the crunch & I love the light flavors. Neither the chocolate nor the caramel are overpowering flavors. So, be aware that these are not overly chocolatey...if you're craving chocolate, these snacks might not work for you.<br /><br />You'll receive 8 boxes of 100 Calorie Chocolate Caramel Chex. Each box contains six, .75oz or 21 grams, 100 calorie pouches.<br /><br />No information was listed when I clicked on the 'Nutrition Facts' so I'll list it for you:<br />Serving Size, 1 pouch (21g)<br />Calories 100<br />Total Fat 3gr, Saturated Fat 1gr, Trans Fat 0<br />Cholesterol less than 5 mg<br />Sodium 80mg or 3% of your daily value<br />Total Carbs 16g<br />Fiber 0<br />Sugar 6g<br />Protein 1g<br />Iron 4%<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Degermed yellow corn meal, sugar, vegetable oil, butter, brown sugar, high fructose corn syrup, cocoa<br /><br />Contains milk & soy; may contain wheat
