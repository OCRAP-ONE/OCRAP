review/summary: Stopped Using It Internally Some Time Ago, But Going to Try It Again
review/text: I used this for many months a few years ago. By using it I was able to stay off of my biggest vice; sugar. I lost some weight on it, and had more energy while I was using it. However, after months of using it I got where I couldn't stand to drink it any more (I used it by adding it to hot water or tea, as I didn't like it changing the flavor of my foods by putting it in them). Also, after months of using it the odor of coconuts was coming through my skin. I have noticed this with other foods too so it isn`t just the CO: say if I eat raw onions for awhile - or use apple cider vinegar every day - their odor will begin to come through my skin. The odor wasn't such a big deal, but I just hated drinking it any more. And, then when my cholesterol levels went up instead of down, I just quit it. And, over a period of time after stopping it my cholesterol levels came back down. But, then I went back to the sweets and it has again gone high. And, I have gained a lot of weight by eating all those sweets. So, I am going back to EVCO to help me lose some weight and keep off of the sweets. I have been taking in Organic Apple Cider Vinegar regularly - as well as Cayenne Pepper, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols - so maybe that will help keep my cholesterol levels from going high from the EVCO. Hope so...<br /><br />Oh, ironically, before starting the CO so long ago my favorite candy bar was `Mounds'. I totally loved the taste of coconut! But, after doing the CO I got where I almost could gag on it, and it took me a couple of years before I ever ate another `Mounds' bar. I was just totally coconut'd out!<br /><br />Now I will once again be drinking it, but will also use it to replace the omega 6 oil in my oatmeal bran muffins. Maybe I will also experiment this time with using it on vegetables.<br /><br />Even though I quit drinking it I have continued to use it for other purposes:<br /><br />* I use it in the summers as a mosquito repellant. It actually repels mosquitoes (more than) twice as long as 'OFF' (without the chemicals). And, does a more effective job at keeping them away. With 'OFF' some will buzz around, me; not so with CO.<br />* Also, before I go out into the garden I put some under my fingernails, and then dirt doesn't stick under my nails. And, cleanup is a snap.<br />* I have been using it the last few weeks to put in my nose so the CPAP air doesn't dry me out so much, and it is working wonderfully for that. When I first put it in I don't like the smell, but get used to it after the CPAP has run awhile. But, when I pull the CPAP mask off in the mornings the first thing I smell is coconut. But, it is much cheaper and more effective than the gel I was buying for that purpose. The gel was drying up and creating a thick paste up in there, but the CO keeps everything smooth gliding, and it also kills off bacteria etc.<br />* I tried it on my face for awhile, but it caused my acne to flair pretty bad. But, it does wonders for my skin on my legs.<br /><br />I really am hoping that this time I will be able to stick with it, without getting to hating the flavor and odor of coconut again, and hope it doesn't raise my cholesterol levels again: being this time I will be also be using Apple Cider Vinegar, Cayenne, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols to keep my cholesterol levels down. And, the CO can just be a nice `accompaniment` to those things.

review/summary: Fresh, flavorful, and hexane-free
review/text: I've tried a few different brands of extra-virgin coconut oil, and for the most part I'm equally satisfied with them all. Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar. I should specify the qualities I look for in a coconut oil: I want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste, maximum nutrition, and minimal processing. For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find "packed on" and "best before" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the "best before" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as "organic." Do a little research; "cold-pressed," "organic," AND "hexane-free" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn't found it on sale at a good price. I put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar. Great deals can be found on Amazon, by the way, especially if you purchase the packs of two jars.

review/summary: wonderful!
review/text: This is a wonderful product.  We have tried several other brands.  The health benefits are amazing.  We use it for a substitute for shortening in baked goods(pie crust, cookies, etc.) We also prefer it now for frying eggs, potatoes, pancakes, everything, as it is much more stable at higher temps. --A word of caution, if you don't like coconut taste, it will take some getting used to.  My oldest daughter(17) falls into this catagory. She is now accepting it more and more.  The other 4 kids have had no trouble making the switch.  It is interesting that we now eat more healthier fats and fats in total, yet have lost weight.  My husband and I have each lost between 10 and 15 lbs. using this product, along with making other healthy changes in our diet.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Great for baby's bottom!
review/text: I ordered this after hearing other moms talk about using coconut oil on their babies' bottoms instead of typical diaper rash cream.  The antifungal/antibacterial properties really do prevent rashes.  Our baby had already had 2 yeast rashes in his first 3 weeks after birth so I ordered this coconut oil and use it every other diaper change or when he looks red.  He has been 100% rash free for the last 4 weeks.  Also tried it out on my other son's dry chapped cheeks- worked great! I suffer from psoriasis and am considering adding some of this oil to my baths- you can't beat the fresh coconut smell either.

review/text: This is a great change from the canola oil and shortening!!  When I first got it, I pan fried some fish in it and it was really delicious. Doesn't add a lot of extra taste that you might think. Also, think it's not as stinky when frying as other oils.<br /><br /> Then I had to try it on my popcorn.  Oh, that is really wonderful.<br /><br />  Only problem I had is in delivery. The oil wasn't sealed well enough and it got warm enough during delivery to become somewhat liquid.  Some of the liquid leaked out in the box.  Just a warning if you live in a warm climate area.

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: I am back to order another container of this stuff after previously getting one for myself and one for my boyfriend (let him get his next jar himself, now that he's hooked on it.) I've tried other coconut oils and this one is by far the best. It's great that you can get such a big jar of it online...even health food grocery stores don't seem to carry much of a selection of coconut oil (and I live in granola-crunchy California.)<br /><br />This is great for cooking with, since it doesn't start smoking as soon as olive oil does. My boyfriend loves it for making biscuits as well as for spreading on top of biscuits or bread. We've used it in our "almost perfect Chicago deep dish style pizza" crust and people can never figure out what our "secret" ingredient is but they LOVE the pizza. It adds a great flavor in stirfrys and for sauteeing vegetable pot stickers.<br /><br />It does have quite a coconut flavor, which is part of the reason why we love it so much, but if you don't like the taste of coconut or you are making something where that taste or aroma might not be appropriate you probably want to choose another type of oil.<br /><br />Oh! It's perfect for seasoning cast iron, too!

review/summary: Nutiva VCO - Great Product
review/text: Amazon delivered exactly what I ordered and on time. For me, Nutiva VCO is a great alternative to unhealthy cooking oils. If we compare short-chain fatty acids (such as the lauric chains in coconut oil) which are metabolized within the mitochondria of cells, versus longer chain-bearing oils which require conjugation and transport to the liver, I think VCO must be healthier for me overall.  Nutiva also tastes good and frankly people, it's a great lotion. Yes, it takes a few minutes to sink in, but once it does, you have soft skin.

review/summary: Not a Bad Fat Anymore
review/text: Excellent product!! I have found that coconut oil can be used in any way you would use oil or butter. It has a very mild coconut flavor----nothing that would really alter the taste of what you're preparing. It can take high heat cooking without breaking down. (All the benefits of olive oil are destroyed with high heat). It doesn't need refrigeration----another plus. Tastes great on toast. Too bad the good things about coconut oil have been surpressed for so many years. It seems to be one of the healthy fats instead of all the synthetics (e.g. margarine) and hydrogenated products on the market.<br />Must be organic, unprocessed, & cold pressed to have all the good benefits.

I can tell you that this is honestly the best oil I have ever used.  It smells terrific and makes the food taste great.  My popcorn is light and fluffy like hot air popcorn, but has a nice rich taste like oil cooked popcorn.  When you open the container you are greeted with a terrific coconut smell.  For those of you who do not like coconut, it does not stay with the food once you heat it up.  Amazon is the place to buy this, the price is outstanding and this size will last you a long time.

review/summary: Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil - IF NOT BLOOD TYPE O
review/text: Actually, I'm more disappointed with my research into unrefined coconut oil than this product.  Through my internet research, I was assured that this product would take care of my cholesterol.  After eating 3 tablespoons every day for a couple of weeks, I noticed that I was becoming very lethargic and I started to have chest constrictions.  I was also giving a spoonful to my 4 year old daughter.  When I saw my daughter start acting dumb, it confirmed that my lethargy wasn't accidental.  I quickly stopped giving her and myself any coconut oil to eat.  I don't exercise enough but my daughter runs around like a top all the time.  She gets plenty of exercise and this seemed to slow her mental abilities regardless of exercise.  My chest constrictions have gone after two weeks without coconut oil.  We only use it to moisterize dry skin.<br /><br />Right after I doubted the effects of this product on cholesterol, I did a more thorough internet search and discovered that blood types O did not do well with coconut oil and it is best to avoid it.  Guess what.  One third the population in America, including my family, has blood type O.<br /><br />So coconut oil may help - if you don't have blood type O.

review/summary: I wouldn't cook with it, but it may have medicinal applications
review/text: I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that. I tried it in split pea soup that has a pretty strong aroma of its own, and found it quite unworkable.  Also, coconut "oil" is one of the most saturated fats in nature, so I'd rather just use butter for most things since it is not nearly as saturated.  Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it.<br /><br />You cannot "eat it out of the jar" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard. It may possibly work for psoriasis or as a hand cream, but remember that your body will smell strongly like coconut if you use it as a salve.  I'm pretty skeptical right now, but I have two jars so I am trying some non-culinary things to use it up.

review/summary: Is there anything you can't use this oil for?
review/text: I think not!<br /><br />OF course it is great for all the things people have mentioned, but I have found it particularly wonderful as a facial CLEANSER.  I massage a good bit of the oil over my face and neck, let it sit for a few minutes while I brush my teeth etc., then I take a warm wet cloth and wipe my face.  The excess oil comes off with all the dirt and makeup that was on my face (even the water proof mascara) and it leaves a nice light film of oil that makes my face glow, and for ONCE in my life I'm free of blemishes, even during those particularly difficult times of month! I'm in love!  Next time I'll be ordering a gallon size!

review/summary: miracle facial cure!
review/text: i had moderate acne(cysts mostly on my temples and cheeks) and dry skin that drank up lotion as though it were in famine. recently, i've been nightly steaming my face, rubbing in the oil, and then steaming it again and wiping off the excess oil. my face is clearing up exceptionally well, and instead of being both dry and oily, my skin is retaining an amazing glow. i have been doing the skin treatment along with eating a tbsp of it a day(i put it in my morning tea), and the result is nothing short of a miracle. i feel like a hippie saying it, but i am so glad i switched from putting weird chemical nonsense on my face to this routine. i also use it to fry eggs and chicken and i use it to deep condition my hair. i kinda want to preach about it to everyone, yet at the same time i want to keep it my little beauty secret.

review/summary: Bargain price, QUALITY product! (edited)
review/text: I've been purchasing the Nutiva via subscription, in the two-pack jars. Recently I found the 8 pound pail available, and decided it would be a good purchase since coconut oil has such a long shelf life.<br /><br />Having seen another review that said there was a difference between the pail product and jar product, I was concerned. However, after having used both I can assure you that the product you buy in jars is the same product packed in the large pail.<br /><br />Eight pounds of wonderful coconutty goodness, creamy and fragrant and delicious! Since it turns liquid in warmer temps, I poured the liquid into my olive oil dispenser and can now add oil to my skillets without having liquid coconut oil running all down the sides of the jar. When the weather cools down I'll have to make other arrangements, of course. But this coconut oil is fabulous and a bargain at this price!<br /><br />I might have to order another one soon as my mother likes this also, and took some of my coconut oil.<br /><br />*Edit 6-14-11: when I purchased this and raved about what a bargain it was, the pail cost me just a little over $50.00  You may find that doing the math on any additional price increases changes whether this is a bargain for you or not.

review/text: I have tried other products; this is the best deal and the best tasting.  I put it in oatmeal, other hot cereals, tea, hot chocolate, veggies, gravies, and also cook with it.  I must warn you to start out slowly, maybe 1 teaspoon daily.  It has detox properties and if you take too much at first, it will cause you to detox too quickly.  I also use it daily on my skin, including my face. If you want more information, just put a "Coconut Oil benefits" search in Google.  You can't beat the price of this oil through Amazon with their free S & H.

review/summary: A Wonder
review/text: A friend of mine recommended this product to me. She said she'd lost 20 lbs in a matter of months just from using it. I was skeptical, to say the least. I'd heard all of the bad stuff about coconut oil, but I was curious enough to research. In the meantime, another acquaintance told me about a mutual friend who'd lost 75 lbs from using Nutiva. After that, I was more than curious--I wanted to try it.<br /><br />I'd tried a different brand of coconut oil before and was not impressed. It was very grainy and hard. Nutiva is very smooth. It's got a beautiful creamy texture and is very white. It also doesn't leave a smoky smell in my home--in fact, I love the way it smells when I'm sauteeing food.<br /><br />What sold me on this product was that I read you could eat it on toast. I thought that was weird, but decided to give it a try. The first time I tried it like that, I had meetings all day. I am ALWAYS hungry, and always snacking. I really eat about every 2 hours. Well, that day, about 5 hours had gone by before I realized I was hungry! I thought it was a fluke since I was so busy that day. A few days later, I tried it again. And once again, several hours went by and I wasn't a bit hungry.<br /><br />I am convinced there is something to weight loss with this product. I've already lost 15 lbs in the month that I've used it. I would (and have) recommend this product to everyone.

review/summary: The skin of a teenager!!!
review/text: The other day my significant other looked at me and remarked..."You have the skin of a teenager". It is the dramatic improvement in my skin since I've been using this product.  First my dry hair's texture was changed within a few days and I no longer have dandruff since using this product.  Then my skin from the neck down has this kind of sheen that I have not had in 40 years...the last time I was a teenager.  Also the acne on the back or my arms, backside and back of my thighs is gone.  I used to slather on a tea tree oil lip balm several times a day.  Now I rub in coconut oil on my lips in the morning and maybe one other time during the day, on the days I do not wear lipstick.<br /><br />The thing that has struck me most is my face.  I had been through microdermabrasion, chemical peels and all sorts of exfoliating products that are now all replaced by coconut oil.  I'm not usually one for dramatic reviews, but this product has performed VERY FAR BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS!!!  Also by using this product I save a lot of money now that I no long have to use a ton of other products.  I should note that I've been using this coconut oil for the last 4 or 5 months.

review/text: I have gotten this product in smaller jars before and was very pleased so to save money I ordered the gallon tub. The coconut oil in the tub seems to have less flavor than the jars or maybe it was that particular batch. I'll know better after I try the next 1 gallon tub. I will order this product again.<br /><br />May 2011, I am half way thru my second gallon of this product and the taste is very good.<br />My only wish now is that it was cold pressed/unheated.

review/summary: Inside and out
review/text: I started using this product a few months ago when I read about giving coconut oil to my black shih tzu Pucci as a dietary supplement. He liked it immediately and his coat is glossy and his skin unblemished. I have also smooshed some into his hair before his bath as a conditioner with great success. I started eating it myself - it has a very pleasant, mild taste - and I apply it to my hair and skin before a shower which makes even my hard feet smooth and soft without being greasy. It absorbs into the skin nicely. I thought the claims of a miracle product were merely the swoons of hippie health nuts but this product has enhanced my life and the life of my dog. I like Nutiva products in general so that is why I chose it for the coconut oil and it seems wonderful in all aspects. It is part of my routine now. This size jar also seems to be an excellent value for a quality product.

I use it to make salad dressings, sautee with it, put it in smoothies, drizzle it on yogurt (creating a creme brulee-like crust), and use it as a spread on english muffins...try adding raw honey on top of it for a taste sensation.

review/summary: Healthy and Versatile!
review/text: Coconut oil has so many health benefits, it's really incredible!  We switched from using mainly olive oil to using this coconut oil for cooking, after learning that cooking with olive oil at high heats changes the chemical make-up of the oil into a health hazard. I had never used coconut oil before, and now I use it for everything!  Coconut oil can be substituted for butter since it is a saturated fat.  I use it for baking, stovetop cooking, and as a moistuizer for my skin (it works great, isn't real greasy, and it doesn't contain synthetic toxic ingredients like conventional lotions.) The 54 oz size is a great deal!  I can't wait till it's back in stock!

review/text: I have been using coconut oil for cooking, baking, and just spreading on toast & vegetables for about a year.  My whole family and friends are hooked on it.  It is so delicious and it is very good for you too!  I had to start buying it in this larger size because we were using up the 1 pound size so quickly.  It lasts for years too, so no worry about it going bad.  It just makes more sense to buy this size and save money.  I still buy the smaller size to take with me on vacations.  Wouldn't be without it!!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because even though this brand is very good, I have tasted some that is even better.  But the price of this is very good. Thank you for carrying it on your site!

review/summary: Great Alternative for Conditioner!
review/text: I've been using this product for 2 months now, and it's AMAZING! I have wavy hair and it's very fine. I've noticed that whenever I use deep conditioners or any other type of conditioner, my hair will fall out excessively. So I decided not to use conditioners, instead I use Nutiva's Coconut oil daily (only on my ends & on dry hair) and it leaves my hair incredibly soft, shiny, and easy to untangle! I also use it once every other week as a deep-conditioner (through out my whole hair & leave it in for half an hour to an hour), and my hair doesn't fall-out as much as it does with other conditioners!!! I seriously LOVE this product, my hair feels a lot healthier and it's also more manageable, I also get a lot of comments on how shiny and silky my hair looks! I really recommend it. My only suggestion is, if you dislike the smell of coconut, this product is not for you. The smell is very strong and tends to linger on the hair, personally I love it! And one last thing, a little goes a long way with this product, if you apply too much, your hair will appear greasy!

review/summary: Good oil, but raw foodists beware "extra virgin" is not the same as raw!
review/text: This oil is extra virgin, but not raw. It is cold-pressed, but the processing tempurature rises above that of truly raw foods. Email Nutiva if you want more details on their process. They had the info on their site at one time, but I could not find it there today. Aside from that, this giant tub of oil is great for hair and skin. About once a week I saturate my hair with this oil and leave it in for 15 minutes to 1 hour before I shower, then I shampoo 2-3 times so my hair's not greasy and do not need conditioner for a few days. I also apply the oil to my skin after I wash, but while still in the shower. Then I just lightly rinse the oil off with water only, after giving it a few minutes to soak in. This way my skin gets moisturized without that greasy residue that usually takes so long to soak in. Good for when you are headed to work and don't want that greasy look for an hour or so after application. Nutiva previously had a truly raw version of this oil, but just found out from their website the Nutiva folk's supplier of the raw oil could not keep up with demand so they had to remove it from their site! There are other brands of raw available on other internet sites, but have yet to see any on Amazon.

review/text: In 1892, pathologist William Osler described a whitish area on a heart, the telltale sign of myocardial infarction.  In hundreds of thousands of autopsies over two centuries, none had been found before.  As consumption of vegetable oils increased, heart attacks became increasingly common.  By 1930 they were the leading cause of death in America.<br /><br />I prefer the fats that people ate for thousands of years before the epidemic.  Nutiva smells good and can be spooned in winter.  It's cheaper than some brands.  Large jars are practical because it stays fresh on the shelf for many months after opening.

I read them all and am on the phase I or the Coconut Diet at this time and very pleased with my weight loss so far and even more pleased with the fact that I do not stay hungry...  that morning omelet that I have with a grapefruit is so filling that I have no interest in the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake or pie out there lol ... amazing for me let me tell ya!! lol.  Although I do eat later in the evening a salad and either fish or chicken and drink lots of water I am satiated and feel great!!  I certainly do recommend this product and for those of you that believe the stories that have circulated for years that coconut oil is among the bad oils for your heart... please order either The Coconut Oil Miracle book or the Eat Fat Look Thin book and read for yourself that this oil actually prevents heart disease.

review/text: I tried the Nutiva brand after purchasing another brand of coconut oil. I love the taste of this brand and use it all the time - my local health food store has it on sale quite often. Coconut oil has many uses - I just scoop out enough product and place in storage containers to use on my hair/body and the rest stays in the kitchen to use for cooking. I find that it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin when I need to address dryness. Sometimes I add a drop or two of Eucalyptus essential oil to  the coconut oil and apply to my body as well. Works great as a hot oil treatment for your hair - since coconut oil is in a solid form at 76 degrees or less - just heat up a small amount in a container and apply to your hair.

I wanted to share something so others may find this helpful. I work with Veterans as a volunteer and advocate i have one vet who has poor circulation in his legs and feet he also gets blood clots. He has had the swelling for almost 20 years , he is grumpy and miserable and normally hates to try anything new and will always complain about things no matter if its good or not. we went to his dr and they did not want to put him on more meds due to possible liver issues and so i mentioned could i try the coconut oil that i have , the dr said sure give it a try . so when we got back i brought the oil over and rubbed it into his legs and feet then put a coconut body butter over it and put his socks on, the next morning i stopped over to check on him and i was looking at his legs he was so amazed he was in shock just in 12 hrs his legs had gone down and the pin and needle s feeling had lessened, i continued for a week we went back to the dr and they were shocked and asked what it was i was doing , i explained the product and what i did they wrote the name down and was going to try it with other patients. this vet raved about how great it was and has kidnapped my jar and has had me go get him a case to keep on hand. it not only brought the swelling in his legs down but the cracking and dry skin on his legs and feet were gone  and the color was no longer purple  i will always keep this product on hand and use it for alot of my veterans who have skin issues.  but make sure with your dr before you use it...

review/summary: th best coconut oil ever
review/text: Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is the best coconut oil I ever tried. Its pure and natural. I never seen coconut oil so raw and the texture is smooth as silk. Its easy to mix with other ingredients. Once you try this product, you will never go back to your old coconut oil again. I  mix it  in with my favorite hair conditioner. My hair never looked this great.<br />I microwave it for 20 seconds, mix with favorite hair conditioner, place onto hair while its warm. cover my hair with plastic cap for and hour, and rinse with cool water. The results are great. I would never use any other coconut oil only Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. It's the best.

review/summary: Coconut Oil is awesome
review/text: It was not too long ago that I learned that the common understanding about nutrition is completely wrong, for example, saturated fats such as butter, lard and coconut oil are very stable, and do not break down in high heat. Moreover, this trait is protective of human health, plus, we should be eating MORE fats due to the need for the fat-soluble vitamins. (Don't even get me started on the cholesterol fraud.) So I was thrilled to learn I could obtain coconut oil on Amazon.<br /><br />The coconut oil arrived quickly. After having used 'polyunsaturated' oils for so long, I chuckled to see the coconut oil was solid, hence, the tub, rather than a narrow-necked jar.<br /><br />I got the tub in summer, so somewhere along the way, the stuff got soft and slid sideways. But no prob. And yes, when I run out, I'll get more from the same place in a heartbeat.

review/summary: Very good product
review/text: This is a very good product. I had a strange area on my leg that always itched and even my doctor didn't know what it was. I think it was some weird fungus I picked up in the hospital years ago, because that's when it seemed to appear. I tried all sorts of creams to get rid of it and after reading up on the benefits of extra virgin coconut oil I decided to try it myself. The area has healed and I still use this as a moisturizer for my face every night instead of all of the expensive products that I used to buy containing "peptides" etc. I also have started eating it and feeding it to my pets every day. I think we all look a lot healthier.

review/summary: I like this oil also~
review/text: I've tried just about all the coconut oils out there.... I like this one and Aloha Nu. I eat it right out of the jar, cook with it and I use it on my hair. It's great for chemical damaged hair. I put a little bit on my hair after I shampoo, then I straighten it with my instyler. Makes my hair shiny and smooth. If I didn't, I would look like I stuck my finger in a light socket. lol  :-) Great price also for this oil. Others are very spendy.

review/summary: Love that Coconut smell!
review/text: I only give this product 4 stars because it comes in a plastic jar.  Glass would be much better on the environment- but also more expensive so...On to the product!  This coconut oil not only smells great, but tastes great too.  I put 1/2 TBL in my fruit smoothies, use it in my raw icecreams and puddings, and even use it in my hair products. My favorite use for the coconut oil is as a hot oil treatment; 1/4 cup mixed with 10 drops of rosemary.  Despite the plastic, I will probably continue to order from Nutiva as I did some research before purchasing and find them to honestly care about producing a wonderfully fresh and organic product.

review/text: The Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Jar is superb.  We use it in the kitchen (for cooking, baking + pastry crusts), and for our skin and hair. See: "The Coconut Oil Miracle" book.<br /><br />Also, this 54 ounce jar is a better buy--not only because the purchase contributes to less packaging waste on the planet--but this larger quantity calculates to more cost effectiveness per ounce.

review/summary: Outstanding value, superior taste
review/text: We've been buying our coconut oil from Whole Foods as well as other health food markets, but we decided to give Nutiva coconut oil a try mainly because of the price offered on Amazon. To our suprise this oil has exceeded our expectations! It smells wonderful and tastes good too. It is at least on par or superior to the products purchased at Whole Foods and health food stores but at a much lower price. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to family and friends, only problem is that most people are still sceptical of the health benefits of coconut oil. When I mention the use of coconut oil, most people just shake their heads and respond that they're not into "crazy fad diets". Too bad, their loss.

review/summary: A great big jar of yum!
review/text: For those looking for a healthier alternative to butter and vegetable oils, coconut oil is great!!! I use it as my primary cooking oil, so this large jar is perfect for me. It doesn't need refrigeration like other coconut oils I've purchased, which is convenient.<br /><br />A neat thing - some doctors actually recommend daily doses of coconut oil. Also, you can use on your skin (which is better for you than petroleum-based products).

review/summary: this stuff is wonderful - buy it NOW
review/text: After losing 75 lbs. on Atkins Induction, I hit a stall and wanted to add some variety to my WOE. Low carb forums mention coconut oil as a healthy alternative to plain old vegetable oil so I ordered a jar of Nutiva EVCO. If I didn't like the taste, I figured that I could use it as skin lotion.<br /><br />This stuff is GREAT! So far, I have used it to season beef patties, chicken , steamed veggies and omelets. (Tried it in coffee - not so good). This is my new favorite food item.<br /><br />Some folks complain about the coconut smell but I like it. And it has helped get me past the stall - I actually lost a couple of lbs this week.

review/summary: Nutiva organic coconut oil
review/text: This is a really nice value, and a delicious product. Be sure to read up on the benefits of raw coconut oil, and remember, never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat. I'm actually a raw vegan, so this is a big staple for me. I love massaging sea salt and coconut oil into raw kale salad. Add ginger, cayenne, a bit of tamari, and a squeeze of lemon. Healthy and delicious! If you aren't a raw vegan, but you just want to eat healthier, try replacing all your regular oils and butter with raw coconut oil. Coconut has a much higher tolerance for heat before it becomes harmful to the body. It's way more tasty than butter or any kind of butter substitute too. This coconut oil is raw. It smells amazing and is super healthy. I use it for everything, from salad dressing to raw vegan deserts, to stir fry, skin moisturizer, hair finisher, massage oil, etc. It's amazing on baked yams. If you eat toast, try mixing raw coconut oil with honey and using it as a spread.

review/summary: Excellent for cooking!
review/text: If you are looking for a healthier oil to cook with than corn or mixed vegetable oils, try this product. My husband read about the benefits of coconut oil in the book "Patient Heal Thyself" and in "The Bottom Line" publication a few years ago. Previously we have had to purchase this at health food stores, relying on their stock at the time. Now we can order it here and have it in a couple of days. The product itself is wonderful, and arrives in a plastic container, which is safer around the kitchen. As long as you keep it in a cool place it will keep a long time. The only thing I Don't fry with it is garlic. For some reason that combination is putrid, but onions, peppers, chicken, green beans, pork chops, are all delicious and the coconut adds a light, sweet flavor of its own.

review/summary: Gets rid of scabs
review/text: My cat had scabs and bald spots all over her body. She scratched her whiskers off, had plaque on her belly she couldnt stop licking and had a rodent ulcer on her lips.  My vet put her on pred and cortisone shots and i put this in her food twice a day. The meds made her so much better but i noticed when i didnt put the fish oil in her food her scabs came back. I bought the 33 ounce container last time and it was way too big, went bad and smelled awful so i buy the small container and it lasts a few months. Great for pets with skin allergies. Finicky pets wont taste or smell it in the food. Great fish oil. The only con is the bottle leaks everywhere, i have to put a paper towel underneath the bottle.

review/summary: Deceptive.
review/text: The only good thing about this food is it improved my German Shepherd's gas. =/<br /><br />It seems like a good price, until you realize that it requires 50% more food by dog's weight. So, with Iams and Purina, my 104-lb dog gets 4 cups of food a day. With this Pedigree, he needs 6. This is because the first ingredient is corn, and it has a lot more fillers in it.<br /><br />My dog doesn't like it (although he doesn't like Iams either!) so it's taking a long time to go through our bag... but we will not be repurchasing. The Purina gave him horrible gas, so I guess we are going to stick with the super-expensive Iams that he doesn't like, because at least then he doesn't smell like a rotten egg all the time.<br /><br />Skip this food if you have a large breed dog unless you absolutely HAVE to get SOME food. I would only buy it again if the store was totally sold out of other food. Purina and Iams are both better choices that wind up being the same or cheaper per feeding.

review/summary: Awesome snack for toddlers!
review/text: These are wonderful snacks...I like them, but I buy them for my 1 year old son.<br /><br />These are a little expensive and hard to find (reason for 4 stars), but compare the price to Gerber or even store brand freeze dried fruits made for babies...you definitely get more for your money here. Plus the kind packaged for babies are such tiny pieces, my son's outgrown them, and the bottom is filled with fruit dust...and you don't get much more than what's in one of these single serve packs anyway.<br /><br />These do crisp (for those of us with a mouth full of teeth), but they melt away just like the baby ones do, so they are awesome for new self feeders (with just a few teeth or none at all). And I love that there's no added sugar. I used to break them up into bite size pieces for my son, but now he's figured out how to use those front teeth--they're really airy so easy for him to bite.<br /><br />The packets work great for me! I can throw 1 or 2 in the diaper bag and go. If you have left overs, they tend to get a little soggy (reabsorb some humidity from the air) so it's much better to keep the servings packaged separately.<br /><br />Love these, wish they were easier to find.

Since the slices are so thin, they crush easily and every package I've opened has been at least 1/2 crushed up little bits of fruit.  This is great if you're adding them to something, such as oatmeal, but not so good for eating out of hand. I will not order these again, as I had purchased them for my baby and they are too small for his little fingers.  Overall, I'm disappointed in this product and will not reorder.

review/summary: Crispy dried peaches- good snacks
review/text: Instead of the usual leathery dried fruit, these peaches are freeze dried, and end up crispy, like a chip.  The peach flavor isn't really strong, but they're still good. It's a perfect diabetic/special diet snack.  They are low-calorie, and no artificial ingredients.  The other flavors are also REALLY good.

review/summary: Bland
review/text: They kind of taste like peaches. They kind of look like peaches. But they just don't seem like peaches.<br /><br />The big problem with freeze-dried peaches, there's no juice running down your chin. Peaches are juicy, that's part of the fun of eating peaches, getting juice all over. A dry peach chip tastes pretty good, but it just doesn't seem like a peach.<br /><br />The other Brother-ALL-Natural fruits are amazing. They make for the best darn portable snack, apples, pears, and strawberries. They are great flavors and nice way to eat that fruit. Sadly, the peaches just come in a bad last on the fun side of eating.<br /><br />The peaches aren't bad; they just aren't anything special either. These are natural peach slices that are freeze dried. In other words, all the water is removed from the fruit, leaving the vitamins and fiber intact. Freeze drying is a non-chemical process (it isn't exactly natural, although if the peaches were left in the Antarctic, they would eventually freeze dry - all the water would sublimate out of the fruit like freezer burn). This is a product of China.<br /><br />The variety pack is a much better choice:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001942GAI">Brothers-ALL-Natural Variety Pack Crisps (Fuji Apple, Asian Pear, Strawberry/Banana),  2 - 12-Count  Bags</a>

review/summary: healthy snacks
review/text: All of these fruit crisps are fabulous!  I am a diabetic, on intensive insulin therapy, which means that I cannot eat most snacks without taking an extra insulin shot.  Since I already take a minimum of five shots per day, I'd really rather not have to take a shot for a small snack.  Well, I tried these because they do add fruit to my diet, and are fairly low carb.  Much to my surprise, not only do these crisps NOT raise my blood sugar, but it actually lowers it!  So, I have a delicious, satisfying snack and do not need to take that extra insulin shot!  This snack is a real winner!

review/summary: Utterly Flavorless
review/text: Unfortunately, these particular snacks are just flavorless. I ordered them and the shipping was quick and simple, but the snacks themselves ended up in a post office food drive because I just couldn't see them going to waste on my pantry shelf. Sorry to say, I had hopes they'd be subtle and tasty, alas they are practically powdery and bland.

review/text: I am in LOVE with the fuji apples version. Peaches are my favorite fruits and I thought CRISPS might have done it again! But I was sadly disappointed because these peaches are not sweet at all.

review/text: I like these but they are a lot like the apples.  Some of the peaches taste more like peaches but not all.  I will still eat them.

review/summary: Not as good as the other flavors....
review/text: I love all of the other flavors by the company. I also love the freeze dried peaches by other companies. These have a good texture but are sour and lack much flavor.  Pass on this fruit... I really wanted to like them.

review/summary: Outstanding
review/text: The mushroom's are large and of outstanding quality. We use them anywhere instead of button mushrooms.  The real secreat here is to use the warm water that remains when you reconstitue them, in your dish.  We use it when making reisots and it makes all the difference in the world!  These are quality mushrooms, and cheaper than buying the same mix (fresh)at the grocery store.

review/summary: Fat? Um, I don't think so! These are very THIN!
review/text: Looking at the photo, I thought these would be a little thicker than they are.  I mean, they are called "FAT Spizzle Twists".  They are NOT FAT.  In fact, they are super, uber thin.  They are not packaged in any sort of plastic or wrapping, either.  These super thin twists were tossed in the box with my order from EntirelyPets, completely unwrapped.  They are so thin that my Smooth Collie snapped them in pieces with little effort.  Honestly, I don't think they are worth the dollar each I paid for them.

review/summary: Not that great.
review/text: I thought by the retail price that these would be nice sticks. They are very thin, and my dog can wipe through them like any old treat. Wouldn't purchase these again, as the quality is just not there. They say "fat", but they are far from it! I paid $1.00 each - that's probably a fair deal.. But now they are $3.49 each, and that's a rip off.

review/text: I was introduced to this tea a couple of years ago. Since then, I've dumped Twinnings, Lipton, and all other Ceylon Teas. It has that unique taste that comes all from a single bag...It is un-believably a perfect cup of tea....

review/summary: Rich flavorful wake me up taste cylon tea.
review/text: I have ordered third time this time. 100 tea bags a box and six boxes to an order. The taste is very rich very flavorful and no bitter taste like the PJ Tea. Nice like the Brookbond red label but a notch down in strength. However, it definitely says wake up. I have gifted this boxes to quite a few tea totlers  and got them instantly hooked. For the price I might start a supply business. ;)<br /><br />Each tea bag comes neatly packed in its own packet which is another feature I like over Brookbond. It is smoother in taste than Tettley and Lipton now really taste with no class at all. I found it actually by accident in an European grocery store while looking for Bigalow Cylon tea. The price per box there was $8.00 which I thought was overly high. So long as this is a great price on Amazon and on super saver free shipping I will continue to buy it here at Amazon.<br /><br />Update: Aug 1, 2012: Just placed my second order. Come Holidays I will place extra orders if the deal remains the same to give out as gifts. I have assortments of tea in a Tea server actually 9 different brands and types, but nothing compares to Impra.

review/summary: Size Does Matter
review/text: Well, I read the prior reviews and ordered based on those, that was my first mistake.  My second was not verifying ounces described.  I received my box today and for the price I paid this is definitely not what I had imagined.  For $34.00 I could have gone to my local grocery to the old world section and bought a nicer selection to make my own gift box and it would have cost me alot less.  I bought this for a gift and hope that it tastes better than it looks.  At this point this is the only reason I have not returned it, more hassle to return and the hope that quality is better than the quantity.  I don't recommend the item for the cost as there is more filler paper than product in the box.
