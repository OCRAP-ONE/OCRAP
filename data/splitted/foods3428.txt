review/summary: Good pumpkin, bad cans!
review/text: This product is really good pureed pumpkin, but I have a problem with the cans.  I took out one can from the outside of the case to make pumpkin bread.  It is wonderful pumpkin...dark orange, tasty, full of pumpkin goodness.  However, a few days later I removed the rest of the cans from the case to put them in my cupboard.  From the middle row, right in the middle of the case, there was one can that was SO badly damaged, that I am afraid to use it for fear of me and my family getting sick from bacteria.  Now, please tell me how a can that is SO badly damaged, packed in the middle of a case, can go unnoticed by the person who is packing the case???  Or, are you that big a company that you have automation packing these cases, and it is just a strange coincidence that the only dented can ended up EXACTLY in the middle? I feel the can was placed there intentionally so that I would not notice, nor would Amazon (the shipper), no matter what side of the case it was viewed from.  Folks, we are not stupid, and we will get to that middle can eventually, so you are not hiding anything.  As the end user of this product, I feel that this can of pumpkin should have been caught at packaging and thrown in the trash...just as I have to do.  It's all about quality control.  This has raised the price per can by about .25 cents.  That means that instead of me paying $2.36 per can, I have now paid over $2.60 per can.  You have a great product, but I have a problem with a company who tries to pull the pumpkin over it's customer's eyes. Pumpkin is WAY to hard to come by right now and I was happy to have found your product on Amazon.  But, it has turned out to not be such a deal when I have to even throw away one can of pumpkin.  I give you a five star rating for your pureed pumpkin, but I deducted two stars for the wasted can.

review/summary: damaged goods
review/text: I received these the other day and 2 cans were severely damaged, I had to throw them out, and 5 other cans came with minor dents. They were packed together so it didn't look like the damage took place during shipping.<br /><br />Edited note:<br />Today is May 30, 2009 and I just wanted to post that Amazon wrote to me and told me this problem has been rectified. I'm happy about that because I need to get these for my dog and at times they are hard to find. Plus it's a great product.

review/summary: 2nd order with amazon
review/text: This is my second order and the cans arrived perfectly packed with no dents on any cans.  I am giving this to my basset hounds in hope of helping them with their anal glands issue.  But I may use some to make pumpkin muffins. My dogs love the puree in their food and I am glad to give them organic.  Although I don't think pumpkins are susceptible to pesticide spray since you dont eat the hard skin and the pesticide probably cannot penetrate the thick skin.

review/summary: Can issue resolved? No problems with cans, just with texture
review/text: I was hesitant to order this because of the recurring complaint of damaged cans, but then noticed that those reviews seem less recent, and it looks like the shipping issue was resolved (I selected the "Amazon Frustration-Free" packaging).  The cans arrived in perfect condition, before their use-by date, etc.<br /><br />However, the texture of the pumpkin seems a bit off. We add the pumpkin to our dogs' food. Before buying this product, we typically used the large can of Libby's brand. The texture of this product is much firmer than the canned Libby's we were using, and it even looked like there was some congealed fat in the "Farmer's Market" can, which seems odd for pumpkin. Another difference is that it doesn't seem to be firming up our dogs' poop like the Libby's pumpkin did (sorry if TMI!). We will probably stick with Libby's once we finish the cans from this order.

review/summary: What a waste!!
review/text: I got hit by the same problem many others have...dented cans.  Of the 12 cans in the case, eight were dented.  When you divide the purchase price by the four useable cans that comes to $5.55/can!  RIPPPPP  OFFFFFF!!  As many others pointed out, the box was fine, it was just the cans inside.  I planned to return the offending cans, but in the meantime, I opened one to give some to my dog.  I thought I was buying pumpkin puree but instead I bought orange water.  Now that pumpkin is in stock at my local grocery stores again, I shall return to Libby or Publix brand.  You get 100% pumpkin (be sure you choose pumpkin puree, NOT pumpkin pie filling).  No water and no dents and most important only $1.49/can instead of $5.55/can.  I couldn't give this product zero stars which is what I wanted to do.

review/text: This canned pumpkin was purchased for my dogs, wonderful benefits for canines.  No dented cans, good packaging.  I will never buy any other pumpkin again even for my family's use.  The pumpkin we used to buy in the grocery store is watery, this pumpkin is firm, no filler or artificial coloring.  Texture is similar to stiff mashed potatoes. Simply the best!!

review/summary: Fiber for dogs
review/text: When my male dog developed recurrent anal gland infections, the vet recommended adding canned pumpkin to his meals for fiber.  Unfortunately canned pumpkin is a seasonal item in local stores.  I was very excited to find this item available via Subscribe and Save.  I have occasionally found dented cans but not frequently and not severely enough that we can't use them anyway.  Both my dogs enjoy it.

review/summary: I stock this year-round!
review/text: I use pumpkin in baking and for breakfasts year round for the taste and nutrition benefits. Going the organic route is SO much better than the stuff that predominates around the holidays. Just looking at the color of the pumpkin in the can you can see the organic is more natural. Farmer's Market is consistently good and buying it on Amazon is cheaper than getting it at Trader Joes or Whole Foods.

review/summary: This pumpkin is the best -- if you're using it for the same reason I am
review/text: This is the best pumpkin available -- if you are using it for your dogs or yourself. I have two dogs with issues -- one is older and has a little trouble with upset tummy from time to time, and the other was on prescription food -- but this product fixed all that.<br /><br />Now they can eat the same food as the dogs with no issues -- and they all love it! That is a nice plus -- if you are worrying that your dogs won't eat pumpkin, I will be surprised if they don't eat this. My pickiest dog thinks it is wonderful.<br /><br />I also eat some of it myself, because I read somewhere that it is good for humans too, and I like the flavor. However, I didn't try to bake anything with it, so I can't say if it makes good pie or pumpkin bread . . .<br /><br />When I read the reviews, I was a little worried about getting dented cans, but mine were fine -- no dents at all, and nicely packaged in a box.<br /><br />Five stars and two thumbs up from me -- your experience may vary . . .

review/summary: Watery and Bland
review/text: I found it to be watery. At least, more so than other canned pumpkin. It's likely less watery than fresh pumpkin puree, but definitely more watery than Libby's or the generic brand at my grocery store.<br /><br />The texture upon opening this organic one was smooth while the other was irregular. It made my pies taste a bit bland as well, but I also made a mistake with the crust (too much water) so that had a hand in my pie disappearing in two days rather than one.<br /><br />I really liked the art, though. The label. It's nice.<br /><br />Basically, it won't make a fantastic pie, but it'll do. Especially if you would like organic. I suggest straining through coffee filters (placed over a mesh colander) overnight or longer.

review/summary: The Best Canned Pumpkin
review/text: I've been using Farmer's Market Organic Canned Pumpkin for a couple of years now.  During the great pumpkin shortage of 2009, Amazon seemed to be the only place that I could find canned pumpkin and so I decided to take a chance.  It is perfect!  It is creamy and smooth with no additives.  When it became available for Subscribe and Save, I jumped at the chance.  Buying it locally was a bit cost restrictive at about $3 a can.<br /><br />What do I use so much pumpkin for?  I first learned the wonders of pumpkin from Hungry Girl's daily newsletter.  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312377428">Hungry Girl: Recipes and Survival Strategies for Guilt-Free Eating in the Real World</a>).  Sugar Free Devils Food Cake mix and a can of pumpkin = fudgy brownies.<br /><br />Then I inherited a cat with, ahem, problems.  Poor little thing.  While refreshing my pet care knowledge, I read about folks using canned pumpkin for their dogs.  What the heck.  Gave it a try and it seems to help.  BUT!! now she won't eat her meals without it.  She's hooked on pumpkin--a pumpkin junkie.  Thankfully, with Farmer's Market Organic, I can rest assured that, like her cat food, there are no harmful additives.<br /><br />Sadly, I've been unable to get the pumpkin from Amazon of late.  I even resorted to that other named brand and the difference is startling:  stringy and off colored.<br /><br />Fortunately, Farmer's Market Organic pumpkin is available in my local stores once again, however I am going to miss the Subscribe & Save option.

review/text: I love pumpkin for baking and cooking, but my puppy loves it to keep her digestive system running smoothly. I ordered a case of these for 1.63 per can.  As this can be such a hard product to find, that was a great deal for me.<br />I also use this for teething treats by  freezing little bits in ice cubes (for freshness) and letting the puppy chew on them to help her gums.  There is no sugar or other ingredients and very low water content.<br /><br />I also did not have the problem that others encountered with the cans denting.

review/text: Due to our dog's  intestinal issues it was suggested we give him a couple tablespoons of pumpkin with his meals. Not the pie mix, but pure, organic pumpkin.<br />It was pretty pricey at the pet store and not available in our supermarkets since it is a seasonal item. I always find the best deals on Amazon and this was one of them. Good price and FREE shipping on two cases, that stuff is heavy so the free shipping and no tax was a welcome reward. Now that Max is over his tummy upset we continue to give him this  product. You can also use this for baking, adding your own sugar and spice.

review/summary: great product
review/text: I'd like to first make a note, after reading other reviews, I hesitated to buy this pumpkin because of issues with dented cans. When I received my order, every can was in perfect condition, and well packaged.<br />As far as the product goes, I love this pumpkin for baking purposes. I make excellent pumpkin muffins with this and when I ran out and used conventional pumpkin, I was disappointed. So, we are hooked on this pumpkin, it's a must have for my muffins.<br />I did read in other reviews that some folks that feed pumpkin to their dogs didn't like this product, and I will say that my dog who has digestive issues does better on the conventional pumpkin (I believe it has more fiber than the organic), and she doesn't like this kind much. But I'm not basing my 5 star review on my dog. She can eat conventional and we will eat the organic.

review/text: I was so happy to see all twelve cans in pristine condition and with "use by" dates two years off stamped on the tops.  Another highly pleasant surprise came when I had my first taste.  This pumpkin is without a doubt better tasting than Libby's.  With the Subscribe and Save discount, this superior product actually costs a tad less than what I pay for Libby's at my local store.  And with the added convenience of home delivery!  I use a couple cans each week because it is loaded with nutrients and fiber and being a thick puree it is very useful in creating good things to eat.  I have put about a tablespoon on a dish for my cat twice and she ate it up both times which rather amazed me.

Like other reviews said, these dents don't appear to be from them being shipped as cans that were even packaged in the middle were dented, makes you think they are selling the companies "seconds" or something.

review/summary: great pumpkin
review/text: We love pumpkin soup and eat it year round, not just during "pumpkin season".  And I make a pumpkin macaroni and cheese that even company raves about.  Normally I wouldn't serve mac and cheese to company, but this particular recipe is definitely 5 star quality. (I do not make pumpkin pie - don't like it.)<br /><br />I was really happy to find this brand on Amazon in 2011 for half of the price I pay through my food club when the product is on special sale.....and about 1/3 of the price that is charged when it's not on sale.<br /><br />It's really good pumpkin.  My original review gave this pumpkin only 4 stars because at that time it didn't come in a BPA free can.  It is now October, 2012 and I recently received a second case from Amazon and was delighted to read "BPA FREE" on the label.<br /><br />Thanks, Farmers Market, for caring about our health!  You earned your 5th star.<br /><br />The pumpkin is still a very good price now in 2012 IF you order it in the "frustration free packaging" from Amazon, but only slightly less than my food club.  But, hey, pennies count!

review/summary: GREAT Organic Pumpkin delivered with NO damaged cans!
review/text: I ordered this pumpkin because my cat needs it in his diet. The first time I ordered many months ago, half the case was damaged, the company was having "packaging issues". But they assured me (their customer support was fantastic! Extremely nice, helpful, and friendly, and they made it right just as promised!) that they would take care of everything and they did, fast too! I originally ordered because it was "organic", which is very hard to find in the stores! I reordered when I was getting low. I received the case, the cans were perfect, and because of this product, my cat is alive and well! It was VERY important that my cat have this, so yes, I am VERY thankful they are still selling this product! I will continue to order it as long as I need it! THANK YOU VERY MUCH FARMERS MARKET FOODS!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Chris

review/summary: Is this manufacturer using Amazon to close out damaged cans?
review/text: Our dog gets pumpkin in every meal -- if yours does too, you know why.  You also know that one can only stash so many cans of pumpkin, and that somewhere in the spring most supermarkets start running out of canned pumpkin and can't get more or stop ordering it (understandably).  So, I was happy to see this product on Amazon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as other reviewers experienced, many of the cans arrived dented. In fact ALL 12 CANS were dented, most severely so.  Thing is, unless Amazon wrapped the cans to the case flats, this was not an Amazon issue.  The case pack was well buffered in a larger box that was completely undamaged; neither the shrink-wrap nor the flat were damaged; and even the inner cans in the case were bashed up.<br /><br />This clearly indicates that the manufacturer -- or whomever wrapped the cases -- shipped already and obviously damaged cans.  I checked the product listing and there is no mention of these being seconds.  My message to manufacturer, distributor and/or Amazon: check the product or change the description so people know they are taking their chances.<br /><br />Thankfully, Amazon customer service came through with an offer to replace or refund.  I'm giving this one more shot for my dog's sake, and will hope for the best.

review/summary: 8 of 12 Cans Very Badly Damaged (Dents)
review/text: Being unable to find canned pumpkin in any of my local stores, I held my breath (after reading the mixed reviews and mentions of damaged cans), took a chance and ordered a 12 pack.  Of the 12 cans, only 2 arrived undamaged.  Another 2 had small dents, which shouldn't affect the product or make opening the cans a problem.  Unfortunately, the 8 remaining cans are too badly dented to use.  Dents deep enough to have bent the cans sideways, and in the case of top dents, probably make it difficult/impossible to fully open with can opener. These will be discarded. Since some of the cans are dented on the top while others on the bottom, and the two undented cans were on an OUTSIDE row and the most severely dented on the INSIDE row, it appears that the cans were dented prior to packaging and not damaged in shipping.<br /><br />It is disappointing to see that damaged product is still a problem so many months after the first reviews called attention to the issue but an Amazon customer service rep. promised that someone would look into the issue to try to ascertain just where the damage is happening.  I haven't actually tried the pumpkin in the any of the 4 'safe' cans yet, so my review isn't based on the actual quality of the pumpkin but given the outrageously bad condition of the packaging there's no way I could rate this higher.

review/text: I received Farmers Market Organic Pumpkin 12 pack yesterday. 5 out of 12 cans were pretty badly dented, another 2 not quite so bad. Packaging was not damaged and cans were bubble wrapped inside the box so it wasnt packaging or delivery. These cans were sold and shipped already dented. Don't blame UPS. I will keep and use them they are dated 2013,however this is hardly what I paid for ???? . Someone is obviously taking full advantage of the pumpkin shortage to unload their dented can inventory. Buyer beware!!

The cans inside were bent, covered in fuzzy black mold, wet, and I couldn't get them out of the house fast enough. Our dogs eat pumpkin and we go through a lot, so I was happy to see that Amazon could provide us with a case.  I would not recommend this product - it is a health hazard!

While Amazon will pay for this 12 pound box of unusable cans to be returned and I will eventually get a refund - what a waste. Once returned there will be no ability for anyone to use this product due to the dents - Botulism anyone?

review/summary: Ridiculously Dented and Damanged Cans
review/text: We eat pumpkin on a regular basis and it gets hard this time of year when all of the stores are sold out.<br /><br />I saw reviews here on Amazon saying the cans were dented, but saw that someone from the manufacturer had responded so I figured the problem had been addressed.<br /><br />NOT SO.  I received a case of these cans and it was wrapped extremely well - bubble wrap all over the place.  However, the cans INSIDE the case were dented and damaged - I don't mean a little dented, I mean several of the cans had their entire sides caved in in such a way that I could not open one can and on another can I couldn't remove all the pumpkin because the can was smashed so badly.<br /><br />Those most damaged cans were packaged in the middle of the case - seemingly intentionally disguising how badly damaged they were.  The cans on the outside were relatively OK, ALL of them were dented a little - every single can - but the ones on the outside were MUCH less damaged than the ones on the inside.<br /><br />I don't see how this could have been accidental, although anything is possible.<br /><br />The quality of the pumpkin itself was good, but I don't like using damaged cans in case the food inside has been compromised.

review/summary: A good price for a good product.
review/text: First, I want to review the product itself. I've used this brand of canned pumpkin before, so it was not new to me. I find the flavor to be a little more like a fresh pumpkin and the texture to be a little less creamy than mass market brands. But not to a degree where it causes problems in any of the recipes I use it in. The cost per can of ordering here on Amazon is less than what the local natural food store I usually buy it at sells it for. And since they were very low on stock last time I bought it and had no expected restocking date, I figured the savings and availibility made it worth the risk of ordering online even after reading the reviews.<br /><br />Which leads me to the packaging. Yes, as many other reviewers have reported, cans were dented. The outside packaging along with the other items in my order were in perfect condition, it was not until I got to the "ready to ship" flat of cans that were pre-packaged by the manufacturer that I found any damage whatsoever. 8 of the 12 cans had dents. However, they are only small dents and don't affect the safety or quality of the product in any way. I wouldn't have hesitated to purchase the cans off of a store shelf in this condition since the product is in very short supply, so it isn't a problem for me.

review/summary: Super Canned Pumpkin
review/text: At a time of a "pumpkin drought" in the commercial market, when I couldn't find a single can of pure pumpkin in any supermarket, finding this product was a miracle!  We use pumpkin daily, as an addition to our dogs' diets, in order to keep their digestive systems in peak condition.  And Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin is exceptional. It is slightly thinner in consistency than the store brands we've previously purchased which makes it excellent for its intended purpose. That it is organic is an added plus.

review/summary: 4 out of 12 cans dented
review/text: I HAD to have pumpkin for my dogs so I rolled the dice after reading the mixed, but mostly dissatisfied reviews. One third of the cans were very dented. However, none were bulging which is the sign of spoiled food. We are using the dented ones first without issue - on the third of four right now.<br />I must agree that it looks like a manufacturers "error". The dented cans were hidden in the middle of the case, surrounded by good cans. I would bet my last dollar that Farmers Market Foods is using Amazon to dump what they knew wouldn't sell on the supermarket shelves!<br />Lastly, I will purchase this item again, dents or no dents and use it unless it's bulging. But it's unnerving knowing that something sneaky is going on at an organic food manufacturer.

The cans were obviously not bent or damaged in shipping.  The cans were crated, wrapped in bubble wrap, and packed in an undamaged Amazon shipping box.  It was as if someone picked through the cans and packed dented and bent cans.  I considered returning the order but needed it right away.  I use the pumpkin to moisten dry food for my dog which eats special food for severe allergies.  The pumpkin was fine but the impression created by the vendor with the condition of the cans was not acceptable.  I do not intend to order from this vendor again.

Delivered within a couple of days.  Cans were in great shape.  One can had a small dent.  I'll order from Amazon again when we run out.

review/summary: Very pleased to find this product
review/text: We were very pleased to locate this pumpkin on Amazon.  We have a dog with a very sensitive stomach.  We have included pumpkin with her meals for years but have not been able to find pumpkin in our local grocery stores and were told that there would be no canned pumpkin until Fall 2010.  Thanks for having this available.

review/summary: Every can dented
review/text: Like several other reviewers, my order just arrived and every can is dented.  None of them seem to be compromised so I will use them.  Just disappointing to receive something like this from Amazon.  I know it probably isn't their fault but they are still shipping it from their warehouse.  Would hate to receive other products in this condition. Farmer's Market should be ashamed of themselves. Having said that, I am pleased to receive them and so is my cat!  I have a feeling that people will be grabbing as much as they can of the 2010 pumpkin crop.

Not just a little ding here or there.  Bad dents to the point of being afraid to eat it. They had to be dented BEFORE they were packed because they were inside cans.

review/summary: My cats say "Paws down this the best canned pumpkin on the market"
review/text: My cats are canned pumpkin connoisseurs, though I do wonder about their street cred because they like the awful crud in Libby and other generic store brands.  That said, this brand got a paws up from all of them.  The crazy critters will lick it off a spoon when I open a can.  Once opened though, the magic is gone.  It returns once mixed with their raw meat. :)<br /><br />I use this brand for my pumpkin recipes because it tastes fresh and is not watery.  I'm fortunate to have received intact cans, so I'm sorry to read of others' experiences.  The product though is excellent quality.

review/summary: great quality at a good price -- and so happy that I found this!
review/text: I had been searching far and wide for canned pumpkin, but to no avail until I came across this product.  Until finding it on Amazon, I had never heard of this brand before.  After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant, but I love pumpkin, so I placed my order.<br /><br />The items came in less than a week (I ordered right before the Memorial Day holiday weekend).  Every can but one (which had the slightest dent) was in excellent condition.  The cans were packed in a cardboard tray, shrink wrapped and then bubble wrapped before being boxed for shipping.<br /><br />The taste is just right to me -- pumpkin, not too light or too strong.  The consistency is not too thin or too thick, but again, just right. The quality is comparable to (if not better than) its brand name competitor.  The product is organic pumpkin, period.<br /><br />My compliments and gratitude to Farmer's Market Foods. This was my first experience with this product, but I assure you, it will not be my last!

review/summary: Another Brand is Better
review/text: There was a pumpkin shortage in our local supermarkets, so I resorted to ordering this case online.  Besides the fact that ten out of the twelve cans were dented, I used one can out of pure desperation.  Yes, I was desperate for pumpkin.  It's watery.  It's not solid packed.  And using the same ingredients I always do in the dish I used it, it was sub par.  I have since sent the product back mainly because of the dented situation - otherwise, I probably would have given it to a food bank or something - they don't take dented cans either and rightfully so!  Amazon took it back and I'm sure will be crediting my money.  I WISH I HAD READ THE OTHER COMMENTS before I purchased this.  Beware of dented cans.

Thrilled, I did 'Subscribe and Save'. I fully expected the expiry to be soon, as is often the case with Amazon, but the stamped date was a flmost 3 years from now, yaayyyyy! It is wonderful pumpkin, and a safer can than most brands, double yaayyyy! Not one dented can, another surprise. However, now that I set up auto-ship, the price zoomed up. That seems to happen a lot. I'll probably cancel if it doesn't go back down a bit when I need more.

review/summary: Terrible for Pie!
review/text: The first time I used this pumpkin, my pie was TERRIBLE (goupy, flavorless), and I figured I must have done something wrong. I made my next pie with Libby's, and it was perfect. So I decided to try the EXACT SAME RECIPE with the Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin again tonight. AWFUL!! Watery, miserable. I let the pie bake longer, in the hopes that it might thicken up, but it's still goupy and doesn't taste pumpkin-y at all.<br /><br />The pumpkin itself was thin and lumpy as I mixed the ingredients, and while I think I managed to work out the lumps, it just wasn't very "pumpkin-y" smelling or tasting.<br /><br />I will NEVER buy this product again. I prefer "natural" and organic alternatives, and I know that they can sometimes require recipe adjustments, but this is just unacceptable.<br /><br />"Certified Organic" apparently doesn't always mean a better product!

I buy all my groceries from them, so please, blame the seller, don't blame a good company that always attempts to do their best.  I'm giving this product five stars because the pumpkin is excellent; have been buying it for years at a local gourmet & organic store.  Now I'm buying it from Amazon.

review/text: I found this canned pumpkin kind of bland and it needs extra spices to boost the flavor of it.
