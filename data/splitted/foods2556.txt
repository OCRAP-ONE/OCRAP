review/summary: Root Beer of the Gods
review/text: Abita is best known for their wide assortment of actual beers, but I'm here to tell you that the real magic is their Root Beer. I've tried dozens of Root Beers from micro-breweries all across America and have never had one that can hold a candle to Abita's remarkable brew. It must be that "pure Louisiana cane sugar" or something, cause it really is nothing short of amazing. Smooth, creamy-yet-crisp, and of course best when very cold. Unfortunately, it's hard to find reliably where I live, but whenever I find a six pack or two I snatch them right up. Should you be so lucky to stumble across some, you should too.

review/text: I purchased three boxes of these for Christmas presents all on the same day--December 1. The first two were sent. The last one never got sent. After 1.5 months of waiting, I canceled the order today and will have to apologize for the delayed Christmas present. I will say that the two who did receive the root beer were satisfied. I may try to purchase the root beer again, but I will watch the shipping much more carefully, will order even earlier, and will cancel if the item does not appear it will arrive on time. Very disappointed.

review/summary: Low glycemic/low sodium AND Delicious
review/text: I love pretzels and I love peanut butter.  This is a great combination of both.  It is low (or possibly medium) glycemic if you are worried about such things.  Has whole wheat and fiber and is low in sodium.<br /><br />The only thing I would change is to use real peanut butter and not peanut butter made with sugar.  It doesn't help the flavor in my opinion and cuts down on the health factor.

review/summary: Poor customer service
review/text: I ordered both xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very, very strange, foul smell.  Kinda like mothballs.  They get some of their products made in China (the erythritol, apparently), so I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination.  I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund just for the strange smelling items (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable).  She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again.  Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one of the same thing since I'd never ordered from them before.  (Note:  I only wanted a refund for the unopened bags of the item in question.  I did not ask to return anything else in the order.)<br /><br />I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same.  Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site.  While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me.<br /><br />I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc.  Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried.  I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective.<br /><br />NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar.  They are also available here on Amazon.com.<br />Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />-I ordered a wide variety of things, including this item:  erythritol, xylitol, gum, candy, etc.  It included this item and a lot of other things.<br />-I asked only for money back on items I tried that were suspect as being defective, and then only for the items I had not opened.<br />-I asked the manufacturer if the items were safe to consume, given the very odd odor some of them emitted.<br />-My review concerns primarily the customer service problems I had, as well as the concern with the origin of their products I had ordered in general.<br /><br />Personally I think it is odd that when I called to return a small part of a rather large order that the customer service rep did not want to honor the guaranteed refund posted on the web site.  She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing.  How was I to know the substance would smell so badly?  She said I should have just ordered one.  What difference does it make since I had only opened one?  The others were perfectly sealed.  She said she would take them back after much ado, and then said they would never accept another order from me.  (Like I would anyway after that).<br /><br />I stand by my post.  If you have had a good encounter with their customer service, I am happy for you.  That was not my experience.  They should not post a guaranteed refund when they don't mean it.

review/text: This stuff comes from China and Cargill, king of GMO foods.  Emerald Forest xylitol is also from China even though it's advertised as American birch.  Now, it may have been birch at one time but Xylitol Canada bought them in 2010.  An employee at EF spilled the beans and I listened on the phone as she got chewed out by her boss.  Even without that little confirmation, the chances are certainly slim that EF would produce real quality American Xylitol when they are in bed with Cargill.  Too bad the FDA won't get involved.

review/summary: These noodles are great
review/text: I have to say I was very skeptical about these Miracle Noodles.  They are on this high protein meal plan, so I decided to try them to add variety to my meals.  Taking them out of the package I was still skeptical; blanching them in the water I was still skeptical.  Once I added them to so WF Alfredo sauce with chicken strips I was pleasantly surprised.  The texture is a lot like regular pasta, they take on the flavor of the dish you are cooking and considering the fact that they are high fiber and no calories they will be in many more of my dishes.  Even my 10 year old picky eater loved them; the best part is that she could not tell the difference.

So I bought this and some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TOB8QW">Walden Farms Calorie Free Pasta Sauce Alfredo -- 12 fl oz</a>. I lost the weight but I was able to notice a texture difference with these. I know for some people that is a big deal. I just manned up and dealt with it. Having said that, I stink at making noodles and can never get them right. I have friends that make them and they turn out lots better. So would I recommend them, definitely. Who wouldn't love the no calorie deal and if you team it up with the walden calorie free stuff your meal is basically calorie free. Its a great way to cut your calories down for one meal a day. Dont drop your calories too low though. Thats not a healthy thing to do.

review/summary: Add it to your homemade potato salad for rave reviews!
review/text: My family has always used Old Bay Seasoning for steaming crabs and shrimp, and I also add a small amount to other fish dishes.  A few years ago, however, I discovered what would be my favorite use for it...potato salad.<br /><br />I have never liked deli potato salad and am pretty picky about homemade.  My sister-in-law made some for a party, and it was the best I had ever eaten.  I asked her what her secret was, and she ran down the usual list of potato salad ingredients.  Then she told me she added Old Bay Seasoning.  Bingo!  That was it.<br /><br />I went straight home and made my homemade potato salad, grabbed my can of Old Bay, and sprinkled away.  I can't say exactly how much I use, because I never measure ingredients when I'm making my own recipes.  Just add some, stir it up, and taste....add some, stir it up, and taste till you like it.  The seasoning does not overpower the salad flavor at all, just enhances it.  Don't be concerned that there is going to be a crab or shrimp taste to your salad; it isn't the Old Bay that makes crabs and shrimp taste like seafood.  Old Bay just makes seafood taste better, and now potato salad too.  Try it on your homemade potato salad; I think you'll love it.

I believe, just like wine, coffee is each individuals own taste but, try this one for a smooth, powerful wake up! Also very satisfied with the brand for great packaging and fast delivery.

Much much closer to LaVazza - not terribly 'muddy' in flavor (not a lot of Ethiopian for added feel either).  There's a bit of caffeine in here, though, so there's probably a Robusta bean or two in this mix, but for flavor, it's really good.<br /><br />I took a flyer on 5lbs of it, but at the same price as Safeway's house brand, way better.  Makes me wish I had a better grinder, this coffee's got more potential than I'm getting from it right now, I think (using a Capresso Infiniti and 1980's-era Gaggia Coffee espresso machine).

Disappointed because for over a year now I have been ordering their products direct, and paying $15 per 5lb bag of beans shipping. so about $90 in shipping costs that could have been avoided, (and applied to beans instead)down the tubes. Nevertheless, I will continue to enjoy this fine product, and will of course be ordering from Amazon instead of direct.

review/text: Took a chance on this blend and the decaf Columbian from the same company to make my preferred half-caf blend for my espresso machine (a superautomatic Gaggia). Very pleasantly surprised by freshness of beans, and good aroma and taste (just a touch bitter on the aftertaste, which I am okay with). At the subscription rate, this is a great deal for good beans. I mix up the two bags, package them in freezer bags with the air pushed out, throw the bags in the freezer, and still getting good coffee on my last bag from this mixture.

review/text: I doubted the other reviews of how good this coffee was, but decided it was worth a try anyway.  Quite a gulp to order 5# of a bean you've never had.  But comparing this to several attempts at Lavazza and Starbucks espresso's I can say that these are very good, most especially for the price.  They beat many of those we paid much more for.  We will definitely consider repurchase, although that will take a while with so much to go through.  On the other had, two-a-day's are now cheaper to make, so we might get through the bag faster than we thought.  Nice smooth forward coffee flavor, not burnt or harsh - or wimpy either.  Gourmands may differ with me, but I like this coffee.

Their only drawback is that they don't have quite the sharp chocolate taste that I have been used to, so I rated them four stars instead of five.  Otherwise they would be the best, especially with some of the chocolate out there using GMO ingredients.

I immediately contacted Amazon making them aware of the mistake and without question Amazon immediately replaced the item.  Unfortunately, Amazon reshipped SWEETENED, AGAIN!!!  I now have 24 cans of something I will not drink because of the sugar content, thus the reason for UNSWEETENED.  I gave up trying to get the correct order from Amazon.  So, essentially, I spent all of that money for nothing.  AMAZON NEVER GOT THE ORDER RIGHT AND DID NOT HONOR IT BY SENDING ME THE CORRECT ORDER OF UNSWEETENED PINK GRAPEFRUIT JUICE OR REFUNDING THE MONEY TO MY ACCOUNT.

review/summary: No substitute for fresh ground pods, but inexpensive for quick beverages
review/text: When I am making chai or Turkish coffee for friends I always grind whole pods (a quality product is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FVPAZ8">Indus Organic Green Cardamom Pods, 3 Oz</a>). Sometimes, though, I want to quickly brew a chai or a fast Turkish coffee (or even flavor regular coffee when brewing). This ground cardamom does the trick.<br /><br />Turkish coffee with cardamom is both easy to brew and delicious to my taste. Just add cardamom to the grounds and make it your preferred way.<br /><br />Cardamom is also a key ingredient in spiced chai (masala chai). I Normally grind a pod with a part of a stick of cinnamon, clove and a single black peppercorn. I mix it in a half and half water and milk mixture that I bring to a boil, add black tea and grate a piece of ginger).  When I am lazy, use powdered ginger and this ground cardamom. Not quite as good as freshly ground pods (and grated ginger), but significantly better than most chai mixes you can buy off the shelf.<br /><br />This spice is also used in sweet dishes and pastries, but I must confess that I have to forgo sweets for health reasons so know little about how it's used in that respect.<br /><br />For sweetening coffee, chai or even desserts I recommend using one of the following in lieu of processed sugar: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F5K5N2">Goya Panela Brown Sugar Cane 1 Lb - Redonda</a>, known as "jaggery" in India. A convenient alternative is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050IM27Q">Turbinado Sugar - 1 box, 1 lb</a>. Either is especially superb with chai.

It's especially tasty served with rice and makes a great side or lunch since it needs no refrigeration until opened.  I would buy this again as well as try some of their other products.

The chickpeas are firm outside but soft inside. The chickpeas are a bit firmer than I am use to when I cook them but still really good. This is great alone or poured onto rice. When I do use rice I prefer more bengal lentils and less rice, maybe 60/40. This is really tasty, especially for being a packaged product!<br />The best thing, it is vegan and gluten-free!

review/summary: Decent Indian cuisine in minutes.
review/text: For those of you who like Indian food, and do not know how to cook it, or want to spend the time preparing the cuisine, these are a good way to get a decent meal on the table in the time it takes to make rice.  Though not as great tasting as the Real Deal, they are okay.  Our son is at college, living in an apartment, so makes a lot of his own meals.  He loves these as he knows he can have a meal on the table in 20 minutes.  These are also a good way to introduce those who have never had real Indian cuisine, since most are not that spicy/hot.  Buying an individual pouch can be expensive, but once you find ones you like, buy a case.  They keep forever in the pantry.

review/summary: Quite nutritious
review/text: This is one of the most filling tastybites I have tried. It is a bit too oily (just a bit), but not too salty, and the quantity and bite are quite nice. Spice is mild, lentils are borderline crunchy (but not too much), and it goes great on rice. One of the good thing about lentils is their very high fiber and protein contents. Enjoy!

review/text: I like several of the tasty bite meals, but I have to say this one is my least favorite so far. The lentils are kind of tough to me, the skins are quite hard. The spices are okay. I will likely finish what I have, but I probably won't buy this again. The Madras Lentils are far better.

review/summary: Yummy and healthy (for packaged food, that is!)
review/text: I love these! I have a very sensitive gluten allergy, and when I found out all of tasty bite's Indian foods are gluten free (less chance for cross-contamination), I tried these at my supermarket. I felt completely fine after I ate them.<br /><br />When I was camping this summer we brought along a couple and that's when I looked at the nutritional info. If I eat the whole package it is just 300 calories, but almost half my iron needs and 12 grams of protein! I'm not watching my weight, but I am trying to gain muscle and I don't like to eat a lot of meat. It was kind of bad before I found this because on the road I would just eat a lot of Christie's rice crackers and potato chips.<br /><br />The taste is good, great for packaged food. I love food, and so of course it doesn't really compare to stuff we make at home, with homemade chicken stock and fresh vegetables, but it is my absolute favorite packaged meal, and has a ton of nutrition!

review/text: These are the best chocolate covered gummy bears ever!! I originally got these at the Sweet Factory but when I went back to get more they just didn't taste the same. It turns out they changed the company who provided their muddy bears and they weren't nearly as good. When I asked who made the old bears I was told they were Koppers. Thankfully I was able to get more online and they are the same great Muddy bears. I highly recommend them!

review/text: My wife and I fell in love with chocolate covered gummi bears about 5 years ago.  We used to buy them from the local candy store but then we wanted to have them as part of the treat boxes on the tables at our wedding a year ago.  At the local candy store price, that was a bit expensive.  So we ordered bulk of these well before the wedding  so we could make sure the quality was similar... we ended up having to order more before the wedding because the quality was the best so we ate too many ourselves!

review/text: I love this stuff!  I was a hard core, 4-6 cups a day coffee drinker for about 10 years. I would wake up and if I didn't have coffee right away, I got a horrid headache.  Well, one day I became sick with a nasty head cold and the coffee didn't sound as appealing as hot honeyed tea so I drank that and used exedrine for the headache and caffine.  After a few days without my normal jug of-joe-, I just didn't crave it anymore like I used but I still wanted something in the morning.  I tried a bunch till I found this.  The flavor is wonderful- mellow & sweet- I would buy it for the flavor alone but the extra health benefits are nice. I can't way to try it iced too!

review/text: I've noticed little reaction from using this tea.  Having used detox in the past, there were certain things I expected, even in a mild form, that never showed, so I am honestly unsure of any detoxing qualities of the tea.  Also, it has a strong cinnamon flavor to me that was very unexpected and as I don't like cinnamon in a drink, unpleasent to me.  But, if your looking for a mild detox stimulant and dont mind cinnamon, I'd say give this tea a try.

review/summary: it was an acquired taste
review/text: I  first bought this as a subscription, so it wasn't TERRIBLY expensive. I found the first box to be unpleasant: it tasted thin and acrid.  But I kept drinking it as I was eliminating caffeine and thought "detoxing" would alleviate the symptoms of caffeine deprivation.<br />After a couple weeks I was caffeine free, headache free and grump free -- well, less grumpy than the week before. :D<br /><br />I had several unopened boxes which I put away.<br /><br />Fast forward a year, I caught a cold at New Year's Eve. I looked through my shelves for all the tisanes in my house. I soon drank up all the ones I like. I figured since I was sick, I wouldn't be able to taste it anyway, so I started on the Detox AM. I was fully recovered in 4 days -- that's a different story: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000UJJSY">Cold-Eeze Homeopathic, Sugar Free Unflavored Tablets with Zinc, Gluconate & Glycine - 48 ea</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00170CVF4">Ricola Coughdrop, Honey-Lemon with Echinacea 3oz</a>, lots of Vitamins C and B-complex, and rinse that sinus congestion away! Baby Nasal Aspirator By Apex Medical  But I'm still drinking AM Detox.<br /><br />It's not my favorite tisane (that's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LM5SKW">Herb Tea, Tension Tamer, 20 bag ( Value Multi-pack of TWO(2) packs of 6 )</a>), but I definitely now appreciate its lightness and health benefits.<br /><br />WARNING: Don't let the tea sit unrefrigerated; I left a half full teapot overnight and found out the hard way that this herb blend ferments super easily.

review/text: A review for cookies?  Why not?<br /><br />My wife and I love Oreos.  Every once in a while she picks up a bag at the store and we eat some with milk.<br /><br />The problem is that we feel compelled to finish off the bag before they get stale.  Since all the kids are gone that's tough.  It's not really good for us and after 3 or 4 nights it gets kind of old.<br /><br />Recently she got a 12 pack assortment of cookies which contained Oreos, Nutter Butters, etc.  I wondered if there was a way to just buy a whole bunch of "snack packs" for Oreos and sure enough Amazon has them.<br /><br />Now we can have that 6 cookie "fix" without having to remember to pick them up at the store or worry about them going stale if we don't finish them off.

review/text: Three important details about me:<br />1. I have a ridiculously fast metabolism so I always want snacks.<br />2. I'm a student often stuck in long, boring lectures or labs.<br />3. I'm cheap.<br /><br />That's why I was so elated when I found this deal.  I already love Oreos and I'm always searching for small snacks I can shove in my backpack when I'm running out the door.  I tend to buy boxes of snacks and just cycle through them: peanut butter crackers, Nutty bars, bags of M&Ms, Moon Pies, etc.  The 48 pack of Oreos was my most recent one and definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />They're packaged pretty lightly in little bags of 6 Oreos and I find it to be the perfect amount so that I'm satiated but not wasting any due to losing taste.  One pack of 48 will last me at least a month (sometimes I eat two or three packs in a sitting, okay?) so Subscribe & Save seemed to be my perfect snack solution.<br /><br />Of course I didn't realize how much Subscribe & Save sucks.  The price on these literally doubled after my first month and I had to cancel my subscription.  That said, the product is great but don't trust subscribing through Amazon.

review/summary: Still The Best.....
review/text: I have had an Oreo addiction since just about the time I knew what a cookie was.  Its funny how Oreos have managed to hang on and become such a family favorite despite all the competition of much fancier cookies that are available.  No nugets going on here, chocolate bits, caramel, icing, or peanuts either.  Just a tasty chocolate cookie shell with a delicious vanilla filling.  Keeping it simple has been the best policy for Oreo lovers for decades now. These little packages contain Oreos that are a smidgen' smaller than the regular box or bag sized variety.  What the cookie and candy industry refers to as the fun size.  That might explain some of the negative comments as to these Oreos being rather cheap with the filling.  In my opinion the ratio is the same, they are just smaller.<br /><br />This 12 pack is an excellent buy on Amazon.  Buy two of them and you get free shipping and for the majority of us, no sales tax.  A fine buy if you have a lots of Oreo fiends in your home that prefer a measured amount of these great cookies.  Like a lot of other reviewers here I tend to eat less of them when they come in the little packages as such.  Great classic Oreo cookies at a good price.  Highly recommended...

review/text: To the tune of "Cryin' Time by Buck Owens<br /><br />Oh it's dunkin' time again, You're gonna eat me.<br /><br />I can see that cravin' growing in your eyes.<br />I can tell by the way your tummy's growlin'<br />That it won't be long until it's dunkin' time.<br /><br />Now that diet that you're tryin' leaves you edgy<br />that's the way it's happened every time before<br />And as sure as that's a glass of milk you're pourin'<br />It won't be long before it's dunkin' time.<br /><br />Go on, you know it has been your comfort food as long as you can remember!<br />Double Stuff is just more fun!
