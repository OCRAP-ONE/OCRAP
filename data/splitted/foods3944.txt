review/summary: Sugar is natural
review/text: If you are anticipating peanuts, salt and nothing else, this is not for you.  Sugar is a major ingredient as well as some type of added oil which I assume keeps the naturally occurring peanut oil in suspension (i.e., you don't have to stir this one to mix the peanut oil back into the peanut butter). Sugar may make this more appealling to the kiddie set, however.  If you are mixing true "natural" peanut butter, try using a hand mixer with a single blade; hold the jar tight, and mix away and in 30 seconds you're finished (unless you didn't grip the jar tightly enough, in which case you have to clean the kitchen, too).

review/text: I hate it when manufacturers chose to use misleading terms and try making the product more desirable than it actually is.<br />Yes, Natural it is, but not really when its got added 'natural' unneeded crap. Can't stand when some live-and-eat-by-manufacturer americans who couldn't care less or are ignorant upvote an unhealthy product. Unhealthy only because they add unneeded sugar and palm oil..heck they could have just added HFCS and these same reviewers would have given them 5 stars still ! Wake up America !! Get off the coke !!

review/text: To me "natural peanut butter" means it has nothing but peanuts in it. That is the way we get them from the ground.This is Skippy trash and lie. This product is not natural! It has added ingredients. They add Palm oil which is a saturated fat and is not healthy for you. They also add sugar and salt. ???always found in Natural peanuts............NOT!!! Don't buy this crap. Amazon should not sell this as natural. Now I don't trust Amazon any longer!

review/summary: concentration on bottle is wrong, bottle tip is poor for drop dispensing
review/text: In the description for Sucralite the concentrations stated is 1 drop is equal to 1 teaspoonful sugar.  However, the bottle says 3 drops = 2 teaspoonfuls, which would be 33% less concentrated.  I contacted the company and they stated that the online description IS accurate but that the labeling on the bottle is wrong.  My unscientific taste test, compared to EZ-Sweet, suggests that they are honest as the sweetness does seem equal to EZ-Sweet, i.e. 1 drop = 1tsp.<br /><br />More importantly, this bottle design is NOT ideal for delivering drops. I just addidentally put a bunch into a cup of coffee, ruining it.<br /><br />Just ruined some more coffee.

review/summary: Great Cajun Seasoning
review/text: This has a nice flavor for just about everything and the "heat" is  not overwhelming - although I have been known to add a little cayenne depending on the dish.  Try tossing this with some EVO on some sliced (like fries) yams, sweet or red potatoes, cook in the oven at 375 for about 40-50 minutes - serve with aioli. I bought this once years ago and have not been able to find this large affordable size since.  After several attempts to recreate or come up with a better alternative on my own (the ingredients are listed except the critical one "spices" is not defined!) I conceded and ordered more.  Well worth it!

review/summary: Excellent Seasoning
review/text: If anyone has ever had the fries from the fairly famous restaurant chain "***** Guys," then you know what I mean when I say their Cajun Fries are spectacular.  I bought the McKormicks Cajun Bayou brand seasoning to try to make my own fries.<br /><br />The shipping was amazingly fast, I got it before even the estimated delivery date.<br />The seasoning tastes great.  It's not quite like "the Guys" but I'm getting closer.  I know they fry in peanut oil so I am going to try that next.  I have also heard they double fry their fries.  I am going to try to figure out how to do that.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent product and seller.

review/summary: Delicious spread that has the power to transform most sandwiches into a real gourmet treat
review/text: Skillet is the name a popular Seattle area food truck owned and operated by Culinary Institute of America trained chef, Joshua Henderson.  After working at a variety of top restaurants (including a stint as Head Chef at Beverly Hill's Avalon), Josh moved back to Seattle, bought a 1962 Airstream trailer and now serves gourmet food out of it to Seattle's night-time crowd.<br /><br />Skillet's signature item is simply called "The Burger" and what really sets it apart from other deluxe, $12 hamburgers is a generous slathering of Henderson's own creation, Bacon Jam.  When I first encountered this product I was so blown away by it's heavenly, bacon-rich flavor that I rushed to my computer to find out how it is made.  This is from Skillet's website: "... we take a big bunch of really, really good bacon, and render it down...add a bunch of spices..onions, etc. and let it simmer for about 6 hours...give it a quick puree, blast chill it...and you have bacon jam..."<br /><br />This stuff is great!  It has a thick, spreadable consistency with hints of powdered chilies, brown sugar and vinegar.  It gives a somewhat subtle but unmistakable bacon taste to whatever you spread it on.  Hamburgers are a natural, but I have used it on paninis, grilled cheese sandwiches and a baked potato.  This will be a regular item in my house.  I should be able to use Bacon Jam for things other than sandwiches and I look forward to experimenting with this wonderful spread.

review/summary: About the product and packaging/shipping which affects the product
review/text: Note: I'm discussing the packaging and shipping issues here because I was not able to do so via Amazon's special feedback section for packaging and shipping and there is no way to contact Deals on Call LLC that I can find, but I wanted them to be aware of this. It is also relevant as it affects the product you may purchase for yourself or others--especially if you're having it shipped as a gift to others. I'm taking the time to write this to give you information you may want and to save you time.<br /><br />Had researched this product online as I had seen it mentioned (with praise) on several TV shows, as a gift for my many bacon-loving friends. Was a bit concerned about whether or not it required special packaging (cooling, etc.) during shipping after reading some comments here on amazon and elsewhere. (My personal experience with items that require any sort of special cooling, etc. is that stuff arrives in unusable state. This is often the fault of the carrier, FedEx, UPS, etc. rather than the manufacturer or shipper.)<br /><br />Called the company in Seattle (Skillet Street Food) and asked whether the product required cooling/refrigerating during shipment. Answer: No. (Information was not on website. Had also sent an email suggesting they add that information AND the nutritional content on their Web site. When it comes to food products, you can NEVER have too much information. I was surprised that I had not found it in the info about the product in the Amazon listing either.)<br /><br />I then ordered the three pack (cheapest option price wise). Paid for next-day delivery and it arrived in less than 24 hours. Excellent.<br /><br />Opened the smallish box. Now given the size of the three jars and the box, there was not enough of those packing pillows to hold it in place and it was clear that the three jars (placed inside a simple plastic bag and not fixed in place via any method) had moved around during shipping. Plastic jars not damaged, but they easily could have been from hitting each other during handling, etc.<br /><br />The first thing I wanted to check was the seals as my research said that if the seal is broken, the product has been compromised and you cannot eat it (See info to come from the company.) Well, the lid on one of the jars was open and loose, there was some greasy film around the rim of the jar...and when I opened it, half of the seal was open and the jam was coming out.<br /><br />Now, this is actually good news. It alerted me that the jar had been compromised and I immediately tossed it. (The seals on the other two jars were fine; no film; lids secure.)<br /><br />Called Amazon customer service and explained what happened; it was unclear to me who had handled, packed and shipped the actual order--amazon or Deals On Call LLc. Still not sure. I requested a replacement jar, which they could not do, but they did refund me the entire amount so I could reorder another three jars, which I will do.<br /><br />It is still unclear WHEN the seal came open and what caused it. Because of what I do in my "real" life, I'm a stickler about health and safety issues. Since it was unclear as to who did the actual handling, packing and shipping of the bacon jam jars for this order, and I could not contact the vendor (Deals On Call LLC) directly to relay the problem about what may have happened in shipping, I did ask Amazon to do so. And I'm sharing it here.<br /><br />But I went a step further because this is the product of a small-biz in Seattle and having seen the web site for the company, where they actively solicit feedback, I thought it made sense to alert them to this issue so they could possibly alert the folks who buy from them to be aware that seals could come open after the product left Skillet Street Foods and was handled elsewhere (retail, etc.).<br /><br />When I reached them (no annoying voicemail but an actual person responsible for the product who was professional and courteous), the person explained how units are checked individually to ensure seals are secure, before they are lidded and sent on their way. He also knew the vendor associated with this Amazon purchase, and could vouch for their reliable and professional service (which I assumed given their high ratings on amazon). More importantly, he said he would discuss the packaging issues<br /><br />Net-net: Seals can open, but this is apparently rare. You should be alert. If the seal is open, air has gotten into the jar and the jam should NOT be eaten. (This could explain why some folks have had an issue with the taste while others are raving about the jam.)<br /><br />>>Jars are shelf-stable until open. Once open, they must be refrigerated. There is a use by date on the bottom of each jar. You can freeze the jam if not opened and used by that date (good to know).<br /><br />Again, this information is not on the Skillet Street Web site that I could find (as of this writing) and not here on amazon posting. It should be added. Along with the nutritional information and ingredients.<br /><br />This is what is on the jar itself:<br /><br />"Store it in the fridge, serve it at room temp and use or freeze by date printed on bottom of container."<br /><br />FYI: Just reading that wording, it's unclear whether "store it in the fridge" applies to when you receive it. Or after you open it.<br /><br />Perhaps the wording should be revised so it says. "Refrigerate after opening." As so many labels do, to differentiate from those that require no special handling or those that say "Keep refrigerated."<br /><br />One should never assume that it's clear. Example: We buy pickles in a jar. They are shelf stable. Until we ordered a new kind. Imagine our surprise, when opening several days later, they were off. Our bad because we had NOT read the packaging which said: Keep refrigerated. It was delivered with other groceries when we were not at home or we might have noted that it was with the refrigerated items in our order, not the canned/bottled items!<br /><br />Nutritional Data:<br />Serving size: 1 Ounce<br />Servings per container: 7<br /><br />Calories: 80<br />Calories from fat: 60<br /><br />Total fat: 6 g, 10% (Saturated fat, 2g, 9%)<br />Cholesterol: 10 mg, 3%<br />Sodium: 350 mg, 14%<br />Total Carb.: 3g, 1% (Dietary fiber: 0%)<br />Sugars: 3g<br />Protein: 4g<br /><br />Ingredients: Uncured bacon, no nitrite or nitrate added except those naturally occuring in Celery Powder (pork prepared with: water, salt, turbinado sugar, celery powder, lactic acid, starter culture (not from milk), Onion, Balsamic vinegar (organic wine vinegar [from juice of organic grapes]; organic, concentrated grape must; organic caramel sugar), Brown Sugar (sugar, invert sugar, cane molasses), Water, Salt, Pepper.<br /><br />FYI: that "concentrated grape must" is not a typo. I will google this as I am now curious what must is.<br /><br />I can't speak to the taste of this as these are gifts. However, once my recipients report back, I will add this feedback.<br /><br />Very impressed by Skillet Street Foods as the creater/manufacturer of the jam who appears genuinely interested in improving all aspects of product and delivery, and, as always, very pleased that Amazon could deal with the problem quickly and easily.<br /><br />Would have been happy with just a replacement jar but Amazon went the extra mile.<br /><br />Hope that the nutritional information and ingredients and the details about usage will be added to the Skillet Street Food online shop and to any listing/posting where this product is sold.<br /><br />I'm actually surprised that this information is not readily available. A few friends told me that they will never order any food product without first seeing this information. Which means everyone is losing sales when a product like this is offered without the details. Plus, lots of folks might miss out on what many say is an incredibly tasty and versatile jam!

review/summary: Innovative, But Too Sweet
review/text: I liked the idea of adding smoked bacon flavor to food, so I decided to try this concoction.  It does contain smoked bacon (pork, water, salt sugar, nitrites and smoke), onion, balsamic binegar and brown sugar (sugar, invert sugar, cane molasses) saalt, black pepper.<br /><br />While it does impart a smoked bacon flavor to foods (scrambled eggs I tried, for example) I found the jam way too sweet for my taste...read the ingredients again to see how much sugar is added.  When I think of smoked bacon I think of bacon flavor predominating, with a moderate dose of smoke, and definitely salty, not with sweet overtones.<br /><br />Note that the shelf life of the 3 jars that I bought is only 2 months.....directions say to use or freeze.  And you need to refrigerate the product while it is being consumed.<br /><br />So if you like sweet smoky bacon flavor go for it, but I prefer a saltier version.

review/summary: Damaged jar, but that's ok...It's Bacon!
review/text: Received the 3 pack of bacon goodness and one of the jars had a decent sized hole in it.  Bacon jam was inside the bag that the three jars were shipped in.  Probably would have been a good idea to ship the three jars with some kind of protection in between each jar.  Just putting them in a bag doesn't sound like safe travel.<br /><br />Regardless, I immediately contacted the seller and they sent an email back with in 10 minutes saying they would be glad to send out a new jar.  They didn't request that I send back the damaged one and didn't even ask for a photo of the damage.  Just took my word.  Pretty cool!<br /><br />With in 5 minutes of that email, I received another email saying that a replacement package had been shipped.  Now that's service!  Great job!  I wish all sellers were like that.  I may stop purchasing food products online.  Damage like this has happend before and many sellers don't offer returns.<br /><br />Other than that, the bacon spread is great!  What's not to love about anything BACON?!

review/text: I got this on Woot, Amazon's sister site. They were a lot less for three different varieties...or two. Next time it comes up on Woot, I'm there. Now I might put it in eggs or on grilled cheese or even on the occasional hamburger. It is really just so rich and spicy and yum. I ate it in little spoonfuls at a time till it was all gone. Wrong, I know, but as a mostly low carb eater, I had to atone for the carbs in the jam by not eating it on starch. The eggs idea is brilliant, though...seems silly not to have thought of it.

review/summary: Tasted like rancid Bacon Dripping
review/text: What I received did not taste good at all. I saw this on the food network with high hopes as I love everything pork and bacon is at the top of the list. I was shocked that I did not like it. It had a very funny aftertaste that reminds me of bacon drippings that have been saved in a can and not refrigerated. One other reviewer said they received theirs in a cold pack. Mine did not come that way, it came in a regular box with paper around it but no cold packs. Maybe the 3 jars I received had gone bad but I have no way of knowing. What I received and tasted could not be what all these other 5 star reviewers receieved. I may order another batch later on after the sting of this purchase is gone and will update this review if it is different then what I received this time. All I can say is beware that it appears it might go bad very easily.

review/summary: OVERPRICED -- Tasty, but really overpriced
review/text: For those who are tempted to spend the $14 or so (per 7 oz jar) of this stuff, let me save you the money.<br /><br />We bought a jar at Costco (same $$)  because it just sounded soooooo yummy.  And it IS tasty, but we don't think it worth the price.<br /><br />Basically, it seems like you can make your own by frying some diced real bacon to a medium crisp --keep the melted fat.  Then make a batch of caramelized onions (see the first part of Julia Child's French Onion Soup recipe)  and add a spoon or two of brown sugar.  Throw it all (fat, too) in a blender, add a splash of Balsamic vinegar, blend to a paste.  That pretty much approximates the flavor of this product.  You can doctor it as you like.<br /><br />When we finish this jar, that'll be it.  I'd rather spend the $$ on Umami Paste or something.<br /><br />The cleaned, empty jar is a good size/shape for leftover paint. (Waste not. . .)

review/summary: Best canned tuna out there
review/text: Unless you're a health nut, tuna in olive oil is almost always preferable to that in water. And Genova is the best of the normally priced ones. (there are some super-expensive imported brands in a jar, but they cost as much as fresh tuna) For a quick meal, I like to open a can over a salad mix, complete with the oil, then add some fresh lemon juice, salt and pepper and that's it! A quick, delicious healthy meal.

review/summary: *NOT* made in Italy any more, but in THAILAND (UNFORTUNATELY you CAN taste the difference)
review/text: I bought this product three times. The first two times I got the "made in Italy" version, and it was among the best canned tuna I had ever had (truly Italian standards - I'm from there and I know what I'm talking about). The last batch I got was the "made in Thailand" version (even though at the time the Amazon description still said "made in Italy") and it was just above mediocre. Pretty tasteless actually, and NOTHING compared to the Italian version. Same price though, which made me feel I had just been ripped off (and scammed, since the Amazon description had not been changed by then). NO MORE!

Tonno Genova is preserved in olive oil like in the mediterranean regions of Europe, and I got a 24-pack for $25.<br /><br />Bottom line is: this is not the best that you can get, but it's definitely the best for the price.

review/summary: Not the tuna it once was
review/text: I have been buying Genova Tonno Solid Light Tuna In Olive Oil (5 ounce) for years it was always good and dependable with the exception of an occasional can being somewhat saltier but still good. In the last six months(July-Dec 2010) the quality has declined significantly. I thought that perhaps I bought a bad can or so and I foolishly continued to buy Genova Tonno hoping that possibly it was just a change in processing or suppliers and that I could once again buy Genova with the confidence that it was a quality tuna. The best by dates on the cans is 2014.The Genova Tonno of the last six months can only be described as dry and tasteless.I will NOT be buying Genova Tonno it has gone from what I considered the best tuna to the absolute worst tuna.

review/text: I ordered this tuna from Amazon about one year ago for the first time and I fell in love with it!! Sure, it was a considerably more expensive than the average supermarket brand tuna, but oh my god the flavor was unmatched! Unfortunately it seems that things have changed. Beware customers, Amazon is lying to you, this is NOT ITALIAN TUNA ANYMORE. The label clearly says product of Thailand. And yes, you can definitely taste the difference. Sadly this is not the top quality tuna it was before. The olive oil too seems to be watered down a bit. Shame on Amazon for telling lies and shame on the company for taking away what was the best tuna on the market.

review/summary: Genova Tuna - excellent product, free shipping seals the deal
review/text: If you like tuna in oil, you will enjoy this product. Excellent taste, appearance and texture. Keep in mind that not all 'tuna in oil' is in olive oil - this one is. It is sooooo good that many folks will not need to add mayonnaise, thereby saving calories. Free Prime shipping was enough to seal the deal, as this item is heavy. Shipping from Peapod would have cost almost as much as the tuna. Delivered Amazon cost was only about $1.00 per can. We supply lunch to our employess - even if each person eats two cans, this is a bargain compared to the local deli, which charges around $7.00 for a sandwich. All considered, this is a winner and we have reordered several times.

review/summary: Picky about my tuna -- this is the best!
review/text: I ordered the 3-oz cans of Chicken of the Sea Genova Tonno (tuna), pack of 24.  These are the smaller cans of tuna (single-serving for me).<br /><br />Until I tried these, I would only eat solid white albacore tuna (in spring water).  I've tried all the major brands, from Bumblebee to Starkist to Chicken of the Sea.  In my opinion, something has changed over the past few years to these major brands.  The solid white albacore I had been buying was often "mushy" and inconsistent in quality.<br /><br />After reading the reviews on the Chicken of the Sea Genova Tonno (tuna), I was skeptical, but willing to give it a try.  Since the product wasn't "solid white albacore" tuna, and was packed in oil (olive oil), I had a few lingering doubts.  However, at the time of my purchase, the item was on sale and there was a Chicken of the Sea promotion that lowered the price.  That was enough incentive for me to make my purchase (good move, Amazon!).<br /><br />I tried my first can the day after receiving the product, and I've enjoyed several cans since then.  THIS is how tuna is supposed to be -- how it USED to be.  It flakes beautifully; every can I've opened has had the same quality consistency with NO "mushiness".  The flavor is excellent, in my opinion.  I never thought I would enjoy "non-albacore" tuna, and now I don't think I'll ever go back.

review/summary: Best tuna I've had in a long time!
review/text: Like the other reviews here, I agree that this is the best canned tuna I've had since childhood, when tuna in oil was the only way you could buy it.<br /><br />The fish is moist and flakey, and when mixing for tuna salad, doesn't require much mayo to make a nice mix.  The small cans are nice to pack for lunch, but I'd prefer larger cans since I usually make enough for myself and my husband at the same time.<br /><br />I normally never eat any canned tuna other than white chunk albacore, so to take a shot in the dark and purchase solid light tuna took a leap of faith.  But since the reviews were so glowing, I took a chance and I'm really glad I did!<br /><br />I really hope Amazon gets more of this product back in stock.  I went to order more today and was sad to see I couldn't , especially since they've got 20% off on Chicken of the Sea products until the end of the month.  Maybe they'll get the larger cans in stock too this time?  I'm hoping!

review/summary: NOT MADE IN ITALY, IT'S MADE IN THAILAND!
review/text: First off...the false advertisement states 'made in Italy'...this product is """MADE IN THAILAND!"""  Shame on you, Amazon, for not changing the description when others have posted this same concern in their reviews. I should have listened to the reviewers but thought by now Amazon would have fixed the error!  Instead of Mediterranean Tuna we are buying Tuna that hasn't seen the Mediterranean Sea but instead the South Sea.  I am very curious as to how this changes the toxic, heavy metal counts as Italy has a high ethic standard to packaging food with the Made In Italy statement vs other countries...Thailand for one.<br /><br />As for the taste, it's tuna packed in olive oil which, to me, tastes better than water-packed.  I've never bought it pre-Thailand (actually Made in Italy)so can't compare if it's changed.  It's a good tuna, my cats love it, and I will use it...but will be very concerned how many contaminants I'm eating along with the seafood :(<br /><br />Just be aware of what you are buying BEFORE you order this if it makes a difference to you!<br /><br />ETA:  THANK YOU, AMAZON, FOR ADDING 'MADE IN THAILAND' in the description!<br /><br />After quite a few cans of this tuna, it is still good tasting and a perfect individual size.

review/summary: Not Nearly As Good As It Was
review/text: I received my most recent order of this item today, and am very disappointed that the can from Thailand is only a pop-top; the cans from Italy could be opened with a regular can opener, although a so-called "easy open" tab was also supplied.  The reason I have purchased the Genova from Italy many times is because I could use a can opener, having once sliced my hand very badly trying to open a can of Starkist tuna with a pop-top.  Even though I bought a special opener for these pop-tops, they are extremely hard for me to open, and had I known that the supplier is now in Thailand instead of Italy as I expected, I wouldn't have taken a chance on the can being changed and not ordered it (long ago I got the Genova from Italy in an Italian deli in Santa Monica, California, so knew I could use a regular can opener on them).  I did manage to get one can open from this new shipment, and the contents are very different also from my previous orders.  There is a huge amount of oil, instead of just a small amount, and the tuna is a different color and texture.  The oil and tuna are tastless compared to what I had so many times before from Italy.

review/text: This is a full flavored but not overpowering Tuna.  It works in cooked dishes without losing flavor and Sandwiches are really good also.  I used it both drained and not drained.  I like it best undrained.  This surprised me as I originally thought it would be too oily.  Not so, and the flavor is enhanced.  REally surprised as aI did not think an American made Italian style tuna could be as good as the Italian made.

review/summary: Genova Tonno Tuna
review/text: Perfect size for brown bagging.  It may be small, but you still get big chunks of tuna, not that mushy stuff sold in grocery stores.  It is packed in olive oil, not water - I never liked the water packed tuna.  Genova Tonno Tuna is a staple of my workday lunch.

review/text: My wife and I took a trip to Europe and she fell in love with Tuna in olive oil.When we got back home, there were not many places to find it and if we did it was really expensive. We found this Genova tuna online and ordered right away. It was at our house within 2 days and ended up costing about the same price as a regular can of tuna at the store. This is a great deal!

review/summary: Would Be Excellent, But For One Thing...
review/text: This would be excellent canned tuna except for one thing.  It is TOO SALTY!!!  It is, by far, the best tuna we've had in many decades.  We can't believe how good it is.  Actual big chunks of flavorful tuna accentuated by the subtle, yet present, flavor of the olive oil.  Unbelievably good, but simply much, much too salty!  The saltiness hits your tongue after the exquisite taste of the tuna/olive oil and drowns out that taste.  What was Chicken of the Sea thinking???  Why would they try to ruin an exceptionally excellent product with far too much salt?  Frankly, we are disgusted with the amount of salt the food industry tries to force upon us instead of allowing us to savor the true taste of our food.  (As you know, too much salt is bad for your health, as well.)  This quality product does not deserve to be drowned in salt.  The pop-top cans on this 3-ounce size are a little hard to open, but the nice thing is that there are NO sharp edges left on top or can after opening (unlike most of this style top).  This size serving is a nice addition to a lunch box or to top a salad or rice with.  If you don't mind the salt, this is one excellent product.  We will buy this again, but not in the quantities we would, if it were less salty.  We want to limit our salt intake and this product would be, oh so much, better with less of it.  Hope this helps you decide!

review/summary: Tasty Tuna
review/text: This tuna has excellent flavor, and I keep several cans at work and at home. It's perfect for lunch or a snack, in a salad or by itself.  It is sooo much tastier than dry, water packed tuna.  I do prefer the larger 5 ounce cans that require a can opener, and wish they were available on subscribe and save.  As conveniect as the little pull tab cans are, they are so small that it's hard to get good leverage to open them.  I have fairly large hands for a woman.  Maybe someone with smaller hands would do better with the tiny cans.<br /><br />I give 5 stars to the tuna, but 3 or less to the can, which is why I gave it a 4, not a 5 rating.

review/summary: Sorry, Charlie
review/text: Given the choice, I'd eat tuna packed in olive oil pretty much every day. Alas, mercury levels say it is not to be. Still, with a few crackers it makes an excellent lunch to keep in case of emergency at the office. Add half an avocado if you're feeling extra-festive. Don't keep that part at the office, though. Also excellent over pasta, perhaps with some lemon and capers or a few olives.<br /><br />This tuna is just salty enough to be tasty with nothing added, moist, and most cans consist of fairly large chunks. Some cans have smaller, shreddier bits, but on the whole it's of excellent quality.<br /><br />I had consistently purchased the Genova brand at local shops, but with Subscribe and Save, Amazon offers a better price. And you definitely can't beat the convenience.

review/summary: Excellent product, excellent price
review/text: Perfect smaller size for lunch. Generous serving if being used on regular sized bread for a tuna sandwich. I like to put it on top of a simple spinach salad or roll it up inside lettuce leaves for a fast, healthy meal. Really great taste, far better than the Starkist I used to eat before I found this -- and cheaper per ounce too! The taste is a little more salty than usual for canned tuna, but I like that. Of the four people in my household, two us like this tuna better and two of us don't calling it too salty. There is minimal olive oil in the can but as I always squeeze out the excess oil, letting it pour down the sink before taking out the tuna, I like the less oil too. I used 'subscribe and save' and this will be the tuna I eat from now on (unless the price increases dramatically). It's nice to have pantry staples delivered to my door on a regular basis, thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Genova Tonno is a good Buy
review/text: There was actually more usable chunk tuna in one 3 oz. Tin of Genova than a 6oz Tin of Star Kist tuna, which was shredded and shrank down to about 1/3rd weight after draining the water. With the 6oz. can of "XXX" I only had enough to make � sandwich but the mayo and onions tasted good.<br />I made a tuna salad sandwich with Genova, green onions and celery with mayo on an onion bun. You will not need to add salt. I just drained the oil from the can and mixed it with the ingredients.<br />I intend to use this with a green salad mix or even pasta.<br /><br />Although I do like salt, next time I may try rinsing the tuna in a colander but not pressing it. With some of the shredded stuff you may just end up with a spoon-full.<br />For quick meals, I used to like Hot-Dogs but not any more. The taste of this yellow-fin tuna is quite good, actually much better than I had expected. Some of the tuna you get from the local grocery store may look like cat food when you open it up. This definitely does not.<br />I will buy it again because you can't beat the Amazon price with Free Shipping.

review/summary: Tastes Great - Costs Less
review/text: I like to have small cans of tuna around for a somewhat healthy an afternoon snack at work.  The "line caught" albacore products are superb -- I have bought them here on Amazon and on various websites including some maintained by the fishermen themselves.  Great stuff, but much as I want to support this kind of fishing and eat those products, it is just too costly for me to do so on a regular basis.  In looking for alternatives, I tried the Tonno light tuna in olive oil.  Obviously, Amazon's cost, especially with free shipping, is hard to beat.  As importantly, this is really a delicious product.  Nice look and texture and tastes good (right out of the can).  I am very happy with this and recommend it, especially at the current price of less than $30 for 24 cans!

review/summary: Used to be excellent product, now watered down, I'll tell you why
review/text: Having worked in the canned seafood industry, I sampled this product at work for consistency, quality, and taste. It was EXCELLENT back in 2007. I soon relied on this product for lunch (with Ritz crackers, Genova Tonno was very, very good) and also sometimes for snacks. I'd buy them in bulk here on Amazon at reasonable prices.<br /><br />Having worked with canned tuna, I can tell you the prices of the "commodity" have gone way up across the board for light tuna (e.g. skipjack) and white tuna (e.g. albacore). This is due to increased fishing cost and decreased supply of fish. As sad of an issue as overfishing due to the trawling methods, the reality is we're seeing this reflected in the cost and quality of various seafood products, most notably via the traditional 6oz cans being downsized to 5oz first by Starkist followed by other shelf stable seafood manufacturers.<br /><br />So this Genova Tonno product USED TO BE chunks of tuna in extra virgin olive oil with a nice balanced amount of salt. However, this product is now watery chunky tuna that has a bit of olive oil in it. And in case you didn't know, Genova is owned by Chicken of the Sea, who is actually owned by a Thai based company called Thai Union, which has its own packing facilities in Thailand. THIS IS NOT ITALIAN TUNA, do not let the name fool you. It is Italian-style, and like most of Chicken of the Sea products, Genova Tonno is packed in Thailand. Genova products are still very good and of a decent quality, but it just is not what it used to be because of the rising costs.<br /><br />Given the higher prices of this product, I no longer recommend this due to the $2+ per 3oz can price tag. This used to make for a relatively healthy, affordable and delicious lunch or snack, but it is now not a very good value. I recommend other alternatives (skip the pre-made canned tuna spread, it's got too much mayo and salt in it). Or consider making your own Tonno/olive oil tuna. Just try and look for "natural" tuna if you can since trusted brands' old fashioned canned tuna in water contains vegetable broth/hydrolized protein that is injected to allow the fish to soak up more water (industry's dirty little secret). There are plenty of fast and easy to prepare tuna/salmon options online if you look close hard enough on Amazon...

review/summary: Best Tuna in Olive Oil for the Price
review/text: Without question, the best readily available canned tuna in olive oil for the price.  Once you've eaten tuna in olive oil, you'll never to back to the wretched catfood that's referred to as tuna packed in water.  It's good enough to eat out of the can, and great with capers and chopped onion on a salad.<br /><br />BTW, those posters who complain that that Genova was at one time Italian sourced tuna are misinformed.  "Genova" is simply the trade name used by Chicken of the Sea for its Yellowfin tuna packed in olive oil (packing in olive oil is the traditional method of preservation for Mediterranean caught tuna).  It was once canned in American Samoa, but is now processed in Thailand.  It has never been Italian sourced.

review/summary: wonderful tuna
review/text: I normally buy top quality tuna packed in water from Amazon to avoid the genetically modified soy found in the water packed tuna in the grocery stores.  I also avoid tuna packed in genetically modified cottonseed oil and/or soy oil.<br /><br />This is the first time I've been willing to pay extra for tuna packed in olive oil so I can't compare this brand of tuna in olive oil to the really expensive ones.  It does not specify extra virgin olive oil and I noticed that the oil was quite light in color, but - trusting that it is actually olive oil and not canola sneaked in dishonestly - the flavor was very good.<br /><br />This is delicious, really meaty tuna.  It is packed solid with no "little fish flakes" in the can.  All I had to do was chop celery really fine and add a bit of fresh lemon juice and it was as good as - or better than - the tuna salad I make with all kinds of other things in it.<br /><br />The only criticism is that quite a few of the cans were dented, but not enough to make them unusable. This has been a problem with other canned goods ordered from Amazon.  However, to be fair, there are a lot of dented cans of everything on the shelves in my local supermarkets, so I don't think it is necessary an "Amazon problem".<br /><br />For a really fast, healthy and delicious meal for one, this tuna is terrific.  I will be ordering it again, for sure.

review/summary: good for the price
review/text: I like this coffee. It is definitely not my all time favorite but it is good for the price. It is a bit bitter compared to other types of coffee but I like it enough to try a different one from  this seller.

review/summary: Pretty good for a side when you're in a pinch
review/text: My husband and I use these when we don't want to cook a side.<br /><br />They have so much oil though that I feel guilty throwing it out after we're done. I have saved the oil before and put it into a salad with balsamic vinegar the next day.

review/summary: at last in this famine a food worthy of human consumption
review/text: And we find her here upon this grand amazon!<br /><br />Each day Morinu feeds me like my own nourishing mother, cherishes and consents my whims with this wonderful food.<br /><br />Eschew all animal byproducts and cadavers.<br /><br />This tofu is a strengthening food, fit for human consumption.<br /><br />And so convenient from our mighty amazon, sent right to your front porch or, in my case, post office box with free shipping rather than driving thirty to seventy five miles for the same product at three times the price, plus gas.<br /><br />This is fit food for humans, food for which our bodies are created, food which feeds us rather than kills both the source and the consumer.<br /><br />You may read here written by the self-deceived that this tofu is too mushy for firmness and that it must be pressed between towels before cooking. To them so confused I ask<br /><br />Cooking?<br /><br />Each day at least once a day, I draw forth my serrated knife, and one sacrificial box of this excellent tofu, and I without remorse slice a hole in its top, with great tenderness and care and gratitude, releasing only the slightest and most apologetic gentle spurt of clearest liquid.<br /><br />And this with a certain yearning.<br /><br />I do not observe the indications written sternly upon the short edge of the box, but lie this box gently down upon a smooth flat slab of wood, with the face up, and take the knife very gently sliding upon on edge of the top, the very belly of the box, and then upon the other edge of this top, and then most gently along the bottom edge of this top, each time releasing apologetically the slightest hint of a clear liquid, revealing thusly by means of these three slits the gentle hidden secrets of the box, the soft white substance lying shyly within, awaiting with embarrassment our further processing.<br /><br />I feel the need to explain this procedure with greater care and attention. The very tip, the point of the knife, uncovers tenderly a certain point a certain distance from the corner of the broad top of the box, the side with the picture and product label, as pictured here, the side which reads Morinu, the broad flat side laid flat. The very tip of the knife, I say, discovers probingly a certain point near one corner which offers the proper resistance without too great a resistance, without too little a resistance, to penetrate this membrane. Too close to the corner is found to be too hard, too resistant, too unwilling, although most convenient for the later proceedings. Too distant from the corner implies simply random slashings without specific purpose, and our purpose in this procedure is most serious, most purposeful, intent.<br /><br />In a word therefore the point of the knife penetrates the membrane slowly yet purposefully as close to the corner as possible, penetrating as deeply as possible without piercing the wooden slab beneath. A certain spurt of clear liquid may emerge, but let this prove no inhibition, as the knife reaches the depth of the box. Slowly withdraw the knife, slowly, at a diagonal, allowing the serration softly with friction to continue to separate a slight slit along the ege of the box, slowly, resolutely but patiently, with purpose, as the serration creates an ever longer slit along that edge, as closely as possible.<br /><br />Continue from this first slit along the the contiguous edge of the top of this box, and then the third edge, inserting carefully your knife, and slowly withdrawing with a friction sufficient to separate the membrane without shredding, without eliciting over muchly the clear liquid which may spurt forth.<br /><br />Let us call the top right corner of the box Point A, the bottom right corner Point B, the left bottom corner Point C and the upper left corner Point D. Begin to pierce at Point A, proceed in turn to B, to C, ending at D, forming this a slit along the three edges. Arriving at Point D, withdraw the knife completely, wipe the blade with a soft, dry cloth and set it aside for cleansing. We now may lift the flap thus created, exposing the delicate white contents within.<br /><br />I feel remiss if I do not address a probable misconception here writtenonly for the rhetorical convenience, and I feel compelled by the necesity of correcting this counter-indication, no matter how unclear this may be, due only to my severely limiting literary incapacities.<br /><br />Employing the same alphabetical coordinates as described above, the consumer may discover this procedure far more efficacious: to begin at Point A and proceed gently yet firmly to point B as described. Divergently, however, please proceed to point D (!) and then directly by knife edge to point C, parallel to the Line AB already created, yet along the opposing edge. Having thusly formed two parallel slits, find the midpoint between Point B and Point C as close to the edge as possible, probing and then plunging the tip of the knife through the cardboard membrane, through to the bottom of the box, but now with an orientation perpendicular to that previously used in the formation of lines AB and DC. Withdraw slowly, delicately, yet with sufficient friction at an angle to proceed effectively to the corner at Point B. Withdraw completely and reverse the knife blade, returning it deeply at the midpoint previously entered. Withdraw once more with similar care, and opposite diagonal, completing the slit thus formed entirely to Point C. I am confident the consumer may discover this procedure far more delightful and effective than any here previously described.<br /><br />Firmly we roll back the top flap created by the three slits. Proceed mercilessly, proceed, not frenetically, but ardently nevertheless, to dice within the selfsame box her contents, slowly, gently, but decisively. The fresh tip of my serrated knife, which in recent memory has touched no animal part, but vegetable alone, and never shall become so adulterate with the blood of the animal, with the dairy of the animal, this sanctified and reserved and faithful tip, having never known in any sense animal but only vegetable, purified thus, unadulterate, this sacred knife dares therefore pierce this gentle pure white tofu into a ruthless grid of slits, fully through to the bottom box, plunging first vertically in rhythmically repeated rows spaced gently a few centimeters apart, and then, relentlessly, horizontally, pushing ever so softly through the yielding, unresisting white tofu laid back upon the flat slab, awaiting without a word this process, with utter patience, yielding.<br /><br />Completed this repeated slicing, back and forth, up and down, across, and through, and through, I lift in one hand upwards the entire box gently, yet unrelentingly, over the recipient reserved for this purpose alone. Most often it is the daily lunch container, reusable, with soft top, to receive the more securely and gently this daily offering, removed demurely from its box, as cautiously as a hermit crab from its borrowed shell, vulnerable by exposure. With one finger one may remove whatever residue remains relunctly within the package, passing it reassuringly into the ultimate recipient.<br /><br />Lime juice freshly squeezed upon the tofu deposited there, as ablution, meets fragrant sprigs of fresh green cilantro mated with whole Corriander Seeds 7oz, and a generous ladling of the Eden Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12) also available upon this generously nutrient amazon. This is a meal in itself, and comes most welcome at noon.<br /><br />At night rather than such a cold lunch, in this cold winter a warmer meal is wanted, and so this gentle and yielding box of nutritious tofu might discover herself pushed gently into a saucepan of simmering miso soup, such as, perhaps, Shiro Miso Paste NON GMO No MSG Added. This miso soup would take far greater space to describe here in the making. From this container of miso paste draw forth a goodly spoonful to introduce slowly, most politely, into a gently heating small saucepan of water. Later, in place of seaweed and to deceive my own palate, I place those small flat spinach leaves available in the organic department of your local market, perhaps with the results of a small onion diced very carefully in the manner approved as described above, or green onion.<br /><br />When quite ready for dinner, I add last of all to this essence this gentle box of tofu, sliced as described above, with great and tender care, leaving it bathing one might dare say, only long enough to warm through and through, before eating.<br /><br />A veritable meal in itself.<br /><br />There are so many other manners in which to use, and to abuse, this pure, white and utterly nutritious gentle product, and I can only with my utmost recommendation say, and this with my greatest gratitude, that here at long last we may know a food most willingly fit for our human consumption, and one most readily available upon this wonderful amazon.<br /><br />Great shelf life in this packaging, patiently awaiting your most tender mercies and privileged attentions, but out here in this desert I still keep it in the fridge!

review/text: I read a lot of reviews before I ordered this.  I ordered it yesterday afternoon (10-10-12) it arrived around 9:30 today (10-11-12)!!!  Totally amazed at the speed of delivery.  Even more amazing is the taste of this.  You totally can not tell it is sugar free and the dark chocolate flavor is spot on.  It is really really good in hot coffee - I can't wait to try it in iced coffee!  Thanks Monin and Amazon!  PS: our office staff loves it too, I think I better order another six pack while I am online ;)

review/summary: Excellent snack
review/text: I planned on going for a hike in the mountains while on vacation so my wife picked up some snacks for me. These were one of those snacks. I was surprised at how good and addicting they are. They seem to be the only flavor out of stock every time I visit the store so that's why I ordered them from Amazon. There are several flavors but the tropical is the best. Reminds me of my hike every time I have a package.

review/text: As soon as I received notification that this was available I immediately ordered it. I have only been able to find this product in a CVS 40 minutes from where I live (I wasn't really checking every store locally). I love the taste of the coconut bits and mango pieces. I keep some at work, take some on trips and always have a pack in my purse. Can't wait for them to be available again!

review/summary: Mmmmm... Really, really chocolate!
review/text: I've been gluten free for about 4 years and I've really missed chocolate cake.  No matter what I've tried it's gritty or just doesn't have a deep and satisfying taste.  I picked this up at a natural food store, always willing to try something new if it's chocolate.<br /><br />WOW!  I made cupcakes, and frosted them with dark chocoate frosting.  Unbelievably good!  The first time I made these I forgot to add the water, they turned out like a rich chocolate brownie (that's okay too!).  They are full of flavor, have just the right amount of sweetness and do not taste like a typical gluten free product.  This is priceyer than other GF mixes but trust me, worth every penny!!

review/text: I was very pleased with the quickness of delivery of this product.  The product was just as we expected with Brach's mints that we have purchased for years.  They are the best. They need to change the packaging from the twist ends to the pressed for ease of taking them out of the package.  The only problem is that it was made in Mexico and not the USA.
