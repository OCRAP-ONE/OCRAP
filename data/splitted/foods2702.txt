review/summary: My cat loves it
review/text: I was a little worried my cat might not like this food after reading some of the reviews. I bought the Turkey and Salmon Formula and this is the best purchase I have made for my cat so far. He really enjoys the food and finishes it almost instantly after I give it to him. I guess you have to decide to buy this stuff on a cat by cat basis, but I'm very happy with my purchase.

review/summary: Great kitten food
review/text: My kitten is 8 months old and we've seen such a change in his coat since switching to this brand of food. Previously we fed him the Fancy Feast kitten food and he liked it but after reading horror stories about the ingredients in most commercial cat foods we decided to switch to something more natural. He loves this one too and as previsouly mentioned, we've seen such a change in his fur - softer and much shinier.

review/summary: Cat loves it, good protein content, good ingredients, good brand
review/text: Used to feed my cat Natural Balance pouches exclusively, cat loved them, but these have higher protein (10% vs 8%) and what looks like better ingredients. My cat won't eat patte' style cat food, only sliced like this. He loves it - gets very excited and snarfs it down - and has no stomach trouble with them at all. Priced pretty reasonably (as 'premium' wet food goes), cat loves it - ingredients are really good - and Wellness is a solid company. Good stuff.

review/summary: Diarrhea 2 for 2
review/text: Gone through only four cans and it looks like I'm going to have to trash the remaining 20.  Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction.  One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day.  I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress. From now on I'll be buying individual cans at the pet store first before I jump the gun and buy a whole case online.

review/text: We just adopted our two year old cat and have been testing out different wet and dry foods. I got Wellness Salmon and Wellness Beef and Chicken and the Beef and Chicken was the winner. We judged this based on the following: Cole ate the Beef and Chicken in about 20 seconds and licked the bowl clean. Hasn't happened with any other food! We also recommend the Wellness dry food. This cat food is expensive though compared to others but if I don't eat crappy processed food why expect my cat to?

review/text: Love Wellness canned food.  I've done a lot of pet food research, and I've come down to Wellness canned (grain free non-Core varieties only) being the best. It's grade A food, that is actually MADE IN THE USA!!!  You'd be surprised how hard this is to find (e.g. Weruva is made in Thailand).  I only wish they didn't use BPA in their cans.  My cats loved the turkey flavor for a very long time.  However, as with all foods, they got sick of it eventually.  So now I rotate between Turkey & Salmon, Chicken & Herring, and Chicken and Beef.

review/summary: Inconsistent quality
review/text: When I first started ordering this product on Amazon I received damaged cans - every single can on the wrapped pallet of twelve cans was dented so I know it didn't happen during shipping.  The food was also dry so I stopped ordering the product after receiving two shipments of poor quality product.  After getting reminder notices to reorder I decided to give it another try a few months later.  The quality was excellent and the food was really moist and fresh - perfect, my cats loved it!  After receiving about four good quality product shipments, the fifth one that I currently received is back to being dry and chunky instead of moist and creamy and my cats won't eat it.  How can the product be that inconsistent???  Very disappointed.

review/text: All of my cats LOVE the Wellness canned foods ... and I love the ingredients and quality.  The turkey flavor is in my cats' top 3 favorite canned foods.  When Amazon offered Super Saver Shipping on Wellness, it was practically the only thing I would buy because the price made it a no-brainer.  I've had to branch out some since it has become more difficult to find online (and I can't buy it locally in my remote location), but I still get it whenever I can.

review/text: Wellness cat food has a great reputation. I have 5 cats and it's hard to please all of them, but I find all of them eat this food.  I know it's a tad more expensive, but I feel good knowing that they are getting a good food - good tasting and good for them, too.  AND I do feel it makes a difference with their coat and skin. The delivery was shockingly fast - and reason cost.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Not to my cat's taste- but adding warm water helped
review/text: I purchased this cat food after reading glowing recommendations from two or three different cat nutrition websites. One site did offer the caveat that while the quality of this brand was excellent it would not help the cat's diet if he refused to eat it and the reviewer's experience was that some cats would love it and others wouldn't touch it. My cat was somewhere in the middle - he didn't love it, but he would sometimes leave it half-eaten and the rest would dry up.<br /><br />My 8 year old cat is new to canned food - he has been fed a diet of 99.5 percent dry food since we adopted him as a half-grown kitten. (The other .5 percent he obtained himself from ferns and the occasional mouse. After reading an article about the nutritional needs of cats, I discovered that our rotund feline was getting too many carbohydrates and not enough protein, and I began adding canned cat food along side his daily bowl of dry food. I have tried a few different brands to find something that suits him.<br /><br />The Wellness canned cat food (I purchased the chicken and herring formula)has a pate-texture and I think this was my pet's primary objection to it. After trying several different canned foods, I find that he prefers more of a filet in gravy style preparation.<br /><br />When I first gave this to my cat I simply plopped the chunk of food into his bowl - leaving it largely in a solid can-shaped blob. Later, I began to add a half-can of warm water to the bowl and mix it up to make a thinner mush. Using this method, he seems to do fine with it, so I may or may not purchase it again.

review/summary: Completely worth the price.
review/text: Is Wellness relatively expensive? Yes. Is it worth every penny? ABSOLUTELY, yes.<br /><br />As new cat owners, my husband and I wanted to make sure our two newly adopted cats would get the best care possible. After spending hours researching pet foods on the internet, I was completely shocked (and disgusted!) to find out how terrible the cheap grocery store brands of food really are. It didn't take long for us to settle on Wellness because of its premium ingredients and stellar reputation.<br /><br />Thankfully, our cats LOVE this food. They're happy, and we're happy because it's so good for them! We gladly spend the extra money to ensure the health and well being of our two furry children. They love the turkey, chicken, and turkey/salmon varieties, which are all grain free. Turkey is their favorite, which is why I'm posting the review here. :)<br /><br />If you want your cats to eat great food, try Wellness. We are SO glad we did!

review/summary: Pricey, but well worth it
review/text: There is a feline diabetes epidemic out there.  My cat was self-feeding dry food (Purina Urinary Tract Health) which has a huge proportion of cereal carbs.  When she developed diabetes the vet advised adding Science Prescription Diet DM wet canned foot to augment the dry.  She needed less and less insulin and finally we were told she didn't need it at all. Still letting her self-feed the Purina dry foot while feeding her the wet canned, she had a relapse.  I decided to toss the Purina and just feed her the wet food and she's been fine for almost a year now.  I'm hoping she'll remain diabetes-free for the rest of her life.<br /><br />The Wellness food, labeled "Core," is very low carb and both my cats love it!  It contains a lot of water ("no more than 78%" is what the label says -- kinda expensive way to keep your cats in water ;)<br /><br />I justify the expense by accepting that my cat would be needing $100 vials of insulin, plus frequent vet checks of her blood. Instead I'm spending the money on food.<br /><br />As a side note, our other cat without diabetes loves this food, too.  She had urologic problems, was always licking herself, and used to smell really, really bad. She's doing super now and I attribute it to the wet, cereal-free food.<br /><br />I highly recommend working with your vet to wean your cat off dry cereal foods, especially if they're diabetic.  The Wellness canned food is fantastic and might save your kitty's life!

review/text: I feed several Savannah Cats, all of which can be very picky eaters. Everyone wants something different and if I change anything about their diet they get upset stomachs.<br /><br />I bought Wellness food trying to get them all to eat the same thing. I was simply amazed. As I gave it to them one by one they loved it. Even my 2 biggest picky eaters ate it right up. I watched closely for any upset stomachs and nothing. They all accepted the food with no issues.<br /><br />I was a little worried at first as to how much they ate as it could be expensive, but within a few days they leveled themselves out. I am just thrilled with the food and their reactions. I will promote this food to all my new homes. The food smells good enough to eat. Hum, wonder how my husband would like to try a new dish tonight :)

review/summary: Great Option For Diabetic Cats!
review/text: My 14 year-old cat was diagnosed with Diabetes and Chronic Renal Failure earlier this year; it was devastating. I had to administer insulin shots to him twice a day and twice he had hypo-glycemia due to the enormous challenge of balancing insulin levels. Worse, he was miserable and wary of me.<br /><br />At 16 lbs, he was overweight even for a large frame cat so I promptly began an intensive internet research (agree with the earlier poster who cautions against the foods prescribed by vets and sold in grocery stores) and after narrowing the field of high-protein pet foods, decided to try wet food. I was nervous because I had been guilty of feeding my baby delicious, awful-for-him dry foods (I was clueless) so I had no idea how long the transition to Wellness wet would take.<br /><br />There was no transition: He loved the food immediately and the switch was painless. Best, he lost 4 lbs in about 6 months, his blood sugar has stabilized and he's off insulin, hopefully permanently.<br /><br />Wellness isn't cheap, but when compared with the cost of losing a beloved furry member of the family too soon, the price is well-justified!<br /><br />ps. Maximillian's favorites are the chicken and the turkey. Vary for best results!

review/summary: Wellness Grain-Free canned cat food
review/text: When my female cat came down w/pancreatitis a few years ago (to the tune of $1000), I started researching what her diet should include.  My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.  Also, I noticed on the can that corn was an ingredient.  I asked her about this, considering corn is a sugary veggie and she also wanted Gracie to lose about 3-4 lbs.  She told me that the main idea was to have her eat a canned food that was 8% or less in carbohydrates IN A DRY STATE.  That means, they take the food, dry it out and get the true percentages of carbs, etc.<br />When I did some research on the web about pancreatitus in cats, I found that GRAIN in cat food can bring on and/or aggravate the condition. I read many articles that explained that cats DON'T NEED grain in their diet.  Pet food manufacturers put it in there because it sounds good to us, the pet owners, when we read that the food contains brown rice, etc.  But what's good for us, as we all know, isn't always good for them.<br /><br />I looked at many companies that made Grain-Free food and was very impressed w/Wellness.  They have many varieties that are grain-free.  When I called them to get the percentage of carbs in a dry matter basis, they were prepared and quick to answer w/out having to transfer me 10 times.<br />The food is not inexpensive, but my cat REALLY likes it.  This bout w/pancreatitis occured about 4 years ago. She has been on Wellness ever since and is in excellent health. She is now 14 yrs old.<br /><br />I highly endorse this product.  If I get another cat someday, I will feed her grain-free food from kittenhood.<br />BTW, they also make grain-free dry food, but I haven't tried it.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />Allie

review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

review/summary: Awesome Cat Food
review/text: Being new to raising kittens, I have tried a variety of canned foods in recent months.  Although my kittens readily took to the Fancy Feast brand, it is not the most healthy of foods - my biggest concern being the by-product content.  I thought I would never get them off of that kitty krack!  However, MUCH to my surprise, they absolutely love this food and ate it readily the first time.  And the best part is that it is a very healthy food - no grains, no by-products.  There is a little gravy in the bottom of the can so I put a little bit of water in, give it a swirl, put it on top of the food - and whalah - instant broth and MORE water for my babies to lap up which is so vital for avoiding UTI's.<br /><br />I just can't say enough - good - about this product.  Thank you, Wellness.  My kittens are happy and that's all that matters!!!

When the cans were opened, the contents had separated into solid and liquid.  We tried to mix it together again, but the cat refused it.  I email the company and sent a picture along and they said it had been subjected to extreme heat and had cooked in the can.  It wasn't hot locally, so I believe it happened while in Amazon's hands.  Additionally, Amazon has been less then helpful in processing the return.<br /><br />So, buy the food for your cat if it likes it, but just not from Amazon.  Get it from a company that handles food products regularly; they probably know a lot more about keeping products edible.

review/summary: My cat's favorite flavor
review/text: My cat absolutely loves this flavor. Normally, I have to coax her to finish her food, but when I give her a serving of Chicken & Herring, the bowl is clean in like five minutes. I do not understand why some of the other reviewers blamed the company for selling them bad cans--their cats probably just prefer another flavor. I say experiment to see what your cat will eat, and stay away from cat food with grains in it!

review/text: She LOVES this food.  Licks her bowl clean.  I think it's a very quality product. Canned food was recommended for her by our veterinarian (who only sees cats). . . who said it's closer to what they would "naturally" eat.  It makes me wonder if Wellness should consider "Mouse" flavor along with Turkey and Salmon!

review/summary: My cats now love it!
review/text: I have two cats, one under 1 year old and the other is 4 years old. After researching about proper cat diets, I realized that they needed a good grain-free meaty canned food. Wellness fit the bill. The younger cat ate up the chicken flavor instantly and loved it! The older cat however, refused to eat it at first. She was used to eating dry kibbles and occasionally canned fancy feast. She kept refusing to eat the Wellness and I caved in and let her finish the bag of kibbles. Only when we didn't have any other food than the canned wellness did she approach it. So once she was good and hungry, and the younger cat was in another room, she crept out and started eating it!! Now she loves it and eats the chicken flavor with no problem. I haven't tried out the other flavors, but since I had such a hard time getting her to come around to eating it in the first place, I've been feeding them both the chicken flavor exclusively. If your cat won't eat Wellness, be patient and get rid of their previous food so when they get hungry they only have one choice. Mixing the old food with the new one wasn't as successful as just waiting it out. Their coats are super shiny and they are both at a healthy weight on a wellness diet.

review/text: I would truly recommend this brand to anyone with a cat. My cat had a ton of problems - from vomitting to diarrhea and really smelly poop. Not only did this solve all those issues, but he now has the most silkiest, softest, shiniest fur. The quantity of food intake has also decreased. No more begging for food every 5 minutes. Another bonus - my cat now has a lean and toned body that I'm envious of.<br />This product will save you a lot of trips to the vet!!!

review/summary: Good, healthy food
review/text: Did some googling on kitten nutrition and found that the food I was feeding my kitten did not have very high water content and that she was supposed to be eating a meat based food (grain is no good for cats).  This food seemed to match well with what google told me, and I've been feeding her this wet food for 2 months now.  She seems to like the food and she looks great.  She seemed pretty healthy before as well, but there was a noticeable difference after I switched her food.  Her coat is shinier and softer, she's more energetic, and has been maintaining a good weight.  I wish it wasn't so expensive, but I think its worth the price and I will keep buying it.

Until tonight he had only eaten Felidae, but when I opened a can of Wellness he went crazy for it! This will definitely be a part of our food rotation.

review/summary: Better than most canned food but still BAD
review/text: I have a cat who had serious intestinal issues. I needed a canned food that was grain free and also I need a protein that was not chicken - I had to start my cat on a novel protein. I bought this on the recommendation of a veterinarian (L. Pierson) on her web site, for so called "acceptable" canned food, because it is grain free. However if you read the ingredients list, it contains other ingredients that the same veterinarian says are allergenic to cats (e.g. carageenan). Also, even though its name claims it is "Turkey", (the turkey was supposed to be the novel protein for me) the ingredients list lists chicken and chicken parts as its 2nd, 3rd and 4th ingredients. It also has the same type of thickeners, fillers, and "flavoring" that all the other run of the mill canned pet food has.<br /><br />I originally gave this a 3 star rating (because it doesn't contain grains), but as I typed my review I was reminded of the deception and it made me change it to a 2 star.

review/summary: Positive for Wellness
review/text: My background is 50 years of dog/cat owner and college degree in chemistry so I'm not completely ignorant about pet nutrition. After a few days of Google research and reading pet food negatives and positives, I decided on a mix of Wellness both wet and the dry exclusively for my two rescue/shelter kitties based on reviews and availability. Price was not a deciding factor. After 1-1/2 years, they still gobble it down and I'm pleased to report both kitties mental and physical health to be outstanding with shiney, smooth coats, regular bowel movements, and healthy, energetic activity. I contribute this good fortune mostly to their diet of Wellness and a loving home environment although my billfold wouldn't mind if it were a bit cheaper. In my experience, Wellness has been outstanding.

Yesterday was the first time we tried the Salmon and Trout flavor, and absolutely none of them would touch it. They left it in their dishes all day and went hungry.<br /><br />I'll still give it 3 stars, because overall Wellness is better than anything else out there. Just be sure to test out the different flavors on your cats before committing to any bulk orders.

This Wellness Canned food is very fresh and (according to the experts) has all the healthy nutrition cats need. I've tried a few different brands and this one gives my cats the best soft, full coat and even makes their poop smell less (super bonus!). It's pricier, but give it a shot.

review/summary: Couldn't eat -- looks like worms or bugs in package
review/text: I have always loved Kashi cereals & Go-Lean bars. But I just bought a box of these bars (expiration 3/26/11) and it had bits hanging off of it -- the way food gets when moths or worms have gotten at it. There was webby, crummy residue inside the inner package (the one holding each pair of bars). I tried to e-mail the company, but its e-mail page just takes you to a FAQ page, in which packaging+worms calls up nothing and it takes you right back to the FAQ pulldown, no option to write my own message, even though the previous page had offered a "send e-mail" option. Very frustrating. I will return this package & am hesitant to eat Kashi in the future.

review/summary: Tastiest of the kashi bar line in my opinion!
review/text: Okay, so most of the kashi items are, in my opinion, hard to compare to other mainstream less healthy options, these however, have almost the exact same texture as the nature valley granola bars. They are definitely crunchy and a bit messy. I actually, for ease of eating purposes, whack my still wrapped/sealed bars against the counter so that the individual pack breaks into smaller/bite size pieces. This makes it easier to eat these, because biting into the bars is a little challenging (yes, they are THAT crunchy!) That being said, the flavor of these bars and the nice contrasting textures of seeds and grains is quite satisfying and delicious. If you like hearty, pumpkin, fall spice type of foods this is definitely for you. I would note however, the extreme crunchiness of these bars may not be conducive to someone who has a hard time chewing, and/or beware, as the grains/seeds have a tendency (not unlike popcorn hulls) to stick in teeth, maybe not great for anyone with dentures/braces. All in all though, these are definitely my favorite of the kashi bars in terms of flavor!

review/summary: excellent quality light but full of flavor -good company
review/text: First I have to say I ordered and tried 5 flavors of the syrups from this company. I was so sick of maple ALL the time. So, as a general statement each flavor was very good, they were light but full of flavor. And though every person has different tastes and will like them in different degrees I found the following to be my tastes:<br /><br />Peach: even though i would not have thought peach would be my fav of the lot it was. it had amazing flavor and was not too super sweet. plus it went awesome w a bit of butter.<br /><br />strawberry: was really really good flavor nothing artificial about it just lightly sweet with great strawberry flavor.<br /><br />marionberry: had great bolder flavor, sweeter than the rest and thicker, closer to traditional pancake syrups but good flavor.<br /><br />red raspberry: i was expecting this to be my favorite and it was really tasty, even if peach did steal the show. however this was good and also light, though it had just a hint of an after taste.<br /><br />cherry; of all i tried this one had the lightest flavor, it was also more liquid like and less syrupy. it was light and delicious I liked it alot but for pancakes it seemed to soak right in and disapear a bit. i imagine for crepes or something this would be outstanding.<br /><br />the company shipped super amazingly fast in a strong sturdy box. each syrup was packed in strong material individually. I recommend them and plan on trying more of their products.<br /><br />PS- i also tried using these flavors with each other or with maple in double whammy of flavor on pancakes- peach and strawberry was really good, also marionberry and maple...

However, this is so over priced that it doesn't make sense and I'm close to calling it a rip off...I pay $7.80 each for single cans and if I buy the case (of 6) it's about $6.00 per can.  Same product, same can at Restaurant Depot in San Diego.  Therefore, if I had time to do so, I'd sell it all day at $10 a can and make a good markup and the buyer would save a bunch.

review/summary: The last desperate act
review/text: The whole idea is keep fleas out of your house.  Once they have invaded What do you do?  I have tried every thing, sprays, powers you name it.  These have been temporary solution at best.  the best response to the invasion is to trap them.  Each of the invaders you trap is 200 fleas removed.  Once they are trapped, no kids.  Yes the trap works and it removes fleas with out the deadly chemicals.  If fleas get into your house and you prefer not to kill all the other residents of your house try the traps.<br /><br />Mike

review/summary: it works so I bought these refills
review/text: I have the trap and am on the second sticky pad (the unit that I<br />bought came with two sticky pads).<br /><br />So, I bought the refill pack (which comes with three sticky pads).<br />I use my trap in the room that the dog sleeps in.  In the daytime,<br />the dog is not in the room, the room is made dark, blinds closed,<br />door closed, from morning till night.  The trap gets about 3-4<br />fleas per day and after a month that sticky pad looks disgusting<br />and coated with fleas.  The key for me is to keep the room dark<br />during the day and keep the dog out of the room. The trap is the<br />only source of warmth and light in the room and attracts the fleas.<br /><br />This is a terrible flea season where I live, and nothing in the<br />yard, or frontline on the dog seems to help.  I walk my dog every<br />day so he will always pick fleas up.  In addition to the trap<br />I've tried nemotodes in the yard and wet down the dog and flea<br />comb them off my dog and drown those fleas in soapy water about<br />two to three times per week. I've also got diatomaceous earth<br />rubbed into his bedding.  I vacuum frequently.<br /><br />This trap thing is great because its<br />no work compared to all the other things I do to fight fleas.<br />So I recommend buying these refills

review/summary: Catches More Than Fleas
review/text: I first started using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000668Z96">Victor Ultimate Flea Trap</a> when I lived in California because we had a problem with sand fleas coming in our back patio screen door. We also didn't want to use any pesticides, since we had four small house pets.<br /><br />When we moved to Michigan, we continued using the traps because our child was born, and we felt even more strongly about avoiding pesticides. Although we did not have a flea problem, the traps have caught several types of spiders, the occasional house fly, a few random creepy crawlies, and even a hornet! Basically, they seem to trap anything attracted to the light/heat.<br /><br />We keep them tucked away, out of sight (ex: in a back corner of our furnace room, under furniture), and in places where the pets can't get too curious -- getting a refill stuck to your skin (or dog fur) is the absolute worse.<br /><br />All in all, I think we've been using these traps for nearly ten years now. The bulbs can be replaced with regular night light bulbs or the new LED bulbs.

review/text: I was getting bitten up every night. I bought 2 of these units and put one on the floor by my bed and one under my living room couch. I was amazed to see how many flees ended up on the pad. I found the best results when I kept my door open letting cold air in my house. it was about 50 degrees and the traps became extremely congested with fleas in that one day.

I have had much difficulty peeling some disks. In some instances I couldn't get the backing off the sticky disk at all. In total I have had 4 NG disks and returned 3 disks. 4 out of 40 in total is not acceptable.

If you cannot use sprays or are concerned about using sprays, this product is the next best items to use.  The pack comes with three sticky pads, but I would order two packs, the first time it's used the sticky pad will fill up fast.

review/summary: Almost Perfect
review/text: These work great. They're very, very sticky at first. Be careful not to touch the sticky part! My only negative comment is that the glue eventually dries up so it's not sticky anymore. Why is this a problem? Because it's a waste. I caught about 20 fleas on the first pad before it stopped being sticky. I could have caught many more fleas if the glue hadn't dried up. It doesn't dry real fast. I suppose it was about a month before I discovered that the pad wasn't sticky anymore. In the meantime I was still using it to catch fleas, thinking that it was still working. But it had dried up. Besides this, I'd like it if the manufacturer redesigned the trap so that it snapped closed more securely. The way it is now, the top can easily be knocked off, exposing the glue pad. Overall, I would recommend this, regardless of these two small drawbacks. (Sorry if you think I said "sticky" too much!)

Manufacturer should take care of the disks so they work and can be peeled back etirely without ripping, tearing, etc.

We plugged the product in and one hour later there were at least a dozen fleas stuck to the trap like glue! We have used it for a month and the trap is full! The trap is replaceable but since fleas are small, you can get a lot of life out of one. We do not leave it plugged in while we are not home, but when we are, it is plugged in and doing its job. Amazing product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you have fleas in your home, try this, no chemicals or poisons...............Try this product!

I did not want to spray toxic chemicals around them so after retreating the cats i set these traps out hoping for the best. Let me say that we had a bad flea issue and in less than a week it went from is that a flea to waking up walking to the bathroom and having 20+ fleas jump on your legs. So I ordered the traps and in a few days they got worse i was so happy when I got them. In just 1 night i caught dozens in less than a week we noticed 1 or 2 so we kept them on for a month it has been 2 months since we used the traps and we have not had a single flea in the house since.

review/text: The first couple days you really don't notice a change.  But then!  A few days after I started to catch fleas.  And a lot of the bites I was getting were FINALLY going away.  So now I'm still getting one now and then but not as frequent as I was.  I've had this about a month (2 months after my family's dog first started having a flea problem).  Now it's starting to dissipate and the flea traps do help catch the stray buggers.  It does catch spiders, stink bugs, ants and a lot of other bugs too!  (caught more of those kinds of bugs than any of the other ones surprising enough.)<br />Highly recommend.<br />p.s. Make sure you use other forms of flea control.  Just this alone will not cure the problem.

review/summary: Flea Trap WORKS!
review/text: In the past, I have used a metal type flea trap. I owned and operated a pet store and have had experience with several expensive methods of eliminating annoying fleas. This one works well. To end contamination, we just put it under our bed, and left it alone after vacuuming the carpet well. It ended the problem. To ensure that we were rid of the fleas, we purchased two traps, this one and the square trap you will also see advertised here as well. We have both going at the same time. One is going near the bed, and one underneath the bed. We have not seen a flea since installing these devices in our home, but, the traps are spotted with victims!!<br />Save yourself headache and frustration by making the purchase of two traps at once!<br />KittyKatKhan

They cost only $5.76 which is too small an amount to consider returning this item.

review/summary: Can't argue, does what it says!
review/text: After battling fleas this summer and wanting to know if I had things under control, I purchased 2 flea traps, this one and the Springstar one to see which was the better flea trap.<br /><br />First, the light is very bright so if you plan on using this in a bedroom keep that in mind. It would be better suited to going under the bed.<br /><br />Second, the main difference between the 2 traps is the amount of open space for fleas to get trapped. This trap has a large open space to catch more fleas, and the Spingstar has a smaller grid that traps less fleas. The trade off is, the Springstar is more aesthetically pleasing. That trap hides the trapped fleas better under a grid piece, and kids and pets can't get to the sticky pad. With this trap smaller children could easily reach inside, so again, something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Third, when assembling this trap the sticky pad was curved in the box. This meant that the pad refused to lay flat in the trap. A small problem that could be fixed with tape if need be.<br /><br />Overall this trap is a good investment. I have had it set up for a little over a week now and have caught 2 adult fleas and gnats. This is a cost effective way to see if you have your flea infestation under control while not using chemicals. Since adult fleas can emerge from pupas months after an infestation it's far better to lure them to a trap to die then let them bite your animals.<br /><br />If you're choosing between this and the Springstar it boils down to a matter of personal preference. If you plan to leave the trap out for people to see, go with the Spingstar. If you want a large, industrial type trap, go with this one. Both caught pretty good amounts of fleas and lots of gnats.

review/text: The idea seems logical and very attractive. But after 3 weeks it has trapped zero fleas. My cat has a flea allergy, so it doesn't take but one flea to set off her allergy. At night this is the only light except a night light in the bathroom. I'll try the suggestion to make the whole area dark except for the trap--maybe that will work.<br /><br />I have tried vacuuming, and the solution of vacuuming daily for 7 days seems more effective, although admittedly more work.<br /><br />Best think I can say about the flea trap is it makes a very effective night light.

Anyhow this does work (I mean the actual unit not the refills) but it could never kill an entire population...the heat attracts the fleas and they jump and get stuck that's it...BUT LET ME SAY THAT THIS IS GREAT TO USE AFTER YOU'VE TREATED YOUR HOUSE TO SEE IF FLEAS ARE STILL AROUND...THAT'S WHAT I USE MINE FOR ;-)

review/summary: Simple and it works.
review/text: This won't be the only product you need to use for flea control but it definitely reduces the number of fleas in the home.  Super cheap and it works.  Buy the refills when you buy the unit because you will need them fairly quickly if you have a bad infestation.

review/summary: Helps to keep control of all sorts of bugs
review/text: I bought this just for fleas, but it catches mosquitos and spiders, ants, etc., too.  I still recommend spraying your carpets, though.  This is an additional help between carpet sprayings.

review/summary: The Flea Trap That Traps
review/text: I bought the Victor Ultimate Flea Trap many years ago in the local market.  It wasn't as sturdy as it is today but it worked.  Than, I could no longer find the refills.<br />I was happy to find the trap and the refills on Amazon.<br />With all the stray cats in my neighborhood, the new flea trap and the refills have really helped.  Even the ants go in it.

review/text: Excellent product so got a refill pack. It says 3 but the one I got only had 2 in it!  So a star off for that. (Still no response from Amazon either as of 8/28/09)
