review/text: I ordered this product because it was provided complimentary in a hotel that I stayed at. The green tea and genmaicha is the one that I like best but it would be even better if the toasted flavor was stronger. For the price, there are better teas available.

review/text: I tried this tea after getting a little tired of the plain green tea I was used to buying. I was very surprised and impressed by the flavor! I prepare it with sugar and cream and it tastes delicious. I would buy this tea more, but at my local herb store they sell if for $8 a box. I love tea, but the price is a little steep. Still, it serves as a nice treat for myself every once in a while.

review/summary: Very nice flavor
review/text: I first had gen mai cha at a local upscale Japanese restaurant/sushi bar where they blend their own. Whole Foods carries the Numi version so I bought a box there and was very happy with the flavor. I've been drinking it for about a month now and recently had the restaurant's version and couldn't really taste a difference. When I saw this available on Amazon with a subscription, I signed up right away! Much better price than Whole Foods (appx. $6/box). Overall, I'm very happy with this tea and definitely love the great price on Amazon.

review/summary: What a difference a tomato makes
review/text: I have been searching for a canned tomato that wasn't more water than tomato and had a nice tomato taste. After reading several reviews I thought that I would give Mangia Carmelina Italian chopped tomatoes a try and what a difference. The chopped tomatoes are a bit saucy, but the tomato puree they are in is perfect for making a nice sauce.  I enjoy the chopped tomatoes because I can make up a great sauce for my pasta in about 30 minutes.  If you want more tomato in your product then I would suggest you  try Mangia Carmelina's whole tomatoes in puree.  The puree is so rich in either one that you will not need to add tomato paste to thicken it. I would definitely recommend these products.

review/text: For those of you who did not get the "San Marzano', look at the price. If you paid approximately $30.00, then you will get regular ( but wonderful ) Italian tomatoes. San Marzano tomatoes will cost you about $50.00. They are worth it, but only for certain uses. I buy both kinds.

review/summary: best canned tomatoes
review/text: These canned tomatoes are a product of Italy. Therefore, they are not only delicious, they are naturally low in sodium. The Europeans do not feel the need to artificially load up on salt in their canned products. This means that the cook gets to determine how salty the dish tastes. Imagine that !

review/text: The tomatoes pictured clearly state San Marzano, however, the actual cans when received do not mention that the tomatoes come from the region and only specify coming from Italy.  After speaking with customer service, I was assured that the replacement case would be the San Marzano type.  This was not the case as I was sent exactly the same cans as the first shipment.<br /><br />In the end, if you are really looking for Italian tomatoes from San Marzano, go with another brand, this is not it.

I contacted Amazon and they said they would send another case of the correct tomatoes.  Well, I got another case of the same regular tomatoes.  Either Amazon is cheating their customers or the company they are contracting with are cheating Amazon customers.

review/summary: Mellow Mutt Chews are the way to go!!
review/text: These chicken strips are a very easy and natural way to calm down my dog. When she gets anxious, she is  65 lbs of quivering and unmovable. But, if I give her a few of the mellow mutt chicken strips 10-15 mins. before a car ride, or a storm, she thinks she is getting a great treat and it does just as it implies...mellows. She sleeps better too.  Thanks for such a wonderful antidote for my dog! I break them up into bite size chews...my dog tends to swallow big chunks and the strips are tough and hard, they get stuck in her throat. She loves the attention she gets when I give her the chunk by chunk treats! She knows the bag, when she sees it on the counter, she will sit and whine until she gets one. I cannot let her see me put the treats away or she will sit and whine at the cupboard where they are stored. I think she knows they make her feel better!

He remains pretty anxious/wound up even after eating them.<br /><br />However, I can imagine that like any treat, they provide some help with anxiety by simply being a distraction. I'm satisfied with this treat, but will probably get a different Dogswell jerky next time, like the ones for joints or good breath.<br /><br />I do love the size of this bag. TONS of treats in it, lasts me forever.<br /><br />Also, for real anxiety issues, I have heard the ThunderShirt dog wrap is amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HEY5CS">Thundershirt Dog Anxiety Treatment- (Medium) - Heather Gray</a>.

Too mushy?<br /><br />Well it arrived packed with cold packs, not enough to freeze it though. The texture, flavor and everything about it was wonderful!<br /><br />I was also worried that since it was so cheap that it would be a low quality feta, but it was WAY better than anything I've been able to get around here. And you certainly can't beat that even with the shipping it was cheaper a 1/4 the cost of what I can find locally.<br /><br />Of course there was that issue that it was 2lbs of feta, which I can't go through very quickly. Fortunately, all the greek sites I found said that freezing it is fine. The texture will change slightly and may put off some people if they just want to snack on it, but its perfectly fine for cooking, salads, omlettes, etc.<br /><br />I have added this seller to my list of favorites and expect to return again and again.

review/text: Ok, I have to say that I was very skeptical about buying Feta cheese online without trying it first.  There are so many vendors out there that claim to have quality feta cheese and I've always been disappointed.  I'm glad that I took a chance, I grew up in the Mediterranean region and this feta cheese equals in quality to the ones back home.  This feta cheese is absolutely delightful! It's perfect, I wouldn't change a thing.  The price is very reasonable, the shipping is fast to allow for the cheese to be fresh upon arrival. I cannot express enough how glad I am to have found this vendor!

review/summary: Best feta I've had in years
review/text: Tired of finding nothing but alleged feta made from cow milk, I searched around town and found something made from goat milk, but in France. Apparently, this is what's become popular in the US. It's hardly feta. It's mild to the point where it doesn't deserve the name. Hence the popularity, of course.<br /><br />So I turned to the internet and purchased two pounds of this. It was an ecstasy to eat it. If anything, it was too good, because I couldn't leave it alone. I'll be buying in larger quantities from now on.<br /><br />It's sharp, very sharp. As is proper, it's kept in brine, which also gives it a little extra saltiness, but it can be rinsed if you're going to cook with it. The consistency is excellent - it's a little crumbly, though if you're careful, you can keep it in a cut shape.

The Dragonwell tea from Coffee Bean Direct does not look like my other more expensive loose green tea which is actually olive green in color.  The color of this tea is very dark, almost black and the taste is more like ordinary black tea.

review/text: I haven't given it to my dog yet (a 6 pound Chihuahua)...in a few days maybe...and then I plan to update this review.<br /><br />The bone I received was 3.75 inches long by 1 inch to 1.25 inches wide and deep.  Just the right size for my doggie.  The center is hollow with diameter ranging between 0.5 and 0.75 inches, so I can stuff some peanut butter or other treats inside.  The bone thickness ranges from 3/16 to 7/16 inches.<br /><br />Here is what's on the wrapper:<br />* all-natural sterilized bone 4"<br />* beef bone<br />* torn pieces may be a chocking hazard<br />* supervision is advised<br />* not for human consumption<br />* reorder # RR22704<br />* UPC 721343227601<br />* manufactured for Tops Pet Products, Beverly, MA 01915<br />* made in Brazil<br /><br />My purpose in buying this item is for my dog to have something to chew on (i.e., something for him to do, and to help keep his teeth clean).<br /><br />I also purchased a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR15U">Kong Toy Sm 3 In</a> at the same time, so the little guy would have some variety.

review/summary: great for stuffing
review/text: This is what it is. It's a hollow bone with no bone flavor. My dog won't touch it on its own, as it doesn't strike him as an animal product now that all the meaty goodness has been bleached.<br /><br />However, it makes a great alternative to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8">Kong Toy Lrg 4.5 In</a>, and I use two bones for this purpose. I stuff them with peanut butter or wet food and freeze over night. Now, they no longer seem like flavorless bones to the dog, and he will be entertained for up to an hour. Great for when we leave the house or want some quiet time. If you're having trouble with the kong being destroyed (which I have not), or as a supplement so you have a few treat toys for the dog throughout the day.  Note that the stuffing capacity is smaller than the Kong.

They are pre-packaged in small serving sized portions making them ideal to include in lunch boxes. They do have salt added. If this bothers you the Just Tomatoes brand is salt-free but does not come in individual servings. I tend to give my baby the Just Tomatoes brand because of there being less salt, but these are super convenient for on the go snacking.

Unfortunately they stopped carrying it so I had to research and found it on Amazon.com. I've been ordering it ever since. It has the natural sweetness of the corn and the saltiness that is perfect for a snack. I usually order 2 24packs and bring one to the office and have it as a late morning pick me up. It really does take care of the craving for something sweet.

We dehydrate alot of things, so why not corn?<br /><br />Like I said, this product is both interesting, unique, and simple.<br /><br />When I opened my first bag it made me think of bird food.<br /><br />The ingredients for this product are very straight forward--100% sweet corn,sea salt and nothing else.<br /><br />At least you know this product is not full of pesticides!<br /><br />Give it a try, you may like it like I do.<br /><br />Iam happy I finally decided to give it a try and buy this product.<br /><br />The product itself is individual snack sized bags, but then all of the bags are enclosed into a large plastic bag, that is how it is shipped.<br /><br />For those of you who do like corn, want to try someting simple and unique, maybe corn season is over and you don't want frozen or canned corn, you might want to try this product.

review/text: Very good flavor: floral and slightly fruity.  Big leaves that'll stay where they belong in a filtering teapot, so you don't get weird floaties in your tea.  No funky aftertastes or off flavors like some cheap bagged green tea has.  All around, a great tea.<br />Works best with a filtering teapot or infuser mug so that the tea has enough room to expand and you get the best flavor.  (filtering teapot=a teapot with a filter built into the spout.  good for home.  infuser mug=a mug with a little strainer like thingy inside, you put the tea into the strainer thingy then add hot water, and when the tea is brewed you take the strainer thingy and therefore the tea leaves out. good for travel.)

review/text: My marzipan pigs arrived in great shape. Not battered by shipping. The image shown is accurate. They are extremely cute. Also, DELICIOUS. Sweet but not cloying. Plenty of detectable almond flavor. Great texture. I've tried a few other marzipan pigs as stocking stuffers. These are my favorite - and my kids totally love them, too! They particularly enjoy discussing which portion of the piggy they'd like to eat next: the rump, the belly, the head.<br /><br />One extremely minor and picky gripe. I wish Niederegger would make the pigs rumps slightly cuter. How about some pig cheeks instead of a rather undefined bump with a tail? Hmmm. On second thought, it's probably OK to skip some of that anatomical detail.

review/summary: Cute little pig! Highest quality Marzipan. Read on for the story here.
review/text: In Germanic/Swiss folklore a Pig is a Good-luck symbol. Many times, a marzipan pig might have a gold coin (paper) in its mouth, as an added symbol of good luck and good fortune.<br /><br />In Swiss-German, a colloquial expression is: "Er hats Schwein". This does not mean he has a pig, rather it means He's Lucky!<br /><br />To people who know the meaning of the Lucky Pig, this is a great present. If you're just into a great taste-treat, what is better for Marzipan Aficianados than a nice generous piece of Niederegger Marzipan!<br /><br />Lubeck Niederegger is the best, highest quality of Marzipan! This is a lovely gift-<br />highly appreciated. Keeps for months (keep it cool, OK in fridge).<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is like no other! Search them on the web for the full story. Highest quality Marzipan originated in Turkey, under the Ottomans. When the Turks came up through Europe, all the way to the Gates of Vienna, they brought Marzipan with them. -The Croissant bread (Turkish Crescent)  was developed to warn people the Turks were coming-<br /><br />The Germans, Swiss, Austrians, and Swedes are most renowned for Marzipan in Europe. Check out the Niederegger site -a nice site! Great site-learn about Marzipan quickly-nice story.<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is made with more Almonds, less sugar, filler than others. Simply, ground almonds, rose water, sugar makes the best Marzipan.  No filler, no almond extracts.<br />Lower quality Marzipans need that since they have a lower concentration of almonds.<br /><br />With WWII, the Cafe Niederegger in Lubeck, Germany (East Germany for many years) was destroyed: 1942 "The caf&eacute; was destroyed by bombing and the company's archives went up in flames."<br /><br />Thankfully, the cafe  was rebuilt & this fine Marzipan is still available. With German reunification, it is easier to get this great marzipan again. Highly recommended!

review/text: When I first started trying to eat healthy, I loved Progresso canned lentil soup. When I started looking for organic alternatives, I found this.<br /><br />Eden sometimes misses the mark on its prepared bean products, skewing more to the vegan-commune-TVP crowd than the typical western diet. But these lentils are rich and flavorful. You can dilute them to make a lentil soup (add some soy sauce or Braggs liquid aminos), or eat them as is.<br /><br />Excellent with sharp cheddar cheese and whole grain bread.

review/text: I first bought Eden Organic Lentils from another online source.  Now that my supply is almost out, I came to Amazon hoping to find it here.  You can't go wrong with this product.  The lentils are cooked to the perfect tenderness, and there is a bit of seasoning but it isn't overwhelming like in some products.  I think it's delicious all by itself. Add some veggies if you want, serve as-is over rice or mix it with noodles, it's all good.<br /><br />I recently read an article titled The 10 Best Foods for Healthy Hair.  One of the foods listed is legumes, which of course includes lentils.  And by the way, Amazon's price for this product is excellent, especially if you choose the subscription service.

review/text: Soooo delicious. I've been drinking these since I was a kid, and had quite a few. This is essentially just extra fizzy soda with really nice flavors.<br /><br />This is just ramune, but in a "classier" American packaging with a really cute mascot &lt;3.<br />Really refreshing; be sure to chill it before drinking for maximum deliciousness. Not too sweet.<br /><br />It may be troubling for someone who never experienced opening a ramune bottle to, well, open it. Be sure to read the instructions carefully, or you can actually go to Marble Pop's website and there's really cool graphics and such that explains how to open it. Simply just rip the plastic seal, pop out the green "plunger", set it on the table, put the narrow end of the plunger on the marble and push as hard as you can. This is actually the funnest part of the whole experience.

review/summary: The closest thing to breastmilk!!
review/text: When our spontaneous triplets were born at 34.4 weeks gestation I was determined to breastfeed them and was able to do so for the first 7 weeks, supplementing with Enfamil Enfacare (22 calorie preemie formula), as directed by our pediatrician.  In the NICU they were getting as much milk as I could make enhanced with the Enfamil and when I stopped nursing we were told we should stick with the Enfamil due to the triplets' low birth weights (5 pounds each at birth).  Once they were no longer getting breast milk their poops became more solid and bulky and much more stinky.<br /><br />Our triplets just turned 5 months old and we were given the go-ahead from the pediatrician to switch their formula to a regular formula as long as we mixed it rich, using more than the recommended amount to bulk up the calories until they were 6 months old.  I was dying to switch them because there are many food allergies in my family and knowing all the new food-allergy research I wanted the kids to get the probiotics into their system before we started solids.  We started by using the Good Start for 1/3 of their bottles, Enfacare for 2/3, to make the switch gradual and less shocking on their tummies.  They have been a little cranky and gassy while their system adjusts to a new formula but the proof is in the diaper.  Since the switch, the kids' poops have gone back to that sweet(er) smelling, yellow mustard seed looking, classic breast milk poop.  I've also  noticed that they are pooping a lot less, which means that their bodies are using the food it gets more effectively and efficiently.  I am blown away by this.  I can not believe what a huge difference just a little of this formula has made just a few days.  I feel confident that my instinct to switch them to a better formula was correct all along.<br /><br />Yes, it might not mix as easily (invest in a Dr. Brown's Formula Pitcher!) but it does not produce all the bubbles the Enfamil did, nor does it smell as bad, and it won't stain like other formulas.  The comfort proteins and probiotics make this the perfect formula.  Breast milk may be best but this is the next best thing!

review/summary: Ignorance is bliss, Hydrolized protein made using enzymes is NOT MSG & you can buy these at w-mart for $144.
review/text: This is great formula, but despite scare tactics of whacko tree huggers who dropped out of school, the Hydrolized protein in this formula is made through enzyme process which does not result in MSG. There are 3 significantly different processes used in USA by mfg to hydrolize protein and just because one results in MSG, does not mean all processes do. These same size and type formulas can also be purchased elsewhere for much cheaper and instantly with no shipping charges. Check your local WallyWorld.

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: My baby, Ryan, was born with a heart defect that required major surgery to correct. The doctor that performed his surgery recommended I mix formula with breast milk to suppliment his caloric intake. The hospital started him on Infamil but he didn't like it and spit up a lot. I started using Nestle Good Start With Natural Cultures when my baby was around one month old. I have never had a problem with the formula not mixing up well, but I always use filtered water that is room temperature or above. My baby has thrived on this formula and is so healthy the doctors can hardly believe it. Usually children born with heart problems have trouble gaining weight and are more prone to being sick; that has not been the case with my child, Ryan. He is 6 months old and is 19lbs, 28" tall, and  very strong and healthy.

review/summary: Best out of the bunch
review/text: My son would not breastfeed so I had to supplement and eventually supplant with formula. It was difficult finding one that did not make him constipated or give him gas pains. I learned that at the young age of 1-2 months it's bound to happen with any formula but this seemed the most gentle on his stomach and eventually he got used to it (at 3 months). This formula has a touch less iron than the the other brands, has a good taste, doesn't stain as much, and is the only formula I know of with probiotics for their immune system (important if your baby is not getting breastmilk). Only draw back would be that it does not dissolve easily and is more expensive than other brands and comes with lesser value coupons. Nevertheless, the positives outweigh  the negatives, and I would use this with my next child from the beginning if breastfeeding doesn't work out

review/summary: Wonderful Product!
review/text: I have not had any problems getting this powder formula to dissolve.<br /><br />Our three week old daughter was crying in pain after using Similac Isomil Soy (what the hospital recommended for sensitive stomachs...etc).  It just broke my heart to see my daughter in pain after she had a bottle.  My wife and I knew that something was not setting well with her tummy.  I ventured off to Wal-Mart to read labels to find out which formula had a good amount of iron...but not as much as the other brands.  The standard amount of iron per serving is 1.8 mg.  The Nestle Good Start Natural Cultures Infant Formula with DHA & ARA has 1.5 mg of iron per serving.  I thought that the iron content was making her gassy and constipated.  We switched her to Nestle Good Start and she is doing great now.  No more crying, fussing or gassiness.  I am not sure if the iron content is the real reason for her tummy aces (iron is essential for the development of children).  Whatever the different it is, we now have a happy baby.

With this formulas more regular bowel  he has regular bowel movement and thus he also drinks regularly. His gas trouble is also controlled. Although I introduced this when he was three months and no plans to change formula.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's expensive then other formulas.<br />As other reviewer noticed it doesn't dissolve 100% most of the time.

review/text: My daughter was put on this because the other GS was making her constipated. First they tried soy but it didn't help. The only downfall is she seems to spit up more. But her bowl movements are normal and she is not half as gassy and belches much easier. She also prefers the taste of natural cultures to enfamil ar lipil which i tried because of the spitting up. I have to mix the two. Sounds outragious but it works for her.

I recommend to try out with the smallest pack and see if your baby likes it or else you would be stuck with a $35 case you need to toss out.

review/text: Our son has been on this formula for more than half a year now and we never had any problems with hard stools, winds or stomach pain. He also accepted the taste rightaway. The other major advantage is that Nestl&eacute; distributes the same formula in different countries, so that we had already switched to 'BEBA Protect Plus' in Switzerland before moving to the US knowing that we'd have no problems with the 'Gerber Good Start Protect Plus'. In comparison to the German brand we used before, the Nestl&eacute; formula dissolves somewhat less quickly, but not to a degree that it would be any problem.

review/text: Our first daughter had constipation problems with a few different formulas that we tried. We tried this one and it solved the problem. As such, we started our second daughter on Nestle Good Start Protect Plus. She is just fine with no problems.<br /><br />I buy a lot of things from Amazon and their prices are usually very good. If fact, I bought this formula a few months ago from Amazon at a great price. However, the last few times I checked, they only offer it through an Amazon affiliate at a higher price and it's not even eligible for "Amazon Prime" shipping. With shipping, it costs less to go to my local store.<br /><br />I hope Amazon brings this back. I would prefer to buy from them, but I'm not overpaying.

review/summary: The next best thing to breast milk
review/text: When my infant grandchild had to stop drinking breast milk for various reasons, this is what my daughter's pediatrician recommended. Gerber is one of the most trusted names in baby products, and this particular product has agreed very well with my grandchild.<br /><br />The current price on Amazon of $126 for a pack of 6 is the lowest price that I have found, and is about $30 less than what my daughter was paying at another online site before I found this on Amazon.<br /><br />Here are some specific things to keep in mind:<br /><br />1. The shelf life of a container is about one month, so I would recommend not ordering more than one pack of 6 at a time.<br /><br />2. This is extremely easy to use. For each two ounces of formula, just fill the provided plastic scoop and pour it into a bottle filled with ordinary tap water at room temperature.<br /><br />3. This mixes instantly. After you pour the desired amount of powder into the bottle, put the nipple on the bottle and just shake it a few times. The powder easily dissolves without any lumps to clog the nipple. You will really appreciate this ease of use for middle of the night feedings.<br /><br />4. Once you mix the powder, it can only be used for an hour. However, because it is so easy to mix, you can mix a smaller amount to start, and if your child wants more formula, it takes just seconds to make it.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a quality product for which Amazon currently has the best price at the moment.

review/summary: Good Start = Good Stuff!!
review/text: My daughter is now 5.5 months old and has been on this formula for 2.5 months. Originally she was exclusively breastfed. And thank god we did that because we very quickly determined that she has a milk intolerance - NOT allergy - without having to put her through the trauma of switching formulas. Specifically she is intolerant of the casein proteins in cow's milk but she does not have a problem with the whey proteins. So when it was time to transition to formula we asked the doctor to recommend a non-casein based formula and this was what they recommended. She has had ZERO problems with this formula. She is still her lean healthy happy self. As for the mixing issue... we just use our standard knives that came with our utensil sets to mix it in the Dr. Brown's bottles. We use the tap water from our kitchen faucet set to warm. It's really no biggie. I also love that I can buy it by the case here on Amazon. Makes life sooooo much easier.

review/text: My Son was put on this by a Pediatric GI Doctor because the other formulas were making him constipated and his poop very acidic. She just said that the water should only be luke-warm otherwise the probiotics are killed and never put a mixed bottle in the microwave--this also will kill the good bacteria. I nuke the water for about 20 seconds, mix well, stick my clean finger into the water--if it is the same temperature as my hand--I mix in the formula, mix well and feed my son. His GI issues are getting better and we're very happy. I just recommend talking to a Specialist before playing with a bunch of different formulas. My son was in pain off and on for 8+ weeks due to our Pediatrician just guessing.

review/summary: Great formula
review/text: I started my daughter on formula at 8 weeks because my milk supply got really low and she was never satisfied.  I originally had her on the Similac Advance, but once they recalled their formula for beetle parts and larvae getting into their formula I immediately took her off.  Even though the can I had wasn't part of the recall, I was thoroughly grossed out.  Everyone told me to try Target's brand because it has the same ingredients as Similac and is a lot cheaper, but I decided to go with Good Starts Protect Plus because it was the only one that had the probiotics.  I wanted my daughter to get some antibodies since she was no longer getting breastmilk.  The switch to this formula was pretty easy.  She had one day of really bad gas as she adjusted, but she was fine after that.  It makes her poop green, but I'm assuming that's all of the iron in it. I get coupons in the mail from Gerber which really help, although you can't really use them on Amazon.  Overall, this seems to be a really good formula and my baby enjoys it!

review/text: I was sent home from the hospital with Similac Advance as a suppliment to breastfeeding (as we just couldn't get 'on to it' to start with).  When my daughter was 3 days old she ate a bottle of Similac and threw IT ALL UP.  Then, she did it again the next day......so since I had a nice Good Start coupon to try the product for like $6, I went ahead and bought it.....I was going to switch slowly--but I only combined one bottle and she was immediately less fussy.  By the time we switched she HAS NOT SPEWED ANY AT ALL (now 15 weeks)!!  Comparing, my friend supplimenting--on Enfamil, she informed me her daughter would have messy diapers ALL DAY, my daughter only has 2-4 messy diapers a day.  My daughter is much more at ease.  As for the 'mixing issue'......I use bottled water, and have no problem by just shaking it as long as the bottle is dry when I put the powder in.  If you add powder to water, then it clumps.  I agree that the formula is more expensive here, but the product is worth its weight in gold!

They have had no issues with gas, fussiness, etc.  However, Amazon has really missed the boat with pricing on this item.  That is the only reason for a lower review.  My local Target sells the 24oz can for 19.99-21.09.  Find a few coupons and save even more.  Wal-Mart is also on par with the 20/can price.  I know some may not have one of these stores in their area(yes, there are parts of the US that Walmart hasn't found yet...) but considering you'd be saving at least 20 dollars on the six cans it may just be worth the drive...

review/text: My newest addition likes this product.  I did switch a few times between brands but always stuck to milk based after breastfeeding. My son didn't seem to mind the switching, he seems to not be picky at all.<br />I like it because you get 1.5 the amount you would get with the other name brand formulas for the same price.  It's also not as bottom of the line as the generic brands and I like to keep a few companies in business instead of letting low prices become a monopoly.<br />When I mix the formula with water I swirl it around instead of shaking up and down.  It mixes well for me but for some reason when my husband mixes it, it ends up chunky..  I think it needs to be swirled immediately after scooped into the water and it will mix fine.  the longer it sits unmixed the more chance to get chunky.

review/text: I have a two-month old baby. We fed him with Similac Organic in first three weeks. We switched to Good Start Supreme after he had acne over his face. Acne has gone after using GS formual for two weeks(we are not sure it's because of the formula), so I bought two cans of Good Start natural Culture fascinated by the words"supporting immune system". Since using both of GS products, we notice he has difficult to swallow. One time we saw milk was dripping out from his noses. We were trying to shake the milk well, but no matter how hard we shake, some powder never dissolve with water. We decide to switch back to Similac Advance. Considering other benefits such as easily digest, I rate it 3 stars.

review/summary: Pace The Original Picante Sauce, Medium
review/text: This has to be the best salsa that I have ever tasted in my life, it has the perfect amount of heat and it has such wonderful flavor that really hits the spot with anything you like to eat with salsa.  I reccomend this and you wont be dissapointed.  My personal favorite to eat this salsa with is corn chips of course, but goes great on pasta, burritos, and nachos.

review/summary: Love this
review/text: This is our first time trying out this product and we love it! I have to admit the other reviews saying that the ratio isn't right, yes, there are lots of sunflower seeds but less dried fruits, I wish they would have add more fruits cuz it's the main reason I am loving this product. Overall I enjoy this product, great packaging, easy to carry around - my hubby brings a bunch of them to the office and enjoy some afternoon snacks.

review/summary: nut to dried fruit ratio no longer right
review/text: It seems as though in the last couple orders I made of these, the nut to dried fruit ratio has changed and not for the better.  There are too many peanuts and sunflowers compared to the dried fruit.  There seems to be more in the package, but i think because they have packed in more nuts and less dried fruit.  With the latest orders, I end up throwing away remaining peanuts and sunflower seeds that are bland to eat on their own.  These are better when you get the right ratio per handful.

review/summary: Mango Flavor is non existent
review/text: I bought this for the mango but i could not taste or smell any mango flavor in this.<br /><br />This contains lot of sunflower seeds, Sugared red fruit pectin (mango), some  cashews, lot of raisins ....<br />I was not satisfied as i expected to get some mango goodness.<br /><br />I highly recommend this instead. Its got good mix of cashews, peanuts, banana chips that retain flavor and smell<br />. And its 2 oz for $5 more, extremely satisfying.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001651282">Planters Trail Mix, Fruit & Nut, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 72)</a>

review/summary: Tastes like S**T--- Do NOT buy this
review/text: I never write reviews but this mix was so bad I felt obligated to warn others. I bought this from my local grocery store and this is the WORST margarita mix I have tried in my life---this is saying something because I generally like most things. I thought to myself, " I don't want to waste it because I bought it so I'll just mix this in with other mixed drinks/cocktails that I make."<br />Everything that I mix this with tastes worse. It's hard to drown out the flavor.<br /><br />For the love of all things alcoholic, save your money.<br />(My margarita tasted like "classic lime" flavored horse piss.)

review/summary: Best learning to self-feed food EVER!
review/text: We tried these for our 10month son while in Canada.  He LOVES both the banana and vegetable flavors.  We love them as they are 1) not as messy as the arrowroot teething biscuits (while great- baby spit and biscuit = cement) and 2) are larger than puffs so occupy him for longer periods of time (car ride from CA to TN and waiting to mom/dad to make dinner).  Plus the dog loves them too when our son shares them with him.

review/text: My 10-month daughter does like eating these rick rusks, so we ordered some.<br />We are very angry after we received them and found all of them will be expired on this Aug. And these products can not be returned.<br />We do not know why they do not show us the expire date of their products?

review/summary: False Advertising
review/text: FYI... When Amazon is having a 'hot fire' sale on Grocery products, BEWARE! They are simply trying to rid themselves of old inventory. This has happened to me twice and I'm just starting to catch on. This is a snack for babies/children and I wonder how Amazon expects a child, who may be eating this for the first time at five or six months, food that is nearing its expiration date.<br /><br />Amazon as an aside, if you continue the practice of selling products nearing their expiration date without giving customers the option of returning them, you are toying with a class action lawsuit. #JustSaying
