review/summary: Fantastic gourmet chip - this flavor is one of the best.
review/text: I purchased these chips for my mobile vending cart. Because I have Amazon Prime the cost per bag is really good as far as a reseller goes. Each flavor is really good in its own right. These chips the Asian Sweet and Spicy are just so tasty. Its just the right amount of sweet and the slightest bit of spice that makes these a fantastic tasting chip.<br /><br />Lets talk about details:<br /><br />Chip thickness (+)<br />These are gourmet chips and the quality is there from the moment you open the bag. Each one is crunchy and not too thick but just enough to let you know you didn't buy a bag of Lays.<br /><br />Grease (+)<br />These are NOT greasy chips. Depending on the flavor they are just mildy seasoned and not coated in a heavy grease or oil.<br /><br />Flavor (+)<br />Each flavor stands completely on its own. You could do a blind taste test of each one of these flavors sold by Deep River and I bet you could tell what it was. None of the flavors are overpowering except maybe the Jalapeno flavor which is honestly too hot and I love hot food.<br /><br />Resale (+)<br />You may not resell these but at the current price and using Prime shipping the cost per bag allows you to make a decent profit.<br /><br />Overall:<br />These are great tasting, unique flavored chips that are hands down better than the ones you can get in bulk at a Sams or BJ's. Do yourself a favor and try a bag or two. I bet you'll love em like we do.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.

review/text: I like these chips, even though they are a little different than chips I am used to. I love that they are reduced fat, but be warned, they are extremely crunchy. So crunchy that I have to turn the volume up on the TV to hear it when I'm chewing them. The taste is quite good though and I like crunchy salty food. I will probably order them again.

review/text: I took a chance on these and they are awesome.  They are crisp and not at all greasy.  I like the Lay's Kettle Chips, but these are really much better, less greasy, maybe a bit more crisp too.  The rosemary is good - it's not overpowering and it tastes like rosemary.  No MSG.  Hits the salty snack craving just right.  I like the size too - it's enough to satisfy a craving but keeps me from eating a whole big bag.  Which I'd probably do with these, if that's what I had.  I'll definitely order them again.  My husband and 16 year old both really like them too.

review/summary: Keep it simple
review/text: Just to keep it simple...more of a comparison than a total review.  I love jalapeno chips - look mostly for the level of spice, then pepper flavor, good crunch, and not loaded down with salt.<br /><br />With that said, these Deep River Snacks chips (jalapeno flavor) are:<br />1. Better than the Lays Jalapeno.  (Deep RIver have the same spice level, which is lacking.  Neither have a lot of pepper flavor.)<br />2. About the same as the jalapeno chips that the "World Market" branded chips.  (World Market has a little more spice, but also a lot more salt.)<br />3. Not nearly as good as Tim's Cascade Jalapeno chips.  (Tims has more pepper flavor, more spice, a little bit better crunch...but also have MSG.)<br /><br />It's not to say these chips are bad, but just what the 3-stars says "It's OK."  There are better, there are worse...to me, these are right in the middle of the pack.

review/summary: Awesome Goodness! (deep river kettle chips, swt maui onion [pack of 24])
review/text: Before you turn to other name brands out there, give these a try. Although the Maui Onion can be a bit salty at times, i can still say these are amongst the crunchiest and tastiest chips I have ever had. Now i have tried both the barbeque and Asian style flavor, but still I must say these are the best. If you are looking for something to snack on that tastes good, these are the ones for you. Its better than the pringle's commercial, since these are harder to put down once you start.

review/summary: Pretty good, but prefer other jalapeno chips
review/text: I was expecting some "serious flavor" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips.

There is the right amount of vinegar, virtually every single chip I have tasted is done just right, no burned chips, and they have an excellent thickness to impart just the correct amount of potato taste.<br /><br />They go great with lunches or as a snack. They are very economical. Beats the heck in terms of quality, taste, and price to buying these at work or out and about (I bought the 2 ounce bags).

review/text: These chips are very spicy to say the least, my tongue burned too much to finish the small individual serving bag. They have an overpowering amount of some Asian spice, perhaps ginger, but it is way too strong and you are left with a very unpleasant taste. I bought 24 of the small size bags but could not bring myself to like the flavor, it all ended up in the trash.  This is definitely a chip that will appeal to only certain palates. I do like the sweet onion flavor of this brand but this Asian flavor was too much of a good thing!

review/text: I loved kettle chips from the moment I tried them but I felt absolutely disgusting every time I had the Kettle Brand. Though very tasty and crunchy, they were also very oily. With Deep River Snacks, they've got the crunch and taste without that repulsive burst of oil in your mouth with each crunch that Kettle Brand had. I LOVE the Sweet Onion Maui and Mesquite BBQ. The Jalapeno flavor does spicy justice and the Rosemary & olive Oil is very unique for a chip. I wish they had a sour cream and onion flavor but I love them regardless.

review/text: I did a search on Amazon for Kettle reduced fat chips, hoping to find a good deal on Kettle brand chips.  I stumbled upon these Deep River reduced fat kettle chips, and liked the per bag price (works out to about $1.50 per bag, about half the price of a similarly sized bag of Kettle brand chips at my local grocery store).  I am so glad I ordered these.  I love the taste, and I love the texture, and never would have guessed they were reduced fat.  I particularly like the short list of ingredients: Potatoes, Sunflower or Corn oil, and Salt.  That's it.<br /><br />I do wish Amazon would make it easy to find the nutritional information...so, here are the basics: 12-chip serving (28g) is 120 calories, 6g fat, 1g fiber.<br /><br />I will definitely order these again.

When I received them, I noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes! I know how kettle chips should look, and I know what normal marks look like on chips. These were rotten. After waiting over a month for a response from the company, I finally found a phone number and called them, only to be told there was nothing they could do. The sad thing is, the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty. Obviously they just don't care about consistent quality, so stay away from these chips!

review/summary: I guess not for everyone, but boy are they good
review/text: This is by far my favorite flavor of Funky Monkey fruit snacks. Here's the rundown--you'll like these if you're into the following traits:<br /><br />: they're *crunchy*, because they're freeze-dried and not traditionally dried with sugar and/or sulphur. This is why the label says "fruit that crunches"<br /><br />: they're subtle! I'm perplexed by reviews calling them "too sweet," as there's absolutely nothing in there aside from freeze-dried pineapple sprinkled with powdered freeze-dried guava. The pineapple flavor shines through, but you get more of the guava flavor toward the finish. If you like pineapple and like guava, you should be good.<br /><br />: they're a snack, not a meal. 45 calories and 1 serving of fruit pretty much says it here. There's not a lot in there, but if you want portion control and/or just enough to satisfy a nagging sweet tooth, these are perfect.<br /><br />: they're very friendly to special dietary needs. Vegan, kosher/parve, raw, gluten-free, and free of peanut/tree nut allergens. This is a huge selling point for some folks, and an easy way to please my celiac friends.<br /><br />: they're addictive. I have these on a subscription, because it's far cheaper than buying them at the local health store individually.<br /><br />If I had to list cons, I'd list these:<br /><br />: as noted, I sometimes get a twinge of guilt at the packaging waste. As far as I can tell, the packaging isn't recyclable (though it *is* minimal).<br /><br />: I'd love the guava flavor to be a touch more prominent, but I also love them as-is.

review/summary: Tastes like Pink Grapefruit
review/text: I read the reviews that said this was sweet or too sweet.. I thought, this is for me, I love SWEET! It tastes like grapefruit not pineapple. It's a little tart(sour) and left a taste in my mouth something like you would get from lemons.. I wouldn't order this again. Next time I'll order apple as this only has 45 calories and a little package was filling. Yes, I did finish it so it wasn't that bad but it certainly wasn't sugary tasting..

It has no added sugars, preservatives or anything... only ingredients is fruit!<br /><br />I find them too sweet for my taste, but like I said, my daughter gobbles them down.  With it being pure fruit I am happy!<br /><br />Plus these are Hungry Girl approved!!!

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: I ordered this hoping to get a satisfying fruit snack that was both healthy and delicious. It was a little disappointing. Each packet--though supposedly a serving size of fruit--is in actuality only about one ring of dried pineapple, if that, broken into pieces. I could've done without the added supposed guava flavor--it didn't do anything for the snack. The dehydrated pineapple pieces are basically only flavored by what seems like a dusting of the flavoring fruit--so there's some alteration on the pineapple flavor, but is neither here nor there.<br />It is sweet (almost too sweet) and without added sugars may indeed satisfy some people's (very small...)sweet tooth. Personally, I'd go with bigger size servings--not to mention that it is a waste of resources and energy for packing 5-6 pieces of dried pineapple in each--the rest is air... It is edible, but more much beyond that.<br />I will stick with dried pineapple, non-sweetened, and unsulfured, from the healthfood store.

review/summary: okay
review/text: I bought these to pack in my pre-school daughter's lunch to try to add some variety to her gluten-free diet. She tried one bite of the Pink Pineapple flavor and refused to eat any more. I've tried mixing the pineapple bits in with other types of fruit for her, but she still picks these out and leaves them. The texture of the pineapple has more of a crunch than other types of freeze-dried fruit we've tried. I like them myself, but I think the crunch is what makes my daughter stay away.

review/summary: Works well converting regular recipes to GF recipes
review/text: Learning to cook GF has been a big adjustment.  It takes time and patience to find solutions that work.  With my wife as a Celiac it has required diligent searching for good options.  On a recent trip to Utah we picked up several New Grains GF breads and found them the best GF breads we have ever had.  I decided to pick up some of this flour and use it to see how baking some of our favorite recipes would turn out.<br /><br />The flour works well as a GF substitute for regular baking flour.  I've used it in many recipes and have been happy with the results.  As is typical for GF cooking, there's a little less of a rise in the cooking process.  I'll upload a picture from a recent Pineapple Upside down cake we cooked in a 12" Dutch oven that turned out really great as a GF desert.<br /><br />5 stars, we love having a GF flour to cook and bake with.

When I had the chance to get these from Amazon Vine program I had to try them.

review/text: This review will be rather short, since there's not a lot to say. Overall, cookies are good. Being organic is a huge bonus!  After having several people try them, including my son who absolutely loves ginger, the conclusion was "too much ginger." It's potent.<br /><br />So if you love ginger, definitely give these a try. But don't expect it to be as mild as your typical ginger snaps.

review/summary: I loved these cookies -they were crisp, and very gingery.
review/text: If you are a fan of ginger snaps then I believe you owe it to yourself to give these a try.<br /><br />I love ginger, and I thought these were really authentic -they really tasted like ginger, and not a watered down cookie with a bunch of other ingredients that made it taste more like a shortbread cookie with ginger flavoring...<br /><br />These cookies are completely organic, which made me feel even better about eating them.  (I mean, they are still cookies, but at least I can avoid some of the ingredients that don't add value to my health.)<br /><br />They had bits of crystalized ginger in them, and they tasted slightly spicy (because of the ginger) and, best of all, they snapped when I broke them.  So, they had ginger, and they definitely had SNAP: the best of both worlds!<br /><br />Recommended to those who want a more traditional ginger snap cookie, and who like cooking with fresh ginger root.

review/summary: A ginger cookie not all will enjoy.
review/text: I enjoy eating ginger flavored things, and ginger snaps are no exception. This review will not take into account that these are vegan cookies, as I rarely eat vegan cookies, so I can't really compare that aspect to anything else.<br /><br />These cookies are hard, but I didn't find them too hard that they were inedible. They also have a strong ginger taste. It's incredibly intense, and these cookies are not that sweet. I personally thought they were slightly too strong. I plan to have these with some tea, as it will infuse the tea with ginger and make the cookies softer.<br /><br />If you are looking for an intense ginger snap cookie, then definitely try these.

review/summary: I couldn't give them away
review/text: Wow, was I disappointed with these cookies!  I love ginger so I was really looking forward to a cookie that other reviewers referred to as spicy.  Well, yes, these cookies are spicy if you can actually chew them.  The bag I got was filled with cookies that were hard as rocks.  They were impossible to eat without ripping the roof of your mouth to shreds.  The first one I tried I actually had to spit out!  I thought that perhaps it was just a bad one and that maybe the other cookies would be different.  Let me say that they at least have solid quality control at the factory because they were all hard as rocks.  I even tapped one repeatedly really hard on the table and but it had no effect: it didn't break, crack, crumble or even shed a crumb or two - it was absolutely intact.  Try that with any other cookie!<br /><br />Our yard is filled with squirrels and sometimes I put out food for them, so I tossed one of these cookies out in the yard four months ago and it's still there!  Seriously.  It looks exactly like it did when I threw it out there!  Usually I have to hide sweet things in my house or my twenty year old nephew eats them, but I left these out on the counter and after trying one he's never gone back for another... that's never happened before. I ended up throwing them away because no one wanted them.<br /><br />I don't know how my experience can be so different from so many other reviewers - perhaps I got a bad bag.  I'm certainly not going to waste money on another bag to find out.

review/summary: Tastes okay, but oddly inconsistent texture
review/text: I'll preface this review by stating that I think Newman's Own Newman-O cookies are better than Oreos.<br /><br />That's why I was a bit disappointed with Newman's Own's ginger snaps.  The flavor was okay, but I would have preferred a bit more ginger flavor.  My real issue is that within the same bag, I had some cookies that were crisp (as one would expect from a ginger "snap") and others that were more like a soft molasses cookie.  Not that I mind soft cookies, but it just seemed odd to not know what I was going to get when I pulled the next cookie out of this bag.  Seems like a quality control issue to me.<br /><br />I didn't feel ill after eating any of these cookies so I assume there wasn't really anything wrong with them, but I don't think I've ever bought any other brand of cookie where the quality in the same bag varied so widely.

review/text: These cookies are my new guilty pleasure - worth every calorie. I had to order a case after trying the first sample bag. I just can't stop nibbling away at these cookies. They are absolutely addictive.<br /><br />They are very crisp and a bit hard, so if your teeth are sensitive, plan on dunking these in your favorite beverage. The ginger taste is pungent, quite strong. They are loaded with tiny dried bits of candied ginger that turn chewy in your mouth. The ginger flavor is so intense - not for the faint at heart - that my mouth actually tingles with that "ginger burn" I enjoy so much.<br /><br />So if you like mild, boring, blah-tasting grocery chain wafers, stay away from these. But if your taste buds are ready for a wake up call, then these organic cookies are just the ticket.

Perhaps it is because most people have become accustomed to ginger snaps that don't actually have any ginger in them.<br /><br />Just like it's hard to find "Ginger Ale" with real ginger anymore, it's hard to find a ginger snap with that authentic, bite you back, spice.<br /><br />Everyone in my house likes real ginger ale, and a couple of us love it. It fell down the same lines as to who liked these cookies, and who loved them.<br /><br />Great ginger bite, not too sweet, nice molasses flavor.

review/text: First impression, very firm, dense texture, almost "shred the roof of your mouth" sharp when you bite into it.<br />The initial taste isn't horrible, it's when the very bitter aftertaste kicks in that you start feeling like you want to turn off your taste buds.<br /><br />I had hopes for this product, that it didn't even come close to filling.<br />With a name like "Newman's" I was expecting a high quality, tasty, organic, product.<br />It might be organic, but tasty and hiqh quality don't apply in this case.<br /><br />Even my grandson tried one (almost 4 years old) if you have ever been around toddlers or preschoolers, it would be rare to find one that would say "NO" to a second cookie. However, my grandson didn't care for the taste of the cookie either, and he actually really likes Ginger Snaps!<br />When offered a second one of these cookies, he backed away from me and told me "NO".<br /><br />This has left me with most of the bag of cookies, and a new inside, family joke, "be good or I will give you a cookie", because nobody in my family would try more then one other than me, and that was purely for research purposes on my part, since I did not like the taste.

My 8 year old refused to swallow and my 2 year old made the worst face, spit it out and said, "no more cookie." I found them to be too crisp and very bland, reminiscent of cardboard. Yes I said cardboard. These are what I imagine cardboard to taste like. My grandmother loves sweets, but rarely buys them so she welcomes all treats. She didn't care for these and refused the bag. My hubby wouldn't try them after hearing our negative reviews and stuck w pie. These were the first sweet treat that I ever had to throw away.

review/text: I don't believe I would order these cookies again, but they were ok, just not a re-buy for me. Like typical ginger snap cookies they were hard, dry, and crunchy; however, the real ginger pieces had a slightly moist and chewy texture. The ginger flavor was quite strong and fairly natural tasting. I thought the cookies bordered on being overcooked and had a slightly bitter flavor. If what I have described sounds like something that you would like then these are for you! I like the flavor and consistent texture of regular grocery store ginger snaps better.

review/summary: Good Taste, Bad Texture
review/text: These Ginger Snaps are made with organic flour and organic sugar, and are also vegan.  The ingredient list is pleasantly short and includes both candied and ground ginger.  I suspect the combination of the two types of ginger is why the cookies have such a strong bite.  These are not a mild cookie; they are very spicy and delicious.  Five cookies contain only 130 calories, and because of their kick, I only ate one or two cookies at a time.  This makes them a pretty low calorie snack.  My only real complaint about the cookies was the texture.  I like either a moist, soft cookie or one that is crisp and a little brittle.  Unfortunately, these were hard and chewy, almost as if they were stale.  I definitely wouldn't serve them to anyone who didn't have strong teeth.

review/summary: Bit overdone, but good, and lasts
review/text: As someone who likes organic products and gingersnaps, I was intrigued by this product. First off, let me point out that these are NOT your mother's gingersnap cookies. They are very clearly something that came from a factory and were mass-produced, and when I first tried them after opening the bag, they were very tough to chew, pretty dry. I would have a drink with them, especially since they were a lot spicier than other gingersnap cookies I've had. They do, however, keep VERY well, despite not being loaded with preservatives. Just roll up the bag and they'll stay good for several days at least, after which point I actually found them more enjoyable as they'd softened slightly.<br /><br />All-in-all, not the greatest store-bought cookie I've ever had, but if you are into organic products and like gingersnaps, these are definitely worth giving a try.

review/summary: Has a lot of Ginger Flavor!!
review/text: I really like Ginger snap cookies, but these ones have almost a sharp ginger tone to it.  It's a very small, hard, crunchy cookie.  You have to bite down pretty hard to crunch it.  Then there is a burst of sharp ginger flavor as you chew on the little bits of ginger in the cookie.  The little bits of ginger do get a little gummy like and can get stuck in your teeth.  This cookie definitely packs a punch.  If you like a sharp ginger cookie and you don't mind if the cookies are hard, then this is the cookie for you.  If you like soft, moist, chewy cookies, then you won't like this.  If you're used to generic store-bought ginger snaps, then the strong ginger flavor in this cookie may surprise you.  I think this is a quality cookie and I don't feel guilty at all snacking on them.

review/summary: More tasty snacks form Newman's Own
review/text: If you like ginger, you are going to love these cookies.  They are made with real candied ginger and - true to Newman's Own mantra - they are made with more than 70% organic ingredients.  There are no hydrogenated fats, no fake colors or flavors, and they are totally vegan (no dairy/no eggs were used in this production of these cookies).<br /><br />Really scrummy cookies for the ginger fan.  Pick up a bag to pack in someone's lunch, take on the airplane for a snack, or just to have with a glass of milk.

review/summary: Definitely a grown-up cookie!
review/text: These cookies are delicious!  Definitely for a more sophisticate palate, as they are very crunchy, and their flavor is rich, with a true ginger flavor.  The flavor really evolves from the first bite until after you've swallowed the last bit.  They leave your mouth with an almost spicy feeling.  You will likely not overindulge and eat the whole bag all at once, but you will enjoy every bite!

review/summary: Very gingery, very crunchy
review/text: Ginger snaps:  The name says it all, you want ginger and you want snap.  These have the ginger for sure, with a lingering burn in the throat.  And they sure have snap, they're very crunchy.<br /><br />I'm taking a point off because I think they go overboard on both accounts.  The lingering burn seems a bit excessive, although some might really enjoy it.  But the crunch really seems like a flaw, these cookies are bordering on hard.<br /><br />I still ate the whole bag though.  :)

review/text: How do you review ginger snaps?  Start with these are really good.  Not so hard they break your teeth like some, not so bland you wonder why you're eating them.  All in all these are an excellent addition to the Newman's Own food group.  The ginger snaps had just the right amount of bite and residual taste.<br /><br />While its hard for many of us to pay a premium price for something as trivial as ginger snaps, these are worth it.  Highly recommend

review/text: I generally enjoy ginger cookies but these were not to my liking.  The ginger was very strong which is probably a plus to some people but I prefer a more subtle flavor.  The biggest problem was they were incredibly hard (break-a-tooth hard) and seemed a bit burnt.  My daughter (age 21) also tried them and thought they were awful.

review/summary: Crunchy Snaps
review/text: It's not a failing of these ginger snap but man are they crunchy.  Do not eat if you have loose dental work. ;-)  They also have quite a sharp giner taste so if you like that then you will be in good shape.  But do not expect a sweet taste - it really is a strong ginger taste instead - not unlike Buffalo Rock ginger ale.  It's difficult to compare since ginger snaps are not an every day type of snack for most people (or me at least) but these do seem to be a quality product and worth a try.

review/summary: Snappy, Gingery... harsh.
review/text: Standard disclaimer: Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps were obtained via the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />Ok, my wife and I tried these ginger snaps and came to the same conclusion:  They're spicy and hard.<br /><br />The ginger is pronounced.  REALLY pronounced.  You have to eat this with a cup of tea or a glass of milk to cut the sharpness.  Another reason to have liquids on hand: these little suckers are HARD.  Serious crunch going on here.  However, a dunk in the aforementioned tea will soften them right up.<br /><br />I dig ginger snaps with a hot cup of tea, so you'd think these would be right up my alley.  BUT, the spice is a touch too harsh and the hardness of the cookie takes a serious dunk to get over.  Still, I can deal. Especially on a cold day.<br /><br />However, if you're looking for a snack cookie you can munch right out of the bag, these are NOT for you.

review/summary: gingerbread in a crunchy cookie
review/text: This cookie offers the American version of gingerbread (i.e., the flavor of mixed spices and molasses including enough ginger to impart a mild bite) in a crunchy form.  It uses a mild-flavored molasses which does not overpower the spices.<br /><br />If you like gingerbread in a small, crunchy bite-sized format, you will love this cookie.  Personally I prefer Newman's Own ginger oreos for crunchy ginger, and I would have liked this cookie to be in a soft-bake format.

review/summary: Just the Right Size Bite
review/text: Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps are just the right size bite for a quick treat.  What I love about these ginger snaps is that they are crispy without being overly hard. I've had too many other brands of ginger snaps that take the "snap" concept too far and that crunch like a brick.  These are NOT those ginger snaps.  They are nice and crisp with a satisfying crunch.  They are loaded without ginger flavor without being too powerful or sharply ginger.  In other words they are almost the perfect bite.  Another plus is that they go very well with my favorite cup of tea.

review/text: I like Newman's brand snacks and dressings so I tried these.  A nice little snack sized snap. They are crunchy and you definitely taste the ginger.  There is also an unexpected pepper taste - the "snap".  I didn't fall in love with these, but they were good.  My husband tried them and felt the same.  Good, but not great.  I appreciate that they are organic.  The packaging would keep them fresh for a long time.

review/summary: snap
review/text: Newman's Own Organics Ginger snaps really do snap. I very much like the flavor with a nice hot ginger taste as you chew them. What I don't like is that they are very hard and require some very good teeth to bite them. It's impossible for me to bite them in half with my front teeth. Perhaps this is the way that ginger snaps should be but they are not necessarily for me. I am a fan of many of the Newman's products. It's hard to recommend or not recommend a product which is really in the mouth of the beholder so I will not recommend them or pan them.

review/summary: Beats Nabisco in a Taste Test
review/text: Yep, I did a blindfold taste test.  I got the Newman's Ginger Snaps, placed them aside, and went to the store and bought Nabisco Ginger Snaps.  I did NOT open either package.  I had my wife open the packages.  She broke the cookies into bite size, handed them to me and I did 5 separate taste tests.  Of course, I had my glass of milk to complete the full test.  She mixed them up, different  brand in different order.  It would have been a better test if I could have gotten a third brand......could not find one.  The words that I used to describe Nabisco (as it turned out) Ginger Snaps were subtle, and  chewy.  The words that I used to describe Newman's Ginger Snaps were more vibrant, more ginger taste, crunchier, and more ginger flavor.  Across the board....all 5 times.....I rated the Newman's Ginger Snaps superior to the Nabisco brand.  I cannot compare against any other brand.  Seems I like the Newman's Ginger Snaps.<br /><br />I have never actually done a taste test without kinda knowing the end result.  In this case, I swear that I never opened the boxes.  I had no idea what they looked like, so I really was doing this taste test thing for real.  I like Ginger Snaps....have not bought them for years......my kids don't really like them.  But they are all in college, so I can now buy things I want to eat.  I like Ginger Snaps.......with a tall glass of milk.<br /><br />I actually like both brands, but I give the Newman's Ginger Snaps points for being more what I THINK a Ginger Snap should taste like.<br /><br />Hope this helps.  Good eats.

review/text: These snaps are just the right size because a moderate calorie count lets you eat six in a portion.

review/text: I'll start with positive (always the best, right?).  My husband LOVES these cookies, seriously loves them.  I can tell you that I dislike them for the same reason he loves them so this cookie with be a love it or hate it kind of thing.  These are no kidding Ginger snaps.  No fake stuff here.  It is flavored with real ginger, to the point that there are even little bits of candied ginger in the cookies.  This is what my husband loves about them, the extra zip every time you bite into that bit of ginger and chew on it (it is big enough that you do chew on it).  I do not like that zip from the chunks of ginger, I couldn't finish the first cookie I ate out of the bag.  My husband happily finished off the entire bag in 2 days.<br /><br />Bottom line... if you love ginger and things that have a little bit of bite to it then you will love these ginger snaps.  They are worth trying and I absolutely LOVE the Newman's brand.  (especially the marinara sauce.. just sayin')

review/text: These cookies are very good, but I'd only recommend them if you really love ginger snaps, because they go all out to be authentic. The ginger taste is very strong and the cookies are actually spicy, with a strong ginger aftertaste. They're also quite hard! If you like authentic ginger snaps, definitely give these a try. I'm not a huge fan of this type of cookie so for me they were just okay, but I can see how they'd be a huge hit with people who love ginger snaps. The ingredients are remarkably natural and not a huge list of unrecognizable chemicals. The bag is easily resealable, plus it's a generous size. Check these out if you like your ginger snaps very gingery and very snappy!

review/text: Crystallized ginger is eaten like candy in my house, so you can better believe I was thrilled to see these cookies.  The individual cookies are not overly large, which is a good thing since they are packed with real bits of crystallized ginger, giving them a slightly spicy zing.  If the cookies were bigger it might be too much.  They are crunchy, but not to the point that they crack and crumble everywhere.  I tried them with hot coffee as well as cold milk and they went well with both.

review/summary: Perfect ginger bite, but too dense and hard (except for dunking)
review/text: First off, the flavor of these cookies is excellent. TheY really have that spicy fresh/candied ginger bite. Unfortunately, the overall texture and density of the cookie doesn't do justice to the flavor.<br /><br />The cookies are very hard and dense, much like peppernuts. But they're too big to get away with it like peppernuts do. So instead they just seem too hard and kind of stale.<br /><br />I did like that there wee lots of funny odd-shaped cookies, not all perfectly uniform factory specimens. I don't know whether mine weree flawed or this was by design, but I thought it charming.<br /><br />If you're going to crush these for a recipe, for instance, pumpkin pie crust, they would be outstanding. They're also great dunking cookies for tea and coffee--here the hardness really works. But on their own, they just come off as stale, dry cookies with a great ginger kick.

review/text: Well, these didn't last long around the house.  Nor did I get to sample all of them despite the fact that I, and not my wife and son, am the reviewer around here.  Suffice to say that these were a big hit. They've got a strong ginger bite to them, so you don't want ginger taste in your ginger snaps, these aren't the cookies for you. But if you like ginger, they're great.  They are very crunchy, so again, if you like soft, not the ones for you. But if you like snappy, they're great.  They aren't at all too sweet, which is often a complaint of mine with regard to cookies and snacks.  And did I mention they're very gingery? Linger in your mouth, flavor-pop gingery. the all-organic is an obvious plus.  The package comes with a bit of tape to help you reseal it once you've opened it. To be honest, it won't get much use--once you open it, they'll pretty much be gone.  Highly recommended.

review/text: This review is for Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps, Family Recipe Cookies.<br />These ginger snaps taste good.  The cookies are about 1.25" in diameter.  The right amount of ginger and the right amount of sweet.  Although some cookies are crunchy and slightly hard, and others are slightly more chewy possibly due to a larger percentage of molasses in individual cookies.  The bag has a resealable tape to seal the bag, yet it is not as effective as a zip lock, but it works. I prefer another brand of organic and natural ginger snaps over these cookies, but these are still quite good.

review/summary: Fantastic Ginger Snaps!
review/text: I have to admit, I love ginger snaps.  To be fair, I love anything ginger.  Ginger slices with sushi, pure ginger ale, gingerbread, even the mixed drink 'Dark & Stormy' which has rum and pure ginger brew in it.  I love the bite & spice of ginger, so use that knowledge as a precursor for this review :)<br /><br />I love Newman's products as a whole because of the natural ingredients his company has always used, long before the recent fad of organic and 'going green' food products had come along.  These organic gingersnaps fit right in with his other food products in that the ingredient list is short, all natural, and delicious.  The cookies themselves are crunchy and have actual pieces of ginger in them.  And you can DEFINITELY taste the whole ginger.  There is serious bite to these cookies (which I personally love)  Myself and my boyfriend took out half a bag together with no problem over coffee on a Sunday morning (this was purely unintentional to have cookies for breakfast, but hey, these things happen)<br /><br />Being autumn, these perfectly compliment this cool time of year and are perfectly paired with coffee or hot cider.  I highly recommend them if you are a serious ginger foods lover!

review/text: I like this company and was predisposed to loving these cookies, but they were simply not gingery enough for me.<br />The texture was excellent, but the flavor was bland.

review/summary: Snappy and Tasty
review/text: I loved these cookies.  I will have to put them high up in the cupboard to ration myself because I could easily eat the whole bag in one sitting.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />*Crispy, snappy texture<br />*Strong ginger flavor<br />*Over 70% of the ingredients are organic<br />*Ingredients list is pretty basic--NO mysterious chemical names strung together for 10 lines<br />*5 cookies for 130 calories -- decent bang for the caloric buck<br />*2% Calcium and 1% Protein, which is pretty decent for a cookie<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />*Strong ginger flavor may not appeal to all<br />*May not meet the threshold for those that need a low-fat cookie<br /><br />Summary:  Great tasting cookie with crunch.  I'll be looking for these my next shopping trip.

review/summary: The Tasty, Crunchy,  Zing of Fresh Ginger
review/text: Gingersnap lovers (like me), will be delighted with these organic, bite-sized cookies which are packed with the flavorful zing of fresh ginger.<br /><br />Each little cookie (about half-dollar size) is a crunchy (VERY crunchy) mouthful of sweet candied ginger, molasses, with a hint of peppery fresh ginger. About as authentic as gingersnap taste gets, unless the cookie is homemade!<br /><br />Serving size is 5 cookies (at 130 calories), and even though the cookies are small, 5 are plenty per serving, since the flavor is so intense.<br /><br />My family loved them, and I'll certainly buy them in the future!

review/summary: Little bites of delight
review/text: I was glad to see a new product in the Newman's Own line, and hooray, hooray, this one is vegan.  I love Newman's Ginger O's, so I wanted to try the ginger snaps.<br /><br />The little foil bag is filled with cookies that are about the size of a quarter, which you think would make it easy to overindulge, but each bite-size cookie packs a gingery zip, so definitely best not to overindulge.  It's made with candied ginger and powdered ginger, along with molasses, an absolute must in any ginger cookie (at least in my opinion).  I found them very tasty and crunchy (maybe because it's hard to reseal the bag properly) and I definitely recommend them to anyone who loves a real ginger cookie.

review/summary: Good if you like ginger (a lot)
review/text: I love the taste and smell of ginger, and I really love ginger snaps. These ginger snaps definitely have some real bite to them and a good kick of ginger. You can actually see the crystallized ginger pieces in the cookies. I don't do the whole organic thing, so these are a bit pricey, but they are good.

review/summary: Tastes like homemade
review/text: I've been a baker since childhood.  The first cookie I ever made was the Tollhouse chocolate chip cookie.  I've also made ginger snaps before and while mine are considerably larger than these quarter-size snaps the taste is similar.  Full-bodied spices, sweet, but not too sweet, and crisp.  In other words, these cookies pass the 'homemade' taste test.  The ones I received were also a little burnt on the bottom, which I kind of like.  To each his/her own.  So, I like my ginger snaps a little burnt on the bottom.  Don't judge me! :o)

review/summary: VERY crunchy ginger snaps
review/text: I really like these ginger snap cookies, but they may not be for everyone. They have a strong ginger flavor, however a little light on any cinnamon/nutmeg flavor. They are thicker than the gingersnaps I ate as a kid, but I personally like the meatier, thicker cookie because it gives the cookie a strong crispy, crunch that goes extremely well with my morning hot tea or coffee.

review/summary: Very good.  Strong fresh ginger flavor.
review/text: These cookies are very crispy with a very strong, fresh ginger taste.  Some may think the ginger is overly strong but I love ginger so I really enjoyed them.  The ginger has an aromatic flavor like that of fresh ginger.  Very good ginger snaps.

review/summary: Tasty Rocks
review/text: I received this package from the Amazon Vine program.  I ordered it because I've always loved gingersnaps, and I've felt that Paul Newman baked good products are generally a step or two above the rest of the offerings on the baked goods' shelf.  The bag of cookies was small, but packed full of flavor.  I love gingersnaps which have candied ginger in them.  The little bits of ginger kind of stick to my teeth and they leave a deliciously peppery bite after I've swallowed the cookie.  It's hard to find potent gingersnaps, and Paul Newman seems to have answered my desire for flavor.  However, these cookies are dangerously hard for my teeth.  On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being soft like a Lofthouse iced cookie and 10 being harder than a pretzel rod, this cookie is probably an 11 or 12.  In order to bite into one of the cookies, I had to line the cookie up with an incisor tooth and crunch down hard on it. Having just broken out a filling in a molar by biting down on a large mint Life-Saver, I am more careful with the texture of things I am eating. I learned to eat these gingersnaps after dunking each cookie in a cup of hot coffee for a second.  The actual cookies appeared to be burned on the bottom, but there was no burned flavor from the very dark color. I would recommend this cookie to people with strong teeth, but not for people who wear braces, have crowns or bridges, or weakened tooth enamel.
