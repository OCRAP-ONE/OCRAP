review/text: It takes a little getting used to, its tart, but this pure form of cranberry is what they are talking about when they tell you to drink the juice.<br /><br />At first, try it is tea, but eventually, you will just want to put a little in a glass of cold water.  Delicious.

review/summary: The best cranberry concentrate!
review/text: I've tried other cranberry concentrates and they were far inferior to this product.<br /><br />First, the bottle is very well made. It is quality plastic, not too thick, not too thin, not too rigid, not too flexible. It pours exact amounts easily without dripping, and, of course, it's recyclable.<br /><br />Next, the juice is completely homogenized...no sludge or separation the entire time I used the solution.<br /><br />Third, the taste is just as you would expect from unsweetened unadulterated cranberry concentrate. It's sour and very cranberry!<br />I drink it mixed with water and ice during the day, usually once a day. In the evening, I have one or two cups hot mixed with an herbal zinger tea and a packet of sweetener.<br /><br />I gave up beer because of some 'fluffy' tummy changes...Cranberry Concentrate prepared as above is a perfect substitute for me!

review/summary: OH! Powerful Candy!
review/text: Super Lemon candy is a marvelous treat for the sour candy lover!  It starts out with a shock of sour, then soothes into sweet lemony flavor, much like a lemon drop.  The packaging promises a sour center, but it is more like a Warhead, in that, it has the sour exterior with the sweet ending.  The retro packaging is wonderfully attractive with the dot press style, showcasing the shock of your first taste.  I paid $4.25 in store for one bag, so anything near that price (don't forget to check shipping) is most likely the best you can find.

review/summary: Great taste and quality
review/text: Numi brand of honeybush tea is delicious and of a good quality. By the way, this is not a true tea from the Camellia sinensis plant, but rather a tisane, or herbal tea; in this case from the honeybush plant. There is no caffeine. Drinking it plain without anything added, the taste is very similar to regular tea (Camellia) that has a touch of honey added to it. If the bag is left in to brew for longer than five minutes, it does not become bitter. It makes a great iced tea, too. Just add honey and lemon -Delicious!<br />The quality is very good, too. The taste is full and rich, and the leaves don't leak through the bag very much. I've tried other brands that have a weaker taste and leave a lot of residue in the drink. It is organic and Fair Labor. It costs more than other brands of honeybush, but is worth it for the quality you get.

review/summary: Very smooth rendering of Honeybush Tea
review/text: I discovered honeybush tea several years ago, and it is a favorite for that late-night warm up drink since it is caffeine free.  Several makers produce honeybush, but this one is the best I have tried so far.  Sometimes other makers turn out a tea that is slightly bitter or astringent.  This has a smooth, mellow, light honey and light floral flavor that is easy on the nose and palate.  Just a touch of creamer and I'm good to go, no sweetener needed or desired.<br /><br />Like rooibos, honeybush is full of antioxidants.  But the flavor is smoother and cleaner than most rooibos teas, so I am now dropping my periodic purchases of rooibos.<br /><br />I am pleased to see that Numi is supporting sustainable harvesting of honeybush.  This genus has been pressured in its natural habitats, enough so that I would not make the switch from rooibos without these efforts.  I am also pretty happy that Amazon is offering this three-box pack at such a great price!

review/summary: good herbal tea without the usual yucky herbal taste
review/text: I was 1st introduced to Numi teas when I was drawn to the artistic, beautiful packaging of Numi's rooibos tea (the version with the artistic drawing of elephants in an african savannah) at Safeway supermarket as I needed a small food item but that had an expensive-look to serve as a "community" gift for everyday munching or drinking for coworkers at work for our small kitchen/computer/lunchroom at a prestigious company. After finding their rooibos tea so wonderfully tasting as well as relaxing to my nerves as I get anxious and nervous, rooibos tea has been my #1 breakfast tea to drink in the morning.<br /><br />Their rooibos is much milder than you find with the more affordable Twinings tea but rooibos tastes a little nutty and you don't need sugar since it has a very mildly sweet taste. I, however, will also add organic raw honey to it to give me the benefits not only of the herb but also the benefits of the organic unprocessed honey which makes it a complete healthful breakfast tea for me.<br /><br />There's a VERY TINY cut in the corner to indicate where to rip the teabag package but what I don't like about Numi teas is sometimes, the cut is not there and so that same small paper-plastic packaging that holds each tea bag is difficult to open OR when you rip it at the cut end, the rip still doesn't result in the opening of the tea bag pkg - it's protective with tough plastic on the inside and you NEED scissors or else you won't be able to open it unless you're Superman.<br /><br />But what i love about their teas is that, like another reviewer posted, they don't taste like the usual flowery herbs (like licorice, flowery herbs/roots/leaves, mint, hibiscus, rosehips, etc.) which is what i hate about Celestial Seasonings Tea and why i moved away from Twinings blackcurrant tea when they changed the formula. So you get the benefit of the herb in the tea without the yucky flowery herbal tastes/flavors.

review/summary: be aware: they downgraded when they changed packaging :(
review/text: Sadly, this is no longer the super-premium jerky that it used to be. Granted, if you're used to grocery-store jerky, then this is still a much better product. But if you've acclimated to chemical-free jerky, then the "smoke flavoring" that they've recently started adding tastes like, well, smoke flavoring, and not the real thing.<br /><br />You may not notice a difference. Apparently jerky is one of those things where you notice a down-shift in flavor, even when you wouldn't notice an up-shift in flavor. (Like margarine eaters think butter tastes fine, and powdered milk drinkers think cartoned milk tastes fine, but when people do the opposite, they find the tastes terrible. Jerky is the same--if you upgrade from convenience store jerky to premium you might not notice it, but when you downgrade from "the real thing" to anything else, it tastes distinctly artificial.)<br /><br />I used to buy this in bulk every few months (with a discount per Amazon Subscribe & Save), but the change in flavor made me double-check the ingredients list, and I found that the new "smoke flavoring" was added when they changed packaging. So this jerky is good, but not worth the premium any more. If anyone has a suggestion for an all-natural replacement without ingredients like "smoke flavoring" I'd appreciate it, since I'm now searching for something new.

review/summary: Best Beef Jerky -- EVER!
review/text: I am utterly amazed. I had no idea beef jerky could be so good!. I purchased the Teriyaki flavored. The taste is great. It taste so pure. It's neither dry nor too oily. I feel good knowing the cattle are fed sweet grass that is also organic! All of the ingredients used to make the teriyaki sauce are also organic.<br /><br />Here is the list of ingredients:<br />Organic Beef, Water, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Soy Sauce (Water, Organic Soybeans, Salt, Organic Alcohol) Organic Pineapple Juice Concentrate, Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, Sea Salt, Organic Paprika, Natural Smoke Flavoring, Organic Black Pepper, Organic Onion Powder, Organic Garlic Powder.<br /><br />Best if consumed within three days after opening.<br />Allergen Declaration: Contains Soy Ingredients<br /><br />Also worth mentioning:<br />Gluten Free<br />Organic beef raised without added hormones and without antibiotics<br />Beef raised on organic feed<br />Cattle are never fed animal by-products<br />No artificial ingredients, no added MSG (Monosodium Glutamate)<br />No preservatives, No nitrite, No erythorbate<br /><br />High Protein/Low Fat - This is a snack I can enjoy, guilt free!<br /><br />The meat was mostly very tender. There was one or two pieces with gristle in them, but this IS beef jerky, after all. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Awesome Organic MSG and Gluten free!! Reasonable price!!
review/text: I have bought this product several times now. It's a great healthy snack for my kids, one of whom does not tolerate gluten. I could not find a single super-market brand that was free of both gluten and MSG. These bags are 3oz and most of the "regular" jerkey bags in the stores are around 3.75 oz. In my stores, the bags are usually around $5, maybe $4 if you're lucky, and with Amazon's average pricing on this it comes out to be about $5.50 a bag. So a little bit smaller and a little bit more pricey but I think it's WELL worth it for organic beef with no MSG, not to mention the perk of no gluten that is necesary for so many these days. Next time I'm going to try the BBQ flavor. The Teriyaki is great for us but very mild, so depending on what you are looking for if you want a big flavor punch you may want to try a different flavor.

review/text: I have been receiving this jerky via subscribe and save for a long time now.  I just opened the second pouch out of my last order and there is mold on the jerky!  The sell by date is 8/28/13.  The first pouch I opened out of this case was fine.  I went to return it, but it is not eligible for return!  Needless to say, I will be canceling my subscription to this product and looking for another.  This is too expensive to risk waste because of mold.

review/summary: May have MSG in it!!!
review/text: This jerky may contain MSG.  .  The ketchup they use has "spices" and "natural flavoring" in it which<br />is code for MSG.  Check out Dr. Russell Blaylock's vidoes on youtube re: the DANGER of MSG.  And the over 30 names used in food products to hide the fact that there is MSG<br />in it.  It says "no ADDED MSG" which just means they didn't add any themselves, but it in no way means they don't use ingredients which already have MSG in them.

review/summary: Great snack for growing kids!
review/text: I have started keeping this on hand for a "grab & go" snack that is also healthy for growing kids.  We take a couple bags to the park along with some apples and coconut flakes to refuel after an afternoon of play.  I also send a bag with my teens when they go on a sleepover or trip. Having some non-refrigerated protein available seems to help them keep up their energy better than the greasy, salty or sugary snacks that are usually available.  It is a pricey snack compared to the typical processed options, however, it is also real food and I'd much rather skimp on the chips and soda and spend our money on solid snacks that benefit growing bodies!

review/summary: Beats all other jerky except homemade
review/text: This is by far the best jerky I have had.  I ordered the black pepper and it isn't that hot at all.  The best thing is the low sodium, you barely taste any salt.  And it is low carb, 5g, which comes from sugar, but it does not taste sweet.  It is a soft jerky compared to those brittle brands and chews nicely.  Wow, I've got to put another piece in my mouth.<br /><br />UPDATE:  About a week ago I opened a pouch and only ate a piece or two.  Today, while sitting in my semi-dark office, I opened the pouch and ate a piece.  Before my next piece I looked inside the bag and all I saw was white....all covered in mold.  Thankfully I only ate one piece....so far so good.<br /><br />I guess the rule is that once you open a pouch, eat it right away.

review/summary: Way too sweet and reconstituted texture
review/text: I would give this really a 1.5 star, but I was generous. It is way too sweet. Others have said the same in their reviews, but I ignored them to my chagrin. It is very very thin and has a texture and appearance like it has been reconstituted and highly processed. Because it is so thin, there are never any big lumps of gristle, but sometimes you can tell the meat quality as a bit off in some pieces. The worst problem is the overly sweet flavor, the second problem is the texture and meat quality. This is not a very good jerky. Their Buffalo, while also too sweet, is much better as is their Turkey. They are much much less expensive than a really premium jerky like those from Mountain America, so it is a toss up. For the price, I may re-order the Turkey and perhaps Buffalo, but I will never order this Beef again.

review/text: Jerky is expensive, but it's a great snack.  My wife and I are striving to eat grass-fed, natural beef, and this is the best option we have found to have a handy snack nearby.  The jerky is very good, but not great.  It's better than Jack's Links or Oberto, but this pales in comparison to the jerky you can get at most meat markets.  This is probably the best option unless you can make the jerky yourself.

At first I thought they sent me teriyaki by mistake, but no, it's the original recipe. To me, if the organic beef is so great, you don't need to cover it up with a bunch of sweetness. I want to taste the meat, not the evaporated cane juice. I hate to give this product a bad review as it's just my personal taste. It's not a bad product--it's completely organic with no nitrites. It's tender. It just tastes like a meat lollipop.

When I looked inside all of the meat was covered in mold. The date on the packaging for expiration was mid December 2012, no where near the date. Good thing I didn't eat a piece!

review/summary: PERFECT JERKEY
review/text: When Trader Joe's stop selling organic peppered jerky I was very disappointed but thanks to Amazon I'm back in Jerky Heaven! The peppered beef Jerky is awesome, a little sweet on the first bite but then the pepper kicks in and its explodes with a good old jerky flavor and a hot bite thats leaves you wanting more. This is quality Jerky that is cheaper than buying in the stores if you sign up for the delivery plan.

review/summary: Great jerky, not too sweet
review/text: I really like jerky, and I love this stuff.  It is expensive, but it also doesn't have a huge list of chemicals like the non-organic brands.  It is a bit more tender than I am used to, but it really is good (and I have been buying the convenience store jerky my whole life).  Some reviews say it is too sweet.  It is a touch sweet, but I really don't think it is "too sweet."<br /><br />I just bought my second batch of 8 pouches, this new order is for Teriyaki.

review/summary: decent, not great
review/text: This jerky is very moist, so moist in fact that I might not even call it jerky. It has the texture kind of like those beef-flavored dog treats you get. Flavor is OK, but nothing special. I could almost go so far as to call it "bland", but that would only be in comparison to other jerkies I have eaten. I prefer a drier, more flavorful jerky -- the kind you have to chew for a while and exercise your jaw muscles. This jerky requires minimal effort to chew before it disintegrates. I like the organic-ness of it, and the ingredient list is devoid of anything scary. All-in-all, it's decent, but I might not buy this particular flavor again.

review/text: A friend got me hooked on this beef jerkey- gluten free, cheaper than Trader Joe's and organic. I get the "ORIGINAL" TYPE - it is not too spicy, not too sweet and not too salty! And no MSG! Also, it isn't too chewy which can be a problem since my husband had jaw surgery. We take this on flights, car trips and snowboarding and it travels wonderfully. When you order it, it will arrive immediately....I am always shocked how fast it gets to my house.

review/summary: Disgusting
review/text: This is by far one of the worst beef jerky I've EVER tried. I bought this because of all the positive reviews but remarkably, the other one star review is most accurate. It boggles my mind how this product is so loved. I was so excited thinking I found the perfect jerky: organic, reasonably priced. So what's wrong with it: Mainly the taste. It has almost no flavor other than meat. Although it's organic it, has the texture and taste of being highly processed. Again, I don't mind that if it tasted good - it doesn't! And the after taste is -- ugghghhh!!! get the mouthwash! like roadkill exploded in my mouth.<br /><br />So I ended up spending over $40 and got 8 bags of which I couldn't finish even one. I tried to find a way to use it somehow, I tried deep-frying it, only intensified the horrible taste - this time more chemical like, I think it may have been the preservatives. I'm tossing them all out. Don't buy this.<br /><br />PS: I purchased this from Amazon but "verified purchase" is not showing up for some reason.

review/summary: Excellent non-dairy egg replacement
review/text: I've been using this egg replacer for over a decade. First as a vegan and now just because I have a few friends allergic to eggs and it is easy to keep on hand. I prefer to use it in muffin, pancake and cake recipes that call for egg. I've used it both as instructed (combine with water first) and I've just sifted it with my dry ingredients and obtained excellent results. If you have a recipe for vegan cupcakes for example that tend to crumble, just add 1.5 teaspoons to the dry ingredients in your recipe and this just might fix the problem! Recently I found out that I have Celiacs and so I've also been using the egg replacer in gluten free recipes, also with excellent results!

review/summary: Better than eggs in baking for many reasons: ease, money, safety, etc.
review/text: I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  Not just because I am allergic to egg yolks and this magic mix has me baking again, but because I cannot tell the difference between the egg-full and egg-free versions in baked goods.  My hubby, who is not allergic to yolks, was my judge can and attest to that by gobbling up everything I make -- and he is a picky eater.<br /><br />I have used this in muffins, quick breads, pancakes, waffles, sponge cakes, boxed mixes, pound cake, cookies, scones, etc.  All have turned out great!<br /><br />-- I just mix the required dry amount into my dry ingredients and add the water to the wet mixture before I combine them and it is very easy to use<br />-- I feel good using it around my tiny daughter because if she licks the beater or bowl, there is no threat of Semonilla poisoning<br />-- You get 113 servings in one box for $4.41, that is just .47 cents for a DOZEN egg-equivalent - this makes baking much more economical<br />-- It is a painless way to bake vegan for the family members we have who follow that lifestyle<br /><br />The one thing it doesn't do is add protein.  If I am making breakfast muffins and want protein in them I will blend a scoop or two of unflavored whey protein powder ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MAK59O">100% Pure Whey Protein Isolate (Natural) Unflavored (Mega Pack) 10 lbs</a> ) with the wet ingredients with no extra water, it works perfectly.  I do not do that when baking vegan or if there are milk allergies.<br /><br />I am so glad amazon sells this in bulk, it is half the price of what the grocery store charges and it is brought to my door -- can't beat that!

review/summary: Good for egg allergy people...
review/text: My husband's deathly allergic to eggs.  After using a baking cookbook that excludes eggs, I decided I wanted to give this a try.  Overall, it is pretty good.  Basically you mix some in a separate bowl with the recommended amount of hot water.  And be sure to thoroughly mix so no lumps remain.  I left lumps once and it ended up in the muffin and the lumpy spot tasted odd.  Other than that, follow the instructions exactly and you get a powdery-smelling egg substitute.  I used it in Betty Crocker muffin mixes and it turns out just fine!  (Blueberry, choc. chip, etc)  I tried it in a Betty Crocker brownie mix and I had to throw the entire thing out, it never thickened and was a gloppy mess.  So for that recipe the eggs needed to be actual eggs!<br /><br />So if you want to do a quick boxed treat and can't use eggs for allergy/cholesterol reasons, I'd say try it.  On the back of the box there's recipes for many different foods.  I haven't tried them though.  It's not perfect but it's good in this world of egg-laden foods.

review/summary: I LOVE this product!!
review/text: As an avid vegan at-home baker, I use egg-replacer constantly. There are so many things you can do with this product. It works amazing in cookies (I usually add an extra eggs-worth than what the recipe calls for), it is perfect in pancakes and waffles, and anything, like a previous writer mentioned, that doesn't need to rise too much. On the other hand, you can make whipped cream with it and a slew of other things. However, this product has its limitations (most instances where you need eggs in baking it should work just fine). Recipes it is perfect for: cookies that call for whole eggs or egg whites (use flax and water instead for egg yolks or agar-agar in gelatinizing projects), whipped cream, pancakes/waffles, cookie bars, and virtually anything that calls for eggs (mind you its a POWDER, and cannot be used to eat by itself). You can use this product in quick breads, cakes, and muffins, however I usually avoid this and stick with the flax/water combo or applesauce, bananas, etc. depending on the recipe when making these things. Egg Replacer just doesn't have the eggy consistency of ground flax, and the fluffing power that normal eggs do. Also, you can use it as an egg wash, but it will not brown, it will just be shiny. If you want your bread for example to brown and look shiny and golden, I would try super-finely ground flax and water. Most importantly, this will absolutely NOT work in brownies or boxed mixes. Just don't do it. Trust me, I recently had a fiasco with some home-made brownies. If you are doing brownies, again, go with flax. It has to do with the low protein content of Egg Replacer, but I won't bore you with those details. Wow, I may seem like I don't love this product but it's actually one of the best out there and a MUST for anyone's kitchen. Why have all the cholesterol from eggs when you can use this in place of eggs for most recipes? And just because I personally choose to use flax in quick bread/cake/muffin recipes, doesn't mean it won't work for them. I've used Egg Replacer to make these things before ( I just have personal preferences ) and it worked just fine. There are only a few things that I wouldn't recommend using it in as mentioned above, but other than that it is fabulous!!!!!!!!

review/summary: works great for cookies
review/text: I have experimented with this in all kinds of recipes for homemade baked goods.  I've never tried it in boxed mixes.  It doesn't work for everything, but cookies & pancakes/waffles seem to have the most success.  The less something has to rise, the better it works.  It is similar to eggs in that it binds ingredients together, but it doesn't have the "fluffing" power of eggs.  For most cookie recipes I use an extra eggs-worth of the replacer.  The cookies will be more crumbly than those made with eggs too.  As for using in pancakes, you can't tell the difference & I just mix the dry powder in with the dry ingred.  Using this in homemade brownies results in a pan full of something that resembles a super oily sponge.  Carrot cake also has the same result.  Cakes in general do not rise well & do not have a good texture.  I have made the banana bread recipe on the box & it is good.  Not as good as my regular egg recipe, but it tastes good, although it doesn't rise as high.  I haven't tried it in meatloaf since I use sour cream in place of the eggs.  As for substituting with sour cream, my most successful egg replacer cookies have been recipes that have sour cream in them.

review/summary: Simply the best way to eliminate eggs from baking.
review/text: I have been using this product religiously for the past decade, after becoming a vegan and experimenting with flax seed goop, pureed silken tofu, mashed bananas--all of the egg replacement staples.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why so many vegans dislike this product.  It's always turned out perfect baked goods for me, in both taste and texture, is inexpensive, and doesn't lend the icky flavor of flax or silken tofu to your baked goods. It's just neutral, and helps the baked good bind and rise, as egg would.  I've made everything from brownies to decadent cakes to cookies to muffins to airy fluffy biscuits with this, and it's all been highly praised (often without realizing the goods are vegan) by omnivore, egg-eating relatives and friends who have begged me for years to open my own bakery.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the general complaints I hear all too frequently are about.  As I hope I've made clear, this product works perfectly for me.  Here are some of my tips for using this product: 1) use a liquid that's already in the recipe (eg soymilk) to blend your powder. 2) always always ALWAYS do your best to get all of the lumps out of your liquid+powder mixture.  I blend mine in a small bowl or ramekin (depending how much Ener-G Egg Replacer I'm using) with a fork or tiny single egg beater.  If the mixture still has tons of lumps, it's not going to do its job.  But when it doesn't have lumps, it works perfectly!  3) I always use about one egg's worth more of Ener-G than the recipe calls for. Just to be safe.  4) Consider adding about a half tablespoon per egg replaced of oil to make up for the lost fat content.<br /><br />Good luck, and please give this product a try!  It's truly excellent.

review/summary: Not just for vegans and people with allergies!  This product has NUMEROUS benefits!
review/text: My husband has high cholesterol and I found this product years back and thought it'd be great for egg-free baking.  At first I assumed that it'd be a mediocre product that would cause baked goods to lose taste and texture, but I haven't found that to be true at all.  Not only that, it's made from decent ingredients.  This product is not difficult to use and isn't messy.<br /><br />I've used this in making breads, cookies, cakes, etc.  I've even successfully used this in gluten free concoctions.  I seriously haven't noticed anything lacking in my baked goods.<br /><br />Besides the health benefits, this stuff is REALLY cost effective.  It's quite a bit cheaper than using fresh eggs.  You won't have to find yourself borrowing eggs from a neighbor because you've realized that you're short an egg or two after you've already started a recipe.  Being that my children (including my 24 month old) like to help me bake, I don't have to worry about them getting sick if they happened to get batter into their mouths.  I don't feel that I need to disinfect my floor or counter when the batter makes a mess.<br /><br />This has definitely become a staple in my home.  I don't know what I'd do without it!

Obviously, you can't make omelets with it, but I've used it succesfully in pancakes, waffles, box mixes, and many of my homemade recipes. It hasn't failed me yet.<br /><br />This egg replacer is vegan, so I can use this instead of eggs for vegan friends. Also, there have been many occasions when I've run out of eggs and this egg replacer has saved the day. It's very easy to use, just mix with warm water. Many suggestions for optimizing effectiveness are included on the box.

review/summary: You can eat the batter!!!
review/text: I love this product.  I went vegan a couple years ago, for many reasons but mostly to help combat high cholesterol.  After only a few months my cholesterol was lower by almost 100!!  and I never had to stop eating delicious baked goods. I've used this in pancakes, breads, cookies, muffins, brownies - and no one can tell the difference.  For the person who had bad results with a boxed Betty Crocker recipe - maybe making them from scrach would yield better results (??) and would probably be healthier too!  I've never had a problem with something not setting up.<br /><br />Oh yeah - and my sons favorite thing....you can eat the batter and I don't have to worry about Salmonella.  Also, eggs expire so fast (this product has a 3 year shelf life!!) and are more costly.  One box of this is equivalent to 100 eggs.

review/summary: Unbeatable price!
review/text: If you do "from scratch" allergy-free baking then this is a great deal! I've been using this product since 2002 and have steadily seen the price rise over the years. ENER-G Egg Replacer is a great baking substitute when you can't use eggs at all, it binds and acts as a leavening agent to help baked goods rise. I received 4 boxes for $15.00 from Amazon. In the stores this retails locally for $5.75 a box. Thanks again Amazon for making gluten-free baking affordable!

review/summary: Vegan Kosher Gluten Free Choice
review/text: Vegan. Kosher parve. Gluten free. Wheat free. No preservatives. No artificial flavoring. 113 egg equivalents [9+ dozen] per box. Only 15 calories per egg equivalent. Good for general baking and to make pancakes, waffles, etc. Useful for any vegan pantry and for many different recipes. Easy to use. I use a small short clear glass for preparing. Add 1.5 teaspoons [4g] of the powdered egg replacer along with two tablespoons [30ml] of warm water in the glass for each egg equivalent. Stir well. Then add to batter, or recipe as called for. A carton of almond milk (or soy milk) is the vegan compliment for any milk substitution as needed. Long shelf life. [The boxes I received were dated to 2014.] The Ener-G company makes a large number of vegan products and publishes a complete list on their website. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.
