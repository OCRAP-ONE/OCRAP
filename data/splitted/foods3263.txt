review/summary: This is the best stuff on earth!
review/text: My roommate brought it back from Costa Rica and I have been addicted ever since.  It has a very smokey flavor that goes well with everything....  and I do mean everything.  The other reviewer was right, it's great on mac and cheese, as well as on eggs, salads, pasta...  It's basically replaced ketchup in our house...  You have to buy it...  and take my word for it: buy more than one bottle!

review/summary: A Good Criollo Sauce-a-Like
review/text: Finally got to try the Lizano Sauce.  I hadn't wanted to pay the shipping cost which was almost as much as the product itself, but finally did.  It reminds me a lot of Criollo Marinade, but without as much citrus flavor.  Cumin is the predominate flavor, which I love, and it is slightly sweet, which I normally do not like.  I am a "keep-the-sweet-off-the-meat" kind of person for the most part with some exceptions. However, I may try marinating some bird in this for the grill which I think will work well flavor wise; savory taste of the char from the grill with the subtle sweet background and a good comino pop.<br /><br />I did try it over some posole and it was a good complement.  You will have to make your own judgement if you have not had it before, but it will be interesting to experiment with beef and fish dishes as well as chicken.

review/summary: Awesome sauce, shipping too high.
review/text: Guess you're kind of stuck when you don't have any decent ethnic food stores in the area that carries a good selection of products like this.  The price on this was really good (just over $7.00 for 24-oz bottle) but they charged $6.60 to ship it.  It doesn't weigh that much.

review/summary: Lizano Salsa is a bit of Costa Rica in the US
review/text: Having never tasted Lizano until traveling to Costa Rica the 1st time, our family  has a yen for this wonderful addition to rice, eggs, meats and veggies.  We can't go long without having some of this wonderful stuff.  As for the cost, it is much cheaper in Costa Rica, but think how much it would cost to go there to buy it, which I would love to do, but can't.  So due to the fact it is made in Central America and shipped to the US, it is a bargain, especially when you can't get it just anywhere.

review/summary: Not as good...
review/text: I found about this sauce here [...] because I was looking<br />for some great BBQ sauce and this product showed up. I read all of<br />the great reviews and I was planing to add it to marinate my Christmas<br />Turkey but after tasting it...I will not be doing that. This sauce was<br />disappointing. It wasn't as delicious as people say it is. I'll tell<br />you...it tastes kind of like Pico Pica salsa only Pico Pica tastes much<br />better and is much cheaper and you can pick up a bottle of Pico Pica Hot Sauce and Mild sauce at many stores and here on Amazon. So...just to<br />describe the taste...it tastes like a little Pico Pica and some other<br />cheap mild Mexican hot sauce only it's not that great. But...I have<br />yet to try it on any foods yet but I will since I paid for one bottle.<br />Buy a Pico Pica Mild sauce. That tastes 5 times better and is only like<br />$2.95 or less.

review/summary: Try Nature's Recipe--excellent for skin allergies!
review/text: Since dogs are omnivores, like people, and can eat plants & animals they should be able to eat almost anything, right? NOT! Too much inbreeding has changed their systems, and now some breeds are developing inherent abnormalities (like frequent deafness in Dalmations).<br /><br />Similarly, not all breeds have evolved to handle some diets equally well, and the rise in allergies in pets attests to that. With veterinary advice, we tried several different specialty foods (all natural without preservatives, Iams, Science Diet, etc.) and none cured our dogs' skin problems long term. I wanted to avoid preservatives like ethoxyquin, BHA and BHT, plus artificial colorings, and my reading suggested they might contribute to some skin allergies too.<br /><br />After much trial and error we discovered Nature's Recipe, and have been so impressed with the results. Our toy poodle's hot spots disappeared, she quit the obsessive licking (no longer itching), and has enjoyed the food and remained vibrant and healthy eating only Nature's Recipe Vegetarian Canine Allergy Formula.  We use the dry food with canned food mixed in occasionally.  We noticed another possible bonus: her dark "tear stains" disappeared (I think due to no coloring agents) and her white fur is beautiful again.<br /><br />Dogs' stomachs can be sensitive, so allow your dog some time to adjust to the new diet gradually by incorporating it with your present food, a little at a time, and I hope you'll be as impressed as we are! (P.S. Watch the ingredients in your dog snacks too--or you'll defeat this food's effects. Take time to read the labels. Carrots are a great lo-cal but chewy reward too.) AND go to the Amazon listing for larger 37.5 lb. bag to read the more detailed Product Description info.

review/summary: My dog LOVES it
review/text: I have a 10 year old chihuahua who weighs around 10 lbs at the most. I have mostly fed her Mighty Dog in the can. She recently had to have almost all of her teeth extracted except for 2. She had a hard time eating the Mighty Dog because it is all chunked together like Spam. Even when I mashed it up, she had trouble eating it and scraping it out of her bowl.<br /><br />I started feeding her Pedigree Senior in the pouches, lamb and rice. She likes it and where it had a little gravy in it it made it easier for her to eat.<br /><br />I changed it up for her and got this new "flavor" and I swear that within 30 seconds she ate the whole pouch. She loves it. She gets one pouch a day and that's plenty for her.<br /><br />The only negative is that this new flavor gives her diarhea really bad. Maybe she will get accustomed to it but not even the other pouches of Pedigree have given her diarhea before. After a month if it doesn't stop, I'll just go back to lamb and rice flavor but she LOVES the taste of this food.

review/summary: Vegetarian Sloppy Joes
review/text: My older brothers and sisters went to Cedar Lake and they used to have this wonderful sloppy joe mix, well the one I remember was possibly a dry mix.<br /><br />This is a good sloppy joe with some playing with it.<br /><br />When first opened it sure looked like alpo dog food.<br /><br />But, mixing it with a can of dark red kidney beans, some tomato sauce, -chunky tomatoes are optional, or a red pasta sauce makes a wonderful meal better served in a bowl.<br /><br />Also chopping onions, garlic, chives into it is good.<br /><br />I like it with some cheese..  Has enough to eat several days.<br /><br />Its a little bit more like Chili than it is sloppy joes.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

I can make 1 glass last a whole day. I make it very hot in the morning and just sip it. Eventually I add an ice cube. Oh by the way I start with 3 heaping tablespoons so when I add the ice it doesn't water it down. Later in the day I switch to iced coffee so I add sugar lots of ice and some water. Believe it or not it still tastes great. By the time I finish this it is almost dinner time. I want to make another glass but I have a hard time finding mocha decaf.<br />You're probably not going to read all this but it is why I like it 4 stars and not 5.<br />  see ya

review/summary: Great Soy Sauce
review/text: This Soy Sauce was recommended by a popular food magazine as a top pick. I found that the magazine tasters were right. This is much better the the standard brands found at most stores. If you use it as a table condiment this is the right size to purchase. If, however, you wish to use it in cooking, purchase the larger size bottles.

review/text: This is pretty good soy sauce. Our Meijers recently started carrying this. So I wanted to try it. It is much better than kikkoman soy sauce. I have several recipes that give soy sauce as an alternative ingredient. I must say using this in those recipes made it so much better! I also put a squirt in my ramen or udon noodles. YUM!!!!

review/summary: Fabulous tea at a great price!
review/text: The best green tea I've had, and at such a good price!  I thought $25 for the same size package was a good deal until I saw this.  I've seen the same size pack go for $40 at a local shop.  The flavor is very floral with no bitterness at all unless you overbrew it.<br />The tea is fascinating to watch when it brews.  The 'pearls' will unroll into little branches, which are the tender shoots of the tea plant.  Because the tea shoots are large, there is no need for an infuser since they stay at the bottom of the cup.  In fact, the metal of the infuser can give the delicatley flavored tea a funny metallic taste.  So I don't reccommend using a metal infuser, if you are squeamish about seeing your tea leaves at the bottom of the cup, go for a nice ceramic infuser.  They make teacups with a built in ceramic strainer, one of those would be ideal for this tea.<br />One caution: it is done when it TASTES done, even if it doesn't LOOK done.  It's a very pale colored brew.  I live at 6500 feet in elevation, and I usually have to boil the water to get it to brew to the proper strength within ten minutes because of the lower boiling point.  At sea level, use almost boiling water.  The directions say brew time is 90 seconds or less, but it usually takes three to five minutes depending on how strong you like it.

review/text: Company shipped and charged account after cancellation for starters. This product can be used as a cooking sauce but not as an added ingredient because it is mostly water and vinegar. It does not even come close to Lea and Perrins and French brands. To me, it is a diluted mixture that is supposed to be worcestershire sauce but just does not get even close. I wasted my money. I will never buy from these people again.<br />I gave it one star because I had to check something. It isn't worth any stars.

review/summary: Just like mom used to make.....
review/text: Having bought into the whole 'Campbells Chicken Noodle' gig since I was a kid, the first time my mom bought me this soup, I ignored it....until one day when I was sick and desperate. Wow! I found it to be a really good soup.<br /><br />The broth is flavorful (but not oily or too rich, either- definitely not watery like certain other canned soups available..), the vegetables are great additions, and the chicken and noodles are very similar to the way my mother used to make them. The noodles were large and firm- unlike some of the soggier canned ones I encountered in my childhood.<br /><br />One thing I really detest is finding pieces of fat in my soup-  the chicken in Progresso's Chicken Noodle Soup is always lean, and the soup has no need to be strained. No fat at all that I could see or taste!<br /><br />It's probably been about 6 years since my mom first bought me this brand of soup- and it's been a consistantly excellent product. Calorically and gastronomically two thumbs up!!

review/text: This kit comes with everything that you will need including the corks and labels.  Following the directions I was able to create a wine that is very tasty.  It is slightly dry and the flavor hits the tongue with a pleasant and slightly fruity flavor.  The dryness of this wine disappears quickly after you swallow.  This is an excellent wine for meals and should make a very good sangria when combined with fruit and a hot summer afternoon.

review/summary: Vino Italiano Wine Kit - Montepulciano
review/text: I have just started my 15th kit so my experience level is getting up there.  I've done kits from a couple of other companies; Wine Expert, and Vino Vida.  I've bought kits from other online companies, from a local brew hut, and from Amazon.  I'll continue to buy these kits so long as they are selling them at this value.<br /><br />You cannot beat the Vino Italiano Kits.  They are complete with everything, delivered to your door with free shipping, and they make a really good wine.  Let me back up and say first that a wine I like may not be good to someone else.  We each have our own preferences.  I've had many a wine served up at restaurants with price ranges of $10 to $100 a bottle.  And the wine I am making now I like better than pretty much anything I've tasted from the restaurant, or the store.<br /><br />I have tried the Valpolicella, Shiraz, Reisling and the Montepulciano from Vino Italiano.  I have made a couple merlots, some white zinfandels also, but from other companies.  I prefer the reds, and made the others because my kids requested.<br /><br />I'll typically, but not always, spike the kit with additional sugar to up the alcohol content slightly.  If you follow the instructions, the initial specific gravity comes out around 1.080-1.084.  By adding a couple pounds of sugar in the form of corn syrup or simple syrup, you get to around 1.09 or better.  That usually will give a final ABV of 11.5 - 12%.  Other things that I do outside of the kit instructions include adding 1 cup of black oak chips, 1-2 tbsp of vanilla extract, and a lb or two of some black cherries, blue berries or black berries (found in the frozen foods section at the store).  Lastly, I like my wine not so dry, so I'll back sweeten just as I am bottling.  Again using corn syrup and usually between 8 - 16 oz per 6 gallons.  To me the corn syrup seems to be better than simple syrup, but that's just my preference.<br /><br />I love the stuff.  Currently my production is having a hard time keeping up with my consumption.  Cheers.

review/summary: Jury is out. NOTE- YOU NEED EQUIPMENT TO BREW THIS
review/text: This is my second Vino Italiano wine kit. The first was a Cabernet Savignon. I had read reviews of that variety and I ended up making 5 gallons instead of the 6 that the kit calls for. Other reviewers had complained that the Cab was too watery. My adjustment worked out well for the Cab, but for this wine I probably should have bottled the full 6 gallons. Instead, I ended up brewing about 5.2 gallons. The finished wine is very dry and almost has an acetone flavor to it (that's a whole other issue for wine makers and I'm concerned that it might actually be ethyl acetate, but it's hard to tell. It might just be overly acidic due to the high concentration). When I add water to the wine (equal to approx 1/5 the volume of the wine) it mellows out a bit. Other than modifying the total amount of must during primary fermentation, I stuck to the recipe.<br /><br />For the price, it'll be a decent wine if it mellows out a bit in the bottle. As of bottling the wine is highly acidic (but, again, that's probably due to the higher concentration); it has a nice deep rich burgundy color; it's crystal clear with no signs of oxidation or residual sediment. I did not filter but I carefully racked during the final stage to ensure that no sediment made it into the bottles. The jury is still out on this wine, but, overall, I'm still a fan of the Vino Italiano kits. You can't beat the price.<br /><br />Oh, and if you're new to making wine from kits- this kit only includes the ingredients (grape concentrate, additives, plus corks, labels and shrink wrap closures) to make the wine. You will still need to invest another $70, or more, in the wine-making equipment. You will need: A 7 gallon Primary fermenter, 6 gallon carboy, siphon hoses, hydrometer, wine thief, container to hold wine during testing; 30 wine bottles (bottles you drank already work fine, mostly, if sterile and clean); an air lock (inexpensive); sterilizer (campden tablets or "Easy Clean"); a bottle filler (recommended and also cheap) hand corker and, preferably, a brew belt (to maintain proper temperature during primary fermentation). Visit your local home brew shop and they'll show you what you need. Or, visit midwestsupplies.com for mail order supplies. Their prices are competitive. So far I've done 3 kits, made Sangria wine from organic Concord grape juice, and now I'm working on some Cab Sav from juice I picked up at a local vineyard. BEWARE: this is addictive and can be both frustrating and incredibly rewarding. Good luck!<br /><br /> P.S. Of the three kits I've done, I've been most happy with the Vintner's Reserve World Vineyard Collection California Red Zinfandel/Shiraz at $80.00. At that price it works out to about $2.75 a bottle (not counting initial equipment costs). So if you're contemplating spending a little extra for a "nicer" kit, I say go for it.

review/summary: Two months after bottling..... and then 12.
review/text: Purchased this kit and mostly followed directions, main deviations were to allow more time in primary and secondary. Added a little Hungarian oak early on. Let it age two months after stabilizing then filtered and bottled. Opened the first bottle two months later.<br /><br />Nice little wine, good bouquet, quite smooth. bright flavor, not a whole lot of body. I expect the flavor to develop with a little more aging but after about 4 months in the bottle (two more to wait)I won't expect additional improvement.<br /><br />I thought the wine was quite nice, a very pleasant drinking wine. I'll buy more of their kits, at this price point they are a good value.<br />Several friends have purchased other kits from this vendor with no complaints.<br /><br />Been in the bottle about a year now, nice little wine that is enjoyable fairly early - aging hasn't helped that much. Guess I better drink the other bottles. Have made several other kits with favorable results, good dependable house wine.

Did add extra sugar for a little more kick, added dark oak cubes and a little vanilla for the primary ferment.

review/text: The flavor is just OK. I get a hint of some fruitiness once it hits the tongue, but it disappears and tastes a little bland right after. It's also a little sweet for my taste, compared to other red table wines I've had. It almost seems more like a ros&eacute; rather than a red (or maybe I didn't make it right). It's a cheap wine kit with free shipping so I went with it. I probably won't buy again. If I do, it might be to use it as a base and experiment with adding other flavors and oak to enhance it.

review/summary: CRUSHED Fritos
review/text: I am certain that these Chili Cheese Fritos would have been perfect if not for the UPS treatment of the box.  They arrived in a box that had been smashed and had holes in it.  Only a fair amount of packing tape held it together.  There were actually smashed fritos on my front step from the 5 or so bags of chips that exploded in its trip.  The remainder of the un-opened bags taste fine, albeit the fritos are noticably smaller.  It just wasn't worth complaining but since you asked....

review/summary: The Definitive Sports Snack
review/text: Big sporting events. . .I'm into them all.  Super Bowl.  BCS Championship.  March Madness.  NBA Finals.  The World Series.  Pay-Per-View Boxing.  Wimbledon. . . .not.  And when you're watching a bigtime sporting event, you need a bigtime snack with taste and crunch and texture to hold its own in all the excitement.  You need a bag (or more) of FRITOS CORN CHIPS.<br /><br />Just something about the original corn chip and sports.  They go together like bacon and eggs. . .salt and pepper. . .Ginger and Mary Ann.  Could be because FRITOS CORN CHIPS go great with brewskies--or pile them on top of a steaming bowl of chili.  Mmmm, now you're talkin' Super Meal.  And for dipping, nothing beats Fritos Scoopers (not available here, alas) into a bowl of Lay's Creamy Ranch Dip (also, alas, not available here).<br /><br />So bring on the playoffs; usher in the buzzer beaters; welcome the wild card.  As long as you have FRITOS CORN CHIPS, it's all good.  Your taste buds will score.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

review/text: I buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5388">Country Time Lemonade</a> for my kids to drink in the warm summer months in addition to water. One of the reasons I like this product it that it's easy to make - "just add water."  No looking for a measuring cup or spilling the sugar. There is a handy little scoop included and on the back it gives clear directions on how to mix anything from 1 cup to 2 quarts. For me it is a little sweet when mixed according to package so I tend to add a little water and ice to mine, but it is great on a summer day. I've been purchasing it using Subscribe & Save and find I pay much less than any local store.

review/summary: Awesome summertime drink
review/text: I began ordering this a couple of years ago on a different website for bulk foods. They charged over $20 for one cannister and that didn't include shipping. I found this on the Amazon website and have never looked back. I found it for a better price and its a twofer. Who could ask for more? I have never had a problem with the auto-ship as my family prefers this over the kool-aid and tang I also buy from this website. The product arrives in great condition, it isn't clumpy as you would expect from being exposed to heat or cold when shipping. It keeps well and I don't think the cannister it comes in is bulky at all. But then again I do all bulk shopping since there are 5 of us in my household. The instructions for mixing are clearly printed on the label and a scoop in included in each cannister.

review/summary: Actually hot chocolate, not chocolate coffee
review/text: We love our Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffee machine, and received several  flavors to try out with it.  As mentioned in my review of the machine, we do not typically drink more than one cup of coffee per day.  However, we all love hot chocolate, and I was delighted to find this as one of the flavors to try.<br /><br />It seems a few reviewers are rating this as if it was chocolate flavored coffee, but it is not. Before getting our Dolce Gusto machine, we drank instant hot chocolate made with water.  No more, this product has knocked it out of the running!  While it is not the best hot chocolate I have ever had in my life, it is much better than the instant brand we have used for years.  It's rich, creamy and wonderful.

review/text: While the other Nescafe flavors seemed to be very rich and gourmet tasting, I felt this one needed to go back to the development lab.  To me, it tasted like powdered hot cocoa, and not a very good one at that.  I have tried adjusting the Choc/Milk ratio but didn't find a good taste.  It's a shame because NesCafe has such a good name in Europe where drinking Chocolate is held to a much higher standard than here in the US.  I expected a better product.

The flavor reminds you of typical hot chocolate with a little kick in it..not a straight, sweet hot chocolate...maybe like the difference between milk chocolate and dark chocolate. I liked it.

It is super easy with the machine, too. We will be buying more of these...

If you want more you can hit it with some chocolate syrup but it's a lot more rich than your typical hot chocolate.<br /><br />Again the price is steep, $1 a cup is hard to justify for a homemade drink.

review/text: I've tried all varieties of Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffee offerings, and this is by far my favorite. To be exact, it's not really even a coffee, more like a frothy hot chocolate drink. Once again, Nescafe has taken out all the guesswork with measuring and mixing - I found the capsules to be the perfect mix, no adjustments needed.<br /><br />Where the drink disappoints is with its nutrition info. Each serving (1 cocoa and 1 milk capsule) has 6 grams of fat and 19 grams of sugar - and it's very hard to drink just one! Perhaps Nescafe will come out with a light or sugar-free version in the future.

After that, I went back and read the leaflet, and it's not meant to be made cold.  Cocoa only!

review/summary: Least Favorite of the Nescafe Dolce Line
review/text: I love the speed and agility, as it were, of the Nescafe Dolce Gusto brewer. I accept the limitations as a trade-off for convenience. I do not like this flavor.<br /><br />Not every product can be translated into a single-cup device. In this case, the process for making the drink is the same for the other two-capsule drinks (cappuccino, latte machiatto and others). However, the goal here is to create a kind of frothy hot chocolate. It does that as it should. The problem is the taste.<br /><br />A good hot chocolate earns its designation by using good chocolate and good milk. This provided neither. It tastes artificial on every level.<br /><br />At least the coffee products they offer use real coffee. Those resemble more of a better version of a gas station cappuccino. The Chococino resembles hot chocolate made from Count Chocula cereal.<br /><br />--Brockeim

Personally, I feel it has a rich chocolate taste granted it is not as rich as a coffee house, but for something you brew at home it is really fantastic and has a lot more flavor than instant cocoa. I have to let consumers know this is hot chocolate and not mocha flavored coffee so if you are looking for mocha coffee you have the wrong flavor. I drink more coffee than I do hot chocolate but both me and my husband love this!

I have not idea exactly what that means (it says best by). So maybe it won't matter if we use it past the date of 7/12? The idea was to buy this many so that they would last a long time.  The taste of the hot chocolate is very good though.

Well worth getting! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI36">Nescafe Dolce Gusto for Nescafe Dolce Gusto Brewers, Chococino, 16-Count Capsules (Pack of 3)</a>
