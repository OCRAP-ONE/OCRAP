review/summary: best coconut oil -- in GLASS jars!!
review/text: I bought this from their online site last year.  It's a wonderful product.  I use it mainly for skin and hair.  Smells great like fresh coconuts. Not overly greasy like baby oil.  Solid at cooler temperatures so bring the jar in the bathroom with you so that it heats up after your shower and pour it into a squeeze bottle (ketchup bottles works well).  Apply after bathing like you would any bath oil.  My skin is moist and smells yummy.  Also can be used as anti-frizz hair serum.<br />I almost bought another brand on amazon because of free shipping, but glad I didn't because other brands come in plastic jars.  I think glass jars keeps better.  The oil I bought a year ago still smells the same.  And if you buy at their site, you'll sometimes come across special offers like buy one get one free.  Also, their site has interesting info such as why there's no such thing as extra virgin coconut oil.  I bought several jars and gave one to my mom and my best friend's mom.  That's how much I love this stuff.  Just bought 6 more jars today so I won't run out.  Planning to give away some jars to friends too.

review/summary: Gold Label Coconut Oil
review/text: This Gold Label coconut oil has a unique taste. Every other organic or natural coconut oil I've tried has a very light, clean taste of coconut with maybe a little sweetness to it. This Gold Label type has a stronger taste, and not one I associate with fresh coconut. It's OK for cooking meat or vegetables, but I would not use it for any foods where I wanted a sweet taste (like on a sweet potato or in a fruit pie). I'm kind of baffled by the Amazon reviews of this oil in the 32 oz size which say it's bland and doesn't have as much taste as other coconut oils. Less coconut taste maybe, but overall the flavor is stronger. To me anyway. It's possible that since the product is hand made, the flavor may not be consistent between batches. I'm on my second jar and the first jar was so strong I thought there might be something wrong with it.<br /><br />Gold Label Coconut Oil is made by a very unique process. Most other brands of organic coconut oil I've used have been cold expeller pressed in a machine that squeezes the oil from the coconut while controlling the temperature so it doesn't heat up and "cook" the oil. The Gold Label coconut oil is made by hand. From the Tropical Traditions website:<br /><br /> "The fresh coconut meat is shredded (wet milled), and then cold-pressed using the water from inside the coconuts to make coconut milk. The milk is then allowed to sit for about half a day, while the oil naturally separates from the heavier water. The oil is then filtered from the curds (coconut solids)."<br /><br />More info at the Tropical Traditions website at [...]<br /><br />I give this oil extra credit because it's a unique product -- I don't know of any other coconut oil being sold which is made by hand using traditional methods. But I don't think the flavor will be to everyone's taste.

review/summary: Tropical Traditions stuff is yummy!
review/text: A friend gave me a jar of the Tropical Traditions coconut oil and also a jar of their coconut cream concentrate because I have dairy allergies.  I just emailed her a huge thank you because both these products are good for replacing butter.  The coconut oil is just like white butter (less salty, slightly sweeter, slightly coconutty) and the cream concentrate has a layer of the "butter" on top and can be used to make coconut milk.  So now I have replaced two foods that I had to give up, milk and butter.  You may not be that interested if you don't have diet restrictions but if you do, try this company.

review/summary: This fit 70 year old male loves it!
review/text: I have been buying this by the quart directly from Tropical Traditions for years, waiting until it is on sale with free shipping and stocking up. We use it for cooking and as a skin moisturizer. We first began using it for popping Orville Redenbacher popcorn in a stir popper because it adds such a wonderful taste and smell to the popcorn and helps keep it crunchy. We sprinkle it with freshly ground pink Himalayan Sea Salt. It tastes wonderful, just the way movie theater popcorn used to when they popped it in coconut oil. We learned that coconut oil had wrongly gotten a bad rap for being a saturated fat, when it truth it is healthful, so I started finding more ways to use it. I like to make an oil saturated toast using a whole grain bread and browning it on both sides in a skillet - sometimes using olive oil instead or using a combination. It makes a quick, tasteful, and healthy appetite suppressant. The coconut oil makes it brown more evenly than olive oil as well as have a lighter coconutty taste. Sometimes I top it with a fried egg lightly cooked in the same oil. Recently I tried topping it with a dollop of strawberry preserves and topping that with a couple of tablespoons of chia seeds [which I recently learned are a "superfood" for health with calcium, fiber, and omega 3 fatty acids]. It was delicious and most nutritious! It also keeps the appetite at bay for several hours, which is just one more benefit. Have I mentioned that coconut oil does not turn rancid!<br /><br />It also makes a wonderful skin moisturizer and I use it daily. For convenience I transfer a portion of it into a small plastic screw cap container for the bathroom and take it with me when traveling. I daily put a small amount under my eyes to keep the skin smooth and wrinkle free. Whenever my skin feels dry and itchy, I apply a small amount and smooth it in and the itch is gone. Solves the problem! [My dermatologist recently said, "You look wonderful!" Then repeated it.] Life is good...<br /><br />This is my story and I'm sticking to it!

review/summary: This is the best coconut oil available
review/text: I have been using Tropical Traditions Coconut Oil for over ten years now. It is an amazing product and is great to cook with; it makes the very best scrambled eggs. I also use it as a skin oil when needed. Whe use it as the oil in our own homemade mayonause by mixing it 50/50 with olive oil. If I have eaten too lean in a day I'll take a table spoon or two to up my fat intake. The taste is very mild and clean. I generally buy it in 1 gallon tubs and then refill a one quart crock (with a lid) that sits out on the counter. It is available in 5 gallon buckets but I prefer the one gallon pails as you have sealed pails that will likely stay fresher longer.<br /><br />As an aside, for those who are concerned with survival or food storage, this makes an excellent addition to your storage plan. One of the hardest things to get in a disaster is adequate fat. Coconut oil is highly saturated, around 92%, and hence is very stable and has a long shelf life.<br /><br />I can't recomend this product highly enough.

As with vitamins, fish oil tablets, etc, it is very very hard for me to actually tell if a product does it`s job as described, but I consume only what I have researched by reputable reviews. It can`t hurt you I would assume. It does liquify. It doesn`t seem work well as only, cooking oil by itself, if a lot is needed to cook something. I have even added some to coffee. It doesn`t mix with it well. My only problem with this is remembering to use it, as I keep it in pantry or over stove cabinets. I did get the best product I could discern to be so. How it was made, where, etc.

review/text: I bought this coconut oil from the Tropical Traditions website.  I hated the smell and taste of it.  To me it tasted and smelled rancid, nothing like coconut.  I contacted the manufacturer and they told me that for some people it does smell and taste different but the oil was good.  I asked my mom if it smelled or tasted strange to her.  Surprised me when she said she loved how it smelled, very coconutty to her.  So I gave it to her.  I have used other virgin, unrefined coconut oils before and loved them all but this one just was horrible.  Maybe I have strange tastebuds.

review/summary: Unacceptable Change to Product
review/text: When I had heard enough about dogs getting sick or dying after eating Chinese chicken jerky, I went looking for products made in the US and found this and have ordered several 1 lb bags. When fewer and fewer vendors were listed on amazon and the price quadrupled from my last purchase, I called the manufacturer to see if they had stopped making the product. The person said no, they had reformulated it so I waited for that to show up. Now it has so I went back to the manufacturer's web site to see what they changed.<br /><br />I was appalled by what I found. From my bags of the old product here is a list of the ingredients. Chicken, natural smoke flavor. That's all.<br /><br />Here's the reformulated product ingredient list: Chicken, betaine, brown sugar, cultured dextrose, sea salt, natural smoke flavor, garlic powder, mixed tocopherols (preservative), paprika extract color, rosemary extract.<br /><br />I didn't know what betaine was so I looked it up on the net. After reading about it, I still don't know what it is.<br /><br />The crude protein dropped from 77% to 50%.<br />  crude fat increased from 2% to 5%.<br />  moisture increased from 18% to 28%.<br /><br />I am not going to give this product to my dog and will make my own chicken jerky in the oven.<br />___________________<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I just went to a new Petco that opened near me. I found a 1 lb package of Colorado Naturals Chicken Jerky Dog Treats. Made in the US.<br /><br />Ingredients: Chicken breasts, natural flavorings.<br /><br />Crude protein 70%<br />Crude fat 3-7%<br />Moisture 10%<br /><br />I will be buying these once I use up my old stock of True Chews.

review/summary: Best CandyBar ever?
review/text: What more can I say, this is the best candy bar I have ever had. Some have compared it to Butterfinger, but that's not a fair comparison, this is much much better.  Only downside is that it tends to crumble when trying to bite into it, so it's best to eat it over a napkin or plate so you can retrieve the pieces that "get away"  It reminds me of the Jerry Seinfeld episode where everyone started eating candy bars on a plate with a knife and fork.  Don't need a knife or fork with this, but a plate or something to catch the parts that crumble off (to avoid wasting them) is pretty much a necessity.  It is so good, that putting up with the crumbling isn't any kind of deterrent to enjoying this.

review/summary: Okay but irritated by claims of "no-drain" and portion size
review/text: Okay, to start:  This is acceptable packaged chicken.  It's no better or worse than canned chicken.  It may be a little less salty.  The chunks of this are much smaller than they usually are in canned chicken.  This had that sort of tough texture of old chicken.<br /><br />I bought this mainly because it seemed logical to get a product claiming 7 oz. "drain-free", rather than a can with a lot of wasted water and less ounces of actual chicken.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise upon opening the first pouch and finding several tablespoons worth of water inside.  This certainly needs to be drained.  If I had unknowingly just dumped this "no-drain" product into a recipe I was preparing, it might have ruined the dish, due to the amount of water it contains.  So:  It does NOT contain 7 ounces of chicken.  It contains probably 4-5 ounces of chicken and a couple of ounces of water.  Since fish packaged this way, such as salmon, doesn't contain excess water, I see no legitimate explanation for this other than fudging on the amount of actual chicken in the package.  When I looked at the ingredients list, it even lists "water"!  So on the front it claims "no-drain" but it lists water as an ingredient....<br /><br />The other thing that really irritated me was the ridiculous "serving size" claim.  Federal guidelines for meat like chicken list a serving size as 3 or 4 ounces.  This product claims it offers 3.5 servings.  Even if the package contained a full 7 ounces of chicken, that would still be a false claim; as it is, it's a ridiculous claim.<br /><br />What troubles me about these two issues is:  If the company has this kind of business ethic, how do I know that they bother with things such as, oh, like following sanitation laws?<br /><br />I would NOT purchase products from this company or manufacturer again.  We all have become jaded by the little cheats companies do, such as adding water to cans etc.; but two cheats of this nature, especially when you are featuring those aspects as a main selling point, is really unethical and concerning.<br /><br />Since the product itself isn't in any way superior to other canned chicken products anyway, and since you aren't really getting any more chicken here than you would elsewhere, there is no point even in selecting this over another product.

review/text: If you even like this product...the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top. I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking. It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't. With the sweetness of the fig, a bit more acidity would have balanced it out. I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable. I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help. It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months. I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain. I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste. Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store. I asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller. I can see why.

Well I finally remembered to check the ingredients on the bag this week. Boy was I shocked when I read the first ingredient now. It is no longer chicken on my bag. It is ground whole grain corn. Now if I wanted to feed them that I would buy the much cheaper dog food. So check your bags for the ingredients. I will no longer be using Science Diet.

This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  i would recommend going to [...] and compare brands and see what is right for you budget wise.

Never again will I subject a dog to overpriced, crappy food when you can get the good stuff for the same price or less. Even if you have to pay more for better food it works out cheaper because they'll have fewer health problems.

review/summary: Great Company with a Wonderful Product
review/text: I love finding new spices to play with in recipes and was excited when I came across this product.  In my family the love for the flavor of fennel has long been a favorite and I planned on giving a can of this to my father for Christmas. When it did not arrive on time due to an addressing error, Pollen Ranch very generously made up for the mistake by sending me a sample of their products. The evening the package arrived I made Chicken Piccata, adding the poultry blend to the flour (although just a tad because it does not take much). The flavor was subtle yet with marvelous savor and will now be a permanent addition to my recipe. The next day I made Spiced Muffins and added a bit of the Fennel Pollen to the streusel topping, which again, added a unique flavor that was alluring to the taste buds.  I have now tried the Fennel Pollen and Fennel Pollen Blends with a variety of recipes and loved the flavor they bring to everything I have cooked. Next on the menu is to create a fennel flavored chocolate truffle as a gift for my dad (it really is his favorite spice)- I imagine these will be wonderful as well. I encourage anyone looking to add another flavor dimension to their recipes to give the Fennel Pollen a try, I do not think you will be disappointed. And with the outstanding  service the the Pollen Ranch extends to its customers, I will be supporting their company as often as possible.

review/summary: Flavor find of the year
review/text: This summer a fellow gardener/foodie/food blogger made a tomato cobbler from cherry tomatoes from her garden. I was dazzled by the rich, sun-drenched flavor. One of the key seasonings was fennel pollen. I was hooked!<br /><br />Never had fennel before? You probably have and didn't know what it was. Fennel is the small ribbed seed that gives Italian sausage its unique flavor. Fresh fennel bulb (available in almost all groceries) is terrific added to marinara sauces where you need a little extra flavor. Fennel pollen, however, takes the flavor to a new level. Just a pinch added to dishes with pork, chicken or tomatoes gives you an deep rich taste of fennel. Fennel pollen pairs exceptionally well with hard Italian cheeses such as Romano or Parmesan, and with dishes made with dry red wines. I've really just begun to experiment with its uses. I'm sure it would be great in some Indian dishes and even tossed into scrambled eggs.<br /><br />Just keep in mind that the flavor of the pollen is much more concentrated than the seeds or the fresh bulbs. Start with just a pinch and taste before adding more. Nine dollars may seem like a lot of money for a tin of spice, but fennel pollen is so strong that this tin will last a long time. It's really a bargain when you consider how little you use.

review/summary: INCREDIBLE FLAVOR EXPERIENCE!
review/text: This new taste sensation is a wonderful addition to one's spice arsenal.  IMHO, it should be used as a dusting (like paprika might be used) just before serving for greatest flavor impact. It is subtle, ethereal, haunting.  I want to use it on everything!!! It tastes, to me, a little like fennel fronds, a little like curry, a little like flowers, but better than all three!  BTW, the supplier sent free samples of some of their other blends.  They were wonderful too.

review/summary: Love this
review/text: I became aware of this product from a Food Network show with Anne Burrell. She made a brined pork chop that is out of this world. The fennel pollen is amazing in this dish! Although a bit expensive, you don't need to use a lot and you will think you are eating in a top restaurant with this dish (make the sides; the Parmesan polenta featured with the chops on the web site is fantastic). I first bought this product here, but later found it at a local gourmet grocery store. They cut back on what they carry and I'm not sure I can still get it. I will order from Amazon again. Although this brand has other flavors, I haven't tried them. I like this pure fennel pollen so much I haven't wanted to try any other. I'm looking forward to warmer weather so that I can grill the pork chops with fennel pollen again.

review/text: This is amazing stuff. Buy it. Sniff it and think "it doesn't smell all that great," but trust that it'll taste a lot different when cooked. Use a pinch or so in red sauce or wherever you want a richer, more complex "Italian" taste. Taste the results. Make noises and gestures like the Gourmand Skeksis from "Dark Crystal" in the feast scene. I'm not kidding. It's that good. It's fennel, but you won't taste fennel once it's cooked. It's more like ZOMG WHAT DID YOU PUT IN THIS. It tastes a bit of a spicier, richer oregano, maybe a hint of cumin. If you love good food, and you love Italian, please treat yourself and try this stuff.<br /><br />1/2 oz is a tin the size of the ones you see at organic shops at the registers with the hard European fruit-flavored hard candies in them, like 2.5" or 3" across. They're not even half filled, probably due to settling, but you really don't use a lot at any one time, so it'll last a long time.<br /><br />The manufacturer I ordered from thoughtfully included recipes and free samples of other spice blends using fennel pollen; I gave one of the little samples to a friend, who was sniffing it all day with the biggest smile on her face. This is a definite good thing to have.

It was really a godsend to find this for sale on Amazon, no other store had it and the substitutions didn't sound that good. The ice cream was wonderful w/ a complex, rich flavor provided by the fennel pollen. The .5 oz comes in a container that was a little hard to open. Definitely recommend though.

I used the dill pollen on the suggested fish recipe and it was great!  Haven't tried the other sample on anything yet.<br /><br />Wish I could find it locally to save the $6 shipping, but would order again when needed.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: I love Hills!
review/text: My cat is picky, especially when it comes to dry food.  She will happily go days refusing to eat anything if I push a kibble she doesn't like on her (damn torties!.  I switched my cat from friskies to Hills Scienc Diet when she grew to adulthood.  Then I decided to try one of those natural diets, with no fillers, and only uses real meats and blah blah blah.  One she wouldn't go near, and the other she would eat reluctantly.  Except the super active, petite 7lb 4oz tortie grew to just over ten pounds, waddled when she walked, because she was horribly obese, and slept 24 hours a day, waking up only to eat, and her coat was staritng ot lose it's shine.  That scared the hell out of me!  So I switched back to Hills.  With a week, she was starting to show interest in toys again, and was already starting to lose that swaying flabby fat belly.  Now she's back down to 7lb 7oz, and very active, healthy, and happy.  I will NEVER switch her food again!

review/summary: Expensive, but it worked!
review/text: I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with "meal" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all.

review/summary: Great for pukey cat
review/text: My cat was born in August 2001, so he's almost 10 years old. Three years ago he started to throw up quite frequently. The vet ran tons of VERY EXPENSIVE tests and for the most part ruled out anything that can be treated. We tried changing food but nothing worked. I tried giving him home cooked food as well and that made throwing up even worse. So one day I was in a pet store and the clerk said he had the same problem with his cat and suggested the MOST EXPENSIVE FOOD IN STORE. I was skeptical but I had nothing to lose (but money). Three years later my cat is doing fantastic. He only throw up when I feel bad for him and give him tuna as a pity treat. He's healthy, bouncy and seems to enjoy food. The big bag lasts us for ever. We bought a bag on November 5th and today again on March 19. That's 4+ months for $40 (which is how much the bag costs in pet store). I think I can afford $10/month for my buddy. I have no idea what's in there and I don't really care. All I care is that my cat looks happy and healthy. Food purists who believe in feeding cat organic chicken and brown rice might not care for it.

review/summary: stops fecal balls
review/text: My eight month old kitty, Jitterbug came to us eating Science Diet and everything was fine.  I slowly switched him over to Purina indoor, which I've always fed my cats and had no problems with.  Well I started noticing Jitterbug was leaving small little balls of poo all over the house!  Instead of taking him to the vet and paying a lot of money on tests I thought I'd try this expensive food first and what do you know, no more poop balls!  It's too bad it's so pricey, but if I don't have to deal with feces outside the litter box, I'll pay top dollar.  My cat has been on this formula for a month now and I'm very pleased with the results.

We got him on the mend with a visit to the vet and some antibiotics.  But it wasn't until we started feeding him Science Diet that we noticed the change in his fur.  It made such a vast difference!  He has the softest fur I have ever felt on a cat!  The Science Diet seems to help with the hairballs, too.  It is a bit expensive, but it's worth every penny to me.

I started mixing this stuff in with their regular food, and now (2 years later) my oldest is 4 with healthy teeth and gums.  I saw improvement in just a month or so.  Now looking at several annual visits in a row with good dental health and no tooth brushing.  Kitties seem to like it.  Healthy weight cats with dry food to graze on all they want.  I order from petfooddirect though.  When you consider the shipping costs, it's usually a little cheaper there unless amazon has it for free shipping.

review/summary: Great product, but trust your vet not the hype
review/text: I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Sickening filler ingredients, high price
review/text: I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to "see the light" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do.

review/summary: Science Diet = terrible for cats, it's addictive
review/text: My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry.  Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because "it's good for the cats and they love it". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to "fatten her up" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: Just started using this so will update more later, I have an older cat 15 years old, everything she ate she would throw up she pretty much grew up on Iam's Weight Control cat food due to a previous urinary tract infection,and a weight problem (vet recommended) she weighed in at 17 lbs her heaviest the Iams never helped for years for weight control.Later in life she started losing the weight got down to a perfect weight then really started to lose to much then the last bag of Iams I bought her she refused to eat but a couple of kibbles a day, she was starving herself to death because even then she was throwing up,(she went down to 7lbs) I bought the Science Diet Sensitive stomach she is finally eating again, not throwing up so the food is A-OK with me and will spend the price for it, but like I said just starting using it will update on how she does more in to eating the food. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is the price and since I ordered this food online maybe finding the product in the stores around here I live very rural so getting to a store is a chore in itself at times.

review/summary: Nothing else works
review/text: I understand all the complaints about Science Diet. Believe me I avoided this food for quite awhile based on that information. I'm not thrilled about the filler, would prefer a food with no by-products, and yes in general think it is over priced. But my cat was throwing up everything else. And I do mean EVERYTHING else. I have tried so many top of the line foods for him and every single one he threw up. I took him to the vet, had all the xrays done, all the blood work done, put him on antibotics just in case... nothing. He is a perfectly healthy cat except that he was throwing up food 2 to 3 times a week. I talked to my mom who had 2 Siamese cats that lived into thier late teens and she said she fed them Science Diet. In fact, one of them had urninary tract problems and the SD was the only food that stopped his problems. So yes, I understand everything everyone is saying about why SD is so horrible... yet I can't argue with the results. I fed my cat this and it's been 3 weeks with no vomiting. My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results. And even if there were risks it's worth it not to have my poor kitty completely emptying his stomach 2-3 times a week from food that is making him sick. If your cat keeps throwing up, you've had the vet check him and there is nothing wrong and no other food is working... try this food. It really did work for my cat.

review/summary: My cat loves this cat food
review/text: My cat loves this cat food so much that we feed it to her as treats. She has a tendency to get underweight so we feed it to her pretty much on demand (which is frequently). I'd recomend it for fussy cats with tooth tartar problems (the chucks are larger than normal cat food and presumably help to clean their teeth when they crunch it). I usually buy the larger size for economy's sake, but this would be a better size to try out on your cat.

review/summary: Great product, but trust your vet not the hype
review/text: I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.

Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.

review/text: Cats are carnivores.<br /><br />Science Diet has no meat.<br /><br />Instead, you get cheap corn filler, spent rice leftover from brewing beer, and meatless chicken parts that humans don't eat, like beaks.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Obese/overweight cat? Do your research!
review/text: This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.

review/summary: The only food I give my cats!
review/text: My cats have been on Hill's Science Diet since they came home as kittens. This food is great and keeps them very healthy, it's what the vet has always recommended and I've stuck with for my cats. I get the big bag because it's easier to store it in a large air-tight container near their food and not have to worry about buying food every other week or so. So glad to see this on Amazon Prime now, I used to have to go out of my way to speciality pet stores just to get it as places like PetCo out here don't always carry it.

review/summary: Best Catfood
review/text: My cat is picky.  He also gets an upset stomach over other varieties of cat food.  However, Science diet adult optimal works best.  It was used at the shelter we bought him and he loves it and this big bag, as long as it is put in a Gallon sized tupperware type container is about half price of any pet food store.

review/summary: Works Great With My Cat
review/text: I've had several cats, most of which didn't have much of a hairball problem.  However, the cat I have now, has hocked up some epic hairballs. She's the best cat I've ever had, except for this one nasty problem.<br /><br />So, I bought a small bag of this hairball control from my vet, tried it, and it does seem to have had an effect on my cat's massive hairball problem.  In fact, after about a month of mixing this with her other food, I've noticed that she's only thrown up once or twice, and that's certainly not as much as she did before.<br /><br />I found this bag on Amazon for quite a bit less than what my vet charged, so I'll continue to order it here. Based on what I've observed with my cat so far, I would highly recommend this for those of you who have cats with the same problem.

review/summary: Great cat food, great value
review/text: I adopted my cat from a shelter and this is the type of food they fed him and urged me to continue feeding him. He absolutely loves it and I won't be changing brands or food anytime soon. It seems to be a very high quality dry cat food and it's definitely one that my cat loves. The big bag of food is great especially if you have large Rubbermaid (etc) containers to store it in so it doesn't get stale. I'm very happy with this food and I'm very glad the shelter (and my vet) ended up recommending it. My cat is happy and I'm happy knowing he is being fed appropriately with high quality food that is helping him stay healthy.

review/summary: cat food
review/text: its cat food that was offered at a good price...and being a premier member, i got free speedy shipping.  cat food starts out hard when it enters the cat.  it exits the kitty as a soft item a day later, minus nutrients/vitamins (hopefully).
