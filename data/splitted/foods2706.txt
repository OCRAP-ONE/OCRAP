review/summary: Saugar free Red Bull Energy drink
review/text: I really like/enjoy the sugar free Red Bull. I like the taste and don't need or want the added sugar. I appreciate having it available at a comparable or lower price than that in the stores, and like getting the 24 pack delivered so that I have one handy when I want one at home or to grab one when I'm going out the door. A good product at a good price that I don't have to go after to get. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Has A Kick - Recommended
review/text: Red Bull does indeed get me going when I need it! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I can't have the regular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PFUN04">Red Bull Energy Drink, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> so I get the sugar free type. The taste is not the easiest thing to get used to since it is sort of sour, but it isn't really unpleasant either. These are good in the late morning or very early afternoon for that extra kick when the morning coffee has worn off.<br /><br />I prefer the taste of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OQ74OK">Celsius - Celsius Cola, 4 cans</a>, but they are not usually sold at the stores in my area.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Love not going to the store.
review/text: This product comes in a flat box instead of the 12-pack like the smaller 8.5 oz cans do.  This was fine for us since we have the cupboard space, but not everyone does.<br /><br />I seriously love not having to go to the grocery store to stock up on energy drinks.  We go though them so fast (1 a day for myself and at least one a day for my husband) that it makes the clerks look at you a little oddly.  No, we don't live on them, but they do replace coffee in our house.<br /><br />Check around.  Friday sales are great, but regular prices are hit and miss for the best deal.

review/summary: Gerber cereals have soy in them!
review/text: Gerber cereals have soybean oil in them!!  Parents who have a baby who is sensitive/allergic to soy and don't know it may well wind up thinking that their babies are reacting to the cereals, when it's the unnecessary added ingredient.  Every parent should carefully check labels for everything, regardless of how well trusted the brand is!  (I'm amazed by all the crap Gerber puts into their foods, their toddler meals have insane amounts of sodium in them, but that's not related to the cereal.)<br /><br />Also, the boxes leak out the bottom every time you pour.  Messy.  Another major brand had cartons (like OJ cartons) but seems to be discontinuing that packaging, which is sad... they worked so much better!

review/text: I'm NOT a cheese lover by nature.  I tried this at a neighbors and couldn't believe I liked it so much.  I went to Costco the next day and bought a 1.75lb block for $10.11.  It is now a stocked product in my fridge.  I like it as a treat with sliced apples, neighbor likes it with wine.  It's like an awesome English white cheddar with a slight sharpness yet has a sweet taste rounding it to be a "real" cheese (non American cheese) that I think most people will enjoy.  It's great melted on a sandwich and takes on a deeper color and well, mmmn!  Like most cheese it's best served for full flavor at room temperature.  I eat it straight from the fridge too.

review/summary: This oatmeal is just amazing!!!
review/text: Just for starters, I have never liked oatmeal!<br /><br />I was forced to eat it as a child because it would stick to my ribs and keep me well nourished. However, it was pure torture to eat it.<br /><br />I was staying with my family at a Residence Inn last week and thought that I would give oatmeal a try from their continental breakfast bar.<br /><br />While the oatmeal did not have an objectionable taste (being nice), it was all sticky and gooey which was not too nice!<br /><br />Wanting the health benefits of oatmeal, I decided to give this product a try after reading the reviews.<br /><br />First of all, this is a more coarse cut of oatmeal, which I would not classify as "meal" at all. It is more like a boiled grain with a bit of  chewy consistency. There is nothing sticky or gooey about this at all.<br /><br />For me, the fact that I am eating oatmeal (should be called oat"grain"), is nothing short of a minor miracle. It is pleasant and tasty. What a pleasant surprise!!!!<br /><br />I hope that you will give it a try.<br /><br />Blessings ad good health to you and your family!

review/summary: Nothing better!
review/text: I highly recommend this product!  There is nothing better than steel-cut oatmeal.  For years I hated oatmeal, until a year ago I tried this oatmeal.  After reading about how nutritious and healthy this was, I decided to give it a try.  It is delicious!  I prefer it with soymilk and often add golden raisins and a few nuts chopped up.  But it is just as good with blueberries, bananas, or chopped apples.  Whatever fruit you want to add works!<br />Give yourself a treat and just try it for a couple of mornings, and you will be hooked!  Since I leave for work really early, I often make a big batch the night before, refrigerate it and microwave a bowl of it for breakfast every morning. (It can stay refrigerated for about 5 days and still taste great!)<br />All I can say now is Enjoy!

review/summary: Great product. Delicous
review/text: This is some of the best oatmeal I've ever had. Keep in mind that it takes over 30 minutes to cook (several hours in a slow-cooker) but it also holds very well for days in the refrigerator. Therefore, we always make at least triple batches and continue to heat them up in the microwave for the next few days. It is great reheated with frozen blueberries added to it. Mmmmmm<br /><br />If you've read that oatmeal can be healthy and a good way to reduce your cholesterol they aren't talking about instant oatmeal. Instant and quick (minute) oatmeal can be cooked quickly because it isn't the whole oats which are needed to get the health benefits. These steel cut oats have Dietary Fiber 4g made up of Soluble Fiber 2g and Insoluble Fiber 2g while <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1LI4">Quaker Instant Oatmeal Variety Pack, 14.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> has Dietary Fiber 3g made up of Soluble Fiber 1g and Insoluble Fiber 0g.

review/text: Best price ever for steel cut oats and they are vacuum-sealed in a can. Oats are uniformly cut and cook up in only 25 minutes. I cook a cup at a time which lasts me most of a week. They store well in a plastic storage container in the refrigerator. I measure 4 cups of water and a tsp of salt in a 6 cup pan, add a dash of nutmeg and a handful of dried cranberries (craisins?). When the water reaches a rolling boil, I tun the heat down to low (#2 0n my range), and stir in a cup of the oats, set the timer to 25 minutes, come back when it goes off and store the cooked oats. A bowl of these oats with Sweet n Low and milk heated in the microwave will keep me satisfied for 5 -6 hours. Great fiber!!!

review/summary: Better than rolled oats
review/text: Our purchase of McCann's began with my husband wanting to eat a healthier breakfast and wondering what steel cut oats were. We've always eaten the rolled oats and wondered how steel cut oats could be so much better.  Well, they do take a little longer to cook, but no worse than cooking brown rice, and just as easy.  Since our mornings require a quick breakfast I cook a batch (four cups of water, one cup of oats)in the evening and store it in a covered container in the fridge, the next morning we scoop out a serving, heat in the microwave for a minute stir in sugar and cinnamon then add milk.  This makes four hefty servings.  Now eating it requires some time.  You don't just swallow this stuff like the regular rolled oats you may already be accustomed to.  They have a great slightly chewy quality and a great nutty taste that rolled oats just don't seem to have.  McCann's steel cut oats are to be savored.  Don't microwave it long, just enough to warm it.  I'll reserve the old rolled oats for oatmeal cookies, but McCann's is for breakfast from now on at our house. Hubby likes it with one or more of these additions: chopped dates, chopped figs, pecans, raisins, dried cranberries, chopped apples, cinnamon.  It's seems more like a dessert.

review/summary: mighty fine
review/text: I eat oats with some regularity (pun intended).  The rolled oats are fine when I'm in a hurry.  When there is time, steel cut is the way to go.  These McCann's oats are pretty good.  When I have a lot of time, I use Alton Brown's overnight oatmeal recipe as a starting point.  My recipe is basically a cup of oats, 3 cups water, a 1 cup milk, and a cup or two of dried fruity stuff if any is handy.  It goes into a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R4FTZU">crock pot</a> and cooks overnight.  I cook mine on medium.<br /><br />Next time I order oats I'm going to try out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007NG56S">Steel Cut Oats Pinhead Oatmeal - Bulk 50 Pound Bag</a>.  The price is too good.

review/text: This is the best oatmeal I have ever eaten - and I've tried many brands.  McCann's is more like a meal than a bowl of cereal.  The tins are also great for long-term storage so I keep them coming on a subscription basis.  The Quick and Easy variety is also delicious and cooks up quickly.  Cooking several servings at once is simple.  Bring 8 cups of water to a boil and then add 2 cups of oatmeal, reduce heat and cover for 5 minutes stirring often. After cooling, refrigerate and enjoy as a cold snack throughout the day or nuke and enjoy hot. Add whatever treats you enjoy most.  Splenda and blueberries are my favorite additives.  I get about 90 miles per bowl.

While I find great savings on books, this is one example where the Amazon price isn't so great, and for me the front door delivery isn't offset by the large price difference.<br /><br />So the product gets 5-stars, the price gets 1-star.

review/summary: Cooking it in a programmable Rice Cooker makes for an easier breakfast!
review/text: I never had much patience for Steel Cut Oats, until I read about someone using a rice cooker to make it.<br /><br />How easy could that be?  I have an old 3 cup "fuzzy logic" type Rice Cooker, and using "Porridge" mode works best.  A word of warning, do not rinse the oats, just pour in the water, set for porridge, press start, and walk away!  I am used to rinsing rice and did that with the oats, and it was really dry, not at all oatmeal.<br />If your rice cooker has a timer, you can set it up the night before too.<br /><br />Using a rice cooker makes cooking steel cut oats more convenient than cooking instant oatmeal on the stove.  It is pretty slow though, but if you are used to rice cooking times, you'll be fine.  Just don't expect it to be done in 5 minutes or less.<br /><br />And McCann's Steel Cut Oats in general?  I haven't had a chance to compare it to other brands, but I really like the tin cans.  Very strong and thick.  But I don't really like the thick foil seal, cutting it leaves a rather sharp and ragged edge.<br />Of the many cans of McCanns Steel Cut Oats, they have excellent quality control, same great taste each time.<br /><br />-Ed

review/summary: Great Oatmeal
review/text: I have been eating oatmeal on and off for the last ten years and recently I have found myself enjoying a nice hot bowl for breakfast, especially because its winter. I was first introduced to John McCann's Oatmeal when I decided to quit eating rolled oats because of their texture and the inspiration of watching the episode of "GOOD EATS" featuring steel cut or pinhead or Irish oats. I originally found these oats at my local market and found them to be delicious, although, they do take awhile to properly cook they are by far the best option in terms of flavor, nutrition and texture. Their flavor is similar to brown rice while still having a bit of a "wheaty" taste. They are very nutritious, but as most nutritious foods are, they must be portioned because of their high calorie content, (I find that half a cup, 300 calories, is the perfect amount) although they are very good for fighting cholesterol and the fat they contain is "good" fat. Their texture is also similar to brown rice, but softer and creamier if prepared in such a fashion. I make my oats two ways, on the weekdays I make them in a rice cooker overnight which produces a piping hot bowl of deliciousness and on the weekends I take my time and prepare them on the stove top. They really are a delicious way to start my day and I look forward to enjoying a bowl every morning. Being that I eat pinhead oats everyday I found that buying these tins was beginning to get quite expensive, so one day I went to a bulk foods market and bought a pound of bulk steel cut oats thinking they would be a lower quality and good for the weekdays. Since then I have done numerous side-by-side comparisons of the two and they are exactly the same in taste and texture, making paying double for John McCann's Oats a delicious, but obsolete choice nonetheless.<br /><br />Pros: Delicious, nutritious, and the tin is re usable.<br />Cons: Somewhat expensive when compared to bulk options.<br />Overall: Buy these if you aren't going to be eating them everyday; they are delicious and well worth the money.<br /><br />I cook my steel cut oats on the stove top thusly:<br />1/2 cup steel cut oats<br />1 tbsp unsalted butter<br />2 cup water (boiling)<br />1/2 cup milk<br />1 pinch of kosher salt<br />2 tsp sweetener (brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup)<br /><br />Take a 12" sauce pan (or something comparable) with a lid and turn heat to medium, add butter, let melt and add oats. The idea here is to roast the oats. Be sure to shake the pan around every minute or so to keep the oats from burning. After about three to four minutes or until the oats smell toasty add the boiling water and drop the heat to low and cover. Let sit for thirty minutes and slowly stir the oats every five minutes until done. After thirty minutes has elapsed add milk, salt and sweetener stir until combined (If a more creamy mixture is desired add more milk or cream to oats). Serve hot and enjoy.

review/summary: The best oatmeal out there!
review/text: I like this stuff better than regular oatmeal because it is healthier, tastes better, and creamier. Now the directions say to make it with four cups water and one cup of the dry oatmeal. But I make it with two cups of water, two cups of milk, and one cup of oatmeal. That adds to the creaminess.<br /><br />Also, here is a wonderful tip I learned from my many times of cooking the oatmeal. This stuff takes about thirty minutes to cook normally (because it has to simmer for a while). What I do is cook it the night before. I boil the milk/water, add the oatmeal, stir it in, put the cover on, then put it in my fridge (without cooking for 30 minutes). In the morning you then take that pot and basically just slowly warm it up to a boil and presto! lovely, creamy steel cut oatmeal for breakfast. BTW, that is enough oatmeal for two people.

I cook my oatmeal according to the direction, listed on the can,<br /><br />4 cups of water, bring to a boil and 1 cup of oatmeal. When I added the oatmeal to the boiling water, I stir, let it get a little thick, than I place a lid on the pot of oatmeal to steam it a little. It has to cook for 30 min. Its has a wonderful chewy texture, it does not taste anything like the oatmeal in the supermarkets, soo good. I eat this oatmeal ever morning for my breakfast.

review/text: Bought this oatmeal because of Dr.Oz on Oprah. Very glad I did. It's delicious. Much better then conventional oatmeal. Different tasting but very good and hearty. I cook it the night before ( because it takes awhile to cook - and one cup makes alot!)while it's hot-  add some cinnamon, a little brown sugar and put it in the frig. In the morning, I add milk to the cold oatmeal and microwave for 11/2 or 2 min.. Try it, you may like it! Will replace my stock when it's gone.

review/summary: Excellent slow cook oatmeal
review/text: I was never a fan of oatmeal when I was a kid.  To me oatmeal meant bland and mushy instant oatmeal.  Then an episode of "Good Eats" convinced me to give this grain another try.  Now I eat a big bowl of McCann's oatmeal about every other morning.  I don't like milk so I cook it in fruit juice, sometimes with dried fruit added.  When I cook it in orange juice, I add dried cranberries.  When I cook it in apple juice, I sprinkle cinnamon and just a little nutmeg on it.  I generally cook it in a crock pot set on low for several hours.<br /><br />Regarding the packaging:  Sure the cans get dinged up during shipment.  So what?  The oats don't suffer.  Even with the dents, the cans are still sealed airtight and the oats are delicious.

It tastes wonderful--I'll never go back to traditional or instant oatmeal--I'm now spoiled.  Plus having breakfast ready the next morning can't be beat--you can only do this with steel cut oats, by the way.  You'd only get mush with any other type.

review/text: Heres the trick to cooking McCann's Oatmeal, the night before boil your water then add oatmeal turn off the heat then cover. Next morning before you do anything, Stir, looking for a fairly stable consistancy and turn on a very low heat. Then return to getting ready for the day, returning to stir occasionally. It will be ready in 15-20 minutes. Great with Splenda/Brown surgar blend, banannas, strawberries, or whatever. Then a couple slices of Ezekeal toast with butter and flax seed oil. Be healthy.

review/summary: Heavenly oatmeal.
review/text: Oatmeal is a comfort food for me.  I hate the instant stuff as I was home-grown on my grandmother's long-cooking rolled oats that she cooked on a kerosene-burning stove.<br /><br />When in Ireland many years ago, I had steel-cut oats on several occasions -- another amazing experience. Any time I've tried Irish Oats at restaurants here in the U.S., they've had a funny taste.  I suspect most kitchens use shortcuts.<br /><br />I was thrilled when I purchased these oats, cooked them with care, and tasted the results. Heavenly! No shortcuts to great oatmeal.

review/summary: I really wanted to like this.
review/text: After reading all of the reviews, I ordered this.  I am trying to lower my cholesterol and I am not fond of rolled oats.  I was a bit disappointed in this product.  I guess that I expected a better textured oatmeal, but I was not pleased with the "brown rice" cooked product.  Yes, it was like eating brown rice for breakfast - not that I have anything against brown rice.  This oatmeal does have a little more flavor than regular rolled oats oatmeal.  I also don't have time to cook oatmeal every morning for at least 30 minutes, so I guess you could say that I don't have time for these oats.  If you have the time and like oatmeal to begin with, you may like these.  If you don't like oatmeal and don't have a bunch of time to spend cooking these, then I wouldn't suggest buying them.  Personally, I am going back to eating old fashioned rolled oats - 3 minutes in the microwave and they are done.

review/text: McCann's steel cut oatmeal is good stuff. I was always tired of many hot breakfasts because it felt like you were eating something that though it may have tasted good it lacked appeal because it had no chew or texture to it. Try this steel-cut oatmeal and see if it is not a whole lot more interesting. Dress it up with a little milk, cream, maple syrup. brown sugar, molasses and see if you don't buy more. Buy a pack of 4 tins and save on shipping too!

review/summary: Awesome.  Plain and Simple.
review/text: Have tried several of the popular Steel Cut Oats products from various manufacturers over the past couple years.<br /><br />This is hands down the best we have tasted (and less expensive here on Amazon than any of the other brands we've tried so far, even some in bulk packaging).  Our 8 and 9 year olds LOVE it, and ask for it every day for breakfast.  They moan when we serve something else, like any cereal from a box......even those 99% sugary cereals (actually have some going stale...they won't eat it anymore!).<br /><br />We cook this in a rice cooker on the porridge setting. Takes an hour...but if you plan ahead, or use the timer setting, it's so worth the wait.  Creamy, but still a bit al dente.  Put any fresh or dried fruit in it...along with some honey or pure maple syrup....just AWESOME.<br /><br />Even the cans are pretty and nice....kids want to save them for storing stuff.

review/summary: Ohh, ohh, oatmeal.
review/text: In an effort to eat more healthily, I bought McCANN's Steel Cut Oatmeal.  I'm sure most of you know, that steel cut oatmeal aren't rolled and boiled, so as a result, become slightly more nutritious than its rolled oat cousins.  Rolled oats are common in the instant oatmeals.  But enough of history.<br />Now, I didn't really know how much oatmeal this would yield, but one cup yields enough for 4 large servings.  As a 4-pack, I think this will probably last me a few months, easily.  Maybe the only pain is that it takes half an hour to make, but it's worth it.  The oats provide a nice bite and a slight crunch, but it's overall smooth.  Honey is always a good thing to add for quick flavor.  Fruits work just as well.  If you're feeling really adventurous, and have a brulee torch on hand, you can sprinkle the top with some sugar and proceed to brulee! And of course, you can add fruit before or after the brulee for a new dimension of flavor!<br />Bottom line, this will fill you up, and for quite a long time.

review/text: I love this stuff.  I first had it at a four star hotel while on vacation.  I think this brand is far better than the Quaker Oats Steel Cut version and Bob's.<br /><br />A great way to make it, adapted from Cook's Illustrated:<br /><br />1.  Melt one tablespoon of butter in a pan and add one DRY cup of oatmeal.<br />2.  Then add it to two  cups of water and one cup of milk that have been simmering.<br />3.  Towards the end of cooking, around 30 minutes in, add 1/4 teaspoon of salt.<br />4.  Cook for about 45 minutes.  Add additional water or milk if needed and serve.<br />5.  I usually double the recipe when i'm cooking for the family.

review/summary: For the oatmeal conoisseur
review/text: If you are used to microwaving your Quaker oatmeal and pouring a packet of powder that is mildly like apples and cinnamon into the bowl, then this might not be the oatmeal for you. It has things like texture and a flavor of its own going for it. This is a man's breakfast, not a child's. It's thick, it's hearty and it tastes fine without a bunch of sugar, syrup or fruit, although I must admit, I am partial to adding fruit. Bananas are nice. This tin is an excellent value. If you go to Whole Foods or a similar shopping establishment to buy your Mc Cann's, you are not getting the most out of your breakfast dollar. Buy your Mc Cann's in bulk! You're going to want plenty of it around!

review/text: This is my favorite breakfast.  The oatmeal that is readily available in the store has been cooked, pressed and dried three times.  This is a true whole grain.  It takes a while to cook, which is why I make enough for the week on Sunday.  This breakfast is hearty, chewy and, unlike your morning corn flakes, it has substance when you eat it.  My favorite way to eat is is with milk, brown sugar and strawberries.  If you are a texture person and do not like rice, you will probably not like this cereal.

review/text: As someone who is 60+, I remembered enjoying steel-cut oats as a child and thought that it was a product that was long-gone from the food scene...in fact, I remember it was difficult for my mother to find it even back then.  I was surprised to see it offered at Amazon and decided to try it.  It has the same dense, crunchy texture I remembered and a great flavor. In addition to eating it with some sort of sweetning (brown sugar, maple syrup, etc.) and milk, we also make it as a 'hash' where we mix prepared steel-cut oats with pork sausage and then saute patties.  I also enjoy it simply with butter,salt, and pepper.  As you can tell, I love it and recommend it!

review/text: Both my husband and I love the taste of this oatmeal.  A nutty flavor with wonderful texture.  I never realized how bland some oatmeal was until I tried this brand.  This is a long cooking oatmeal but worth the wait.  I think that precooked oatmeal has too many nutritients removed in the process. If you want fiber in your diet, this is one of the best sources available and low calorie if don't add in butter or cream.  I always make a big pot of it so it lasts the week.  I add jam or preserves for sweetness and sometimes maple syrup or honey.  Fresh fruit when in season really is great or spices for a change. Since we use it daily, the 28 ounce tins are the most economical especially if on sale.

review/text: McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal makes a really great breakfast.  It's taste, texture are far superior to any brand I've ever had. It's hardy, nutritious, versatile every day.  For Sunday breakfast hard to beat, I recommend starting off with a steaming bowl with your choice of flavorings (if desired, it's good by itself)--you can add some brown sugar, maple flavoring, blueberries, chopped apple, apricots, cranberries, banana or whatever (it's good with everything).  Serve it with orange, apple, grape, cranberry or some juice and coffee or tea.  Follow with English muffins, bagels or toast, favorite type of eggs, sausage or bacon and fresh fruit, and I'll guarantee, you'll swear you'll have a gourmet meal. I order it by the case regularly.

review/summary: Fantastic oatmeal!
review/text: I hate the glue-like consistency of rolled oats, and even the pulverized flavored oats with tons of sugar are pretty nasty to me. I love the texture of steel cut oats, and McCann's is one of the better brands (not all steel cut oats are the same). They taste great and are easy to prepare, either by using a rice cooker, slow cooker/crockpot, or preparing the night before by boiling half the required liquid, adding the oats, then cover and remove from the stove and let it sit overnight. Add a little more liquid if needed the next day, nuke in the microwave and its good to go! Try adding peanut butter and cocoa powder with one packet of Splenda per serving, dried fruit, cinnamon and brown sugar, or even a spoon of canned pie filling such as apple or cherry.<br /><br />Others have mentioned problems with the packaging and receiving dented cans, but I think Amazon has fixed that problem. My 4 cans came shrink-wrapped together, along with a sturdy cardboard bottom. That was inside a larger box with a bunch of air pillows for padding, so the cans are completely unblemished.

I cook mine in my Zojirushi Induction Rice Cooker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MAIW1C">Zojirushi NP-HBC18 10-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer with Induction Heating System, Stainless Steel</a>. I use 4 parts water to I part Oat plus a drop of Extra virgin Olive Oil to avoid sticky residue on the cover. Alternatively I use 2 parts "Original Rice Dream" plus 2 parts water to 1 part Oat. Substitute the word "part" with the word "Cup". I put the mixture in the Rice Cooker and select the Porridge cycle and in 1 hr 7 Mins the cooker would play a beautiful melody to signify that breakfast is ready. You can use the timer setting on the cooker too but it may have a little 'leftover' or 'overcooked' grain taste to it in the morning. This is why I do not like the taste of the so-called "GABA Brown Rice". But if you have to leave for work early morning then timer cooking may be a way to go. If you like your oats thick then use 3 parts water to 1 part Oat. Once the Oat is done what you put into it depends on how health conscious you are as well as the limit of your imagination.  Toss in a few dried dates or cherries, how about a spoonful of wheat germ or flax seed? Be creative and your body would thank you for it. I do not cook my oats on stove or in the micro wave. Always buy fresh Oats.

review/summary: Better than Oatmeal!
review/text: Oatmeal has always been a favorite of mine and one day heard that Martha Stewart recommended trying the Cut Irish Oatmeal. I did and was amazed to notice a difference in the texture, the flavor was very distinct, and after a bowl of the McCann's Irish oatmeal you are very satisfied. Great with fresh fruit on it and even holds up to adding brown sugar. These cans make great gifts to those that appreciate the "best".<br />This is my second time purchasing this product from Amazon and will continue. We live in a very small town and this food item is not available locally.

review/text: This is some of the most delicious oatmeal I have ever tasted. It is an all-natural product and the oatmeal is REAL. Unlike the weird flavor you get from "Quick Oats", this product tastes delicious with no aftertaste.<br /><br />In a week, I was more regular (lots of good fiber), and the oatmeal is very filling and delicious with honey and milk. You can cook it in a slow cooker with plenty of water and get a creamy soup-consistency (I like my oatmeal less thick and more like a porridge). If you make a big batch, you can add a little water and heat it up in the microwave. Although it's fantastic when it's fresh right off the stove.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

We'll prepare this oatmeal for breakfast during the week as well but leave out the Drambuie.<br /><br />The texture and nutty flavor of this oatmeal sets it apart from anything else we've experienced. Until a friend recommended McCann's to our family, we'd only stocked various brands of instant oatmeal. Breakfast had been perfunctory with oatmeal as just another option among cereal bars and yogurt.<br /><br />We highly recommend McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal.

review/text: We've eaten all  brands of oatmeal for years, McCanns Steel Cut Oatmeal is the best product I have found.  Cooked according to directions, it has a chewy texture, nutty flavor, and is satisfying.  I prefer it without extra sweetener.  My microwave simmer cycle brings liquid to a boil and then reduces power to simmer for time set.  Using the microwave, I don't worry about scorching or burning. Use a large bowl to allow for oatmeal and water to come to a boil but not spill over.  If it boils over, it is a mess.  I prepare it first thing in the morning and ready to eat in 20-30 minutes. Amazon price has been competitive.

About a month later, I saw the Mccann's for $4.99 and gave them a try.  Unlike the non-irish oats i tried, you can taste these.  These are simply amazing.  Buying a cheaper, non-irish variety is a waste of money.  Nothing beats these.  Amazing and the best tasting oats available.

review/text: I'm going to sound like a broken record, but this oatmeal is great.  I have always shivered at the thought of cooked oatmeal because I just find cooked Quaker oats to be nauseating (love them in cookies, but not cooked by themselves).  My parents eat oatmeal all of the time, but I just couldn't stomach the thought of it.  However, this stuff was part of a promotion, and people wrote that it doesn't taste like Quaker, so I gave it a shot.  I'm so glad that I did, because they are right!  This stuff is fantastic.  To me, it's texture and taste are soooo much better than what I've had in the past.  Like the reviewer before me, I added some agave nectar and really liked the combination.<br /><br />All four of my tins arrived crushed, and I mean crushed.  However, Amazon very promptly filled another order of them for me as a replacement.  Another example of excellent service by Amazon!

review/text: McCann's steel cut oatmeal is the real deal.  Unlike most products which have a plastic or paper container, McCann's still comes in an easy to open tin which a person can use for many things after the oats are long gone.  The oatmeal is not for a person in a hurry as you need almost 30 minutes to prepare.  But the cooked oatmeal is well worth waiting for.  Unlike rolled oatmeal which to me makes a mushy product which I won't eat, steel cut oats actually retain some of their shape after being cooked.  Since I've started eating oatmeal regularly, my total cholesterol has dropped 20 points!  McCann's steel cut oatmeal have a long shelf life, so I'm not afraid of buying a 4-pack or even two 4-packs when they are on special.  I've seen one can go for over $6 in some special food markets.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Taste, Flavor,Time, and Value
review/text: Recently I've substituted steel cut oats for our cereal of choice after years of eating  rolled oats (both regular and quick cook). I've tried McCanns and Country Choice, and since there are many reviews already posted,  I'll slant mine based on Taste (mouth), Flavor (nose), Preparation, and Value.<br /><br />I rate Taste (nutty and chewy) and Flavor (pleasant aroma) a dead heat (5*). I also looked at the Nutrition Labels of McCanns, Country Choice, and Quaker's rolled oats, both regular and instant. List included calories, total fats, carbs, fiber, and protein and all were virtually identical from a nutritional standpoint<br /><br />Preparation. I've cooked all types of oatmeal via stove top but have not used the microwave. However, for the steel cut oats I also used a rice cooker, a Zojirushi model that had the capability for making porridge (this is the setting you want to use for steel cut oats),  and this  model had a timer that could be set in advance to finish cooking at a predetermined time. Although use of the rice cooker still requires a passage of time, actual cooking is automatic,  whereas using the stovetop required at least 25-30 minutes of simmering and close supervision to prevent scorching. (Of course, rolled oats takes less time.)<br /><br />Value: McCann's oats comes in a very attractive and elegant metal container (28 oz) and stresses the fact that it's Irish in origin whereas Country Choice comes in a cardboard container(30 oz) similar to the rolled oats type and boasts the fact that it is home grown (Minnesota) and is certified "organic." It should be noted that McCann also packages its steel cut oats in a cardboard box (16 oz). If you make your purchase via Amazon (current prices) and disregard the shipping expense, the per ounce cost is: McCann's 28 oz container cost 20.6 cents, McCann's 16 oz container cost 19.13 cents, and Country Choice cost 11.27 cents.<br /><br />Since my personal evaluation finds both products even in Taste and Flavor, and both have similar cooking methodologies, my FIVE STAR choice is for the home grown, organic certified Country Choice which also a big budget saver.

review/summary: Fantastic product and price
review/text: This makes the best oatmeal, full of flavor and nutrients. Steel cut oatmeal is not for everyone, including those in my family who are fans of Cream of Wheat. But for those who like to have something with texture, McCann's is excellent: nutty, slightly chewy, and filling enough for a real breakfast that will carry one through to lunch.<br /><br />The cooking time is longer than more processed oats, but those are, well, processed, lacking the nutrition, texture, and flavor of steel cut oats. Others have posted their favorite cooking methods, so one can see that there are several ways to make this faster. I make up a whole batch, which makes four cups, eat one serving fresh and store the rest in the frig. All it takes is 90 seconds in the microwave with a little soy milk, or whatever you prefer, and it's hot and creamy for the fastest breakfast. Great with no sweetener or with one's favorite (brown sugar, real maple syrup, artificial sweetener, honey), with fruit and nuts, with cream, milk, soymilk (in my case), or nothing. It'll stand up to just about anything or, for purists, on its own.<br /><br />I have an Amazon subscription for McCann's steel cut oats, so I've gotten many, many cans of it over the years. A few of them (out of dozens of cans) might have been slightly dented, as a couple of reviewers noted, but only very slightly dented, not more than one might find in the grocery store. The can is solid and has a sealed inner lining, which has always been intact. I've never had one taste stale, as one reviewer mentioned, and I've stocked up on the stuff and had it around for many months. Others have written about the nutritional reasons to go for steel cut oats, and Amazon's prices are great, several dollars cheaper than I can get it in my small town. Plus, it is gluten free, for those with this dietary concern.

I have not encountered any stale smell at all, as one review mentioned.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that most of my cans are dented.<br /><br />I would have rated the product higher, but until I start getting cans which have not been compromised (which I've requested), I can't rate this any higher than a generous 3 stars out of 5.

review/summary: Apparently Gluten-Free
review/text: I read in the book "The Gluten Connection" that these oats are tested and are gluten free, and also no chance of cross-contamination, because they are from Europe who is WAY WAY WAY!!!!! ahead of the game as far as GF foods and testing for specific levels of gluten are concerned. This one came up safe.<br />I checked with my doctor/specialist and she had heard the same thing.<br />I also heard on Oprah that this is all she'll eat, so I tried them. Once you get used to it, you'll never go back to that bowl of slime.<br /><br />PS: Whole grains are SUPPOSED to take longer to cook because they aren't broken down. So try it!

review/summary: Product great! Packaging lousy!
review/text: Ordered 8 cans (to qualify for free shipping). Virtually every one was dented from being banged around. Cereal was fine but the packaging was terrible.<br /><br />The oatmeal itself is great. Pour a 1/2 cup in boiling water and turn heat down to lowest simmer, stir occasionally for 15-20 mins. Knocks the socks off Quacker Oats for taste (as far as oatmeal has "taste").

review/summary: Selling dented cans.
review/text: Although packaging was perfectly intact, three of the four cans received were badly dented. This gives me the impression that the seller is intentionally selling dented cans of the product. I would buy this product again but only from a store where undamaged merchandise can be visually inspected before purchase. Selling damaged merchandise is not good customer service.

review/summary: I cannot say enough good things about this stuff
review/text: I first heard about steel cut oats on the Oprah show about its health benefits.  First of all I DO NOT like regular oatmeal like you buy in the grocery store.  I don't like the slimy texture.  But I figured I'd try steel cut oats and I'm glad I did.  They are delicous and very good for you!  The warm nutty aroma when they are cooking is very appetizing.  I add a little bit of sugar or splenda and some cinnimon, it tastes fantastic!  I also sometimes skip the cinnimon and add a tablespoon of granola and/or some dried berries.  Excellent healthy breakfast.<br /><br />Normally these take about 30 minutes to cook on the stovetop.  I found a way to cut the cooking time in half.  Take 1/3 cup of oats, and 1 1/3 cup of water and put it in a large microwavable bowl.  Cook in the microwave on High for 5 minutes, stir, then another 5 minutes, then stir again, and then cook about another 2-3 minutes until the texture is just the way you like it.<br /><br />For those of you who are asking what the difference is between regular oatmeal and steel cut oatmeal:<br /><br />-Steel-Cut Oats are whole grain groats (the inner portion of the oat kernel) which have been cut into two or three pieces using steel discs. Golden in color and resembling mini rice particles, they are as nature intended - nothing added and nothing taken out.<br /><br />-Rolled oats are flake oats that have been steamed, rolled, re-steamed and toasted. Due to all of this additional processing they have lost some of their natural taste, goodness and texture.

review/summary: The best oatmeal available in the U.S.A.
review/text: If you dislike oatmeal made from rolled oats, try this product. You will like it. If you like oatmeal made from rolled oats, try this product. You will LOVE it. You must cook this oatmeal for half an hour, so put it on before your shower. You can eat it plain if you make it thin, or you can add cream, half-and-half, whole milk, or 2% milk to thin it a bit. I also like it with a dollop of plain yogurt. Sweeten it with brown sugar or raw sugar, or just add dried fruit (dates and figs are my favorites - dried cherries are good also). Goes well also with a sprinkle of walnut pieces. But here is the best way to eat it -- better than dessert:<br /><br />Sweeten cooked oatmeal slightly with a modest amount of brown sugar, add just enough half-and-half to wet it thoroughly, and then add a healthy serving of fresh blueberries. Now THAT is some breakfast.

review/summary: "Al Dente" Oatmeal
review/text: Steel cut oatmeal has a grainy, hearty texture that's more like al dente pasta than mush.  American grown varieties often have a gelatinous texture between the grains.  The Irish grown oatmeal is firm and nutty through and through.<br /><br />My electric range cooks the oatmeal in about 25 minutes.  I use a straight-edged spatula to keep the oatmeal from sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Avoid over-stirring to keep that nice, firm texture.<br /><br />More good news: Steel-cut oatmeal, like chili or stew, is better on the second day.  Pour your leftovers into a bowl, lay plastic film directly on the surface of the oatmeal, and store in the 'fridge.  Reheat in the microwave with a spoonful of water for a minute or two.<br /><br />Genuine maple syrup is the best sweetener for oatmeal, in my opinion.  Add diced apples or raisins or bananas, with a little milk, and you've got yourself a bowlful of breakfast!

review/summary: STALE BUT GOOD WITH HONEY
review/text: I can tell this is a great oatmeal. It's thick, chewy, wholesome, filling but does not feel like a lead weight in your stomach. However, there is a slight stale smell when opening each can and if you eat them without brown sugar or honey you can taste that staleness. I would not buy them from amazon again as it seems they were kept around too long. You can get them for $5 a can at Trader Joe's I noticed today. I think the turnover there would be faster so will be doing that from now on. Great product though!

review/summary: This is the Best
review/text: McCann's (in the tin)  is nothing like the tasteless mush that passes for oatmeal in the U.S.. True, it does take 25 minutes and sometimes you need to fool with the water amount and/or the flame until you figure out what to do to get it exactly as you like -- too high a flame, for example, does away with the water before the oatmeal is completely cooked, but remember you don't want it to cook so long that the special consistency is lost. I've cooked it for years but even so when I took a can to our country place where we have a propane gas stove, it was as though I'd never made it before. However, the finished product is  well worth the time. Even unadorned or  with just a bit of grated nutmeg, it has a satisfying crunch and slightly nutty taste. My husband, based on bad childhood oatmeal memories, initially turned up his nose at the thought of eating oatmeal; he likes it so much he makes it for himself several times a week. Two of our younger grandkids accustomed to starting the day with cold commercial cereal ask for the "special" oatmeal when they visit. Additionally, it's substantial; a  serving at breakfast easily holds you till lunch time. PLEASE NOTE -- what I've written refers only to McCann's in the tin; I've never tried the flakes.

review/summary: These Oats are Not For Sowing...
review/text: They're for eating, of course (ok, maybe if you're an oat farmer, you have a different persepctive.)  At any rate, rather than argue the relative virtues of rolled vs. steel cut oat cereals, I sing the praises of both.  Maybe it's a seasonal thing, the somewhat coarser, nuttier, rougher steel cuts somehow more fitting to cold winters than are the mellower and softer rolled oats.  It's like black coffee to an au lait, dark beer to light, hard bebop to cool jazz...you get the picture.<br /><br />You'll also feel virtuous spending some old-fashioned time over the stove (albeit not that much, or that arduous).  The warming experience is itself sufficient, you'll feel like mending a fence somewhere (or tearing it down if in a RObert Frost frame of mind), but it's common to top this<br /><br />with contrasting fruit, or perhaps nuts, syrups, flax seed oil, brown sugar, yoghurt, raisins, prunes, lat night's stew?--it's HEARTY enough to stand up to almost anything you can throw at it.  Your doctor will probably extol the nutritional benefits: Fiber, protein, certain vitamins, etc.  McCann's is the best of the bunch, and yes, that is a can that belongs in the Smithsonian--or its Irish equivalent. Hebridean soul food.

review/summary: A fine bowl of porridge
review/text: McCann's is "just" oatmeal, but it's perhaps the best oatmeal widely available in the United States.  It's made from nothing but 100% whole grain oat kernels which are grown in Ireland and cut in a device similar to a burmill.  The cutting technique provides a much firmer and more complex texture than the rolling which is used on commoditized oatmeal products available in the U.S.  This is not an "instant" or "quick" oat product, and these oats have not been precooked at all.<br /><br />What this means is that McCann's Traditional makes a great bowl of porridge with a fresh grain flavor and an al dente consistency.  This is oatmeal with a natural crunch and tang to it.  Rolled oats -- especially instant, sugar-added, flavored rolled oats -- don't come close.<br /><br />The obverse of this is that you are actually cooking these grains rather than merely heating and stirring a pre-cooked product.  Be prepared to spend some time -- a half hour or so -- in your kitchen  watching over these and stirring them with your spurtle (porridge-stirring spoon).  Consider this a luxury, an excuse to slow down for a while.  You can find cooking ideas and great recipes at goldenspurtle dot com, which is the home page for the world porridge-making championships.  Specialty porridges, made with fresh fruits, liqueurs, and cream sauces, make distinctive desserts if you really want to get creative.<br /><br />A few more things: these oats are kosher, the can looks sharp, and they make great cookies.

review/summary: McCann Steel Cut Oats
review/text: SHIPPING<br /><br />As was stated by many others, the shipping for this product is too hard on the cans.  Of my four cans, one was nearly undamaged.  One had cosmetic damage in the form of a dented side.  The other two were dented to the extent of having sharp creases in the bottom and flaws near the seal lines at the top.  I never buy cans like those at the supermarket.<br /><br />COOKING<br /><br />The cooking went much better than I expected.  The evening before, I put 1/4 cup chopped black walnuts, 10 pitted prunes cut into pieces with scissors, and two cups of water into my saucepan.  I brought this mixture to a boil over a simmering-level flame on my propane stove.  I dumped in one-half-cup of McCann's steel cut oats and stirred.  I waited for the mixture to come to a boil again, stirred it a little, turned off the flame, put a lid on the saucepan, and went to bed.  In the morning I was surprised to find that it was perfectly edible with no further cooking.  I did heat it up again on the stove before serving but it stuck to the pot, so I think in the future I will microwave it right in the bowls just before serving it.<br /><br />EATING<br /><br />These oats were good, but it was hard to say if they were "nuttier" in flavor than the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats which I had been eating because I cooked them both with nuts.  The texture was of course firmer.  I do like bulgar wheat and these oats are more like that in texture.  Since I was careful not to overcook the rolled oats, there was not much difference in the "slime" feel of the two, but the rolled oats were papery much like eating raw oatmeal cookie dough.<br /><br />NUTRITION<br /><br />I found little difference between the nutritional content listed on the McCann steel cut can and that listed on the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats container.  I had to do some Internet research to find the differences which turn out to be subtle but important for certain types of health conditions.  There is also the likelihood of the product simply being fresher due to less processing and better packaging at the mill.<br /><br />REPEAT PURCHASE<br /><br />Now that I have found that the cooking of steel cut oats is much less intimidating than I had imagined, I will probably eat these in preferance to rolled oats in the future.  The possibility of adding them to soups and other cooked entrees in place of barley or bulgar wheat is a bonus.  However, I will probably try a more economical source as I am not convinced that Ireland's soil is superior to that in any other region in which oats are farmed, and metal cans with sharp creases and bent seams don't seem worth the extra cost.

review/summary: THE Best !
review/text: The winter of 2006 found me searching for food items in this price range to add to my order, so I could advantage of a "Special" that Amazon was offering.<br /><br />When I came upon these, I decided that they would make nice additions to Christmas gifts as the tins are so attractive.  Upon receipt of the order, one of the tins was dented.  I decided to go ahead and open the dented tin, since it wasn't pretty enough to be a gift.<br /><br />The prepared cereal from that dented tin was so delicious that I ended up giving only 1 tin away - I kept the others for ME!  I gave that tin to my Sister.  After my Sister tried it she immediately tossed the oatmeal she had on hand, and placed a double order for this!<br /><br />This oatmeal is full of flavor, has a great chewy texture, and is so filling.  It is also much more nutritious than rolled oats.<br /><br />I can't believe how we (in the USA) have had only "rolled oats" on our breakfast tables!  Where has this oatmeal been?  What do the US companies do with the good stuff they remove to be able to roll the oats?  This real oatmeal is nothing like the gooey stuff we were forced to eat as children, and as adults eat to try to lower our cholesterol.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself (and your friends and family) to place an order.  I guarantee you'll never go back to the guy with the funny hat!

review/summary: Excellent, but over priced
review/text: I completely agree with everyone else that steel cut oatmeal is the ultimate low calorie healthy breakfast.<br /><br />But McCann's oats are overpriced.<br /><br />Steel cut oats are not unique to McCann (though their oats are grown in Ireland); many other food companies sell them. Despite the location of where the oats are grown, the taste is identical and the nutrition facts are virtually the same.<br /><br />McCann's oats are by far the most expensive. Even after Amazon's subscriber discount, Whole Foods store brand steel cut oats, for example, are several dollars cheaper (grown in America and organic). The only difference in nutrition data is that the Whole Foods brand is insignificantly higher in calories from fat as well as fiber, protein and iron. No doubt some of the price differential has merely to do with the tin can and transporting the oats across the Atlantic.<br /><br />So if you want to save several dollars, look at other brands of of steel cut oatmeal.

review/summary: You must have this to make goetta!
review/text: There are a couple of brands of steel-cut oatmeal around but the fact is, it's the single integral ingredient in making goetta, (pronounced "GET-ta).<br /><br />Goetta is a dish mostly of the Cincinnati, Ohio region where it was originally popularized in the United States. (Cincinnati is a very German city, originally called "Porkopolis" for the numerous slaughterhouses and sausage-makers located there.) Goetta is a sort of loaf-type scrapple, utilizing sausage, ground beef and other meats for a base. Some pals of mine often make it up, using organ meat from deer that they harvest.<br /><br />I cannot assert that goetta is a huge favorite of mine but I occasionally imbibe in the sausage-type which is okay. It takes a great deal of time and trouble to make but when it's finished, you cut slices from a loaf of goetta, fry them in a bit of cooking oil or in a great knob of melted butter, and then pour pancake syrup over it, or, if you're a Hillbilly like me, good sorghum molasses. Most generally, I serve it alongside eggs-over-medium or with scrambled eggs. This dish has somehow become a big item in deer hunting camps and I know guys who will eat it three times a day during hunting excursions.<br /><br />Goetta has a long cooking time which is why regular rolled oats won't work in the recipe. In any case, you won't be making goetta without the steel-cut oats... at least not very good goetta!
