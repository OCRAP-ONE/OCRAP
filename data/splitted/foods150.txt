review/summary: excellent, aromatic and smooth
review/text: This is a high quality tea.  When you first open the can, the Bergamot scent will floor you - it is strong, but not in a bad way, it is beautifully citrus filled.  The tea leaves are the nicest I have seen in a packaged tea (not from a specialty tea store I mean).  No fragments or breakage, just nice, clean full leaves.<br /><br />Brews up just as nice as it looks, very smooth flavor, no bitterness at all.<br /><br />I recommend giving this a try if you are looking for a new tea brand, it will not disappoint!

review/summary: Not a big tea-drinker, but...
review/text: I'm not that much of a tea drinker, so count this as a non-gourmet's review. When I first started drinking tea many years ago, it quickly became clear that loose tea was head and shoulders better than bags. I soon started getting foreign but garden variety loose teas from hole-in-the-wall ethnic food stores. Oh, and Constant Comment loose when I could find it (I know, I know). Last year a friend gave me a can of Rishi Earl Grey for Christmas. Wow. The flavor is everything other commenters have described. Plus, I now know why they call them tea "leaves," not tea dust. :-) It still takes me a long time to go through a can--coffee is my preference--but I'll be ordering the three-pack soon from Amazon. One can will go back to the person who got me hooked on it, and a second can to a tea-drinker who I know will appreciate it, to spread the word. I'll keep the third can for myself, of course.

review/summary: The best Earl Grey I have had!
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker and have tried so many teas, both loose teas and bagged teas, looking for the perfect cup of Earl Grey.  Rishi hit the ball out of the park with this one.  The flavor is strong and full, but still sweet and comforting.  It is not as bitter or as harsh as many other Earl Greys.  It has a fresh taste and smell.  The tea is superbly balanced and tastes as if there is more to it than tea leaves and water.<br /><br />To compare to some other teas, to give you a better picture of what I mean, it is a fuller flavor than Bigelow, Twinnings, or Ahmad, while being not as delicate as Numi.  It does not have the synthetic taste and smell of Stash.  It is not quite as pungent and bitter as Tazo (which I do like).  Mostly, it compares to Teavana's Earl Grey Creme, which I also highly recommend, but is a more robust flavor, with less of the creamy mouth-feel.  I highly recommend this tea.

review/summary: One of the better Earl Greys
review/text: I bought this at a local store on clearance and was really pleased with the quality. It is far better than the tea bag varieties I have tried such as Twinings and Stash brands. I'd place it slightly higher than the Twinings Aromatics, which is a better quality than the yellow boxed Earl Grey version.<br /><br />I've bought a high grade Rishi Earl Grey at a higher price from a tea store, but this organic version is as good and at a lower price.

review/summary: Pricey, but delicious
review/text: First, I readily admit this is a pricey tea, but honestly, I've come across the same quality tea in teashops that is much more expensive, and they're not organic or fair trade products.<br /><br />This Earl Grey blend is smooth and delicious! I didn't use as much as the instructions said because it was too strong/bitter for my taste buds. Using half of what they said produced a lighter, smoother tea. One note: Upon first sniff of the tea leaves, the citrus note is STRONG, but it's more balanced in the flavor of the tea.<br /><br />The packaging is nice and keeps the tea fresh.<br /><br />The size of the tea leaves is adequate. I don't end up with a lot of "tea dust" at the bottom of my cup. This "tea dust" does increase as you use the tea and get farther down in the tin (I assume this is because the smaller pieces naturally tend to settle toward the bottom of the packaging in shipment).<br /><br />Overall, a nice blend! I recommend adding a little dried lavendar blossoms to create a wonderful Lavender Earl Grey.

review/summary: An atypical Earl Grey
review/text: Cracking the tin gave the first indication that this as a different Earl Grey. The tin aroma was a 'bright' citrus as opposed the the usual 'darker, earthier' citrus I have encountered with other Earl Greys. I don't know if it's a different strain of bergamot, if it's processed differently, but the nose is almost tangerine-like in its brightness.<br /><br />The nose translates well to the flavor, though the bergamot difference is less obvious here.  I found the balance to be good, though I've noticed that it seems to get unusually tannic/bitter with just slight oversteeping,(so watch that brew time closely.)<br /><br />I think I'm going to have to investigate more of Rishi's products.<br /><br />Recommended

review/summary: A fine, high quality Earl Grey
review/text: I've always enjoyed a good cup of Earl Grey (especially when coupled with a good book) but have not really gotten loose leaf before. This Rishi Earl Grey is very nice, not overly heavy with no licorice undertones that I really find unappealing in some Earl Gery varieties. The tea takes four minutes to steep, and when done is quite aromatic. I would recommend this one without reservation.<br /><br />*****Update 10-10-2009*****<br /><br />I had to come update this review to express how much I LOVE this tea. It's easily one of the most enjoyable teas I've experienced (I'm drinking a cup of it as I update this review) and it always makes me happy when I brew a cup. This is a lovely tea!

review/text: Pros:<br />- Blown away from the intensive taste compared to Lipton brands<br />- Great smell<br />- Leafs are relatively large so they do not fall through and end up in your tea.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- STAINS anything and everything<br /><br />I never tried this type of tea, but WOW.  When you brew this tea my fiance and I actually said "WHOA!" out loud.  The leafs are perfect size and makes brewing it very easy.<br /><br />IMO I would classify this tea as a winter tea as when I drink it I just wish snow was falling and I am drinking my tea to warm up. :)<br /><br />I cant give it 5 star mainly because of how fast and dark this tea stains our cups.  You have to make sure you clean your cups right away or else this tea will stain, A LOT.  I accidentally spilled some tea on our floor, and it actually stained the floor :(  Of course this would be considered User Error and the draw back of using an actual organic good tea, but now I have to make sure I can find the cups that have already been stained so I dont stain any more.<br /><br />Overall: Get it. I will make sure I always have one in the house.

review/summary: Fabulous packaging & overpowering bergamot....
review/text: First of all- I love tea, particularly Earl Grey and variations of Earl Grey...<br /><br />This tea contains Yunnan province black tea and bergamot essential oil.<br /><br />This is a loose tea and the packaging is lovely.  While I have had many loose teas that come in tins, I do appreciate that under the outer cap, this tin has an additional metal stopper that is very easily removed but also prevents an explosion of tea leaves.<br /><br />The stopper not only serves as a seal, it is also useful in measuring the tea for brewing- this little inner stopper holds approximately 1 Tablespoon of tea (not packed, fairly loose...I measured it as I was curious...) which is the recommended amount for 8oz of water and proper brewing... Many folks do not like tea because they have not had properly brewed tea, so this is an impressive extra measure to ensure the brew is as intended...<br /><br />When you open the container the bergamot hits you in the face...I was hoping the overwhelming bergamot would settle down during the brew, but I still found that it was overwhelming to the point of being excessively perfumey (for me it was like being trapped in a small space with someone who bathed in a bottle of eau de anything)... It was quite drinkable when I attempted to get past the bergamot slap, and the Yunnan black tea was smooth and rich and delightful...Not bitter in the least, and very flavorful and tasty... Unfortunately, I could not get past the overwhelming bergamot... But I plan on trying some of Rishi Tea's other varieties as I do like this varietal of Yunnan black tea...<br /><br />I do also appreciate that this is USDA organic, Fair Trade certified and the tin tells the story of the tea and the people who cultivate it...<br /><br />I prefer my Earl Grey to be more balanced, with the tea aspect or the bergamot in harmony....

review/summary: An Excellent Tea
review/text: Not all Earl Grey teas are created equal. Because the bergamot oil can mask a less than stellar leaf, many tea companies do not use really high quality tea leaves for their Earl Grey.<br /><br />Rishi uses a solid leaf from Yunnan for their Earl Grey, a hearty black tea which comes from the same region as Puerh tea comes from. As a result you can easily get 2 full steeping from these leaves.<br /><br />The tea has a nice balanced flavor, the bergamot isn't overpowering and it compliments the sweetness of the Yunnan tea. Prior to the Rishi I was purchasing Mighty Leaf's Earl Grey and I have to say that I prefer the Rishi. It all boils down to the choice of tea leaves (which should seem obvious) but Rishi's choice and the price point of this tea make it THE Earl Grey to beat!

review/text: My sister is the real tea drinker in the family, I lean more toward coffee. But I was attracted to the idea of this tea: a Fair Trade product, totally organic, described as "bold and sweetly smooth," and I wanted to give it a try. Once I had opened the lid (double lid, actually) on the neat looking can and saw the incredibly dark and aromatic leaves, I knew I wanted this all to myself. True to its promise this Earl Grey tea is delicious. A strong tea, a smooth tea, no bitterness (my usual complaint about tea in general), and really does not need the addition of lemon, milk or sweetener - as a matter of fact, I think that would hide some of the more nuanced flavors I tasted here. I will definitely keep a can of this on hand for myself..... and I may even buy one for my sister.

review/text: I've tasted many varieties of Earl Grey tea, and I would have to say this one is the best. When they mention that this product has a "bergamot citrus" aroma, they surely don't mess around. It indeed packs a nice, powerful punch. Upon opening it, I almost had to catch my breath. My grandmother could even smell it across the room. Very delightful and very strong in its flavor and fragrance. This tea is powerful enough in strength to where it eliminates the need to use a lot of leaves. I feel that it will last me for quite some time. When you add the fact that it's kosher, fair trade, and USDA certified organic, I feel all the more better about it.

review/summary: Passed the Japanese housewife test with flying colors
review/text: As I'm not much of a tea drinker, so I gave this to my wife (who is from Japan) to try out before I tried it myself.<br /><br />In Japan, tea is a big deal.  The tea (the leaves as well as the tea itself) has to look good, smell good, and overall present itself as something of great refinement.  No Japanese would offer another person tea that was less than wonderful, except maybe at the office.<br /><br />If the eyes are the window to the soul for Americans, the tea a person serves is the window to the soul of Japanese people.<br /><br />So my real expectation was that my wife would open up the canister, maybe try some herself once, and it just wouldn't pass enough to serve to anyone else.  Wow, was I wrong.<br /><br />She opened it up with her friend, who is also from Japan, with the disclaimer that I got it from Amazon.  Clever Japanese strategy.  If it was coffee, I'd be offended as coffee is my thing, but tea is alright.<br /><br />They loved it right away.  They said, "Come here.  Smell this.  It's a wonderful aroma."  They added a few obligatory potential criticisms like, "This isn't from Japan I suppose."  And then they drank it.<br /><br />You have to understand, these two ladies drink nothing but the best.  It has to be great or they wont serve it.<br /><br />My wife has served me this tea every day since.  It's that good.

review/summary: Bright-eyed bergamot, packed for freshness.
review/text: While not the finest Earl Grey out there, it sure is packaged for maximum appeal.  The petite cylindrical canister  is sized just right for glorified-spice-rack tea cabinet storage, with artwork that's just short of overwrought. Pop off the top, and lo: it's double-hulled, requiring an extra bit of effort for each pot brewed.  Special!  This second satisfying-pop comes complete with a wallop of sharp, nose-tingling bergamot.<br />Regular tea drinkers may find Rishi's Earl Grey most suitable as garnish to a darker, fuller-bodied tea (a couple of spoons on top of some PG Tips makes for a nice afternoon pick-me-up). Otherwise they may find they go through a can a week, at best.<br /><br />Alone, this tea brews to an orangeish hue, no darker, and always tastes slightly understeeped, or overmilked.  I tried to oversteep, but no dice: It's as if the tea's been neutered, the merest hint of tannin erased. It's unnerving.<br /><br />If you want a tea that will pretty much always present pretty well, and are willing to pay extra for that pritnear peace of mind, Rishi's Earl Grey is a good bet.  If you like more involvement with your tea -- attention to leaf volume, water temperature, steeping time, ratio of additives, etc. -- stick with Twinings, Numi, or Taylors of Harrogate.

review/text: Both my husband and I drink tea every morning from a  pot. I wanted to get an organic, fair trade tea, but have been disappointed in the past.  After reading  the Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E20O">Rishi Tea Organic Black Tea, Earl Grey Loose Tea, 3.3-Ounce Tin (Pack of 3)</a>reviews for this tea, Rishi Earl Grey organic, I thought I'd take a chance and buy the three pack.  We both loved the tea. We were drinkning the Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey tea, which we liked, but it wasn't organic.  This Rishi Earl Grey is similar in that it's not too perfumy of an Earl Grey. It really has a great flavor.  We both drink it with just milk.  I think that tea depends a lot on the water you use too.  We have well water and it's filtered.  Also the tin that the tea comes is has two lids, which keeps the tea fresher, longer.  Yum can't wait 'til morning.

While the Bergamot is center stage, the tea itself is first-rate.  When you open the can, be prepared to meet a fully-formed and highly complex Earl Grey.  If you have been drinking "retail" Earl Grey, this one will bowl you over.  Every time I enjoy a cup, I'm so happy I made this purchase.  FYI, I have found that 2 teaspoons steeped for about 3 minutes in a cup of water delivers a perfect product, flavorful, but never over-powering or bitter.  If you like Earl Grey, try this product!

review/summary: So good
review/text: I found an excellent infuser and loose leaf Earl Grey all in the same day. This may become my daily tea. Does well on a 2nd steeping- still smooth and slightly smokey, not at all bitter tea flavor comes through nicely with maybe a bit less bergamot zing than the first time, still very tasty. You can really tell the difference on teas like this one which use real bergamot, especially of good quality. And a decent black tea is often missing in even some of Earl Greys with good bergamot, which is sometimes used to hide inferior leaves. Rishi included high quality in both departments, so the tea carries through on its own even after the spicy citrus does its work. It may be a bit strong for some, and I wouldn't know what is considered better from a traditional point of view (I'm not British), but it's just right for me. My favorite Earl Grey to date.

Well balanced and complex but still hearty with a wonderful lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />I love that you can brew the same leaves multiple times, it increases the value. I can usually brew this tea 4 times before it gets too weak.<br /><br />They recommend a 4 minute brew time which I've found to be too strong the first brew. I usually go 3min/4min/4min/6min on my first through fourth brewing.<br /><br />That's just what works for me.

review/summary: Excellent Earl Grey
review/text: This Rishi Earl Grey seems to be better than other brands that I have tried in the past.  (In the past, I have tried other brands like The Coffee Bean & The Tea Leaf, Twinings, and few others easily found in my local supermarket.)  The fragrance is very nice without becoming overpowering and it tastes smooth and light.<br /><br />If you want to make the brew 'heavier', try adding 'heavier' tea like Yorkshire Tea (I think other English Breakfast Tea types should work as well), although do not add too much or it may become too strong, unless you want to also add milk.  Although I have not tried yet, I am considering mixing this Early Grey with Assam sometime in the future.  Experiment, experiment, and experiment.

review/text: Absolutely outstanding, if you like the aroma of Bergamot.  Despite the extemely strong aroma, the Bergamot flavor is not overwhelming (Taylor's aroma is milder, but its Bergamot flavor is completely overwhelming). Most Earl Grey is too subtile for me.<br /><br />Bergamot is probably a learned appreciation.  It is from citrus like a cross between an orange and a lime, with a powerful aroma and flavor of its own (inedible as fruit).<br /><br />You can still taste the tea, and it is great quality.  Add to this Fair Trade, Organic,and a great price, it can't be equaled.<br /><br />So if you like Bergamot aroma, and want enough Bergamot flavor to tell it's there, don't bother looking at anything else.

review/text: A very rich flavor, I am biased as I like Earl Grey Tea.  It's great for an after dinner tea, a little too heavy (for me) to be used in the early morning.  I found Rishi Tea to be flavorful and robust.  I wasn't previously a loose leaf tea drinker, but I'm now looking for the perfect set so I can start brewing the leaves at work.  It's also a perfect tea for the heavy coffee drinker who is looking for something different once-in-a-while.  Highly recommended.

review/text: I was never much of a tea person.  My experiences with tea have been limited to Lipton, Community, some Bigelow, Celestial Seasonings and whatever brand that happens to be in use at the restuarants I visit.  With Rishi's Earl Grey, I ventured into my first loose leaf tea experience.<br /><br />Culled from 1300 year old trees of the Yunnan mountain villages, this Earl Grey is strong, almost sweetened coffee-like in taste.  If there's no coffee around, this tea would be my next choice.  It contains bergamot oil as well.  It has a stout aroma that hits you before you even open the inner lid of the container.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea to fans of dark teas in general, as well as folks like myself who are more familiar with coffee and biscuits than tea and crumpets.

review/text: A delicate aroma greeted me when I opened the can of this tea. The flavor was different than that of any other Earl Grey tea I've tried. This is the reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 - basically it's not what I expected. Perhaps bergamot citrus was what set it apart from other companies. However though it's different it was very good. Tangy and flavorful, it seemed to get better with every sip. I don't usually add anything to the tea (no sugar, sweeteners, milk, etc.), but this tea in particular truly didn't need any additions. I am planning to try other teas from Rishi.

review/summary: Rishi Tea - Great Earl Grey
review/text: Opening the second, tightly sealed, metal lid on the organic Earl Grey by Rishi Tea, the aromatic fragrance of fresh tea and bergamot citrus which characterize this blend filled the air.  The resulting brew did not disappoint; it was smooth and rich with a citrus tang.  I followed the directions exactly, pouring rapidly boiling water over a tablespoon of leaves placed in my infuser, and allowing it to steep for four minutes. The cup of tea was enhanced by the awareness that, in addition to enjoying the fine flavor, I was supporting an ethnic Chinese family by using an organic, Fair Trade Certified product.  It was a win-win situation - great tea and ecological balance.  (The package was even correct in promising that the leaves could withstand a second steep!)

The beautiful long leaves were impressive. I don't care for the fragrance of bergamot to dominate, I would say it was well balanced in this tea, but somehow the overall flavor was...nice.<br /><br />For this company and price, I expected an Ooh & Ahh moment upon inhaling the fragrance and taking the first sip. Their silver needle jasmine was exquisite.<br /><br />In a blind taste test, Twinnings humble tea bag would clobber it.

review/summary: Bold, but very pleasant
review/text: Earl Grey Tea can be overwhelming. Generally, when an Earl Grey calls itself "Bold", they aren't joking. Personally, if there is too much bergamot oil in the tea, it is too overpowering for me to drink. I like to drink an aromatic tea, not a cup of perfume. The Rishi Earl Grey tea is described as "bold and sweetly smooth with an enlivening aroma of bergamot citrus." I think that sums it up very well. I was a little concerned when I popped the lid on the tin, as the scent was very powerful.  However, it is a pleasant smelling tea that does not overwhelm me when the cup reaches the mouth. I can taste a high quality, rich black tea with sweet and lightly citrus tones.<br /><br />I also feel good about drinking this tea because it is a Fair Trade Certified tea that is shade grown from heirloom tea trees. It's organic as well as Kosher. Rishi also says this tea can be steeped multiple times, so this tea is also very economical. I'll definitely be trying more Rishi teas.

review/text: As others have commented, the bergamot scent is truly impressive in this tea.  The lovely metal tin indeed has two lids -- the usual one over the top, and then an inner, inset metal lid sealing the leaves in.  Opening it revealed a flood of sweet and citrus-y bergamot and a view of beautiful, large, dark teak leaves.  I brewed according to directions, and uploaded a photo above to show you the gorgeous amber tea and the huge leaves, nicely plumped from the hot water.  The tea was strongly scented with bergamot, yet I could still taste good clean black tea through it.  I highly recommend this tasty tea, which also happens to be organic and "fair trade certified."

review/text: I am very picky about the tea I drink my favorite being Ahmad English #1. After trying this tea, to my surprise and delight I may have found another favorite!<br /><br />This tea is very smooth with low acidity and it goes a long way. This is a loose tea and it brews up wonderfully in the Bodum double wall infuser cup. You can make several cups of tea with just a heaping teaspoon of this loose tea and each cup tastes great without being weak.<br /><br />The lemony bergomot is a lovely subtle addition that tastes and smells wonderful. The tea has a beautiful dark amber color and a full rounded flavor without the acidic bite some tea can have.<br /><br />At first the price seemed a bit high but after using it and seeing how little you actually need to use I would recommend this highly as a great value and consider it for gift giving. Then again once you try it you may not want to give it away. Very enjoyable tea!

review/summary: What a great aroma in the tin and wonderful flavor in the cup!
review/text: Reading the label was an experience in its self.  Great information about the location of the tea trees and the culture around their 1600 year existence.  The tea leaves are appealing to the eye and the hand.  The aroma of the bergamot is strong yet light with a apple, citrus blend that feels like it would be good in any season of the year.  The Earl Grey tea when brewed is quite nice with good strong flavor and the aroma of the bergamot remains for us to enjoy a little longer.  Since bergamot oils have been used to help with stuffy noses and other medicinal purposes, this will work well in Southern California in the Spring and Fall with the Santa Ana Winds that cause so much havoc with our sinuses.  Then, again, in the Winter with flu and colds.<br />The tin has two lids to help keep the freshness in.  The inner lid seems to have more that one job; first is to help you not spill the loose tea everywhere when opening the outside lid.  Then it looks like it might be a measuring cup for use of a 11 ounce mug.  So I tried it and it seemed just right or slightly stronger than I'd like but drank it anyway and felt rejuvenated each afternoon.<br />I have thoroughly enjoyed the bold and smooth flavor of this tea and will look forward to trying other blends in the Rishi Tea line of products.

review/summary: Perfect Balance
review/text: Rishi is a wonderful tea company.  They are one of the best of the best.  Earl Grey is no exception when it comes to their line.  It starts by being double sealed to retain freshness and aroma and doesn't stop there.  It is a premium black tea with just the right mix of bergamot for a crisp, citrus note.  I have had Earl Grey's that overuse the bergamot to hide a less than sterling low note of underpar black tea to try and carry the flavor.  RISHI does it right.  You can have a taste and aroma experience, perfectly balanced to deliver maximum satisfaction.  I normally like a little raw sugar or honey in my tea, but this beautiful blend can stand on its own.  Nothing needed here but boiling water and a short wait to enjoy an excellent tea experience.  Well done RISHI!

This is one of the very best Earl Grey teas I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. It comes in a lovely container, and upon opening it, there is a wonderful fragrance of tea and orange bergamont. The quality of this tea is outstanding, and it makes a very invigorating cup of tea. I used one tablespoon and steeped it in boiling hot water for five minutes. I like my Earl Grey with a little milk and organic stevia (a natural sweetener), and honestly, I was in heaven sipping this. There are a lot of mediocre Earl Grey teas out there, but this one is truly top shelf. Don't hesitate to purchase this if you're a fan of this intoxicating tea!

review/summary: Strong and bold quite suitable for Starship Captains
review/text: I always thought that Captain Picard was a bit of a wimp for preferring Earl Grey tea but when made according to the detailed instructions  this version is a rather "Manly" tea. Very strong with a bit of an edge, quite suitable for Star ship Captains, gentleman adventurers and  with a little extra water the rest of us too. I like it better sweetened than unsweetened and think it needs sugar and/or milk to smooth it out. The Bergamont flavoring is a bit strong in my opinion but if you like an intense Earl Grey version, this might be just your cup of tea ( I had to say that).<br />There is quite a bit of caffeine in it so it might not be the best bedtime beverage. This tea Goes well with classic tea accompaniments such as cookies, cakes, cucumber and ham finger sandwiches etc. and would also be good to accompany a meal.  Not really the tea you would choose to serve with sushi except for that style of California Roll  that is made with chopped crab (or Kreb surimi) and Mayonnaise, Which was really enhanced when served with this tea.

The aroma that escaped upwards from the can was heavenly; delicate, alluring, definitely Earl Grey but with whispers of bergamot, a lemony, citrusy warmth that made me feel good immediately. I put aside all other endeavours for a time and gave myself up to a retreat with this wonderful light tea. Don't brew it more than 4 minutes; let the essence of the bergamot exude from the tea. Both your sense of taste and your sense of smell will be the better for having indulged in this tea. A lovely cap on a grey, ugly day.<br /><br />Rishi Earl Grey Tea is 100% Organic Fair Trade tea, grown by and harvested by the ethnic peoples of the Yunnan Province of China from tea trees planted in 696 A.D. By buying Fair Trade teas, the minority peoples who grow the tea benefit, through community developments and direct trade. The benefit to the purchaser is in knowing that they are doing a good thing for the earth and for the small farmer. I've just started seeing Fair Trade items coming onto the market, and I try to patronize the small farmer. You won't be cutting any corners by drinking this tea; it's truly a great beverage. It also says on the can that one serving can be used multiple times, so don't cavalierly throw it out after the first cup. Very recommended.

review/summary: Robust Earl Grey
review/text: Of all the Earl Grey's I've tried, this and Tazo's version are the most robust. If you like the distinctive flavor of bergamont, but wish it were more pronounced than in the conventional blend, and your not opposed to some extra tannins, then this or Tazo are your Earl Greys of choice. Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my favorite is Bigelow's. My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. However, I have to knock Revolution by trying cut costs by not including a string with their tea bags. If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont. I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception). Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves.

review/summary: rishi tea Earl Grey organic
review/text: I received a tin of this Rishi Organic Earl Grey loose tea as a gift a year ago.  I have enjoyed it immensely.  Having lived abroad, I have become accustomed to brewing loose tea, as well as using tea bags.  I love this tea so much that I only brewed it once in a while as a special treat, so as not to use it up all at once.  I wish it was decaffeinated, but other than that, it is truly enjoyable.  Because I like a weaker tea, I only use maybe less than a teaspoon per pot.  The aroma is great also.  The fact that this tea is organic is a bonus.

review/text: This is the most delicious Earl Grey tea I have ever tasted. The aroma is wonderful, and the amount of bergamot in this blend is perfect. I use about one and one half tablespoons in my 17 ounce tea press and steep for 4 minutes. You can use less or more tea, to taste. I love the fact that I can re-steep the same tea leaves a second time, and enjoy another pot of tea that is as delicious as the first. If you are already an Earl Grey fan, I promise you will not be disappointed. If you have never tried Earl Grey, why not start at the top? Enjoy!

Then for Christmas 2007 I ordered a package of three tins, I love it so much!

That's HOT, for us) with this tea. The aroma is unbelievable... flowery, spicy... and the flavor is quite good... Earl Grey with a kick. YUM.<br /><br />OK. The smell and taste of this is Earl Grey tea... what do you expect? The selling point is the organic, fair trade aspect. Also, the elimination of the middle-man, but I'd have to review the books before I'd believe that. I am fortunate enough to be in a situation where I can afford to support these important principles. If you are too, then buy this instead of non-organic, non-fair trade.<br />Hmm, after previewing I tried to change my star rating to 5... I mean, it's the principle of the thing... but I was not able to.

review/text: I have had many different versions of Earl Grey tea and I am a fan, so when I read such raving reviews as this tea has received I had to try it. I now have three canisters of this Rishi version of Earl Grey and perhaps I will be more impressed by the second or third canister; so far however, I am not impressed. As I suspect, perhaps I received a stale batch, but the product I have been drinking is definitely not superior to Trader Joe's "Earl Grey Tea" bags in terms of strength or flavor.

review/summary: The Best Condiment with Lamb
review/text: This product from Ye Olde England is simply the best condiment for accompanying lamb roasts. It has a very delicious upfront mint tang as opposed to those icky-sweet plain mint and apple/mint jellies most of us are accustomed to having with our lamb. Forget those mostly corn syrup and "mint flavored" concoctions and opt for this traditional English condiment. As I said it is tangy and sweet all-in-one. Mostly because it is just mint leaves ground into a delicious paste and some vinegar and sugar added for just the right combination of flavor. A perfect addition to the mildest to gamier cuts of lamb. Try it, and enjoy it!

review/summary: Stronger than the Americano capsules, slightly bitter
review/text: The Dolce Gusto Caffe Lungo capsules are awesome. This is a strong coffee, a caffe lungo is a "long coffee" or big coffee that Europeans drink. It's like their everyday coffee. The caffe lungo is meant to be a stronger tasting, somewhat bitter coffee. It means business. So if you like a strong, slightly bitter coffee in the morning like I do, it's wonderful. Now. Because the Dolce Gusto machine lets YOU decide how much water to add, you can further control the strength and therefore bitterness. Obviously, the more water you add, the more mild the coffee will be. I suggest that when you first get the machine, you experiment with strength by using a pyrex measuring cup. They suggest adding 4oz of water, but obviously you can add however much or however little water your heart desires to suit your tastes. Apparently, Europeans are not sitting around enjoying big mugs like Americans are. I think they simply drink more cups throughout the day.<br /><br />At any rate, this is a wonderful, full-bodied and slightly bitter coffee. I makes a wonderful crema layer. (the froth you get from a pressure-brewed coffee) You certainly can't get this from a k-cup or Keurig (drip brew) system. I love this first thing in the morning when I need a sock in the eye to wake me up!

review/text: Along with the Macchiato flavor, this is my favorite. A very pleasant drink. As the label suggests, this is a good "morning cup of coffee." I've been drinking it regularly most mornings for a couple of weeks and still enjoy it. The standard recommended serving size for this one is pretty small (only 4 ounces). The recommended Americano portion is 6 ounces, which I prefer. The flavor is dark and rich and really wakes you up in the morning. It also develops a nice cream on top at the end of brewing. Yummy!<br /><br />5/5

review/summary: Very strong flavor, but not bitter
review/text: I prefer my coffee black.  Usually, I turn to my Keurig for a great cup of rich black coffee.  However, the Dolce Gusto does a nice cup of unadorned coffee, as well.  The Caffee Lungo is, indeed, a very nice, naked coffee.  For my taste, though, it is a bit to strongly  flavored.  The frothiness is not altogether to my liking.  However, with a bit of milk and sugar the Lungo is very tasty, indeed.<br /><br />There are two ways to brew it.  The smaller cup is the "Americano" while the larger is the Caffee Lungo.  A frothy "Americano" seems a bit odd but it is tasty, if a bit to strong.<br /><br />Remember, the strength of the flavor is largely a result of a dark roasting.  A rule of thumb is the darker the roast the less caffeine in the  coffee.<br /><br />Anyway, the Dolce Gusto continues to impress me.

review/text: Nescafe Dolce Gusto Caffe Lungo is not my morning choice for coffee. For mornings, I like a stronger coffee to really kick off the day, but when it comes to an afternoon pick-me-up, I prefer a medium coffee and the Nescafe Dolce Gusto Caffe Lungo fills that nicely. The instructions suggest you do a 4 oz. pull for a Lungo or a 6 oz. pull for an Americano. Somewhere in between works well for me.<br /><br />The coffee has got a slight sharpness to it, but definitely not overwhelming. Like the espresso for the same machine, this blend has nutty hints in the coffee. Overall, it's a nice afternoon blend.

review/text: Dolce Gusto's Caffee Lungo is their version of plain Ol' Coffee. It is pretty weak flavor, so I didn't really like it--No where near bold enough, lacks flavor. My dad, loved it. So when I need instant coffee, I will be reaching for the espresso pods instead and just pulling 6 ounces (Americano-ish).<br /><br />So while Dolce Gusto will likely replace most of the useage of my espresso machine, I doubt it will make much of a dent in my drip coffee pot's usage, as Caffe Lungo just doesn't measure up.

I am a tea drinker, but like my coffee on a chillier day, and since we've been plagued with cold weather here in the Northeast, I've been enjoying alot of coffee in the mornings!  That being said, I usually brew up a Keurig K-Cup of Donut people coffee (great coffee as well), but decided to go a full week with Caffe Lungo.  I'm happy to report that it is great!  Tastes like fresh brewed coffee from the pot or from the store.  I loved the flavor as much as my beloved Donut people coffee.  Very nice cup of coffee indeed.  My only problem is that Nescafe isn't easy to find where I am and therefore I have to order on Amazon.  Not that it is a problem to order, but I would like to be able to pick one up localy when I run out.

I also like this because it is just the coffee - no superfluous milk capsules to lay around and take up space.  This is definitely a repeat flavor for me.  Reminds me of the Nespresso "Livanto" flavor which used to be my favorite.

I was quite surprised at the quality and could drink this everyday. The amount of crema also exceeded what the Senseo produces by a significant amount.<br /><br />I also felt very satisfied after one cup of this although I normally drink a couple of cups of coffee in the morning. For around 50 cents a cup, I would much rather have this than Starbucks any day.<br /><br />Although Nescafe does not have nearly enough varieties of coffee for their Dolce Gusto, this one is a winner.

We do not drink more than a cup of coffee in a given day, but some of us do like frou-frou coffee now and then.  However, this is not really that type of coffee. I actually prefer my coffee served black, with no sugar, creamer/milk, so I am probably a little more biased.  I think this flavor suits my basic taste range for coffee overall, although I've tasted better.

review/summary: Some days I like it better than other days
review/text: I understand that a lungo is a long espresso. This is also touted as being an "Americano" by running more water through it. I guess a purist may not agree with that, but then again a purist probably isn't using this machine. I like it most days, Americano style...it is a nice morning cup of coffee...nice frothy top and good flavor. It does sort of remind you of watered down strong coffee (rather than a milder blend) and some days that is the reason I don't like it, but different people have different tastes. So I also have a Keurig, but like the foamy-ness of this Lungo, none of my Keurig k-cups get a froth. This and the Chococino are the ones I choose most often...I am not into the milky ones.

review/summary: Not Amazing
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:31 Mins<br /><br /></span>Maybe living in Seattle has made me a bit of a coffee snob, but this caffe lungo does not really impress!<br /><br />See video for demonstration.<br /><br />The instructions have two ways to pull the beverage. 4 ounces for a "long espresso" (this is a lungo) or 6 ounces for an Americano. (Note: this is not actually an Americano which is hot water added to espresso, it's a just a longer lungo)<br />I have tried preparing the beverage in both ways. The 6 oz pull results in a coffee that is not strong enough and is slightly watery... The 4 oz way is definitely much stronger but still is far from bold or full-bodied. I still prefer my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E3ZF76">Lello 1375 Ariete Cafe Prestige</a> which gives me the flexibility of using whichever beans I prefer. One of my favorites (besides some local roasters) is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002E2FH0">Lavazza Super Crema</a> which is a much bolder and full-bodied coffee.

review/summary: Very Mediocre
review/text: Out of the 5 flavors I tried with the Dolce Gusto machine, this one is definitely the weak link. I did not enjoy the flavor at all - it sort of tasted like stale coffee that sat out for several hours, but was still hot.<br /><br />I tried playing a barista and adjusting coffee levels, but it came out bad every time. A very disappointing flavor, and one that I will not use again. Also, I've noticed that these Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffees have a pretty short shelf life, some shorter than others. So stocking up is not an option.

review/summary: Barely drinkable.
review/text: I decided to use this flavor to test the Krups/Nescafe's "iced" option -- room temp water pressure as opposed to hot -- because every once in a while I like a decaf iced coffee, which means buying an iced decaf Americano (I know this isn't decaf) in most shops.<br /><br />This is the Krups/Nescafe "equivalent" (I use that term loosely) to an Americano if you use a larger volume of water than for the Lungo.<br /><br />In short, I could barely swallow this stuff.  Cold-pressed, it tastes like end-of-the-day convenience store coffee that has been watered down.  Absolutely terrible.<br /><br />Trying it hot only yields marginally better results.<br /><br />The only reason it got 2 stars from me is because I'm impressed with the Krups process.  However, I still cannot fathom why a great manufacturer, Krups, chose to partner up on this project with an instant coffee company (Nescafe).  This flavor is the worst so far BY far.

review/summary: Basic Disguist...Go Green Mountain!
review/text: This is supposed to be a pretty basic and standard cup of coffee for the Krups machine, but was undrinkable.  I will take Green Mountain coffee over this any day.  Even my husband who is not picky with his coffee at all could not drink this.  He even tried putting creamer and sugar and could not disguise the taste.

review/summary: Mislead
review/text: I bought this product because it was listed as the coffee capsules for the Nespresso coffee maker.  It wasn't!  The capsules were too big.  When I contacted Amazon they told me I couldn't return the product, but gave me a partial refund. (Okay)  When I told them they were advertising for the wrong coffee maker, they said I could contact the manufacturer. These capsules are probably great, for the right coffee maker, but not I'm not happy that I was mislead.

review/summary: slow to ship and not as fresh as expected
review/text: Ordered this item as a birthday gift and "thought" I had allowed ample time for shipping however that didn't end up the case.  Arrived 2 days after it was expected & needed and the box was delivered & sat outside in 90 degree heat for several hours...not so great for chocolate coating!  I would have thought they'd package with a cool pack during the summer.?.  This tin size does hold a lot of toffee though!  Just wish the toffee had been more fresh tasting but I'm sure the heat didn't help the stale texture - like when you get an old Butterfinger bar.  Perhaps if it hadn't been summer & sat outside in the heat it may have been better.  Can only give it a 3 star rating because of the negatives.

review/summary: Taste
review/text: Unfortunately I am highly disappointed with this product. It is devoid of flavor. They pride themselves on the history of the product. I could've done better at my grocery store in the candy aisle. I would've actually preferred a Heath bar. I tried it on three different days thinking possibly it was me. Then I had a couple friends try a couple pieces and my assessment was proved to be correct.<br />I threw away the majority of the two pound container one hour before the trash collectors arrived so the Raccoons (which often find their way into the garbage no matter what precautions you take) wouldn't have to suffer eating it.<br />What a waste of my hard-earned money. You'll notice if you search Google how dominant this company is.<br />Believe me, I nor will anyone I know ever waste a penny on this product again. Yes, this review seems harsh; but I rarely take the time to do this. The only reason I have, is so you don't waste your money.<br />Regards to all:<br />Ron

review/summary: Great taste, great price
review/text: This recipe is my favorite. I bought 5 boxes of this flavor during last years deer hunting season. Everyone who tried this was impressed with the flavor. I did add some liquid smoke, some salt, and additional cayenne pepper to some of my batches.  I make enough deer jerky to fill up (8) 1-gallon bags every season and this is by far the best I have tried to date

The potatoes are great for making fried potatoes, adding to stews or potatoes with cheese added on top. Would recommend this and give it 5 stars. Quick substitute for not having to peel potatoes.
