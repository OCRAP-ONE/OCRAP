review/text: This product (as you can see in the photos) has 41 grams of carbs. 5 of those are fiber which can be subtracted from the total carb count, but there's 36 grams remaining!<br /><br />If you're serious about keeping your carbs down this is not for you. There's a good reason why this tastes like regular pasta.... IT IS!!<br /><br />Try Atkins or Carbanada, those are both low carb at under 7grams.

review/summary: Unbelievably Potent :)
review/text: Recently, after speaking with the owner of a local Chinese restaurant, I inquired about their outrageously HOT mustard served only upon request.  I was curious to find out if and where I could purchase this condiment to enjoy at home.  The owner explained that the mustard was prepared daily from a powder simply mixed with water to the desired consistency.  Having been repeatedly disappointed with the mainstream bottled grocery varieties labelled as "hot", a little online research certainly paid off! This ISN'T that lame packet mustard you commonly find in the bottom of your take out bag.  S&B oriental mustard ROCKS!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Nice 3oz quantity for personal home use for dipping, sauces, etc. [A little will go a very long way]<br />* Sturdy and airtight canister for storage<br />* "Scald Your Sinuses Hot" [Assuming you enjoy this trait--sure hope you do]<br />* Flexibility to freshly prepare only the amount needed at a given time--prepared mustard will lose potency/heat if stored over time.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Powder should be handled with care--seriously potent and cannot imagine getting powder directly into eyes, cuts, etc. Children and novices beware!<br /><br />Would certainly recommend to any and all of those folks [you know who you are] like myself who derive pleasure from a truly HOT mustard for dipping, egg rolls, spicy Chex mix, and other creative recipe ideas. CANNOT BEAT IT! :)

review/summary: Best Chinese mustard
review/text: I used to buy this product in the grocery store until they stopped carrying it.  We have tried so many different brands of Oriental hot mustard and never found one that we liked, but they were available in the grocery store.  Their quality never came close to the S&B brand.  I decided to look online for the S&B brand and found it here.  I will continue to purchase the S&B brand and no longer experiment with other brands.  We both think there is no comparison for the taste and consistency.

review/summary: Just like the hot mustard I love in Chinese restaurants
review/text: Despite my constant polite reminders, when making deliveries, my favorite Chinese-food restaurant often fails to include hot yellow mustard to compliment the sweet and sour sauce that typically comes with egg rolls and other side dishes. I'd tried several bottled mustard products, looking for something comparable to what I've had in Chinese restaurants, and found all of them disappointing. After doing some further research, I learned that when exposed to water, the intense chemicals which give hot mustard its spice begins to break down almost immediately, although refrigeration can delay that process. So I ordered this S&B Oriental Hot Mustard powder, which comes in a small tin with a traditional pry-off lid (under which was a modern vacuum-sealed foil/plastic liner).<br /><br />As I write this review, my sinus cavities are nicely cleared, and my tummy is nicely full of nicely spiced, digesting egg roll: This is the real deal, and it has a serious kick to it. I thought it would be inconvenient as compared to a bottled (pre-mixed) product, but this is just dirt simple -- or perhaps I should say, "mud simple": a little powder mixed with just enough cold water to moisten it, and you can smell this stuff start to react. Within moments, and certainly well before my egg rolls had begun to cool, I had a mustard paste that looked and tasted exactly like what I like to find in those condiment pots on the tables of traditional Chinese restaurants.

review/text: This mustard is perfect - just what I was looking for.<br /><br />I live in a small town with one Chinese restaurant.  I have no idea why (ordered incorrectly, cheaper, etc.) but they got regular yellow hot dog mustard instead of hot mustard that they include with their meals for dipping.  Gross.<br /><br />I searched the town to no avail - no one had hot Oriental mustard.<br /><br />So I ordered this.  And it is wonderful!  Just what I needed.  Just mix with a little bit of water and that's it.  I can't wait to add it to my own dishes cooked at home either.<br /><br />It's very hot!  Which is great!  A little goes a long ways.

review/text: Received this item promptly and was very pleased to get it. The mustard is good and hot. Directions say to use cold water to mix, but I used warm water from a tea kettle that had cooled and the results were very good with no lumping. It isn't mustard if it's not hot! The only thing I was concerned about was that there was no ingredient label and as I have diet limitations I wasn't really sure what it contained other than ground mustard seed.

Unlike mustard pastes or packets, powder retains its freshness longer and will not spoil readily.  It is easily incorporated into dishes as a seasoning or made into a paste as an egg-roll condiment.  If you like fresh tasting hot mustard, this is the product for you.

review/summary: Like C4 explosive if not treated with respect!
review/text: You know what "normal" yellow mustard tastes like. S&B hot mustard ain't that. This is a dry powder you mix with water and allow to sit a minute or two to develop the full flavor.<br />And by flavor I mean an all out assault on your nasal passages (especially if you try too much!). It's kinda like English mustard but even more intense. (I am sure this mustard will play a lead role in "The Expendables 3").<br />Anyway this mustard smells/tastes similar to the little packets of hot mustard you get at Chinese restaurants but with much more WAHOO!<br />If you haven't been scared off yet I recommend trying it. If you do find it is too hot you need to either go back to the temple and retrain OR you could try diluting it with ketchup, soy sauce, or even your own tears.<br />The little tin should last a long time since you don't need a whole lot (I would say following the instructions on the tin will make too much).<br />I hope you find this review useful!

review/summary: Nice and Hot
review/text: I used to live in Florida and would get hot mustard from a Chinese place that would make my eyes water and really open up my sinuses.  Since I moved 5 years ago I have been looking for something similar, and finally I have found it.  This is a nice 3 ounce jar of powder that must be mixed with water.  I mix 1 teaspoon of powder with 1.5 teaspoons of water, and then let it sit for 5 minutes or so.  It has a good consistency and that wonderful hot flavor that you get from Chinese mustard.  This heat level blows away any pre-mixed stuff in a jar that you can get at a grocery store.  Since you can mix how much or little you need, this jar can last a really long time. Highly recommended.

review/text: There is no jerk seasoning better than Walkerswood, and few that even come close.  The flavor of the liquid stuff you find in many super markets bears little if any resemblance to what you taste when you visit Jamaica.  The only commercial mix I've found that even comes close to Walkerswood is Jamaican Choice, and that is still not up to par, having less bite and an undertone of sweetness.<br /><br />Rub your meat, poultry, or fish with oil, then apply the Walkerswood Jerk Seasoning to taste, massaging it in.  Let it stand for a while, then bake, broil, or (best of all) grill.  A little bit goes a long way, especially for "beginners" -- unless you are accustomed to spicy food, one teaspoonful will be enough for a thick pork chop.  Don't worry, though.  With Walkerswood, the heat does not overwhelm the complex flavor of the other spices.

review/text: Bust out the napkins, grab yourself a beer, and buckle your seat belts cause this stuff is a proper authentic flamefest of Jamaican jerk heat. You can put it on straight, or cut it with a little olive oil, but I've found it best to marinate chicken or pork tenderloins for at least 24 hours before cooking for optimum results. Its a little messy cause you really have to rub this stuff in and make sure you turn/shake your marinade bag every few hour to ensure an even distribution of this wondermous stuff. If you're not using rubber gloves, make sure you wash your hands and I wouldnt plan on rubbing your eyes or doing anything else to sensitive body parts for a while. haw haw<br /><br />This stuff is the best, followed closely by Grace Jerk Seasoning but Walkerswood doesn't turn your chicken green like the Grace rub does. 5 Pods

review/summary: Great bunny snacks but go with the variety packs
review/text: My wife and I are vegetarian so we don't eat anything that has gelatin in it (i.e., most gummy products).  I'm fine with that but my wife struggles because she loves gummy bears.  We've tried vegan gummy products, but they usually taste like cough syrup.  The Annie's fruit snacks are the exception.  They taste great, even better than other gummy products.  The only downside to this specific product is that there is only one flavor, strawberry.  I'd recommend the Berry Patch or Sunny Citrus versions because there is more variety.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QTWTA2/ref=oss_product<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PICX42/ref=oss_product

review/summary: Our family loves these organic gummy snacks. Delicious real fruit tastes.
review/text: Everyone in my family loves these delicious real food gummies. Annies has went above and beyond with the creation of this delicious flavor. My grandkids ages 1 to 5 and my kids 9 and 12 ask for these constantly. They love them so much, that I have to get me a pack when I first open a box ,or I will not get any. All the Annie gummy bunies flavors are awesome.

review/summary: Last batch Amazon sent arrived with gummies melted & way too soft
review/text: We've done a previous bulk order of these Annie's Organic Bunny Fruit before, and were very pleased that we were able to purchase them for below MSRP and what Target sells them for. However, this latest batch in the Strawberry and Mixed Berry flavors arrived with the gummies melted, making them way too soft (they stuck to our teeth and to each other.) Definitely going to cancel our subscription since the gummies did not taste good or fresh like they were the first time we ordered them.

review/summary: Great Fruit Snacks!
review/text: I absolutely love these, healthy and yummy with an awesome texture. This flavor variety is by far my favorite of all the Annie's Bunny Gummies. Texture is really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture. They aren't hard and you don't have to sit there chewing forever; but if you want you can suck not them and they won't just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth. They are perfect! I recommend trying the berry patch flavor as well!!<br /><br />Another great fruit snack to try if you like this texture is Ocean Spray brand. They are not organic, but they are less than half the price of these. Mott's Medley's all natural fruit snacks are yummy as well and are made with both fruit and vegetable juices! The Mott's ones are also not organic, and not quite as soft as the Ocean Spray or Annie's, but again, much less expensive.

review/summary: Why use can sugar when you don't need to?
review/text: These are extremely yummy fruit snacks! I am always on a quest to find organic, easy, yummy foods for our busy family. I was excited to find these and quickly bought a box, I've been impressed with all the Annie's products I have bought. They didn't disappoint in the taste department, but.... I am a little disappointed about the ingredients in these.<br /><br />Ingredient #1: Organic Tapioca Syrup-this appears to be a great alternative to high fructose corn syrup and other sugary additives. Here's what I pulled up about this ingredient-" Tapioca syrup provides the sweetness needed in a natural way. Produced from tapioca starch using a natural fermentation process, tapioca syrup is a gluten-free and non-GMO (genetically modified organism) alternative to corn syrup, sugar, honey, maple syrup and molasses."  [...]<br /><br />Ingredient #2: Organic cane sugar-this is just sugar. It's organic, so it wasn't grown using pesticides or anything, but sugar is sugar and I try to limit it as much as possible. I'm bummed that this is the 2nd ingredient.<br /><br />The rest of the ingredients aren't really a big deal to me, but here they are: Organic Tapioca Syrup Solids, Organic White Grape Juice Concentrate, Pectin, Citric Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Color (Black Carrot Juice Concentrate), Natural Flavors, Sodium Citrate, Organic Sunflower Oil, Carnauba Wax (From Palm Leaves).<br /><br />So why am I let down by this product? There are tons of great tasting fruit snacks out there that don't use any extra sugar to sweeten them. Stretch Island Origional Fruit Leathers don't use any extra sugars, here's the ingredients of their summer strawberry fruit leather- "Apple Puree Concentrate, Pear Puree Concentrate, Strawberry Puree, Organic Natural Strawberry Flavor, Lemon Juice Concentrate. All Sugars Are Found Naturally In The Fruit." Clif sells their Twisted Fruit rope that has no added sugar. Archer Farms sells a fruit snack for a great price that has no added sugar.<br /><br />So the Annie's Organic Fruit snacks are a great tasting snack that is far above those icky artificial brands that are loaded with artificial dye's and sugar, but I still think there's some room for improvement by using only fruit to sweeten it, rather than cane sugar.

review/summary: By far the tastiest fruit snack!
review/text: I didn't think an organic fruit snack would taste as fruity and interesting as the "worse for you" fruit snacks.  Usually, 'all natural' fruit snacks taste bland and old.  These are FABULOUS and addictive.  Plus, they're only 70 calories a pouch and all organic.  They're for all ages - believe me ;)  Great chewy texture, pretty colors, adorable bunny shapes, bright strawberry flavor.<br /><br />Shipping was fast and reliable, and the 4 box deal is nice.  New favorite candy.

review/summary: Strawberry, strawberry...
review/text: Annie's products are all tasty with natural ingredients.  While the strawberry variety is good, I think I'll stick to tropical flavor (or switch off)--thus strawberry gets 4-stars.  Truly, it's all a matter of ones' taste buds.  The strawberry really doesn't taste like strawberry at all--I wish she'd make an intense pack of "reds"....strawberry, raspberry and cherry.  I notice more distinction of flavors with her tropical blend..although even then it's very subtle.  I am an adult who purchases these for ME, though, so go figure!  As far as kids liking them?  I'm sure they would love the strawberry, and the tropical, and all of her flavors!  Kids just like sweet period.  The texture is what I like best...it's chewy and firm enough, without getting stuck in your teeth!

review/summary: Excellent Flavor, Excellent Healthy Alternative
review/text: I purchase these Annie's Fruit Snacks through the Subscribe & Save option and couldn't be happier.  For the per unit price, this is a great deal when comparing with local store prices.  This is a package deal of 4 boxes, each containing 5 pouches (.8 oz each).  These are all the same flavor (Summer Strawberry).<br /><br />I know some people may compare these with the mainstream fruit snacks that you can purchase in any grocery store and be reluctant at the smaller "quantity" contained in each pouch.  The idea here is that the quality of the product, nutritionally at least, far outweighs any size issues.  This is a problem with American societies misconception that more is better.  Like 'Super-sizing' your fast food value meal, portion sizes have been getting larger and larger over the years and people are now expecting to receive the most bang for their buck, regardless of its lacking nutritional value.  These .8 oz pouches are a perfectly decent portion size for a growing child, a diabetic with low blood sugar, or anyone that wishes for a small taste of something sweet and natural.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product, although some people may wish to try the assorted flavors rather than limit themselves to one flavor (as I prefer).

review/text: I'm not someone who shops specifically for organic food, given its higher price point. However, I am quite fond of these little fruit snacks and am glad they are preservative-free and dye-free. With the S&S price, they are signficantly cheaper than at my local Stop & Shop. I like to keep a couple in my lunch pail at work and in my car for when hunger strikes. The flavor is really intense.

review/text: I have had other Annie's fruit snacks and they are wonderful! But for some reason this mix is nasty. Very weird taste at first. Then gets a little bit better. My 4-year-old and her little friends ate them fine but I don't see why. Maybe it was a bad batch or something. Glad I got a good deal on them...would have been irritated if I would have paid a lot. But I do like that these are SO much better for you than others. As far as they consistency...they were just really gummy (I have never had that happen with other Annie's fruit snacks).

review/text: there's always something different about organic snacks. You can tell there is a difference in just the way they taste as well as how you feel after eating organic. These snacks have a nice texture to the gummy-they're not rubbery and chewy like most gummy snacks. And they don't leave a nasty after taste like a lot of foods that contain chemicals and other who knows what ingredients. I've also found that Wal-Mart is selling these snacks as well other fine organic foods, FYI.

My son loves the strawberry flavor (they all are good). The best thing is I don't have to worry about his ears gettin all red and cheeks turning bright red in reaction to the food coloring.

review/summary: Know What You're Drinking and Use with CAUTION
review/text: Celsius drinks claim to be "negative-caloric", which is to say that you actually burn calories by drinking it.  Hmmm. . . Sound too good to be true?  Well, of course it is.  It's low-calorie because it's made with Sucralose (Splenda to the average consumer) and it promotes weight loss because its a combination stimulant (taurine) and diuretic - so basically, it works on your body like any over-the-counter diet pill.  That said, the Raspberry Acai flavor does taste pretty good, but it will be up to the individual to decide whether or not any potential benefit justifies the downside.<br /><br />Unlike many other reviewers, I actually liked the taste - I thought that it was a smooth blend of green tea and berry flavor.  However, there is just enough of that artificial tang at the end to tip you off that it's sweetened with Splenda.  But the absence of any fizz or overly harsh flavors made it easy to drink - which is good because it comes in full-size cans and leaves you feeling pretty full (i.e. just shy of bloated) afterward.<br /><br />So is it any energy drink or a diet aid?  It's a little of both.  Most of the crucial ingredients are lumped together into a single line item (i.e. their secret, proprietary mix), but taurine is listed and the caffeine content is obvious.  I found that while Celsius could beat back an afternoon energy swoon, it didn't really make me any more alert or focused - just instantly awake, albeit in semi-zombie form.  This effect came on quickly and did last for a couple of hours at least.<br /><br />Now for the bad news - the "crash" effect that a lot of these drinks try to pin on their competitors was overwhelming with Celsius.  As a little bit of background, I'm a grown adult in good health and am very caffeine-tolerant.  However, during my testing of this product, I made the mistake of drinking two cans about three hours apart and ended up unable avoid my first all-nighter since college.  I was completely awake and pretty functional throughout, although I wouldn't have operated any heavy machinery at the time.  But by the morning, I was suffering headaches, muscle twitches and even a flutter in my chest.  I'm completely sure that this was all temporary side effects of the outrageous amount of stimulants and not permanently harmful, but it was still enough to make me wary from that point on.<br /><br />So, the bottom line is this - if you're looking to occasionally avoid getting sleepy mid-afternoon at the office, or if you need to stay up late once in a while, Celsius may be an option for you to try.  As a prolonged weight-loss regimen, I wouldn't take on the potential health risks in order to grab at some too-good-to-be-true advertising come-on.  There's still only one way to lost weight and keep it off, and it ain't fun and it ain't quick, but it works:  eat better, eat less and exercise more!

review/summary: A Beverage That Burns Calories? Is it Too Good to be True?
review/text: Celsius Raspberry Acai Green Tea beverage is a decent- flavored beverage loaded with nutrition, with minimal calories, low sodium, and none of the bad qualities that make so many other beverages so unappealing. Oh, and one other thing: The manufacturer claims that consuming this beverage will help you burn extra calories. This product is decent in flavor, with the light taste of green tea backed with a small amount of raspberry and some medicinal properties. It is non- cabonated, smooth, and as easy to consume as a glass of water.<br /><br />The key difference between this and your average green tea beverage is the calorie- burning claim. The manufacturer claims that this beverage helps you burn about one- hundred calories per can and when you consider that there are only about ten calories in each serving, it would therefore mean that consuming this beverage will actually result in negative calories. This almost sounds too good to be true, but a quick examination of the ingredients makes it easier to understand why this is possible. This product contains added stimulants in the form of caffeine and taurine. These stimulants will give your metabolism a boost, and this extra metabolism will likely lead to added caloric loss. The manufacturer is cautious when it makes this claim, pointing out that results are best when combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise. I can see how this drink could contribute to some extra caloric expenditure, due to the added boost of energy, but like the manufacturer claims, it takes more than ingesting stimulants to lose weight. You still need to control your eating habits and exercise for maximum effect.<br /><br />The added stimulants could discourage some people from trying this beverage, but another potential turn- off is the price. Purchasing a couple of cases of this product would be almost as expensive as buying an inexpensive piece of exercise equipment. Unless I was seriously into losing weight and wanted any little bit of help I could get, I am not so sure this product would be worth the money.<br /><br />Still, when all things are considered, Celsius Raspberry Acai Green Tea is a good beverage that is worth trying. The nutrition is much better than that found in most beverages and the taste, while it does have an artificial sweetener finish, is pleasant nonetheless. I'm a little cautious about consuming anything that contains multiple stimulants and increases my heart rate, but this is still a good product; better than the vast majority of beverages on the market and certainly worth trying if you're looking for a liquid fitness companion.

review/summary: Relatively healthy caffeine delivery system
review/text: If someone tells you they drink this because they like the taste, they may not be telling the truth. I shared these with quite a few people, and the taste was never one of the good things people said about it. That doesn't mean that there aren't any good things about it, though.<br /><br />It contains some vitamins and minerals. A test at a university found that volunteers saw some improvements in body composition. It claims to burn 100 calories per can, and who can say it doesn't?<br /><br />It assures us that it works best (in its claims to increase muscle and lessen fat) with diet and exercise, and I'm sure that's true. None of the guinea pigs in my house noticed any effects, positive or negative, though we drank it before exercise as instructed.<br /><br />Here's what it does for sure: it gives you a kick of caffeine. If you prefer a sweet, cold drink to coffee or tea, then this is probably better for you than colas. If you start or end your day with a doughnut and coffee to get the caffeine/sweets combo, then this could be a more wholesome choice. And if you believe in it enough, it could encourage you to work out harder or longer, because faith can do wonders, and there are benefits to increasing exercise.

So in order for this product to help you lose one pound you must not eat or drink anything else for 35 days or you would have to take in the exact same amount of calories everyday with one of these drinks.<br /><br />It is ment to ASSIST you in losing weight while doing a healthy diet and exercise program, NOT make you lose weight.<br /><br />I personally love the product, I found it helped me get through a good 1-2 hours of exercise easier and it makes my work days go by smoother.

review/summary: Good tasting but nothing special
review/text: Hydration is a very big deal to me now as is staying awake. I had no experience with these energy drinks - this was my first one. I did not have an issue with the taste like some other reviewers have stated. There is that after glow of artificial sweetener. Altogether, that is outdone by the berry/green tea flavor. It was pleasant to drink with a glass full of ice. Refreshing. No carbonation so you can sip on it as long as you like.<br /><br />As for the other effects from the caffeine and caffeine-like additives (like taurine), I never got it. I do drink coffee and soda on a daily basis. A huge cup of coffee has a definite effect whereas this just gave me a little tiny bump. I found myself reading and re-reading the contents, trying to figure out what was going on, or not going on.<br /><br />If you are a person who avoids coffee or other stimulants, this may do it for you. I'm thinking that the additives (which all source out as healthy) would be what attracts you and the taste is what would keep you. The middle part about losing weight or giving yourself a late afternoon buzz I can not attest to. The price is reasonable for energy drinks in this category. These are easily $2 a piece at the corner grocery. Buying them in bulk with subscribe and safe gives you a good bit of savings.<br /><br />Weaning yourself off coffee and taking up Celsius is a strategic bargain. I do believe that bump is there, although I did not experience it. The other stuff makes it a wiser choice than roasted beans run through hot water, although roasted beans sure are fine :)

Maybe it just wasn't for my taste buds.<br /><br />At the end of the day about 90% of the people that tried it didn't much care for it, for a variety of reasons.<br /><br />Some didn't like the taste and prefered regular green tea.<br />Some experienced a 'crash' effect after drinking it<br />Some had doubts about all the health claims surrounding it<br /><br />I think those were the main three complaints with this drink. As I said before I was not impressed in the least. Maybe for someone out there this is the right product for him, but there seems to be so many other (better) options out there.<br /><br />This one just wasn't for me.

review/summary: Effective Energy Drink, But The Cola Flavor Is Better!
review/text: Celsius Calorie Burner Green Tea Raspberry is every bit (or more so) as energizing as any of the other energy drinks (Monster, AMP, etc), but it has a bitter aftertaste. We tried this after trying the very good <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00153B3KW">Celsius Calorie Burner, Cola, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, but we were sadly disappointed by this flavor.<br /><br />While I can't really confirm that this actually burns 100 Calories just by drinking a whole can, it certainly would not surprise me since this does pack a serious kick. I drink a can of Celsius about a half hour before my workouts and it does seem to give me more energy throughout the whole hour and half or so. On occasions where I don't have time to grab a cup of my morning coffee, one of these does the job of waking me up just fine.<br /><br />A note of caution: I do have a high caffeine tolerance (cultivated through years of drinking "too much" coffee) so while this is fine for me, my teenage son tried one before his workout and got "jittery". Also, while not an issue about the drink, the can is made of very thin aluminum and is prone to ripping if you crush it, causing sharp edges that can (and did) cut fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is an effect energy drink but it isn't as good tasting as the Cola flavor (which I even put it on automatic reorder). The Orange flavor is also better tasting.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: While good tasting, leaves my tummy feeling sickly
review/text: This is a pretty good tasting tea in gernal. It is not too sweet and actually has a tea taste to it. I am not sure if it really helped me burn that much more calories in general but I do know that I can feel it working. I get hungry faster after drinking this. The only down side, which knocked it down a few stars for me, is that it leaves a sickly feeling in my stomach. It feels like my stomach is almost hollow and just very uncomfortable in general. Almost like a slow heartburn. Otherwise, this is a pretty good tasting tea.

The non-sugary taste and absence of carbonation, along with the lack of High Fructose Corn Syrup makes this a favorable choice!<br /><br />However, the sweetener used is disappointing (Stevia would be a healthier choice); and the use of Calcium Carbonate ("chalk") is no good for the body either.

review/summary: Burn Baby Burn!
review/text: Celsius is a reasonably tasty and healthy supplement drink. It claims to help the drinker burn up to 100 calories with each can by raising your metabolism for 3 hours in conjunction with excercise. I cannot vouch for that, but it seems plausible. Drinking a bottle certainly gives me a blast of energy. I become markedly more alert and energetic. Whereas sometimes I would drag at the beginning of jog, after drinking Celsius I'd be spry from the get-go. I would caution against drinking too much though. I had two cans in the space of 6 hours and I got very fluttery - almost dizzy. These cans pack some powerful stimulants, or maybe my tolerance for them is low. Anyhow, keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that Celsius is more effective if drunk 15 minutes before exercise. It might burn some extra calories if you're only sitting at a desk but I doubt you'd see any results. To lose it, you've got to move it! I consumed case of the stuff with and without exercising, and I can't say I've noticed much of a difference.<br /><br />As a drink, I found Celsius to be decent. Not the best thing I've ever tasted but not bad. The tea flavor is there, but the raspberry acai flavor predominates. Even that isn't overdone though. I wouldn't say it is watery but it is a lighter beverage than say pure fruit juice. One thing I didn't care for was the fact that it contains sucralose (Splenda). While I have not noticed any ill effects from consuming sucralose, others have. I'd rather not have artificially proceed sweeteners in my drinks if possible. That said, it doesn't effect the taste in a negative manner, as you can see from the photos of my co-worker in the user submitted images above.<br /><br />Celsius could be a good part of a diet/exercise program. It certainly is a stimulant. I felt it's effect more strongly than with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L9XK4">5 Hour Energy</a>, which I also like. At only 10 calories, it isn't going to hurt in any event. It's a little expensive but it is more than just a tea or soft drink so it that's understandable. If you don't mind consuming Splenda and can tolerate the stimulant ingredients, I would give it my qualified recommendation.

review/summary: Tasty and refreshing energy drink
review/text: A bit to my surprise, this turned out to be a very pleasant-tasting drink. In my experience sport drinks or energy drinks are either too overpowering in their taste, or have an unpleasant "medicine"-like aftertaste, especially if they are low in calories. This energy-burning drink has none of those characteristics. The taste of raspberry is very obvious, but not overpowering. The drink is not as heavy as a fruit juice though, and hence much more suitable as a light refreshment. The fact that it is not carbonated is also a plus, as it will not leave you feeling bloated. This is especially important if you are drinking it during or before a workout. I cannot ascertain how effective this drink is in terms of burning calories (they claim that one can burns up to 100 calories), but it sure did energize me and gave me an extra jolt. In that respect it is probably no better than any other caffeinated beverage. However, this drink is flavored with an artificial sweetener, which to me is not the best of an idea for a supplement that is designed to supposedly burn calories. Recent research has shown that artificial sweeteners actually have the opposite effect from the one that they are designed for - our bodies adjust to misinterpreting the sweetness to be associated with low calories, so we end up retaining more energy from "regularly" sweetened products.<br /><br />The shape of these cans is also convenient for storage or transport. I find it easier to put one of these in my bag than a regularly sized soda can.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed these drinks a lot, but I am a bit skeptical of their calorie-burning effects.

review/summary: SIMPLY AMAZING!
review/text: I am the biggest skeptic when it comes to fads and power drinks etc, but with a free trial I decided to give this stuff a go. I have been working out for a little over a year after a long break from an exercise program. I have been seeing very good results, but after a year of working out, I haven't been able to add to my workout in a while. I also wasn't losing any weight after losing 90 pounds in the first 6 months. Whenever I would do a longer workout I found that my legs would be tried the next day and I couldn't do a very good workout that day.<br /><br />This month I decided that I needed to step up my cardio from 35 minutes to 70 minutes. I had no problem doing this the first day,but I knew I would be tired for the the next day workout. My shipment of this drink came in and I tried a can in the morning after a light breakfast. My workout went surprisingly smooth with no fatigue what so ever. I have been drinking one in the morning for a week now and I love the results.<br /><br />I am someone who can't drink much coffee as it effects my stomach. I found that this drink doesn't effect my stomach at all. The taste is pretty good, but it's not something to flip over. I can't say if it is making me burn more calories either, but if I can double my workout, I know it is helping me a great deal. I also find that I have a lot more energy throughout the day. I only drink one a day before my workout and that's all I intend on drinking. I don't want this to become a crutch, but if it can help me to exercise more than I think it is worth it. I do not intend on drinking this stuff forever, but until I get used to the extra workout I think this is the best energy drink I've ever used.<br /><br />This drink is certainly not good for you, but sometimes something bad can be used to do some good. One can of this stuff has as much caffine as an entire six pack of Coke! I do not recomment you start drinking this stuff every day, but if it can get you motivatied to start a life goal then give it a try, just know your limitations with addiction and do not use it all the time.

review/summary: Tastes like cough syrup from 1979.
review/text: Remember that stuff your mom used to give you to stop your cough when you were a kid?  Well, this tastes VERY MUCH like that.  Ugh.  I am drinking this now trying to come up with adjectives to describe what I am tasting to you.... watery, non-carbonated, slightly-grape-ish, dry, and weird.  That best describes what this stuff tastes like.  I would never purchase this on my own.<br /><br />As for the claim on the can "burn up to 100 calories and more" - how does one prove that?  I certainly can't tell you if it will help me burn 100 calories.  There's no way for me to prove or disprove that statement.  By the same token - shouldn't we slap that on black coffee as well?  Certainly coffee ups your metabolism as well, right?<br /><br />The can is really trying to sell itself; "NO Sugar" "No Aspartame" "NO Artificial Colors or Flavors".  Yah but that doesn't mean it TASTES any good.  It's really like a light watered version of old corn syrup.<br /><br />I would drink this over a period of a week or so to see if there is any difference in my weight, but wow, I can't - I can't get past that flavor...

review/summary: Great Energy Kick, but Weight Loss? Not So Much...
review/text: I waited to review these until I had used the entire case so I could accurately report their effect. First of all I like the way they taste. They are very similar to all the diet green teas on the market and didn't have a chemical taste, like some energy drinks do. Compared to Red Bull, these are a taste treat! I got a great energy boost from these, but invariably I also crashed about 5 hours later. As for weight loss, I weighed the day I had my first drink and I weighed on the last day. I made absolutely zero changes to my diet or lifestyle and, not surprisingly, I didn't lose a pound. I weigh exactly the same as I did before. So, as far as weight loss goes, this is probably not a good choice. However if you are looking for a tasty, quick energy boost, these are great. Just be aware that the crash WILL come in a few hours!

review/summary: Probably won't notice 100 calories, okay as an energy boost
review/text: The main draw of this product is the claim it helps burn up to 100 calories per drink, but will anyone really notice 100 calories? I know I wouldn't. So don't let yourself get drawn in too quickly on purchasing this product based on that fact alone. I certainly noticed no difference in my body shape with "extra" calories burned during the time I drank these once a day.<br /><br />My initial impression of the drink (raspberry acai) was it had a slightly herbal-medicinal aftertaste to it. The first can I had, I noticed a very slight energy boost after drinking, but all drinks afterwards, I noticed no difference - but then, I'm the kind that caffeine doesn't have much of a noticeable effect on anymore. Perhaps this will work as an energy drink for most people, but it was nothing besides a fizzy drink in a can that tasted slightly off for me.

review/summary: Competent Energy Drink
review/text: I tried out Celsius Raspberry Acai for about a month, a can a day.  Not sure if it helped me lose any weight, my pants are actually a bit tighter than a month ago but that might be from all the Easter candy.<br /><br />Typically I have an energy drink a few times a week, usually Diet Red Bull.  I found the Celsius to be a competent replacement for my energy drink fix.  It has a decent amount of caffeine to inspire me to get out of bed and go to work.  The taste is decent though not overly impressive, hints of fruit but slight sugar-free aftertaste (and when I put it in a wine glass and swirled it around I found it had good legs and a pleasant aroma).  It did not have enough carbonation for my tastes...I like a bit of a carb bite along the lines of Red Bull.  My wife actually likes the taste more than I do.<br /><br />Overall, a good energy drink that does the job.  Tastes decent, low calorie.

review/summary: MAGIC THIN JUICE?
review/text: Well, it's not magic thin juice. It specifically says, on the packaging, that just drinking Celsius will not cause weight loss. It only works when you combine it with diet and/or exercise. It says it helps you burn 100 calories per can...that's not really a whole lot. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JE8V2">3 Musketeers Candy Bar</a>s I shouldn't be eating have 270.<br /><br />I decided to substitute these for my morning latte. They have enough caffeine in them to give me my morning boost, but that's about it. Over the two week period, I didn't notice any great increase in energy, and it certainly didn't improve my metabolism enough to see any weight loss. The taste is acceptable, it's actually better than I thought it would be. I do find that I have trouble finishing the can before it gets warm, but I've always been a slow drinker.<br /><br />I may try using these as a mixer for adult beverages; it would save me at least 100 calories a drink if I stopped using apple pucker and sweet and sour...

review/summary: Green Tea With A Raspberry Acai Kick
review/text: Let's face it.  There are a lot of so-called "energy" drinks and "calorie-burning" fluids on the market that make multiple promises to their would-be consumers.  Most of these drinks claim to increase your energy, sharpen your alertness, and speed up your metabolism in order to help you get through the work day or enhance your work out routine.  Most of these drinks also come packed with enough sugar and caffeine to kill a bull.<br /><br />Celsius has thrown their hat into the energy drink ring with their Raspberry Acai/Green Tea concoction.  I find it to be a hit-and-miss combination when compared to the competition.<br /><br />Much like the other energy drinks out there, it claims to increase your metabolism (over a three hour period in this case) and sustain your energy to keep you alert.  Unlike most other energy drinks, it features no sugar, aspartame, preservatives, high fructose corn syrup or artificial colors or flavors.  It isn't carbonated, either.  It's also packed with only ten calories per serving instead of one hundred plus like many other energy drinks.<br /><br />The taste of the Raspberry Acai Green Tea is very pleasant when compared to other energy drinks, but is a bit bitter.  I sort of expect this thanks to the raspberry flavor, but it is still much nicer than other energy drinks in the taste department.  I've found that almost all energy drinks (with the exception of Monster's coffee-based drinks) have a medicinal taste to them that doesn't enhance my drinking experience.  In other words, I feel like the taste of these drinks is something I have to deal with in order to get the key benefits of each drink.  Celsius is actually refreshing, and doesn't make me feel bloated after drinking it.<br /><br />Celsius doesn't make me jittery like many other energy drinks do.  I also don't notice much of a change in my energy levels after drinking Celsius either.  While that isn't necessarily a bad thing, I do expect to feel some sort of boost when drinking an energy drink.  With Celsius, I don't get that.<br /><br />As many others have already stated, Celsius claims to burn up to one hundred calories per serving.  I have no way of checking this claim out, so I'll just have to take their word for it.  The words "up to" give them a lot of breathing room, so that does make me wonder just how many calories the average person will actually burn by drinking this beverage.<br /><br />Celsius has a very good product on their hands with their Raspberry Acai Green Tea.  It beats the competition in taste, ingredients (good and bad), and as a refreshing drink.  It appears to be lacking, however, in the energy-boosting department.<br /><br />Overall, if you are already using some sort of physical exercise to keep yourself in shape, I see no problem with adding Celsius to that routine as a decent replacement for other energy drinks.  If you're just thirsty after cutting the lawn, Celsius has the rest of the gang beaten hands down.

review/summary: Over Hyped Ice Tea
review/text: First of all, let me say that I do not fit the demographic to whom Celsius is hyped...the twenty-something super jock extreme sports person. I am full-figured, approaching geezerdom, and disabled. I have also seen lots of products come and go making wild claims of various miracles. With that in mind, I approached this product a bit more critically.<br /><br />This product reminds me of the old Wendy's commercial, "Where's the Beef?" Lots of "sizzle" not much "steak." From reading some of the other reviews, it seems some believe the acai berry benefits hype, but read on.<br /><br />First, they say, "Perfect blended flavor of fresh-picked raspberries and acai berries." Great! I love raspberries, and acai is supposed to be the latest wonder anti-oxidant. OOPS! "Flavor" is the operative word here. There are no raspberries nor acai in this beverage, only "natural flavors." To boldly hype acai, implying the benefits of it, but only to containing "natural flavors" is worth deducting 1 star.<br /><br />"Burns up to 100 calories and more per can." First, there's the disclaimer "up to." More than what? How does it burn calories? Taken as part of a diet and exercise program. Exercise! Well there's a new one. I guess the 200 mg of caffeine would give you an extra boost to allow you to work out longer, but I haven't verified that personally.<br /><br />Yes, Celsius cites six studies "proving" it works, but on closer examination, five of the six were done by the same person at the University of Oklahoma, and all were funded by Celsius. All were done using carefully screened college students in their early 20's. I don't automatically discount such studies, and they may be valid, but other independent studies would lend more credibility to their claims.<br /><br />OK, all that aside, how does it taste? One of first things I noticed was the artificial sweetener taste...and aftertaste. Sure enough, it contains sucralose, aka Splenda. The flavor is ok, if you like flavored ice tea. Green tea has such a mild flavor other flavors should dominate. They say, "We love ginger and hope you do too!  Each Celsius is delicately balanced with a touch of spicy ginger plus all the great health benefits." While others have discerned a ginger flavor, I don't. Acai? Not sure what it tastes like, but only the raspberry really comes though...along with the aforementioned aftertraste.<br /><br />There is definitely a caffeine "boost."<br /><br />Overall, there's not enough for me to like in this product for me to purchase it. My wife and others I have shared this with are similarly underwhelmed. Regular, unflavored, ice tea will continue to be my iced tea of choice. For a caffeine boost, coffee will do.

review/summary: Sustained energy boost, best flavor I've found
review/text: I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program. I started drinking one 12 ounce can of Celsius 15 minutes prior to weight and cardio workouts (I do 3-4x's a week for approximately 1.5 hours each time), and have found Celsius brand to be far superior to Monster in the energy boost it gives me.<br /><br />Each 12 ounce can has 200mg of caffeine (check out the Celsius website...) so I don't drink any coffee on the mornings I'm off to the gym as when I do drink both, I tend to get jittery instead of 'boosted'. I also eat a small breakfast which includes complex carbohydrates and protein prior to drinking Celsius.  I do not get any stomach upset, although I'm prone to it when taking vitamins and supplements, and I enjoy the Raspberry Acai taste.  Not too sweet, not too tart... very pleasant with no aftertaste.<br /><br />Celsius' calorie burning claims come from the thermogenesis angle. Meaning it will keep your metabolism fired up for a longer period of time (up to 3 hours post-workout) and thus you can potentially burn up to 100 extra calories. It has ginger, chromium and green tea - all favored for their 'fat burning' properties, along with high vitamin C and B vitamins. No sugar, no carbs, no preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup, no trans fats and very low sodium (6mg) make this a good energy drink choice in my book.<br /><br />One thing to note when using this supplement, is that it may act as a diuretic - it does for me, thus I have to urinate a lot for several hours after drinking just one 12 ounce can.<br /><br />Another thing to remember is the amount of caffeine is very high in this drink.  They say on the website that you can drink up to 3 a day (that's 600mg of caffeine a day...), but with one, I feel jazzed for hours.  Celsius makers do not recommend this drink to anyone who is 12 or under, or caffeine intolerant.<br /><br />Check out their website for studies relating to fat loss and this product.  They do say that as part of a diet AND exercise program the Celsius drinks CAN help you burn more fat.  I will keep drinking this product (not changing anything else in my diet/exercise/supplement routing in the meantime) 3-4 x's per week, pre-workout and post an update to this review at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.  I will be tracking my body fat percentages to see if Celsius is really a fat burner or simply a metabolic booster for calorie burning.<br /><br />UPDATE: May 1, 2010<br />After using this product before EVERY workout for the past month these are my conclusions.<br />1. - This flavor is still my favorite, but I prefer it cold.  At room temp I can taste more bitterness than I like.<br />2.- When I drink Celsius 15 minutes before exercising I notice a definite, sustained energy boost for my workouts, but I also eat a small breakfast prior to drinking it - have not tried it on an empty stomach.<br />3. - No jitters drinking 1 can per day, prior to workout.<br />4. - Bodyfat percentages have dropped.  I'm not convinced this is due to Celsius, but rather the elevated intensity and duration of my workouts, which 'may' be due to the boost given to me by Celsius.  So not a direct link, but a link.<br /><br />Overall, I like Celsius products and will continue to use them pre-workout as a calorie-free, energy boost.

review/summary: GOOD TASTING.... WITH A KICK
review/text: I have tried Celsius Raspberry Acai as well as Peach Mango.  I prefer the Raspberry Acai but both taste good.<br /><br />Celsius is not a health food drink.  It is made from green tea, and is not overloaded with sugar or artificial ingredients, but it does contain 200 mg. of caffeine.  For a 12 ounce can, that's a good deal of caffeine, about twice of an average coffee.<br /><br />Aside from that, it tastes good.  It has a mild taste, typical of a green tea, not particularly sweet and not really bitter.  I would say it tastes far better than Red Bull.  I always find Red Bull to taste like cold Robitussin.<br /><br />Celsius also contains ginger and taurine, although I didn't notice any taste of ginger, which is a good thing to me.<br /><br />I cannot say what, if any, effect it has on your metabolism, although between the green tea, acai, and caffeine, it probably perks it up a little.<br /><br />All in all, a pleasant tasting drink.  I would continue drinking it, if nothing else for the low caloric intake, just 10 calories for a 12 ounce can.

review/summary: Fancy name for Green Tea - I lost 10 lbs. just looking at the label!
review/text: I was watching a TV special on Acai saving a country's (Columbia?) economy as a new miracle antioxidant crop the night before I received these.  So,  I looked for the Acai content, doesn't seem to be in the ingredients, must just be Acai flavored.  Raspberry?  None of that either, unless that's one of the 'natural flavors.'<br /><br />BURN UP TO 100 CALORIES AND MORE IN EACH CAN!  Lofty statement.  Is it burn up to 100,  or burn up to more?  Wouldn't that be 100 or more? In each can.  The calories are in the can?<br /><br />Fine Print: As part of your exercise.  Knew there was a catch, otherwise I would have bought a truckload.<br /><br />Where is this stuff made?  Only says bottled for Celsius, not where.  Gotta be careful these days, what with melamine and lead ending up everywhere.<br /><br />But, it tastes good.  Contains caffeine, ginger and taurine like every good energy drink should.<br /><br />So, it's OK, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it.  As a matter of fact I might avoid it just because of all of the marketing nonsense spread all over the label.  Celsius, please treat me like an adult.

review/summary: Has a definite aftertaste
review/text: As a drink it is only okay.  Each 12 oz. can contains 10 calories and 200mg of caffeine (about the same as 2 cups of coffee, or 4 cans of diet coke).  It works to wake you up, and gives a bit of an energy boost when you're dragging.  It is made from green tea and acai berry.  Both can take a bit raspy for lack of a better word.  It is not really bitterness, but has a definite aftertaste.  Although the raspberry adds quite bit of sweetness, it doesn't get rid of the funky harshness of the green tea and acai.<br /><br />As a regular drink, I would pass.  As an "energy drink," it tastes better than some others I have had.  I can't say whether it helps you lose weight, but I have noticed that I get hungry earlier than usual.

review/summary: Delicious, but expensive drink
review/text: The flavor of this drink is really very good - and I love that it is not carbonated.  After the first sip, I savored the tang of Ginger & raspberry mixing together.  A few of my friends compared it favorably to Red Bull - and even mentioned how they thought this drink would mix well with Vodka (something I personally wouldn't do).<br />Each can packs 200mg of caffeine - so this should be avoided well before sleep time.

review/summary: Tastes Okay
review/text: I am a big fan of Green Tea so naturally I was excited to try this Acai, Green Tea beverage from Celsius. After drinking most of the cans I don't really feel that I can recommend this drink for its intended purpose.<br /><br />Green tea does boost your metabolism and has some caffeine which boosts your energy. This drink obviously is intended to capitalize on the weight loss benefits from green tea. However, I did not find that it tasted good. You don't want to gag when you drink it but its not a great tasting beverage. I think I might like it without the somewhat fake tasting raspberry flavor.<br /><br />This drink is not cheap and I doubt you will lose much weight if you consume this beverage on a regular basis. There are much more effective ways to get the health advantages of Green tea. Iced green tea is delicious with lemon and won't cost you this much money.

review/summary: Delicious! But don't drink before bed :-)
review/text: What's the product? Celsius Green Tea Raspberry Acai (not to be confused with the new Berry Acai flavour from Absolut Vodka, which is equally delicious).<br /><br />What's it all about? It's supposed to help you burn up to 100 calories more than you normally would with just diet and exercise alone! This is always a tough thing to measure because with diet and exercise you're going to burn calories - but this product claims that it can help you burn MORE just by drinking it.<br /><br />How do they do it? Well it's probably because it's got caffeine in it! But it's got a lot more than that. Aside from vitamins like C, B6, B12, it's also got riboflavin, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid (which just sounds cool to say), calcium, and chromium. But it doesn't stop there. Add in a proprietary blend of taurine, guarana, green tea, caffeine, glucosomethingorother, and ginger extract and you've got a drink that really packs a punch!<br /><br />How does it taste? Actually it tastes great! You can definitely get notes of the green tea and ginger (so if you love ginger tea you're going to find affinity here too), but the flavours are all light. They don't overpower each other, and they don't make for a drink that you're going to want to water down. Seriously I can see this becoming the next Red Bull type product - mixed with the aforementioned vodka perhaps?<br /><br />Delicious - absolutely. Energizing - absolutely. So much so that I had one of these at about 8pm and was up until 2am full of energy. So depending upon your lifestyle needs, you could drink these about any time during the day and feel great. Enjoy it!

review/summary: Wow!-That's-A-Lot-Of-Caffeine!
review/text: The makers of this product claim, and I quote: "Celsius�, comes in a variety of delicious flavors and delivery systems. All Celsius products are powered by the calorie burning benefits of MetaPlus(tm), a proprietary blend of scientifically validated ingredients shown to burn 100 calories on average, by boosting your metabolism and providing a sustained energy boost. Celsius is a healthier alternative for sodas, energy drinks, sugar loaded coffee and juices."<br /><br />Well, I honestly can't address the calorie-burning claims, but I can tell you that the active ingredient in this drink is caffeine.  LOTS and LOTS of caffeine.  As in 200 mg per serving.  That's the same amount you'd get from drinking two-and-a-half 8.2 oz cans of Red Bull ... or about three 12 oz cans of Jolt cola!<br /><br />So is it really a "healthier alternative"? Well, that's debatable.  As I type this review, my mind is buzzing, my legs are jittery and my hands are shaking, so I think in my case I'm better off sticking with my normal drinks ... diet, caffeine-free sodas and teas, Gatorade and Powerade, tomato juice, and filtered tap water.  Depending on factors like your age, body weight and metabolism, you might do just fine with this Celsius green tea concoction, but if you're anything like me, it's way too much.  And the raspberry taste, while okay, is not something I can't live without.  Bottom line:  Buyer Beware!

review/summary: Energy Drink or Diet Drink?
review/text: Okay, first of all this apears to be marketed as a diet aid.  As such it has green tea, ginger, acai, artificial sweetener (which I can't stand) and a handful of other ingredients that other people have listed quite nicely.  The theory that this claims is that with the caffiene, diuretics and taurine included, along with the 0 calories, that you will burn more calories then you intake.<br /><br />I'm a bit leery about this claim, though I can see how it would work "technically."  It Celsius also has a heavy dose of caffiene in it, which I'm not sure that people who are dieting really want to add into their diet.<br /><br />I tried one - I REALLY didn't like the flavor, I've never been a green tea fan but I thought I'd give it a whirl.  I won't be drinking any others because I just can't stomach it.<br /><br />My husband tried a few and took them to work with him to hand out to his construction workers.  My husband also didn't care for the taste at all.<br /><br />The construction crew - not one asked where to get it, or for a second can.  Sadly I have yet to find anyone who likes these enough to want to drink a second can.  Even my energy drink junkie friends didn't like this stuff.  I think most of them disliked the taste of the green tea combined with the artificial sweeteners.

review/summary: Watch Out.  This Stuff Has a Real Kick!
review/text: Green tea?  Raspberry?  Acai?<br /><br />Sounds innocuous, doesn't it?  Do not be deceived.  This little drink packs an unexpected wallup.  Lots of caffeine and sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose is the same thing as Splenda, and I avoid Splenda (and other artificial sweeteners). So, unfortunately, I won't be a Celsius fan until they switch to a natural sweetener.<br /><br />Which is really, really unfortunate because this is a really, really refreshing drink.  And, yes, I drank the entire can before reading the label.  A case of failing to take my own good advice:  "Read the label First!"<br /><br />Here's my take on Celsius.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1.  I am already fond of green tea, and this green tea drink is very tasty. I can easily imagine how good it would be on a hot summer's day in Texas.<br /><br />2.  I have no way of determining whether Celsius lives up to its promise to burn calories, but that's an intriguing thought.  Maybe . . . but its taste is so good that I'd drink it anyway (if it weren't for the sucralose and caffeine).<br /><br />3.  The Raspberry Acai formula has only ten calories.  Who could argue with that?<br /><br />Except for the sucralose.  Except for the caffeine.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. Fedex delivered my case of Celsius at 3 pm.  I opened my first can at 5 pm.  And chugged it right down.  And missed my normal good night's sleep.  Be aware that there's a boatload of caffeine in this product. And be a better consumer than I was -- read the label BEFORE you drink.<br /><br />My thoughts?  If you're going to drink this beverage, do so before noon.  Or prepare to stay awake for a looooooong time.<br /><br />2. I don't do sucralose. Whether you call it Splenda or something else, I'm not a fan of drinking chlorine-laced sugar, so that removes Celsius from my list of hot weather treats.  But if it should happen that they replace the sucralose with stevia (and tone down the caffeine), I'll reconsider my decision.<br /><br />Too bad, because Celsius Raspberry Acai is delish.<br /><br />So how do I rate it?<br /><br />Five stars for taste, one star for sucralose and way too much caffeine.  Three stars average.

review/summary: An alternative to a cup of coffee IF you like raspberry iced teas
review/text: I'll start with the disclaimer that I received this product for review and did not purchase it myself.  With that being said, this is a difficult product to review because there is a lot of highly subjective personal opinion that goes into a reviewing an item like this.<br /><br />Basically, if you enjoy bottled, flavored iced tea beverages, then you'll probably enjoy this.  If you already hate Arizona iced tea or Lipton's flavored teas, this Celsius Raspberry Acai beverage is going to be no different.<br /><br />The flavor is very much akin to Arizona or Lipton raspberry flavored iced teas.  This Celsius product is a green tea with raspberry acai.  It is not carbonated and is not sugar sweetened.  I find just like the other companies' raspberry iced teas, the Celsius Raspberry Acai flavor starts out cool and smooth, but finishes with a somewhat tart harshness.  Myself, I've never been a big fan of that unsweetened or lightly sweetened ice tea flavor that finishes with the harsh ending.  The Celsius Raspberry Acai is drinkable, but I don't find myself craving another can at any point.  However,  I can see where some people find it to be undrinkable, likely due to the finishing flavor.  Still, it's nothing you haven't tasted before if you've had those other products.<br /><br />So what's the big deal with this Celsius brand of canned teas versus any others?  Well, the can boasts that drinking a 12 oz serving (10 calories) boosts your metabolism to burn off 100 calories.  Obviously there is no way I can support or dispute this claim as I have no way to measure my resting metabolic rate after drinking this stuff.  What I can say, though, is that there is 200  mg of caffeine per can.  You can compare that to 12 oz of coffee which I think is usually somewhere around 120-150 mg of caffeine, depending on brand and type.  The last couple of days I've substituted my 11am cup of coffee with a Celsius can and I get the same level of pick-me-up as the coffee.  So, I can vouch for the added alertness and energy boost.  As far as burning 100 calories after drinking it? I honestly don't know.  That comes back to personal opinion and whether or not you believe all the acai diet hype with adding "meta-blends" of taurine and guarana and ginger extracts, etc.  I have to leave that up to you to decide as I'm not a nutritionist and have had little experience with similar products.<br /><br />Overall, I personally give it 3 stars because I find it to be drinkable (though I don't LOVE it) and it gives me a comparable lift as a cup of coffee, but I don't know if I personally believe all the energy burning claims.  If you enjoy other brands of iced, raspberry flavored teas and you're into the calorie burning claims of acai/herbal blends, then I would definitely recommend you try this stuff.  If you already know that you don't like green or raspberry flavored iced teas, you'll have a hard time swallowing a can of this.

review/summary: My Taste Buds Say NO MORE!
review/text: I was excited with the concept of being able to burn calories and boost my metabolism by consuming one can of a flavored drink.  After opening a can and taking one sip, the disappointment was written all over my face.  The taste is horrible.  I can not even force myself to drink one whole can.  I sipped it as long as I could and poured the rest down the drain.  The flavor is strange - I don't how else to put it.  It is bitter and has a bad after taste.  I could smell the Raspberry flavoring but the awful taste was too much for me to handle.  I have tried other energy drinks like Monster, and I did not care for the taste of those either. The taste of the Celsius Raspberry Acai actually reminded me of those drinks, the staleness and bad after taste. On a plus note, one can only has 10 calories compared to other energy drinks that are very high in calories.<br /><br />In regards to boosting your energy level, I could see a difference.  I only drank half of a can, and after a couple hours I felt very fidgety, energetic and wide awake.  However, my mouth keep watering like I was going to "up-chuck" and I kept burping up the flavor of the drink.<br /><br />Even if I was guaranteed I would loose one pound a day by consuming one can daily, I would still not be able to force myself to drink it.  Maybe the other flavors might be more appealing to my taste buds, but this flavor was not for me.

review/text: This is an interesting energy drink, with the promise of 100+ calorie burn just by drinking it down.  Without a laboratory, I cannot vouch for this.  However, it certainly does give an energy boost, even for an avid coffee drinker like me.  And I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor, it has a real ginger tang and not too sweet fruity flavor, although you can taste the artificial sweetener in it.  I did not get shaky or find my heart race after drinking this, but did feel more alert.  If you can tolerate the caffeine, it is a refreshing change from soda.

review/summary: Provides a nice energy boost
review/text: I am not an energy drink drinker nor am I addicted to caffeine.  The reason why I chose the Celsius drinks to review is that I feel as though I am all out of energy by around 3PM that I begin to doze off.  The added benefit of boosting my metabolism rate was also appealing.  I drinks I chose to review were the Celsius Peach Mango and the Raspberry Acai.<br /><br />Taste-wise it is so-so.  I have been drinking v8 vFusion Raspberry Acai flavor and have enjoyed the taste a lot.  I was hoping that this would taste somewhat similar, but was a bit disappointed.  I wasn't able to differentiate between the tastes of raspberry, acai, but was able to identify the green tea.  The taste which were decent.  However, I wasn't all that fond of the after-taste, which I was able to taste after each sip.  I don't like the taste of ginger, but could not taste it in this drink.<br /><br />Energy-wise, I did find that I felt a bit more energized, and was able to make it through the rest of the day without feeling sleepy.  I didn't experience any crashes.<br /><br />As this drink supposedly increases the metabolism rate, I weighed myself before drinking it and after.  I switched off between this Peach Mango flavor and the Raspberry Acai every day.  Without significantly changing my diet or exercise pattern, I did not notice any changes in weight.<br /><br />For the energy-boost alone, I would consider this drink a decent performer.  I would not purchase this for the taste or the claims of increase in metabolism rate.

review/summary: LOTSA Caffeine, Easy to drink
review/text: Here it is, simply said. This is one drink with a lot of caffeine.....200 mg of caffeine.  The drink is supposed to burn off 100 calories per fan, however whether it does not does not, it's not a whole lot.  I found it easy to drink down as it's non-carbonated so you don't end up with a huge burp after chugging it down.  I did not find it to have an over sweet taste.<br /><br />Now as some others posted here on if it's good for you.  Well in reality, no it's probably not good for you.  It's not a pure nutrient drink.  It's caffeine with a marketing added benefit of burning some calories.  But keep in mind most of what we eat and drink is not good for you. Especially stuff with caffeine.  Drink a few cans of this and expect a crash and or some shaking or your heart beating fast (palpitations).<br /><br />However if you don't like coffee, want a change or whatever if you drink this in the morning or need to be awake then a can or so of this (depending on how much caffeine you can handle) will keep you going fine.  Abuse it (as with anything) and it's not good.

review/summary: OK product....not so sure of the 'calorie burning' claims, though
review/text: I had never heard of the Celsius brand of canned iced tea before I got the case to review.  After trying it (along with some of my co-workers whom I shared the case with), we've pretty much come to similar conclusions:<br /><br />PROS - taste is ok, similar to other canned/bottled ice teas like Lipton (but not Snapple).  The tea seems to almost be some kind of energy drink (without it explicitly saying it's an energy drink - there is a warning about high caffeine sensitivity/content on the can).  On the other hand, it does NOT contain so much caffeine (like a Red Bull) that your heart will race.  Everyone that tried it said they felt more alert, but without the jittery/edgy feeling of so-called energy drinks, and without the crash a couple of hours later.  Each can only has 10 calories and the ingredients seem relatively innocuous/not a lot of chemicals.  Price per can works out similar to other energy-type drinks (though way more than soda).  Non-Carbonated.<br /><br />CONS--if you don't like Acai berries' taste, you will probably not like this tea - Acai has a somewhat tart aftertaste - the tea itself is also not terribly remarkable (compared to brands like Snapple and Arizona).  The calorie burning claims are pretty hard to verify - maybe the drink is intended to boost your energy before a workout, so you can work out more effectively?  Cans didn't seem too sturdy - one got punctured in transit, and several got dented (probably more of an issue if you have it shipped; not sure if this is available in stores?).<br /><br />Overall, an ok product, so you'll have to weigh the pro's and con's I mentioned.  If you like Acai taste, you might enjoy this more than most.

review/summary: Forget about the calorie burning claims...
review/text: I'll admit, I had a difficult time reviewing this. The Celsius bottle boasts not only that it is a great energy/workout drink, but that it boosts your metabolism to the point where you will be able to burn about 100 calories per can. The only downside to that claim? The average person is completely unable to validate this claim. I know I'm not- I can only say what I personally felt while I was drinking it.<br /><br />Taste:<br /><br />Eh... it's ok. It isn't the best energy drink flavor I've ever had, but it isn't the worst by any stretch. The flavor I had was raspberry acai green tea. While raspberry isn't one of my favorite flavors, I do love the taste of acai. Unfortunately this is a tart drink, so if you don't like sour-ish things then you probably won't like this. I know that the first time I tasted this I wasn't that enamored of the flavor. Over time it grew on me, though.<br /><br />Weight loss claims:<br /><br />I can't verify this as far as the calorie burning goes. So forget the calorie & metabolism claims. Obviously most people won't drink this expecting it to cause them to lose weight without effort, but since I can't prove that any calories burnt would be because of this drink (& not because of diet or exercise) I'm not going to believe the claims.<br /><br />Energy:<br /><br />Energy wise though, this drink is a winner. I've drank quite a few cans of this & its given me a great supply of energy. I drank a can yesterday because I was going to be pulling a VERY late day (up for close to 24 hours) & I felt fantastic 10-20 minutes after I'd finished the drink. I've had NO jitters or heart flutters from this at all, which is a biggie for me when it comes to energy drinks. If it causes me to be jittery or have any sort of abnormal heart stuff, I won't drink it on principle. (Seriously, why would I want to continue drinking something that made me feel like that?)<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent product if you are looking at it from an energy drink perspective. It only has 10 calories for the entire can, plus it has a nice load of vitamins thrown into it. The only warning I'd give a perspective drinker (other than to not put a lot of weight on the metabolism claims) is that you should eat something before drinking this. Normally I don't get an upset tum from drinking energy drinks on an empty stomach, but this one gave me a bit of an upset stomach until I ate something to settle it.<br /><br />As long as you are looking at this from an energy drink perspective, you should be fine & be happy with the product. I don't know that I'll be buying this in bulk like I do some of my favorite tea drinks or my chocolate soy milk, but it is something that I plan on purchasing every once in a while in single cans.

review/summary: Tastes Gingery - I like it!
review/text: Can't comment on the calorie burning properties, but I really like the way it tastes.  There's no fizz, and initially reminded me of Raspberry iced tea.  I could not place the after-taste or "tangyness" until I read the ingredients.  One of them is Ginger Root - that was the "ahhh" moment - that's what I was tasting. I'll be keeping several of these in the fridge from now on.  Great replacement for soda!  The can is a little unusual in size - it's similar to a Red Bull can in dimensions, only a little larger, so it's narrower and taller than a standard soda can.  Speaking of Red Bull, this also has the same main ingredients - Taurine.  It also has Green Tea, Niacin, vitamin B, Guarana and Caffeine.  So I would definitely call this an energy drink!<br /><br />It's also low in calories - 10 per serving, and one can is one serving (I hate those drinks that have xx calories per serving, but a can is 1 1/2 or 2 servings!)

review/summary: Doesn't work if you don't drink it...
review/text: That being said, I don't know if it does work if one does drink it because I just couldn't stomach it.<br /><br />The description boasts a blend of raspberry and acai that is "bittersweet"... Seems to me they left out the tartness of raspberry altogether and bitter is an appropriate word- unfortunately the combination of bitter and sweet equals a taste that is like a nibble of unripe fruit and a packet of sweet n' low/saccharine.  The taste is that foul and bitter.  The other flavors of Celcius seem to have better reviews here on Amazon and those may be worth a try, but raspberry acai is just unfortunate.  My first thought was that that they left the "ai" out of the "acai" (sorry to be crude, but really yucko tasting stuff)...<br /><br />I would like to try the other flavors as they seem more promising but I think I will taste them in one can experiments from a local convenient store and make sure I like them before being left with 23 cans of doorstop.<br /><br />The premise- 100 calories burned per can is quite appealing.  This product is marketed as a supplement. It does contain caffeine, guarana, and taurine, and a few other ingredients in their special blend, MetaPlus.<br /><br />Fingers crossed that one of the other flavors tastes better, as I could also use the 3-hour extended energy boost that the cans claim.

review/summary: One sip was enough
review/text: I was intrigued by the claim that this non-carbonated but caffeinated drink would actually burn calories although I wouldn't quite know how to really prove or disprove that it does. But I found it interesting enough to order this "dietary supplement", as it says on the can. At the very least I figured it would be healthy (green tea and acai) and taste great given that it contains: No sugar, no Aspartame, no preservatives, very low sodium, no high fructose corn syrup and no artificial colors or flavors.<br /><br />But I was in for a surprise - it tasted awful. Imagine a can of carbonated soda that was opened and then sat out on a table for a day and you get a pretty good idea of what this tastes like. Very flat and simply not good. Both my husband and I tossed it after just one sip. Even if it burned double the calories it claims to burn, I highly doubt I could down the entire 12 oz or even just a third of it. Maybe if it were carbonated that would help but honestly: Save yourself the money, this is NOT good.

review/summary: Great Drink
review/text: Love this drink and the taste is far better than most. I use the Amazon subscribe and save program with these. Just a word of warning though. Amazon is constantly changing their pricing on the case and prices will vary widely. My first order I paid about $23 for the case which was a great deal. Now they are over $34 for the same drink on the subscribe and save. So, if you see a good deal word to the wise it to buy more than a case at a time. Another word to the wise is not to use subscribe and save and assume the pricing will remain the same. Amazon changes the pricing and doesn't tell you. I am giving the drink a five but giving Amazon a one for the subscribe and save program.

review/summary: Disappointing taste and in general...just brew some green tea instead
review/text: This was disappointing. Didn't like the taste...too chemical. Too much caffeine for most. Little to no raspberry or acai in the product. And, we stopped using it because the oral mucosa of both of our mouths was irritated by the ingredients. Just brew some green tea. So much better. Add a little honey and chill it if you like. Peace to you and yours.

review/summary: Raspberry Acai flavor is not bad
review/text: I ordered both the Raspberry Acai flavor and the Peach Mango and the Raspberry Acai is definitely the winner of the two.  I thought the Peach Mango was awful with an especially bad aftertaste.  The Raspberry Acai is a bit too sweet for my taste but it is far more acceptable, even pleasant if very cold and I'm not getting the harsh aftertaste I got from the Peach Mango - not at all actually.  I am quite surprised that there is so much contrast between the two.  So if you're going to try this, definitely go for the Raspberry Acai and forget about the Peach Mango.  I have no idea if this stuff will do what it claims, but it does contain a lot of caffine, so be careful.  I can say that it woke me up pretty well when I used it and I did feel a bit warmer than normal for awhile, which was strange.  I'm not too happy that its sweetened with the artificial sweetener sucralose which is the same as Splenda.  Because of that and the fact that I'm not one for consuming caffeine, I won't be drinking this very often.

review/summary: I'm hooked...Love this stuff!!!
review/text: I can't speak for the carbonated flavors, but the Green Tea (Raspberry and Peach Mango) are delicious and give me the perfect amount of energy for the day. I did try the carbonated ginger ale once and was not impressed. I usually drink one can before morning workouts and it gives me the energy I need to power through a 1 -2 hour workout with ease. I don't think it's a miracle drink that's going to lose weight for me, but it definitely gives me a great boost of energy, and a much more refreshed feeling than I would normally get from coffee. I've actually pretty much given up coffee as a morning drink now and have a can of celsius instead.<br /><br />I would consider celsius a healthier and better tasting version of red bull or monster, etc. It was designed to be a healthy alternative to energy drinks loaded with sugar, with a twist of using a formula designed to help raise your metabolism and sustain energy for a few hours. It works!

review/summary: Not the worst tasting in the bunch!
review/text: When I saw that these were available I opted to try the "Green Tea Raspberry Acai" flavor.  The products claim is that it "burns up to 100 calories and more in each can".  This is a dietary supplement that is vitamin enriched.  My husband has begun working out as of late so these were a great purchase for us at this point.  As others have stated, the can is taller and thinner than a Red Bull can and contains 12 fl oz.<br /><br />Now onto the flavor... once you open the can you are hit with a raspberry "cleaner" scent.  That isn't necessarily bad, just a bit off.  It is a pleasant aroma, but not very appetizing to actually drink.  I personally did not like it, but can drink it for it's "supposed" claims.  My husband on the other hand enjoyed the flavor; rather LOVED it.  He drinks Gatorade, Vitamin Water etc etc... all the things that I detest flavor-wise.  Instead of taking someone else's review to heart, I think it would be a better idea for a prospective buyer to purchase one can in each of the available flavors and come to their own conclusion.  It all boils down to personal preference and taste buds!  For me it tasted a bit like a diet raspberry iced tea with a fake sweet aftertaste and fizzy feeling.  After reading the label and ingredients, I discovered that it contained sucralose (zero-calorie sugar substitute artificial sweetener) and ginger extract (fizzy ginger ale taste/feeling).<br /><br />I stopped after 1 big gulp because I noteiced that Celcius is not recommended for people that are caffeine sensitive, children under 12 or womem pregnant and nursing.  I personally need to avoid all caffeine for health reasons.  My husband felt very energetic throughout the day and didn't crash.  He was questioning whether it was a "placebo effect"; regardless he continues to drink Celcius because he likes the flavor and felt very energetic.<br /><br />Highly recommend to those that have sampled the product line before making the hefty purchase.<br /><br />Here is the break down of ingredient list:<br />1 serving per container<br />12 fl oz<br />Calories  10<br />Total Carbs  1g<br />Sugar  0g<br />Vitamin C  60mg<br />Riboflavin  1.7mg<br />Niacin  20 mg<br />Vitamin B12  6 mcg<br />Biotin  300 mcg<br />Panthothenic Acid  10mg<br />Calcium  50 mg<br />Chromium  50 mcg<br />Sodium  6 mg<br /><br />MetaPlus Proprietary Blend  1810 mg<br />Taurin<br />Guarana extract<br />Green Teal Leaf extract<br />Caffeine<br />Glucuronolactone<br />Ginger Extract<br /><br />Other Ingredients: Premium Brewed Green Tea Using Filtered Water, Citric Acid, Natural Flavors, Fruit and Vegetable Juice for Color, Sucralose.  Contains: 200 mg total caffeine per serving.

review/summary: More an energy drink than a calorie burner IMO
review/text: I think that this product is more an energy drink than a calorie booster, but that is my opinion of the product. The taste is pretty good for one of these kind of products (I hate the taste of other similar type drinks, especially Red Bull) While it's not quite as tasty as a soft drink, it's not that bad. I did feel more alert after drinking Celsius Raspberry Acai, but not fidgety. Not a prefect product, but not a bad one either! If this pruduct does help me loose some weight, I will update my review.

review/summary: Do the Hokey Pokey
review/text: This drink is loaded with stimulants. It made my heart race. My daughter had two before she realized what she was drinking and got the shakes for two hours. She said it was like she was doing the Hokey Pokey. So, be careful and realize what you're drinking. The taste to me was overly sweet. But the flavor was good.

review/summary: It seems to work but weak on taste.
review/text: Celsius, Green Tea Raspberry Acai is a vitamin enriched beverage that contains all of the "good stuff" and none of the "bad stuff" (No Sugar, No Aspartame, No Preservatives, No High Fructose Corn Syrup, No Artificial Colors or Flavors).  However the trade-off is simple "no flavor."  This drink is very weak tasting with a tart after-taste.  It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste good either.  The drink does claim to burn 100 calories or more per can, and it did give me energy (I think primarily from the B6 and B12 vitamins).  I can't confirm that it actually burns calories.  However, I can say that after drinking the product for several days--I drank one can each morning--I did lose a couple of pounds, and I had no bad after effects like you can get from other energy drinks.

review/summary: Celsius Raspberry Acai
review/text: This is a good tasting drink that tastes more like soda than a flavored tea. It uses sucralose which gives this drink the characteristic chemical-like bitter aftertaste I notice in all drinks that use artificial sweeteners. If the taste of artificial sweeteners and the possible harmful health effects from ingesting them doesn't bother you then you will enjoy this drink.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: When we visit Louisiana we buy this by the dozens. When we don't visit Louisiana, we order it online.<br />This is not like molasses in taste but it is like molasses in use. We use this to make gingerbread and it makes a better gingerbread than using molasses or dark corn syrup. We often use this to put on biscuits instead of using honey. When I make candied pecans I use this syrup. My husband prefers this over maple syrup for his pancakes.<br /><br />It is very thick and the colder it is, the slower it moves. As I said, it doesn't taste like molasses but it does have a bit of the aftertaste the same. It is used in our house interchangably.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Best syrup in the world.
review/text: I was born and raised in South Louisiana and have eaten Steens syrup all my life. It is like no other. A 1Qt. bottle at Walmart is between $4 and $5. Well worth the money.

review/summary: Best of the Best
review/text: I have shopped all over the internet for pure cane syrup and this is the best value considering the quality. It is definitely more expensive than buying off the grocer shelf, but there are not any stores in my area carrying it. Plenty of cheaper, cut with corn syrup, varieties, but that just won't do. :-)

review/summary: Authentic Sugar Cane Syrup!
review/text: I love Steen's. I grew up on the Gulf Coast where there were several people who made sugar cane syrup at home and sold it throughout the neighborhood. Now it's difficult to find genuine sugar cane syrup in the grocery stores, even in the south. I was really happy when I found Steen's website and ordered their 4-pack. Steen's syrup is delicious. It was like being home again. Homemade biscuits and Steen's sugar cane syrup.... or homemade pancakes and Steen's. If you like sugar cane syrup you won't disappointed with this product. However, if you've never had pure sugar cane syrup, you may find the taste very strong and, for some, overwhelming. That's the nature of pure sugar cane syrup.

review/summary: Use this and die a happy person!
review/text: I don't know about this particular product (as pictured and ordered) but this syrup is legendary! It's a cross between molasses and dark maple syrup, and is really indescribably delicious! Use it on pancakes or for a pecan pie, and you'll think you've died and gone to heaven. You CAN NOT get anything close to it once you're out of the south. Treat your self to something really special and buy Steen's syrup!<br /><br />-- a forlorn southerner SO thankful for the internet! :)

review/summary: Order direct
review/text: If you order from [...] I think you'll get the best prices and free shipping.<br />I'm ordering for the second time for nostalgia's  sake. I live in New England, but my mom grew up in north central Florida. We used cane syrup at home growing up, because it could be found in western NY stores, AND maple syrup. Different, but equally good.
