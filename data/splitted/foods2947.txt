review/summary: Light-hearted fantasy diversion
review/text: A haunting movie in which everything is played for laughs.<br /><br />There are no serious moments, deep introspections, revelations, life reviews, insights into life's purpose, etc. It is a non-stop gimmicks, special effects, sight gags, visual fluff suitable for the younger set.<br /><br />The hero and heroine drown together in a car accident, discover they are dead and back in their dearly beloved house. They can't leave because there are monsters outside. Their peace in interrupted by the new owners who decide to redo the place in a ridiculous gaudy style. They notice an unexpected book "The Handbook for the recently deceased." on the nightstand which serves as their guide to their new situation. Through it they discover how to reach their "caseworker" and an obnoxious haunter named Beetlejuice<br /><br />who might be able to help them remove the new occupants. Everything they try fails to work and in the end they accept the new owners. The owner's daughter becomes closer to them than her step-parents providing the child they always wanted and couldn't have. Other than the idea that they can not see themselves in a mirror and that the new owners cannot see them (except the daugthter), there is little we learn about the afterlife here. We see a couple brief scenes of the caseworker's office which can only be described as depressing. Worst movie I have seen in a long time.

review/summary: Great Movie...But NOT Given DELUXE Treatment
review/text: Why oh why do studios stamp "Deluxe Edition" on movies and then provide nothing to make it worthy of that title??????  I absolutely LOVE the movie Beetlejuice, and just about anything else Tim Burton has done.  The Blu-ray version of this movie looks and sounds better than any version I've seen before.  The colors are sharp and the sound is greatly improved over other DVD iterations I have seen before.  The movie comes with a nice slipcover featuring the cover art in lenticular motion.  That's about the only really special feature you are going to get on this disc.  With it being the 20th Anniv. of this film, I thought that surely something would have been included about the making of the film, but there is NOTHING.  There is no commentary track, no making of doc., no interviews with the cast.......NOTHING.  Oh you do get 3 episodes of the Beetlejuice cartoon.....yaawwwwnn and the original theatrical trailer.  I'm not complaining too much, because I do love this movie, and it is worth the price just to see it in High Definition.  It just ticks me off a little when studios stamp the "Deluxe Edition" on the cover, when there is nothing Deluxe about it.

review/summary: Burton's true debut!
review/text: At the time of its release in 1988, 'Beetlejuice' was a huge hit. Although it does seem a little dated now, it still has some wonderful visual jokes (especially the characters in the waiting room). The laughs begin with the main characters' deaths after only 10 minutes. They look expectantly at a little dog who is balancing their car on a plank of wood over the edge of a bridge. He tip-toes off and they fall to their deaths. The film is full of satirical vignettes e.g. the after-life is managed by a number of desk clerks who have condemned themselves to an eternity as civil servants because they committed suicide. The Deetz's interior designer Otho is unafraid of all the ghoulish horrors that surround him, but yet finds himself in his most frighteneing moment when Betelguise removes his designer suit to reveal a 70's pastel leisure suit and he runs in terror.<p>Apparently director Tim Burton loved making the film as Warners stayed off his back for most of it, so he had greater freedom to improvise with the actors and the story. Half-way through its making, he didn't know how it was going to end. The stop-motion techniques might look a little dated but Burton was a big fan of Godzilla as a child.

review/summary: Fabulous Comedic Fanasy Directed by a Master
review/text: Beetlejuice is an awe-inspiring wonderfully amusing comedic romp that explores the incredible possibilities of the after-life and the boundaries of the absurd. Telling the tale of a recently dead married couple that suddenly gets led into the chaotic world of the supernatural. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) discover many of the conflicting rather human imperfections that haunt the lives of the living also plague the afterlife as well.<p>Unlike some film projects that seemed to be blindly assigned to dispassionate filmmakers for commercial reasons, Beetlejuice's plot and bizarre subject matter remarkably complemented Burton's unusually macabre artistic sensibilities extraordinarily well. Created by the unbelievably brilliant guidance of imaginative film director, Tim Burton (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). The film's uniquely creative landscape was a culmination of essentially all of the abundant irony and outlandish yet human behaviors that have graced the body of Burton's work.<p>Augmented by deviously energetic performances from Glenn Shadix, Jeffrey Jones, Winona Ryder, Catherine O' Hara, Geena Davis, and Alec Baldwin, the film bustles with uninhibited brilliant hilarity that persistently pushes the film to a level of almost affable euphoria. Paired with its ingenious screenplay and a tour de force performance by Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. This film transforms itself into an exuberant jovial exercise that is extremely satisfying and philosophically perceptive on many levels. Though comedy is usually considered to be unable or undeserving of deep critical analysis, Beetlejuice is an undeniably inspired concept that has been flawlessly transferred to film. One of the most outstanding comedies of the 1980's. <p>As for the film's DVD package, the DVD includes the theatrical trailer, an isolated Danny Elfman musical track, and the choice to watch the film in anamorphic widescreen or Pan and Scan. Hopefully Beetlejuice will eventually be graced with a special edition. We can always hope.

review/summary: Blueray:  Great movie.  Blue-Ray-Okay
review/text: I have the DVD, and added the Blue-Ray.  A very good movie.  It is very re-watchable. It's also a good opportunity to view some famous actors in much younger days.  A much younger Alec Baldwin is hardly recognizable. Michael Keaton really isn't recognizable due to the makeup used, even though he played a great part.  Wynona Ryder plays a great part as always.  Gina Davis and Catherine O'Hara played their parts well.  Although the PQ was very good, I really didn't see any appreciable improvement in the PQ or Audio, over the earlier DVD.  I have a 5.1 system, with Polk Speakers.<br /><br />There is only one disc. There was no paper insert. The separate audio soundtrack (on the same Blue-Ray disc), failed to play on my Panasonic BD60 (with all firmware updates). Everything else played.  If you have the DVD, I don't see any benefit in getting the Blue-Ray.  I guess that's why the price dropped to close to single digits.  I'm really starting to question the benefits of Blue-Ray over DVDs.  In most Blue-Ray movies, I've watched, extras, present on earlier releases, have been removed.  I thought that was a major selling point in the Blue-Ray movement.

But anyone can enjoy this far-fetched comedy. Being PG, it should be appropriate for most members of the family.

review/summary: Some early details about the new 20th Anniversary Beetlejuice DVD due out on September 16th, 2008
review/text: Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's "Banana Boat Song" ("Day-O"), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />This new release is being marketed as the 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition.  It will be newly remastered, but the extras announced so far are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series ("Skeletons in the Closet," "Spooky Boo-tique," "A-Ha!"), a music-only track, and the trailer.  The cartoons are about 11 minutes each.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but usually that doesn't happen.  I've subtracted one star for the poor features in a "deluxe" anniversary edition; if they announce more features I may up my rating.  The best thing is likely to be the remastering, which is needed, since the older DVD wasn't all the great.  Looking forward to that.

review/summary: Tim Burton Goes All Out in His Second Feature Film!
review/text: Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

Tim Burton knew what he was doing, aparently, because this film is unbelievably entertaining. The dialogue is clever, the story is wonderful and the characters make the film shine. Winona Rider is marvelous as the troubled gothic teenager who wears black and veils to the dinner table. Her mother is a power woman designer who turns the house into a Tim Burton Dream land where all sorts of goodies can happen, especially with a little tampering from a few ghosts. This film also has a great score from Danny Elfman who worked with him previously on Batman and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. After this the director/composer duo have never split up and togehter they create magic for everyone to see and love.

review/summary: Remains one of my favorites
review/text: Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.

One such prospective poltergeist is Beetlejuice- brilliantly played by Michael Keaton. <p>Featuring a star-studded cast including a young Winona Ryder, Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin and of course Keaton, the storyline boasts creative, believable characters simply not seen in movies these days. <p>Everything in the storyline is clever, from props to costumes right down the score. One of my absolute favorite films!

review/summary: A little gross, a lot of fun
review/text: Michael Keaton was already on his way to being a major star when he played the ghost with the most in "Beetlejuice." His performance in the title role simply solidified his status as one of Hollywood's brightest comedy stars.<p>Now, years later, this film still generates the same belly laughs that it did when it was first released. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis have fun in their roles as husband and wife who are surprised to find themselves dead, but they are merely window-dressing for Keaton's centerpiece. The only complaint here is that there are a few too many gross-out gags, but that is something which has come to define many of director Tim Burton's films. Still, the movie is a lot of fun from beginning to end, and it's worth considering adding it to your video collection.

review/summary: A fresh, original film from master storyteller Tim Burton
review/text: This is such a great film, I don't even know how to sum it up. First of  all, it is completely original and it is unlike any film I have ever seen  before. Second of all, it's a great comedy with kind of a spooky, weird  feel to it, which is something all of Tim Burton's films have. The look of  the film is probably what I like the best. Art Director Bo Welch and Tim  Burton show us a world unlike anything seen in a movie.  This is a great  film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable,  entertaining film that is original and inventive.

The first thing i noteced was that the disc was double sided! about halfway thru I had to flip the disc over to watch the rest of the movie. and another thing: It was censored. I don't mean just the "violence" i mean language. Then I bought the PG-13 version hoping for a better verson. Instead I found out it was the same thing, just with a different cover. So i reccomend you buy the VHS.<br /><br />Trust me, it sucks.

review/summary: Some early details about the new Blu-ray DVD due out September 16th, 2008
review/text: Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's "Banana Boat Song" ("Day-O"), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />The extras announced are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series ("Skeletons in the Closet," "Spooky Boo-tique," "A-Ha!"), a music-only track, the trailer and, according to the press release but not the Warners Brothers web page for this DVD, an exclusive CD soundtrack sampler.  The cartoons are about 11 minutes each.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but that would be unusual and I wouldn't count on it.  Five-star movie, three-star extras.<br /><br />The new Blu-ray will be 1080p video, but the complete specs for the sound haven't been announced.  There will be sound and subtitles in several languages, including Spanish.  The old standard DVD isn't all that great in terms of video quality, so the best thing about this new release is likely to be improved image and sound.

review/summary: It's Funny To Think The Titular Character Is Only In The Movie Less Than Twenty Minutes
review/text: Beetlejuice is a movie I consider to be one of Tim Burton's best movies. I also consider it to be one of those kind of movies that could have come out only in the 80s (much like Labyrinth starring David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly).<br /><br />Beetlejuice deals with a recently deceased married couple, the Maitlands, who finds themselves essentially "trapped" in their former house for the next century or so. Unfortunately, this means living with the house's new owners, the Deetz. The Maitlands don't mind Deetz daughter Lydia played by Winona Ryder so much but her much more obnoxious parents and want to scare them away from the house. Their case worker tells them only one thing: to NEVER even think about recruiting her former assistant Beetlejuice. Unfortunately, they manage to resist for a while before giving in and Beetlejuice causes nothing but problems.<br /><br />It's definitely a work by Tim Burton. His ever-present "uniqueness" and charm is there. Beetlejuice is a fun 80s movie and a very fun watch period. the acting by everyone involved in the movie is great (especially Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice). The make-up for the necessary characters were well done and the "afterlife" set designs and make-up there were great. I loved the make-up and designs in the afterlife scenes.<br /><br />The movie itself is great and I would have given it five stars. The blu-ray as a whole leaves a little to be desired. It's one of those DVDs or blurays that pretty much leaps right into the movie. No title screen, scene selection, anything. This was a bit annoying since I had to manually go skip through the whole movie to get back to where I left off the night before. There's a small handful of special features that you may or may not be interested in. The special features are only three episodes of the cartoon series (of which I watched as a kid) and an audio track. The special features it does have really aren't that bad, I would have just liked to have had more. Like some sort of commentary, deleted scenes, or something.<br /><br />All in all, five stars for movie itself and three for the blu-ray (averaging four stars).

review/summary: "Please, they're dead. It's a little late to be neurotic."
review/text: Oh, snap, that's right, Alec Baldwin once upon a time was svelte, as so documented in BEETLEJUICE, the 1988 film that - along with CLEAN AND SOBER - made a case for Michael Keaton having a streak dark and dangerous enough to qualify him for the then upcoming Batman role.<br /><br />It can be tough when you're newly shuffled off that mortal coil, tough when the shelf life exceeds the expiration date. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Baldwin and Geena Davis) - a young couple in love - are freshly minted ghosts who find themselves confined to their quaint New England home, and they seem content enough with their new sitch. But when a family of obnoxious artsy-fartsy New Yorkers move into their house and threatens to annihilate their peace of mind, the Maitlands may have no recourse but to contract that shady freelance "bio-exorcist" Betelgeuse. Certainly, the Handbook for the Recently Deceased isn't much help. Adam and Barbara's irascible case worker Juno - who is supposed to ease them into the afterlife - worsens things by remarking that the Maitlands must spend 125 years on Earth in their house before they can move on. Anyway, it's a delectable twist, this meek and retiring ghostly couple being haunted - and bullied - by the living. BEETLEJUICE, as if you didn't know, is a hugely entertaining supernatural comedy. Harry Belafonte's catchy calypso music simply acts as a bonus.<br /><br />The Maitlands' bridge to the living is Winona Ryder's appealingly strange little goth girl, Lydia Deetz. Lydia is pretty much the only "house guest" that Adam and Barbara can tolerate and they, in turn, become surrogate parents to Lydia whose real parents (a shrill Catherine O'Hara, a distracted Jeffrey Jones), let's face it, tend to neglect her to bits. Lydia demonstrates an unnatural awareness of the ghostly Maitlands, and it's her curiosity which helps propel a major plot point - namely, Betelgeuse's getting his hooks into the Maitlands. Adam and Barbara prove to be too mild-mannered and just too nice to put a proper fright into the Deetzes - their idea of scaring the mortals is to possess them and make them dance to Harry Belafonte. Conversely, Betelgeuse embodies equal traits of perversity and meanness and he right away cows the Deetzes; the Deetzes' family friend, Otto, especially has it coming. But then we learn that Betelgeuse has his own nasty end game in mind, with no one but the Maitlands and the spunky little girl, Lydia, to thwart him. As likable as Baldwin and Davis are, Michael Keaton's awesomely manic, joke-a-second performance fuels the movie. He injects just enough demonic chops to come across as a sinister adversary.<br /><br />Director Tim Burton put Hollywood on notice with PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE, and BEETLEJUICE only expanded his street creds. BEETLEJUICE exhibits Burton's bag of tricks - the distinctive style, the touch of artistic creativity, that smidge of the surreal and the fantastic. There's a lot of visual treats, ranging from the storybook look of the Maitland home to the bizarre architecture of the offices of the supernatural underworld. The dazzlingly inventive sight gags add to the film's offbeat humor. That waiting room is almost as diverting as the Star Wars cantina in terms of ambiance and their inhabitants. All in all, BEETLEJUICE is an astonishing, demented spin on the classic ghost story. Exorcism has never been more fun... or backwards.<br /><br />So this DVD is The 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition and offers these paltry bonus features:<br /><br />- 3 BEETLEJUICE Cartoon Episodes: "A-Ha!", "Skeletons in the Closet," & "Spooky Boo-tique"<br />- the option to watch the film in Music-Only Track<br />- Theatrical Trailers for BEETLEJUICE and PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE

review/summary: It's show time!
review/text: Of all the movies that Tim Burton did, there are three names that come out a lot during discussions. Of course his two Batmans, then his masterpiece Edward Scissorhands,  but most of all his excellent comedy Beetlejuice. Why's that? Because as a society where we usually consider the after-life as a dark and depressing world, Tim Burton presents death in a different perspective. He represents it as an extremely funny world where people become ghosts stuck in their own houses and are haunted by the living, a world where death is a huge bureaucracy, and a world where there are bio-exorcists, like the one and only Mr. Beetlejuice. Although this is a movie where the main characters are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, and they do an excellent job as a recently dead-couple, it's Michael Keaton who deserves the spotlight. For each time he appears on the screen, he just makes you laugh with his funny one-liners (excellent improvisation from Michael Keaton) and his perfect interactions with his co-stars such as Sylvia Sidney, Winona Ryder, Glenn Shaddix, Jeffrey Jones, and Catherine O`Hara, all future collaborators during Tim Burton`s career. Everyone, and I mean everyone, delivers a perfect performance.<br /><br />Not only that it is a movie that has excellent visual effects, both traditional and with the computer. Also, I loved how they were able to integrate gorgeous stop-motion animations during the movie. They were well integrated in the movie and are a proof that this kind of animation can really bring great possibilities to a movie, though there are certain limits to it of course. But hey, that also counts for CGI too.<br /><br />Finally, a great cheer to Danny Elfman, whose soundtrack really gave him the popularity and respect he deserved. A great idea from the makers of this DVD to integrate the soundtrack as a separate audio track.<br /><br />In the end, a great classic that should be listened over and over again and being considered a classic of modern american cinema.

Alec Baldwin, and Geena Davis do a credible job in their roles as newly departed homeowners caught up in underworld bureaucracy, and Wynona Ryder is delightful as the morbidly-inclined daughter of the 'bio' invaders of the home Baldwin, and Davis don't want to move on from. There are very few dark farces as comically twisted as this delightful romp through the afterlife, and none with a more hilarious lead anywhere. I haven't grown tired of watching this macabre laugh-riot in twenty years, and unless you're missing a funny bone, you won't either.

review/summary: The ghost with the most
review/text: After 20 years, this oddball dark comedy hasn't lost its irreverent impact. Up-and-coming director Tim Burton's playfully twisted visual style runs rampant through this movie, saturating nearly every frame. It even turns actor Michael Keaton into sort of a vile living cartoon, the one & only Beetlejuice, a manic bio-exorcist with sinister agendas. The film also boosted the resumes of terrific talents like Jeffrey Jones & Catherine O'Hara (here as an annoying trendy couple transplanted from New York to a small Connecticut town). The film helped maked stars of Geena Davis & Alec Baldwin (as the kind, hapless ghostly couple) and Winona Ryder (as the ex-New Yorker's death-obsessed daughter, Lydia). But this is really Keaton's movie all the way, in spite of a good cast.<br />The art direction, make-up & special effects have Burton's distinctive stamp all over them.<br />I was slightly disappointed that this 20th Anniversary Edition didn't have at least interviews or a making-of featurette (although it includes a handful of the delightful "Beetlejuice" animated episodes).<br />However, it's a little offbeat comedy that's achieved cult status over the years (all you have to do is view it to figure out why). Just don't say the title three times!

review/text: I give the blu-ray version of Beetlejuice five stars for the picture and sound quality alone.  The improvements compared to the previous DVD release are HUGE.  If I had to choose between warner spending money and time on a better transfer or more extra content, I would choose the better transfer.  After all, how many times are you going to watch behind the scenes material or a commentary?  It's been twenty years since this film was released, so it would be difficult for Tim Burton or anyone involved in the film to remember enough material for a commentary or even for short featurettes.  I'd rather have no commentary than a bad one.  This comes with a CD sampler of the soundtrack which is a nice addition.  I could care less about the episodes of the animated series even though I watched it as a kid.  My favorite aspect of this release is seeing the detail on the stop-motion puppets, the surreal set design, and Oscar winning makeup.  I can't recommend this enough.

review/summary: ONE OF THE BEST GHOST STORIES I KNOW.....
review/text: Here is a movie that is top notch in a lot of ways. It's a great family movie. Some may not agree, but I say it is. Adults will understand it more but kids will love the colorful creatures, even though several aspects of the film will fly right over their heads. Tim Burton really hit the button here on his unique style of filmaking, and really never did it better, even with the number of great films he's waxed his style all over through the years.<br /><br />The story starts with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as "The Recently Deceased."  They have to learn how to be ghosts, and it's not easy. That is why there is a department dedicated to helping their cause, however, it is as backed up as an inner city welfare office. This is why sleazy swindlers such as the title character come around, dedicated to taking advantage of their delicate situation.<br /><br />When our ghosts discover that they have to share their small town dream home, with some living artsy-fart aristocrats, it's more then they can bare. SO, as most ghosts would do in this situation, they decide to scare the new tennants away. However, their obvious inexperience proves as a pitfall. Especially since these a*holes get a kick out of it, and start using them as party favors. Enter Michael Keaton as Beedle Geuss (He needs somebody to pronounce his name right).  The couple, desperate, go against the wishes of the department and hire him, to give the new tennants a proper scare. Although they soon realize that they may have gotten in too far over their heads with this ghoul.<br /><br />Lydia, played by Winonna Ryder, is the disillusioned daughter of the artsys and she somehow naturally communicates with the dead, and becomes a friend to the couple. Naturally she becomes the prime target for Beetlejuice also (If I was a sleazy ghoul, I would be all over her too!) and thats when things get ugly. But don't worry too much, because in the end everyone figures out how to compromise, and dance around the house to the tune of Shake Senora. The comedic icing of the whole demented cake.<br /><br />This movie works just as well as a comedy, as it does a terrific ghost story. The effects are great, and a symbol to what made Tim Burton so cool early in his career (who can forget those claymation sand serpents?) The score is perfectly creepy, and this thing is just an all around great movie. Good stuff for the Halloween film fest peeps. I pull it out all the time!

review/text: This is an early film in Tim Burton's career,shortly after Pee Wee's Big Adventure where you get to see his off humor,art and design poured into the film.This is a Tim Burton classic hands down and I love the humor put into the story(spoken or not).Some strong four letter metephores are thrown upon occassion in some of the dialog,so parents beware if you have little ones watching.Other than that,you have an entertaining story of a young couple who die sudenly and are thrown into the world of the dead without a clue of how,why and what to do?Pathetic attempts are made to scare and rid their home of an undesireable yuppie family.In desperation(even after being warned) they decide to employ the gifts and tallents of Beettlejuice,and it turns out they get more than they bargined for.I only wish there was more screen time with Michael keaton/Beettlejuice,it is damn funny.While the living mingle with the dead in an effort to make a circus of their "paranormal hosts" Beetlejuice is put into action again by Lydia to save them.So,"say it once,say it twice...third time is the charm!"Experience Beettlejuice for yourself,and if you are a Tim Burton fan or new to his films,you are in for a real treat.

review/text: Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as a very convincing couple with great chemistry), are dead. Now they can't leave their sprawling New England home. Good thing they've got the "Handbook for the Newly Deceased" to help guide them on their way through the beuracratic world of the dead.<br /><br />They've got a problem. A new living family (Cahterine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder) is inhabiting their house. Worse than that, they're remodeling the place. What's a pair of ghosts to do? When they can't scare them out, they call on the help of the famous Bio-Exorcist: Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton in his best role ever).<br /><br />What results is a mixture of dark comedy and sweet special effects (for the late 80's at least) set in front of stunningly imaginative and interesting scene design.<br /><br />Beetlejuice is a classic, and if you haven't seen it yet, now's your chance. Since this is an old DVD there really aren't many special features. Just a lot of written "Notes" on the film, but even those are pretty cool.

review/summary: It's SHOWTIME!!!
review/text: That quote "And it keeps getting funnier every single time I see it" will be put to good use, because that is what you'll say when you watch this movie again and again. What is there to say about Tim Burton? He can't stop with the good movies!<br /><br />This has to be up there in at least the top 20 of the best comedies of all time. It's twisted, but very very funny. I swear to you, if you watch this film, you will get one laugh. Probably more if you give it a chance.<br /><br />And of course, Beetlejuice is now one of the most famous charactors in movie history. Way to go, Tim!

review/text: I used to want to recommend this to anyone a while ago, and I still do! Beetlejuice is the kind of film that I sometimes like to watch more than once in a row. It used to be my favorite movie and I still very much enjoy it!! This IS the kind of movie where you have to watch out who sees it, but I do not think it's scary at all and  it is a classic.

review/summary: Beetlejuice is a greatmovie, but they cheated you on the dvd
review/text: Just to warn you. when in trying to trick you in the widescreen format, the company made a mistake by also including the full screen version with it.  i compared the widescreen and the full screen. and the full screen seems to comtain more picture at the top and bottom.  which must mean, that all they did was take the full screen version, cut off the top a bottom slightly and call it widescreen.  which is strange because i would expect it to be easier just to make the theatrical version than to carefully edit the full screen and rip many people off.

review/summary: Bettlejuice...Bettlejuice...BETTLEJUICE!
review/text: What happens when you say his name three times? Michael Keaten stars in this comedy about two couples that live in an old two story house.  While coming back from a supply store, the couple suddenly get caught inside of a  &quot;broken-up&quot; bridge and then just before they start to tumble down  into the lake, a board catches them.  But just when they've got their hopes  up, and small dog steps on the board and the car starts to slide off the  bridge and into the lake waters.  A few minutes later...<p>They find  themselves back into their home, they find that somehow somehad light the  fireplace, as if done by magic.  From then on, they find a weird-looking  dead guy known as Bettlejuice.  The only way they can get him for help is  to call him by his name three times and he will appear at their survice.  But they soon wish that they have never called his name, because  Bettlejuice was once a troublemaker but he is the only one who can save  them, on the account that they said his name three times.  They can't leave  their houses or else they will find theirselves in another world with giant  sandworms.  This is a stellar comedy that you should see! Michael Keaton is  awesome as he plays the leading role of Bettlejuice.

review/summary: FABULOUS CURRY SET!!! (Conveinient & Easy Recipes!)
review/text: Quick reference review here: (1) This curry set gives you the following 6 curries 4 oz. each - Green (made w/ green chiles), Masaman (rich & mild for stews), Prik Khing (hot, peppery & spicy), Panang (moderate heat), Red (made w/ dried red chiles), Yellow (most mild and mellow of Thai curries). For each curry you can make about 20 servings and the leftover paste can be stored in fridge or freezer. For each curry it gives you an authentic recipe - which are easy to follow with fairly common ingredients found in most grocery stores - AND DELICIOUS! I enjoy cooking and trying new recipes. HIGHLY RECOOMMEND, not to mention the vendor sent the package within 10 days (I live in Italy too!) and sent an invitiation to their spice club. For more info check out their website at [...] --YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!

review/text: I like being adventurous in the kitchen. This Thai curry assortment is a great way to do it! The level of difficulty is low and the ingredients list are readily available at your local store.<br /><br />So, if you want a change of pace, or want to suprise your partner with something different then you'll like these. Granted the cans of curry are quite cheap purchased directly at the store, the value lies in the recipes, giving the novice Thai cook a blueprint for success.<br /><br />Great as a gift too!

review/text: I was looking for a chicken/duck dog treat that isnt made in China (most of the popular ones state that they are on their packaging). This one, with its dual French/English labeling and Free Range title, appeared to be a North American free-range organic-type natural product. Especially given the price. But it is NOT, it is also made in China. Upon closer inspection it says this product has no ADDED hormones, antibiotics, preservatives... but it doesnt say the product is FREE OF these additives. I feel duped, and I am returning.  I can get the same China-quality for half the price without being taken for a ride.

review/summary: Highest currency
review/text: Dogs know which treats they like best.  These are my dog's very favorite so I refer to them by saying, "I'll give you a million dollars."  Now that he knows this phrase, it gets him moving when he's reluctant to get in the car, or helps change his mind about an agility obstacle that makes him nervous.  I also use these as high-value treats for classical conditioning; I give these out when my dog is meeting a new person, or when I'm talking to a neighbor in the backyard, to create positive associations so he's less likely to bark.  Of course he also loves getting these just as a treat.  A bag of these treats can be stretched by cutting each one into about 3 pieces to use for training (big enough to still be chewy instead of swallowed whole), but I leave some whole for regular treats.  A whole one is big enough that my dog will carry it away to eat, and he will guard it from another dog, so be aware of that if your dog is a resource guarder.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying these.  Don't be fooled by the tear notch above the zipper; when I open the bag this way the zipper ends up getting ripped.  Cut the bag open above the zipper to make sure you can reseal it.  The thick plastic keeps the treats fresh.

review/summary: Dog Treats
review/text: These Chicken and Sweet Potato dog treats are the all time favorite in our home...not for me but for my dogs.  I was so happy to see them at such a great price, but when I received them I found that all 5 bags (2 priced at regular price) all had expired dates on them and they were not soft but very hard.  They all expired last year.  I realize they're dogs, and I realize the body parts they lick can't be any worse than some expired dog treats, but knowing that most dog treats, including these, come from China, and with the pet food issues that we have had, I just think that the expiration dates should be noted on the item description, and let the buyer beware. Otherwise, bar none my dogs love these treats, I shouldn't make that public than they will really go up in price and be even more difficult to find!

review/summary: Organic manicotti!!
review/text: If you buy organic, then you will know how difficult it is to find out of the ordinary pastas, at least in my area. With an italian background, finding organic manicotti was such a treat! These pasta noodles are great tasting and long lasting. With a case of 12 it took some time to get through because I usually only make it for holidays or a special occasion. The last box was as great as the first. I found that the pasta shells  were pretty much whole maybe one or two in a couple of boxes were broken, but not unsalvageable(and that's out of a surprising 14 shells per box). I cook them for 4 minutes then remove them from the boiling water and place them in cool water. I use a sealable storage bag to stuff them by trimming about 3/4" to 1" off of one corner and gently squeezing the filling into the manicotti shell. Using plenty of sauce in the baking dish makes up for the short boiling time. They stay together and do not split while filling with this method. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to make a special dish more healthy! Enjoy!

review/summary: "It's the Best Kind"
review/text: My son just returned from two months in Mysore in southern India.  He was told to use MTR for Indian cooking, because "it's the best kind."  He just cooked us a meal using MTR's Chana Masala powdered spice mix--adding onions and chick peas.  It was delicious, especially with a little fresh mint chutney using mint from our garden and the recipe from the new Joy of Cooking.  I can't vouch for all MTR products, but I'm definitely going to try some more!

review/text: I have been trying to eat less ramen.<br />This product is just as fast and easy, and it may even be tastier.<br /><br />You can't expect restaurant-quality food, but you can expect a great taste relative to the amount of time it takes to make.<br /><br />I usually use flavorful brown rice, some sriracha, lots of black pepper, and a little bit of salt.<br /><br />One pack usually provides 2 servings for me (with lots of brown rice).<br /><br />PS: If you are microwaving this, either cover the chickpeas with the rice (my preferred method), or make sure to use a microwave cover!

review/summary: Sturdy Side Dish
review/text: This curried side dish has a rich, complex flavor, mixing firmly cooked chickpeas with a pungent but not overpowering gravy.  Considering how many packaged foods claim to be "spicy" but don't even pass for mild, this veggie side has flavor to make you sit up and take notice.  This is no afterthought; you could plan dinner around this dish.<br /><br />One word of warning: the instructions say you could prepare this dish in the microwave.  I found out, though, that if you do, the chickpeas explode quite forcefully.  I recommend preparing this dish using the stovetop directions, which are straightforward and don't take that much longer.

review/text: I have ordered countless things from Amazon that say "Pack of 6" in the description.  This time I received one package of applesauce and they told me that since it contains 6 cups that that is the pack of 6.  The only reason that I am not giving this product 0 stars is because Amazon was kind enough to say they would refund my money (who in their right mind would pay over $10 for 1 package of applesauce???).  Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: Bacon + Hot Sauce = Yum!
review/text: I love bacon, and like hot sauce. This terrific sauce is truly a sauce and not a salsa. It is a very well-balanced sauce with lots of smokey/spicy flavors and an excellent, but not overwhelming flavor of bacon. While I don't believe that there's actually any bacon in the sauce (because it's listed as kosher) it is perfect for adding bacon flavor to omelettes, breakfast burritos, eggs of any kind, sandwiches, and well, everything. Also adds a great flavor to marinades.<br /><br />My first bottle I enjoyed using, but thought it was a little pricey vs. the $2 Trader Joe's Chili Sauce which it resembles. I got my first Bacon Hot Sauce from a friend who got a few sample bottles from somewhere. Once it was gone, I found myself missing it and here I am buying a 3-pack! There's no replacement for the rich flavor it brings.

review/summary: I like it
review/text: At first I was a little disappointed when I tried it on the end of my finger, but it has grown into one of my favorites.<br /><br />The best use of it so far was when I added it to a pan sauce from the drippings of a smoked brisket.  It works very well when you are trying to spice up meat dishes, not so well with vegetable based foods.  It is savory, which is why I think it is better suited to meats.<br /><br />-It has a consistency that is close to Tabasco, which is fairly thin.<br />-On the hotness scale it is similar to Tabasco again, but it is slightly less hot.<br />-It is just a little smoky, and light on the bacon flavor which works very well.

review/text: I bought this stuff from ThinkGeek.  I didn't know that it was sold here until now.<br /><br />I love bacon and I love hot sauce, *all* kinds of hot sauce, so I thought this would be a great product; two of my favorite things rolled into one.  But the execution on this one is 90% wrong.  The amount of sodium in this product burns your tongue almost as much as the peppers in the sauce.  The liquid smoke is waaaay overpowering.  It's well over the top.  So, this stuff tastes like salted smoke.  No real bacon flavor here.  They totally need to rework the recipe on this one, and I hope that they do.  I'd give it a second try if they did.  Until then, it's a bacon FAIL.<br /><br />Better luck next time!

review/summary: Does not taste like bacon
review/text: Received USPS, packaged well. Took a while to get here. So long, I forgot I had ordered it.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is that there is no 'sprinkling spout' in the top. There is a screw top cap then the top of the bottle is open. The opening is fairly large so you must be careful pouring it.<br /><br />Taste. It does not taste like bacon. It is not very hot. I can eat it from a spoon without having to drink anything afterwards. It taste like liquid smoke with spices added. It is ok but not something I really like. It is ok on a fried egg sandwich. It is ok used to cook popcorn.<br /><br />I will finish the bottle but I doubt I will reorder it. If I change my mind, which I sometimes do with food, I will update.

review/summary: Good for the hot sauce light weight who want's a little smokey flavor added to their food.
review/text: I'm a big hot sauce fan and this one failed me on two levels.  I like bacon, and I can't say that it tastes like bacon to me.  I do get the strong smoke flavor though -- which is not all bad as it will lend a smokey accent to any food if you like that kind of thing. I don't.  The heat level of this sauce is pretty mild. My favorite everyday hot sauce is Belizian Heat, and compared to that, this is ketchup. I'm tempted to say this seems milder than Tobasco, but I may be overwhelmed by the smokiness of the sauce and can't gauge the heat very well. This would be perfect for someone that can't handle really hot sauces but would like to add a bit of kick and a smokey flavor to foods. For those people, a couple of drops (5 - 10) in a bowl of chili will do you good!
