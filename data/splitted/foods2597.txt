review/summary: great product
review/text: I was amazed at how well these cleaned my dogs teeth. He is not happy with getting his teeth brushed, especially in the back, the Greenies have assisted with cleaning this hard to reach area. I have read other reviews where people have had trouble with their dogs trying to chew off too much and choking or what-ever - my solution stay with your dog as they chew anything this is just plain common sense. I also give it after his evening meal so that he won't try to swallow to big of bites.

review/summary: Very good value - but manufacturer should switch to a larger bulk bag
review/text: This was an Excellent value of buying on Amazon versus the pet stores.<br />It was packaged and labeled well for shipment.<br /><br />However - the manufacturer's plastic top of the box itself is a little cheap and less functional than I expected.  Frankly, the whole top has to come off each time I want to give my dog a single chew.<br /><br />So - I'm actually putting these chews into a Dog treat jar that has a open-and-close top with a tab.<br /><br />The manufacturer could simply change the bulk packaging to a bag.  Frankly, a Ziploc bag would be just as functional (and probably have a lower manufacturing cost) than the box.

review/summary: Suppliers Make All the Difference!
review/text: Since all Greenies are the same I would suppose that only the suppliers of Greenies could make the difference, and this one certainly did!<br />We received our order for an amazing cocker spaniel in very good time, which made us all very happy!<br />And as far as price goes, that was really a surprise!<br />Even with postage these healthy treats cost less than we had been paying for them in pet stores here in Salt Lake City!<br />You can surely look forward to many more orders from us!<br />Thanks for the great treatment!!!!<br />Ray, Joan and Taz<br /><br />PS  I HAVE NO IDEA OF HOW THE IDENTIFYING PICTURE OF THE PRODUCT I REVIEWED GOT SWITCHED!<br /><br />HOWEVER, PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR DOG EAT THE MICROFIBER CLOTHS (EVEN THE GREEN ONES)!!!!!!!!!

review/text: My Shih Tzu is seven and has had one Greenie a day for years.  She is happy, healthy and has great teeth.  She begs for her Greenie every morning.  Don't worry about Greenies causing allergies!  The main source of allergies is CORN in dog food.  Do your little one a favor and go to a grain free or reduced grain dog food.  When you think about it, wild dogs didn't eat corn meal!  If your little one has allergies, you will be amazed at the immediate healing.

review/text: My AKC English Bulldog has been using greenies since he was a puppy, and hasnt had any problems with it. Ive always given him the correct size greenie for his weight, and have never had to take him to the vet. (yet I never leave him unattended with his greenie) The only problem I had with this particular seller was the picture on display, and what I recieved in the mail. Please don't make the same mistake I did, there are only 17 greenies in the box, would have been better off buying them at Petsmart.

Product shipped extremely quick even using the super saver shipping. My dog absolutely loves these treats. She hates going to her crate, but if I grab one of these out of the box that it came in, show it to her, and say "bed" she literally sprints to her crate in anticipation. Highly Recommended. Oh and her breath is about half as stinky as it was before I started giving her these.

review/summary: Great for my old, spoiled dog
review/text: My elderly (soon-to-be 17) beagle, Dakota, is super picky about what he eats.  Making a different dish (has to have different protein source and flavoring) every other night is the only way I can keep weight on this once food-frenzied chow hound.  The ONLY consistent item he eats -- including dog treats and human table food -- are Greenies treats.  The "Senior" variety is the perfect texture (softer than the regular Greenies treats) for his aging, sensitive teeth.  The inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin to help with his joints give me hope that it helps the creaking and cracking of his joints.  Whatever the formula they use to make it easier to digest is a plus since I know his aging system doesn't work as well in his older years.  Dakota gets one petite Greenies Senior treat everyday and he has never turned down an offer for one yet.

review/summary: WORMS IN GREENIES?????
review/text: This is my second box of greenies that I have been quite pleased up until today.  I pull out on greenie and found a WORM along with larvae!! This is horrible.  I had this box for 3 months.  I emptied the box and found about a dozen more worms and was disgusted.  I couldn't believe greenies product was contaminating my dogs.  The expiration date is dated 2013 so this clearly shows that there is something wrong with this product.  I hope someone from the greenies department will give contact me to fix this.  I will be posting these comments on every doggy treat review forum/website until I hear from someone so I know that they are trying to fix it and shows how much they value their customers and product.  I don't know how long I have been feeding greenies with worms in them so my two pups will now have to go to the vet.

review/summary: Observe Pet Reactions to Greenies
review/text: I had good results with this product six months ago.  However, a second purchase that I just opened caused all of my three dogs to vomit within minutes of eating the product.  I removed other items from their diet to be sure and it did it again, instantly. I contacted the company about it and they have claimed no other problems exist(suggesting I must have tainted the product or have exposed it to an environment making the dog snacks unstable, or the company I purchased them from somehow did something to the product. Hmm: sounds troubling to me, especially from the factory.). I have seen other issues out there regarding this product, which vary.  Use your own methods of making a control group, but be sure to see they have proper bowel movements and are not vomiting after you feed them the product.  Secondly, Greenies.com(the Nutro Company) will not honor purchases made through unauthorized vendors.  Amazon directly is an "authorized vendor".  "Monster Pets" is not authorized to resell these items and only those vendors listed on their website are "authorized".  They will only help you return/refund something if it was purchased through an "authorized" vendor.  This now makes me leery of items purchased through "Amazon Marketplace", particularly food items.  Buyer beware!  Caveat emptor!

review/text: My dog won't eat these things. I can offer her nothing else to eat all day and she still will literally turn her back and walk away from these things. I tried gifting them to another small dog owner, only to find they are warned against as a choking hazard. Turns out they are so gummy that they sometimes get stuck in a dog's throat and choke the poor thing to death. Maybe my dog knew something I didn't... or maybe they just don't taste or smell that good to some dogs. Buyer beware. (Message me if you want an almost full 96 count box for just the cost of shipping, since if you are going to buy them, I hate to throw away something someone else can use.)

review/summary: These scare me.  Look at what I've found online:
review/text: I was all set to buy these thinking they'd be great for my dog.  Then I found:<br /><br />"At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top-selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died."<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. "Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog," the directions say.<br /><br />Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  "These things tend to be wolfed down," said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. "They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2-year-old. Dogs can't be controlled that way."  [...]<br /><br />Even though the info from these links may be BEFORE they improved them, and considering the following quote:  "At the end of the day ... literally millions of Greenies are enjoyed by dogs on a weekly basis with absolutely no incidents,"<br />[...]<br /><br />I'm still extremely leary.

review/text: I expected to recieve a box of Greenies, which is why I ordered this.  I thought that it would be a nice and neat way to store them.  Instead what I recieved was a bubble bag full of individually wrapped greenies.  Not neat and easily stored at all.  The picture of this item shows a box, but I did not recieve a box of greenies.  I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored.  My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.  My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described.  Maybe they ran out and just threw 45 individually wrapped greenies in a bubble mailer, either way, that was disappointing.

review/summary: I don't recommend this treat for your dog.
review/text: From a taste perspective, your dog will probably love this product; however, I do not recommend that you buy it for your dog.  As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them.

review/text: I'm a fan of Greenies for dogs. However, this size is just too small and almost immediately snap in half. The issue with that is they end up chewing each 1/2 down to a size that is easy to gag and choke on. Part of the advantage to Greenies is that they're supposed to break down to tiny bits that are easily swallowed. These breaking in half defeats the purpose.<br /><br />For puppies and even for grown up tiny dogs I recommend going one size up.

review/text: My dog was on a bland diet (boiled chicken & rice) so his poop was usually solid but a few days after eating 1 Greenie a day, his poop became more liquid-y and green. Not sure if Greenies was actually the cause until I googled and read on various dog forums about how Greenies have affected other dogs. Stopped giving out my dog Greenies and have thrown them away. BEWARE, Greenies CAN be bad, so watch your dog after giving them out.

review/summary: Greenies are not digestible -your puppy will vomit and have diarrhea and will get very sick
review/text: I made the mistake to give a Greeny to my puppy without reading reviews about this product. It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: "a Greenie got stocked in his intestine".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. "Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog.

review/text: Why aren't there more negative reviews on the site?  Greenies are known for the harm they've caused many dogs; just look it up to see for yourself.<br />Years ago, my Pomeranian died due to biting off a chunk of a Greenie bone and having it obstruct her intestine.<br />It was a painful and horrific death and I found out the same thing has happened to many other dogs to the fact that they are full of cellulose fiber.  There are many other types of teeth-cleaning bones out there that WON'T seriously injure your dogs.  They're probably cheaper as well.

review/summary: Be careful with wheat gluten
review/text: I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as "gluten intolerance"in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies.

review/summary: Find another treat
review/text: I have an almost two year old lab mix named Ares. I willingly admit to spoiling him and didnt mind getting him these over priced treats. His vet told us that his joints were in need of attention so I took it upon myself to buy Greenies treats that support joint care for large dogs. I started with a small bag to see if he liked them which he did. He was in love with them. I noticed he had a bit more gas than usual coupled with some less solid poop, but I didnt really read to much into it. After giving him these treats he farted almost constantly! He also had diarrhea on a regular basis.Within a week of feeding him these on a regular basis he would stay in the squatting poop position for about three to five minutes every time he pooped trying to get more out. Once he got to the point that he was leaking diarrhea onto my floor it hit me. I called his vet who advised me to discontinue use of this horrid product. After which I looked up reviews and was horrified at what I read. This stuff is posion. Its killing dogs and cats. DONT LOSE YOUR BEST FRIEND OR WASTE YOUR MONEY! Find a better product. Your best friend deserves it.

review/summary: Greenies Made My Dog SICK
review/text: Do not buy these for your dog! I made the mistake of not researching Greenies Dental Chews online before buying these. If you Google the Greenies and how sick it may make your dog you will be shocked these are still on the market. Dogs have died eating this deadly poisonous treat.<br /><br />I saw the reviews on this product and I bought the teenies for my Yorkshire Terrier and gave it to him at night after his dinner. I figured since its for 5-15 lb dogs and his first time, I'll give him just half of the teenie. The next morning he didn't eat and he threw up bile and some of the food he ate from the night before. And remember I only gave him 1/2 a piece; imagine if I gave him an entire piece, it might get obstructed in his intestines.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and they wanted to send me a replacement. Seriously? Like after all that for making my dog sick, you think that I should try it again? Plus they wanted the Greenies back. For what? To resell this poison? They wouldn't even mail me a box to return it. Eventually they just decided to send me a refund and that I can discard the Greenies.<br /><br />I just want to warn pet owners of this danger. There are plenty of similar complaints on this product if you research online. Please take care of your pets!

review/summary: The Ultimate Consumer "Fraud."
review/text: We have two St. Bernards, one of whom is close to ancient, and last year she developed a dental problem.  Someone mentioned GREENIES and off we went to find our old girl something to help her age gracefully and hopefully without pain.  Well, she just loved them - as did the younger Saint - and here we are a couple of thousand dollars later wondering how to wean at least the younger dog off these obviously addictive green hard gel bones that don't have a single expensive ingredient in them.  The packaging, however, is nicer than that of most department stores but just how many of those boxes do I really want?<br /><br />I have calculated that the most expensive dentist around here would have cost less than the dent Greenies have made in my pocketbook.  So this is a warning to first time browsers - move on to another product that might well do the job for a third of the money.  A stop at your local butcher's shop could be cost saving compared to these overpriced pieces of strange green.  Someone should tell these folks that we are inching toward a depression because to date their reaction to what must be declining sales is to just keep upping the price.

review/summary: Greenies are the Best
review/text: My dogs get more excited over Greenies than any other treat.  I have one German Shorthair that is a notoriously finicky eater, and she has flat-out refused many varieties of dental bones.  Not only do the Greenies do a great job of keeping her teeth clean, but she practically does back flips when it's time for her daily chew.<br /><br />I have pointers between 45 and 60 pounds, and the regular size is great for them.  Greenies are not a chew that will last very long (usually about 30 seconds with my dogs) - but they do the job.  The chew's consistency is just right for a dental bone.  I give one to each dog after their evening meal, and afterwards there is no food residue left on their teeth.<br /><br />Dental bones aren't the kind of treats that I use frequently or for training.  I give 1 per day to help with oral hygiene.  Based on that use of this product I have yet to find anything that compete with Greenies.

review/text: I thought I would write a review because I have seen some negative ones out there. In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them.

I was giving these to my dog for a few days, her breath was great and I felt good that her teeth were also being cleaned aside from brushing. I noticed she was getting diarrhea didnt really think it was the greenies until I did research and found alot of dogs have digestive issues over this stuff and some small dogs have even died. My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back. She had it all day yesterday and some this morning, hopefully tomorrow it is all gone but these greenies are now in the garbage and I am in search of other dental chews.

review/summary: My dogs love Greenies!
review/text: My dogs get one greenie everyday.  I like that they offer a lite version.  I was giving them the teenie version that has 96 greenies which took less than 1 minute to consume.  Since they are 14 lbs and 19 lbs, I'm happy that they offer the petite size which takes them a couple minutes to consume.

review/text: Bentley LOVES Greenies!  He has a lot of tartar and he is only 2 1/2 so we use them hoping it helps.  He gets one every night if he has finished all his food.  He will go to the closet and cry if I forget.  All I have to say is "puppy crack"  and he goes crazy for it!  It seems to be helping, but I can't really tell but we will continue using it always.  I priced them several places and Amazon was the best deal.

review/text: All my dogs have absolutely loved Greenies, though my latest little guy tends to gain weight in the winter, hence Greenies Lite!  This is the treat that my dogs will literally DANCE for, so when I can find these tubs for a great price, I grab them!  They really do prevent stinky breath and keep his six-year old doggy teeth looking good.  This was a "home-run" hit under the Christmas tree!

review/summary: My dogs go crazy for these
review/text: Heaven forbid that I should run out of these, so I usually order more than one box at the time. My dogs are small, so I always buy the LITE Teenie Greenies. My dogs love these so much they will do anything I ask them to do just to get one. They will come to me when I call them, no matter where they are, if they think they'll get a greenie reward. I give each one of my two little dogs a greenie everynight before their bedtime, and they know the routine so well till one of them runs to her bed and actually opens up her kennel door with her paws, then climbs in and waits for her greenie. I have never seen a dog yet who did not love greenies.  Even my almost toothless fourteen year old schnauzer loves her some greenies.

review/text: Greenies are a great product that dogs love and while they are enjoying their daily treat, they are actually keeping their teeth  and gums clean.  I always share the information on Greenies when people ask how I keep my 6 year old Yellow Labradors teeth so clean.  I'd always thought they were a bit expensive but Amazon has brought them to us at a more affordable price.  We have chosen the lite variety to keep our lab a bit trimmer in weight.  A good product at a reasonable price....Thanks

It is one of the few treats I can safely offer my smallest yorkie. They both seem to listen very well when I pull out the bag.<br /><br />My vet says that for yorkies they both have very little plague. It beats trying to use the small brushes to brush their teeth.

review/summary: Forewarning you may get old version
review/text: Since 2006 I've been purchasing several flavors of Wolfgang's organic soups from Amazon. Wolfgang has apparently by the label picture, re-vamped his old green label soup products particularly the black bean soup. The green label black bean soup I received yesterday was the old plain black bean version. This was not what I wanted nor expected. I wanted the new version with the corn, tomatoes, green peppers, etc. as depicted on the new label. After Amazon could not guarantee that I would receive a replacement item of the new version, they provided a refund. Customer Service was unable to ascertain when the new version would be in stock. So now I will wait to reorder until I read a review that says they received the one w/ the corn etc. in it. Although this old version of black bean tastes okay,(I spice it up a bit and add either sour cream or cheddar cheese), I still have 5 cans left over from my winter purchase and did not want more of the same. I wanted a soup I did not taste the need to add ingredients to it. BTW if you get the old chicken noodle or chicken rice versions they are great w/o additional ingredients.

review/summary: For the Garlic Lover
review/text: I've recently become a devotee of extra virgin olive oil, and I originally purchased a bottle of this product at Costco, apparently during a "preview" period. I am very fussy about having olive oil and garlic on my pasta, and when I saw that this product had garlic already in it, I could not ignore the urge to try it.  I am so happy that I purchased this product because it meets my expectations of the flavor I've been looking for -- a delightfully light oil flavor with just enough garlic flavor to keep my tastebuds super happy. After I finished the first bottle that I bought at Costco, I went back to get more, but Costco no longer stocked it.  I discovered I could order it online through Amazon, and I ordered 2 more bottles . . . one of which I gave to my daughter who is a very discerning cook . . . and she also loves it!!  When the time comes to get more, I will be sure to order more through Amazon!! I hope that this product will be around as long as I am!!!!

review/text: I really like this marinade. My Jamaican parents use the walkerswood jerk rub as a starting point for their jerk marinade at home. I was actually looking for that product on amazon and found this marinade instead. And I decided to give it a try. As a student, I do not have the time to make an authentic Jamaican Jerk Sauce on my own  (nor do I really have the know-how) but this marinade tasted really good.<br /><br />I am often very disappointed by pre-prepared jerk sauces. They are either too sweet or too spicy but this was perfect as a quick and easy alternative to the what I have at home. I baked my jerk chicken and used the leftover fluids in the dish as gravy for my rice and peas. It was perfect and filling!<br /><br />While I'll always prefer my parents' jerk sauce, I'll continue to use this sauce when I can't get home to my parents' house for dinner.

review/summary: best jerk seasoning
review/text: I have been visiting Jamaica for 15 years now and stock up on this mariande every trip.  When I ran out and found it on amazaon I was excited.  It truly is the best.....I am known for making the best chicken around.  I top salmon with it, grill the salmon with the skin on, then serve it with a sweet mango cutney...so good.

review/summary: As authentic as you'd want it!
review/text: I went to Jamaica a few years ago and Walkerwoods Traditional Jerk Seasoning was the brand sold in the gift shop of the resort I stayed at.  The only brand sold in the gift shop because it is considered the best!  I bought a jar or two and took it home.  Since then I have been searching for a local supplier and have been sadly disappointed.  This stuff is AWESOME!  So flavorful with just the right kick!  I highly recommend this product to anybody who wants an authentic jerk experience, short of going to Jamaica, Mon!!!
