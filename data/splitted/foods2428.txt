review/summary: Sahale strikes again!
review/text: I love it. They both taste AWSOME. The cranberry sesame mix is slightly salty and the cherry apple mix is more on the sweeter side. I am a BIG FAN of SAHALE SNACKS. i find them to be tastey and nutritious. They are great to keep in your bag for work or play. They are great for a long car drive and a fun snack to give away. I understand there is sort of a cult following with Sahale, so I loke to give them away to people to spread the word.

review/text: I love this product. There is nothing better with a little cream in a cup of coffee, or over fresh berries. However, the packaging for shipping was a joke. One of those thin mailer envelopes, not manila, but probably thinner, no padding; no packing material. No invoice. When I pulled it out of the mail box, the envelope was worn (not torn, WORN) open and the bottle fell right out. After paying that much for shipping, I was not pleased. At least the bottles are plastic now, and this did not break. Would order the syrup again in a heart-beat, but not from this seller.

review/summary: Nice and chocolatey, but alas, not a true brownie....
review/text: This is a very good mix overall.  I cook it for the 18 minutes recommended time and the edges of the mix are quite cakey, and the inner part is moist and tender, but does not really have the texture of a brownie.  My kids, raised milk and egg free, don't know the difference and happily consume this product, as do other kids who come to our home.<br /><br />I, however, miss brownies very much and was hoping to have found a product that really recreated that Brownie taste and texture.  The real barrier to doing so is the lack of a good egg substitute that binds and leavens just like a real egg.  The 1 tsp baking powder + 1.5 TBS water + 1.5 TBS oil is best used for recipes that call for just 1 egg, although I can get away with two egg recipes sometimes.  But since most of my favorite Brownie recipes call for 3-4 eggs, I have just forgone brownies.<br /><br />In conclusion, nice taste, worth purchasing and making, but don't expect a true brownie.<br /><br />p.s.  If you need a dairy-free butter substitute, I highly, highly recommend Organic Smart Balance margarine - it comes the closest of any substitute to the flavor and mouth-feel of real butter.  And it is excellent for cooking.

review/text: Our grandson is allergic to dairy and we have searched for good dairy free products. We found the Cherrybrook Kitchen Fudge Brownies to be very tasty. The Cherrybrook Kitchen packaged foods are all excellent. In fact our whole family prefers them to any other brand, non-allergenic or not. Have also had their chocolate chip cookies which are excellent also. We highly recommend them and Amazon does a great job of bringing them to your doorstep with no hassle at a good price!

review/summary: WOW!  Super easy and tastes great!
review/text: I have made these several times now.  First two boxes were made using extra virgin light oilve oil since that is what I had, no butter.  I baked them in a glass dish and then in a round metal cake pan.  I had to bake them for almost 22-25 minutes both times.  Both came out like chocolate cake.  Great tasting but not the texture I was looking for. Next time I used the butter and made them in my aluminum round cake pan.  Better with the butter versus the oil.  Still really cake like and I only baked them that time for 20 minutes.  Today I used the same metal pan, butter and only baked them for 17 minutes.  They cooled for several hours before we ate some.  Almost perfect!  I think I might add 1 more minute next time to get a little more firmness in the middle.  I think the problem is that the center totally jiggles when you take them out at 16 or 17 minutes.  I thought they were not done on my prior attempts.  I figured since they had no egg I would go for it at that time and am glad I did.  You must let them cool I think cause they would be too gooey if you ate them warm.  The edges were cake like but the center was fudge "y".  Let's just say I will be making these many times!  I am set up on the subscribe option.  I do add nuts too.  Thanks for the peanut free goodness!  We also love the pancake mix too.

Pretty high praise!!!<br /><br />Thanks again, Cherrybrook Kitchen--your brownies and whole-wheat pancakes are life-savers--literally!!!! And tasty, to boot!

review/text: I had high expectations for this spicy chicken noodle meal by Nissin...not any more. The noodles were perfectly fine. It's the spices that were the deal-breaker. It wasn't too spicy hot, just loaded up with a 'strange' spice...perhaps cumin or curry. This dish tasted more Indian or Pakistani, than Oriental. It came with no-less-than four separate flavor packets. Through some trial-and-error sleuthing, I might be able to pinpoint the offending culprit. I'll keep you posted. 'Til then: "Caveat Emptor".

review/text: First of all, this noodle is NOT spicy at all. Even after adding the entire pack of the spice into the bowl, I didn't feel the "spicy" sensation in my mouth.<br /><br />BUT... that is not the reason why I am giving this product a 1-star rating. The reason is that the product is actually quite salty. Of course one can always adjust the amount of spice that he/she adds into the bowl but the name of this product is "Spicy Chicken" , not "Salty Chicken".<br /><br />Aside from it not being spicy but quite salty, there is also quite a bit of curry flavor in it. I am a big fan of curry...but I like the "real" freshly made curry that requires at least one whole day of prep time. The artificial curry flavor, plus the saltiness, PLUS it not being spicy, prompts me to give this product a low rating.<br /><br />Come to think of it, actually, there are also 2 other reasons behind my 1-star rating aside from the taste. (1) Amazon doesn't have a rating system that goes below 1-star... and (2) If/when I am about to starve to death with less than 10 cents left in my bank accounts and this is the only food available in my house ( NOT even any dog or cat food left), would I go for this noodle? Heck Yeah...

I am a connoisseur and this really is terrific, one of the best of any marmalade and certainly by far and away the best blood-orange variant on the market.<br /><br />The lack of the fifth star is NOT a comment on the quality of the product but on the company's hidden shipping costs. The charges are well above average and well above actual cost if you only buy a few jars. Even if you buy five jars, the most you can get against a $15 shipping fee, please note that actual UPS Ground shipping costs was really $9.95--or so the UPS web site told me. I sort of wish these people wouldn't hide fees this way--it demeans the product.

review/summary: No salt Ketchup at last!
review/text: For someone who doesn't/can't have a lot of sodium, this was a great find. Now the whole house is using it. I even got my regular grocery store to carry it, for a bit cheaper also. Too bad Heinz doesn't put it in a bigger container. Hopefully it will catch on and make the larger size.<br />It tastes EXACTLY like regular Heinz, so why not get the sodium out of this food? We all eat too much salt. Just pay some attention to any packaged dinner or canned food (even vegetables).<br /><br />I'll never go back to 'regular' ketchup!

review/summary: delicious ketchup
review/text: I had been on a restricted diet for months so I had to watch my salt content carefully. I purchased this ketchup and was shocked to taste how good it was. I could not tell the difference. I decided to continue to purchase this low sodium ketchup in my normal diet.<br />highly recommended.

review/summary: Like the "real" thing -just much healthier
review/text: I did blind taste tests with members of my family - they had a hard time distinguishing between regular (salted) Heinz ketchup and the salt-free version.  It really tastes great.  Since all processed foods are full of salt, we all tend to consume much more salt than is healthy for us.  Being able to cut out salt without necessarily having to give up on that "great" taste of salted products is wonderful.

review/summary: These are THE originals!
review/text: As a first generation American I have visited family in Ireland for many years. I have always enjoyed Irish sausages daily while there, with Chef's Brown sauce of course, and a cup of Barry's gold tea. The amazing thing is now, thanks to the internet, I can have all three anytime I want. I have ordered Galtee's and Donnelly's before, but no brand, and I truly mean no brand, can compare to Tommy Maloney's. Throw them in a baking pan with a touch of olive oil in a 320' oven, turning frequenty, and you will get the most lovely, perfecty browned and tasty Irish sausage... just like they serve in Ireland. Morning or night, they never disappoint. Add a cup of strong Barry's Gold tea and you'll be transported instantly. Order Tommy Maloney's with confidence.<br />A McGovern from Cavan!

review/summary: Great biscotti, sources harder to find
review/text: Like other reviewers, these are most enjoyable to me.  Until fairly recently, the 1-lb 14-oz container was available at a great price from our local warehouse club.  Today however, only the chocolate flavor and in some stores for the holidays the gingerbread flavor is available.  I do enjoy these but the "Originali" is my runaway favorite.  The sources for the 1-lb 14-oz container show prices 40% higher than the warehouse club, and then you have to add unreasonable shipping amounts.  So the deal now is the 12-pack of boxes of 8 for a total of 96 biscotti at a price rivaling the warehouse club.

review/text: I had these Biscotti on vacation and really enjoyed them.  So when I saw them on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to buy them again at a good price.  While the Biscotti were very tasty, they were somewhat stale and not as crunchy as I remember from vacation.  Also, I noticed the expiration date was two months away from when I purchased them.  I don't know what the expiration dates are on those in the local grocery store but I wondered if these were excess Biscotti and that is why they were inexpensive.

review/text: I've just bought this biscotti at Walmart for $2.88 an 8-pack. Wonderful flavor! Chocolate flavor, with more chocolate on the bottom, deliciously crisp, and has a nice almond flavor, too.<br />However, if you buy 12 pack at Walmart it comes to $34.56, so the price here is not that great. I just don't like when they put a price here, then cross it and make you believe there's a deal you are getting.

review/summary: Nonni's Toffee Almond & Lemon Biscottis
review/text: great product; unfortunately shipping took a toll on the biscotti's (majority arrived in crumbs & broken pieces). Have since ordered an additional 8 boxes. The lemon ones were shipped in a second Amazon box which seemed to provide some additional protective, as only a few were broken in some of the boxes. Would recommend seller in the future ship all 12 pack boxes in a second box and add extra cushioning protection. It would allow folks to dunk their biscotti's rather than have to eat direct from the wrapper and get crumbs everywhere.

review/text: This is a wonderful snack to have whenever you have a craving for something to munch.  Each box contains 8 individually wrapped biscotti.  I normally don't like biscotti, finding it too hard on my teeth and too boring for my taste.  This brand's biscotti, however, has the perfect combination of sweetness, crunchiness, and chocolaty goodness!  It's made from Kosher ingredients and 100% trans fat free.  I bought a case (pack of 12) so I can share them with my family and friends.  Highly recommended!

Not the tough biscotti that has to soak for 10 min. before it can be eaten, these are easy to eat like a cookie, or quickly absorb your hot beverage.  My Japanese exchange student loved these, and when she returned with some to her home in Nagano, her mother wanted more!  So I purchased a case of my own and have sent her a couple of 8-count boxes as a present.  I have been unable to find them in the local grocery stores like I used to.  Other flavors are still available in stores, but not my beloved limon!  But they can be ordered!

review/summary: Lemon flavored cookies - YUM!
review/text: I found the lemon flavored Nonni's Biscotti at my local grocery store,in the deli section.<br />The other flavored cookies did not appeal to me. They were too heavy and hard. These<br />lemon flavored ones are great dunked in my hot tea. I usually have 2 a day and greatly<br />savor them as I work at my computer. I try and enjoy these treats five times a week.<br />By the way, they quit handling my Limone Biscotti at my store and I went looking for<br />a new source and found it thru Amazon.com. Many thanks for your service and prompt<br />filling of my orders.

review/summary: Nonni's Biscotti - Cioccolati
review/text: These are high quality biscotti that you come to expect from a brand like Nonni's.  There are no disappointments to be found with this product.  The tastes is fresh and the bittersweet chocolate is to die for.  I even love the anise seeds.  This pairs well with P&G tips tea or any of your favorite Keurig coffees.  None of my biscotti have been broken and I am on my second box.

review/summary: Not a fan of biscotti in general, but Nonni's get two thumbs up!
review/text: I am not normally a fan of biscotti. Typically, they involve a stale cookie with too much crumble, too much poor quality dark chocolate, and not enough taste...This one however, is different! Let me start with the price: on Amazon I paid 40% less (!!!) with free delivery, then in my grocery store! Hurray! Other then that, why Nonni's?<br /><br />1) They are not as dry and crumbly as other biscotti I have tried over the years. The toffee adds a bit of moisture without being gooey. They are gentler on my teeth, but still with enough cruch to make one biscotti a satisfying snack (at 110 calories), and allow for dunking.<br /><br />2) Individually wrapped, they keep fresh and moist (as moist as a bicotti can possibly be...) for quite a long while. It is good to have an extra box or two for unexpected guests.<br /><br />3) MILK chocolate!!! (I HATE dark chocolate...I'd rather eat spinach...but that is what most biscotti are covered in). There is just enough of it to give you a taste without making you feel you are eating a chocolate bar!<br /><br />ENJOY!

review/summary: A good coffeebreak snack
review/text: This product is a superior light biscotti, crunchy without being hard, and with a light coating of chocolate.  The texture is good, and the flavor is good.  Each piece is 110 calories.  It makes a good snack for a mid-afternoon break, or can be added into a brown bag lunch.  The chocolate coating is heat sensitive, and I would recommend against shipping it in hot weather.

review/text: First, I love Nonni's..I buy the chocolate and plain ones all the time, but never saw the Limone. The order arrived and I noticed a somewhat musty smell on opening and then noticed the expiration date on the boxes is just 8 weeks off. The biscotti in the store are much fresher. Also found one box with a wierd mound of dried glue on the box with dirt and hair imbedded in the glue. I managed to forget the above and enjoy the biscotti...I tossed the box with glue mound. At least I hope it was glue.

I have had trouble lately, finding the original, my favorite, in the grocery or warehouse stores, so ordering by the case, was especially a convenience.

review/text: THESE ARE VERY GOOD BISCOTTI! I'VE ORDERED 4 BOXES OF 12 IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS. THEY WERE NICE TO GIVE AS GIFTS. THEY WERE GOOD TO BRING TO SOMEONES HOUSE FOR DESSERT. THE CHOCOLATE DECADENCE AND THE ONES WITH THE TOFFEE BITS AND ALMONDS ARE VERY GOOD. THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS THE SHIPPING AND HANDLING COST. IF I DID NOT GET THE FREE SHIPPING AND HANDLING; I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THEM. THEY'RE GOOD; BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO SPEND AN EXTRA $20 TO DELIVER.

review/summary: Not just for Halloween anymore!
review/text: There's an orange version of the Kit Kat they sell around Halloween and they are my favorite, they use white chocolate specifically so the food coloring they color the chocolate with shows up orange. Being a white chocolate lover I bought them because of the fact they were made of white chocolate, the fact that they were orange was also kind of interesting but I didn't really care either way I just loved that taste, and I would stock up every Halloween, I would buy like 6-10 bags and then eat it as a special treat throughout the year because they typically expired the next year in November. This year I couldn't find them so I tried the white chocolate Reese's peanut butter cups and was disappointed, a few weeks later I found out these are right next to the checkouts in most stores that sell candy bars by the checkout counter the only difference is there not orange and they come in a bar instead of a bag of individually wrapped mini treats, so when I found out you can buy white chocolate bars in full sized bars I stocked up, I also found out they sell them in bigger packages. The thing that stops me from buying them from here is that the value on here could be better, I found out I can buy 6 packs for $3.94 (about 66 cents a bar.) Where I buy them it would be $15.76 for 4 of the 6 bar packs.

review/text: The product was okay, but only 2 of the 6 boxes were something I couldn't get for cheap at the local grocery. You'd think for such a steep price it would have a more interesting selection. There wasn't even any Pretz in this "Pocky AND Pretz" gift box. It's pathetic. I got 3 slightly different versions of chocolate, 2 slightly different versions of strawberry, and almond crush. Maybe it's just luck of the draw. I wouldn't buy again though.

I was discussing one of the flavors with my friend and apparently they had given her another flavor.
