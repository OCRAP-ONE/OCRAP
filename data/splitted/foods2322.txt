review/summary: My cats love this Venison & Fish Ziwipeak
review/text: I've researched the ingredients and I think this is a high quality, clean product. But it's better for the cats if you add water to it, as even a vet on their website mentions. High-protein dry food is too dehydrating otherwise (all dry food wears on kidneys and urinary system).

review/summary: High quality cat food that my cats love!
review/text: I have three cats, one of which has IBS/digestive issues.  My vets recommended that I switch him to a food with the fewest ingredients as possible and that has an unusual protein (like lamb or venison).  I can get both of those with Ziwipeak!  And all three of my cats love it, which was a real surprise to me.  It took some getting used to since the jerky-style pellets are very different from feeding regular dry food.  But my cats adapted relatively quickly.  All three seem to be thriving on it.  I'm very happy to have found this food.

review/summary: KiwiPeak Lamb
review/text: I have two very picky cats. One has serious food allergy issues, so I've been trying out new foods. My cat with allergies LOVES this food, and it fortunately does not make him sick. The other cat, unfortunately will barely touch this food. He seems to like the smell, but he's really a dry crunchy food addict. The texture of this food is a bit odd. It comes in small flat squares that are dry, but a bit more like jerky than normal dry cat food (not tough like jerky, that's just the closest thing I can compare it to. I suppose you could even compare it to a chopped fruit roll up, made with meat puree instead of fruit). This food wasn't a complete winner for us, but it works for one cat at least.

review/text: After receiving the package I was hoping my three cats would eat it and get healthier. Well none of them would even look at it. Not even hungry stray cats that live outside of my house would even touch it. For the fairness of all consumers that are interested in this product. I will write out the whole sentence that appears on the back of the package and what has been crossed out. "Look for Ziwipeak  'Cuisine' in convenient pouches and easy-tab cans and Ziwipeak treats and supplements at leading natural pet stocklists. The Ziwkpeak 'Cuisine' range is produced in NZMAF-licensed 'PET FOOD' factory &lt;cross out begins> using ingredients derived from animals that have been passed as fit for human consumption in their raw state. &lt;Cross out ends>" I do not care whatever excuse Ziwipeak may present but this non-human grade food is not what I am willing to spend extra money for health of my cats. I have wasted money and I have no way of returning it.

review/summary: It's Okay
review/text: Usually, I buy store brand macaroni and cheese but these were going to be roughly the same unit price.  I thought that the brand name item would be better than the generic, so I bought a pack of six.  Honestly, the generic is better.  The cheese sauce in the Kraft is not as creamy, and it doesn't have as strong of a cheese taste.  It seems like there is just enough cheese sauce to barely cover the noodles even though I squeezed as much out of the package as I could.  Overall, it's okay and we'll eat what we bought, but I'm sticking to the generic when I need to buy more.

review/summary: Shockingly Terrable.
review/text: I should begin by stating that I LOVE the traditional Kraft Macaroni and cheese with the packet of orange powder, but I wanted to try something different and this was on sale.<br /><br />It might not be healthy, but when I want healthy I also plan to spend more than $1 for dinner. When I grab a box of mac a cheese I want buttery, oily, creamy comfort food. When made right it can be a quick and delicious dinner.<br /><br />Let me tell you, every part of the process involving this "deluxe" version was disgusting.<br /><br />While squeezing the sickeningly dark orange cheese paste into the pot onto my cooked noodles, I could only wonder what the next step was to make this appetizing. Unfortunately there was none, you heat up the noodles, add the paste, and stir.<br /><br />It tasted even worse than it looked, very chemical, very chalky taste. For a second it reminded me of the terrible Mac and Cheese I used to get in elementary school, only to realize I was wishing for that over what I had on my spoon. I added some milk and butter in a desperate attempt to give the meal any semblance of edibleness, to no avail.<br /><br />I not only threw the rest out, I threw out the other two boxes I had bought. I hated it so much I made a point to write this review.<br /><br />...This is the only review I have ever written. Simply disgusting.

review/summary: Surely this was a bad batch...
review/text: During the big $25 Kraft promotion, I bought this to have something in the house for when my niece visits... kids like Kraft mac and cheese, aunties would prefer to serve something a little healthier. So I figured with the price incentive, this was an OK compromise. I'd tried it before, and it was fine. And I do love me some mac and cheese (even this lowfat version) in my weaker moments.<br /><br />Well, not this time. One of the boxes was kind of crushed in shipment and the macaroni was spilling out, so I thought "what the hey, I'll just make it for dinner." Ugh! Big mistake! Utterly disgusting. Unlike the reviewer who said the cheese sauce barely registered, I found it to be completely overpowering, and it had a horribly bitter chemical taste. I practically had to choke it down, and eventually I just gave up and threw it out. I have no idea if all the remaining 5 boxes will be just as bad, and I'm afraid to find out. I hope others who purchased this product at the same time will weigh in with their experiences.<br /><br />I'll definitely be sticking with Annie's. Wish I'd noticed that promotion before the Kraft one.

review/summary: Cheap & convenient way to get in bulk.
review/text: I have been buying the 2& milk Kraft mac & cheese for the last year. I basically got it here because it's cheaper when you order it with Amazon's Subscribe & Save, and also convenient to get in bulk. I'll admit I was a little apprehensive about ordering food products in bulk from Amazon, though fortunately this order went very well. The package came really quick; boxes were all intact - nothing smashed, dented or opened; and none were past their expiration dates. Very pleased. Just hope Amazon offers more Grocery products with their Subscribe & Save. Makes it a lot easier to get stuff in bulk and and really nice too when it is actually cheaper than some of my local grcoery markets.

review/summary: Really crispy and really delicious. This seller's shipping is high.
review/text: These are great snacks for cheese lovers and low-carbers and gluten-avoiders. Very crispy and taste really good. Because it's got that strong cheesiness (well, it's pretty much CHEESE hahaha), it satisfies with fewer crisps than if you had, say, potato chips or crackers. No doubt!<br /><br />A serving size of 3 crisps is quite generous and satisfying.<br /><br />I do think the shipping from this seller (Mondo) is too high. If Amazon offers it with S&Save, get it that way or get it from Netrition (less shipping, reliable). I've ordered lots of these since I found them last year. Hubby and I enjoy them and it's part of our snack rotation. The regular parmesan ones are consistently high quality. The Everything ones (which can also be tasty) are more variable. I tend to recommend the plain ones for that reason.<br /><br />Enjoy...

review/text: Honeysuckle Pear is one of three flavors of Drink Chia. I personally like the Strawberry and Mango more, but this one still tastes good. Some of my friends like this one more than the others. They only have 40 calories and 4 grams of sugar, and contain lots of Omega 3 (880mg!!), Omega 6, iron, potassium, calcium, fiber, protein, magnesium...they are extremely healthy.  This is all from the chia seeds you can see inside, which gives it a texture that is new and fun to drink. The seeds themselves absorb more than ten times their weight in water, so when you drink them they hold onto it, keeping you hydrated longer. Great for workouts and sports. It's all in an 8oz bottle so it's easy to carry in a bag or in your hand wherever you go.

review/text: This is the strawberry-citrus flavor of the Drink Chia line and it tastes great. Some chia drinks are thick and almost smoothie-like, but Drink Chia is as light as tea. Filled with chia seeds, vitamin B, and only having 40 calories and 4g of sugar, this beverage is extremely healthy for you and great for on-the-go nutrition.<br /><br />The seeds add a different texture than most drinks, but the seeds naturally gel and chug down very smoothly. Most of the time I don't even notice them. It's the seeds themselves that lock in their sugar and water until you ingest them, and then slowly release them for sustained endurance and hydration. They are loaded with fiber, calcium, protein, magnesium, and more. Just look up chia seeds and you'll see for yourself.<br /><br />If you have a choice between those insanely sugary drinks and juices, or over-caffeinated beverages, or Drink Chia...go with this one. Your body will thank you for it.

review/summary: Drink Chia! Awesome post-run drink!
review/text: Drink Chia! Strawberry Citrus is my post-run drink of choice! It is refreshing, nutritious, and contains the perfect amount of sugar for recovering from a long run. And it's great to get a good dose of anti-oxidants on board too! Try it, you'll like it too!

review/text: Drink Chia is super yummy. Not only do I love it, but my little nephews love it too. It is great that this drink is attractive not only to adults, but to kids as well. This drink is so good for you, and I love all three flavors that they have. I live in Orlando so I've had the Honeysuckle Pear and the Mango Tangerine which I've purchased at Chamberlins and Fresh Market. I'm glad that more people will be able to enjoy this tasty and healthy drink via Amazon. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Favorite Superfood Drink - love Chia seeds
review/text: This is my favorite flavor. I drink it in the morning and usually after a workout. great for hydration, love the seeds, makes me feel full, leaves me feeling more energized, and it is Fun to drink. The taste is great, i love that it is only 40 calories and low in sugar. If I am hungry it gives me a feeling of being full until I have time to get something to eat. Omega 3 is important to me to combat inflammation, so this is a great source for me. Also, there are other great benefits to this drink, high fiber content, antioxidants...i recommended it to anyone looking for a healthy tasty alternative to what is market.

Over the holidays I was slacking on my workouts, so when I finally got back to the gym, I was concerned I wouldn't be able to keep up in spinning class.  I drank a Mango Tangerine Drink Chia! 30 minutes before spin class, and I was able to keep up in class. I could feel my endurance kick in halfway through class, so I know Drink Chia! really helped me.  The Drink Chia! people really make a great product, and I love that they really think about making sure it tastes great.

review/text: At first, the seeds made this drink look unappetizing.  After the first couple of gulps, I got used to the consistency.  I drank one during work and surprisingly didn't feel as hungry as I usually do until after my workout 6 hours later.  So far, it beats out the caffeine drinks as an energy source without the crash.

review/summary: Love the Mango!
review/text: The other flavors of Drink Chia taste great but this is my favorite of the three. It only has 40 calories and 4g of sugar, contains vitamin B, and because of the chia seeds it's loaded with nutrition. It has omega 3, fiber, potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, protein...the list goes on.<br /><br />This is a light drink, not thick like others. The seeds naturally gel in liquid so they also go down smooth, and once ingested the gel slowly releases the sugar and water so you get sustained energy and hydration whether you're running, biking, or working out. Best of all it manages to do all this without caffeine, sodium, or preservatives. All natural. Really remarkable, you gotta try it.

review/summary: Chia seeds have great effect, but taste is awful
review/text: So I will confess, I really feel better and more energized on less sleep when I drink one of these, but this particular brand tastes unbelievably bad.  As if it had aspartame in it, though it does not list it in the ingredients.  I've tried another Chia drink (different brand) and it was lip-smackingly delicious, so I will surely not buy any more of these.  Also, the other brand (found at Whole Foods - I'll update the name when I remember) costs about the same or less for 10oz vs the 8oz of this one.

review/summary: Delicious.
review/text: Robust, flavorful, a little bright, and not bitter at all. One of my favorites.<br /><br />Note: I can't stand all these Starbuck's comparisons in Tassimo t-disc reviews. Starbuck's is clearly a cult, and it has trained its members to enjoy an over-roasted flavor, it has tricked them into thinking over-roasted is "more flavorful," or something. It probably has more to do with economics, with their prevalence everywhere so they're an easy place to go, and henceforth they hook you. Plus, they ramp up the level of caffeine in their coffee, which is always good for feeding addictions.<br /><br />But do yourself a favor and look for a local coffee shop in your area that gets good reviews and try their espresso or even their macchiato (which, you may be surprised to find, is not simply a sweetened latte like Starbuck's makes them). Or even their regular coffee. Maybe slowly, but surely, you'll realize what coffee is supposed to be like.<br /><br />I go on this rant because a majority of reviews for Tassimo coffees consist of "'almost as good as' or even, for those who appreciate good coffee, 'better than' the Starbucks Verona/House Blend/etc. Tassimo disc I can no longer get!"

I'm trying to transition from soda and I love that it doesn't have corn syrup or excess quantities of caffeine beyond the natural tea amounts. So, for a soda drinker, this tastes great.

review/text: I had the extraordinary pleasure to spend a week at Villa Cappelli in Terlizzi, Italy, this past May. The ancient villa on an unpaved section of the Appian Way has been restored by Paul Cappelli. It is a working home with olive groves surrounding the villa. All products are made by Paul and his 'Villa people.' Spices grow in his gardens. Vegetables sit in the Italian sun and are dried by nature. The cellar is filled with the olive oil vats. The lemons from his trees become limoncello. HIs sun-dried tomatoes are in his own EVO and are delicious. His red onion conserve is like none that I've ever had.

review/summary: Delicious and convenient, but other brands taste better and are healthier
review/text: I used this product for many years. I favored them for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. I prefer the vanilla flavors of all the rice beverage milk replacers. It's sweet, if you like that. The small packages are convenient to take along for lunch. The classic flavor is more milk-like than the vanilla or chocolate- but I love those flavors. Other rice beverage brands often don't have a chocolate.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula. In addition, studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink, it tastes more like fresh whole milk straight out of the cow (if you have had that) than what is sold in cartons in the US. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free. I find it to be less sweet, less chalky, and more milk-like in flavor.<br /><br />The same canola issue (as well as sugar) also applies to the Imagine frozen desert products.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications. Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. It's not safe for infants. Check out this small sample of government and peer-reviewed medical journal articles documenting my statements, available online.<br /><br />United States Legislation on Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed Oil, Federal Department of Agriculture, 1985, article 184.1555, sections 3 and 4.<br />Growth Rate, Lipid Composition, Metabolism and Myocardial Lesions of Rats Fed Rapeseed Oils J.

review/summary: Relatively healthy but bland
review/text: As far as spaetzle goes, this is pretty blah. It's just made of flour and spinach, nothing else, so it is low in sugar, salt, and cholesterol-free (no eggs). You can actually taste the spinach, which is nice, and adding salt to the cooking water helps a bit, but the spaetzle is hard and takes forever to boil enough to get it chewy. And then rather than chewy, it gets kind of grainy.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this because of health reasons, but it's so bland I don't think I'll be making it too often. Maybe some egg whites in the ingredients would have helped the texture without adding anything nutritionally poor. I don't know.<br /><br />If you are on a salt-free or cholesterol-free diet, you could probably do worse, but I hope you might be able to do better as well.

review/text: UPDATE:<br />It's been quite a qhile since I ordered my first box of Skin Detox tea, and have ordered it periodically since. I have the awful habit of using skin detox tea until my skin looks great, then not buying the tea for a while until I notice my skin becoming worse.<br />I have to say, that this tea has helped my skin quality in general mroe than any product that I have used. I have at times applied the tea topically as well for stronger effects, but it isn't neccessary for the tea to work. I've decided that i am going to actualyl keep myself in a constant supply of the tea, and drink it each day, as opposed to only after bad breakouts, to take a more proactive rather than reactive approach.<br /><br />Ad for the taste, I actually like it now. it took getting used to, but I find the taste calming and comforting now, as opposed to tolerable before.<br /><br />Anyway, if you have any hesitation whatsoever about tryig this tea for your skin, buy a box at the grocery store to try it out. I can almost guarantee that with regular use, though, your skin will improve.<br /><br />PRIOR REVIEW:<br />My first review, couldnt help myself!<br /><br />I heard some good things about this tea from a friend and decided that it couldnt hurt to order, as i am an avid tea-drinker anyway.<br /><br />Right before the tea arrived I began a horrendous breakout, the worst that I had had in years even. The entire left side of my face was covered in acne, perhaps a reaction from a new face-wash, that i since have been scared to touch!<br />Well a few days following the breakout the tea arrived. I figured there was no better situation really than this to try the tea so over the course of two weeks, besides general rinsing in the shower i have used no face wash, no creams or ointments, nothing. And my acne is almost gone!<br /><br />nothing new has popped up and everything that had been there is almost completely gone, i even notice acne scars fading if possible. my ance is literally drying up, as if i was using some sort of heavy cleanser or astringent, it is quite ridiculous. I am already looking at my budget to see if i have enough to order another batch.<br /><br />I used about 3 bags a day, one cup about midday with two tea bags, and one before bed with a single bag.<br /><br />The tea has a flavor that takes getting used to, both strong and weak at the same time, hard to explain. i don't use sugar so i don't know how it tastes with anything added.<br /><br />either way, it cant hurt so try it, i say!

review/summary: My favorite tea
review/text: First off, I don't think there is anything wrong with the taste of this tea. It has a subtle fruity/berry flavor.  I almost didn't order it because of some of the comments in the reviews.<br /><br />I've been using the Yogi vanilla energy tea in the morning and drinking this after dinner.  I do see a difference in my skin. It is more glowy and I haven't had a breakout since the first week of drinking the tea.  My husband has also commented on my skin so it must be working!!<br /><br />I would recommend this.  I will continue to purchase this even if I didn't get any results because it does taste really good!

review/summary: Makeup Optional Skin
review/text: I have been struggling with hormonal acne for a couple of years now. As an African-American, it leaves dark spots on my face. I tried aaaaallll the acne products out there that just made my skin dry, or would treat the acne, but wld still leave spots. If I tried lightening my spots, then I would breakout...a vicious looping cycle. I recently have been using natural products like African soap and unrefined shea butter which is more cost effective for me which work well, but still needed something to epedite the process. I decided to add THIS tea to my regimine, and I am hooked! I use 5 bags to make a gallon of cold tea to drink throughout the day. The taste was ok at first, but after a week, I noticed that I DONT BREAKOUT ANYMORE! The benefits outweigh the taste. And whats great as well is that my dark spots on my cheeks are getting lighter. My skin just glows, supple, and more even toned. My cleansers and moisturizers work for me instead of against me. I originally bought this at a whole food store, but saw that it was on Amazon, so now I am on autoship - never want to be without. This tea is a game changer for me....on my way to makeup optional skin!

review/text: I bought this tea because I have psoriasis. It seems to work fairly well. It has not gone away completely but I do have less itching and overall it does look much better. The tea is very tasty and has stevia added so it requires very little sweetening if any. I definitely would purchase it again.

review/summary: Happy so far
review/text: I have suffered from severe cystic acne for a few years now. My face is really starting to clear, and I'm seeing the glow that other reviewers have talked about. In the past I have tried eating healthier, taking tons of supplements and using all sorts of ointments, benzoyl peroxide, salycic acid. Nothing cleared my skin. There are several factors here. First I was a heavy coffee drinker and for those that don't know, coffee is very acidic inside your body. Stopping coffee helps, plus all the unneeded cream and sugar in my cup. Sugar and dairy should also be avoided for clearer skin. This tea is naturally sweetened with stevia, I think it's sweet enough by itself. If this tea is not sweet enough for you I would recommend adding extra stevia, or honey. Just avoid using white bleached processed sugar and artificial toxic sweeteners, like Sweet and low, Equal, and Splenda. One other thing, your body will heal itself. Avoid, washing your face more than twice a day and applying<br />lots of products. If you wouldn't eat it don't apply it to your skin, your body absorbs all those chemicals.<br /> I believe that cutting way back on coffee, and replacing your caffeine source to a green tea will have a dramatic affect on your complexion. That being said, the glowing has to be some ingredient in this tea.<br />I have been alternating between Yogi skin detox and Yogi super green antioxidants, for over a week. I haven't broken out<br />badly sense drinking this tea, well one or two pimples,  but they are nowhere near as large and painful as before, they also seem to be healing faster. Hopefully after a few weeks I will start seeing even better results. Also shaving for the past few days has been easier, my skin feels less dry and the razor glides over my face with less irritation.

review/summary: A new face!
review/text: This tea works really great if you allow it to. By that I mean make sure you're also following a cleaner diet so that it can take effect.  I first drank this tea while following a regular diet and noticed my complexion brightening and clearing up.<br />I also tried this tea while on the master cleanse  1-2 bags per day) and I didn't recognize my own skin. It was very clear moist and supple like high school days. Much clearer complexion unnoticeable pores. Perfect.<br />I think clearing my diet and food intake really allowed the tea to do it's work. I also increased my water intake. I normally have dry skin but this tea made my skin look and feel much more moisturized without applying products. I lost the dry dehydrated dark circles around my eyes.<br />Hope to do it again !!!

review/summary: Glowing
review/text: I have been drinking 1-2 cups a day for a couple weeks now, and I have definitely noticed a difference.  My skin has a lustrous glow when clean that I have never seen before.  The taste is quite pleasant, and I am relieved to find that after many cups I am only enjoying it more.  The only reason I give it four stars is because of my probably unrealistic hope that my acne scars would dramatically disappear.  As it is, they are fading slowly but surely.  Maybe the tea has even sped up the process, but it is hard to tell since it is still too slow for me!  In any case, I definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE FOR PROBLEM SKIN!!
review/text: I just have to put my two cents in on this tea... prior to drinking this tea last summer (I drank about 2-3 cups a day), I could not go out in the sun AT ALL! I had to make sure I was completely covered up!  I LOVE the warmth and the sun and for the past three years prior to drinking had to stay away from the sun!  The slightest bit of exposure made me breakout in itchy hives!! It was HORRIBLE!! I was allergic to the sun. I saw this tea in my local Whole foods and decided to give it a try.  I've tried just about EVERYTHING from creams to steriods -- you name it!!<br /><br />This tea changed my LIFE!!! I was able to enjoy summer last year with my children!  We spent a lot of time outdoors, at the pool, and the park, and it was wonderful!!!<br /><br />After I ran out, and my skin was feeling great, I didn't purchase it again, until now... my skin is beginning to get itchy once again with the mild weather that we've been having, so I ordered it from Amazon today! I can't wait to sip my first cup!!!  Thanks Amazon for this great deal!!

review/summary: The ONLY thing that's worked!
review/text: So, I used to have a pretty decent complexion before I passed the threshold into adulthood. I started getting adult acne around my 20th birthday, and while it comes and goes, the only time I've ever seen my skin super clear was with the help of photoshop.<br />Enter Yogi Skin Detox Tea. I drank two cups of this over two days, and I started to see my blemishes disappear, and my skin started to get supple. After a week, my skin was completely clear. I didn't drink it for three days (as my package was at work, and this was over a weekend), and my skin started to breakout again. This is a miracle worker and I don't think I ever want to be without it!

review/summary: Great tasting, relaxing tea
review/text: I love the smell and taste of this tea. It is surprising that it has caffeine in it because I drink it at night before bed and I feel relaxed.<br />I have taken yogi Detox tea before and I can actually see noticeable difference in my skin after taking this tea a couple of times than the (regular) Detox tea.<br />As far as acne goes, I have hormonal acne and all I can say is that this tea did not make it worst. Everybody's body is different and I don't think this alone can eliminate acne for me. I did notice a glow on my skin after taking this tea and the severity of my acne is less. They are not as gigantic and painful as before. I did not have any side effects from the tea.<br /><br />As far as sellers: I first bought one pack from the local health food store for 4.99. After seeing the results within a week (I was and still take it 2-3 times a day) I ordered the 6 boxes from Amazon for 30 bucks (had to pay for shipping). Then after 2 weeks, I found out that it was almost half the price on Amazon and prime shipping. So, I was happy with my second order from Amazon not the first one.<br /><br />overall, It is a good tea and it gives your skin a nice glow and makes it look refreshed. Happy with its effect on acne in making them less bumpy and less painful. Did not eliminate my acne completely but I was not expecting it to do that. I am happy with the result. I will be buying more.

review/summary: Bitter taste. Smells good.
review/text: I trusted the reviews and went ahead and bought the 6 pack. I was curious about the taste of the tea. My first observation was the bitterness of the tea. It tasted bitter and grassy. The stevia root does not seem to help much. I can definitely smell the rose-hips in the tea while it's brewing and it's quite pleasant. I tried several seeping techniques and the only way I managed to reduce the bitterness of this tea is by brining the water to a boil and then letting it cool down at room temperature for a minute before inserting the tea bag and let it steep for just 3 minutes.<br /><br />Since I didn't buy the tea because of it's advertised benefits to the skin, I was not surprised when I didn't observe any change in my skin condition whatsoever. So far, I have been drinking 2 cups a day for the last 4 weeks. If you want to detoxify your body, drink water and eat real food. Tea doesn't really do much if your entire lifestyle is unhealthy. Eat what your grandmother ate.

review/text: I bought this tea at a local health food store and then proceeded to read the reviews online about this tea.<br /><br />The reviews about its tasting bad had me expecting the worst. I think it tastes pretty good! It reminds me of the smell of flowers and outdoors when I visited Thailand. Very relaxing and soothing.<br /><br />I started drinking last Sunday and the little bumps on my chin (no one else can see) dried up and went away and I too notice the dewy glow to my skin.<br /><br />Obviuously, diet and exercise are needed as well. The tea cant just perform miracles on its own.<br /><br />Overall, Im happy with the taste, the smell, and the results so far.<br /><br />Give it a try.

review/summary: Something Finally Works for my Skin!!!!!!!
review/text: First of all, I must admit that this is my very first product review.  Usually, I have never taken the time to provide any type of feedback on products; however, I had to make an exception this time.  I didn't believe skin detox tea would work, even after I read the reviews so I purchased one box of Yogi DeTox tea from a local store since they didn't have the skin detox kind.  Well after drinking it, I noticed a difference the very next day, but it made my stomach hurt.  I just assumed that it was ridding my body of toxins.  About 2 weeks later, I ordered the Skin DeTox tea from Amazon because I couldn't find it anywhere else.  I wish I had taken before and after pictures because the results are amazing.  My skin has not looked this good in years and I have only been drinking this tea for about a month now, two weeks of the detox tea and about 2 weeks of the skin detox tea.  The only reason I took so long to write this review is because I thought that after a few days, my bumps would return.  Well so far so good...I have 2 or 3 bumps on my entire face, but I use to have acne all over my face until I started drinking the skin detox tea.  Everyday, the bumps are getting smaller and smaller.  I use to put all kinds of creams and dermatologist recommended ointments all over my face, but lately I've only been using the Cetaphil antibacterial soap and drinking the skin detox tea every morning.  I use two tea bags a day which makes me one large cup of tea.  I guess it really equates to about two regular size cups of tea a day.  I really pray that it continues to work for me because I'm so happy about the look of my skin and haven't felt so good in years.  Anyway, just order it and try it.  If it worked for me, then it bet it will do some good for you too.  Plus, it's cheaper than all of the other acne products on the market that do absolutely nothing at all.  Oh, the acne on my chest and back is completely gone and I've noticed a glow of my skin all over my body.  I hope this review helps somebody to at least give this tea a try.  I never thought that my acne would clear up by just drinking some tea, but I am so glad it did. Oh, some of the other reviews talked about the tea having a bad taste.  Well it tastes really good to me and I would drink muddy water if it would clear my skin.  That's how bad I've been wanting to have nice skin.  The taste is not bad at all, I add a little honey and I love it, but if you don't like it, I bet you will continue to drink it once you see what it can do for your skin.

review/summary: works when used with other products
review/text: I'm 43, female, have had mild cystic acne off and on for 17 years, and in the last few years my go-to remedies (antibiotics and Retin-A) completely stopped working. Two months ago, my acne was getting so bad that I didn't want to leave the house. Since no "one" product had ever worked, I decided to try three products together, and 4 weeks later, my acne is gone. Here are the three products: Yogi Skin DeTox Tea, Acne Free Maximum Strength, and the 0.5mm MT Skin Roller. It took a full 4 weeks to get consistently clear skin. I did get one bump around the two week mark, and I had some old bumps that took a full 4 weeks to clear up. Here's what to do:<br /><br />1. Drink two cups of Skin DeTox tea daily.(Tastes great hot or cold.)<br />2.Use the Maximum Strength Acne Free system morning and night.<br />3. At night, use the MT Roller once a week all over your face over the Acne Free Retinol Complex. Apply a little extra Retinol Complex to problem areas after rolling.<br />4. At night, use the MT Roller over the Retinol Complex every other day between weekly rollings ONLY on problem areas. You can stop doing this once the problems clear up, or roll only when problems surface.<br />5. After the first four weeks, continue to use the roller weekly with the Retinol Complex or other products to remove old acne scars.<br />6. Use a 15-30 spf sunscreen daily. The roller and Retinol Complex will increase sun sensitivity.<br /><br /> I used the DeTox tea and Acne Free products for two weeks without rolling, and I saw improvements to my skin tone and texture right away, but the deep cysts remained. It wasn't until I started rolling with the MT Roller that the cysts started shrinking or came to the surface of the skin.<br /><br />I hope this works for other people, particularly people over 40. The MT Roller will be too harsh on 20-something skin. Go easy with the roller if you are under 40 and roll less frequently. Keep a sanitary environment when rolling and clean your roller afterward. Don't roll on broken skin or white pustules. See other websites on how to use and clean your roller. I soak mine in alcohol for 15 minutes after rolling.

review/summary: Great Tea for Skin Issues
review/text: I actually got this tea not for acne or to get 'glowing' skin, but because I read a few reviews that mentioned that this tea clears up bumps that appear on my hands and skin when it's really hot and humid out. Usually this is an all-summer problem for me and I've tried a bunch of different lotions and other remedies to try and clear it up. This is the first thing that actually worked. We just had a 95+ degree heat wave in my state and my skin is as smooth as ever! I couldn't be happier. I was honestly not expecting this to work, but it completely does.<br /><br />As for the glowing skin and blemish-free face, I cannot say. I don't normally have bad acne to start with, but I have noticed that any little issues that pop up aren't really as red as they could be, which is certainly a bonus as I wasn't really drinking this tea for that. I can't vouch for my skin glowing, but then, what does that even really mean?<br /><br />The flavor is pretty boring. It tastes somewhere between air and green tea. It does smell tasty, though.<br /><br />Tip: If you're using this for a specific problem, then you might want to consider applying the used tea bags directly onto your skin, letting it dry and then gently rinsing it away. It certainly doesn't hurt, and I feel it definitely has been helping me out.

review/summary: a great surprise
review/text: I am a green tea drinker for decades and purchased this product in order to get clear skin -I have been bothered by moderate adult acnes for years.  After drinking 1-2 tea bags for a couple of weeks, I started to notice some skin improvement in terms of clarity.  But my acne was still there, maybe to a less degree than before.<br /><br />More recently, I started to use a little bit of the hot tea as skin toner in the early evening before I drink the tea(by using a cotton pad to wipe through the entire face), and wash it off before bedtime.  I have been acne free ever since (for more than one month)!<br /><br />This tea is also relaxing.  I can drink it at night without losing sleep.  It actually improved my sleeping quality for the begining few weeks but later the sleeping benefit was not as dramatic.<br /><br />I did not like its taste at the beginning but with time I start to like it more and more.

review/text: I think the main benefit for your skin is simply consuming more water in the day.  Water is the great savior and healer of skin.<br /><br />The taste is just fine without sugar, so if this tea helps you drink more water in a day, then that's great!  Otherwise I didn't notice any miraculous skin transformations.<br /><br />I bought this for acne-prone skin.  It may work better for dry skin, but it doesn't do much for acne.

review/summary: DELICIOUS!!
review/text: I'm nursing so i had to carefully read the ingredients of this tea before buying, but all the herbs used are safe for breastfeeding moms.  I really cant say if the look of my skin has actually improved by drinking this tea, since i also recently started using arcona skin care stuff also that i order on amazon...but i can say that it's one of the most delicious tea's i've had!! Green tea has so many health benefits, and just a little caffiene so i drink it often.  i've also learned that squeezing fresh lemon in your green tea can boost it's benefits.  so i drink this tea with a squirt of fresh lemon off my tree.  also this tea is sweet b/c it has stevia.  so you really dont need to add anything to sweeten.  Yogi is my favorite brand of tea and this skin detox tea is a must have.<br />as far as my skin is concerned, i do notice a fresher glow, that could be the skin care line i've been using or it could be the tea, or it could be a combination of the two..who knows!  but i would buy this tea even if it had no skin benefits simply b/c it tastes so good.

review/summary: Works !!!
review/text: I didn't see results with this at first, so I had to up the dose to 2 bags at a time, 2 cups a day really cleared up my skin in a way that topical treatments couldn't. it's also great because too many skin creams, washes, toners, etc a day can irritate your skin, while this soothes. It tastes really bad to me mostly (i hate flowery tea ) but i'll drink it anyway!!!

review/text: I drink this tea 3 or more times a day. It has a taste of Rosehip sweetness but no sugar. I like the fact that it helps for DeTox. I usually order through amazon because it's cheaper than the local store.

review/summary: Yogi Skin Detox - Great Results
review/text: Unbelievable as it is, it works on my medium to severe adult back acne. Since I don't have many new breakouts, even my scars are starting to look better. Nothing else worked but this simple tea does.  Not crazy about the flavor so I make a large pitcher of sun tea using another flavored tea from and then either mix with a little lemonade or just sweeten.  I did not have high hopes.  First I got two boxes elsewhere but I am already on my last box of the Amazon 6 pack - reordering soon.  Simply amazing, and yes, it helped my face look better as well.

review/summary: Honestly shocked
review/text: For the past year I've been having trouble with my skin. Not a massive breakout, but I constantly had two or three MASSIVE zits that make a mess of my face. I've tried so many face washes, moisturizers, toners, oil absorbers and different foundations, my diet has changed radically and I was still getting zits. So I went out on a limb and decided to try this tea. I'm generally really skeptical of this stuff but I was at the end of my rope. One week on this tea and NO giant zits! For the first time in a year! No clue if it will keep up but it was nice to have a week without trouble.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: Haven't gotten a box of yogi tea I didn't like and this one is no different. It's more of an herbal infusion with green tea, so it might not be as "tea-y" as one might expect. But if you're unsure if you want to commit to a whole case of the stuff, I'd buy a box at the store and test it out, because a case is a huge price savings in my CT area of about about $1.50 a box, but it's an expensive loss if it turns out you don't like it. Hopeful for good results! I'm getting married in four months and am using this as a part of a healthier skin routine.

review/text: Well the product works,I look like i just came from a trip to Florida. My skin also looks better overall smother, really didn't have acne before i started taking this so i would not know about that. I would say give this tea try, I suggest you use the recommended 2 tea bags for faster results. This my first review and well I had to give this products its propz for it works.

review/summary: price increase
review/text: I bought this off Amazon on August 8th 2012, thru the prime option. It only cost $11.00 then. I honestly cant say I've noticed any results because I only recently started drinking it about three times per week.<br /><br />Anyway. I just don't think it's fair for such a price increase. Amazon is usually the best price and I'm glad I got the 6 boxes when I did. there is no way I'll buy them for this price, over $18.00!??<br /><br />I will follow up on if I think the product actually works for me. For now I'll say the taste is mild to me and soothing, too bad it has caffeine, it would be great for a evening tea.<br /><br />that's all!<br /><br />~Jen

review/summary: Pleasantly fragrant and flavorful
review/text: I absolutely love the smell and the taste of this tea, which is a combination of fruity and flowery scents/flavors. When I steep this tea, my entire apartments smells like it. Incredible!  And I love the taste; fairly strong and unique flavors. I can see for some that the taste may take some getting used to, but I have required no sweetener or the like.  The concrete skin benefits are still up in the air for me, however, I didn't purchase this with any major skin concerns in need of remedy.  Simply drinking more water as a result of drinking more tea and the boost of antioxidants is a positive outcome for me, even if I have yet to notice any improved skin quality.

review/summary: Not the typical Yogi Tea
review/text: I went to the asian market and the owner highly reccommended getting some burdock to add to Sushi and Oniguri.  It had this wonderful sweet-meaty taste and texture.  Yum! After eating it a couple times, I started CRAVING it.  I thought it was some type of pickled pork until I looked it up online; it is a root vegetable, and it has many beneficial effects including antiviral and antibacterial properties.  Then, I looked closer at the package and there were warning about it containing Saccharine.  So, I went on a search for other stuff with burdock root in it.<br />Yogi is my favorite tea-maker.  When I saw they have a tea with burdock root - I ordered a bunch. If it were made by any other company I would be happy with it.  But, this is a YOGI tea, and the taste is not the utterly amazing type of taste I've come to love from Yogi. It's not bad, just not up to par with Egyptian Licorice or Aztec Sweet Chili, neither of which need anything to make them taste perfect; no lemon, honey, sugar, or milk.<br />It tastes like something that should be labeled "mixed berry black tea" from bigelow or lipton. With sugar and lemon, it tastes like sweet-tart candies.<br />I continue to drink it because it does seem to be helping my skin - but I always feel sad reaching past the other Yogi teas to grab this one - the others just taste so wonderful.

review/summary: Poor germination rate, poor growth
review/text: I have tried to grow these in little starter plugs and I sowed directly onto a soil.  Both times germination rate was very poor.  Transplants died.  Direct sowing was a bit better but those geraniums were growing very measly.  I planted them in very good soil (I test all my soil annually) all other things grown in that soil were great!  I would give it 1 star, but give it a benefit of a doubt as I might have not know how to properly grow these geraniums.
