review/summary: Unique mix of crunchy dried fruit
review/text: Unlike the usual 'leathery' dried fruit, these freeze dried fruits are crispy.  All have excellent flavor, and are great for diabetic meal plans.  Some of the fruit is very fragile, and becomes powdery- however, the majority keep their shape.  Excellent, healthy snack :)<br /><br />Update:  For Pears...  (my review of the mixed fruit came up for this, so have to add, not do an individual review)<br /><br />The pears are good- but not as crispy as the other flavors. There are only 20 calories per package, so fit into a diabetic meal plan quite nicely.  They also have a gram of fiber per package (good for a 20 calorie item).  The pear flavor isn't really strong 'pear', but they're good. I can see reordering them again.

review/summary: Awesome healthy snack!
review/text: I like these so much I enrolled in the Subscribe & Save over a year ago.  It is not the cheapest snack, but I save money by ordering these in bulk through Amazon rather than buying these from my local grocery store.  There are no artificial ingredients or added sugars; this is just fruit.  Yet, this is a great portable snack that will not go bad sitting in your car, or your child's backpack.  I usually keep a supply in my car to satisfy my huger while driving home from work.<br /><br />I completely disagree with the serving size listed on the package.  It claims five servings per bag.  But, if you're eating these as a snack, you'll only get one serving out of a package, maybe two servings if it's for a child.  If you're using this on top of cereal or yogurt, then of course it will last much longer.  When the bag is empty, you'll find a bunch of fruit powder left at the bottom.  Don't throw it away, this makes a great topping for yogurt.<br /><br />This snack is not for everyone.  My kids and I love them, but my husband can't stand them.  These are not the consistency of other dried fruits, like raisins.  These are crunchy, just as the name implies.  You can happily crunch them like potato chips, or to make them last longer, eat one at a time, and let them slowly dissolve in your mouth, like a sugar cube.  Sweet without the guilt.

review/summary: Best of the Crunchies Fruits
review/text: I've tried all of the Crunchies fruits, and these are even better than the strawberries -- which is what attracted me to the brand in the first place. No negatives (even the price is decent), though I'd love to see more fruits in their line-up, such as pears and peaches -- and citrus if they come out well from the process. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Kids love them, so do we
review/text: These used to come as small cubes, they were delicious and the kids loved them. They now come as dry mango slices, the kids still love them. Ok, I eat them too. I think the previous formulation was slightly sweeter, and you could put it in cereal and the like, whereas the slices now are larger so you couldn't do that.<br /><br />Not quite sure why they reformulated them - they appear to have been out of stock for quite a while, and then when they were back in stock they are different. However, still good and still worth purchasing as a healthy snack.

review/summary: Freeze dried
review/text: I purchased these because I was curious to what all the different fruits would taste freeze-dried.  I realized that I'm not such a big fan of it because of the sudden transition from crunch to mush in the mouth.  I would rather have actual fruit that retain the crunchiness for me to enjoy as a snack.  However, I think these would be really good to mix into your morning cereal, both dry and with liquid, hot or cold.<br /><br />Half of these packages had a considerable amount of powder at the bottom...so I'm thinking I lost about 10% of the 1.5 oz of product.

review/text: I was looking at our local World Market for a sparkling Moscato and this one was recommended. I was a little skeptical because it costs a lot less than the one I normally get.<br /><br />I'm hooked. This one is crisp and tastes clean. Normally, the cheaper Moscatos can leave a kind of "sour" after taste.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer that this is MUCH better than the Barefoot brand. I personally don't like any of the Barefoot wines.

review/text: I have always loved this Nestle Cream ever since I was a child in England, especially over canned peaches...mmmmm.  When I moved to the US in 1979, I could not find it anywhere.  Eventually, Walmart & Kroger's started selling it a few years back but lately it hasn't been as readily available through them. But then I decided to look for it on Amazon and I was elated. However, on this particular occasion when I bought this item, I was actually sent LE LECHERA (which is more like condensed milk) instead of the TABLE CREAM which is what I actually wanted.  My review is about the product so that is why I gave 5-Stars and also because Amazon was very swift in processing my refund for the incorrect product that was sent to me.

Easy to grab and go, delicious, crunchy, all that you could look for in the morning.  Nice to buy them on sale or in bulk because they can be expensive.<br /><br />I like both fruit flavors of this product, but not as much the chocolate or cinnamon flavors.  I'm hoping they'll introduce more fruit flavors in the future.

review/summary: Perfect Bedtime Snack
review/text: I grew up having a snack right before bed. This is fine for growing kids or active teens, but now that I am older, it's not so great. Eating right before bed isn't the best idea if you are watching your weight.<br /><br />I enjoy anything that I can chase down with a glass of milk. A cool glass of milk just seems to go with the whole idea of a bedtime snack. Often I have grape jelly toast or a bowl of sugary cereal.<br /><br />Hmmm... no wonder I'm not losing any weight.<br /><br />These crisps are a much better option - two bars for 100 calories. I can drink a tiny glass of skim milk with them as well and feel perfectly satisfied. These fruit crisps are a nice alternative to other sweet bedtime snacks.<br /><br />This product is a wonderful option for those of us who are watching their weight AND like a treat before bed.

review/text: What I first noticed when I saw these was NEW and than the big green letters "10" Fruit Crisps and in TINY print it says 2 per pac. But on the other corner in even smaller print  and you can't see it on here it says 5 pouch's per box. With these costing $25.00 I thought there were 10 in a box. My thoughts, sort of SHADY of SPECIAL K!

review/summary: My favorite energy drink bar none
review/text: This stuff is straight up delicious. It has no syrupy feel or taste like most energy drinks. It tastes largely of lemonade with strong hints of black tea. Perfect start to the day, I usually drink one about an hour into my work shift. Very low calorie but full of taste.<br /><br />As of writing all the Amazon sellers are asking absurd prices. Try to find this at a local convenience store. The main brand of gas station around me sells it 2/$3.50

review/summary: Don't hesitate to buy this product!
review/text: I've been buying the various Simply Asia products at my local Dollar General Store at a really cheap price and I'm certainly pleased with the product(s). This particular one happens to be my favorite but they're all very good.<br /><br />I'm a scratch cook, preparing supper for my wife and myself every day, (I'm retired, she still works full-time), so I don't usually buy many microwave food products. However, I have fatigued of eating leftovers for lunch every day and these products have turned out to be the perfect solution. I like them much better than frozen dinners in terms of flavor and convenience. I've also found them much more savory than similar and comparable microwave dishes.<br /><br />For me, the bottom line is flavor and, secondarily, heartiness -- I don't want to be hungry again fifteen minutes after eating lunch. This dish goes into the microwave following a minimum of preparation fuss (all you need is a little water -- everything else is included) and is finished from beginning to end in just minutes. I cannot say enough about the good flavor, and the portion size is fully adequate for me which is a rare occurrence in my past experience with such products since I weigh 265 pounds.<br /><br />If you have any specific concerns about nutrition or ingredients, you can check those issues on the product description; however, I did wish to let others know how convenient and how tasty these Simply Asia products really are.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Took a bite and dumped it...
review/text: Normally I don't take the time to review food products I buy but this product was ABSOLUTELY GROSS.  The noodles tasted mushy and overcooked and the sauce and toppings were abysmal.  Maybe I have higher standards for asian food but the sauce is overwhelmingly and sickenly sweet (and thats just adding a little over half of the bic packet they give you), the sesame seeds had no flavor, and the "vegetable toppings" consisted of a tiny packet of bits of dried carrots and green onion.  Sesame teriyaki? Not even close.  Even dried ramen noodles taste better in my opinion (if only because they are deep fried).  If you REALLY want to buy it and try I'd suggest going to publix or kroger and sampling one before you shell out the money for 6.

review/summary: Mediocre but convenient
review/text: I haven't eaten a store-bought frozen or shelf-stable Asian meal in several years because I've always found the quality and taste to be sub-par. However, I thought that maybe the quality had improved over the past few years, and based on the generally-favorable reviews on Amazon, I decided to try the Simply Asia Sesame Teriyaki Noodle Bowl. I bought one on sale for about $2 at a local store. The package consists of a bag of noodles (fresh, not dried), a packet of dehydrated vegetables, a sauce packet, and a topping packet (as well as a bowl, lid, and spoon).<br /><br />The noodles came formed into a solid mass - I suggest crumbling them apart. The dried veggie packet was tiny - smaller than the seasoning packet found in a bag of ramen noodles. I'm not sure why the ambiguous term "topping" was used, when the topping packet appeared to contain nothing more than ordinary sesame seeds - maybe they're imitation seeds? At any rate, preparing the noodle bowl was quick and easy - dump the noodles, veggies, and sauce in the bowl, add a few spoonfuls of water, put on the lid, microwave for about a minute, stir, and sprinkle on the topping. The noodles had a good texture, and the overall impression was of warmed-up leftover takeout food (which I personally like, so don't take that as a negative).<br /><br />Portion-wise, I would say the bowl is adequate as a main dish, but I probably wouldn't be fully satisfied without an additional side dish like an egg roll, a cup of soup, or a small salad. The bowl is only about half-full when prepared. The package suggests supplementing the dish with cooked meat, tofu, veggies, or garnishes, so you can always toss a few leftovers into the bowl to bulk up the meal.<br /><br />The problem I had with this dish was the sauce. It was too strong (both in sweetness and saltiness) and there was too much of it. I would not have been able to eat it at all, had I not added about half a cup of leftover white rice to the bowl. Doing so thinned out the sauce and made it eatable, but even so I only managed to finish half the bowl. I personally would not purchase this product again, but if you like lots of strong, heavy sauce, you would probably enjoy this dish.

review/summary: Barely edible and way overpriced
review/text: I wanted to try this as an alternative to the typical ramen cup or bowl of noodles and was expecting a premium alternative looking at the price. I tried it and was not impressed at all. It's basically instead of a dry noodle product partially hydrated and instead of a powered sauce, the sauce is already hydrated. So it's a dry ramen type product at three times the price because it has most of the water in it still (I paid $3.00 for one bowl). I was expecting some meat or veggies in it like the hormel entrees do, but all this had was a few dehydrated veggies and spices and a small bag of seeds to sprinkle on. Not worth the expense to me, and it also did not taste very great to me. 1 star, overpriced for the taste.

review/summary: A tasty non-wheat cracker
review/text: I have a wheat allergy and struggle finding good tasting things I can eat. This is now on my list of tasty things. For having just caraway seeds and rye flour, it has a fairly good taste. It goes well with a variety of things including various cheeses and even tastes good with peanut butter. Moreover, it has practically no fat and lots of fiber. If you cannot eat wheat products or just want a good tasting alternative to crackers, this is a good choice at a very reasonable price. I do have one caution. This is not for folks who are gluten intolerant as rye flour does contain some gluten.

I love that they are made the old fashioned way and the taste is a mild "old man" type of flavor.<br />not very sweet, mild enough to slowly enjoy them and really appreciate each second of your candy experience. I tried having some friends try them and most did not care for them, only 1 other gentleman and myself really enjoyed them. I really like the old timey feel to them and will probably buy a bunch more.<br /><br />not to sweet, not to bitter, not to colorful or foolish. Just right!

review/summary: My Westie is Svelte!
review/text: I had an overweight Westie mix for years.  I decided to start counting his calories!  I found that these have the lowest calories and a good amount of protein and other nutrients. I started feeding him 1/4 cup twice a day.  He is a 14 yo and used to suffer from arthritis.  He now has a waistline and runs as fast as my 4 yo silky.  I really am pleased with this brand.<br />Also, I bought this from Wag on Amazon.  The bag came with small holes along both sides.  These were most likely from some machine.  Wag quickly replaced the item and recommended that I discard the damaged one.  How awesome is that.  Not only did they replace the item, but I felt confident that they would not just ship the bag to someone else, damaged and all!!  Great company!

review/text: I am an adult who loves sour candy.  "Sweet-tarts" that come in a roll are tasty but rather hard and I do not like that they changed the green tart from lime to apple flavor!  "Smarties" are less dense but do not have enough of a sour flavor for my tastebuds.  I also like "CryBaby tears" but they are so sour that I can not eat too many without my tongue becoming raw and my teeth starting to ache.<br /><br />I recently was out of town and visited an old-time candy store that sells candies by the bulk and happened to choose some "Xtreme Smarties".  Now I wish I had never walked in that store.  I loved these candies so much and then could not find them in any of my local stores.<br /><br />I must confess I am addicted to "Xtreme smarties". They contain the perfect amount of sour and the flavors are great!!  I'll be buying some larger sized clothing soon :)

review/text: I have been ordering these delicious granola bars for a couple years now through the Subscribe & Save delivery option.  I love the Harvest Spice flavor and the addition of Flax seed as well.  These are not overly sweet and not bland in the slightest.  My boyfriend is extremely skeptical of my "healthy" food choices but whenever I have these around, I find him eating them quite contently.  He says these taste great and I agree.  They are great for a quick hunger fix, mid-afternoon snack, or "on-the-go" breakfast start.  If my picky, meat-loving, junk-food eating 34-year-old boyfriend is giving a full five star rating, I'd say they're worth a try and a great addition to any pantry.

review/summary: Wonderful, Flavorful granola bar.
review/text: These are my favorite granola bar right now.  At first I was hesitant to try them when I realized how crunchy they were; I tend to prefer more chewy granola bars.  However, these a absolutely wonderful when dipped in a cup of warm chai.  I have one now with my tea almost every morning.  Yes, they are expensive here, but they are far more reasonable on Amazon than anywhere else on the internet, including Cascadian Farm's website.  My local grocery store carries only a limited selection of these products and even those are regularly $3.60 a box.

review/summary: The Bars that made us friends
review/text: We were two teenage girls stuck in the back of a car for two hours. The heat pounded against the walls, sinking into our very bones. We were unsure of each other. Small talk nipped at our teeth, but we hungered for something deeper. Friendship.<br />Her mother broke away from the conversation with my mother.<br />"This is for you girls."<br />5 words. 5 ordinary words that changed my life.<br />She handed me a granola bar. Cascadian Farm Organic Flax Right Harvest Spice flavored. I cautiously opened it up, would I like it? What if I got tired of it half way through? Was I brave enough to go at it alone?<br />But I didn't have to. There were two bars nestled in the plastic wrapper. I handed her one, giving her a shy smile. I bit into the granola bar. She did too.<br /><br />All at once I saw what wasn't there before. Things we had in common rushed out of my mouth, and hers. Jokes swarmed through the air, infecting us with laughter. How had we not been friends anymore? The moment we shared the granola bar, we shared our future.

review/text: These crunchy granola bars are really tasty but the price is just too high for my wallet. I had signed up for Subscribe & Save but even on the current 15% off promotion combined with the Subscribe & Save discount they are still way too over priced so I regrettably had to cancel my subscription.

review/summary: break easily- would NOT recommend
review/text: I really like all the other Green Sprouts products, but these are a no-go. Both the spoon and fork were broken easily by my 9 month-old baby. The spoon he easily snapped in half and the fork was shattered by him pounding it on the high chair tray. Luckily I was right there because the utensils broken and shattered into small pieces that were very sharp. I think they could be very dangerous if he swallowed a shard or put the broken end in his mouth. I would not recommend these at all. Instead try the Green Sprouts silicone toddler spoon. It is soft and flexible and has not yet broken for me.

review/summary: Artemis Dog Food
review/text: Wonderful kibble especially for small breeds as the kibble is just their size.  I have 2 bichons and they have been on Artemis for several years. I was unable to get the small breed adult formula so I temporarily opted for the puppy formula; just a little higher in fat content.  Just read the label and look at all the healthy ingredients.  They thrive and don't have many of the problems associated with bichons.  I highly recommend trying this product.

review/text: This product has an absolutely horrible taste!  It doesn't taste anything like lemonade and has only a vague artificial strawberry taste.  The predominant taste though is this weird artificial tart/bitter taste.  Even after adding extra sugar, it still tasted horrible.  My mom and I dumped the rest of the mix.

review/summary: Great biscotti, sources harder to find
review/text: Like other reviewers, these are most enjoyable to me.  Until fairly recently, the 1-lb 14-oz container was available at a great price from our local warehouse club.  Today however, only the chocolate flavor and in some stores for the holidays the gingerbread flavor is available.  I do enjoy these but the "Originali" is my runaway favorite.  The sources for the 1-lb 14-oz container show prices 40% higher than the warehouse club, and then you have to add unreasonable shipping amounts.  So the deal now is the 12-pack of boxes of 8 for a total of 96 biscotti at a price rivaling the warehouse club.

review/summary: Nonni's Biscotti, Toffee Almond
review/text: I had these Biscotti on vacation and really enjoyed them.  So when I saw them on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to buy them again at a good price.  While the Biscotti were very tasty, they were somewhat stale and not as crunchy as I remember from vacation.  Also, I noticed the expiration date was two months away from when I purchased them.  I don't know what the expiration dates are on those in the local grocery store but I wondered if these were excess Biscotti and that is why they were inexpensive.

review/summary: Great biscotti, but had better price...
review/text: I've just bought this biscotti at Walmart for $2.88 an 8-pack. Wonderful flavor! Chocolate flavor, with more chocolate on the bottom, deliciously crisp, and has a nice almond flavor, too.<br />However, if you buy 12 pack at Walmart it comes to $34.56, so the price here is not that great. I just don't like when they put a price here, then cross it and make you believe there's a deal you are getting.

review/summary: Nonni's Toffee Almond & Lemon Biscottis
review/text: great product; unfortunately shipping took a toll on the biscotti's (majority arrived in crumbs & broken pieces). Have since ordered an additional 8 boxes. The lemon ones were shipped in a second Amazon box which seemed to provide some additional protective, as only a few were broken in some of the boxes. Would recommend seller in the future ship all 12 pack boxes in a second box and add extra cushioning protection. It would allow folks to dunk their biscotti's rather than have to eat direct from the wrapper and get crumbs everywhere.

review/text: This is a wonderful snack to have whenever you have a craving for something to munch.  Each box contains 8 individually wrapped biscotti.  I normally don't like biscotti, finding it too hard on my teeth and too boring for my taste.  This brand's biscotti, however, has the perfect combination of sweetness, crunchiness, and chocolaty goodness!  It's made from Kosher ingredients and 100% trans fat free.  I bought a case (pack of 12) so I can share them with my family and friends.  Highly recommended!

review/text: Until recently, I was able to purchase Nonni brand Chocolate Decadence Biscotti at some of my local markets.  Then suddenly they disappeared from the shelves.  When I went on-line to the Nonni web page I was told I could order from Amazon...and I did.  The package arrived on time, was packed carefully and not one of the biscotti was broken.  All are fresh, delicious and enjoyed each day. They are individually wrapped, have 100 calories each, do not have strange ingredients...and they are perfect when they are dunked into iced coffee!!!!

review/text: Nonni's Biscotti is a good quality and tasty Biscotti. It is also available in most stores and supermarkets. Occasionally supermarkets have sales on Nonni's Biscotti, and when they do, It is much more cost effective then buying their product online which is higher priced. Overall, It is a good buy when Amazon can compete with those sales prices.

review/text: This biscotti is graced with a thin layer of limon (lemon) frosting sweetness.  Not the tough biscotti that has to soak for 10 min. before it can be eaten, these are easy to eat like a cookie, or quickly absorb your hot beverage.  My Japanese exchange student loved these, and when she returned with some to her home in Nagano, her mother wanted more!  So I purchased a case of my own and have sent her a couple of 8-count boxes as a present.  I have been unable to find them in the local grocery stores like I used to.  Other flavors are still available in stores, but not my beloved limon!  But they can be ordered!
