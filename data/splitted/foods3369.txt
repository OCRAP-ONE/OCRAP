review/text: I already had a  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P4TL8E">Keurig K-cup Storage Drawer Coffee Holder for 36 K-cups</a> that I use for my DECAF coffee, tea, k-cups so I decided to invest in a spinner for my favorites. I LOVE IT!!!!! The Black spinner is very nice, you'll be very happy if you purchase this Carousel.<br /><br />PROS-<br />- 35 k-cups fit<br />- Spins smooth<br />- small and skinny<br />- makes the k-cups very inviting<br /><br />CONS-<br />- I haven't found anything wrong with it, LOL.

review/text: I received my Black Keurig K-Cup carousel today, and I think it's perfect! Another reviewer felt that the quality wasn't as good as she hoped. I disagree. Mine came in perfect condition! I checked it over visually and saw no broken welds. I set it onto the counter and spun it both ways. Perfect! I loaded the K-Cups into the carousel, and spun it both ways again. It spins just fine both ways while fully loaded; and mine stands straight. It is very nice looking next to my Cinnamon colored Keurig Platinum Brewer System. Fits perfectly on counter under the cabinets. I like that it holds 35 K-Cups with a small footprint. I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it for yourself or as a gift. Was packed well for shipping.

review/text: I did not read the reviews about this carousel until after I purchased it, so I was rather dubious by the time it arrived at my house. However, sice placing it into operation, I have found it to be mechanically sound as well as an astetically pleasing addition to my kitchen countertop. I originally considered the drawer that goes under my Keurig B60 in order to store the K-cups, but decided that it would be much easier to clean up under the carousel if somthing spilled on the counter.

As others have stated when you turn the lazy Susan base you can see the tower is not even so it gives a little wobble. Not a deal breaker just something that i know would bug some. Otherwise the tower and base look nice. I would recommend for anyone needing k-cup storage.

review/text: I bought this spinner with the best of intentions, but didn't realize what a hassle it would be to keep it filled without missing a slot. My husband, being male, has to go through the entire carousel to pick his morning coffee, so I sometimes miss a spot. I just take whatever is in front, since the cups are all mixed up. So I will add back the missing star now, but if you have an A.R. in your house, beware!

review/summary: Comes Assembled and Spins Easily
review/text: I am so glad I finally bought a carousel to hold all my K-cups! Previously I just had a box that would hold them all and each time I wanted coffee I would have to dig around the box to find the ones I like. My wife and I have different tastes in coffee and now we can easily find what we are looking for. I was very happy to see that the carousel comes assembled and that it spins freely and very easily. This purchase has saved me counter space, the hassle of digging around a box of K cups, and also looks great! 5 Stars I highly recommend this to organize your coffee and save space.

review/text: Rack is well built and sturdy.  Only problem I have is it narrows at the top, so not all your K-cup will fit neatly inside (a few will stick out a little).  Besides that one minor annoyance it works great and has been on my counter since I got it.

review/text: I was looking for an attractive way to organize and display as many K-cups as possible (i.e., avoiding unattractive and bulky rotating wooden shelves). This fit the bill. I like a good deal and hate poorly-made products. Not only is this item high-quality, but it was a steal as well! I've been using it for several months now with no problems. It fits in with my classically modern kitchen, and keeps the max number of K-cups organized without looking tacky or obtrusive. I couldn't be more happy with it!

review/summary: Great for Working Mothers
review/text: I am a working mom and often feel like I don't get enough rest.  I depend on my caffeine fix to get me through my daily grind. I came across this product when a friend recommended it.  At first I was sceptical, because I hadn't heard of the product before, but I decided it was at least worth giving a try.  WOW, that's all I can say.  This product might not taste best in water, but in my orange juice I can't even taste the sweetener they add.  I found out that the ultimate results I got from taking it, whether mixing it in water or my juice, was the same... it gave me a great boost of energy.  I didn't feel jitters and it kept me going for hours.  In fact, I now use it at the start of my day and then later in the day before heading to the gym after getting the kids fed for dinner. This product is really convenient and I can even take it with me to work and take it whenever I want.  I did receive an insert with my order that suggested I cut the ends to get the product out best.  I would definitely suggest doing this as well.  I tried tearing it myself on one of the packets and it was difficult to get the contents out. I wrote to customer service and they told me that this has been addressed with their future batches.  But for now, that's the only negative... have scissors close by!  Overall though, I would highly recommend this product.  It works awesome and I never felt this from some of the other energy drinks out there.  I don't like most of the carbonated ones in the stores and the 5 hour upsets my stomach.  The price seems fair too, but maybe they can offer free shipping in the future for larger orders!  Just a suggestion from a happy and loyal customer! :)

I feel that anyone who uses this product will be extremely pleased.  One caution:  follow the measurements exactly.

review/summary: The Worst!
review/text: I just finished eating two of these, and I can say that they really are awful. The worst part has to be the coating. It is nothing like the chocolate covered Oreo's that usually come out at Christmas. You can tell from just looking at them that they are cheaply made. I believe that the coating is made from palm oil, as the package states that it is in them. This stuff not only tastes greasy and bad, but it also sits on your stomach the same way. Adults won't enjoy this, unless you have a cast iron stomach that can digest grease. Save your money, maybe this is a good time for us all to eat fruit instead.  (ps: you only get a thin, very thin Oreo. So thin, that I really wasn't even sure it was an Oreo.<br /><br />Update: Last week I was at a discount store and the manager came on the speakers and said they were selling "fudge covered Oreos for .$50 a pack." So I hurried to the front, and to my disappointment it was these things. I thought they were having the real fudge covered Oreos like you get around Christmas. I told the manager about my review on Amazon. No one was buying these things as I'm sure they had tried them before. I felt that the manager anticipated them flying off the shelves. They were still there when I checked out!

review/text: These crackers have a light and crunchy texture with a nice toasted wheat flavor.  I tried these along with the herbed Special K crackers and I like those a little better.  I had those with some homemade ricotta cheese and green olives; it made for a perfect late afternoon snack.  These multigrain crackers were very good with hummus.<br /><br />17 crackers is a generous portion for under 100 calories if you have a topping or cheese to go along side.  They are about the size of wheat thins but a bit thinner, crispier too I believe.  These were like a cross between a ritz chip and a wheat thin.  I wish they had less sugar in them.

review/text: My husband and I really enjoy these crackers.  The multigrain ones are a sweet cracker, and they also offer a more savory one.  Both have a decent amount of fiber too.  You can munch on seventeen of them and only consume 90 calories.  They are a great way to stop yourself from snacking on something with more calories when you just want something crunchy.  I have walked down the cracker aisle at my grocery store, and can't find another cracker that comes close to the low calorie count.

review/text: These crackers have become a staple in our household.  I love them and they are a healthy alternative to high calorie snacks.  With the multi-whole grains and crisp flavor, they are easy to snack on and not hard on your diet.

review/text: I'm sure they would have even fewer calories if they reduced the sugar content. It's the 3rd ingredient. They taste ok but are sweet.

review/summary: tasty little snack!
review/text: I picked these up locally to try them out and was very please. I was expecting crackers that tasted like the box, but these are nice and flavorful. They have a little hint of sweet from the grains and a serving is pretty good size and helps with mid-afternoon hunger pangs.

review/summary: tastes Like  wheat thins.. very sweet flavor
review/text: These are fine alternative to wheat thins but very sweet taste... of course if I had read the ingredients I could have told that what the predominate flavor...<br /><br />as Sugar is the  #3 ingredient..<br /> Ok but for me more like a cookie than a wheat cracker too put cheese etc on. but love the nutrition numbers.<br /> I won't be repurchasing these  for my use but am sure many would enjoy them.

review/summary: AMAZEBALLS!
review/text: I tried this on a lark.  I had tried skinny girl and as someone that counts calories, I thought it tasted so awful I would rather have a real cocktail and forego good.<br />So I was super excited when I ran across this, and tried it and found it so amazing! TASTES DELICIOUS!!!!<br />It makes your cocktail under a 100 calories and no icky chemicals that you cannot pronounce.<br />(My mom got auto immune and I stay away from artificial sweeteners!)<br />My fav was the Mango Margarita.<br />I also liked the cucumber mint one (the green drink)<br />I also made it virgin for my kids-they loved!<br />Def blend the mango!!!

review/summary: Rustic Pumpkin Spiced Black Tea
review/text: I could not wait for my pumpkin spiced tea to arrive. I quickly put on a pot of hot water, added the loose tea to my tea pot, and added some German Amber Rock Cane Sugar to the tea pot.  I removed the tea from its container, I could smell the spices from the tea. It smelled very much like pumpkin pie.<br /><br />I poured myself a cup and I couldn't wait to try it. As I smelled the steam rising from my cup, I noticed a hint of smokiness to the tea, which intrigued me.  The smell alone reminded me of several Thanksgivings I had spent with my grandfather on the family farm. I closed my eyes and I let the liquid make its way to my mouth.  I was quite surprised. I was expecting it to be a strong tea as the tea itself is a black tea. Black tea is usually a strong tea for me but in this case, it went perfectly with the spice blend. No cream was added to my tea. The German Amber Rock Cane Sugar embraced the tea flavor and enhanced the spices used.  I am sure if sweetened with honey, it would taste just as good!<br /><br />The price is wonderful for the gourmet tea but the price for shipping is a bit steep. I paid $9.90 for 2 canisters and the price to ship was $10.00<br /><br />I do recommend this festive tea blend!

review/summary: Good Base At A Bargain Price
review/text: I bought a jar of this base, (along with its chicken base counterpart)after coming across it here on Amazon.  It was by far the cheapest soup base I could find on here.  Fortunately they both turned out to be tasty worthwhile investments.  Using this base, along with some powdered bullion I bought here as well, has enabled me to make the best veggie beef soup in the united states. Try it, its very good

review/summary: The Best Root Beer at any Price!
review/text: Boylan's Root Beer is the finest drink of it's kind. The pure cane sugar really makes an enormous difference in the taste, unlike most others who use corn syrup. This is exactly what happened to Coke products when they changed to corn sweeteners. It really lost something! Try a Coke bottled in Mexico or Central America and you will see what I mean. This fact, along with Boylan's excellent blend of flavorings, makes their root beer the absolute best! I give it a hearty two thumbs up!

review/summary: The Beer that Made Haledon Famous
review/text: Boylan's Bottleworks Root Beer has a thin-necked amber bottle that harkens back to the days of real root beer...the kind made with bark and roots. OF course, the proof is in the taste, and Boylan delivers here too. While it has a moderate head of foam, the taste is dryer than the more popular root beers, and seems more authentic.  Another reviewer commented on the cane sugar sweetening, which also imparts a less syrupy taste and texture than corn syrup; I concur.<br /><br />The root beer has a fresh, clean taste, that seems to cut through lingering food flavors. It's a very satisfying, and truer tasting drink than the diluted "hint" of root beer offered elsewhere.  There is a distinct peppery aftertaste which is only partially moderated by ice; I enjoyed this  although it took a while to get used to.  (This taste may be due to the yucca extract.)  ALl together, this is both a thirst quencher as well as a unique "brew" that can be sipped slowly for the utmost enjoyment.<br /><br />Root beer was invented in 1875 by Mr. Hires (the name may be familiar to you), although precursors were available many years earlier. It's estimated that there have been over 2,000 root beer brands. Boylan's, based in Haledon, New Jersey, is also well known for its birch beer, a related product.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Carbonated water, cane sugar, natural and artificial flavors, caramel color, natural yucca extract, citric acid, and soium benzoate as a preservative.<br /><br />Nutrition Information per 11.6 fluid ounce bottle:<br /><br />165 Calories, no fat, 35 mg of sodium, 41 grams of carbohydrate, including a whopping 41 grams of sugar, and no protein.

review/summary: Monin Gourmet Sauces Caramel Sauce 12 oz. Sqeeze Bottle
review/text: I have seen Monin products used at Reed's Coffee Shop in the downtown area. I personally love the caramel sauce. It is creamy and rich tasting caramel sauce. It is a nice, thick sauce that still pours easily. I love it and I use it at home on ice cream and also in my coffee to give it that coffee shop taste. Monin also offers a white chocolate and a caramel sauce. All three of these sauces taste fantastic. It comes in twelve ounce squeeze bottle, however I have seen it offered in large pump bottles as well. Monin also offers high quality syrups for your coffee as well. I have not found a bad tasting Monin product yet!

review/summary: Seeds are not hulled
review/text: I ordered several types of seeds to sprout, and the buckwheat seeds were the only failure. Sprouting them is easy, but the seeds aren't hulled, which makes the sprouts difficult to eat. Removing the hulls after sprouting is too time consuming to be worth the effort. If you're looking for buckwheat seeds to sprout, buy a hulled variety.

review/summary: For growing greens, not jar sprouting
review/text: I am new to sprouting, very new in fact.  I read that buckwheat was a very easy sprout so I bought this organic seed.  Unfortunately, it turns out that this is not the right buckwheat for "normal" jar sprouting, this seed is for growing greens/grass and requires that type of sprouter.  This seed has the inedible hull still on it.  I think the description could be a little clearer.  If you want to sprout buckwheat look for hulled buckwheat or "groats".  But not toasted buckwheat or 'kasha', obviously that will never sprout, having been cooked.  The only upside is my birds seem to like it a lot so I guess it won't go completely to waste.
