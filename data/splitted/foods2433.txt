review/summary: Fresh taste so much better. We love this product
review/text: Yummy spoonfuls has been a Godsend!!  The fact that this food is FRESH, PURE, ORGANIC, and EASY is completely unheard of in today's marketplace. As a busy working mother, to prepare meals like this would require a lot of time that I would rather be spending with my family.  Yummyspoonfuls affords me the opportunity to provide extraordinary foods for my baby and not spend an inordinate amount of time preparing and storing it.  The simplicity of the product allows for a great degree of creativity in food combinations.  I am very pleased with this product and I wish it where in my local store. Thank you so much for a great product.

review/summary: Excellent, Yummy Baby Food
review/text: I have nothing but great things to say about Yummy Spoonfuls.  I have purchased the creamy variety pack several times and am now purchasing the Mushy stage foods.  In our area, it is very hard to find fresh/frozen organic baby food.  I really wish I had the time and knowledge to make my own food, but I don't and I truly feel Yummy Spoonfuls is the next best option to making your own food.  My baby has done very well with their food and I feel like I am offering healthier choices for my baby.  I have tasted everything that I have given my baby and everything tastes great.  At first, I was discouraged because I was going to order directly through Yummy Spoonfuls site and the cost to ship to California was extremely expensive.  Then I saw on Amazon and although the cost for the food is significantly higher, you can get free shipping which brings the cost to about $3.75 a container.  I have no problem paying $3.75 a container for frozen, healthy, organic baby food versus $99/$1.25 for jarred food.  Once you compare, you will never want to feed your baby jarred food again.  Also, Yummy Spoonfuls is flexible and willing to work with their customers.  When I place an order for a variety pack, I send them an email with the flavors that I want...so you don't have to go with the flavors that typically come in the variety pack (you have to choose at least 3 of the same flavor).  Bottomline, I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Best Organic baby food in the market.. So vibrant in color and yummy
review/text: I did another review with the peas, yes we are buying every and any flavors they offered in the stage one since this is the only brand my baby would eat.. Now that I have taken the time to read up on this amazing company, I am no longer surprised that their meals taste this good, just found out that they where actually voted as best organic baby food, also been given an award as most nutritious baby food, named most healthy on the go meals and lots more, look them up and try some, you and your baby will be very happy.. I could not believe how thick the purees are, I had to add a bit of water in the sweet potato before feeding my daughter Adrianne.. I made all the food for my oldest son and I can honestly say this taste by far better than anything I ever made.. I only wish they are in a store around me...I recommend this brand to every mom

review/summary: Yummy spoonfuls is the best thing I could have done for my son and our family
review/text: Yummy spoonfuls made all the difference in my and my son's experiences in getting him to eat healthy, organic solid foods as well as a variety of foods.  There is no other product on the market that compares.  These products are the freshest, most natural in color, "non-slimy" baby food to be found -  I really hesitate to categorize them as baby food.  They are so far above they are truly just food that can be consumed and used by any age group.  My son took to all of them from the start.  He is now a bit over 2 years and I still use them in combinations or as a base for my food bowls, "sloppy joe's" and bread spreads where I can add other chunky ingredients - vegetables, meats, fish, etc.  It makes all the difference for any mother - working or stay at home - to be able to provide straight from the container meals without guilt or add to them when time permits.  Yummy spoonfuls is the best thing I could have done for my son and our family.<br /><br />Thank you Yummy Spoonfuls for an amazing product..

review/summary: BEST TASTING BABY FOOD FOR AN ADULT !!!!!!!!!!
review/text: Due to some health complications my system is getting re-wired, doctors have me on baby food. Like a baby I am too start with single ingredient purees to easily identify any reactions. The past two weeks has been hell. Had forgotten just how horrible baby food was.. Just couldn't get myself go past the offensive stale odor that burst out upon opening the pouch.. A nurse at the hospital told me to try the frozen baby food option.. I picked Yummy Spoonfuls because it was one of the few that had a good variety of the single meals and boy am I glad I did!<br /><br /> Here is what I have tried so far..<br />The apple sauce: Never tasted apple sauce like this before.. it taste so light, clean and refreshing.. it taste like I took a bite directly from an apple only I didn't have to chew.<br /><br />The Peas: The color of the peas is so vibrantly green you can tell it wasn't over cooked...it gave me the courage to dig in and I love it.. taste just like steamed peas.<br /><br />Sweet potato: so cream, thick and sweet.<br /><br />Butternut squash.. Taste amazingly light....has never been my favorite food but I am loving it...<br /><br />Thank you for making such an amazing product... I am on baby food for the next 6 months.. I still cannot believe it is baby food.... You guys have completely changed my perception about baby food.. it is not all baby food that taste bad.. Thanks again for helping me during this difficult time in my life.. Please send flyers with my next order....I will pass them out at the hospital...<br /><br />From an adult taste bud point of view, this is impeccable. It is no surprise that babies across the country love this food.

review/text: After reading some of the reviews, I was leary to purchase this cocoa for our fabulous Keurig coffee maker, but had to try it out for ourselves.

review/text: I got a box of this cocoa along with my keurig i bought at a local warehouse store. If youve got curious kids, like mine-they were wanting to try out the machine as well. I am so glad they included this box of cocoa. Very nicely made-even with water is certainly drinkable. We went through the box in no time, and are planning a re-order.<br /><br />I would recommend you run the keurig through empty once before having a cocoa. My first one tasted coffee-ish.

review/summary: Weak unless you excavate the rest of the cocoa out
review/text: The output of Green Mountain Cocoa K-cups is highly variable - sometimes it's a well-flavored cup of cocoa, sometimes it's just brown water.<br /><br />This is because sometimes, a significant amount of the cocoa powder stays behind in the cup after the brew cycle. To really get a consistent product, you have to pierce the foil top to see if there is stuff left behind; scoop it out and stir it in, and you get the well-flavored cocoa some reviewers are raving about.<br /><br />This, however, is ludicrous - it defeats the fire-and-forget interaction that makes the Keurig worth it.<br /><br />The only thing that saves the product from a 1-star review is that its quick sugar hit has prevented many an afternoon nap at work. :D

review/text: The chocolate flavor is weak.  What you need to do is use the smallest cup size, then after it is done take out the cup, open the lid of the K cup and scoop out the rest of the powder.  It's drinkable, but barely.<br /><br />Worse then the extra fuss of mixing the powder yourself, is the flavor.  There is a VERY DISTINCT plastic aftertaste.  I thought maybe the water was just so hot it melted the cup, but the plastic cups are made of seem to be the same as the coffee ones which do not have this aftertaste. I think the chocolate is just not a good flavor.  Next time I'm going to try ordering a different brand.

review/summary: Great Easy Hot Chocolate
review/text: Now first let me start off by saying I am not a big chocolate fan. That being, the taste I percieve as being "great" may be different from yours. If your looking for that rich chocolate flavor then this beverage may not be what your looking for. This is by no means "chocolate flavored water." Its got flavor (as long as you stay with the first two size settings) and is so easy to make why bother with anything else. The bottom line: If your looking for a cup of hot chocolate with a powerful chocolate flavor, these k cups are not for you. If you are looking for a cup of hot chocolate with a moderate amount of flavor then give these a try.<br />When trying these k-cups I did not add anything else before serving (ex: marshmellows) I hope you enjoy and dont let the low review scores point you away from enjoying the easiest cup of hot chocolate you have ever had.

review/text: I have to laugh at those who give this hot cocoa a poor review. If they would only read the directions it is stated clearly that you have to shake up the k-cup before brewing. Just for kicks I tried the cocoa both ways--first shaking it and getting the best cup of hot cocoa ever, and the 2nd time not shaking it up and getting brown water as some have described here. So the moral of this story is READ THE DIRECTIONS and shake up the k-cup before you brew your hot cocoa! Seems simple enough.... :D

review/summary: The trick to good cocoa
review/text: The first two or three K-cup cocoa cups I brewed were pretty wretched, even when I shook the cup heavily before using and used the smallest brew size. Then I decided to put a little mik in a mug (an ounce or so), open the K-cup and empty its contents into the mug, then brew hot water only, using the intermediate brew size, directly into the mug.  The resulting cocoa was very good and the extra step of emptying the K-cup was no work at all.<br /><br />I'm not sure I really needed the extra milk, but I like milky cocoa so I added it.<br /><br />I'll be curious to see if this hint helps anyone else.<br /><br />PS  I still prefer the taste of  the powdered cocoa packets (Ghirardelli) that came as a sample with my brewer (or similar ones from Bellagio), but the K-cups are convenient, too

As someone previously suggested, this is taken care of by just simply shaking the K cup before putting it in the machine.  That's it.  (thanks for sharing!) The best part is Green Mtn is the only one I've found that doesn't have "Hydrogenated Oil" as the lead ingredient.  Just for that alone they earn an extra star!

I have found that if I make it as per the box directions, I'll have about 1/4 of the cocoa still inside the cup.<br /><br />Also, you do not want to do this on the large cup size - it will be so diluted that will not want to drink it. I make it using the middle sized cup and use 2 k-cups.<br /><br />I got this on sale for $7, so it wasn't too bad of a price, but I think in the future I will just stick to buying a container of hot cocoa.

review/summary: 10x the cost of Swiss Miss packets for an inferior product and no real convenience factor!
review/text: Let me start this review by saying that I ***LOVE*** my Keurig machine! I can get a great cup of coffee, any strength, any brew, any boldness, any flavor, without brewing up a whole pot. It is a brilliant concept for coffee, which has always lent itself to either mass-brewing or pathetic "instant-coffee".<br /><br />Tea and cocoa, however, typically cost anywhere from $1-$4 per box of 20-30 bags/packets. Tea and cocoa are inherantly single-shot items to begin with, so the idea of paying $10-14 for a box of 24 tea or cocoa K-cups is ludicrous. It offers no real extra convenience and costs about ten times the price. It would be like buying a Kia Rio for $8,000 or a Daewoo Leganza for $80,000... they are both basically the same car, so why pay ten times more for one? It just makes no sense.<br /><br />On a side note, I also have found that this cocoa is a bit watery at times and doesn't even hold up to a packet of Swiss Miss and some hot water.

I would put some marshmallows in the bottom of of the cup and push brew, and you have a nice cup of hot chocolate with a creamy marshmallow layer on top.

Because if you look in the used k-cup, there's the rest of it sitting in the bottom of the cup! Brainless. Better that it's NOT in your cup because of the ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER that is NOT LISTED on the package gives it the tell-tale metallic taste. That's inexcusable, they need to label their products has having an artificial sweetener and artificial flavor, ugh. In addition, it's a trash creating machine, all those k-cups in landfills.

review/text: Even though convenient, the "Hot Cocoa" really isn't exactly what is says.  It is more like drinking colored water.  It really was so bad, that my partner tore open the cups and placed the powder in milk.  It took 2 k-cups to make one 10 ounce cup of cocoa.  It was okay then, but it's much easier to get some good ole` fashioned Hershey's chocolate and make a cup that I would just crave.  Besides, living close to Hershey, where the air constantly smells like milk chocolate, supports my local economy!

review/summary: Tasteless!!
review/text: Prior to trying this we had been using the ghirardelli hot chocolate packets for the Keurig machine.  My kids hated this product.  It tasted like water on the 7.25oz setting on the B70 machine.  I also tried it using the 5oz setting and adding it to coffee.  It was pretty much tasteless. The K-cups may be more convenient but there is no comparison in taste.  My kids prefer the packets and so do I.

review/summary: Green Mountain Hot Cocoa K-Cups -- Woof!
review/text: Firstly, as a rule I don't write bad reviews (nobody needs that kind of karma). But after trying this "cocoa" on 5/19/12 (and I see that a lot of reviews are much older) I thought I'd just warn those of us who might like real cocoa. The main issue is that it is physically impossible to contain sufficient mass of ingredients in a K-Cup to make hot chocolate. A decent cup of cocoa needs at least 3 tablespoons of a quality cocoa powder (such as Droste) to have any flavor at all in 240 ml of liquid (not to mention the other ingredients). While a relatively small mass of ground coffee can make an outstanding cup of brew (think Pike Place Roast), this product can't even stand up to a Swiss Miss (and, sorry, she's terrible--those of us who require a robust cup of cocoa need a real woman!). (That's a joke on the play on words--approved by my wife--a REAL woman so don't accuse me of un-PCness please...)<br />And oh yeah, this stuff tastes salty as well. Otherwise it CAN be made into a HOT DRINK of some sort; just not a passable cup of cocoa.<br /><br />...hey Sandra, are you busy? could you please come and take look at this? I'm not being too snide am I? Thanks honey!

review/text: I love hot chocolate so when my wife got a Keurig I had to try the hot chocolate. Boy was it awful. The chocolate taste was so weak I had to add a good scoop of Swiss Miss to make it drinkable. There was also a taste of plastic, I think the K-Cup gets so hot it actually melts the cup a little.

review/summary: Average
review/text: Is this hot chocolate....yes<br />Is this good hot chocolate....um, sorta<br />Is this gourmet hot chocolate....not a chance.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only advantage you get but using the Green Mountain K-cups of hot chocolate is the simplicity of using your Keurig machine to heat the water instead of using the microwave or stove-top. Other than that the finished product is comparable to any Swiss Miss or other brand of powdered instant cocoa. It actually may be worse if you use the largest setting on your machine. The largest setting makes it much too watery.<br /><br />Green Mountain needs to go back to the drawing board on this.<br /><br />3 stars because it does make hot chocolate in your Keurig without having to dirty dishes and tear open pouches, but if you're looking for good hot chocolate, keep shopping.

The trick to having this taste great is a few things:<br />1-Its needs 1 teaspoon of sugar or sweetener added to it<br />2-You cant use it with the larger oz setting,6 oz makes the best flavored drink (that isnt watery)<br />3-shake the cup before you use it<br />4-if you use the Keurig for coffee,run water through it without a KCup,to get rid of the coffee flavor if you dont like coffee.

review/text: While I love the taste of Green Mountain Hot Cocoa, the prices for these k-cups on Amazon are outrageous. I have seen this product advertised on other sites for almost half the price. I would shop around for a better price. It seems like the vendors on Amazon are ripping consumers off. I rated this product 2 stars because of the price. If I was rating for flavor alone, it would be 4 stars.

I also try to run a cup of plain water after brewing my cocoa to prevent the possibility of cloggin when I brew my next beverage  - probably Tully's French Roast.

Simply add a dash of coffemate cocoanut creme, for an almond joy, add equal parts of coffemate amaretto and coconut cream, its heaven, fellow chocolate lovers!

I'm going back to Timothy's, which is far more flavorful. Additionally, I notice it seems to clog up my k-cup holder more than other cocoas I've tried. I generally don't leave bad reviews, but this was just plain NOT worth the money. The seller was very good however, I have no complaints in that regard. I just wouldn't buy this brand of cocoa again.

review/text: The other reviewers are right - this tastes like watery hot chocolate, like what you might get at a chilly high school football game for $1. You CAN open the K cup and pour out what gets left in there, but what's the point? It didnt improve the flavor and that kinda defeats the purpose of making it in a Keurig. I resorted to buying a canister of Ovaltine to mix in, which still defeats the purpose but at least they didn't go to waste.<br /><br />With so many coffee choices, I thought there would be more hot chocolate ones too but I should have researched it more before we bought it. There are only a couple other choices, but I am waiting for them in the mail and so can't comment. But I wouldn't buy this brand again...I'll go back to packets in the microwave before I do that.

review/text: We recently acquired a Kurig B70 from Amazon, and were looking for various products to sample. We came across this hot chocolate, when it was advertised at $9 with free shipping. It seemed like a reasonable offer, and we ordered one. After sampling, we ordered several more.<br /><br />We brew these at the largest B70 size, which may make some difference in comparison to the experience of other users. With few exceptions we always get a very good cup of hot chocolate.<br /><br />Unfortunately the price has recently gone up. For $9 this was a very good offer, for a quality product. At the current prices, we may find an alternate similar product at Amazon or perhaps elsewhere.<br /><br />Should Amazon re-stock this for $9 with free shipping, I will definitely be buying more.

My husband likes to add a packet of splenda as well.  We drink a cup almost every evening in the winter and the kids enjoy having a K-cup they can make.  It is low calorie, it s made with coconut oil and artificial sweetener.  But, I think its a really nice treat.  Its not ghiradelli stirred into warm milk on the stove, it can be made in 30 seconds and for that convenience, I think it is very tasty.

review/summary: Watery because it doesn't work
review/text: The other reviewers who stated it's watery is because the machine does not get all the cocoa out of the k-cup.  It is actually DELICIOUS hot cocoa.  To get it to "work" right, you have to either just cut open the k-cup and dump it into your mug, then let the machine put water in your mug.  OR Run it through the machine, then cut the k-cup open and scrape the rest of the powder out and stir it into your cup.<br /><br />Either way, don't use the largest cup setting as this will dilute it too much...medium is fine, small is richest.  This IS actually REALLY delicious hot cocoa! but would be better in envelopes to avoid the k-cup plastic waste, since the k-cup cocoa mix does not get completely "used up" in the machine anyway.

review/text: The first time I tried it, it did taste too watery, but that was on the largest setting on the B70.  Now, I make it on the sm-med or med-lg setting and add milk and marshmallows.  So yummy!  I took apart the K-cup to see if there was a filter or anything inside, and no, there's just the powder.  The price of one k-cup is about twice the price of a regular (swiss miss or similar) packet of hot cocoa you'd buy in the store, so we switch off between the two.  With a packet, you have to stir and stir and stir.  With the K-cup, it's already ready with no stirring!  (If you're a slow drinker, you may need to give it another stir when you get close to the bottom, of course.)<br />I greatly prefer K-cups over the packets.  If they were the same price, I'd never use the packets again.

review/text: These are the first thing I used after I got my Keurig, and man was a dissapointed. I was affraid everything from this machine was going to taste this way. The cocoa is watered down, and the reason for it is that most of the cocoa remains in the cup, even if you shake it before putting it in the machine. If you go through the hassle of scooping out the left over powder from in the cup and mix it in, it still isn't very good. The only thing I use these for now is to mix with coffee to make a mocha. If you're looking for a decent cup of hot chocolate try Gloria Jeans, they're pretty good.

review/text: I bought three boxes of the Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa so that my daughter could easily make hot cocoa in my Keurig brewer.  She was about to make a cup last night but just in time, she saw "TREE NUTS" listed in the ingredients!!!!  I'm glad she spotted this, since she has nut allergies.

review/summary: The only food I will feed my dogs!
review/text: I have two senior dogs that were on a raw natural food diet for many years.  I had been hard pressed to find something that would fulfill my pets nutritional requirements while being comprised of healthy ingredients.  This is it!  Even my vet, a fierce advocate for raw food, approves of this.  My dogs love it, I no longer have to mix my own ingredients together, and I have peace of mind knowing my beloved pets are being fed high-quality food.  They devour every last particle!

review/summary: My Yorkie Likes It, So I Like It
review/text: My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine.

review/summary: Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound
review/text: I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.

review/summary: Feed my two dogs only Wellness brand. Consistently on top ten canned dog food lists
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and otehr healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: This is the ONLY food my dog will eat
review/text: I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.

review/summary: Great for hiding medication.
review/text: My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.

review/text: I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.

review/text: I just got my 1yr old shihtzu the turkey and she loves it. I mix it with her dry food. It does have a gel substance around the food. I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff
review/text: I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.

We stick with fresh food treats such as: apple, sweet potato, egg, and some cheese once in awhile. Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great!<br /><br />Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods!  Read articles on rendered meats, your stomach will turn.  Take care!

review/summary: Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!
review/text: My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a "good" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought "stuff", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!

review/summary: Looks like Pate meh  -1 star
review/text: well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)

review/summary: My dog Sashie loves this supplement w/ her dry food!
review/text: I have to say its a bit pricey but at the end I actually saved alot because you only need to give a couple of spoonful along with the dry food. My dog loves it! You have to make sure you give a small amount depending on the size of your pet because it's high in calories. Sashie did not experience any problems when I switched to this new dog food. It's also a great coverup for any medications your dog might need to take.

review/summary: My fussy eater loves this
review/text: My geriatric dog has been an extremely fussy eater ever since I brought her home at 14 weeks.  I recently tried Wellness kibble and wet foods and she likes them all, but she particularly LOVES the 95-Percent canned toppers and WOLFS her kibble down with this product mixed in.  Wish I had tried Wellness foods before but better late than never.

review/summary: Good value and fast shipping
review/text: This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.

review/summary: Great food topper for my dogs
review/text: I have been feeding this to my 1 year old maltese and 4 month old chihuahua. I mix this in with their dry food and they both enjoy it a lot. It's a great deal buying from amazon compared to buying it at a pet store.<br /><br />The only down side is this food does dry up after leaving it out for 5-10 minutes.

review/summary: Perfect as an occasional supplement!
review/text: My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as "inspected for human consumption". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.

review/text: As a newly adopter of a one year old, I tried certain foods with not much success.  My dog loves this food, and I do too, as she eats well and healthy.
