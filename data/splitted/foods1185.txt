review/summary: Great Dark Roast Coffee!
review/text: This coffee is great because its one of the darkest roasts you can find with a really low acidity.  Its even better if you can get it in whole bean to grind yourself.  It smells and tastes wonderful.

review/text: This is a very good package of carmel corn.  I do not like Carmel Corn with a lot of peanuts included.  "Crunch 'n Munch" has a small amount of peanuts so I am able to enjoy the carmel corn which is really what I am after.<br /><br />The 4 once sized package seemed small at first look but it is just enough for a quick snack while watching TV.<br /><br />I will purchase more in the future.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />3589

review/text: First I want to say that we absolutely love this product. We found this in Germany and fell in love with it. So we were pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon.  However, we ordered it and it never came . I also found that this product is definitely over priced. We ended up cancelling our order because it never came according to the time that was promised. I was actually very patient and waited for a good 4 weeks and it still didn't come. I tried to contact the seller through amazon, but never even got a response. So after cancelling, I found a nearby German deli and it was less than $5. Don't waste your time in ordering this.

review/text: I never knew how good oatmeal was until I tried Mornflake. I have it for breakfast every day. It took a little try and error to get it just like I like it. I put the water and oats in the pan and let it set for about 10 min before cooking then put the lid on and let it set for another 5 min. I then add a little cane syrup and milk. I hope a lot of people buy this so Amazon will keep carrying it.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000II4CN0">Mornflake Jumbo Porridge Oats, 26-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>  Where in West Los Angeles can I purchase this superior,creamy and most flavorful breakfast cereal?  I find Mornflake Oats by far surpass all its competitors and I have tried every one of them I can find. These oats are full of life force unlike other oats which turn grey upon cooking. Mornflake oats become slightly golden are ultra creamy and tasty.<br />  Please pack this treasure in sturdier boxes and cartons they tend to arrive slightly crushed and sometimes open.  I have noticed this when buying Mornflake oats through amazon.com and at Whole Foods market. Lamentably, Whole Foods no longer carries  this product in L.A., nor does anyone else whom I can find. They are really "missing the boat" by failing to stock this item. Even amazon.com had only one case left the last time I ordered! HELP!!!

review/summary: Mornflake has changed packaging, branding
review/text: Mornflake Jumbo Porridge Oats is an outstanding product, available until recently here in the US in the 26-ounce box shown here.  However, there's been an apparent change in the marketing, and the product is available in the UK, at least, in 26-ounce bags. If you visit the Mornflake website ([...]) you can find out more about the porridge and other interesting products, along with a history of the company.<br />Please, Amazon, it's probably a small group of us who is seeking out this product, but it's worth the search to find it here. Can you continue to supply Mornflake Jumbo Porridge Oats in its new identity and packaging? There's no oatmeal of its kind - Irish, American, or English - I have tried that can hold a candle to it. There are good steel-cut oats from small Irish mills, but that's another category of the grain. These oats make great breakfast cereal, but they also are great ingredients for super meatloaf and fabulous oatmeal raisin cookies. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Best oatmeal ever
review/text: I first bought this brand of oats in a small local grocery store while visiting family out of state.  First thing I was impressed with was how little packaging this product uses.  Just the box, that's all.  No liner, no additional layers to have to cut and tear through.<br /><br />But it was the taste and texture that was SO much better than any oatmeal I've ever had that when I returned home, I had my family buy it and mail it to me!!  Then I thought to check Amazon, and not only did they carry it, it is one of their Subscribe and Save items.  I immediately signed up.<br /><br />The oatmeal has the perfect blend of creaminess as well as texture, and wonderful taste.  I make it in the microwave, and what I've found the best technique to get it really creamy is to add more water than needed, and then at the end, boil it for a minute or two (in the microwave, with the pot's lid off) till it gets to the right consistency.  (Be sure to do this in a LARGE pot .. twice the size you need or more .. and watch it constantly so it doesn't boil over!!)

review/summary: ...Just like being back in England, but with better weather....
review/text: This oats are exactly what I was looking for. When I first came to the States I was looking for some Porridge (that's how we call it in UK). Tried different ones and, eventhough some looked just like this oats, I just could not find anything that would get creeeemy like the porridge I use to have on a bleak morning in England (every morning...). I then found this at my local Giant, but they don't always have them.<br />I love you Amazon for stocking this wonderful product. The price it's great too, the only weird thing is getting 12 packs at the time. I never use to buy grocery in a bulk!<br />The product is outstanding; I use a ratio of 2 and 1/2 amount of liquid (I use 2/3 water and 1/3 milk) to 1 unit of oats, bring it to boil and then let it simmer for 15-20 minutes while I shower. It gets so creamy, you hardly need anything else...maybe just a tad of sugar!! Healthy and delicious way to start the day!!

review/text: I've been making wine from packaged wine kits now for several years and when I saw the Chateau Classico kits on Amazon for $85 I had to try one.  First of all, $85 for a 16 litre red wine kit is a great deal and it comes complete with labels, real corks, and foil caps.  Add that to the free shipping and no sales tax and it's a no-brainer.  The wine is great. I've completed 17 of these Chateau Classico kits now of various types and they are all good.

review/summary: Italian Nero D'Avola Cabernet
review/text: I just bottled this wine. It stated it was a full 6 gallons. In order to get 6 gallons, I needed to top off with better than a gallon of water. I thought that would dilute the wine too much, so I racked it into a 5 gallon carboy and proceeded from there. I did add oak chips during the fermenting process.<br /><br />The end result, this wine is great. When I asked my wife what she thought, she said this wine is way better than the wine she buys today. I'd defintely do another one of these.<br /><br />Since I didn't get the full six gallons - therefore 4 stars. I did a similar report on the Malbac.

review/text: The bars I received were crumbled on one end & light tan in color, which indicates OLD chocolate. That end of the bar tasted awful. I have seen that a million times & I recognize what it means. The other end of the bars had melted & reset, but still tasted OK & were the correct color for fresh chocolate. A second set was sent to me at no charge, however, the same was true of those. Also appeared that the company was not too happy with my complaint, as the second set arrived in a small, smashed box with a tiny piece of bubble wrap floating around loose in the box & had not been secured to the bars with tape to protect them.

review/summary: One of the better T-Discs
review/text: I have tried about 75% of the available T-Discs, and the Kona Blend is one of the best regular/unflavored coffees for Tassimo. It has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering, and has a pleasant aroma. Personally, I would enjoy it more if it were stronger/bolder. However, being a bit mild, it goes well with breakfast and/or (gluten-free) baked goodies. I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect, nor is a subscription service available. Originally found this at (Dead Bats from) Beyond, used a 20% coupon, and was happy with the final price.

review/summary: Note: Rating both coffee and seller
review/text: This coffee is good but, for me, it's nothing special. I will buy it again because it's a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this "Kona coffee" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And don't expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it.

review/summary: Best price for Chimes
review/text: After trying Chimes in the smaller store bought bags, I found a new treat I love.<br /><br />The Mango pairs nicely with the Ginger in these chewy little candies. The sweetness smooths the spicy side of the ginger leaving me with a happy mouth. (And nice breath as an added bonus). I usually enjoy one or two a day as I tend to suck on them not chew them, thus they last quite a while. The 5 pound box drops the price in half, making the price for 5 oz about $1.80. (Fortunately for easier storage, the chews come in one larger bag not individual 5 oz bags.)<br /><br />I have found if I have one when I get 'hungry' after dinner, it fills the dessert void and helps keep me out of the fridge and pantry. I just tuck in the side of my mouth and the flavor keeps my mind and mouth busy enough to keep my no eating after 8pm rule in check. At 4 carbs, Zero fat and 16 calories, I can keep myself on track.

review/summary: Fabulous candy!
review/text: These ginger chews are a very "satisfying" candy and really wake up your mouth.  i had purchased small packets of both the orange ginger and mango ginger chews at a local store, and when I discovered how fabulous they are, I searched for a source and bought the 5-pound box from amazon at a far cheaper price than buying the small packets.  Both flavors are great but we preferred the mango a bit more so purchased that one.  We are not "tired" of them, even having purchased the 5-pound quantity.  Only negative is that the wrappers can be a bit difficult to open--you have to find just the right spot to pull them open. So if you have arthritic fingers (I'm just thinking of my mom) these candies could be a problem to open.

I give samples away all the time, to waiters (oh, I mean "servers"), co-workers, etc.  Besides the risk of pulling out a filling (cavity filling), these might be too spicy for some folks ... but that's what makes 'em so good!!!!

review/summary: The Best
review/text: According to ginger loving friends, this flavor is the best. It seems to please everyone. The mango gives it a great flavor and it seems a bit smoother than some of the others. The warmth of the ginger and the fruity mango make a unique and irresistible combination.<br />Addictive! As with other ginger chews, great for sea sickness, etc. Buy the tins and use this 5 pound bag to refill.

So off to Amazon another friend and I went and found them with no problem.  These candies are wonderful for the nausea us cancer patients experience.  I have recommended them to others and they too have ordered them.  I hope this product stays around for a long time.  Great price for a huge amount of candy.

It's great for when you're under the weather, when you want something light and sweet, when you're feeling a light sea-sickness, for hangovers, and even for those times when you've eaten too much and have some light indigestion.  The local stores sells 5 ounces for $5, which makes this 5 lb box a GREAT deal.  We have it on the "subscribe and save" for auto delivery, which makes this an even better deal.

review/summary: Mango-ginger chews work
review/text: My mango ginger chews are fresh-tasting and very slightly sweet with a zing from the ginger ingredient. They remind me of chewing gum or taffy, but are "stiffer" than either. Chewing and swallowing 5-6 of them helps relieve nausea, but they do take a few minutes to work. The effect is not strong so you may need to chew more, after you have given the first chews a chance to work, if you are still nauseated.

review/summary: Good basic kit. Do some tinkering to really make it shine.
review/text: I have been making Chateau Classico kits for about a year now. The initial batches were as directed using included ingredients. The results were drinkable, decent wine. But adding Medium plus toast American Oak chips, really pushed these kits over the top for me. The result of putting this kit (and a Dolcetto) on oak for a week was a fuller bodied, immensely drinkable wine.<br /><br />The kit does not include any kind of oak like some others. I may try adding some oak powder when I pitch the yeast in the next batch to see how the wine changes.<br /><br />So far, I cannot complain about this brand of kit. I subscribe and save $15 per kit, which brings this kit in at almost half the price of some of the better known manufacturer's kits. With a little experimentation, you can get excellent results with this kit.

review/summary: Best Wine Kit I've tried!
review/text: I have been making wine for just under a year. This is my fourth kit. I tried the other cheaper cabernet merlot 4 week kit sold on Amazon and was not very happy. So I decided to spend a little more money and see if there was a big difference. The directions were a little off but I've done this enough times now including making wine from fruit that I had a pretty good idea of the order of things. I did the full six weeks. I did not filter. I racked once at about 5 weeks and 2 times before bottling. It made 29 bottles plus enough to fill 2/3 of one. I put the 2/3 full bottle in a bottle I had with a screw top and kept it on the stove for the past 2 weeks thinking I might use it to cook. I poured myself a glass last night and neither my husband nor I could believe it! It was SO SMOOTH! It had great body. It was perfectly CABERNET like I was looking for all along! If I had filtered it might have a little better clarity than it does, but it really doesn't seem to be affecting the taste. I am so impressed with this brand I setting it up for automatic delivery. I also am going to try their Pinot Noir next and hope for the same results. If you like dry and smooth, this is the wine for you to make!

review/summary: Very nice
review/text: Thus far I have made it the fermentation process and I have intentions of, upon completion of this kit, to put the kit into my 5 gallon barrel and let it bulk age for awhile.  I must say I am pretty impressed with this one.  I've added very little water, I'd say about 2.5 gallons over the fermentation/racking process.  There has been little to no sediment and it tastes bold, like a Cabernet should.  There is however no oak powder or chips included in this kit, thus explaining why I have the awaiting barrel.  Of course the addition of the labels and the shrink caps and the corks make this kit very worth while.  If you have purchased one of the cheaper kits on Amazon, good job its a good way to start.  Now spend a little extra and get something much better.  I'll wite up more at 6 months after bottling as this one will keep for a couple of years or longer in the bottle.

review/text: This is the third of these kits that I have made to fill the rack while the other homebrews finish.  I am impressed.  I made this one and cut it back a bit, about 5 gallons.  It was easy, fun, and it turned out just fine. Color is deep and pretty, no filtering, and it is a great little something to pull off the rack for that spur of the moment grill out, or for that evening glass. The taste is a bit lighter than a $15 bottle of wine, but for the price it is truely drinkable. I would put it between a cab and merlot in finish.  I let mine age a bit in the carboy before bottle, and it just got better.  For the novice, and for a good cheapie to grab out when you need it, perfect!  For the price, it's a pretty good deal.

review/summary: Excellent Matcha for Beginners!
review/text: There are so many good things to say about this matcha as well as this company.  Let's start with how awesome Red Leaf Tea is.<br /><br />The customer service is prompt and friendly.  They listen to your suggestions and opinions and take action to please their customers.  It's a sad world when decent customer service is a novelty, but Red Leaf Tea brings some joy back into a bleak world with their courtesy.  Thank you, Red Leaf Tea!<br /><br />Now, this matcha...it's great for beginners!  The price is perfect and you get a good amount of tea so you can experiment with  how you like to drink it.  The basic flavors here are sweet, green and minerally.  THe texture is pretty smooth with only a hint of a powdery texture.  It's a pleasing beverage hot, prepared in the traditional way.  Yes, the quality isn't the best, but it is definitely a good introduction.  It is not bitter at all and completely inoffensive.  I used to be scared of preparing my own matcha because the one time I did it before Red Leaf, it was with a horrible matcha that was extremely bitter.  Now I make myself matcha drinks all the time!<br /><br />After trying this tea the traditional way to fully appreciate the flavors you're working with, you can use the powder to add flavor and healthiness to pretty much anything!  Like the Starbucks green tea latte?  Now you can make your own at a fraction of the cost!  Breakfast smoothie need a healthy caffeine kick?  BAM! Starter Matcha to the rescue!  Want some green tea cookies to go with your green tea latte?  You know where I'm going with this.  :)<br /><br />My favorite way to have this matcha right now is to add it to my Almond milk, banana smoothie.  It was also awesome in my amaretti cookies.  :)<br /><br />Conclusion?  Highly recommended!

Needless to say, I am always scrounging for healthy ways to get him to eat more things.  He adores these, and I am thrilled because they managed to squeeze in a whole load of veggies that I couldn't arm wrestle him into eating.  They are virtually impossible to find in the mega-sized city where I live, even in Whole Foods stores and the like.  My Target store attempts to stock them and can't even keep them in stock, as apparently other kids like them as much as mine. I'm so excited to stock the freezer so that I will have these on hand for every time I can't get him to eat more than a tiny fistful of goldfish crackers!

review/summary: Too much sauce again
review/text: The Hormel Compleats that contain sauce always contain a lot more of it than the picture on the packaging suggests.  This variety is no exception.  The picture is very misleading and suggests a much more solid meal than you get.<br /><br />The ravioli are thin and underfilled.  The marinara sauce has an unusually strong flavor, one which may or may not be to your personal liking.  I disliked it mostly because I found it distinctly sweet (the ingredients include sugar and high fructose corn syrup).  As it also contains vinegar, the taste is reminiscent of a Chinese sweet and sour sauce.<br /><br />If you are looking for a convenient, very light snack with a strong and unusual taste, you might give this a try, but I would want less sugar in the sauce and more filling in the ravioli before I tried it again.

review/summary: SPLENDA Alert
review/text: I was VERY disappointed in the Chai Tea Latte.  I was very excited to try it and after brewing my first cup the smell was of a wonderful creamy pumpkin pie.  But after my first sip I knew there was something horribly wrong.  Sure enough I realized I should have looked at the ingredients before spending $9.  The chai tea disk contains Splenda (sucralose) which to those of us who can't stand the stuff, and can detect it in any food no matter how subtle the metallic aftertaste, was a HUGE disappointment.  It makes no sense to me why the makers would use Splenda to sweeten the chai tea when the latte creamer includes sugar already.  So if you like or don't mind Splenda you will probably really enjoy this.  On the other hand if you are sensitive to it your first cup may also be your last, as mine was.  :(

review/summary: Splenda - What a horrible idea
review/text: This drink should get ZERO stars.<br /><br />My husband and I recently purchased the Tassimo Suprema machine.  We mainly drink cappuccinos, but we were excited about some of the other drink options.  To add variety to our selection, we tried the Twinings Chai Latte T discs.  I was the first one to taste the chai latte.  I looked at my husband immediately and remarked, "It tastes like it has Splenda in it!" We were both incredulous at first, but then he tasted it as well.  It did taste like it had Splenda.  I took the packaging out of the garbage and read the ingredients of the Twinings Chai Latte.  To our very severe disappointment, the very last ingredient was sucralose.  My husband and I detest Splenda - it has an awful aftertaste and it gives us headaches.  We are extremely disappointed that Tassimo/Twinings decided to put Splenda in the Chai Latte recipe. We did not purchase our Tassimo system because we wanted low calorie drinks - and if the product contains Splenda IT SHOULD CLEARLY SAY SO ON THE PACKAGE. Furthermore, we are perplexed why, if this one product contains Splenda, there is no other Chai latte option.  Why in the world would someone want to spoil the wonderful taste of Chai with a manufactured sugar substitute like Splenda?  If customers ASK for a low calorie substitute, it should definitely be made available.  But why make your only version "low calorie?"<br /><br />We cannot bring ourselves to finish the rest of the package that we purchased - it tastes so awful. We're very disappointed that the money we spent on the package of Chai Latte T discs was wasted.  If we had seen on the packaging that it contained Splenda we would not have purchased it - we automatically assume that the sweetener is not artificial unless the label indicates otherwise - all customers do.<br /><br />Of course, if you don't mind the taste of Splenda then you might really enjoy this drink.  Otherwise, spend your money on something else - and make sure you read the ingredients before you buy it!

review/text: I am a BIG fan of Starbucks and CoffeeBean's Chai Tea Latte.  And was so excited to buy this product hoping that it would replace my $4 habit.  But I was dissapointed.  Another reviewer that gave it a good rating stated that "it smells wonderful...tasting like a liquid pumpkin pie...Sweet, creamy and somewhat spicy".  Well, it is sweet and creamy but not spicy like my favorite Chai Tea Latte.  It just doesn't even come close to that taste...but I have convinced myself that even though I'm giving up on the taste, I'm saving at least $3 per cup if not more.  And, yes, you can taste the splenda...and I can say that because I am a splenda fan.  Overall, I only gave it a three star because it's not a bad tasting item, but just not what I expected it to taste.  Maybe the wonderful aroma alone could satisfy you...

review/summary: Best Chai Latte you can make at home!
review/text: Delicious and invigorating. For those who want something more than a regular cup of coffee. Yes, this is made with a bit of splenda. I, personally, prefer this and, as far as the sweetness goes, it is made with very little splenda - it is not overly sweet (for those of us that don't like sweet things), but sugar/sweetener can be added for those who do like it. Chai tea is a delicious drink and the tassimo chai latte is definitely the best chai you could make at home in 30 seconds. Far better tasting and far better for you than the boxed or powder versions!

review/summary: Pretty good tea!
review/text: I really like the Twinings Chai tea, whether I drink it hot or iced, pretty good. If you ice it, brew,pour in glass,put in fridge until chilled, then add the ice. I make a double batch,chill and keep extra on hand. If you ice it hot,the ice melts and dilutes the tea too much. Also, do not use fridge ice, yuk; I always use clear ice I buy at our local convenience store, makes the tea taste so much cleaner. I say buy and enjoy, hope you all agree.

review/text: Bought the Tassimo for the wife mainly since I'm not a huge coffee drinker unless it's sweetened/creamed beyond recognition.  I've had chai before and jumped at them when I saw them at Bed,Bath&Beyond this past weekend. Makes a fantastic chai latte and I'm glad now I can order online since up til now I hadn't seen Chai available yet.

review/summary: Quantity misleading, taste icky
review/text: First off, the Amazon descriptions make it sound like you're getting 16 servings in a pack, and tho veterans know a package is only really 8 servings, newbies may not. Then they sell it as a "Pack of 2." Does that mean you get two packages with 8 servings (1 tea plus 1 milk) each?<br /><br />Then the chai itself...It's the worst-tasting chai I've ever had, and I've had some doozies. If they're selling other Starbucks stuff, why not Tazo Chai? It's too sweet, too, but the spices are vivid enough to overcome the sweetness. The Twinings stuff is just too weak. And why can't they just leave the sweetener out of the tea part altogether? Avoid the Splenda issue completely.<br /><br />I thought that going with the Tassimo would give me stronger coffee than the Keurig makes. Didn't realize there'd only be one chai choice and it would suck. Fool me once, shame on me.

review/summary: Very Disappointed, Odd Taste
review/text: One of the reasons that I bought the Tassimo system was so that I would be able to get the Chai Tea Latte taste at home without paying 4 bucks a cup.  I am a big fan of the Tazo liquid Chai mixes that I have used in the past.  I was a little bit nervous about the Twinings Chai, but since it was well reviewed I thought I was pretty safe.<br /><br />OK, so, I was wrong.  It appears that this product appears to be in the "love it or hate it" category.  I'm in the latter category.  The taste, and to a lesser extent smell of this product just isn't right.  Some of it may have to do with the Splenda, it clearly has an odd aftertaste that I don't associate with Chai.  I have had Chai in coffe shops large and small, but this is a taste I'm never quite experienced.  I'm not sure why or what the funkiness is, but I don't like it.  I'm probably going to have to throw out the second box: this is that objectionable.  I'm hoping that Tazo or Starbucks comes in and gives it a go, because not having Chai Tea Latte with my Tassimo is a large bummer.  In the mean time I'll go back to using the liquid Tazo mix, when I can find it.

review/summary: BUYER BEWARE. misleading info
review/text: Love the Chai tea taste. Love the ease of use of my Tassimo unit. But read the fine print closely. For every chai tea disc you get you are also receiving (and paying for) a disc of milk/creamer/watered down blegggh. A package of 16 actually means: 8 teas and 8 creamers. It would be worth the money for 16 tea discs alone-- and let you add your own creamer. But Tassimos' creamers are watered-down throw-aways. I have a cabinet full of unused Tassimo creamers (that come with their teas/lattes/cappucinos). It's almost enough to make me stow away my Tassimo coffeemaker. Instead, I order ONLY the coffees that do not come with the nasty milk/foam/creamer. Now... what to do with 11 boxes (times 4 per box) of this... stuff?

review/summary: NOT THE BEST BUT IT'S GOOD!
review/text: It's a nice cup of chai...is it the best or does it taste like what you get from Starbucks or other coffee/tea houses, No... but if you are looking for decent "copy-cat", than this is it! Yes, there is an artificial sweetner that is used in it, so if you are sensitive to that or just don't like the taste (I would say it mimicks the taste of Equal more than Splenda) of the fake sweetners than this tea is NOT for you. The spices are on point and the addition of either the milk disc or your own half and half makes it even more delicious! I use the fat-free milk discs that come with the Skinny Cappuccinos and it is perfect! If I want something a little richer, than I use a regualr milk disc or add my own half and half.

review/text: I used to love drinking this chai tea. I thought it was a good blend of sweet and spice to create the great chai taste. However lately when I have drank it, it tastes too artificial to me. Perhaps its the Splenda in it which once warmed up makes it taste this way. I'm not too sure but the fact it uses Splenda now is a big turn-off to begin with.<br /><br />I wish the taste had never changed since I was a loyal drinker of it. Now? Not so much and not at this price!

review/summary: Fairly Decent Flavor
review/text: If you don't send water through the same tea disc a 2nd time, and don't add sugar, you will taste too much nutmeg over a cheap assam or green tea (which tastes like dirt). I also squirted some light whip cream in it and over it. After trying the undrinkable Gevalia cappaccino, I was relieved to find something I liked. The creamer isn't bad in this one. I don't know if it's a different kind or if it is a good combination of seasoning. I gave it 3 stars because for this price, Twinings should have used a better grade of tea. It tastes pretty good now, but there is still that lingering aftertaste of earthy tea. With the milk, it fills my insulated glass 3/4 of the way full. One other feature, it smells wonderful brewing! It IS Thanksgiving in a cup (thermal glass, I mean.) As a price comparison, using the 20% coupon at Bed, Bath, & Beyond, who sells it for $10.99, regularly, for the 16 disc (8 servings) pkg. and with their free standard shipping, it comes to $1.09 per serving before tax.

review/summary: Ripoff alert
review/text: First off, the Twinings Chai Latte's are probably the best drink that the Tassimo can make IMHO.  I typically pick them up at the local BB&B ($10.99 for 8 servings about $1.37/cup, and just now found out that they have free shipping :))<br /><br />My issue here is with this specific item.  It lists "Includes 2 packs of 16 servings each!" which would make the price of $32.99 a decent deal for 32 servings ($1.03 per cup).  I guess thats the benefit of buying in bulk.<br /><br />But then, the package arrived this morning.  In the package is two 8 serving packs.  Now, it is important to note that with any Tassimo Lattes, there are two T-Disks needed for each serving.  1 is the milk and the other is the espresso or tea.  So there are 16 T-Disks in each package but only 8 servings.  Everywhere else on the planet, it will cost you between $1.00 and $1.37 per serving.  Here, it will cost you twice that much.  Total false advertising and complete ripoff.  Guess I'm going to find out how Amazon's return policy works.

review/text: The product description says, "Includes 2 packs of 16 servings each!" but this is absolutely not true.  You get 2 packs of 8 servings each.  I would not have bought this version of the product if it had been labeled correctly, because it costs significantly more than the truthfully labeled 2 packs of 8 servings each.  I am going to ask Amazon to make up the price difference, or allow me to return it for no charge.

review/text: Let me say first that I use and like Splenda so I am not unhappy that it is in this chai latte drink. And I drink a lot of chai teas at coffee shops as I'm a non coffee drinker married to a coffee fiend. I found the Twinings Chai Latte for the Tassimo to be excellent and now have one every morning. It is sweet, so beware of that. Unfortunately, my teenage son and his pals recently tried the chai lattes and now they, too, are fans. So, I am hiding my stash.  The per cup cost is high, but still cheaper than what I pay at Starbucks. It's also not easy to find as my local Target carries coffee products for the Tassimo, but not the chai tea, requiring that I either drive to Bed, Bath and Beyond or order online.

My husband doesn't mind Splenda, but found the chai excessively sweet, overpowering any spicy flavor.  I don't understand why they'd pre-sweeten the drink anyway -- unlike milk it's not like it's hard to store sugar or Splenda or whatever, and allow people to doctor their own drinks to their chosen sweetness.  The chai does smell nice.

review/summary: very good substitute
review/text: For the real chai, that is.  Which is not latte (i.e. not foamed).  I much prefer my own homemade chai, but this is a very good substitute for a quick cuppa.  I detest the chai powders which are disgustingly sweet.  The only manufactured chai that I like was the Tazo chai concentrate (Starbucks uses Tazo), but they changed their formula last year and I don't like the new stuff.  When I bought the Tassimo, one of the requirements was that it HAD to make chai latte.  The Twinings Chai Latte is pretty durned good for a quick brew cuppa.  Yes, it is a bit sweet, but so are all the other chai's out there.  Tazo is sweet too.  This chai latte is actually finitely tuned so that you can actually taste the tea in it.  The creamer is not overpowering.  My only complaint is that when I drink chai, I like a grande.  Not the 10 oz mug you get with these disks.  So I often find myself brewing 2 cups (4 disks total including creamers) to satisfy my craving.  If Tazo were to go back to its old formula, I would probably prefer it because of strong ginger flavour.  However, at the moment, this is the closest second, to my own home brew, that I can get.

review/summary: O-Ring Failure!!  Great taste but tea leaves don't stay in the disc
review/text: I've purchased this product several time before, and never had this problem.<br />I currently am working on my first batch of a 2 pack shipment, so I'm hoping this problem doesn't continue.<br />The first 3 discs were ok, but the last 2 cups have had the tea leaves come out of the disc and into my cup.<br />The first time it happened I figured it out by getting a mouthful of them.  The second time, I watched the machine closely, and examined the disc afterward.  Seems like there is a production problem with the discs.<br />The disc gets very bloated, and the inside seal that keeps the contents inside, seems to fail.<br />I made some regular coffee immediately afterward, and didn't have any grounds seep out, so I think the problem is unique to these discs.  These are too expensive to have this happen even on one or two.<br />The product tastes WONDERFUL, but this problem is too serious too risk continued purchase of these.

review/summary: Good tea but disappointed
review/text: I read all the other reviews and have not seen anybody else experiencing the problem that I am having.<br /><br />Overall the tea is very good, but sometimes when I make it, the crushed up tea leaves end up in my cup.  I don't have this problem with any of the other products and the machine is always cleaned after every use.<br /><br />So I would not buy this product again, because of the problem I am having with it.

review/text: I love my Tassimo teas.  The Chi Tea is very good. We are coffee and tea drinkers and this works well for both without having your tea taste like coffee.

review/summary: I love Amazon, but this item is far too expensive considering . . .
review/text: This will probably be deleted by Amazon, as it probably should be.  I am addicted to Tassimo Chai Tea Latte.  I buy mine at Coffeecow.  I get 5 packages for 49.95/month and that is without tax or S & H.  They resend it the same time every month.  It is so easy.  Sorry Amazon, but your prices are just too high.<br />.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my money buying this product.  I agree with other reviewers that this has a VERY artificial sweetner taste to it. I love chai lattes from coffee places and was hoping that this could replace those, but definitely NOT.  If you don't like the taste of splenda, don't buy this product!!!

review/summary: disappointingly fake
review/text: i had pretty high hopes for this, i really like chai when i make it or at starbucks or something.<br />this one, the spices taste ok, not sure if they are completely natural or not, i would suspect<br />a mix of natural and artificial ingredients, but i'm not sure.<br />what i am sure of, is that it is very very sweet for my taste, and has that sickly too-sweet splenda taste to it.<br />i understand that splenda is better than aspartame but i'm not a fan

review/summary: Nasty Sweeeeet
review/text: Like others I found this way too sweet with a nasty aftertaste presumably due to the sucralose -- initially I didn't know it was in there but it was immediately obvious from the first taste. I gave this two stars instead of one because I think the other flavors are basically pretty good but it's almost impossible to tolerate the aftertaste. To make it more drinkable I run a lot of extra water through (the spices hold up). But it's still basically nasty. There seems to be plenty of space in the disc, I think they could fit more real sugar in if needed. I don't expect to buy this again unless they change the recipe.

review/summary: Funny aftertaste
review/text: I had high hopes for this product, but they were dashed when the after taste hit.  Splenda.  The spices and flavor of the Chai itself are really satisfying but the lingering residue of the Splenda takes away any benefit from the blend.

review/summary: Sucralose, what a shame
review/text: I was quite excited when I ordered this product because chai is one of my favourite hot drinks.  However, upon my first sip almost all I could taste was the Sucralose.  It was like licking a metal pipe with spices sprinkled on it.  I hadn't paid attention to the ingredients prior to that point but the use of Sucralose was obvious.  If you're sensitive to artificial sweeteners, like Sucralose, you probably won't like this product.  Otherwise, it seems like it has potential.  I might have liked it if it didn't use artificial sweeteners but as it is I won't buy this product again.

review/summary: Hot Very Hot
review/text: I love Demetris regular and extra horseradsih, but the Chipotle is really hot. I like hot food, wings etc but this was just too hot alone.  Now I use the extra horseradish mix and put a dash of this in too kick it up. But be warned, this is really hot
