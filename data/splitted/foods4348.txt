review/summary: Great Hot Chocolate
review/text: Ghirardelli Hot Chocolate Mix-Double Chocolate is the best.  I bought some locally awhile back but I can't find it anywhere locally now, so I have to order it online.  I received the shipment in a couple of days and was able to give it as a Christmas gift.  As far as I'm concerned it doesn't get any better than Ghirardelli's.

review/summary: The best hot cocoa for those cool evenings by the fire
review/text: This is by far the best hot chocolate you can buy.  We are not big coffee drinkers and have tried all of the powders that you mix with water.  We finally gave up on those and started using Nestles Quik in hot milk or just making our own cocoa from scratch with the Hershey's cocoa.  Homemade is always the way to go when you have a crowd, but it takes a lot of time and you have to worry about burning it.<br /><br />When we discovered the Ghirardelli, we will never go back to Quik or try any of the powders.  The Double Chocolate has all the flavor or homemade without all the work.  My daughter-in-law likes the white chocolate mocha flavor and thinks it is better than Starbucks.<br /><br />The beauty of the Ghirardelli's cocoa is that you don't have to spend more than two minutes heating a cup of milk in the microwave.  We usually heat enough milk in a large pyrex measuring cup for the two of us, then we pour the hot milk into the cups, on top of the two heaping teaspoons of the cocoa mix.  It's great with a little whipped cream on the top.<br /><br />World Market sells the product for $4.99 a canister, but I have found it there on sale for $4.00, so Amazon does not have the best price.  It is very hard to find, if you don't have a World Market nearby, so Amazon may be the way to go.

review/text: I've been craving a good cup of cocoa/hot chocolate for weeks.  I finally broke down and went to the little drive-thru coffee business (not to be named) that claims to have the best around.  It had a chemical taste like it came from a mix with artificial flavorings - for only $2.75!  While at my sister's house after an outdoor event, she warmed us up with the best hot chocolate drink I've ever had! Found out it was Ghirardelli's Double Chocolate Hot Chocolate Mix....I'm a believer.  Everyone in my family is getting some for Christmas!

review/summary: REAL HOT CHOCOLATE!!
review/text: Maybe to some it is a little sweet. I think it is perfectly sweetened to my taste. And I usually do not like too sweet desserts. Go figure. Must add milk. Therefore the majority of the flavor comes from actual chocolate. I spoil myself with this stuff in the cold months. Kind of like a fine wine in a hot chocolate kind of way..for those who know what waiting all day for that glass of wine means. Nothing I have found comes close and like a wine I like..  Once I found this one..I would compare all of the others to this anyway.

review/text: This Ghirardelli Double Chocolate mix is absolutely a Godsend! For someone who is lactose-intolerant like me, it was almost impossible trying to find a hot chocolate mix that didn't already have some sort of powdered milk in it. This mix does not. You add it to your own hot milk (in my case, the lactose-free Lactaid brand milk.) I actually also tried it in just hot water and it was still good. It is thick, rich, not too sweet and wonderful! I am thrilled that I can enjoy hot chocolate again. Thank you Ghirardelli! Two thumbs up!!!

review/summary: Impossible to find French Vanilla anywhere but Amazon
review/text: First off, there are only 8 packets per box - not 10 (as stated by Amazon).  I knew that when purchasing, but others may not.  That said, I am so happy to be able to get the No Sugar Added Carnation Instant Breakfast in French Vanilla from Amazon.  I use 2 to 4 packets per day to feed my son and it has really helped pack the weight on him (I mix the CIB with heavy cream, not milk - HUGE caloric difference).  And with the French Vanilla flavor, I'm free to add anything else to the mixture to flavor it for him (usually SF jello pudding or SF Tang to give it a orange creamsicle flavor, which he loves).

review/summary: A nod to nostalgia with a capital "N" - yay!
review/text: Not only do these bring back memories but as I've gotten older, I've realized that they not only have that great cinnamon taste but that they are actually useful (after all, they are toothpicks). Not only are they great for a last minute touch up before going out in public, getting stubborn pieces of food from between the teeth, but they sweeten the breath. They are far above the average, run of the mill toothpick.<br /><br />  Back in high school,  they were used by some of my friends as "weight loss aids" (spicy but with no calories). Also, there was the added allure of mild risk, courting the disapproval of adults (they were actually banned in my school, probably by fearful administators who had visions of kids falling while running and getting injured by the sharp points). Parents cautioned us not to "Drive with one of those in your mouth" . They were right but we did, anyway...hey, we were teens.<br /><br />  But I digress....this is one time when taking a trip down memory lane is worth the price.

review/summary: Great classic "candy" - great price - worth the buy!
review/text: I've been a fan of these little things since I first discovered them on the local ice cream truck when I was a little kid.  Since then, cinnamon toothpicks have gone in and out of fashion, and it wasn't until a couple years ago that this specific brand came back on the market... and oh, was I happy to see it back!<br /><br />While many of the 40-50 year old set fondly remember soaking toothpicks in cinnamon oil (the "old fashioned way"), those in the 30-something set fondly remember buying pack after pack of these ready-to-enjoy treats.  They taste fantastic - cinnamon with just a hint of sweetness - and are great to suck or chew on when you're on the computer, stuck in rush-hour traffic, or simply between meals and without a snack.  Plus, well, they're toothpicks, so you can use them after meals and enjoy the nice, cinnamony flavor.<br /><br />Each packet contains somewhere around 10-12 picks, and they don't go bad when the pack is opened, unlike so many other candies.  Plus, they have no calorie content and no food content, so while you get the flavor, you aren't gaining the pounds.<br /><br />All in all, they're a great thing to have around, regardless of the time of year... but given when I'm writing this specific review, I'd also like to add that they make great stocking-stuffers, or a great gift for the cinnamon-lover in your life.

review/summary: The Original !!!
review/text: Old School cinnamon toothpics in bulk quantity, Yay!  The concept is simple but effective--These are made of a wood slightly softer (and much more absorbant) than the regular plain boxes of round toothpicks, and soaked in STRONG cinnamon oil.  The resulting flavor is VERY strong cinnamon often resulting in numb tongue/lips, DO NOT confuse these with those wimpy so-called "flavored" round toothpicks passed out in fancy-schmancy resteraunts.<br /><br />We used to buy these at the liquor store across from school in 5-piece packs (I lived in a terrific neighborhood).  I vividly remember chewing on these in High School during certain classes to stay awake.  For some reason, a toothpick was tolerated where gum or a tootsie pop was not.  The flavor was so good (STRONG) for so long, I would often end up chewing these things to a nice, woody pulp. MMMmmm!  Against my nature, I am going to resist commenting on cinnamon toothpicks as a source of dietary fiber.  For those saddled with droning teachers or co-workers, know that it is simply not possible to fall asleep with something as hot as these toothpicks in your mouth.  In college, I found them useful in finally breaking my nail biting habit.  Wood pulp, thankfully, is non-addictive.  Offer one to a non-suspecting friend and watch their eyes light up along with their tongue! :)

On the plus side, the cabinet or surrounding area you store them at will soon smell cinnamon fresh, too.  Air freshner included at no extra charge. These are authentic and original, and a great gift for yourself or a friend. A top "pick"! Individually wrapped, too!

review/text: As a kid growing up in the 70's, I remember cinnamon toothpicks that were very skinny pieces of wood individually wrapped in paper and quite flavorful.<br /><br />These toothpicks are not the same as the ones I remember but are still quite good in their own right.  These toothpicks are much thicker/sturdier and also hotter.  They come in plastic containers of 75 each.  Think of a short, stout toothpick crossed with a touch of Atomic Fireball, and that is what you are getting with these.

review/summary: Cinnamonotonous Tootpicks
review/text: Toothpicks really make me sentimental. I remember well my first toothpick, "Gabriel." An admirable piece of wood, so graceful in the ways of dislodging food from between ones teeth, his dance like the effortless grace of a Darcey Bussell. Alas, I was but a child and misused Gabriel, splintering him on an unprincipled frog bone snagged between my first and second premolars. I will never forget Gabriel. On the someteenth anniversary of his removal of a very recalcitrant pomegranate seed I decided to peruse Amazon for a replacement. I was suprised at the results.<br /><br />This product advertises itself as "low-in-fat, high-in-taste." This is marvellous because I am on a diet. A good majority of us lack the digestive enzymes necessary to process wood. Although, my colleague Gareth Mitchell Headgraves is a rarity. I admit I become anxious when I leave himself alone in a room with a good piece of teak. In any case, despite a few misguided efforts, I cannot digest wood and will reaffirm that for most of us this product is low in fat.<br /><br />After trying this product I became intruiged by a fellow reviewer's suggestion to try making your own home brew cinammon sticks. His have been brewing for 29 years. This engorged my curiousity. What flavours could I impregnate a toothpick with? Could I try a sweet Canary wine? Or a supple juniper extract? Perhaps a melegueta pepper?<br /><br />3 stars because this product only opened up my curiousity for new toothpick flavours, and now find cinnamon to be lacking.<br /><br />PS - fortunately for the parsimonious among us, Amazon has this item listed as used.

I have a bottle with toothpicks that have been there 10 years!

review/text: Every supermarket in our area was out of macadamia nuts, so we panicked and ordered through Amazon. Two days later, we had excellent macadamia nuts for our big luau. (You cannot hold a luau without them.) They are less salty than the usual supermarket brands, so the nut flavor really comes through.

review/summary: Contains sea salt!
review/text: So I ordered this item specifically because I am watching my salt intake and because I was running low on a salt-free chili powder I'd purchased at a specialty store when vacationing. So I did an Amazon search and right there in the product name were the words "salt free chili powder blend". Awesome, right? Wrong! Imagine my disappointment when I received the package, surveyed the ingredients list and found that "sea salt" was the second ingredient! What the, huh?? So I am waiting to hear whether Amazon will replace this item with one as advertised (no returns on this one since it is an "add-on item". Anybody want some salt-containing chili powder I'm not going to use?)<br /><br />What concerns me is that when I came back to this product page to see if others had encountered a similar problem, I clicked to enlarge the image of the package and sure enough, it's the very same package I received and "sea salt" is ingredient number 2!! Why advertise this product as "salt free" when nothing about it is salt free? I don't get it Amazon, I just don't get it.

review/summary: Don't listen to the naysayer - these are superb!
review/text: I don't know about the person who didn't care for these much and gave only one star - that person gave no reasons. So I can only imagine that they have an excessively sweet tooth and probably like a fatty taste - which is what you get with most of the other products out there that make their stuff just too downright sweet and frankly also use questionable ingredients as sweeteners<br /><br />I think Nana does a great job.  Now I think so does Pamela's kitchen, so it isn't the only game in town. But Pamela puts out a very different product.  One of the really good things about Nanas in addition to the fact I think it is really well done, is that they are individually wrapped, so nothing starts to go stale or dry out after the package is opened, and it is really easy to pack these things with lunch or to have as a snack during the day.  They can be a tad on the dry side - not too much but probably for some people.  So have tea or the like ready.

review/text: Initially, I thought these were pretty expensive cookies but I think they're totally worth the money! My daughters don't have food allergies but I do limit their sugar intake. I really like the face that these cookies are sweet only from juices and not refined sugar. We bought the chocolate chips and I think they taste just like any typical chocolate chip cookie. My very-picky four-year-old can't get enough. I only wish they were a bit cheaper but I understand that with quality ingredients, etc. comes a price tag so I'm willing to fork out the bucks for these yummy cookies.

review/summary: If you LOVE Chicken wing meat...
review/text: UPDATE June 2009: They changed the recipe so these are now more tender (good thing), but they got rid of the slight tangy vinegar flavor. Now they don't taste like chicken wings; just spicy chicken jerky. I will probably buy these about once a year now, instead of 1-2 times per month. Back to the Jalapeno jerky, when I can find it!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW from 11/29/08: I don't eat chicken wings that often any more (90 fat calories per wing, being deep fried and dipped in butter). And I LOVE chicken wings! But if the flavor you crave is that hot sauce & vinegar comingling with a large chunk of tender chicken, then give these a try. If you're looking for the butter, crispy or chewy skin, and deep fried flavor components, then you won't have those here. I don't buy beef jerky anymore (which is also a favorite), I buy these! I just wish they weren't so hard to find locally. Circle K and Walgreens are the only retail locations I know of. Eat 1 bag, and you'll be addicted or nonplussed. There's not really a middle road.

Expiration date is too close; received today, SEPT 9, 2011, expiring NOV 21, 2011.<br /><br />In the past, have had very good experience with the Chicken Teriyaki nuggets. Jack Link's used to use dark meat. Jack Link's changed the recipe to white meat and the nuggets do not taste as rich any more.<br /><br />*** Very disappointed with Amazon's approach on linking ALL Jack Link's nuggets together. Meaning: If you post a review for the Chicken Teriyaki ones, you can NOT post one for the flaming chicken, turkey over roasted, etc.?! And the same review will show up under any and all of them. I contacted Amazon and customer service first tried to convince me I was doing something wrong. On the third e-mail, the senior CS guru indicated the nugget products are all linked together and nothing will be done about the issue.

review/text: These are great!  They are spicy, but not too spicy.  They taste just like Buffalo Hot Wings but without the bones. I agree with another reviewer who is thinking about microwaving these as I bet these would taste even better warmed up!  I bought an 8 pack of these and keep these at my job for when I get the munchies and want some quick protein and the calories for one bag is only about 280 so that is perfect for a snack or to ward away the hunger pangs.  These would be great for someone doing a low-carb diet or someone who just wants extra protein for their body.  One bag also has just over 30 grams of protein and this tastes so much better than eating just a protein bar.  Bottom line is this... if you love hot wings and can't get enough give these a try.  You won't be disappointed.
