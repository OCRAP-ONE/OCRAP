review/text: This made our cat really sick, maybe we bought a spoiled batch, but we tried twice and both times his reaction was to puke soon afterward. Caused vomiting and diarrhea. Unfortunately we purchased multiple bags, which will just end up in the trash.

review/summary: This is an affordable and healthy cat food
review/text: The main ingredient of this food is chicken meal. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026M6RA2">Purina Cat Chow Dry Cat Food 16lb</a> and almost every other cat food on the market contains beef by products, which legally can include all sorts of things like roadkill and euthanized animals with their collars still on. This food contains poultry and no beef by products. Definitely a good choice.

review/summary: Both of my cats' favorite food!
review/text: I've tried at least ten different types of dry cat food. By far, my cats love Purina Naturals the best. They scarf down every morsel of this stuff and seem to always be eager for more. Other food has been left untouched all day or just pushed out of their dish onto the floor. But I never see them waste this cat food. I can also say that my cats have beautiful soft and shiny fur coats and that they don't seem to shed as much as other cats. With some of the other brands I tried, I would notice that the dye in the food would make its way into what I was cleaning out of the litter box. YUCK! That can't be healthy. My cats never seem to have any digestion problems with Purina Naturals. I tried switching them to a weight management food and they hated it. Back to their favorite. They can be fat and happy. YUM!

review/summary: Some good but still some bad ingredients
review/text: If you were feeding your cat poor quality food before and have switched to this you've probably seen some improvement, hence the positive reviews.  HOWEVER, please be aware that this food really isn't all that great.  Corn is the second AND sixth ingredient listed which means there is a lot of it!  It is used partially as a cheap protein source and a cheap filler.  Cats have no use for corn and cannot effectively digest it which can result in very stinky, large stools and some medical problems.  Corn is also a common allergen among cats.  Corn is not good for cats!  Brewer's rice is a by-product of beer production.  Basically it is nutritionally worthless.<br /><br />On the positive side there are no animal by-products in this food.  For those of you who don't know what animal by-products are I'll fill you in.  Animal by-products are the beaks, feathers, hooves, intestines, bones, etc. (basically the inedible parts of an animal) all ground up and served up for your cat to eat.<br /><br />I don't believe this food to be terrible but at the same time it isn't great either.  Remember that just because it's "natural" doesn't mean it's good!!  After having several of my cats (I have 16) develop hairloss and other related allergy and medical issues I have made it a point to thoroughly research any cat food I serve up.  Because I have so many, I need to be frugal but at the same time I also need to be responsible by choosing quality food products.  The information to make good food choices for your pet is out there, easy to find, and readily available.

review/summary: Can find it in stores for cheaper
review/text: The first 5 ingredients in this cat chow is chicken meal, corn gluten meal, soybean meal, brewers rice and animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols. It's necessary to steer clear of products that say that real meat is the first ingredient. Real meat is about 70% water, making the second ingredient the prominent ingredient. A meat meal should be the main ingredient as that does have a meat content. Corn gluten meal isn't corn, it's a residue left over from when they wash away all the starchy carbs from corn. It's very high in protein and is more like a by product of vegetable oil. Soybean meal is very nutritional and a great alternative to other buffers, like rice and corn. Brewers rice is not a by product of beer. That's ridiculous. It's a by product of milling whole rice, therefore has a considerable amount of nutrition. Animal fat with tocopherols is a great ingredient. Cats actually need quite a bit of fat and oils for proper nutrition and tocopherols is a vitamin that essential for them, yet most cat foods don't have.<br /><br />I buy a 15 lb bag of this at Walmart for $12, so I feel like this is a great product for the price. I'm surprised to see it at twice the price here. I've seen it at around $18 at pet stores even. My cat actually went from a better product to this. The reason being was the other product was very expensive and she went through it very quickly. She didn't have any hairloss or ill effects. People still come over and say how pretty she is. I was a bit taken aback by the colour of it, it's a yellow brown. Then I thought, they don't put dye in it, so I'm used to seeing brown pet food for a reason. This isn't the best cat food out there, but it's decent and is a great product for the price.

review/summary: Our Cat's Favorite Food
review/text: We have 5 older cats.  For years they were on a diet of Purina One but recently (within the past year), I've started adding Purina Naturals to the mix and they ALL just love it.  I can't seem to keep the bowl full!  I have a dish of purina One Chicken and Rice out now and they've all just ignored it, where they used to gobble it up - but that was BEFORE I started to buy the Naturals.  Great product - their coats are shiny and soft and eating the dry food has the added benefit of keeping their teeth healthy.  They've all had GREAT checkups.

review/summary: Naturals has been a real "treat" for my kitty
review/text: I had my cat on a blend of several different foods for their "main diet," but for "treat" purposes, I thought I would try another quality cat food to give him to add some variety to his diet. I chose Purina Naturals because it sounded like it had good, healthy ingredients. So I began to occasionally give my cat small amounts of Naturals as a treat, and he loved it. Actually, maybe loved it too much... since he liked it so much, the portions I gave him got bigger and bigger... and now he's overweight!<br /><br />But on the whole, I felt good giving my cat a "snack" that was nutritional and not just another "treat." And he didn't even know that it was good for him! I'm sure it's a great food for "main diet" purposes, too... that just wasn't my purpose. But I was very happy with it as a "snack." (It just took a looong time to get through the bag!)<br /><br />I have since started my cat and my new kitten on some wet food, so that has pretty much replaced my older cat's "dry treat" routine (he fills up on the wet food, so he doesn't want the dry treats much anymore). So I may not buy more Naturals for a while. But if my cat(s) ever get(s) in the mood again for dry treats, I will definitely keep Naturals in mind.

review/summary: The unanimous favorite among our cats
review/text: We always have a multi-cat household and barnhold, and this particular product from Purina has been everyone's favorite since it first came out.  Other dry foods, including hideously expensive "human quality" brands, hang around in the bowls or get picked through with resultant half-eaten bits scattered on the floor, but the Naturals gets cleaned up every time.  Its small pellets are edible by kittens and may also contribute to what seems to be a lower vomit rate among the adults.<br /><br />It's readily available locally, and is much less expensive that way, so that's where I actually buy it, but whichever way you need to obtain it, I think your cats will thank you for it.

review/summary: Fun and functional
review/text: I drink many kinds of loose teas, and this has worked great for all of them. Occasionally some small particles get through the small holes of the ceramic filter, but I think that it is probably not realistic to expect perfection on that front. The design is wonderfully functional and the mug is a nice large size. I agree with another reviewer that it would be nice if they offered more designs and colors, but really, that's a minor complaint. For the poster who was angry about their mug arriving broken, the same thing happened to me. I sent Amazon an e-mail and I had an unbroken mug set in my hands in two days, free of charge. They told me to dispose of the broken one, which I could not return because for hygienic reasons they cannot accept returned household goods like dishes. In brief, even with the slightly annoying hassle of initially receiving a broken item, it was well worth it. I plan to buy a second one!

review/summary: Good results but contains soy
review/text: I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.  I'm feeding this to my terrier as he tends to show the results to changes in his diet quicker than my Corgi or Belgian Sheepdog.  I've been a dog mom for more than 20 years, including participating in dog sports such as sled dog running, agility and dog shows.  Proper nutrition is vital to dogs' health and ability to participate in things they love to do.  While I currently don't do these activities with my dogs, I still am very picky about what they eat.<br /><br />When I received my BzzKit, a 4lb bag of Hill's Science Diet, Ideal Balance Dog Food, I checked the ingredients.  The first listed is chicken (good!) followed by brown rice and whole grain wheat (not as good as a meat ingredient, but better than it being corn).  Next is cracked pearl barley, soybean meal and chicken meal.  I have to admit I paused at the soybean meal.  In my experience, soy has not been a positive addition to dog food.  I find that foods that contain it result in looser stools of greater volume, and the dog's overall condition is not as high as one fed a food without soy.  It's an inexpensive ingredient that is associated with "filler" in the dog community.  I was curious to see how my terrier would handle and fare on this food. 3 stars for only one meat ingredient in the first 5 ingredients, and for the inclusion of soy.<br /><br />Rex, my terrier, became immediately interested when I opened the bag.  He was VERY anxious to see what was in there, so the smell must have been very enticing.  He's not a picky eater, so I anticipated he'd like the Ideal Balance, but didn't anticipate how eager he was to get it!  I slowly, over the course of days, switched him to Ideal Balance from his previous food (to reduce stomach upset from a diet change), and found he ate the Ideal Balance nuggets first before cleaning his bowl.  It may be because it was new and novel, but it may have been because he liked it better.  He's a dog...he couldn't tell me.  He seems to like it so much that I can even use Ideal Balance as a training treat.  5 Stars for taste.<br /><br />Rex has been eating Ideal Balance for a couple of weeks now.  It's not long enough for a complete picture of its impact on his condition, but long enough to get an idea of how it's going for him.<br /><br />His coat is very nice.  It was nice before, and I haven't seen any change in the coat condition.  The Ideal Balance diet is at least maintaining his coat in good condition.  We need more time to see the food's long term impact in Rex's coat.  4 stars for coat maintenance.<br /><br />Rex has a tendency to gain weight.  We really have to watch how much he eats.  And Ideal Balance helps him pack it on!  This means I can feed him less, which means I'm buying less food in the long run.  But I really have to watch his weight.  And it means that he is getting a lot out of the food.  The crude protein is 21.5% and crude fat is 12.5%.  The protein is not high, but the fat content is maybe a little higher than I'd seek for him.  I might choose a weight control version of Ideal Balance if this becomes his regular diet (and if one exists).  5 stars for body weight maintenance.<br /><br />Now the down and dirty part of the review...stools.  A dog's stool can tell you a lot about how he is tolerating his diet.  Rex's stools on Ideal Balance are firm, maybe a little larger than they were on his previous food, and do not smell any more objectionable than normal.  This tells me he is digesting the food normally, as well as close to optimally.  They could be a little smaller, but not so much that if I wasn't looking for a change that I'd have necessarily noticed it.  5 stars for stool quality.<br /><br />Overall, I give Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food 4 stars.  If there were a 2nd meat source and/or soy wasn't present, I could in good faith give it 5 stars, based on Rex's condition on the diet.  If you do try it, be sure to monitor your dog's weight, and adjust how much you feed accordingly.

review/text: I tried this food for free through BzzAgent. My dog is about a year old but VERY active, so have him on puppy food still because he's smallish and has trouble keeping weight on. He is allergic to something, I'm not sure if it's environmental or food, but he didn't have a reaction to this food. This is corn-free so I'm wondering if that's what he's allergic to.<br />He did very well on it, and had nice solid stools and wasn't excessively flaky or itchy. He tends to bolt his food so the very small pieces weren't that great. He wouldn't chew it and then ended up vomiting afterward; I had to give him small amounts at a time. I'd rather they had kibble size options, but I'm being picky now.<br />I'm not thrilled that the second ingredient is wheat, but at least it's not corn. Sagan seemed to do well on it. If it was less expensive than the food I have him on now (that he also does very well on), I'd have no problem using or recommending this food.

review/summary: Doesn't Have Unpleasant Odor
review/text: If you've bought the new formula of Hill's Science Diet dog food, you may have noticed an extreme fragrance.  It is unpleasant to humans, but the dogs seem to like it (if you get my drift--think, "base of a fire hydrant").  This is unnecessary because the dogs liked it before and it had a tolerable dog food odor for humans to smell.  The new stuff is odiferous in a disgusting way.  I don't want that fragrance in my house, let alone the kitchen, which is where the dogs eat.<br /><br />This new stuff is probably the same as the old stuff only now you get less of it and it costs more.  Sigh.  So you pay more for less food, but at least it isn't stinky.  The dogs like it just as much as they did before.<br /><br />I hope Amazon will begin to carry this product in the large size.  We have two "mature" labs, so we will always need a supply of this food.  The local pet store isn't open 24 hours and doesn't always have what we want.<br /><br />This would be a terrific item for "Subscribe and Save".

review/summary: Better Ingredients But More Room For Improvement
review/text: I received a sample bag as a BzzAgent. I should first say that both of my dogs LOVED this food. They gobbled it up and didn't have any problems with digestion or itching, etc. I was happy to see that the first ingredient was real chicken. You can also compare your current dog food with Ideal Balance on this handy chart located here: [..] I am excited that the first ingredient is real chicken but I wish this product did not also contain chicken meal.

review/summary: Food You Can Feel Great About Feeding Your Dog
review/text: I have a 8.5 year old Jack Russell who I view as one of my 'children' and not just a dog. She is very food motivated and we're yet to find a dog food she won't eat, however, she's struggled with acid reflux issues and all night 'hiccups' for most of her life. So I was excited for the opportunity to try HIlls Science Diet Ideal Dog Food to see if it would help her with this issue. I am also very pleased to be feeding her food with NATURAL and REAL MEAT ingredients as it makes me feel better about what she's taking in and the quality of the food. Not surprisingly she took to the food right away. I've never been one to like the smell of dog food, but I certainly didn't find the smell to be any more offensive than any other food like the other reviewer mentioned. I actually placed out a piece of 3 different types of food in front of my dog and she immediately whe went for the Hills Science Diet Ideal Balance food, so I'm guessing that she found it to be more appealing too. Although I haven't seen a HUGE improvement on her reflux issue, it has seemed to helped a bit and I'll take any help I can at this point. In fact, she's only been on the diet a few weeks now, and I know it generally takes a bit longer for it's full effects, so I'm very optimistic that it will provide even more improvement in the future. The only negatives I have about the food are that I had a hard time opening the bag and the top actually ripped open so I wasn't able to use the reasealable closure (but that could've been due to my impatience), and it seems to be a bit pricey. BUT, it's worth it for the quality and if it helps. Definitely would recommend! I am a buzzagent and did receive a free 4 lb bag and coupons to try the product.

review/text: I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.<br />My small Pomeranian has allergies to a lot of things including wheat so he was itchy on this food, however, the lab I have did GREAT on this food.<br />She loved the taste, ate it very well, and I noted an improvement in her skin and coat. She also has itchy problems for a lot of the year but improved with the use of this food.<br />I also noted that my girl seemed to need less of this than most other brands of dog food out there. This means I'm buying less food in the long run which makes the food comparable in price to less healthy alternatives.<br />The only complaints I have is the use of the wheat ingredient plus the soy. I really would like to see this product use another protein source that is more within the natural diet of a canine.

review/summary: I love this mix!  Just the right combination!
review/text: A friend of mine turned me on this product - usually bought from WMart.  Amazon's price is very competitive and you probably don't have tax and no shipping.  I usually eat this snack each day or every other day - so I'm glad Amazon offers this 6-pack.<br /><br />This product has a wide array of nuts...just enough raisins and chocolate chips.  Some products will put too many raisins to fill the container - but not this product.<br /><br />The individual nuts can come from various countries - and it is listed on the back of the package in case you are interested.<br /><br />The pouch is a resealable 7 oz pouch that you can tuck in to your computer bag or purse.<br /><br />I have not tried any other "organic" trail mix to compare against, but compared against non-organic - I love this stuff!<br /><br />Update:  I have found that the Sunflower seeds tend to end up at the bottom of the bag if you don't mix it up real good or dig down when grabbing a handful.  I don't "think" they put too many in there, I just think its the way the bag shakes out.

review/text: I figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be - this is it.  If you are of a 'certain age' (over 40 or 50?) you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon; this cannot be found in "store bacon" anymore.  Modern bacon is thin, lightly/poorly smoked - even the so-called 'gourmet' bacon.  This is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the "good old days."  Arrives nice and cool in an ice pack - cheaper if you buy the 12-pack.

review/text: When I purchased a pink china tea set for my granddaughter, I got a few Davidson's Children's Tea Bags, and they were so perfect I did a little research and discovered that Amazon was the best place to buy more. This tea brews up pink, and because it is herbal, has no caffeine for little ones. Be aware that the tea bags do not contain as much tea as a regular bag, so they are perfect for a child's tea set.  My granddaughter was enchanted with this tea, and I must say, after dozens of tea parties, it is tasty tea, too.

review/summary: Unexpectedly flat taste (in a dented can)
review/text: Usually, organic food tastes sweeter and is more tender than food with preservatives and bug spray in them.  This lot of Westbrae organic corn I bought from Amazon tasted oddly flat:  very little flavor.  It may have had something to do with the cans having arrived dented, I don't know, or it was just a bad crop, or, who knows if it even was organic?  Disturbingly, the cans were lined with that white plastic that is so controversial.  Does the plastic contain endocrine disruptors that are in the news so much lately?  I don't know.  I probably wouldn't have even noticed if it hadn't been for the off-flavor.  I'm still open to buying organic canned produce, but I won't be ordering this one again.

review/summary: Caution, if you don't want a pocket full of powder!
review/text: I wish I had know that this product was changed in a very significant way. We were buying the freeze dried liver for training treats. It was real liver, diced into small pieces that were easy to transport and carry. The product now, with the misleading description of "ceter cut", is processed liver that has been stamped out. It is soft and extremely crumbly, and is reduced to powder in my pockets in no time. Comparison of the empty container with this new one showed no difference at all except for an adhesive label placed on the cover over the old one. I called the company to ask about the product change; the rep explained they changed the product to the processed one and said customer feedback indicates people don't like it. She said the regular, natural liver is still made, and is available at a national chain pet store, but not on Amazon. She kept apologizing, and was unable to explain to me why a correct description is not on the container; at this price, I would have appreciated a coupon toward the regular product at the pet store, since I have a 3/4 tub of the crumbly stuff that I can't use. I wish Amazon would carry the "old" product also, with an accurate description. Based on what she said, that is the product with the customer following.

review/text: Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.

The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom.

review/summary: Avid health nut here, and love this product!
review/text: Overview:  I used to work for Vitamin World and always wanted to try this product that was on the shelves, however, our employee discount didn't cover brands that weren't manufactured by us, so I never really gave it a shot.<br /><br />However, I recently just moved to college, and using RAW Meal has been a miracle.  With little money and little time for food preparation and shopping, I want something in a jiffy and something cheap.<br /><br />I know what you're thinking, this stuff is NOT cheap.  It's actually a good deal considering that you replace an entire meal (which could cost between 5 to 20 dollars if you eat out) with just a scoop of RAW Meal with a banana, ice, and some almond milk.  It fixes up in only 5 minutes total with my magic bullet with just a cup to wash afterwards, and the total cost is never over 2 dollars a pop.<br /><br />Another thing about being in college, I've been able to pay attention, focus, and study harder since I've started taking RAW Meal instead of eating the food available around my college campus.<br /><br />Flavor:  I was pleasantly surprised with this product.  I never mix this with only water, so no comment on that. When it first hits your tongue you might think it's a weird flavor, but as you continue to chug it down, the bad flavor goes away and you can taste the chocolate flavor.  This is in no way a chocolate milk shake from a diner though. I however do have two usual recipes for the chocolate RAW Meal: 1 scoop of RAW Meal Chocolate, 1 Banana, 4 ice cubes, quarter cup of almond milk, blend. OR, 1 scoop RAW Meal Chocolate, 1 Tablespoon PB2 or PB2 Chocolate, 4 ice cubes, quarter cup almond milk.  I also add whatever supplement I feel like having (inositol powder if I'm going to do a lot of homework, or BCAA/Glutamine/D-Ribose powder if I'm going to workout). For the vanilla RAW Meal, I do strawberries and bananas, oranges, and other fruits along with ice and almond milk.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Everything in here is raw and organic, and it's mostly sprouted grains. Because of the diversity of ingredients, you are getting high quality protein that includes all amino acids, unlike a lot of other protein powders that have lower quality protein content.<br /><br />Value: The original RAW Meal is only 28 dollars right now, while the Chocolate and Vanilla variants are 40 dollars... I would like to see Choco/Vanilla drop to 28 dollars as well... 'nuff said.<br /><br />I would recommend getting this if you truly plan on replacing a meal (or meals) with this.  If you still plan on eating 3 square full meals a day, then look for other superfood supplements -- this one is a meal replacement, and you're just adding too many calories if you want this as a snack.<br /><br />Overall: I would recommend this product.

review/summary: Exceeded all expectations
review/text: So I looked everywhere for reviews of the Cocoa flavored powder...it's still just hitting the shelves, so not many have ventured to try it yet.  I'm guessing because so many were disappointed by the taste of the original.  I never tried the original powder, because the reviews were too detrimental.  I knew I would hate it and didn't want to invest.  While this is not glass of chocolate milk, the dark chocolate flavor is what hits the taste buds first.  There is still the grass flavor...but I don't mind that taste.  It's lightly sweetened, but has only 11g of sugar per serving which is less than half of what's in the original powder.  34g of protein and loaded with vitamins and minerals.  I felt full after drinking 1/2 serving.  I only give  4 stars because it gets super duper thick within minutes which makes it hard to get down.  I bought the powder to be my meal on the go that I can carry all day and sip to keep my blood sugar and hunger under control.  Hard to do when it becomes a custard like consistency.  I read that adding more liquid does the trick.  But I mixed mine with almond/coconut milk and didn't have it on hand.  I will try to use water tomorrow.  Try the product.  It is worth it, completely bearable...and after a few days, might even be enjoyable.  Like a healthy chocolate treat!

review/text: My usual meal shake is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038B1EOY">Amazing Grass Amazing Meal, Organic Chocolate Infusion Powder, Gluten Free, 15 Servings, 17.1-Ounce Container</a> and the price has gone up a bit, so I've been looking for alternatives. I take the Amazing Grass Meal, 1 scoop, in ice cold milk and a spoonful of ovaltine to cover a slight grassy flavor, and it is delicious. Creamy and smooth. I don't guzzle it.<br /><br />This is not creamy, not smooth and not delicious. My first three RAM meal shakes increasingly had the consistency of, and tasted like, heavily sweetened vomit. This appears to be a common theme in RAW products. Keep reading - I did give this 5 stars after all!<br /><br />The problem was that I was treating this like the Amazing Grass, a nutritional treat to be enjoyed. I mixed 1 scoop of RAW (a half dose) with 10oz milk and ovaltine and drank it slowly. More unhappy with each dose, it took me longer to drink and it tasted worse and worse.<br /><br />So I changed tactics. 1 scoop, 8oz water, 1 tsp ovaltine for flavor, and GUZZLE. It actually tasted just fine - no sick or gross flavors or textures at all. The lumpy texture only happens when you let it sit and the chia seeds start thickening the liquid (ground chia and water make a vegan gelatin you can flavor just like jello). The bad taste only happens when you let it sit, and I don't know the cause. Use only thin liquids like water and apple juice and drink it as fast as you can swallow, and you discover that this really is a great health shake.<br /><br />The reasons for my 5 stars:<br />1. Great price<br />2. Long lasting energy<br />3. Really curbs the hunger pangs, better than the Amazing Grass<br /><br />If you want a meal shake that does the job without breaking the bank, you've found it. If you want a meal shake that you can savor and enjoy like a healthy treat, try the Amazing Grass.

Hides the strange flavor of the greens quite well and for me, it is the most palatable first thing in the morning!  Raw products are exceptional when it comes to quality and I received this product in 1 1/2 days thanks to Amazon prime.

review/summary: Let's talk taste...
review/text: I want to address a very undervalued and perhaps subjective requirement of a meal replacement powder, and that is 'taste'.  This product smells like pumpkin... bad pumpkin (surprisingly it has no pumpkin in it?).  It tastes like the soggy end of a bad pumpkin, and that's the chocolate version.  I love Spirutein chocolate drink, and this is not that, but I was looking for a meal replacement/diet aid.  I am not a vegan, and I mixed it with whole milk anticipating the flavor to be less than sublime, but even the milk did not help.  I surmise that this product is solely developed for vegans, as they tend to accept 'nasty' as a daily dietary requirement.  I shall endeavor to persevere with this product until the bottle is empty.  Perhaps I should mix it with Spirutein?  I think I'll go have some tea to help wash out the taste.<br /><br />October 9th 2012 Update ~<br />Well, I believe I have figured out how to make this product work.  I mixed one scoop of Raw Meal chocolate with 1 cup of whole milk and 1 cup of chocolate almond milk (I believe the flavor of the almond milk masks the product more than just milk).  I also added a banana and some frozen peach and blended.  I think the bare minimum for flavor tolerance is the chocolate almond milk.  That way you get the benefit of the raw meal, without having to gag.  It is a filling substitute, as I can go all day with just having the shake for breakfast and lunch, with fruit and veggies as a snack... and then a normal dinner... which is what makes me want to continue to use the product, because other diets leave one feeling starved!  It is also reasonably priced for what you get, which is overall a very high quality product (if the information on the packaging is true).

review/summary: RAW Chocolate Meal on Steroids
review/text: We try hard to eat the right things, as well as feed our four legged children. It's not cheap but we rarely get sick. Same with the dogs. I wanted to try the original RAW meal, well, not really. The reviews were horrid and knowing what I like my morning shake to taste like, chances were high I would not have used the product. When the Chocolate RAW meal came out, I figured we would try it.<br /><br />The first time Chocolate RAW was close to my mouth, I had my body all tensed up, my face was probably contorted, and my mind told me how bad this was going to taste. Kind of like when I was young and Mom wanted to give us her "special" cough medicine. Well, much to my surprise, this shake wasn't horrid. But to say that it tasted good would be a fib, at least straight up. The taste is different, with a somewhat grassy aftertaste and different shake consistency. There is no grittiness in the RAW Meal, like I found in the Garden of Life Proteins. I highly doubt I could have made myself a RAW meal shake (straight up out of the container) every morning. So here's what I did.<br /><br />Like others, I only use one scoop of RAW Meal. One scoop is plenty big (plus, one scoop is 50% larger than a normal protein scoop). Two scoops is a wicked overkill. If you need more than 17g of protein in your shake, add a half scoop of the Garden of Life protein. I find any more than one scoop makes this something I "have to force down" versus "something I really enjoy drinking." I only use 8 ounces of water. Any more than 8 ounces of water (with what I add into the shake) makes MORE THAN than two very large glasses to drink.<br /><br />I start with 3-4 ice cubes, chop them up in the blender. Add a small amount of FROZEN fruit and 8 ounces of water. I then add 1 cup of yogurt, and a full banana, mix it up for 10 seconds. Add one scoop of RAW meal, 3/4 scoop of Miracle Reds, and a short blast of almond milk. Hit "blend" on the blender for about 20 seconds, and then "liquify" for another 15-20 seconds. I find that just "blending"makes the shake thicker than I would like. Ending with liquify keeps the shake somewhat thick, but a "perfect" consistency to drink.<br /><br />I can't date a RAW meal shake like I could with a Garden of Life Protein shake. In other words, I can't sip it over a long period of time while reading the news in the morning. I need to drink a RAW meal before the chill starts to wear off. Read: Needs to be as cold as possible. But here's where it got even better. Remember, the grassy aftertaste when I started drinking this? Drink 4 ounces of water after you finish the shake and wallah, no more cow eating grass aftertaste. Today I tried HALF a scoop of Chocolate RAW meal .... with .... HALF a scoop of Vanilla RAW meal, and now my morning shake tastes good. Really good.<br /><br />Moreover, this shake keeps me going for several hours before I realize, "oh, is it lunch time already?" Best advice I can give people..... make this puppy your own drink variation.

review/summary: Fear NOT - this does taste good!
review/text: I have become a big fan of RAW products because of their bio-availability, but I was leary of whether I would be able to get this down. After reading the reviews on this and the vanilla flavor, I decided to take the plunge. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers to cut the amt. of powder in half and add in the fz. banana. I use 1/2 fz. banana, 1 cup soy milk, 1 cup water, and a handful of ice cubes. This keeps it from becoming too thick (which I find impossible to swallow). Making it this way is actually tasty and enjoyable. (The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I didn't want anyone to expect it to taste like an ice cream milkshake. I'd have given it 4-1/2 stars, but they don't offer that option.) I have tried this with and without the banana and other fruits. I have found that both this one and the vanilla meal taste best when mixed with the 1/2 raw banana (and I'm not that big of a fan of bananas otherwise). Another good-tasting option is to use 1 cup soy milk and 1 cup brewed, flavored coffee (unsweetened; I like my coffee sweetened with agave and soymilk--don't get me wrong--but when adding it to this powder, you don't need the extra sweetness and calories). I originally bought the vanilla because most reviewers preferred the vanilla over the chocolate and the plain. However, I found single-serving pouches at our local Vitamin Cottage Natural Grocers and bought a pouch of each flavor before my Amazon order of Vanilla arrived. I actually preferred the chocolate and was disappointed that I'd ordered the vanilla. However, I have almost used up my (huge) container of vanilla meal powder and have enjoyed it every day and am ready to now get a chocolate container. Hope you find this helpful :)

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I am not one to review everything I purchase (as much as I would like to, I don't always find the time), but after trying this product before reading reviews, and then reading some of the negative ones, I felt compelled to come on and defend it. This product is incredible! It is thick, chocolate-y, delicious, and so healthy it's hard to believe you can get that much packed into a powder. I am a huge advocate for a plant-based diet but am not always on it 100% (as much as I like to think I am :)). This is a wonderful substitute for a processed or mediocre lunch that I usually would have. I feel satisfied and happy after drinking this. And, it's SO MUCH cheaper than buying a lunch at the cafe in my office. I typically spend anywhere from $4-$10 a day on a salad, a sandwich, noodles, etc. from the cafe, but this costs $2.87 a meal (2 scoops with 14 servings in each). The initial price tag looks high, but when you do the math, it's great. Coupled with the health benefits, it really can't be beat. I definitely recommend!<br /><br />Just as an FYI, I poured 16 ounces of unsweetened almond milk into a Blender Bottle (an amazing time-saving alternative to a blender for things like this IMO - look it up if you haven't seen them), added two scoops, and shook it up. I work in HR and did it while processing payroll at my desk at work...took practically no time at all. So, you can't complain about wasting time blending - get yourself a Blender Bottle and some plant milk and you are good to go. :) Peace & Love!

review/summary: Good Organic Meal Replacement
review/text: I have used many meal replacement powders and protein shake powders, so their use is not new to me.  The taste and texture leave a bit to be desired, but overall it is a great product! If you do not drink it right away, it will get very very thick as there is a good amount of fiber in this product.  This powder does not have the normal sweet chocolate taste you may be accustomed to in other products, as it is raw, natural, and does not contain sugar but I did find it easy to get used to.  I have never felt this full with the use of any other product.  I usually feel the need to eat a piece of fruit or something with the use of other shakes, but this one certainly made me feel full for a while and I didn't need a light snack or anything for at least 3 hours afterwards.  I highly recommend this shake!

review/summary: I cherish raw meal
review/text: Shrank my stomache. I used to eat large proportions even though I am a petite 5'3 118lbs girl- I would match the same proportions of my bf of 210lbs!<br /><br />After drinking one scoop a day for breakfast, I found that I am only able to eat about half of my normal proportions of solid foods.<br /><br />Have I lost weight? No the numbers on the scale are the same however I have definitely become more leaner. My thighs used to have a lot of water retention but now have slimmed down by nearly 1/2 the size. My muscle definition is more noticeable. I will keep drinking this after my workouts. I feel invincible!<br /><br />Thank you raw meal inventors. Please keep this winner on the market. The price is affordable ($30-$40). I wish everyone who wants to become healthier-- to try this product.

review/summary: So Pleased To See A Chocolate Version On The Shelf!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised to see a chocolate version of this on the shelves when I went to buy the original Raw Meal.  (I make it a rule to never turn down chocolate.) It tastes delicious. I know it does because not only do I like it but my six year old drank it two days in a row now without turning her nose up to it, which is rare. Any time I can get so many vitamins, nutrients, proteins and probiotics in one good tasting meal, I am a happy woman. ;)

review/summary: Good product!
review/text: I haven't tried the original flavor because people's reviews said that the taste was horrible so I decided to try the chocolate flavor.  The chocolate flavor is not bad at all and actually reminds me of a chocolate milk shake (not as good of course).  The serving suggests 2 scoops per drink, but I am a 26 year old girl and I think one scoop for me is plenty. I blend one scoop with almond milk and banana or frozen berries and it tastes pretty good. Make sure to drink it fairly quickly as the shake thickens up and becomes a thicker consistency which is not super pleasant to drink.  If you are going to use bananas, use a bit more liquid to thin out the consistency.<br />I think it's a great meal substitute. I've been drinking the raw meal instead of breakfast and dinner for the past month or so. I can't say that it lasts me from breakfast to lunch time as I do get a bit hungry and eat a snack before lunch.  It works fine instead of dinner with a small snack also, maybe a yogurt or some nuts or a boiled egg.  It does satisfy hunger pretty well.  I don't experience any headaches, dizziness, or weakness.  Feel pretty good actually!<br />I do not observe any unusual bloating or gassiness as some people are experiencing. I did notice that I go #2 a little more frequently, so if you are experiencing problems in that department, I think this meal will help you.<br />I did notice some weight loss.  I don't use a scale and mainly go by how my clothes fit. However, I've been very good about dinking this meal instead of breakfast and instead of dinner and pants that were super tight on me a month ago, fit me well now.  Just try to incorporate some exercise into your regime for better results. I feel fine and not hungry or starved.<br />I am on my second jar of raw meal.  I do intend to purchase it again. It's super good for you and has a ton of good stuff to maintain your health!  Plan on purchasing it at least once a month, if you use 2 scoops instead of one, you may have to purchase it even more frequently....that is if you will drink it as regularly as I have been.  The jar is huge but so is the scoop!

review/summary: I CAN DRINK THIS!
review/text: I first tried the regular RAW organic Meal replacement, but I felt like I was a horse eating oats out of a trough. As soon as I discovered a RAW meal chocolate version, I ordered it. I thought "please taste OK enough to drink without gagging". I wanted soooo badly to like the regular one, but couldn't do it (and I eat everything, picky eating is not in my vocabulary). After the chocolate version arrived, I mixed it with just water, took a sip, and....EUREKA!!! ^^<br />  The "horse oat" taste is still there, but DRAMATICALLY reduced. You only taste it for about a second or two (again with much reduced taste) and then it goes away. The chocolate flavor takes over from there, completely replacing the "oat" taste". It leaves a nice after taste in your mouth. I no longer feel like a horse.<br /><br />Thank you Garden of Life! You now have a loyal consumer of this product. I will always be sure to have my kitchen stocked with this at all times.<br /><br />I have not tried the vanilla but I may switch it up in a couple of months.

No Soy snuck in there!<br /><br />It also has flax and chia seeds, so it has a good amount of plant EFAs. I don't use it for a meal replacement Per Se, I use it as one of my whole food supplements. Although, I don't eat 3 meals a day anyway.<br /><br /> I am glad I found  it.<br />It does have some green food in it, but I still take  a pure green food at least once a day.<br /><br /> The best part is that it is from Garden of Life. To me this is the best company around. I know I sound like an add, but I use a lot of whole food products and this company has been true to high quality and creativity. They use stevia and cacao in this product which adds to the taste and nutrition. Enjoy!

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I've been using the RAW Organic Meal (regular flavor) for several months.  I've never had a problem with the taste, although I wouldn't say it's the most pleasant.  This however is delicious!  Granted...I love chocolate, so automatically I enjoy the taste more, but overall I think they did a wonderful job of balancing the taste of the drink without compromising the healthiness of it.  One other reviewer mentioned, and I'll note too, that this actually has less sugar than the regular flavor.  A considerable amount less actually.  I'm not sure how that works b/c this definitely tastes sweeter in my opinion.  It's not a chocolate milkshake...don't expect to crave it like ice cream...but for a health drink, it's delicious!<br /><br />I mix this with coconut milk, 1/2 scoop of Garden of Life Perfect Food (greens), and L-glutamine.  If it is too thick for you, split the mixer as half milk and half water.  I generally only use 1 1/2 scoops (serving size is 2) and that seems to be plenty for me.

review/text: I bought this product at Down to Earth at a much better price then what I found online which was very surprising to me. I've always had a low tolerance for shakes and meal replacement products but I wanted to give this one a try. It's day one and I added 16oz of soymilk to the two scoops of mix. The shake got really thick like others before me experienced. Although I really didn't mind the thickness it all tasted pretty good. I was able to drink the entire serving during my morning commute to work. A few minutes later I felt full and energized to start my day. I think this really is a good supplement to my diet that covers all the bases. It was explained to me at Down To Earth that this provides everything that a multivitamin provides and more. This is what I needed for my intense workouts throughout the week. I will definitely be buying this more often.

review/text: Very disappointed in the chocolate Raw Meal.  I have used the original flavor for about a year in place of breakfast and while I can't say I love the flavor, I don't mind it, I think its pleasant, and I think it tastes like food not chemicals.  So, I expected the same taste, but chocolate.  I'm sad to say the flavor is weird and plain old yucky.  I think the flavor is more stale baking cocoa than chocolate and the stevia makes it too sweet with that weird, bitter aftertaste.  I thought the original was sweet enough and I think the chocoalte flavor didn't need to be so sweet.  I  wish there had been the single serving packets to try first.  I made it again today but put it into the blender with kale and carrot juice, thinking I could disguise the flavor (nope!) but I still got that stevia bitterness.  I'll finish it, but I'll be back to the original next time.  I gave it 2 stars cause it still contains a lot of good stuff and I feel good after having it.

review/summary: The Brits secret to great curry
review/text: British friends of ours who are nuts about curries put us on to Patak's curry pastes.  I thought it would be difficult to find in the US but voila, Amazon has it.  Start by sauteing diced onion, add other ingredients such as garlic, red pepper, tomato paste, whatever to your taste.  Then add a tablespoon or more of Patak curry paste.  They come in different intensities and levels of heat with the Madras warm but not too hot.  The secret shared by the Brits is to make the sauce a day ahead of time and let it sit and integrate in the fridge overnight.  Next day, add veggies, chicken, lamb, whatever your choice might be and cook on the stovetop or in the oven then serve with potatoes or basmati rice and condiments such as raisins, coconut, pine nuts, and of course chutney.  That's it.  They swear by Patak -- why make your own curry sauce from all those spices and ingredients when Patak's done it for you?

review/text: This is one of my favorite products from Nueva Cocina.  This is some of the most authentic tasting Cuban food that can be prepared in under 30 minutes.  It tastes like it took hours to make, I can't believe someone was able to create this taste from a box. Very unique flavor.

review/summary: the perfect cup
review/text: I went to a coffee convention in Las Vegas. I was just along for the ride as a guest. However, I have been on the hunt for a perfect cup of coffee for a long time. First I will tell you what I want in my morning cup. I want a latte without alot of drama. I don't want to go through a complicated process with alot of noise or big expense. I have found my solution. This coffee press allowed me to put my own coffee (PEETS) in the adaptor, pour the water in and press. NO noise no whirring steaming hiss. I microwave milk and pour the "espresso" in. I use a very small amount of water and get a smooth delicious concentration of coffee. If you want a regular cup of coffee just add more water. I have just placed my order with Cafejo. I put a review here because I am an Amazon shopper and think it should be sold here. Order with confidence in a good product.

review/text: just got mine today... haven't tried the free sample coffee pod or k-cup that came with it yet, but i tried a bag of tea that i had in my pantry, and it came out amazing... heated the water in my microwave, then poured from my mug into the cylinder, it saturated the pouch and already started to drip through before i inserted the plunger, i let it steep for a few seconds then slowly started pressing, it came out nice and dark..  couldn't pour from the blue handle because it would just slide down, due to how new it is...  very happy with the end result..  will try the k-cup in the morning, but i expect the same results...  wonderful product...  almost gave 4 stars due to how long it took to receive the back-ordered product, but i'm just too happy about the quality of the tea...  the order process should be a lot quicker now that they are back in-stock...  now to buy some k-cups!

I love the fact that it includes an adapter for my own coffee, because I like to use my own freshly ground beans from a local coffee bean roaster. ( Did I mention coffee snob?)<br />Having a way to make an easy,fast and excellent cup of coffee makes getting up in the morning something to really look forward to. It is small and light enough to take on my travels too, and will  be perfect for the office.  Thanks for a wonderful product at a great price!

review/text: I am disappointed with this press. I was hoping it would make a good cup of coffee like the AeroPress does but there is no comparison... and the AeroPress also cleans up much easier. If you are looking for a great cup of coffee...look elsewhere. If you don't have a Keurig machine and want a inexpensive way to use K-Cups then you may be satisfied. Howevert the machine is much faster and easier to use.

review/summary: Folks with Cuban relatives say it's excellent!
review/text: My title says it all. I've had a friend say it's very similar to her Cuban aunt's Arroz con Pollo.  I spoke to the company's representative in FL one day and didn't even know this at the time ... but she mentioned all the ingredients were natural ... no MSG and added "goodies"... I really really appreciate that!<br /><br />Anyway, I am very sensitive to too much salt in recipes but I always add 1/2 cup of rice (and cup of boiling water) to the pot before closing lid and simmering. This "beefs up" the number of servings) and also tones down the sodium content per serving.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a five-star recipe in a box ... and guests will ask you what you did. Be prepared to share the Amazon link!!

review/summary: Can Be Made so Its Diabetic Friendly!
review/text: If you are a type 2 diabetic, then you've probably discovered that there's no such thing as "fast food" for the most part. Even a cup of soup and a sandwich causes my blood glucose to spike. There are just too many carbs in canned soup and most bread that is from the supermarket.<br /><br />Both my husband and I come from families where there is a strong history of type 2 diabetes. Despite being very active and a normal weight, my husband was diagnosed about 10 years ago and I was diagnosed in January 2012.<br /><br />When I was first diagnosed, I was SO STRESSED out because many of the recipes that I've spent a lifetime collecting were now "bad" for us. Some of them could be made diabetic friendly but it required lots of prep time which I don't always have. And I found that much of the information we were given by our diabetes educator and nutritionist simply was wrong and didn't allow for good blood glucose control.<br /><br />What to do???<br /><br />I was cleaning out my pantry of all the "bad" foods and found the last package of Nueva Cocina Arroz con Pollo Rice Mix I had left. We probably ate this a couple of times a month but I thought it would be just one more thing I'd have to give up. Then I remembered.....This WONDERFUL company packages the rice separately from the spices! After reading through the list of ingredients, I realized there is NO maltodextrin in this and if I used my own whole grain rice, I could fit this in our diet.<br /><br />This has become my "go-to" meal on days I'm pressed for time. To make this meal even quicker, I parboil whole grain rice, rinse and drain well and freeze in packets. I pre-cook boneless chicken just until the "pink" is gone and freeze packages of it as well.<br /><br />On days I get home late or just don't feel like cooking, I can get this meal on the table in less than 30 minutes.<br /><br />Heres how:<br />I use about 1 cup of parboiled whole grain rice from my freezer<br /><br />approximately 1.5 lbs of pre-cooked boneless chicken<br /><br />1 to 2 cups of Pictsweet brand "Seasoning Blend" recipe helper - it's found in the frozen food aisle and consists of chopped green and red bell pepper, onion and celery.<br /><br />Then I just pretty much follow the instructions on the box of Nueva Cocina Arroz con Pollo rice mix.<br /><br />Lots of times, as it's cooking, I'll add more chicken broth or water to keep the mixture "saucy" and I cook until I'm sure the whole grain brown rice is done.<br /><br />If I have fresh mushrooms on hand, I'll slice up some and add that to the mix while it's cooking.<br /><br />This makes two meals for my husband and me. For meal number 2, we wrap the mixture in low carb tortillas and I serve it with a salad.<br /><br />I fix this at least once a week now. I honestly don't know what I'd do without it. It's the ONLY pre-packaged meal I've been able to find so far that we can eat. It doesn't spike our blood glucose, it's versatile - you can add lots of extra veggies or spices if you want and it tastes GREAT.<br /><br />Even if you don't parboil the whole grain brown rice and pre-cook the chicken, this is still a pretty quick meal compared to a lot of diabetic friendly recipes I've tried.<br /><br />So long as they keep making this, I'm going to keep it in my pantry.

I wanted to use these up so what I do is add a dash of cinnamon to spice it up.  Overall, these are ok, but not if you are looking to replace your cinnamon roll snack to avoid calories.  These will not cut it for that, unfortunately.

review/summary: First try of haggis - Excellent and perfect with certain dishes
review/text: I opened the can and had it slide out in a perfect can shape like Thanksgiving cranberry sauce. Sure it doesn't impress by looking at it though heat it up and be impressed. The aroma of spices had a very savory, nutmeg laced with sage quality, and I topped it over mashed potatoes and turnips (called swede by the Scots) and whipping cream, which were then topped over pan-fried onions.<br /><br />Very ancient cuisine and one I've gained an appreciation for. When first hearing about haggis being roasted in the heart of an animal, tossed in with various undesirable-to-eat organs, I had to ask a Scottish foreign exchange student about how undesirable it sounded. He naturally (being Scottish) told me it was very good. And of course the Highland beef haggis isn't quite as traditional as lamb versions, and neither does this can utilize the traditional methods of organ meat other than liver. Whether or not the other versions are particularly better might be debated, and I wouldn't be able to comment. The flavor alone works as a good compliment to other foods, and the texture works in favor of what I had prepared just now.<br /><br />I'm interested in trying it along with the Irish stew by Caledonian Kitchen. The companies' location is very near to where I live and I was hoping to drop by to see if it was possible to make pick-up orders. . .  I suspect not as their website doesn't offer it, and only through various vendors are you able to buy anything, though there isn't much of any way to have a fairly consistent stock other than the internet.
