review/summary: Delicious high fiber cereal - Even for Kids!
review/text: Since there were no reviews, I thought I would share my opinion of this cereal. It is delicious, even my five year old son loved it. If you like the blueberry Optimum, you will probably like this as well. There are more brown rice crisps which I think makes it more appealing to kids. If you think the blueberry Optimum is a little heavy, you might like this better. The rice crisps make the overall texture lighter. I would order again and recommend.

review/summary: Smaller than the average fruit cake...but delicious!
review/text: I ordered this with a large multi-pack of Walker's Shortbread, and was quite surprised to find them both shipped inside the same (not large) box. That was my first clue that this was going to be smaller than the average fruit cake. The confirmation came when I opened it up...<br /><br />Very fine packaging--I wanted to keep the box, but the wife quickly "recycled" it.<br /><br />The Whiskey Cake itself is outstanding in both flavor and texture. It's not the absolute best manufactured "fruit cake" I've ever eaten, but it's certainly quite delicious. The sultanas and whiskey do a fantastic job keeping the cake moist, though you'll obviously want to keep it in a sealed container once opened.<br /><br />For the price, it's a very reasonable value for a high-quality, delicious cake, whether considered a whiskey cake, fruit cake, or whatever. Certainly worth making a holiday tradition! And, as an added bonus, it's small enough to be easily re-gifted if it's not your sort of thing.

review/summary: Delicious Treat!
review/text: I know it may sound like an oxymoron, but this is a delicious fruitcake. Really dense and moist, I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality and complex flavor of the cake.<br /><br />It's not super "chunky" like some traditional American fruitcakes are - in fact, the cake is pretty smooth with only little candied bits through it.<br /><br />It is small, but for a small after dinner sweet for four people (perhaps served with a single malt?) it's perfect. Great to keep in the cupboard for unexpected company/visits!

review/summary: Less Than Perfect
review/text: I am on a quest for the perfect fruitcake.  This year I ordered A Glenfiddich fruitcake and one from the Trappist Abbey.  I have to say while it wasn't perfect, the Trappist Abbey fruitcake seemed moister and more fruit-laden.  I like cherries, and the Trappist fruitcake had a nice percentage of them (and not those tough candied ones either but really soft,tasty ones) as well chunks of pineapple.<br /><br />I have nothing against Glenfiddich Scotch (mercy, no!) but it didn't translate to the fruitcake very well.  Brandy seems to add more flavor and keep things moister as it cures.  Personally, I'd like a self-igniting fruitcake.  Next year I'm going to try my hand at making my own.

review/summary: Little cake with a big punch
review/text: The whiskey cake is the size of a large muffin, such as the large muffins they have at Costco. The cake I received was very moist and the expiration date was about a year away. As for taste it is very rich, you probably won't be able to eat very much in one sitting. I split mine up in to four pieces and ate one piece each day after dinner. To me it is essentially a fruit cake with a hint of whiskey in it. I did enjoy this cake and plan on buying more for the upcoming holidays.

I happen to like fruitcake (unless it is that horrible stuff from the grocery store) and I think that this is outstanding. There are other brands that are considered by some to be better quality, but those cost several times as much. If you like, or know someone who likes fruitcake, don't hesitate to purchase this.

review/summary: Another excellent product from Nature's Variety
review/text: I've written reviews for other Nature's Variety products and this one is just as great as the others.<br /><br />My oldest cat has a food allergy to chicken (and it seems turkey too) and he does pretty well on this food. He did the best on the Prairie Lamb & Oatmeal; however that food was discontinued... so this has been the next best thing.<br /><br />My youngest cat was plumping up when she was 1-2 yrs old, so I set my cats up on timer feeders. Once I switched to Nature's Variety brand catfood for my oldest's food allergy, she slimmed down and no longer requires the timer feeder.<br /><br />The food is pricy, but they also eat much less and its healthier for them... so it pays in the longrun. They seem to love the flavors they've tried as well. The only downside is that the "end" result, if you know what I mean, stinks! :) If you can deal with that, the advantages of the food are wonderful!

review/summary: Happy to find a childhood favorite!
review/text: The Raisins & Spice flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal was a favorite of mine as a child, and I have not been able to find it at my local grocery stores. I was very happy to find it at Amazon.  I bought this four-pack concerned that I may not enjoy the flavor as much as I did when I was young (and then what would I do with four boxes of the stuff??), but not to worry -- I'm enjoying it immensely.  And I'm not sure if it's due to the added fiber content of the raisins or what, but it seems more filling than the other varieties, and it takes me longer to get hungry for lunch.  Did I mention it's delicious?  I find I reach for this flavor over the Maple & Brown Sugar which has been my favorite in my adult years...

review/summary: The Raisins and Spice that are Oh So Nice!  A chilhood favorite Still rings true
review/text: This particular flavor of Quaker's Instant Oatmeal (the Raisin and Spice) is a nostalgic flavor of mine that does not grow old.  It's one of those comfort foods for me that brings back a lot of memories.  I love the Quaker Instant Oatmeal although I tend to lean toward the Irish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MOX8DC">McCann's Irish Instant Oatmeal, Regular, 11.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> when I am buying it to eat more regularly. Still, this flavor and blend of spices is so warm and nice.<br /><br />Reminds me of a snowy day growing up (rare as it was in MD.) and just some really enjoyable and simple times.  This little lavender pack of oatmeal will rank on top of my comfort food list.  Have always loved it and always will.  It's a treat. :)<br /><br />My packs arrived fresh from Amazon and in good shape.  They were not expired (still 1.5 years to go) and I didn't notice any strange flora or fauna in the mix :-/ -- just spicy coated raisins and oats ... and my favorite blends of various cinammons and whatever spices they use to get that great flavor.  I could be speaking from a lot of nostalgia ... but if you've made it to this product and my product review I am thinking you may feel that sense too.<br /><br />Here's what I say ... GO FOR IT! ;)

review/summary: Quaker having quality control problems?
review/text: One of the raisins was too crunchy, not at all like a raisin, so I spit it out and examined it carefully. It was the remains of a very dead and dessicated fly. Until examined with a magnifying glass, it did visually resemble a raisin.<br /><br />One mistake in inspecting raisins doesn't condemn a company but while I thankfully haven't found another, I have frequently found dark-colored detritus in this and other flavors of Quaker Instant Oatmeal. I can't say what the dark stuff is, but when isolated and inspected, it disintegrates easily. I have come to the conclusion that this company is having quality control issues. Just my take on it based on direct experience.

I thought I'd cut cost instead of having a friend send them to me.  You get what you pay for.  Instead of my tasty flakey chocolately bar, I got a flat, pale looking crumbling mess (except for the places where it had melted and fused together).  In all Flake is an excellent product.  I'd give it 4.5 stars.  But you have to be careful of the seller.  It might be better to buy them from an import gourmet food store or have someone in the UK (if you know someone) mail them to you.  I've learned my lesson.

review/text: Please don't order these, I received mine close to the expiration date. The candy was so stale and it has some arabic writing on it? When I ordered, it said shipped from U.K. so I don't know why they have foreign language printed on it. It doesn't matter to me where it's shipped from but they shouldn't ship products that are expired or about to expire. Disgusting!

review/summary: Stale
review/text: I love Flake. I get it whenever I go to Ann Arbor, as the World Market down there is the closest place that sells it (an hour and a half drive for me). So I know what this is supposed to taste like, and...this is not it.<br /><br />The candy is stale. I would think this is a seller problem, not Cadbury's...but according to Amazon I'm wrong about that (as I tried to leave seller feedback about the state of the candy).<br /><br />The thing is, not all of the bars were stale. Also, I've purchased a six pack of these before at World Market, and the six bars came in a packaging clearly made for them. It had the nutritional information on the back, the design on the front, etc. These bars came in a clear plastic wrap container with a big white sticker that said 'Flake 6 Count.' Clearly not the original packaging.<br /><br />I wont purchase again. I'll hold out for a trip to Ann Arbor. So much for saving myself the hassle.<br /><br />EDIT: Just wanted to add...there's some arabic writing on the packaging. Maybe I never noticed before, but I've never seen this on Flake purchases I made in an actual store. Just a big disappointment all around.

review/summary: From Pakistan, not England
review/text: Imagine ordering chocolate that is supposed to be from England and receiving chocolate wrapped in paper with Pakistani language(Urdu)all over it. Yes, it contained English translation but I didn't order candy from Pakistan. I ordered candy from England thru Trade Concepts. The candy is not "flaky" but rather stale and old and tasted like cheap milk chocolate. If this indeed comes from England, why do the wrappers indicate they are from Pakistan?<br />I also ordered the "Crunchie" (which is nothing even close to the Violet Crumble from Australia). These too are from Pakistan. The center is not flaky or crunchy or crumbly but rather stale and old.<br />If you advertise that something is "from England" that is the only packaging it should be in. Because of the Urdo all over the wrappers, I can only assume that perhaps Trade Concepts imports from England, removes the wrapper and then rewraps them in their own wrappers? I'm sure the FDA would be interested in this practice.<br />I see by some of the other reviews that I was not the only customer deceived.

review/summary: Too sweet
review/text: Assuming you get these from a good seller(which most people on here didn't seem to get, so be careful about where you get them!), these are far too sweet! They are a decent chocolate, similar to Cadbury milk chocolate bars you can get in the US, but they have an interesting flaky texture. I think they are a bit sweeter than regular Cadbury milk chocolate bars(but those are already pretty sweet too, so am not sure), and even though I like the texture, it's not worth it to pay so much for them. I suggest if you're craving Cadbury chocolate just stick with the kinds you can get in the US, it saves you money and hassle.

review/summary: NOT WORTH IT!
review/text: I loved Flake bars when I lived in England, and I've missed them. In spite of the bad reviews and warnings, I took a chance and ordered them here. Complete waste of money. :( They're obviously made for export as they're covered in Arabic writing. It's hard to even determine where they were made. They say (in English) that they're made *for* Cadbury, but not where they're made. I don't really care so much about that or the inability to read the wrappers, but the quality is AWFUL. They're all dried up, chalky looking, and off-tasting. I tried to finish one, but couldn't get past 2 bites. Now I'm stuck with 5 more that I'd only give to someone I didn't like. I'd give them to some unlucky Trick-or-Treaters, but I don't want them to TP my house. :(

review/text: My wife is from Europe (Russia mainly, but she's also lived in England) and she claims that European candies are better than American candies. She says that European candies are less sweet and more flavorful. From the ones I've tried, I'd have to agree. Funny, I'd never thought about it before. In any case, we live not to far from a Fresh and Easy market. It's a British company and they have a lot of British things, including candies. I've had several varieties of Cadbury chocolate things that were just extraordinary. As such, this evening I picked up a Cadbury Flake Bar. Mmmmmm, Gooood! That''s just delicious! It's not too sweet and has a nice rich cocoa/chocolate taste. My goodness! These are excellent!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Good but NOT from England/Britain
review/text: I have a good friend who lives in Britain, so THAT is how I found out about Cadbury Flakes, she sent me a bunch of them and I got seriously hooked! However, packages kept costing over $50 to send! So I saw these and decided to try it. The packaging is NOT from Britain, it's in a whole 'nuther language, so I opened it and tried it anyways and I PROMISE you, I compared the TRUE cadbury flake to this one and there really wasn't too much difference in taste, you'll find that most chocolate will taste like it may have melted a bit somewhere along the way, UNLESS you pay about $30 extra to send it overnight in a cold package (trust me, I do that often with chocolates from CT to TX)<br />I would (and am again) purchase this, it's still better than (one of my faves) Hershey chocolates and beats the cadbury products we have here. Maybe it's the texture, but it's pretty good PLUS I save an extra $50 just by ordering it from here.

review/summary: bad tasting candy, other reviews were right.
review/text: 1) these candy bars were apparently made for overseas distribution but never got distributed.  Now the vendor needs to offload them.  I ordered from a company in Mass. figuring that all the reviews talking about candy with asian/indian language on the wrapper might be avoided but it was not.  Seems you will get these "overseas" bars wherever you get them from.  Even if only one state over.<br /><br />2) more to the point, these bars were horrible tasting.  I took two bites of the first one, and then tossed the entire group in the trash.<br /><br />There it is then.  Hail Flavius!

review/summary: melt-in-your mouth light, airy, not too sweet milk chocolate
review/text: The first time i bought this chocolate was in a small upscale shop with a lot of imported foods.  It was kind of stale but what can you expect when it's made in the UK and not the US??  But in any case, it wasn't too sweet and it was very light and easy to bite into, like biting into feathery light chocolate flakes, compared to the usual US mainstream cheap chocolate bars which are overly sweet with tons of sugar and too dense to bite into.  It's not something that I would go out of my way to buy since I would buy premium chocolates like TCHO chocolates <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BOI8NY">TCHO-A-DAY 30</a> or McElrath chocolates  or even Lindt or Ritter chocolates or Ghiradelli, but I'd certainly select them over our usual cheap chocolate candy bars in the US.

review/text: Product arrived 3/12/2012. Item is marked 3/10/2012 with what I can only assume is the expiration date. Product not intended for U.S. as it has Arabic, Greek and Chinese lettering. There is some English but its a bit hidden. Not that the text needs to be English but combining this with the expiration leads me to believe the candy isn't intended for U.S. market. Is there a law against that, selling expired goods imported from another country? This product was packaged by Amazon LLC.<br /><br />I don't want to hurt the product itself with a low rating. Its probably good stuff, but I'll never know because Amazon sold me expired goods.

review/text: January 3, 2012<br /><br />I purchased the Beef Stroganoff from Omaha Steakhouse last week. It arrived in a small tray covered with plastic. I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars.

review/summary: Best tasting instant coffee and sugar free too!
review/text: This is the Taster's Choice that I bought 2 years ago, and now buying more because the brewed stuff takes way too long, and in fact, the Taster's Choice tastes better than the brewed stuff.<br /><br />After I ran out of these packets when I bought then in 2010, I decided to go back to the brewed coffee for about a month  (I ground the beans right before I made the coffee) to see if there was any difference in taste.  I could not believe it - I preferred the taste of the Tasters Choice instant stick packets over the expensive organic decaf and regular whole ground beans that I had been buying! So after a month of trying the ground beans and brewed coffee (Hawaii's excellent Lion Coffee with Coconut, Hawaii's Macadamia nut coffee, Blue Mountain coffee, organic colombian decaff from whole foods), I am back to the Taster's Choice packets!<br />It just doesn't beat it for taste and convenience.<br /><br />I am specifically looking for a clean, delicious coffee taste, without any sugar or carbs added. It tastes delicious without anything else added to it.  For fun and health reasons, sometimes, I simply add a dollop of organic coconut oil to make sure I get my daily dose of good fat, add lots of cinnamon to lower the body's insulin response (to caffeine) and it is rich and delicious! Yumm. Please don't ever take this off Amazon - the store prices are waaaay more and it is much cheaper at Amazon!<br /><br />The local Korean grocery store also carry the Korean Brand of Taster's Choice in 100 packet bags but they have it heavily mixed with sugar and milk (very delicious - by the way - if you like sugar and cream in your coffee) but they do not sell it without the sugar and cream so I am buying it at Amazon.

review/summary: No Wheat + No Corn = Big Hit with the Doggies
review/text: Newman's Own Organic Chicken Treats for Dogs are a big hit with my three dogs; a miniature poodle, a black lab and a standard doxie. Made in Canada these have the following analysis:<br /><br />Crude Protien: 11.5% min<br />Crude Fat: 8.5% min<br />Crude Fiber: 6.0% max<br />Moisture: 10.0% max<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Barley flour*, ground chicken*, carrots*, apples*, canola oil, rolled oats, natural flavor.  Note: (*) indicates certified organic.<br /><br />SIZE: Medium sized in this case means 'heart-shaped', about 1.5" x 1.5".  You could actually break them in half for small dogs.<br /><br />While this is not supposed to replace your dog's food, they'd like it if it did! The reason I give it 4 stars is because of the 'premium price'. I picked them up at a local grocery closeout store for $2 a bag with 18 months left until the the 'best before' date. My doggies haven't said anything about them being stale, so I guess Newman's Own has done it again.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Organic, high quality dog treats. Nice product.

I ordered by accident the large size instead of the small hearts, not thinking that they come in various sizes.  She is a 17 pound pooch and she loved them. They are so soft that they could easily be handled by any size dog. Thank you!

review/summary: Searching for it...
review/text: We bought a single jar at the Mustard Museum in Middleton, WI.  Unfortunately we only purchased one jar since we had a variety of items.  Big mistake on our part.  We've been looking to get another without too much success.<br /><br />Now as to the product itself, we enjoy orange marmalade -- not the bulk produce variety that sits on the shelves of most grocery stores, but the gourmet section.  We like the Tangerine flavor the best, and this is one of the best.

review/summary: Good but not as good as the tea bag version
review/text: I bought this product because it appears that the teabag version of the Pixie mate chai (all of Pixie's teas actually) are no longer being made or sold and it was my favorite drink.  I do not particularly like things that are extremely sweetened so it has been difficult to find the right balance with this concentrate.  It is not bad, it is not great either.  It is extremely sweet as it has the sugar already in it.  The directions recommend mixing half concentrate with half milk and heating.  I found this to be overwhelmingly sweet and thick so I use 1/3 concentrate 2/3 almond milk (which is less sweet even than milk) and sometimes dilute with water a bit as well.  Note this does NOT taste good diluted with just water.<br /><br />If you like things that are very sweet you will love this.  If you find where they are still selling the teabag version please post!

review/summary: 5 stars for chocolate, -1 for service
review/text: I've had the privileges of traveling the world, living in Europe for three years, and being able to sample most any food I've had the desire to taste.  Chocolate has always been one of my favorite foods.<br /><br />That being said, this is simply the best chocolate I've ever had the privilege to sample.  Dozens of subtle flavors dance across the tongue as each type of taste bud brings slight variations in this creamy smooth bittersweet confection.  Best experienced by sharing with a friend, although I'm sure other pairings would work well too.  Easily 5 stars for the chocolate, and the packaging is quite attractive.<br /><br />However, there is more to the experience than simply the product.  In this case, the single 50 gram bar of chocolate costs $12, but the price must include shipping (obviously) which bumps the price to a whopping $22.  No significant options are given for shipping, and "expedited" means that it will take two weeks for the item to arrive.  On the plus side, the chocolate did arrive with a small ice pack, but given that the current ambient temperatures were all well below freezing this seemed rather unnecessary.  The item would have been received much faster, cheaper, and probably as in good of condition if it had been mailed via standard US postage.  So, I deducted one star for service.  I might have thought otherwise had I ordered the item in July; however in that case the single ice pack would not have been enough to survive a two week shipping time.<br /><br />So, overall I highly recommend this chocolate.  Given the cost of shipping, I recommend ordering a quantity sufficient to cover the costs. It only makes sense to order many, as once your friends and family discover you have this wonderful chocolate you'll need enough to share!

review/summary: Best I've had, though only for connoisseurs.
review/text: I live in Venezuela, where the worlds finest cacao beans are grown in a remote village that is only accesible through the sea. The cacao beans grown there are dried in front of the village church in a process the whole town participates in. Ironically, if Venezuelans want to taste their cacao beans turned into chocalate, they must buy it from the extremely high-end Italian chocolatier Amedei, as Amedei has the exclusive rights to all the production of the beans from Chuao, to the last bean. Therefore, when in Europe, I searched for the bars. Amazingly, you can find them easily in classy shops at 10 euros a bar at least. I finally found the gold medal winning Chuao one. I took it back to my hotel. Drank some Perier to wash out all flavor from my mouth. Sat comfortably, and mentally went over the ritual of tasting fine chocolates. I took the first piece, placed it whole on my tongue (you're not supposed to bite), pressed it against the palate and let it do it's magic. The richness, strength, and intense flavor impressed me from the start. As it melted evenly on my tongue, I felt the gnarl of chocalate's natural bitterness, but more woody, remiscent of Royal Salute scotch, but with a sweet smoothness that relaxed my mind. The impressive effect was the aftertaste. The taste of nutty bittersweet wood stayed on my tongue as if the chocolate was still there. Not until I drank more Perrier did it go away. A unique experience in chocolate tasting.<br /><br />I do not recommend a Bud guzzlin' guy to spend money on high-end chocolate such as this one. You can, but you might end up saying that a good 'ol American Hershey bar is better. It's like fine art. If you know nothing about it, you won't fully appreciate it. I recommend it for people that like chocolate and have tried and enjoyed AT LEAST mid-range chocolates such as Lindt and Godiva, and especially if you've tried high-end type such as Cluizel, Scharffen Berger and Valrhona.

review/summary: One of the best single-origin chocolates
review/text: If you think that Hershey's Special Dark is amazing chocolate, please navigate away from this page now and don't look back. Your tongue is not prepared or worthy (as yet) for this chocolate. Save yourself the money and confusion that would be yours should you purchase this chocolate; this territory is off limits to the uninitiated and uneducated. You need to know enough to know *why* this is some of the best chocolate in the world. Suffice it to say that those that are ready for it know that they are ready for it. Are you?<br /><br />So, Valrhona used to have a Chuao, and it was pretty good - Amedei now makes the superior Chuao bar (Valrhona no longer produces one; 2003 was the last year they did so, I believe - Bonnat makes a Chuao, but it isn't worth your time).<br /><br />I haven't tasted this one in a while, so particulars are somewhat hazy - one thing that I do remember quite well is that the beautiful mouthfeel of this chocolate was intense while there was a sufficient quantity present in my mouth, but after I had swallowed the last of it, it quickly left my mouth feeling clean and fresh, as it would feel shortly after brushing my teeth; many chocolates seem to leave my mouth feeling sullied for a long period of time, but not this stuff. Of course, sometimes you *want* your palate to ring with the taste of a chocolate (especially ones that have a really long, complex finish) for a long time - this one simply excites your mouth and quickly moves on, like a flirtation with someone you will never see again; exciting while it lasted, but all it leaves you with is a good memory.

review/summary: Best Chocolate in the World
review/text: Simply put, Amadei produces the best chocolate in the world.  It's not an opinion, as much as it's a restatement of the results of the past three World Chocolate Awards.  Chuao is a lot different than the Porcelana variety.  Both are amazing, with Porcelana being the pure chocolate flavor and Chuao having more hints of fruit in the flavor.  Either way, each bar comes in ten squares.  I couldn't imagine having more than one square at a sitting.  I'd highly recommend either one of them.

review/summary: The Ultimate Chocolate
review/text: Amedei by far makes the best chocolate in the world. I've had a few of their products and the quality is unsurpassed. I know some may think that the cost seems very high, but if you don't know chocolate, this is Not something you sit down and eat all at one time. You simply take one or 2 pieces at a time and savor it in your mouth. No, you don't just chomp down on good chocolate, Do wine experts gulp good wine, certainly not, they savor it. Their is no difference . If you are looking to try something Way above par, then look no further. The texture is smooth, and the taste is something you never forget. You will never go back to your basic bar after Amedei. I hope you take the chance and try it. If buying off the internet is a problem, try going to a local specialty chocolate shop in your area and see if they have it,or just let them order it for you. That way, if it ships incorrectly, they are liable, not you. Hope this helps with your decision.

review/text: I ordered Chocolate from Italy.  Maybe this was the first mistake since it is Texas in the Summer.  Anyway I took a chance because this is suppose to be the best chocolate in the world; according to another website.  Anyway the chocolate arrived at my door when I was not there.<br />So fedex in all its wisdom drove around with it all day and tried again when I was not there.  I had to go to the fed ex office and pick it up.<br />When I opened the box of course the chocolate was soup and the remains of a soggy single ice pack.  What does this say about this company?<br />They ship from Italy with one tiny ice pack; not even dry ice.<br />Also they said it was my fault that I was not home when Fed ex tried to deliver the package.  So I am out $75 and nothing to show for it.<br />Please send a message to this company that their chocolate is not all it is cracked up to be.

review/text: Although their chocolate mint water is my favorite, I enjoy this one as well for variety. I really hate a strong mint taste (like spearmint or peppermint) so I love that this one has a mild mint flavor that just makes it more refreshing than regular water. I also like the orange flavor. It's really nice to have flavored water without extra calories or sodium (as in sparkling water).<br /><br />If the strength of the mint is also important to you, check out their coolness meter on the side of each bottle.<br /><br />I only give four stars because I think the water itself could taste more "pure" like Fiji.

I've read a few reviews of other flavors of MetroMint that claim they taste like toothpaste. I've not had the stronger waters so I can't judge them. But this one certainly does not taste like toothpaste. It's a real treat and I wish it was available in more stores.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />- Susanna K. Hutcheson

review/summary: 1150 or 240 that is the question!
review/text: C. Rust is correct, the bags do contain a little less tea as they are designed for those who make tea by the cup instead of the pot, something (shock horror :^) the British have begun to do more often.  We also discovered this when we first brought back several of these bags from Costco in Manchester England.  I too wondered if it was worth it as it does take 3 to make a pot whereas the 240 count box size only takes 2 so I did the math and found that it was still worth it to get the 1150 bags.  I just did the math again using the US price on Amazon (yes, we are running out and no trip to the UK in the near future) and it is still cheaper to buy the bag of 1150 bags versus the box of 240 bags.<br /><br />The box of 240 is $0.77/oz based on the weight of the tea in the box.  The bag of 1150 is $0.55/oz.  But even if you just do the math with the number of tea bags used it is still cheaper.  The box of 240 at $19.95 a box is $0.08/bag or $0.16 a pot if you use two bags a pot.  The bag of 1150 at $48.95 is $0.043/bag or $0.13/pot when you use 3 bags a pot.<br /><br />BTW, a box of 240 at Sainsburys in the UK costs $9.48 today but if you factor in the airfare to go and  get it I guess we're still getting a bargain here :^)

review/summary: I like PG Tips Tea
review/text: I bought this 1150-count bag and have no complaints. The price was right, because 1150 / $50 comes out to less than five cents per bag, which compares favorably against almost any other brand of tea, let alone PG Tips, which I find superior to most other brands. I do not perceive any difference in the amount of tea per teabag in this container as compared to smaller sizes that I purchased from Fresh Market. The container is just a normal thin papery bag, not resealable without a clothespin or other device, and I intend to relocate the teabags to an airtight container so they will stay fresh. I drink at least a pot of tea everyday, consuming 3 to 6 bags per day, so this bag will be used up in a year's time. But even so, it is a good idea to protect the teabags from oxygen. Any type of plant matter will decompose in the presence of heat, oxygen or light--doesn't matter whether it is tea, coffee or cannabis.

review/text: However, I find it takes 3 bags to make a six cup pot of golden tea instead of the 2 bags I've used previously that come in the boxes.  I'm guessing that they packaged this large bag for restaurant use, and decided to put less tea in each bag.  The tea is still delicious, but it's probably more economical to buy it in the 160 or 240 count boxes.

I told one of my daughters what a good deal I had found on Amazon with this huge bag of tea......and she said, "Mom, is it fresh?"

review/summary: smaller teabags inside the 1150 teabags
review/text: I purchased these teabags thinking they were regular size teabags, as in 2 servings per bag, which at some point in time was how they were made. After I open the large bag 1150 size I notice the actual teabag is much smaller than what I was use to and read on the bag "one cup pyramid teabags" written underneath the 1150. I was use to making a pot of tea using 2 regular teabags so thinking this was the same size, I made a pot of tea using 2 bags and the taste was lacking, also the color paler, so it was then I discovered the bag had less tea in it and was a totally smaller bag. So now I am having to use 3 bags to get the same strength tea, thus not making this such a GREAT bargain by buying a larger quanity, as I am having to use more bags per pot of tea ! I am thoroughly disgusted and won't buy this size again, I am annoyed that the size of the actual teabag was not noted on the discription of this large bag,its not readable on the bag "on line" for the eye to see. I might buy the 250 size if someone can tell me its the regular size teabag, otherwise I shall not purchase from them again, Mrs Laraine Santagato<br />P.S. My sister in England informs me that these teabags posted on Amazon in England DO STATE that they are 1 cup bags, they need to do the same on this on this side of the pond..thanks !

review/summary: Don't do it.
review/text: I drink a lot of tea.  Usually at least 5 or 6 cups a day, sometimes more, perhaps a bit less at the weekend.  I bring tea to the States from UK - usually Tea Direct fairtrade tea, which you can buy at Oxfam.  It's similar to Brooke Bond Choicest Blend, strong, astringent, refreshing.<br /><br />However, I don't drink it at work, as I don't want to use it all up too rapidly, and they don't ship it to the U.S.  So, my working tea is PG Tips.  I've been buying it on Amazon for years now, and the big boxes are fantastic.<br /><br />But, like other reviewers have mentioned, this big bag is a bit cheaper per bag, and I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Someone else mentioned that the weight per bag was a bit smaller, but I thought that letting it steep for the recommended time would counter that.  Unfortunately, it doesn't.  If I leave it in for around 10 minutes, I get an approximation of the flavor from the regular pyramid bag, but after 5 minutes brewing, when I add milk, the tea is a nasty, weakish grey color.  The taste is, well, OK.  It's better than Liptons.  But it is not as good as the ones you can get in the boxes.<br /><br />I won't make this mistake again.  That said, I *will* drink the remainder of the bags (with the help of my missus), but I consider this a failed experiment.

review/summary: Great alternative to the Aspartame drink mixes out there.
review/text: Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy drinking just plain ol' water, but sometimes I desire a little flavor in my beverage, without added sugar.<br /><br />Having said that, I'm surprised that the powdered drink mixes I see at the grocery store are primarily sweetened with aspartame.  After all, Splenda/Sucralose has been out long enough to have made its way to these products.  I found this mix on Amazon and I'm quite pleased with it.  It's sweetened with Splenda, and it has none of the aftertaste often associated with aspartame.  It does indeed taste like fruit punch, with more of a cherry note to it, but very pleasant.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind is that while each little tub makes 2 quarts of beverage per the instructions, I find that using two full quarts of water for one tub makes for a somewhat watered down taste, so I just adjust the amount of water down a bit (though not worth deducting stars).  That is a matter of taste, so of course experiment for yourself.<br /><br />This is a great product and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: More nutrition than you would think
review/text: Cherry Pop Tarts have 10% of the recommended daily allowance of iron, folic acid and niacin. So while not being quite as nutritionally dense as a sugary sweet cereal with sprayed on vitamins, they actually do have some value for vitamins and minerals.<br />Other than that, they are super convenient. If you don't mind burned sugar in your toaster from bits flaking off while you're toasting them, you can just pop them in a toaster to heat them up and add a nice golden toasty flavor to them. You can also eat them straight out of the packet. Each packet holds two pastries, which is very convenient since most toasters have 2 slots. Some have 4. If your toaster has 4, share! You could do a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M2UNG2">Pop-Tarts, Frosted Chocolate Fudge, 16-Count Tarts (Pack of 8)</a> and cherry combination if you are wild for chocolate covered cherries.<br />Kids love these for breakfast. Wives, well, mine at least, not as much. She makes a face at me eating them and mutters something about candy-coated cardboard.<br />Great guilty pleasure.

review/summary: Gooey fruity sweetness in a box
review/text: Cherry flavored Pop Tarts are my favorite. These taste the closest to real fruit and I love them warm from the toaster. I buy them on sale and in bulk and our whole family loves them. This is one of the basic flavors that has staying power over all the new kid friendly flavors they have been developing the past few years.

review/text: The product arrived on time and in good condition. At least I haven't found any broken boxes yet. But the tarts just are not quite fresh.

review/summary: Great
review/text: Pop-Tarts are a great source for breakfast, because you can eat them on the run. Living on a ranch you just grab and go. They have super taste and you can eat them without milk or coffee.<br />KC

review/summary: Not pleased
review/text: Did not get what I ordered and emails to customer service didn't get them so send the correct item. I ordered individual slices not a whole cake.  Finally cut into cake sent.  Dry as sand, we didn't like it and tossed the rest.  Won't deal with company again.

review/summary: Yum! Yum!
review/text: My 7-month old son loves Yummy Spoonfuls! Besides rice cereal, this is the only baby food he's ever eaten. I bought a jar of organic baby food at the grocery store, tried it myself, and it tasted nothing like real food, so I didn't want to feed it to him. I researched other options and found Yummy Spoonfuls (via Cookie Magazine). What a great variety of food for all stages, and it tastes like real food! My son has loved ALL of the veggies ... eats the whole amount every time! Mama and baby couldn't be happier with this product. And I love the fact that it's homemade organic food ... I really wanted to make my own food, but can't find the time or energy, and why should I when Yummy Spoonfuls does it all for me!?

review/summary: Next best option to homemade baby food... if you don't have time to make your own at home!
review/text: Brand/Products - Came across it while searching through net for a good organic option to baby food. In my little research, learned the brand had some recognition in its field - like Cookie magazine, some interviews on CNN and other news channel and also has a fan page on Facebook!!<br /><br />Packaging/Shipping - I was skeptical as it's frozen, but came well frozen in a Styrofoam container with dry ice. Yes, wish there was another way of packaging it, but I suppose it has to come frozen so at this point Styrofoam may be the only option... but then I am no logistic/shipping expert so don't know what other options are out there for frozen product shipping that are a bit more environmental friendly and/or recyclable.<br /><br />I signed up for a 4-month plan they offer for the Mommy Club members listed on their website. The owners are great about taking suggestions and trying to improve product line and shipping methods - I was called about recycling the Styrofoam container... that they will send a return label with my next shipment so I should return it to them and they can keep using the same container for each of my monthly order or until the container lasts so that's little better than having a new container each month.<br /><br />Products - I have tried all variety from Creamy Yummy and now starting to try to Mushy Yummy! My baby loves pretty much all creamy variety. I even did my own mixing at home - like mix creamy carrots with creamy peas, creamy butternut squash with broccoli or green beans and all such combination as my baby didn't really warm up to peas by itself! :) I add the Happy Baby rice, multi-grain, or Oatmeal cereals to the veggies and to fruits to make it little more flavorful for my baby. In morning, I give the entire fruit portion mixed with 3 tbl spoons of cereal (used to also add formula or breast milk when first introduced Yummy solids, but now mix only the fruit and cereal) and rest of day I give a veggie combo with like 1 tbl spoon of cereal. Unless my baby is tired or sick, she eats the whole portion.<br /><br />Cost - Yes, it's expansive at $2 for each 4 Oz container compared to Earth's Best or Full Circle or even Gerber Organic baby food, which by the way, are jar baby food and not frozen like Yummy's. It's your pick what you do want to give your baby and I know we all want the best for our babies so one choice over another may not be bad - just what you are comfortable with and what works with your own lifestyle and budget!<br /><br />Savings/Discount Option - I called the owners asking about discount since I ordered a lot in one order and was told that they offer something called Mommy Club. So if I join the Mommy Club, which means sign up for a 4 month commitment to order at least 84 containers (7 cases) each month in any verity of baby food from Creamy or Mushy line then I'd get each 4 Oz container at a discounted rate of $1.60 per container or something like that plus any shipping cost. So I thought that was much better than $2 per container and I was going to order from them anyway for next 2-3 months so thought signing up with the Mommy Club was a good option for me!! Yes, shipping is still very costly and that's the only reason I gave this a 4 start rating rather than 5 - wish shipping could be a little less costly at this price of product!<br /><br />So those wanting to order longterm, don't forget to call or sign up with the Mommy Club to take advantage of the savings in cost per product.<br /><br />They are also flexible on monthly order volume if you just cannot get to 84 containers each month or take a little more than a month to make the next order... so just call and ask for the details.<br /><br />In my first monthly order, I got a free Yummy Baby bib, too... that was cool.<br /><br />I made a suggestion on adding certain grains and cereals to Yummy product line to the owners and they said they are looking into it and probably will have it available around June 2010 timeframe so I am looking forward to that. Until then I keep using Happy Baby cereals and admit that my baby loves it and so do I. I hope Yummy also adds probiotic and other nutrition to their cereals like Happy Baby does!<br /><br />Overall, I can't be happier with the product given that I am a working mother and do not have the time to consistently make my own at home, at least not the variety of fruits and veggies that Yummy offers!

review/summary: So fresh with NO PRESERVATIVES perfect for my baby
review/text: I am a proud moma to a not so healthy baby and finding clean food that his little body can tolerate has been a huge challenge, We have tried every organic baby food brand but to our total disappointment they all have citric and ascorbic acids added to help maintain their freshness which our son is sensitive too. We never knew about fresh frozen food, we are delighted to find Yummy Spoonfuls, I actually never thought I could find baby food without ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and citric acid added nor that it can actually be made fresh like you would at home, OMG, this is how food should taste, the peas, sweet potato, apple and squash all taste nothing like baby food. You all are amazing for making fresh food for our babies.. Thank you. hol cow, this is good, this is the standard to set for baby food..<br /><br />I am a happy mommy
