review/summary: Not a robust cup of coffee

review/summary: Coffee Let Down
review/text: I had high hopes for this coffee after reading some of the reviews; although some of the reviews were not so favorable either. I should have taken those into account before ordering this coffee. This coffee was awful. I tried it a few times on different water settings on my Keurig thinking that maybe a lower setting would help. Maybe a little, but certainly not much. It was bland and had hardly any flavor. I won't be ordering this coffee again.

review/summary: Brooklyn Bean K cups
review/text: If you like weak or watered down coffee, then this is the product for you.<br />One of the flavors I tried was not too bad but the second one of the same flavor was completely different.  There seems to be no uniform, some being very weak and others week.  The coffee is just bland.  Nothing you can do with it.<br />Just don't waste your money on this product.  The cheapest regular low price coffee would be better than this.

review/summary: Brooklyn Beans K Cups
review/text: Nothing special here, barely any taste at all.  I recieved a few of these in a K Cup sampler.  Definitely on the bottom of my list so far (and I'm from New York!).  Caribou Mahoganey or Barista Prima Italian Roast are on top of my reorder list, smooth bold taste, very flavorable.  The Brooklyn Beans samples (Breakfast and Bridge samples) are weak, no difference between the two.

review/text: Don't know if it's deliberate, or just a bad batch, but the diameter of these cups is a different size from  all the other brands we use. The grounds consistently got into the cup ruining the coffee, and causing a mess in the machine to clean up. We threw away the last 10 or 12 pods.

review/text: Purchased two 40 count boxes, gave them both away, not sure the people even consumed it.  Product says bold but on the half cup it was the color of the weakest tea so you can imagine what it looked like on a full cup.  I am so sorry I purchased this brand and now I am out of the money for it.  It was even hard for me to give it away.  I drink 3 to 4 cups a day and this was the worst I have ever purchased from Amazon.  If you like bold flavor, stay away from this brand.  Coffee grounds also surfaced in the cup, I don't what happened to these two boxes, but I recommend that people who like coffee as much as I do, STAY AWAY.  Ann Glasscock

review/summary: Worst Coffee I've ever tried
review/text: I purchased the variety pack excited to try all of the great sounding flavors, and now that I've tried them all, I'm appalled that Amazon even allows this garbage to be sold.  This is, by far, the worst coffee I've ever tried.  They all taste exactly the same.  Like dirty water with a hint of mocha.  I don't know if these are instant coffee rather than real beans like some others have tried to sell here, but this stuff is just awful.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, don't ever try this stuff.  Regardless of how cheap they make it or how appealingly their friends review it, don't waste one penny on this stuff.<br /><br />To qualify my opinion, I've tried just about every k-cup out there - thousands and thousands of k-cups have gone through my machines in my office and at home.  I can tell you which brands are stronger in general and which are weak.  I can produce a review for just about every k-cup flavor immediately, including the teas, hot chocolates, iced coffees, etc.  Really, I've tried it all.  I've even tried (and been much more satisfied with) k-cups that were expired for over two years.<br /><br />And this coffee is several notches below the worst I've ever tried.  Every flavor.  Just unbelievably bad.<br /><br />Avoid it.

review/text: I love a good cup of coffee....such as REVV, Jet Fuel,Tigers Eye or any of the Caribou flavors here on Amazon.....I got an Email with this coffee featured and thought...what the heck? Lets try it....what a waste of money. wish I could send it back...gave the remainder to a co-worker who even said...'can I toss it?'  Don't get me wrong...I did try each and every flavor....there was one that was ok...but most of them burst open in my keurig before the coffee even was finished.  Plus a few of them shot coffee grounds right into the coffee cup as it was being made.  I like my coffee bold but not bitter...so I tend to be picky, however, I will drink other strengths as well...no matter which one I tried, it was bland...boring....and I lost $24  on this terrible stuff.  Wish we could get our money back...but I won't be purchasing this brand ever again.  Hey, at least I gave it a try!

review/text: I received the pods and after several days am very disappointed. Several of the pods I've used are defective.......they do not brew the appropriate size coffee (pressing the largest cup size I get less than a quarter cup), it comes out in single drips from the very start of the brewing process and many, many grinds in my cup. Now,I don't want to us the remaining pods (I never know which will brew as described) for fear of breaking my Keurig brewer.<br />Having grown up in Brooklyn I was very anxious to try these Keurig pods. I loved the packaging design and the fact that it was  avariety pack. That's where it ends.

review/text: I was skeptical about ordering what with the trouble of the cups exploding, but I didn't have any of that trouble. I did find, however, that it just wasn't full-bodied enough for me.  It left me wanting.  I can usually brew an 8 oz cup from my K-cups but truthfully even brewing at 6 oz I still didn't get the rich flavor I craved. So I've been finishing up the box by brewing it at 2 or 4 oz and adding a different K-cup brand to the mug.  I'd stir clear of this one.

review/summary: Great Coffee, Great Customer Service
review/text: I bought my first box of Fuggedaboudit about two months back.  I was only able to have three or four cups out of 12 K-cups of coffee.  The seals would pop off causing the grounds to go everywhere.  This was a huge issue as coffee grounds are one of the most difficult things to get completely cleaned up.<br /><br />I wrote an email to the manufacture about this issue.  They responded promptly and even admitted the issue.  These days it is uncommon for a company to accept responsibility.  This was a step in the right direction.  After apologizing, they told me they were going to send me some coffee out of the new batch.  I expected a couple of cups, instead I received almost a whole months' worth.  They definitely gave me a reason to give them a second try.<br /><br />The new K-Cups work flawlessly.  Every cup is good and the flavor is consistent.  So far I have tried the Fuggedaboudit, Cyclone, and the French Roast.  These are all darker blends which can have a tendency to be bitter, but not these.  They are all very smooth and flavorful.<br /><br />Don't let the bad reviews about the cups scare you away.  The manufacturer has stepped up and fixed the problem.  I will be buying coffee from Brooklyn Bean Roastery again.

review/summary: Coffee seems weak
review/text: I recently received the Boston Beans 40 cup variety pack and tried each one.  The coffee seems weak, although flavor is ok.  Maybe the type of filter in the cup is hindering the full flavor and strength from coming through.  I normally don't like the french roast and dark roast coffees because they're too strong & bitter, but preferred them in this brand because they were strong enough. I was planning on having a regular delivery of the pack, but have cancelled that.  I like having a variety of coffee flavors available for times when people drop over for coffee.<br /><br />I sometimes wash out the k-cups and reuse them, as they contain a filter.  I noticed these have a different type of filter than other k-cups, which could be inhibiting the flavor.  I did refill a couple of these k-cups with a favorite coffee, and the flavor was not as good as in other brand k-cups when refilled.

Bklyn Beans stated that they addressed the issue.I received my order last week and I am having problems with the grinds too.Nothing more annoying than having grinds in my coffee.The taste is good but the grinds are not.

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: This isn't really a review but more of a frustration.  My husband and I are avid coffee drinkers.  We have had our Keurig for about a year now and really like it.  The problem is we often have a hard time finding a coffee we both really like so for us sampler packs work well for us.  We are always looking for new k-cups and were excited at the chance to try these.  The only problem, they wouldn't ship to us.  My husband is serving in the Armed Forces overseas.  We have the standard overseas P.O. Box and normally don't have a problem ordering anything.  I am disappointed we missed out on a chance to try a new coffee company.  Especially since the reviews about this product are so good and the price very reasonable.  I guess I would say to Brooklyn Beans could you work to fix the problem of not shipping to APO/FPO boxes?

review/summary: Good Quality
review/text: I got the sampler pack, and was, in general, very happy with the coffees. I generally prefer my coffee on the intense side (no, not burnt, but with a lot of flavor), so I found the Corner Donut Shop to be too mild for my taste, but Cyclone was much more in line with my preferences.<br /><br />The coffee was all really fresh for a K-Cup. I found the ones marked Extra Bold to have the right amount of taste, while the regulars were passable.<br /><br />Now that I've sampled the variety, I'm ready to move on to the specific blends that match my palate.

review/summary: Manufacturing QA
review/text: Tried the coffee and liked the aroma and flavor, but the manufacturing of the K cup needs improvement. Nothing is worse than cleaning up the brewer after the seal on the K cup fails and the grounds leak everywhere including the table. This happen on several brews to the point that I was prepared to send the unused product back for a refund.

review/summary: Coffee lover
review/text: So far I have tried The extra bolds - Cylcone, French Roast and Fugghedaboutit.  I have also tired the Donut Shop blend and Maple Sleigh.  Brooklyn Beans does a decent job with middle of the road coffee.  There are no truly bold flavors or accents and this is a very simple coffee.  I prefer the intricacies of Coffee People coffee, the intensity of Starbucks and Barista blend.  There are no nuances to this coffee - all very straight up.  If cheap is what you are looking for this beats Folgers. I think it a step up from Folgers, on par with some of Green Mountain ( I am not a fan) and not even close to Coffee People, Starbucks or Barista Blend.  The flavored coffee (I have only tried Maple Sleigh but flavored coffee is flavored coffee in my opinion) was very good.  I am not a fan of flavored coffee, but this was very good.  The donut shop taste like, well, donut shop coffee and that can be had anywhere and of all the Brooklyn blends I have tired thus far I think this was the most successful.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a medium blend donut shop, I would recommend this if you are looking to save money.  Otherwise, go with Coffee People.  Again, this a good bang for the buck, but not for the discerning coffee drinker who likes a more robust, finely honed flavor to their coffee.

review/summary: Don't get the French Roast
review/text: It's weak and has very little flavor.  It's a little better than typical hotel coffee.  You know it's going to be bad as soon as you brew it as you can see the bottom of the cup.  Who's ever heard of transparent French roast?  Go to McDonald's, theirs is better - no kidding.  The aftertaste is awful - has a hint of decaf.  Now I have 39 left to get through - the trash may be a better place for these.  I'll never buy a Brooklyn brand of coffee again.

review/summary: I am a Starbucks extra Bold Roast kind of girl, so keep that in mind.
review/text: French Roast<br /><br />I love French Roast in general, so I started my variety pack with a Brooklyn Beans French Roast.  I made it as I usually make my K-cups (I drink Van Houtte Eclipse almost every morning) and used a 6 ounce cup of water.  I don't use sugar and do use coffee cream.<br /><br />It smelled good, but when I poured cream in, went super white almost immediately, which usually means the k cup is not going to be a strong enough taste for me.  I want to find a Brooklyn Bean product I like, because they are very reasonably priced.  In any case, it won't be French Roast.  I poured it out.  Too weak for me on six ounce setting.<br /><br />Cyclone<br /><br />My son said I was going to like this one but he likes Starbucks blonde roast.  He really liked it.  I thought it was ok.  It didn't turn completely white with a bit of cream but it's just not full flavored enough for me.<br /><br />That said, I am sure someone who is not as into very strong coffee as me, will like it.  It's not bad, or anything, its just I am a Starbucks extra bold kind of girl, so remember that when you read my reviews.  Interesting though that two of my favourite K cups (other than double black diamond) are Caribou regular (I don't like the mahogany which is supposed to be stronger tasting) and the Eclipse, both of which are sort of medium smooth coffees.  Looking forward to trying and reviewing some more (I recently learned about reviewing on amazon when my cousin Joanne Levy wrote a book 'Small Medium at large' and I reviewed it because I liked it so much!

review/text: I was really hopeful to try a new brand of k-cups. These seemed like a decent price, and i figured that it would be tough to go wrong with a French Roast- worst case scenario would be that it would be more of a medium roast, but tolerable. It really is a light roast and very watery. If you are a fan of a bold French Roast, then this is not the coffee for you.

review/summary: Even Great In Utah!
review/text: My wife an I are pretty much hooked on these cups.  I was a skeptic at first I must admit.  I tried the San Fran cups, and didn't really go for their style.  I was getting tired of paying an arm and a leg for the main brands that got this whole biz going, so I tried these cups from Brooklyn Bean Roastery.  I originally ordered the Columbian blend, and admittedly I thought they were ok, I also thought they were a little weak for a Medium/Bold roast.  I reflected that in my original review of that one flavor.  The company immediately offered email assistance, to help me choose another flavor that would better meet my taste preferences.  I never did respond back to that request as I was not really looking for any assistance.  It was merely my first impression and observation.  I got through those cups and decided to give the Brooklyn Bridge roast a try.  I liked these much better.  Then it happened...  I had a couple of those cups more or less pop their tops in my coffee brewer.  It was a mess and a pain in the caboose to clean up.  I had known of other customers complain of the same issues, but again I reluctantly gave these a try hoping that would not happen to me.  Well, it did.  I then signaled the company with a review, reflecting what had happened, and the company immediately sprung to action again, wanting to resolve the issue I had, and desired to make me whole.  I never once thought that I would really get the attention that I got from the company, nor did I solicit any new product directly from the company.  It's like going to a grocery store, and buying any one of a myriad of items.  I believe that it is something you take an inherent risk, if you've never bought that item before.  If you don't like it, lesson learned.  You just probably don't buy it again.  You don't run back to the store, demanding a refund, or contact the manufacturer and expect anything.<br />Well, Brooklyn Bean emailed me, and basically summoned me to give them a detailed explanation of what happened, what cups I was using, the expiration date, which translates to the manufacture date, etc.  After giving them that requested info (I even sent them a photo of the messy exploded cup) they emailed me back and unexpectedly offered to send out new product.  I thought, Wow!  This company must be serious about making it in the business.  They are trying to make right, what had gone wrong, and at no expense to me, they sent out new product, and then some.  They sent out replacement cups, and also a 16 cup sampler pack.  We tried all of them and my wife fell in love with the Vanilla Skyline.  We have since ordered more product, including the Vanilla, and each cup has performed flawlessly!!!  I emailed the company and thanked them, and added that it surprised me that they would go to that effort for me, just one lousy customer in UTAH, and their response back was, how could a company NOT stand behind their product, and make it right, if they want to make it a successful company.  That is music to my ears!  I told them, that not every start up company would do that.<br />So, I highly recommend this product.  Find the flavor you like and run with it!!!

review/text: Brooklyn Beans coffee is really tasty.  I especially liked the Maple Sleigh, Fugghedaboutit, and Brooklyn Bridge.  My variety pack was a pretty good mix.  Thankfully it only had a couple decaf.  I had none of the breaking open problems that other people have talked about so I guess they must have fixed that.  I hope there will be packs listed in the future that let me get boxes of just the ones I really liked, which is kind of the point of trying a variety, I think.

review/summary: A great way to get your cookie fix.
review/text: A review for cookies?  Why not?<br /><br />My wife and I love Oreos.  Every once in a while she picks up a bag at the store and we eat some with milk.<br /><br />The problem is that we feel compelled to finish off the bag before they get stale.  Since all the kids are gone that's tough.  It's not really good for us and after 3 or 4 nights it gets kind of old.<br /><br />Recently she got a 12 pack assortment of cookies which contained Oreos, Nutter Butters, etc.  I wondered if there was a way to just buy a whole bunch of "snack packs" for Oreos and sure enough Amazon has them.<br /><br />Now we can have that 6 cookie "fix" without having to remember to pick them up at the store or worry about them going stale if we don't finish them off.

review/text: Three important details about me:<br />1. I have a ridiculously fast metabolism so I always want snacks.<br />2. I'm a student often stuck in long, boring lectures or labs.<br />3. I'm cheap.<br /><br />That's why I was so elated when I found this deal.  I already love Oreos and I'm always searching for small snacks I can shove in my backpack when I'm running out the door.  I tend to buy boxes of snacks and just cycle through them: peanut butter crackers, Nutty bars, bags of M&Ms, Moon Pies, etc.  The 48 pack of Oreos was my most recent one and definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />They're packaged pretty lightly in little bags of 6 Oreos and I find it to be the perfect amount so that I'm satiated but not wasting any due to losing taste.  One pack of 48 will last me at least a month (sometimes I eat two or three packs in a sitting, okay?) so Subscribe & Save seemed to be my perfect snack solution.<br /><br />Of course I didn't realize how much Subscribe & Save sucks.  The price on these literally doubled after my first month and I had to cancel my subscription.  That said, the product is great but don't trust subscribing through Amazon.

Its funny how Oreos have managed to hang on and become such a family favorite despite all the competition of much fancier cookies that are available.  No nugets going on here, chocolate bits, caramel, icing, or peanuts either.  Just a tasty chocolate cookie shell with a delicious vanilla filling.  Keeping it simple has been the best policy for Oreo lovers for decades now. These little packages contain Oreos that are a smidgen' smaller than the regular box or bag sized variety.  What the cookie and candy industry refers to as the fun size.  That might explain some of the negative comments as to these Oreos being rather cheap with the filling.  In my opinion the ratio is the same, they are just smaller.<br /><br />This 12 pack is an excellent buy on Amazon.  Buy two of them and you get free shipping and for the majority of us, no sales tax.  A fine buy if you have a lots of Oreo fiends in your home that prefer a measured amount of these great cookies.  Like a lot of other reviewers here I tend to eat less of them when they come in the little packages as such.  Great classic Oreo cookies at a good price.  Highly recommended...

review/summary: great for keeping family fingers out of the cookie jar
review/text: I love these 6 packs. I have three kids and I can easily make a snack bag for school with 2 each. And the benefit is there is not a bag left behind for mom and dad to graze on from the cookie jar. Great packagign for hiding in spots around house so the snack hungry teens do not eat them all in a day.

review/summary: Excellent sandwich cookie
review/text: Ok, for some of you (NAMELY Mr. A. H. of Detroit, Michigan), anything but a chocolate sandwich cookie, embossed with Nabisco symbols and filled with white creme is a travesty, but Golden Oreos are a worthy addition to the cookie line of Nabisco. These are vanilla cookies, slightly flavored with burnt sugar, filled with the familiar white creme.<br /><br />Unlike classic Oreos, the Golden version have not suffered much from having trans-fats removed. The cookie is still crisp enough and the flavor is the same. By contrast, original Oreos seem a bit softer due to the change in recipe.<br /><br />Another good feature is the fact that Golden Oreos don't leave a dark mess on your teeth. So you can eat one and not check yourself in a hand mirror afterwards if you are being in public. This is a very nice cookie with a cup of tea or coffee and a standard in our house for teatime or dessert.

The boxes were empty just sitting there all nice and neat.  I haven't ordered anymore.  I will make them wait a while, they was gone much too fast.<br />I guess I will break dowm and give them out for holloween.  I'll leave the empty boxes on the shelf too.) Ha ha.

review/summary: Hard to overdo it, with these prepacked snack packs
review/text: Each pack contains 6 Oreos.  That's a tidy size for someone who wants a little snack but tends to overdo it with a big bag of Oreos!  However, having 48 of these in the house has led all of us to a bit of Oreo gluttony.  You know how easy it is..."Oh, there's only 6, I'll have another pack."  As a result our box of 48 has barely lasted a month for three people.  So, I will probably not get this anymore because it's too tempting!

review/summary: Chocolate Cream Oreo Cookies 101
review/text: This is less of a review of the actual cookies; though I rated them 5 stars.  The real merit of this "review" is to provide  information that may help others avoid the confusion that I experienced when I received my order.<br /><br />I stumbled upon the product page on Amazon for "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream."  The Amazon product image clearly said "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream" and I had never seen that product description or package previously.  I had seen regular Chocolate Cream Oreos before and even original Double Stuf Oreos (with the white filling) in local grocery stores but never the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream.  I put my concern about the potential need to buy new pants aside and I ordered a case of 12 boxes, which is the minimum order.<br /><br />I received the case promptly from Amazon.  When I opened it, I found 12 boxes that simply said, "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  I uploaded a picture of what I received.  I called Amazon and told some nice representative in India that I received the familiar regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos that I have seen in stores and not the Double Stuf Chocolate Cream I had been expecting.  He apologized and shipped another case.<br /><br />I received another case today and it was the exact same product that I received a few days previously: "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  Instead of calling Amazon, I decided to call Nabisco (Kraft Foods, Inc.) for clarification.  The number is listed on the package 1800-622-4726.<br /><br />The following is probably the real virtue of this review.  I was told that the package now for the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream does not say "Double Stuf" anywhere.  As I mentioned, I uploaded an image of the Double Stuf product package that I received.  According to Kraft, the only way to tell is the UPC and package weight.  The package weight for Double Stuf Oreos is 1 pound 1 ounce.  The package weight for regular or normal stuf Oreos is apparently 15.6 oz.  The UPC for Double Stuf Oreos is 04472700.  The UPC for (regular stuf) Chocolate Cream Oreos is 044000025298.  Since the package does not say Double Stuf anymore, I am not even sure what my local grocery carries.  I need to check the package weight and UPC at the grocery store.<br /><br />Therefore before you jump, head-long, into buying 12 boxes of this magical Double Stuf Chocolate Cream, you may want to check what your local grocery store carries.  I really do not see the logic in having 2 different products with the same package, but there you go:  that is apparently the case with Double Stuf Chocolate Cream and regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos.  I will also mention that it would be interesting to see a side-by-side comparison of Double Stuf and regular Oreo cookies.  My guess is that the difference is not as significant as you might expect since I initially thought my cookies were regular stuf.

review/summary: not good
review/text: I'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you'll ever find, so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie.  The icing is the same, but the cookie part is soft and mushy like a moonpie.  You can't really dip these in milk because they fall apart.  Not recommended for those who grew up with the dippable kind of Oreo cookies (that being most of us).

review/summary: keeps cookies tasting fresh and crunchy
review/text: These are always going to be more expensive than buying the single big pack - remember when oreos were packed into three plastic tubes in a plastic box.<br /><br />These oreos always come out crunchy with a very pliable filling that can be easily nudged-rolled off if you don't like the filling.  If Nabisco sold individually wrapped cookies, I'd pay the extra money as I usually only want one cookie.<br /><br />I will always choose to buy oreos packaged in as small a serving as possible despite the expense unless I get some kind of vacuum sealer.

review/text: Great item at $16 (on sale).  My problem with supermarket packaging is the problem that the cookies taste great but once you open the package for about a week the cookies gets moist and taste not nearly as delicious as when the bag was open.  So these small packages, I think 6 cookies each is the perfect size.  They will all taste great and crisp.

review/text: My review is for the product cookie itself, not what might happen if you buy food from Amazon. Oreo is a classic cookie, and while I can't say that I am a big fan of all their flavors, I really enjoy three flavors - original, Uh-Oh Oreos, and the top of the list, Mint Oreos. The flavor is strongly reminiscent of the Thin Mint cookies sold by the Girls Scouts. Unfortunately, they only sell their cookies once in a while, but I can head to my store any time I have a craving for the flavor of chocolate and mint in a cookie. I even like this better than original Oreo, and that's saying a lot. Nom nom.

review/summary: Chocolate covered Oreo recipe
review/text: Everyone loves Oreos. They're even better dipped in chocolate. I made a plate of them for my son's Cub Scout cookie auction and a plate of my cookies sold for $20. So yummy.<br /><br />RECIPE<br /><br />2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips<br />2 tablespoons shortening<br />1 package Oreos<br />*optional: 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening<br /><br />**Before you begin, make sure everything is absolutely dry. Even a drop of water will ruin your creation.**<br /><br />Melt the chocolate chips with the shortening in the microwave for 1 minute. Stir until melted. If needed, heat another 10 seconds at a time until melted. Be careful not to burn the chocolate.<br /><br />Place one cookie in the chocolate and coat. Use a fork to scoop it out, tapping against the bowl and scraping the bottom of the fork on the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place on wax paper and let it set. Store refrigerated.<br /><br />Optional: To make it pretty, melt a cup of white chocolate with a tablespoon of shortening at 70% in the microwave for 1 minute. Dip a fork in the white chocolate and let it drizzle from the fork onto the semi-sweet chocolate covered cookies. If done neatly, your cookies will look beautiful.<br /><br />Hint: I do one batch in semi-sweet chocolate and one batch in white chocolate. Then, I drizzle the cookies with the alternate chocolate. Plate them together for an eye catching presentation.

review/summary: Mmmmmm, vanilla-y goodness
review/text: I second Joanna Daneman's observation that these golden Oreos are preferable to the regular chocolate Oreos when you are in public.  Oh, how many times have I enjoyed an Oreo milkshake on a hot day, only to smile widely at everyone with a mess of chocolate cookie in my teeth?  *shudders*<br /><br />So, only downside to the Golden Oreos is that I don't think they'd be as good in a milkshake as regular Oreos.  But the pluses are many with the Golden Oreos... a crisp vanilla cookie that is very good all on its own, but sweet biscuits and gravy, the vanilla cookies are paired with a sweet filling.  They are addictive.<br /><br />If you like vanilla sandwich cookies, try the Golden Oreos!

review/text: It is hard to imagine something as good as the original chocolate oreo.  That was in the days when Oreo only meant one thing:  Two chocolate wafers and vanilla cream.  The best way to eat those was to soak them until they were soft in ice cold milk (only could get whole milk back then).  Now there are how many things with the oreo name? TOO many.<br /><br />But this! The Golden Oreo.  Truly wonderful.  Totally different than the original oreo.  But wonderful. It is also BETTER than the current chocolate Oreo.  I wish I could taste-test the original oreo for comparison, but cannot be done...

review/summary: If you are into swooning...this one is for you.
review/text: Earl Gray is my tea of choice; my absolute favorite.  That being said, I have to further state that this Gourmet Earl Grey offered by Adagio is the best of the best!  The aroma is enough to make me swoon.  (Actually, I am pretty good at swooning and many things other than tea cause the condition...I would have made a great Victorian Lady...well, "Lady" may be a bit of a stretch, but at least Victorian would be appropriate).<br /><br />Anyway, loose leaf is always the way to go if you have the time and are so inclined.  I like mine on the rather strong side and must admit to enjoying the smell of it steeping almost as much as I enjoy the drinking of it.  The oil of bergamot is not at all overwhelming and is far superior to some of the stuff they add to tea these days...there is not after taste and the aroma does not linger for three days afterwards.<br /><br />Recommend this highly. The price here, when you consider the tax situation and the 50 mile drive I have to take to get to my source, is quite competitive.

review/text: I originally got this in the little Think Geek sampler, which contained four Adagio teas in bitty tins: Jasmine, Earl Grey, Blood Orange, and Chai.<br /><br />Every single one of those blew me away - I have never tasted loose leaf tea that is so flavorful and full of character.  The earl grey is a daily ritual for me, either hot, or in the iced tea I make that contains black tea and a hint of the earl grey or blood orange.<br /><br />The best part, is that I was worried about the price when I initially searched since it was so pricy on Think Geek, but 3 oz seems to be enough to fill like 6 of those tins I got - well worth the $5.<br /><br />Adagio has a customer for life!

review/summary: Woeber's Reserve  ~  Champagne Dill  Mustard
review/text: At my Grocer, I saw this one and only jar of this Woeber's Reserve Champagne Dill Mustard in an isle of unusual items, that they don't usually carry, that I've never seen before or since, kind of things.  On a fluke I decided to try this mustard.  It has champagne, white wine, and dill as part of the ingredients. I love to cook and in my experience, the dishes that I put wine or dill in have all gotten rave reviews, and I figured this combination would taste great! It Does!  Actually I could almost eat it alone with a spoon and I'm not really a mustard lover!  I've never heard of this company or item before, but I plan to try to order a case from their website on the label, [...].  Another good aspect of this mustard is that although it doesn't claim to be a "diet" food, it passes as a low calorie (5 calories per teaspoon, 0 fat and 0 saturated fat)condiment that really gives whatever you put it in or on, a heavenly flavor. It's very well balanced and smooth with lovely little pieces of dill throughout and doesn't have any heat or bite whatsoever.  Presently I am watching my fat and calories and was elated to find such a delicious condiment to spice things up. Late Last night I was a little hungry so I took 3 pieces of lean sandwich ham, coated each slice with a film of this champagne dill mustard and rolled each piece into a roll up and ate as a sort of finger food.  No bread needed on this sandwich!  It was super delicious!  Now I'm at my computer trying to find a case of this stuff to share with my besties! I will hid this one 4.5 oz jar in the back of the frig and use it sparingly till I find out if I can get some more! Try it if you can, you'll Love it!

review/summary: Herbalife Lift Off
review/text: I found this works best if you take it first thing in the morning before eating or having coffee.<br />In about an hour you feel an energy surge that lasts about 4 hours. At first I was taking it after breakfast, coffee, etc and didn't notice a difference, but on an empty stomach it's a lift off.

review/summary: Parle-G Gluco Biscuits - 1.99oz
review/text: Parle-G Glucose Biscuits received as ordered. Same as old, as we found in 1970s. For my personal taste, I re-heat to keep crispyness intact. Overall Good.

review/summary: Price is way off
review/text: I absolutley love these granola bars but you can buy them for $2.00/box (sometimes 1.88) at nearly every Wal-Mart.  To pay 6.00/box is rediculous!
