review/summary: Pretty good but too expensive
review/text: Prompt shipping. But at $20 a jar? Are you kidding me? I used to buy multiple jars to reduce overall shipping cost, but they have changed the product listing by raising the price to include the cost of shipping now. Ridiculous. This stuff makes a pretty good pie, but not worth it. I tried the Amish brand to save money, but all it is is colored corn starch. I threw the other jars away. Yuk. Barry Farms is still the better of the 2 product choices on Amazon. If you want a $20 too-sweet, mediocre pie. I wish I didn't love hard-to-get black raspberries so much.

review/text: I had learned about hulled millet when I participated in a week long cleansing and fasting program.  I went online and found an article that said to wet, then heat in a dry pan until the individual hull pops open and then continued until it slightly browns. After that you add water and continue to cook.  I added honey and cinnamon for flavor. The result is a wonderful flavorful grain that I mix with pieces of fruit and have for cereal many mornings.

review/summary: Grocery Shopping From Home
review/text: I love this product, as well as a number of other items I buy in bulk from Amazon. I live in a rural area where specialty grocery items are simply unavailable, and I count on finding what I like on-line. My first stop is always Amazon. A favorite brand is Bob's Red Mill -- anything they produce is quality, often organic, available in bulk in smaller packages for easy storage. Short grain brown rice is not to be found here, and that's what I particularly love, lots of it. A good buy, a good product, and easy!

review/summary: Short grain brown rice.. yay!
review/text: I have changed to a healthier way of eating so I had to give up white rice which as a Hispanic, is a basic staple in our diet. I found this rice in a discount store once and I liked it much better than the more commonly sold long grain. I find this short grain cooks a lot softer than the long and medium grain rice. Amazon sold this for about the same price as Bob's Red River but without the exorbitant shipping charges. I was thrilled to be able to use the super saver shipping option which shipped for $-0-.  You can find everything on Amazon.com. Makes my life much easier.

review/summary: I love cream soda, but not this cream soda.
review/text: I was looking to treat myself to some cream soda I had not yet tried, so I chose Blue Sky cream soda.  I love Virgil's cream soda, and Boylan's, even Sioux City is pretty good.  For me the Blue Sky brand was very artificial tasting.  I can't say it tasted quite like a diet soda even though it wasn't diet, but it had more artificial flavor than cream flavor.  I only use the word diet because it didn't taste like a regular sugary soft drink.  Some people may actually like that.  I don't.  I ended up giving it to a friend after deciding I couldn't drink it.  He likes it just fine.

review/summary: If you like a dark roast coffee, Bluff Blend is as good as it gets.
review/text: I used to live in the Magnolia neighborhood of Seattle and this is the coffee I drank every morning.  I've always enjoyed rich, bold dark roasts and this is the best I've ever found.  It has a slightly smoky taste and is very intense, but it doesn't taste burnt or sour, like a lot of dark roasted coffees.<br /><br />Also, if you're ever in Seattle, find one of their shops and try an Appassionato Mocha, made with Dilletante Chocolate's Ephemere dark chocolate sauce.  Absolutely to die for!  Unlike most mochas, this isn't overly sweet and neither flavor overpowers the other, they complement and enhance each other perfectly.  The feel of the drink in your mouth isn't gritty or cloyingly syrupy, but smooth and substantial.  The cup has the lovely smell of lush, sensuous, dark chocolate and freshly roasted coffee.  A real treat for all of the senses.  I love my coffee and Appassionato is the best, bar none.

review/summary: Great tasting cappucino in a convenience can
review/text: This is cappuccino in an 8.45 oz can, just a bit more than a regular 12 oz soda can. You won't get the, "You got milk mustache" or some cute latte art, but you can really taste a nice combination of strong coffee flavor and milk - tastes great. 100 calories.<br /><br />The milk comes from rBST free cows (I first had to Google it to know what it means), meaning no injection with artificial hormones to increase production of milk. RBST is already banned in Canada, Japan, New Zealand, etc., but not in the US yet.<br /><br />Not better than the hot cappuccino served with the traditional atmosphere, but if you need to run, you can just grab one and throw it in you bag.<br /><br />Product of Denmark.

review/text: Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids. To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: After my family became ill from eating bacteria infected salad greens bought at our local grocery store, I went to .fda.gov/Safety/Recalls and found out how much of our produce is being recalled......after they have been shipped, purchased, and eaten. What a shock!<br />So, I've looked at the cute electric over engineered and highly expensive gourmet salad growing machines.  And compared the cost to the tried and true sprouts.<br />These sprouts were very viable, I didn't see any that didn't sprout.  They aren't finicky about their growing condition, I just threw mine in a mason jar, didn't even dig my old sprouting trays out of the store room.  The seeds sprouted right away, and this is November so it's coolish in my kitchen.  I've tasted them as the seeds sprouted and found them very tasty from the moment they sprouted, to the point where they were big enough to classify as a "salad".  These may be a bit pricey, but the nearest Whole Foods market is too far away for convenience.  I will check on the sprouting seed price the next time I'm across town and update on the price comparison.

review/summary: A Big Ripoff!
review/text: I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back.

review/summary: Top quality and great for sensitive stomach!
review/text: My pitbull puppy (10 months old) has a sensitive stomach - it is common in the breed.  She would get terrible gas with normal "puppy" dry food and sometimes throw up.  I was a little worried about trying the Bil-Jac food because I've heard that it is not good to change up the food too quickly or too often.  However, we just switched it over one day (after getting a free coupon from BzzzAgent) and she ate it with absolutely no problem!  Not only that, she hasn't had any gas!  She hasn't had any stomach problems or anything to indicate sensitivity!  This food is incredible.  It is expensive, but really worth it for the health of your pet.  I highly recommend!<br /><br />*I bought the food at Petco and they didn't have the large breed puppy formula in the size that I needed, so I got this one instead.  Still a fantastic choice and well-loved by my puppy. :)

review/summary: Indispensible in the kitchen!
review/text: This broth has been a staple in my pantry for about five years now.  I use it in soups, stews, pilafs, casseroles, mashed potatoes, curries, sauces and more.  Because I use so much of it I was pleased to find that I could get it in quantity and also in powder form, which is easier to deal with than the cubes when using large quantities.  I am no longer a strict vegetarian but still eat like one for the most part, and while I can use this to fine effect in dishes containing meat, fish or poultry, it is nice to know that I can easily acommodate my vegan and vegetarian friends with few or no adjustments to my recipes by using this instead of non-veg broths as a seasoning staple.  Couldn't do without it!

Don't get me wrong, this is a fine product but if you want more flavor, less salt, go for Seitenbacher (I wrote a more in depth review on that product's page).

review/summary: Natural Fresh Taste!
review/text: It is second nature for me to check ingredients before purchasing a product.  I am pleased overall with the ingredient listing of this product and really like the taste.  I am not sure where they get their yeast extract because this term can be a "hidden" form of MSG, but have not had a problem using this product.  The corn ingredient is organic, so I am willing to think it not GMO.  I was very glad to see they use sea salt. The fact they use sea salt was one of the reasons I bought this product. Rapunzel products are very tasty and, in my opinion, one of the best for making a good soup or broth.<br /><br />Many people avoid salt thinking it is a good thing. The harmful "salt" to avoid is the product we grew up with, you know, the "salts" in boxes off the grocery store shelf. The body doesn't recognize or break down the heated, hardened crystals of these unnatural, refined so-called salts. The salts found in nature will quickly dissolve in liquids and are recognized and used by the body.  Sea salts, Himalayan salts, etc. also contain minerals and are beneficial and I have used these "real" salts with no problem at all for many years.  Do some research on the internet and discover the healing properties of natural salts.

It's very smooth and has a nice pumpkin flavor.  It gets better as it cools.  The clove flavor is only slighty noticeable which is a very good thing.  The flavor was pretty close to pumpkin pie.  This would mix really well with a good french vanilla kcup and some cinnamon.  The flavor is light years better than the Green Mountain pumpkin spice kcup. It took me a year to get through that box.  I threw out the last few.

review/summary: Want your dog dead?  If so, buy this product!
review/text: I was in a hurry as I shopped at my local pet food store late on a Saturday night.  My dogs needed dog food.  I buy a high quality dog food, it's ingredients contain everything my vet wants me to be feeding me dogs. I also wanted to get them some special treats. But in my haste I picked up a bag of these "gourmet" chicken breast treats.  Usually I read the label on everything I give my dogs.  Not this time, they looked healthy and were very similar to other chicken breast treats I normally buy.  Had I carefully read the back of the bag I would have immediately returned them to the shelf and moved on.  The words on the back of the bag "not for human consumption, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling this product"-"made in China" would have tipped me off!!!  I never saw these warnings until after my beloved jack russell became very ill only mere hours after eating one of these treats.  My vet wanted to know what had she eaten that was different?  I handed him the bag-he looked it over in horror.  My dog developed an obstruction from the treat, which caused bloat because nothing could pass, salmonella and e-coli poisoning, and an infection in her heart giving her a 4/6 heart murmur.  She had to undergo expoloratory surgery, 7 sets of xrays, 2 ultrasounds, multiple blood tests,an ecg and we're not done yet.  She is still in recovery, tests still pending.  This was one of the healthiest dogs my vet cared for before this incident.  Never had a health issue in the past, never a heart murmur.  At 9 years old most people thought she was 3 or 4.  I have been told the heart murmur has been caused by the infection settling in her heart, which is now irreversable.  Which means if she makes it through all of this her life expectancy just went from 16+ to 10 or 11.<br />My vet cultured one of the treats and could not believe what disease and bacteria it was loaded with.  I cannot believe I took such good care of her for 9 years and then put her through all of this suffering because I didn't take the time to carefully look the product over. Thank you, Cadet and IMS Pet Products for contributing to my dog's pain and suffering.

review/text: I was shocked to see that these are selling for over $15 on Amazon.  My local grocery store carries this exact same product for $8.99!  The product itself gets 20 stars because my Beagles literally dance for them... but the pricing gets a big BOO!  I always shop Amazon because I know I can get terrific prices, that's why I was surprised.

review/text: Nina is in love with the Chicken breasts.  Every time she gets one, she jumps into her bed to savor it. She has a very delicate stomach and when she was diagnosed with gastrointestinal problems, we were concerned that she would never enjoy treats again.  What started as a trial became a standard purchasing item.  We give her no more than 3-4 per week and so far, so great.  The treat smells very good and it does justice to the "natural" descriptive.

review/summary: Delicous strong coffee
review/text: I turn into [more of] a raving maniac when the tin goes empty.<br /><br />For my morning coffee, I use a french press with three scoops of this stuff. True, it results in far more caffeine than my nervous system would like to deal with - but it's so good! This is a coffee that you can chew; it's got a kick to it without the trouble of going to a coffee shop and without the expense.<br /><br />I am not a self described coffee connoisseur - I don't make espressos, I don't use a fancy pants machine, nor do I know whether this is a good espresso coffee or not. But I can say that I am generally disgusted by what gas stations, Dunkin Donuts, Folgers, and most places in general try to pass off as "coffee". If I wanted to drink something watery, I'd have a cup of tea!<br /><br />If you like a hearty coffee without all the fanfare of the premium stuff, give Cafe Bustelo a shot.

review/text: For you coffee connoisseurs out there, here is the bold, smooth flavor you've been waiting for. My husband asked me for something robust b/c he kept coming up empty.  Having grown up with this coffee I was quite familiar with it but with the advent of gourmet prepared coffee a l&agrave; Starbucks, I'd forgotten all about it.  When, I looked at our monthly bank statement an looked at our expenditure.  I decided it was time to brew at home (Keurig anyone?).  I went to the local supermarket and actually ended up throwing away a freshly ground 5 lb bag b/c it smelled well but tasted awfully.  I remembered what he asked for: bold, smooth, tasty. Bustelo! I went to my local supermarket and found it.  I said "Give it a try and if you don't like it - then I'll buy the $14 Juan Valdez bag".  He absolutely loved it!  After not tasting it for about 10 years, I forgot what I was missing.  This is a MUST TRY for any coffee lover.

The brownies turn out chewy and chocolaty and rich -- perfect straight out of the pan, or with a scoop of ice cream for a heavenly dessert. In fact, when we're having guests for dinner and I am in a hurry, I turn to the Ghirardelli brownies. Everybody always loves them. Nobody would ever guess they are from a mix. You can't go wrong with this product. Be careful and don't overbake them. Leave them a little soft and chewy for the best result.  You can also freeze the leftover brownies and defrost and heat them in the microwave. Works great. I keep this mix on hand all the time. You never know when you're gonna need a warm brownie!

review/text: This blend is one of Starbucks' gentler blends, but you have to like the taste of Starbucks to appreciate it.  Often described as having a burnt taste, Starbucks beans are known for their strongly roasted taste.  Maxwell House afficionados should steer clear.<p>Before you invest in Starbucks coffee, make sure you like the flavor by tasting the brew at a local franchise.  If you don't have one near you, make sure you like a strong coffee flavor.  Although I enjoy Starbucks coffee myself, I am leery of recommending it to the uninitiated.  If you like the taste, stock up now.  The coffee stores well for months in the freezer.

review/summary: Okay coffee
review/text: This is a basic medium, morning coffee.  Amazon ran it about a month ago at $12.40, including super saver shipping, for the three packages of coffee.  At that price, it is a good buy; I personally would not pay more than that, nor will I probably order this brand again, only because it's just okay.  Amazon also sent me ground coffee, not beans.  If you are insistent on grinding your own beans, just check the shipment before you open it.  The three packages will come shrink wrapped, and I had mine open before I noticed that the packages were ground not beans. I'm sure that if I had complained to Amazon, they would have replaced the shipment, at their expense, because they do not take back food.  However, I will drink just about anything in the morning, and this coffee is passable, but nothing special. I also keep my coffee in the freezer until using it to preserve freshness and flavor.

I have only drank it hot so far (it is winter which may be why it was on sale) but can imagine it iced for the summer. It smells wonderful! The packet size is 1 oz and it says that is one serving, however I am getting 2-3 servings from a packet. It uses organic cane sugar and I think a packet is high in sugars at 23g. I would love to try the other flavors. Some of them sound wonderful and if the flavor is anything like this, I'm in! Heat the water, toss the powder in (to taste), and it is ready to go.

I tried it for the first time a few months ago and I prefer to cook it in water, like oatmeal, maybe adding some raisins and sweetening with brown sugar.  You don't gobble it down as fast as oatmeal with its interesting lightly crunchy texture, yet it holds together like cooked oats.  Leaves you feeling more satisfied then common modern day cooked cereal.  I had a different brand which tasted "too" natural, like a weedy "old" corn taste, but this brand has a pleasant good tasting slightly-corn like flavor.

review/text: I have ordered Kitchens of India products before (butter chicken and the rajma masala kidney bean curry) and have been pleased. Due to the good reviews for this product and my previous experiences with KoI, I didn't hesitate to purchase this.<br /><br />However, it's not really what I had expected. It's not as good as the butter chicken paste is, nor does it smell as good. This chicken curry paste is also VERY salty; I had to add more rice and vegetables to my bowl because I couldn't handle the salt. The flavor is strong, though not spicy, and I think that the butter chicken is much more balanced in terms of spices and flavor and I wish that I had purchased that instead.<br /><br />Still, this is easy and quick to prepare and while it doesn't taste great it's still decent, which warrants its 3 stars.

review/text: As the title says, it's very easy, very good, very quick to use.<br /><br />I don't always even put chicken in, veggies alone taste good!<br /><br />I take one cup of water and the paste packet and put on high stirring until dissolved (less than 1 minute).  Add pieces of chicken, whole with bone, or boneless cubed into liquid to cover.  I then add whatever veggies I want from a frozen bag...  cauliflower, okra, peas, even a can of chickpeas works well.  Cover and cook until veggies are tender and chicken is cooked, 15-30 minutes.  Serve over rice.  I eat flour tortillas as a quick alternative to roti bread.  Just throw the tortilla on the gas stove burner, and flip every 5 seconds until blackened on the corners a bit.

review/summary: Makes delicious curry in the crock pot!
review/text: I love these curry packets!  I crave Indian food often, and this really satisfies that urge.<br /><br />I use them in the crock pot, which makes for a ridiculously easy and delicious meal.  I'll use skinless chicken thighs and dump the curry paste on top, then I'll fill the foil packet with water and add that as well.  Near the end of the cooking time, I'll add a defrosted box of spinach, and then I'll serve the curried chicken and spinach over rice.<br /><br />Interestingly, my husband -- who isn't a huge fan of Indian food -- likes this as much as I do.

review/summary: Good but not spicy enough.
review/text: I wanted some spicier curry and this flavor is just a tad spicy.<br />My recipe:<br />Brown chicken in a separate pan(seasoned with salt/black pepper/sugar) and set aside.<br />Brown potatoes (cut in big bite size pieces) and pour over chicken.<br />Brown chopped garlic, red onion (cut up anyway you like), 1 red & 1 green bell pepper (cut up anyway you like).<br />Add one cup of plain yogurt or coconut milk.<br />Add one package of curry.<br />Add some crushed red pepper to curry if you want spicier.<br />Add one cup of water or less to your preference.<br />Simmer mixture a couple of minutes.<br />Pour mixture over chicken & potatoes, cover and simmer about 30 minutes.<br /><br />Pour over rice and serve.  :)

review/summary: My Favorite
review/text: This is probably one of my favorite curries, even compared to restaurants I've eaten at.  I would recommend cooking it in whole pieces for the first 20 minutes and then cutting it into smaller pieces before cooking it the remaining 5 minutes.  It's been my experience that the chicken will be overcooked if you cube it first.

review/summary: tasty, fragrant, and no harder than macaroni and cheese
review/text: No "real" Indian cook would do anything but use all individual spices to make a curry - ha!  "Real Indian cooks" use spice mixtures like garam masala all the time.<br /><br />This is more than just spices, like curry powder.  It has onions, lime, and so forth.  As soon as I opened the packet, my wife began craving naan, Indian bread - the fragrance was just wonderful, and reminiscent of what you smell in an Indian Restaurant.<br /><br />I used about two pounds of chicken with bones and skin on to one packet, browned the chicken very lightly, and added the packet of paste.  I should have poured off some chicken fat before adding the paste.  Then I added about 2.5 cups of water and simmered for about a half hour covered, and gave it more than 5 minutes on high - basically I was just judging the reduction - I stirred about once a minute during that part.<br /><br />In the meantime, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0022SZGZM">Wolfgang Puck WPPCR005 5-Quart Electronic Pressure Cooker</a> was working on the rice.  The rice was done well before the 25 minute period was up.<br /><br />There are some great ideas in these reviews.  I have used a peeler on zuccini and yellow squash to make thin sheets of vegetable for sauteing, peeling all the way through the veggie - I would do that while the stuff was cooking for 25 minutes and add it just as you entered the "five minutes on high" period, add some to the sauce and turn it - I think it would taste great.  For the first batch I was just getting a baseline.  Yogurt was a good idea, maybe a little sour cream? Or heavy cream?<br /><br />Eggplant is another classic veggie that goes into curry. Of course, you can make homemade Indian cheese - you take a bunch of cow's milk, curdle it with lemon juice, yogurt or cultured buttermilk, and strain it in cheesecloth, three layers, pressing it under a plate that is weighted with a bowl of water after it drains to form it - look for recipes for paneer or panir on food.com.<br /><br />The point is that letting a butcher cube your chicken and mixing cubed chicken with water and this paste, simmering for 30 min, boil on high uncovered for 5 minutes, let sit for three - that is the basics and you can do so much more.  I argue that it is not harder to make a simple chicken curry using this paste than macaroni and cheese. I think the curry tastes better - your 3 year old may disagree :-).<br /><br />But the paste is essentially a spice and flavoring mixture.  If you love mixing and matching - if you always have onion soup mix in your pantry and have never made onion soup, well, this could be a winner.  I've taken a course in Indian Cooking at the CIA in Hyde Park, NY. I still have a mortar and pestle n my kitchen, because to do it "right" you need to grind your spices and it is marginally better to use a crushing mortar than a chopper grinder.  And you need about half a dozen reasonably fresh spices - cumin, cardamom (green and black) and black peppercorn, mustard seed and oil to make a spice cake, coriander, tumeric, nutmeg, cinnamon, dried ginger (I don't grind this myself), dried chili -  there is an article in wikipedia that lists many Indian spices.  You want to grind the spices the day you use them, in most cases.<br /><br />Most people (me, these days) are unwilling to do this, so they take shortcuts.<br /><br />This is a shortcut.  And the flavor is as good as I've ever had in a premix like this.  I've had worse in restaurants.<br /><br />My wife has a very, very low tolerance for picante food (spicy hot).  She found the curry spicy and tolerable - she felt that the food was spicy hot but it was not at all intolerable.<br /><br />I have a high tolerance for heat.  I found the "hot" spiciness almost unnoticeable, while the rest of the spicing was bold and simple but not excessive for Indian food, (where they use a lot more spice in one dish than, say, the City of Cleveland, Ohio does in a week). The flavors were simple, and no one flavor predominated.  The spicy flavor penetrated the entire piece of chicken during the cooking - this was true of both the thighs and the whole split breast that I used.<br /><br />If you want a spice mixture that makes a good simple curry and is easy to use, and you are willing to forgo the subtle but sublime feeling of accomplishment that you get when you perfectly create something so tasty that it gets you high while you are eating it, if you are willing to "settle" for good, tasty food, this curry paste is a good choice.<br /><br />Yes, there is Indian food like that, I cooked it when I was in that class and for some time after, but I'm older and my new wife likes Indian food some but not all that much, so this is perfect.  I don't consider that the point of this product - that you can hand spice something so that it is better than a commercial curry does not reflect badly on this product at all - this is five star curry paste.

review/text: Great!  My husband and I love it.  I coarsely chop an sweet onion and start cooking it first.  Then add the chicken, paste and water.  At the end of the 25 minutes I add a splash of cream or half and half or non-fat half and half.  Just a little to make it creamy.  Then some frozen peas.  It is great over brown rice, but white will do in a pinch.  Leftover curry keeps well in the fridge and we just re-heat in the microwave.

review/summary: A Good, Mild Curry That Is Easy to Make...
review/text: The standard curry Paste by Kitchens of India (KoI) makes for a quick and easy method to making a rich and flavorful curry.  To make the curry it is a simple process that only takes me no more than 30 minutes to make.  Throw about 1.0 lbs of chicken in a pan (you could use fish or vegetables if you want).  Add the entire packet of paste + 1 cup of water.  Just mix until the paste blends with the water and dissolves and well there you go!  Just simmer for about 20-25 minutes before turning the heat up to high for about 3-5 minutes and you are done.  A delicious curry with chicken(or vegetable/fish) in under 30 minutes.<br /><br />The curry itself tastes best when hot, in my opinion.  There is a mild spice to this curry and while it is a good quality product, this curry also tends to taste a little on the salty side.  It is also a bit sweeter than the other chicken curry that KoI sells (Butter Chicken Curry).  While I do enjoy this curry it is not my favorite.  That goes to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V17MLS">Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry</a> which has a bit more spice to it.<br /><br />OVERALL this is a good curry that doesn't have too big of a bite in terms of spice.  It has rich flavor and can go best with chicken, though vegetables and fish also work well for this curry.  Being easy to make in under 30 minutes, this is a good mild curry that will not disappoint.<br /><br />* Nutritional Information ** (Entire packet)<br />Each packet is 3.5oz (100g) and contains FOUR Servings.

review/summary: Not too bad, needs a little improvement
review/text: As I was cooking this I was instantly amazed at how good it smelled and started to really crave the taste.  However, as a few others have mentioned the Chicken curry paste had way too much of something that I couldn't determine.  Some have said salty and others cloves, but whatever it is it was just too overpowering and needs to be balanced out.  It wasn't too spicy at all.  I have 5 packets left so I will experiment.  Next time I will use two cups of water instead of one, hoping that will mellow out the saltiness, but I'm afraid that will dilute the rest of the flavor.  We will see.<br /><br />All in all the flavor was good, and preparation was easy so 3 stars.  If they can fix the overpowering flavor this would be 4.5-5 stars.<br /><br />I have noticed others saying the Butter Chicken is much more balanced and very good so I look forward to trying that out next since I bought that also.<br /><br />Also, I did have the Kashmiri Basmati Rice Pilaf with Vegetables & Nuts and that was great, and so simple to fix, takes 3 minutes.

review/text: I bought this item as I was having difficulty getting my regular brand of curry paste which I have been using for the last 4 years.  I was so pleased with it that I am not going back to my original brand.  You can either prepare it simply as directed on the box, or you could elaborate it a little by frying some diced onions in a pan at the beginning and adding a vegetable near the end.  We like adding mushrooms, but you could add almost any thing.  The fresh cilantro garnish at the end is a must.  It really gives the curry a wonderful flavor.

Still a good product but the taste is somehow "off" from many of their other products.<br />I've rated it 3 stars since the texture, packaging, instructions, etc were all great and my overall success with their other products.

This one is saltier and spicier than the butter chicken, but it depends on your taste - I much prefer this one. I also prefer chicken thighs, with or without bone, tho definitely without skin as thighs are already fatty. Add one of their vegetable sides (ready in 10 min), rice, and you're done. Or get fancy and serve chutney. Or go multinational and serve cole slaw, perfect with this stuff. In our family, it is approved from ages 3 thru 94.

review/summary: great curry with some modification
review/text: I have modified the instructions to adjust it to the kind of Asian curry that I am used to.  Instead of adding 1 cup of water, I have added one cup of coconut milk with one cup of water - or you can use normal reduced or whole milk. It adds flavor and dilute the salty taste.  On top of that, I added some spice chillie (sambal chilie available at most Asian grocery).  It adds spice to the otherwise bland, salty curry.<br /><br />The paste is much faster short cut to making authentic curry. It's easily done.  You can use the paste for other spicy dishes and not restricted to just curry.  eg. curry fried noodles, or use it to season chicken wings for bbq etc ... at amazon subscription price, it's a great deal.

review/summary: Decent but could be better
review/text: I got my packets in a few days ago and I decided to make one today.  Directions were simple and easy.  I even added a few veggies to go along with the mixture.<br /><br />My end product wasn't as juicy as the picture on the box but I like it a bit dry anyway.  I saw a review that complained about too much salt.  Indeed it is a bit salty (especially if you taste the curry mixture alone) but I found the end product to be manageable.<br /><br />The taste is why this product doesn't receive 5 stars.  I expected a curry taste to match products I eat at Indian restaurants but this one was slightly different.  I've made homemade mixtures that taste better.  It was still good but I found myself getting tired of the taste as I became more full.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying this specific product again but I may see if they have other options.

review/text: I usually buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V17MLS">Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, but thought I'd try this one.  I am a bit disappointed because I don't think it's as good.  However, I would not characterize it as bad either. It has a slight clove-ish flavor to it that I do not find unpleasant. Those who like really hot curry will probably want to add some chili flakes to it.<br /><br />When making the KOI curries I add more meat than the recipe calls for, which extends the dish without loss of flavor.  I usually serve this over rice, but I think it's good also with potatoes and peas.  Skipping the chicken altogether, this curry paste could easily be used to make a very good vegetarian curry.<br /><br />I will buy this again.

No more frozen curry any more - yeah!

review/text: Very authentic tasting and esy to use.  As others have noted you really can substitute this curry past for any curry.  You can even add a can of coconut cream and, mmmmmmm, it takes it to another level instantly!

review/summary: Excellent curry paste for everything
review/text: I've made butter chicken and keemah (lean grounded turkey) w/ peas and this paste is great. For the keemah dish, I use half packet just to give flavor. Aside adding a little chili and onions, you don't need anything else.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: This tastes very good and it's very easy to make.<br /><br />I didn't like this as much as I liked the Butter Chicken Curry, though (also from Kitchens Of India).  The Butter Chicken Curry is WONDERFUL.  This one has a darker heavier flavor to me.  But, we did still enjoy it very much.

review/summary: Tasty and Easy
review/text: Simply put these packets are easy to use and yield a good result when you want Indian in a pinch. I modified the recipe on the packet by adding chopped onion and some leftover roasted potatoes making the result more of a complete meal.  The salt content is a little high but overall the quality is excellent for a concentrate.

review/text: Any negative reviews you find of this product would have to be from Indian restaurants worried about losing business! I don't review many things, but was so impressed with the flavor and ease of use of this product... will now be a major staple of our kitchen!

review/summary: Better than the Restaraunts!
review/text: When you love Indian food, but don't have the time to cook it, Kitchens of India is a really great alternative. I have yet to be disappointed in one of their dishes and this one is no exception. Plus, many of them include Classical Indian Music CDs that are extremely good.

review/summary: Tastes good, small packet
review/text: These tastes good, but just know that each bag is  for cooking one pound of meat. It is much less than the packets we generally get from asian grocery stores which generally are for 3-5 lbs of meat. The weight of the product is clearly in the ad, but at least I did not make the connection till I got the packets home and saw how small they were.<br /><br />Perfect for cooking  2 organic chicken breasts, but if you want 2 of chicken hormone and antibiotic fed chicken breast,  you need at least 2 packets.

review/summary: Amazingly easy way to prepare chicken
review/text: I'm a bit fickle with Chicken. If it tastes even a little bit off I can lose my appetite for it. This paste makes a sauce that is quick and easy to make. Most of all, I like how the recipe makes sure the Chicken is COOKED by bringing it to a boil twice. And it tastes great over rice. I can't give it 5 stars because it doesn't measure up to the best curry I've ever tasted, but it's good enough that I have bought a couple 6-packs so far.

review/summary: Not my taste
review/text: I ordered this from Amazon like 6 months ago and I still have 3 packs remaining. I am an Indian and love chicken curry but I'm sorry to say that this prodduct was a complete disappointment. I have had other products from KoI. The paste is not spicy at all- rather bland. It seems to be missing some of the spices needed to make it taste Indian.<br />Not recommended especially if you've had authentic Indian curry in India.

review/summary: Not up to our taste
review/text: I ordered several 6 pks. thinking this was going to be great teasting and it was terrible...very strong tasting. My husband is Indian and we both love curry. I made the Chicken Curry with the paste accoring to directions and it tasted stale & flat for lack of a bettr description. Of course we have eaten some of the best chicken curry around so maybe that is why we did not like it. Also the rice mix was the absolute worst, gummy and stuck together..ended up tossing the entire purchase.

review/text: I made a chicken curry with this and was quite pleased.  I first microwaved the chicken then cut it up and finished the cooking in the paste.<br /><br />I've had better at restaurants, but this is quality for the price and ease.
