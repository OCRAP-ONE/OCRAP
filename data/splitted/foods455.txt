review/summary: 5 pounds of excellent gummi bears
review/text: Monetarily it's a fair deal, not extraordinary.. but fair. Take a moment and think about yourself. You are reading a review about gummi bears. Clearly you are the type of person who would find a 5 pound box of Haribo Gummi's to be a wonderful thing. And it is.

review/summary: Haribo Gold Bears 5-pound bag
review/text: It would have been good for me to know the ingredients prior to purchasing. I expected the German-made version which has real fruit extracts. This 5-pound bag is from Hungary and contains artificial and "natural" flavors instead. The difference in taste is noticeable, not to mention the obvious advantage for one's health to have something with real fruit rather than something with flavor.<br /><br />On a side note, expect to pay a lot for shipping. There appears to be no land option, airmail only. But, that might depend on whether you live in the same country as the retailer or not.<br />I realized after the purchase that I would save 30-40% by purchasing the small bags at a local store that imports them from Germany.

review/text: These are kind of hit and miss.  The first time I bought them, they were great, I bought two five pound bags, and they were great.  A second order and they were pretty stale.  Some more consistency would be nice...  Might be better to just buy them at your local supermarket or drugstore...

review/text: Great product but Amazon has these way too expensive.  You can get a 5 ounce bags at Kmart or Walmart for $0.99 per back which 5 lbs translates to $16.00.  For $2.00 more for 5 pounds, I'd rather have small convienient bags.  But these are by far the best gummi's out there!

My kids know I am addicted because I have to have some hidden for just one of those days.  They are easy to find here where I live and as others have said, they are all over Europe. My daughter spent the summmer there taking classes and brought some home from Vienna and Croatia.  I buy them at Wal-Mart but the 5-pound bag is just the best deal I have found....no more having to worry about running out too soon.  It's too bad these have calories because they are like chips, you can't eat just one! :)

Great deal right now, and with 2 bags, you get free shipping! I got regular gummi bears and cola bottles, and I think my husband ate more of them than I did and he isn't a big gummi fan! He said they were just good, fresh, and had a great flavorful taste, not like any other gummis that are just colored shaped goo.

review/summary: Best gummy bears around, but they give your jaw a work-out.
review/text: Just like everyone else here it seems, I first experienced Haribo's magic in Germany.  I was at a train station and I needed a quick snack, so I bought a little bag of the Gold-Bears.  Ever since I ventured to find them in the States, but couldn't.  A few years ago, however, I noticed them popping up in their little bags, and had to buy one.<br />While they're still the best gummy bears Stateside, I was a bit disappointed since they were harder than I had them in Deutschland.  But that's understandable, as I'm assuming they're imported from Germany, and gummy bears really can't retain their freshness for long when traveling across the sea, and then sitting on a store shelf waiting for someone to buy them.  They're not hard-hard like some of the other gummy bear brands you'll find here; they're just harder than in Europe.<br /><br />The flavors are strong and fantastic, and I have to stop from eating so many gummies at once for fear of my jaw getting sore--but they're so good!<br /><br />The 5lb bag is a great deal, but just be sure no one else is around.  I already had a bunch of co-workers coming up to get some, assuming they'll last forever since it's a large bag.  After ordering this about 2 weeks ago, I'm already having to consider reordering a second bag!

review/summary: I am addicted!
review/text: I think it was five years ago when I ate my first Ginger Creme.  I must go through a box a week: Summer or Winter, it makes no difference. My biggest mistake is that I let my wife try one and now I have to create my private stash so that when the overwhelming urge is on me - I can get my hit.  A typical hit is three.  I can get by with two, but one is simply never ever sufficient and only serves to whet the appetite.  I sometimes nibble a couple with a small glass of good Malt at night.<br /><br />One of the few benefits of living in Masachusetts is that my local grocery chain carries these on a regular basis - at only $2.50 a box!! Costco also carries them periodically - which is when I really stock up.  Last Christmas many people received a 3-pack for Christmas - alas they have not appeared at Costco this year so people will be bitterly disappointed this year.<br /><br />While I am at it - you should also try the equally addictive Carr's Cheese Melts perhaps with a touch of Major Grey's chutney - adding cheese is definitely overkill and detracts from the cracker!  In a pinch, when the cupboard is bare and the supermarket is closed, they might even substitute for a ginger creme.<br /><br />Please note: I have no financial interest in Carr's - just the desire to ensure that the demand is sufficient so that my supply will go on forever.

The cookie has an absolutely delightful crunch - it's not an overly-dense cookie and then you get to the lemon center with a perfect balance of sweet and tart.  You are forewarned.

review/summary: carr's cookies
review/text: Originally discovered these cookies at Costco. Costco discontinued carrying them. I was pleased to see that I could find these on Amazon and at such a great price. Without the shipping chage this was an excellent value. I have many of these fine cookies to enjoy for the months ahead.

review/text: As other reviewers have pointed out, these are great cookies.  The lemon and ginger flavors are perfectly combined.  The only reason not to buy these cookies is because you fear the potential weight gain these addictive cookies might lead to.  That said, these are worth working out a little more for.

review/summary: Superb Quality and Price, Though Not the Cheapest Around
review/text: A pound of crystallized ginger can be made to go a long way, and we made this pound last about 4-5 months by chopping the round slices into dices, transferring it to the freezer in resealable sandwich bags, then using it over time to make about 4 batches of Ginger Snap cookies.<br /><br />If you'd like to make more than that, or get more ginger for half the price, you'll want to checkout the 6-pounder (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UXY2J2?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8) from Roland. Both are about equal as far as visual and cooking quality, but Roland is about half the cost per pound.<br /><br />Frontier's crystalized ginger was a bit stiff and woody, meaning it was likely left in the ground too long before harvested. While the cookie quality was decent, I wouldn't recommend it for raw consumption.<br /><br />Ideal ginger (crystallized or not) should be tender. Try the stuff from Australia (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G818BQ?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8) for some of the finest consumption-quality ginger around, but do know that it's spicy no matter the origin. (Hey, they don't call it a spice for no reason!)<br /><br />Hot Tip: Discovery Channel's Mythbusters proved that ginger is an exceptional remedy for motion sickness. It WORKED when practically no man-made remedy did! Amazing.

review/summary: Very Good Quality But Too Expensive
review/text: I'll always try to support a "Made In USA" product and/or a product distributed by a US business but the price/ounce for this product is high. Quality is very good. If you use Thyme Leaf in larger volumes go with the Frontier brand available here at Amazon. Two 1lb bags (32oz total) for about $17.00 currently and less with Subscribe & Save. That's a lot of product but it's also very good quality. I gave one bag to a friend of mine who owns a commercial bakery and he's hooked on Frontier now.<br />Again, if you only need an ounce for occasional home cooking this product is fine, and you're supporting a US business.

review/text: I love Gerber organic products like this which combine veggies and/or fruits. I bought one of the "Farmers Market" from the regular grocery store to make sure my 8 month old liked it, which he did. I bought a case from Amazon, but the consistency was like soup, very runny unlike the one I bought from the store. Heating it up made it worse. Maybe it was a fluke, but the second case from Amazon ordered a few months later had the same problem.

review/text: To me these are just average.  They're not great, and there's nothing off-putting about them.  They're the medium size fishies that get called "sardines", and not the more expensive tiny fishes (which taste better in my opinion), and not the herring that show up in the really cheap sardine cans.<br /><br />The easy-open can is a great idea.  No more splattering tomato sauce over myself when despite my best efforts to open a metal can correctly I just don't do it with quite the right touch.<br /><br />The problem is that I've been spoiled by the little sardines, and I just can't see myself staying with these.  I'll finish off what I bought (and enjoy those easy-open cans, but I won't buy them again.

review/text: I have never purchased wheat berries to grind into flour before. I did my research to make sure I could handle the task well. Before milling this wheat I took out a cup full at a time and examined it carefully for dirt, stone, bugs, etc. This grain was perfect! It was pristine clean, no rocks or dirt, and no bugs. I was super pleased and then I milled the grain into a wonderful flour and baked up a loaf of bread that rose beautifully and tastes like a million bucks! So very happy with this wheat. I will be purchasing more very soon!

review/summary: Easier to use than expected
review/text: I wanted to try grinding wheat and also wanted to get more whole wheat in my diet so I decided to try this out.  So far, I've been very impressed.<br /><br />How I use it:<br />1) Grind it using a Blendtec blender (I set it to the maximum speed and let it run to duration, 50 seconds.  I repeat this once).  By the time the Blendtec is done it is very fine though not quite as white/'pure' as store bought white flour (but I guess that's kind of the point)<br />2) Mix it in with whatever I'm baking.<br />-I haven't tried using only this flour in recipes.  I typically substitute between 1/3 and 1/2 of the flour in a recipe with this flour.<br />-It has worked great for breadmaker bread, pancakes and cupcakes.<br /><br />In using about 1/4 of the bag so far, I did find one of the little black balls that another reviewer mentioned but that has been the only 'imperfection' that I've seen.<br /><br />I'm certainly planning on getting more when this is finished, the Amazon price isn't too bad and the wheat seems great!

review/summary: Little black balls/seeds (smut balls) throughout!
review/text: So I dump my bag of wheat into my existing half full wheat bucket and find the package littered with what seems to be little black seeds of some sort- definitly not wheat!!! Not bugs- but perfectly shaped little black balls.  I have looked for an answer online with no luck...I tried calling the manufacture and the office was closed- I have yeast proofing on the counter that I now have to dump- and my good wheat is now mixed in with the "bad".....so basically I'm out of dinner, and money.  Only alot annoyed at this point.<br /><br />***Okay this is an add on to the original post- Looks like it's something called smut balls.....a dried fungus ball.  Not toxic- as far as I can see.  But still is considered an unpure grain.  I don't see why I should pay top dollar for less than quality grain and that I paid for weight with these included (i'm guessing 4-5 lbs worth mixed in).  I could sit and pick out millions of these tiny things or just figure out how to get a refund (p.s....i have no idea how I'm going to repackage it for the return).  I will not be a return customer of this product unless it is shown to have improvement.

review/text: Hamburger Helper Stroganoff / B0010VO7HA<br /><br />I've loved Hamburger Helper Stroganoff for years, and I am excited to see it on Amazon available in bulk quantities for cheaper than the supermarket price. The pasta is easy to make, just brown the ground beef, dump everything into a pot, boil, cover, and simmer undisturbed while you go do something more useful than standing at the stove.<br /><br />The stroganoff is thick, creamy, and yet relatively `light' tasting - 1 cup of prepared stroganoff is approximately 0.5 grams of fat, according to the nutrition facts on the box. I always cut back on the meat - it calls for a pound of meat, but half or even a third of a pound is plenty for me. I use organic whole milk and unsalted butter and the result is a creamy deliciousness that I don't feel too terribly guilty about. I think the result would even be good without meat - for the vegetarians out there - if you wanted to experiment.<br /><br />I'm really pleased to be able to order this on Amazon - the bulk ordering is cheaper and I don't have to lug it home from the store, which saves gasoline money. The boxes come tightly packaged in the box to prevent spillage, and the expiration dates on the boxes aren't too close - the last order I received in September, with a "best if used by" date of the upcoming January. Although, really, I don't think Hamburger Helper is terribly perishable.<br /><br />This product, according to the ingredients list, contains wheat, milk, soy, and egg products, in case you might be allergic.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: Very Good Stroganoff
review/text: I have looked for this particular Hamburger Helper for years since moving from California to where I am.  The stores here just never carried it.  Now that I can obtain it we have really enjoyed it.  I don't use hamburger in it, I use canned roast beef including all the gravy and it makes a wonderful side dish or main dish with salad.

review/summary: BAD! JUST PLAIN BAD!!!
review/text: We might not be a gourmet club, but we know when something looks and tastes like wall paper paste. (And please don't get us started on the strange smell!)<br /><br />I have used Hamburger Helper for years (admittedly not that often) but had never before used the Stroganoff variety. Well... we will never, ever use it again. What a waste of perfectly good beef. And, FYI, I thoroughly followed the directions, and used fresh, lean hamburger purchased only an hour before. (Honest!)<br /><br />Gross.

review/summary: Bland
review/text: This beef stroganoff mix is not bad--just bland, not a particularly tasty use of a pound of ground beef and a container of fresh mushrooms.  I thought it was worth trying because it's cheap and it's available in my local grocery stores. The stroganoff mix I'm comparing it to, Annie's Homegrown Organic, is less convenient for me; I have to order in bulk from Amazon or stock up when out of town.  And the Annie's mix is a bit more than twice as expensive.  Whether a box meal is organic isn't important to me, so I'm not taking that into account.  But considering flavor vs. convenience and cost, I think that the Annie's mix is the better value.  Of course, taste is a personal thing--this is just my view.  Here is the link for the Annie's mix:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y2CI9U">Annie's Homegrown Organic Beef Stroganoff Skillet Meal, 6.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Refrigerator Helper
review/text: I like having Betty Crocker Helper mixes in the pantry. They come in really handy on grocery shopping day. Inevitably there will be something that needs to be used up fast to make room for the newer product in the fridge. Usually it's the last of the milk. Sometimes it's the last stick of butter, or the last packet of cheese. Even leftover meat and vegetables can go in there. There is always something. Betty Crocker pasta meals are awesome for making those odds and ends disappear. The Helpers kind of need doctoring anyway, so the odds and ends wind up well used, and the Helpers are so cheap it makes sense to use them as a recipe starter. The Stroganoff is one of my favorites, partly because I like Stroganoff but also because it's an easy way to get rid of the last of the sour cream. Truthfully, all of the Helpers are great for using up odds and ends, but I'm nostalgically fond of the beef ones.

review/text: As the previous reviewer indicated, it does look ground but when you put it into the dish and separate it, you can tell that it is indeed flaked.  I brought this one home on a fluke and wow, did it disappear quickly.  My rescued Persian never had anything like it before and just didn't quite know what to do with this food.  She loved it so much, she just came up and purred all night after eating it.  Looked like she just had Thanksgiving dinner.  She rolled over on her back, burped soundly, and took a very long snoozer.  And did I see a smile on her face?  Looked like it to me! Great, great selection, highly recommend!

review/summary: Nice Tea
review/text: The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's Lemon Chamomile tea is a nice and pleasant-tasting tea for unwinding and relaxing. The lemongrass was picked in Thailand (lemongrass is widely used in Thailand for many cooking recipes). I order any product from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf online since there are no Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf stores near where I live. If you want to try other excellent teas from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, try these two Limited Edition teas sold directly from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's website, Spring Peach Oolong and Blueberry Peach Green Tea. The Spring Peach Oolong was grown 5,000 feet above sea level in the mountains of Thailand and the Blueberry Peach Green Tea was grown 1,200 meters above sea level in the Mae Salong region of Thailand. Besides the three teas I've mentioned from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, I also highly recommend their special Dutch Chocolate Powder, Vanilla Caramel flavored coffee, Raspberry Cream flavored coffee, and Limited Edition Blueberry Streusel flavored coffee. In summary, this is a great chamomile tea. Another great chamomile tea to try is Fairmont Egyptian Chamomile. I was introduced to the Fairmont Egyptian Chamomile tea in 2010 when my sister and I dined at the Fairmont Dallas Hotel's Pyramid restaurant (a restaurant with a fresh market concept and with the largest hotel/restaurant herb and vegetable garden in the Dallas region). I visited the Fairmont Dallas Hotel's gift shop and they had an excellent array of organic teas with their Egyptian Chamomile being one of them. The Egyptian Chamomile has a nice sweet taste and it's sold on fairmontstore.com in their online gift store, the tea section. I strongly recommend the Fairmont's Organic Hawaiian Kei Lani Orange Pineapple, Organic Chinese Jasmine Butterfly #1, and Organic U.S.A.'S Cascade Peppermint teas. Anyways, I'm glad that this Lemon Chamomile tea from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is available for purchase on Amazon. I think it's a great economical deal to purchase this from Amazon - you get a pack of three containers (each containing 20 tea bags). I have one container at home, one at my workplace, and I gave one container to my sister. I'm satisfied with this purchase.

review/text: Since they love all things potato and sweet potato, I knew the girls would like these snacks. They're a nice small size and thin in the middle so I thought it would be an easy thing to break the individual bones in half. Not!<br />These are tough, chewy little bones; giving a whole treat to one of our small-mouthed girls might be the equivalent to giving her a stick of gum.<br />Thus I cut these treats up into little pieces  for the girls. They like these bones quite a bit and look forward to them. Larger, less fussy dogs might not need to have their treats cut first.<br /><br />Be aware that these treats are made in China.

review/text: I saw this new flavor in my local store last week and thought it sounded good, so I bought a box. OMG!!! When I took the first bite, one thing came to mind...This tastes just like a Samoas Girl Scout cookie (my fav)!<br /><br />Every year I buy 10+ boxes of the Samoas, this year I'm trying to loose about 30lbs. I thought cookie-selling time would tempt me, but now I'm not worried. These things are delicious and completely replace my desire for the Samoas.

review/summary: A great alternative..
review/text: Samoas are my favorite girl scout cookies; however, it comes with minimal nutritional benefits.  That goes without saying of course since it's not a 'health' food. Enter the FiberPlus bar with caramel, coconut, and fudge.  In my opinion, the bars are delicious and closely resembles the taste of the Samoa, while offering 35% of the daily fiber.  The following is a summary of the nutritional information:<br /><br />Samoas<br />Serving Size: 2 Cookies (29g)<br />Calories: 140<br />Total Fat: 7g (11%)<br />Saturated Fat: 5g (25%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 1g (5%)<br />Sugars: 10g<br /><br />FiberPlus<br />Serving Size 1 bar (36g)<br />Calories: 120<br />Total fat: 4g (6%)<br />Saturated Fat: 3g (15%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 9g (35%)<br />Sugars 7g<br /><br />As noted above, the FiberPlus bar is far superior to the Samoa in every category, in addition to being larger in size (36g vs 29g serving size).  I still purchase Samoas for its unique taste and once-in-a-while treat, but now I can actually enjoy fiber bars on a daily basis for my in between meals.  I highly recommend this product.

review/text: These bars used to taste like Samoas, BUT a few days ago I bought a new box. The bars taste different. The box is flimsy and difficult to open, too.<br /><br />My neighbor first mentioned the bars don't taste like Samoas anymore. Today another friend said she bought two boxes, and the bars don't taste like Samoas.<br /><br />New bars have less chocolate on top.  I compared wrappers on old and new bars.  Old bars have 120 calories, 6 percent of carbs, 20 percent of zinc.  New bars have 130 calories, 9 percent of carbs, 25 percent of zinc.  Could these differences change the taste?<br /><br />Has anyone else noticed a change, or are my friends and I crazy? Thanks.

review/text: I've got a small poodle-mix. I've tried almost every premium food for my dog. With completely grain free foods, I've seen the coat dry out and become dull. Solid Gold produced too much gas. Canidae ALF and grain-free went too stale for her taste in less than two weeks. The other foods I've attempted simply were rejected.<br /><br />Wellness Small Breed to me is a miracle. She will even eat it without having to load it up with cheese. Her coat is a shiny silver. She's actually grown a healthy undercoat. Like most little dogs with allergies, I've noticed the eye discharge is minimal compared to other foods.<br /><br />So for any super-finicky small dog parent, I would definitely recommend this kibble.

review/summary: My picky dogs eats every piece!
review/text: I have a three year old yorkipoo who has always been extremely picky about his food.  We had some success (by "some success" I mean he'd eat half of what he was supposed to) with the Prarie brand by Natures Variety, but he always had runny eye problems and had trouble keeping weight on.  My mother's vet recommended the Wellness brand for her dog to lose weight and suggested I try the small breed formula for my picky dog. I'm so glad I tried it! Since switching my dog to the Wellness small breed formula my dog eats every single piece.  I don't have to sit there and encourage him to eat. He willingly eats the whole bowl and cannot wait for his next meal. I'm convinced that I could feed him 5 times a day and he'd still eat every last piece because its just that good. I have never seen him so excited to eat! On top of this his coat is as soft as ever and his watery, running, cloudy eyes are completely clear. He has the same amount of small dog energy but doesn't seem as anxious when I leave (apparently filler in dog foods can cause anxiety in sensitive dogs).  I'm amazed at how great this product is working for my little man. Highly recommend for those with picky, small breed dogs.

review/summary: One of the best dog food you can buy for the price
review/text: Ok let me clarify first of all, why I gave it 4/5 instead of 5/5.<br /><br />If it were to up to me alone, this food is 5/5.<br />The ONLY reason why I took 1 star off, is because my dogs hate the taste :(<br />I have a Pomeranian and a Maltese. Both of them would often just sniff the food, and walk away. They will eventually eat it when they are really hungry, but they just look very disinterested in the food overall. I have the same issue with Blue Buffalo.<br />However, when I alternate them to Orijen, or Taste of the Wild, or Acana, or Fromm, they pretty much gobble them down instantly. (I tend to alternate around different brands and flavors just to make sure they are not deficient in a specific nutrient/mineral).<br />This *small* problem is NOT universal. I have friends whose dogs love this food, and I have seen dogs that absolutely won't touch Wellness. Every dog has its preferences, so its best to experiment around.<br /><br />However, I like feeding my dogs WELLNESS most.<br />Their poop is solid and doesn't stink, and based upon the ingredients list, it seems really good!<br />No by-products<br />No corn<br />No fillers (well except for tomato pomace, which some people consider it as a filler. I personally don't)<br />Omega 3 and 6 levels are on the higher side (which is a big plus!) compared to other brands/foods!!! ^_^<br /><br />I have fed about 2 bags so far, and my dogs haven't had any health problems.<br /><br />Only thing I wish the product can improve, is to maybe include Chicken Fat, instead of using Canola Oil. That will probably make the taste much better for my dogs making them much more interested in it. Canola oil is a cheaper alternative, but its really not a biggie.<br /><br />This is definitely something I recommend to include in your feeding rotation!<br /><br />On the sidenote: if you do not want to risk having a 15 pound bag of food that your dog hates, contact Wellness for a sample! They will send a 4oz packet to you, so you can "test" if your dog likes it.

review/text: I have been trying to find a nutritious food for my picky 6 pound, 1 year old, terrier/poodle/mutt and runt of the litter. Went through Puppy Chow, generic puppy chow, and Iams and then I started reading up on dog foods- and boy, did I learn a lot! No more grocery store food unless it is an "emergency" where getting online is not possible or we run out before the shipment arrives. That stuff is pure crap.<br /><br />We then went through a bag of Orijen, which I think is an excellent food, but not for her. She would eat it with toppings only and rarely ate all of it. Stools were often loose- not to mention the gas.<br /><br />A tiny dog can only eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of food per day so he/she needs to eat it all and it needs to be packed with nutrition. Back to the drawing board since the Orijen didn't work!<br /><br />Next we tried the Wellness Super5Mix Adult Small Breed. She eats every bite and licks the dish and sometimes wants an evening snack of the plain Wellness kibble. She eats it without any topping but I do usually mix in a TBS of wet food (or cottage cheese) which Wellness recommends in order to give the dog a bit of extra fluid. We live in the desert, so that's important. Anyway, she REALLY loves that! She has cleaned her plate twice daily ever since I started her on this wonderful food. The stools are formed and no gas.<br /><br />It seems to be the perfect food for her- and maybe for other dogs too which is why I am writing this. It is such a relief to see her eating a good nutritious dog food and enjoying it.<br /><br />I would definitely give it a try if your dog has "pickyness"/appetite/digestion issues, or if you just want to provide 4 star nutrition. It costs more than the grocery store stuff, but a small dog doesn't eat much so I make it fit into my budget. I try to include it in with the occasional larger Amazon order and get  free shipping. It may be available in pet stores as well, but I have to go 15-20 miles out of town to find a pet store, so ordering online is easier.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this food.

review/summary: every dog deserves to eat well
review/text: i have two yorkies, one weighs six pounds and the other weighs sixteen pounds.  i started them out on the puppy formula and then gradually onto the adult small breed.  the quality of the food is good and i like that the bits of kibble are small enough for my little dog, but hearty enough for my big boy.  my vet recommended dry kibble over wet dog food since it keeps their teeth cleaner which is important to me.  it may be more expensive than the brands available at the local grocery store or walmart, but my dogs are certainly worth it!!
