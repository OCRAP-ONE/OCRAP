review/summary: Chocolate Lover - Chips Ahoy Chewey Gooey Hater
review/text: I am a sucker for all things chocolate, and fudge-anything is even more decadently delicious. I jumped at the chance to try these new Chips Ahoy cookies and was extremely disappointed when I didn't like them. The cookie is very similar to those large Grandma's two-pack Fudge Choco-Chip you get from vending machines, but with a fudge-like stuff cocooned in the middle and surrounded by a thin crispy substance (may be sugar, may be white chocolate?).<br /><br />In describing them, they sound delish, but my first-bite impression is a processed and overly-salty flavor that hides the chocolate goodness. At 150 calories every 2 cookies, I'd rather get my choco-fix from a Hershey bar.<br /><br />On the plus side, the new resealable package is great, and keeps you from having to slide the tray out to access a couple of cookies, much less messy!<br /><br />I'm sure there are people that love these, but in my opinion, if you're looking for real old-fashioned fudge flavor, these won't satisfy.

review/summary: Wet Bread Mouthfeel
review/text: Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge / B004U49QU2<br /><br />I received these cookies and their non-chocolate counterparts at the same time, and I'm a little disappointed with both.<br /><br />I was skeptical that packaged cookies would be soft, but these cookies actually are very soft around the edges. Unfortunately, the mouth-feel is very unpleasant to me: they feel a little like wet bread in my mouth. Once the edges have fallen off, you hit the center core of fudge -- it's basically a hard chocolate disk inside the cookie that needs warming for a second or two in the microwave beforehand.<br /><br />These aren't the worst cookies I've ever eaten, but I didn't enjoy them at all and really wanted to throw them away after the first few had been eaten -- there's a strange aftertaste that I don't much care for. There's also a bit of a "fake chocolate" smell to the cookies that is unpleasant -- my husband took one sniff of each package and refused to try any, saying that they "smelled bad".<br /><br />I really like the idea these cookies represent, and I hope that Chips Ahoy can get the recipe right in their next attempt -- it's a good idea, but just doesn't quite come together in execution.<br /><br />NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: Chewy If Not Gooey
review/text: Well, I wouldn't really call these soft cookies "gooey", but they are chewy and plenty chocolatey.<br /><br />In short, I think these will appeal to chocoholics who don't mind the host of chemical additives listed in the ingredients.<br /><br />If I'm understanding Amazon's pricing correctly, however, each 10-ounce package costs a little more than $4.<br /><br />Zowie -- a family of chocoholics can easily devour that package in one brief sitting.<br /><br />Well, as the French, say: "chacun a son 'goo'"...

review/summary: Strange texture
review/text: I believe they wanted this cookie to taste like a brownie. I am so used to Chips Ahoy having that subtle choco flavor with a crisp bite that this cookie surprised me. It is gooey as stated on the package but the texture is awful. Enough for me and my daughter not to finish our cookies. We love cookies so you know that this was not a good one if we did not finish it! The taste is not a brownie taste. Can't even explain it. I am sure they are trying to branch out with more choices but how did this one pass their focus groups??

review/text: I must admit that I was really excited to try these cookies.  I love Chocolate.  What could be better than extra ooey, gooey chocolate, right?<br /><br />Honestly, I was not impressed.  They seem dry and kind of fake tasting.  They aren't horrible but definitely not as good as they sounded.  I think I will stick with regular Chips Ahoy from now on.

review/summary: Bland, Cookie Dough-Like Concoction That Tastes Low-Fat But They're Not!
review/text: My husband and I are chocoholics. The minute I saw the word "megafudge" I envisioned rich, gooey chocolate melting in my mouth. Sadly, this was not the case. The cookies taste rather dry, they aren't particularly sweet and each one left a strange chalky aftertaste in my mouth. The texture is more like cookie dough than fudge. The little white chocolate chips sprinkled into each cookie don't have any flavor to them. If you had told me these were reduced fat cookies, like SnackWells, I would have believed you. Since they're not, I'd rather indulge in something that actually tastes good since my waistline will be paying for it!

review/summary: Yuck! fake, preservative taste.
review/text: These cookies are small, and initially taste good but then after you swallow you realize there's an odd aftertaste.  It's a strong chemical, preservative type flavor.  The kids wouldn't even eat any more, they said they'd just eat another one to get the fake taste out of there mouth but then they'd have it again.  The chocolate megafudge tastes like burnt coffee or bad grape juice.  They're just awful cookies, very small and lots of calories. Skip these.

review/text: These new cookies by Nabisco won't be purchased by my wife or I unless there is a special clearance sale.  There is an aftertaste in each bite that left me and my kids wondering if we'd just brushed our teeth.  The gooey center was more like a thin film of fudge, and nothing gushed out like the picture led us to believe.  The cookies are very thin, and not worth the caloric intake.

review/summary: not that great...
review/text: Nabisco has come out with several good products lately.  This, unfortunately, is not one of them.  I recently tried a crispy cranberry-orange cookie of theirs that was one of the best tasting things I've ever had in my entire life... and I'm OLD (53).  These cookies are surprisingly small in diameter (between 1 1/2 and 2 inches).  I was expecting three inch wide cookies (what I'd consider "normal" for this type of product).  In the end though, the size doesn't matter (!) - they just don't taste very good.  I love chocolate, but I'd take those cranberry based cookies any day instead of these.

review/summary: More Cakey than Chewy
review/text: OK, so these cookies are good.  But they are not really fresh out of the oven, purchased at a coffee shop or deli fresh made chewy cookies ... in order to replicate that, I am pretty sure some chemicals come in to play - and at best these are more cakey than chewy.  I like them, BUT food is by all definitions a matter of taste.  So ... to see if my tastes match yours, let me give you some reference points:<br /><br />My favorite cookies are Mint Oreos, Girl Scout Samoas, and those crazy pink and white frosted animal crackers ... mmmmmmmmm goooooood.  To me, these Chewy Chips Ahoy are not as good as those.<br /><br />My good friend LOVES Oreo Cakesters - and she LOVED these. - So, if you really like the Oreo Cakesters, these will be right up your ally.

review/text: I have never met a cookie I didn't like and this is no exception.  It's loaded with chocolate and is very very soft. It's more like a flattened brownie then a cookie. My only complaint is that it is a high calorie snack per small serving and they are messy, they fell apart when you touch them.

review/text: The Chips Ahoy cookies ARE chewy and gooey (at least a little bit gooey), rather than crunchy. But while they are very chocolaty, they seem to have an artificial chocolate flavor that I did not particularly enjoy. At 75 calories per cookie, there are a lot of other cookies I'd rather spend my calories eating ...<br /><br />I did enjoy the self-closing packaging though, which at least keep the cookies from getting stale.

review/text: These cookies taste very yummy!  My whole entire family loves them but I'm not digging the calories.  1 serving size is 2 of these cookies and that is 150 calories so 75 calories per cookie.  They're not very big so it seems pretty high to me.<br /><br />My daughter and I think these cookies taste like a brownie with a yummy fudge filling inside.  I'd agree with the reviewers who state that they aren't very "gooey" but regardless they are still really good.<br /><br />If you're not on a diet or concerned about calories then I'd highly recommend these cookies but if you're trying to diet then these cookies may be too much of a temptation.  You may eat more than just 1 or 2 and it can kill a diet.

review/summary: Soft liquidy Fudge Rush!
review/text: "Nabisco Fudge Filled Soft Cookies: CHIPS AHOY! Chewy Gooey Megafudge"  9with both white and chocolate chips) in a lift-resealable package.  At first bite a little dry tasting, each time I started eating I hesitated a bit in liking it initially:  initially a little `crystalic', but once the tongue gets the soft filling - then a very enjoyable chocolate-fudge high rush.  Soft fudgy-choc filling, nice firm chunky choc chips, very rich choc flavors.  Then the cookie hits back of throat - a fine choc-fudge taste is extended! I wanted to wash it down with milk, but I resisted the temptation as I wanted to keep that good, DEEP RICH flavorful choc-fudge taste to `hold'  in the mouth for several minutes.  The cookie's outside is firm, but yet soft - somewhat like a crystallized shell - which once bitten through gets to the forbidden soft Fudge elixir.  After one, I had to down another two in a row.  (disclaimer:  I did receive a free package of this cookie for review.)

review/text: I'm a chocoholic and liked the taste plus the fact that it's a soft cookie.  I barely noticed the fudge in the middle.  I can't eat too many at once since they are so chocolaty.  The easy-to-reseal package was an improvement.  I kept half and gave the rest to my son to take home with him in the package.  He said they made it there ok without spilling and still fresh after a few days.  I might buy these in the future when I need a chocolate rush.

A bit too sweet for my taste, but my husband, who still has the taste buds of a kid, gives them two thumbs up. Pretty good for a store-bought cookie, and a little bit of an upgrade from regular Chips Ahoy. Another cool thing is the package that seals itself back up.

This was the ultimate taste test. I asked my 4 year old twins if they liked them more than chocolate chip and they said yes. Now I have another thing to bribe them with to improve their behavior.<br /><br />I like the Chips Ahoy resealable packaging - this really helps to keep the soft cookies soft and fresh.<br /><br />The cookies are small, the same size as regular chips ahoy. This is good if you're working on portion control.

review/summary: Not Homemade, but Intriguing
review/text: When I was a child, I loved chewy Chips Ahoy cookies, but when I stopped eating them for a few years and tasted them again, I found them not to be tempting at all.  They had a strange chemical taste that wasn't appealing.  These cookies, while they definitely have a hint of an artificial flavor of some kind, are significantly better, and I recommend them for someone who needs chocolate in a hurry.  The cookie itself is fine - soft enough to be chewy, hard enough that most of the cookies don't fall apart - but the real draw of this new cookie is the chocolate goo in the center.  I tasted five or six cookies in a row, and each one was consistent, with a truly indulgent pool of fudge encased in a delicate crunchy layer, like the candy shell on an M&M.  The contrasting textures in each bite of cookie (chewy cookie, crisp border, then luxurious goo) make for an entertaining snack that pleases the senses.  If the cookie itself had tasted a little more like a homemade cookie, then I would have awarded this product five stars, but what I tasted was definitely worth recommending to any chocolate lover who likes a texturally entertaining sweet.

Before I received them, I had bought some large brownie-like cookies at Whole Foods and hoped these Megafudge cookies would even outshine those. However, nope, it didn't happen. The Chips Ahoy! cookies were smaller than I'd thought from the description, some of their centers didn't taste very gooey and were almost indistinguishable from the outer layer, and they had a slight chemical/manufactured aftertaste. That said, as a chocoholic, this is still a cookie I might buy on occasion, depsite the calories. But perhaps Chips Ahoy! could revamp this recipe for a more natural taste? That could tempt me to be a regular customer of this product.

review/summary: Not Bad for an Industrial Techno-Cookie
review/text: You can do a lot worse in the category of corporate-branded, machine-stamped, focus-tested, baked-by-the-gazillion cookies. This Chips Ahoy variant (and there must be a dozen by now; the brand has been extended from here to Mars) is chewy and rich, compulsively consumable, with a pleasant aroma and authentic-feeling aftertaste. They are smaller than you'd expect, though (which is probably a good thing) and at only 18 to a package you can eat a whole sack, absent-mindedly, between Alex Trebek introducing his contestants and teeing up Final Jeopardy. And whatever that chocolatey fluid is that spills across your tongue as you chew, it's not fudge. It's not bad, but it's not fudge. Fudge doesn't have the viscosity of Pepto-Bismol. "Megafudge" is a made-up word for good reason, methinks.<br /><br />The thing is that at 3.5 grams of saturated fat and 75 calories PER COOKIE, you have to consider whether this is the best way to indulge yourself. You can have a big, fresh bakery cookie six inches across instead of gobbling six or eight of these... and almost certainly do less damage.<br /><br />These cookies taste good but they're pretty poor value and nutritionally disastrous.

It's solid enough to not drip on your clothes.<br /><br />When I get home from work I'm going to put this in my fudge swirl vanille ice cream and see how that taste.

review/text: I consider myself a cookie expert.  I usually make my own cookies but on occasion when the cupboards are bare I will buy store-bought.  These Chips Ahoy are full of chocolate in the filling and the dough.  They taste great in MHO. Two cookies are 150 calories which is somewhat high (since the cookies are somewhat small). That's why I deducted one star.  When I make my own cookies I know the ingredients that go into them.  And my cookies have fewer calories.  But if my cupboards become bare again I would consider buying these in a pinch. :)

review/summary: Cookies are good, but high calories make this an occasional treat only
review/text: I received the cookies today.  The flavor is certainly fudgy, albeit a little on the dry side.  I don't eat a lot of cookies so it may be some preservatives that cause the dryness, but either way it isn't a deal breaker.  The white chocolate chips break up the fudginess well.  The problem is, 2 cookies are 150 calories.  I ate about 7 and that could easily be a decent size meal.  Fat calories per serving are 60 calories, which is not too bad, but these are definitely not for the health conscious.  Still, even with high calories, these are preferable to some low fat alternatives out there, which pack on sugar and salt in fat's place.  Please, just don't go overboard on them if you are concerned about your weight.  7 cookies doesn't seem like a lot, but just think- 7 cookies = 525 calories!  That's the equivalent of a good size burger at a fast food chain.

The Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are all chocolate, with a chocolate fudgy center and white and dark chocolate chips.  They remind me of Soft Batch cookies made by Keebler.

The stats are not great and not horrible for a cookie: 2 cookies 150 cal, 7g fat, 3.5 sat. fat, 13g sugar.  They are an indulgence and a yummy one at that.  Give them a try!

review/text: Chips Ahoy - Chewy Megafudge Cookies<br /><br />2 cookies/31 gr -150 calories<br />7g fat<br />Sat fat  -3.5g<br />110 mg Sodium<br /><br />This is going to sound a bit like a schizophrenic sort of a  review, since I both liked this product for some aspects and disliked it for others.<br /> This product certainly delivers what it claims.  It is rich and fudgy, with a yummy creamy center and nice bits of chocolate pieces, both regular chocolate and white pieces. While you would never ever mistake this for a homemade cookie, it can be an interesting addition to your lunch or a snack.<br /><br />It has a somewhat pleasant taste and texture, but unfortunately, for some reason the initial bite into the first cookie seemed taste `salty' (although by the second cookie that taste seems to disappear).<br />My biggest disappointment is that for such tiny cookies there is such a large caloric intake. The filling could have been a little less creamy and a little more fudge like, since it oozes out of the cookie while biting into it.<br /><br />Delivery via UPS didn't seem to harm the cookies any; at least no more than the typical breakage when buying cookies at the grocery store.

review/summary: It's good-n-gooey brownie-like cookie snack - Chips Ahoy style.
review/text: I grew up eating Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies. They were the only and the best chocolate-chip cookies ever...until I grew up and realized there is better out there. I still enjoy Chips Ahoy!, but every time I eat them, it's never the same enjoyment I had as a kid. I guess my taste buds grew up.<br /><br />Eating Chips Ahoy Megafudge Gooey gives me the same experience. It's luscious in it's own right...the Chips Ahoy way. Chips Ahoy! Megafudge Gooey is like a chocolate chocolate-chip cookie and brownie hybrid. It eats like a soft cookie, it's tasty like a brownie, and it's fudgy goodness is a mix of both. I love the gooey fudge - that 's what really makes these cookies pop.<br /><br />As usual, these cookies taste best with milk. Kids will probably enjoy these cookies better than the adults who've tasted better and know better. However, there's just something about Chips Ahoy cookies that make you come back for more even if it's not the greatest cookie in the world. It's still Chips Ahoy! It's the familiar fun snacking cookie that even adults enjoy if you don't take your cookies and chocolate too serious.<br /><br />For Chips Ahoy! this deserves 5 stars. I think they really got something yummy here for their brand and I hope they keep it around.<br /><br />However, in comparison to other cookies out there...3 stars. Good but not great. Yummy, but you know there's better out there.

It's a chocolate lover's paradise, and really the only Chips Ahoy! cookie I've ever liked to this extent. Though I know they make the soft variety, normally the crispy is in our pantry - mostly because I'm afraid I'd eat all the soft. The crispy just don't do it for me, but this cookie - Oh my God!<br /><br />Chocolate lovers, those who dream of fudge encased in soft, chewy cookie, this is for you. And we will DEFINITELY buy these at the grocery store, though I may have to put a lock on the pantry doors.<br /><br />Excellent!

review/summary: A Descent Tasting Cookie that Still Disappoints ...
review/text: As an adult who occasionally enjoys a cookie or two ... or six, I was hoping this new cookie would deliver a satisfying overload of chocolate and texture and become a household staple.  And while I was pleased with some aspects of this particular cookie, it did not meet the standards I was expecting.<br /><br />First of all, if one really wants something named "Chewy Gooey Megafudge" to actually taste good, they should skip the calorie counting because, in my opinion, taste has an inverse relationship with calories.  So, nutritional info aside, the overall taste for a mass-packaged soft cookie was quite satisfactory.  I liked the flavor of the chocolate cookie dough in combination with white-chocolate chips and the injected "fudge" and although the combination of the three sounds extremely rich, the cookies were not "heavy" or overly sweet.  The first cookie easily led to a second ... and then a third, so they did have an addictive quality to them (maybe now caloric intake should be considered).<br /><br />While flavor is important, I predicated my overall satisfaction on other aspects like texture, packaging, value, etc. and I had some issues with the Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies that generated disappointment:<br /><br />1) Texture - for soft cookies, they crumble too much.  It is frustrating to take a bite and have the remainder of the cookie falling apart around the fudge in the middle.  Additionally, the fudge was not gooey, as promised by the name ... it was more like cake icing.<br />2)  Packaging - for the size of the bag, there are relatively few cookies.  My first disappointment was opening the descent-sized bag of cookies only to find the plastic divider tray consuming most of the space ... and relatively few cookies.<br />3) Cookie Size - this was the biggest turn-off.  An addictive chocolate-chocolate chip cookie with fudge filling ... the size of a half-dollar?  C'mon, cookies like this need to be bigger than bite-sized.<br /><br />The lethal combination of tiny cookies and such small quantity (due to the packaging) was more than enough to negate the taste for me. In fact, I `m not sure a cookie-craving moment could be satisfied by a single bag!  Increasing the size of the cookie and putting more of them into the bag would make this product a staple in my household.

review/summary: Good, but Chocolate a Little Chalky/Off
review/text: These cookies were reviewed my myself and my 7, 5, and 3 year old kids. :)  Although we bake a lot at home, we also buy store bought cookies--including Chips Ahoy.  I'm not going to compare these to home baked, but to other store bought cookies.<br /><br />These are a good, chocolatey cookie--but the chocolate tastes a little off, which in my experience, is common when the main cookie is chocolate flavored.  They're filled with white and chocolate chips, and then have a chocolate middle.  The middle is not very liquidy--which is good.  I was afraid that it would make a mess, but it didn't.<br /><br />We all liked them--especially with a glass of cold milk.  The kids devoured them--so they're definitely a hit with the under 8 crowd.  I think if you were craving a true chocolate cookie (vs. a chocolate chip), this might fit the bill.  I just wish that the chocolate flavor was a bit better.  In general, I think Pepperidge Farms does better chocolate flavored cookies.  The chocolate on a Nabsico Oreo is also better tasting IMHO.<br /><br />Would buy again--but not destined to be a cravable favorite.

review/summary: Tasty, but a bit gritty and dry
review/text: I'm a big chocolate fan and was eager to try out these new cookies!  I was hoping to find something comparable to my all-time favorite packaged cookie: Grandma's Homestyle Fudge Chocolate chip cookies.<br /><br />The Chip's Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge is not nearly as good as Grandma's.  They cookies have a pleasant chocolate taste but the "gooey" part of the chocolate is actually a bit gritty.  The creaminess I expected wasn't there.  More importantly, these cookies are way too dry.  Even drinking a glass of water with them didn't help.  Grandma's cookies are very moist and with that as my benchmark, these cookies fell short.

review/summary: Not so gooey after all
review/text: These cookies are pretty average chocolate cookies.  The description of chewy and gooey megafudge doesn't really ring true.  The cookies are soft, and have a pleasant, not-too-sweet taste.  They have kind of an odd texture, almost like an oatmeal cookie.  All in all, I would say they are just ok.  Someone expecting decadent fudge taste will be disappointed.

review/text: Mmmm, chocolately goodness!  Not only are these Chips Ahoy cookies chewy and delicious, but they have creamy fudge inside!  They're quite delectable.  I'd buy more.  The only reason they lose a star is because they don't taste home-baked.  I know, store-bought cookies rarely do, but if they did, that'd make them perfect.<br /><br />Here's the health info: Serving size = 2 cookies. Calories per serving: 150. Calories from fat: 60.

review/text: These new cookies by the Nabisco/Chip Ahoy folks are pretty darn yummy.  Just as the description makes them sound, they are full of chocolate fudge gooeyness and goodness.  "Megafudge" may be a bit much though, as I was actually expecting the cookies to be slightly fudgier than they actually were.  Still, they tasted good, and made you want more.  Not sure if they are better than the standard Chips Ahoy (which I love), but they definitely fill a hunger gap when you need some chocolate fudge.  Worth a try!

review/summary: Chocolatey Goodness
review/text: As part of my participation in the Amazon Vines program, I received a box to review.  My family assisted with this review - quite eagerly in fact.<br /><br />If you love a really strong and rich chocolate cookie, then this is for you.  The ones we received were a bit on the crumbly side, but still delicious.<br /><br />I like lots of chocolate taste in my cookies, so I really enjoyed it.  Overall, I'd give it a 4 from my point of view.<br /><br />My wife liked them, but she felt the chocolate taste kind of overwhelmed it.  She thought it would make a good candidate to dip into a glass of milk or as something to crumble over a bowl of vanilla ice cream.  She said that she'd rate it between a 3 and a 3 and 1/2.<br /><br />Oldest daughter really liked it and ate one of youngest daughter's cookies which started a minor yelling match between the two.  She gives it a 5.<br /><br />Youngest daughter sums it up best.  She came into the kitchen and in her best almost 3 yr old demanding voice said, "I want more cookie!"<br /><br />Add it all up and it's a definite four.

review/summary: Crumbly and way too sweet
review/text: "Chewy" and "gooey" don't describe the cookies I received.  They were crumbly and falling apart, and while there was some chocolate flavor, it was overwhelmed with sugar and left a too-sweet aftertaste.  Three stars are an average of one star (from me) and five stars (from my kids).  Ok for the kids' lunch box, I guess, but I'm sticking with the Oreo brand - the mint fudge ones were awesome.

review/summary: Cookies!
review/text: Cookies can be put into three basic buckets (or maybe cookie jars).  There are your homemade cookies, which if you know any semi-decent cooks, are the source of the best cookies.  Then there are the bakery cookies and the store-bought (which is to say, processed and pre-packaged) cookies.  It wouldn't be fair to compare across these buckets as they have different standards, any more than it'd be fair to compare a low-budget horror movie to Citizen Kane.<br /><br />So how do the Chips Ahoy Chewey Gooey Megafudge cookies hold up against the competition in the cookie aisle.  Reasonably well.  Obviously, taste is a subjective thing, particularly with foods.  I can explain why I think a particular movie or book is good or bad, but for cookies, it's more difficult.  I liked them, the co-workers I shared them with liked them, and I went back for more than one.  But I've also had better; if I were buying cookies, these would not be my first choice, but I wouldn't refuse them either.  If you like Chips Ahoy cookies and you like chocolate, these will be a decent selection.

review/summary: Could use more fudge...but yum!
review/text: I am a chocoholic and these have a very nice, chocolatey taste. However, the layer of fudge in the center was a bit skimpy. Not exactly megafudge in my opinion...just fudge. Also, they are extremely crumbly; it was hard to even get them out of the package without breaking. Luckily, they are pretty freaking delicious, which makes up for the skimpy fudge and the crumbs. It was hard to limit myself to one serving, which is 2 cookies and comes in at 150 calories.

review/summary: not really that gooey
review/text: For a 'gooey' cookie, I was expecting something, well, a bit more gooier and a stronger fudge taste.  These cookies had a decent chocolate taste and didn't lack for chocolate chips, but while they were soft they didn't really leave that much of a gooey impression (not to go overboard on the word, here, even if it's what's blazoned on the package).  If anything, they leave a bit of a dry mouth and call out for a glass of milk while munching on them, along with a bit of a sugary aftertaste (I had to double-check to see if there was any artificial sweeteners in the ingredients and didn't see any jump out from the list).<br /><br />So all in all, not a bad cookie if you're looking for something soft and chocolately to satisfy a chocolate craving, but a bit disappointing if you're hoping for something more along the lines of fudgey and moist.

review/summary: Chocolatey flavor, but too soft and not enough fudge
review/text: I have always been a fan of the original Chips Ahoy! cookies and since I love chocolate, I had to try these. Unfortunately, I didn't care for them that much. The overall flavor is very chocolatey, however that's the best thing I can say about them. There is so little fudge in the center of the cookie, you barely can see it, let alone taste it. Since they're called "Megafudge", I expect a lot more fudgey-filling. The chips are quite small and don't add much to the cookie. My biggest complaint is that they're too soft. Many (very many) of the cookies in my package were partially or completely broken and crumbly because they're that soft. The cookies are also on the small side, yet they're 150 calories for only two. If they were bigger, didn't crumble so much and had a lot more fudge inside, I would have enjoyed these much more. But as they are, I won't get them again.

review/summary: Lots of chocolate flavor in a small cookie.
review/text: Basically I liked these cookies ok, but they're not my favorites. They were adequate. I don't think I'd turn one down if someone offered it to me, but I doubt that I'd choose them in the grocery store. You do get a lot of chocolate taste per cookie, although it was kind of cloyingly sweet overall.<br /><br />I was hoping the gooey fudge middle would add something special to the cookie-eating experience but it didn't really seem to do much for me. It was hard to even notice that it was there. The cookies are very small, with a crumbly, even, dry, texture. There are some white chocolate chips sprinkled throughout but I couldn't really taste them.<br /><br />The best feature of these cookies was that they are very chocolatey and killed my chocolate craving immediately after having just one - I put the package away. The worst thing was the dryness. Overall my impression is one of mediocrity. Not bad, not good. Not sure I'll be buying these in the future...

And they're SMALL cookies to boot. I am sure my kids will be happy to polish these off for me, but they just didn't do it for this chocolate fan.

review/summary: Soft Gooey Decadence...
review/text: I have always been partial to soft chocolate cookies.  They're not only delicious, but we also get to be lazy while eating them for they just melt in your mouth.  These Chips Ahoy chewy gooey's, (CGs) are just about as soft and gooey and chocolaty as it can get in a mass produced, store brand cookie.  As far as their taste, I have to agree with the other reviewer here that compared them to the big Grandma brand chocolate cookies in both softness and flavor. (But not in the amount of chocolate chips, the CGS are a little more generous with them in that department).  If you happen to know or like those,  you will definitely love these smaller variations on the same theme.  They are just a shade above what one would call bite size, but still small enough to swallow whole by most true cookie lovers. As for their calories and nutrition, I'm afraid when I decide that I have a hankerin' for chocolate cookies, I reach for the sky.  I don't eat them everyday to be sure, so I make my moments in time with them everything they can be.  If you're at all health conscious when it comes to cookies, I suggest you pass these up and eat something healthier, that no doubt will meet the average cookie criteria of healthier, (more expensive with less flavor).  For the true cookie monster in your family, pick up some of these Gooey's on occasion, or order them in bulk here on Amazon. Trust me you will get rewarded with all kinds of big smiles for it...

Upon opening the package in my receiving room, there was only one cookie left for me to bring to my apartment after the staff tasted them!  They are reminiscent of Pepperidge Farm soft chewy cookies but are more crumbly so they are best not eaten in a carpeted room.  I definitely will purchase them again.

However, I had heard good things about these and my son was very anxious to try them out.<br /><br />They are definitely chewy, gooey and fudgy. The taste is ok, but I thought there were a little too soft. The calorie count (210 calories for 3 small cookies) won't work for my diet.<br /><br />However, as an occasional treat for my teen age son, they are definite hit. He had seen all the hype on TV and was anxious to taste them. He loved the texture and the level of chocolatieness. (sp?) As he's a rather picky eater, even with sweets, this was high praise.

review/summary: Just OK if your expectations are low
review/text: At my house, I am known as the Cookie Monster. I love cookies and bake cookies, too. Chips Ahoy! (original) are one of my favorites.<br /><br />However, these are quite disappointing. The packaging size and pictures are very misleading. The cookies themselves are scarcely bigger than those "toy" cookies you get at McDonald's. See my customer images.<br /><br />As far as chewy and gooey, I would call them more like soggy. The "fudge" was a not-too-sweet and not-too-flavorful layer of filling in the middle which simply tears apart. See my customer image. They seem to be rather crumbly and mostly held together by their oiliness.  Compared to the Chocofudge variety, this Megafudge looks better but really doesn't taste any better.  In fact, I'd give a slight edge to the Chocofudge.<br /><br />Finally, a serving size is a laughable 2 cookies. These are so tiny, I easily ate four of them which is two servings at 150 calories an 7 grams of fat each serving. For a rather unsatisfying 300 calories and 22% of the USRDA of fat intake, I could definitely do better.<br /><br />I hope you found my review and customer images useful.

review/summary: surprisingly tastastic
review/text: I grew up eating the normal Chips Ahoy! Chocolate Chip cookies. The eighties were a time where we didn't care whether or not something was locally source, or variety (sans Pepsi Clear) as we were more concerned about the various battles different robots (Transformers, Voltron, and sadly, the Gobots) were involved in across the universe.<br /><br />Enter Chewy Gooey Megafudge.<br /><br />Is it a fudge brownie? no.<br />Is it a chocolate chip cookie? not exactly.<br /><br />To be honest, these cookies DID taste like brownies to me, but they had a strange crunchiness that I really kind of enjoyed (the crunchiness seemed to be scattered throughout its gooeyness). I read through the ingredients and noticed that these cookies are actually made with sugar (as opposed to high fructose corn syrup). There's always the chance that Palm Oil might scare you away (or it might attract you, depending on which side of the issue you stand).<br /><br />There is no denying that these cookies are very tasty. With or without milk. The texture is generally soft (apart from the crunchy bits I mentioned) and there is a substantial chocolate kick. The cookies are about the diameter of a medium sized Roma tomato (maybe 2 inches?) and the white chocolate is kind of hard to see. Additionally, my cookies were kind of square. This might be the result of heat, or shipping, or heat and shipping via the UPS delivery mode. If you have any questions, feel free to comment. If there was something you thought would have made this review better, comment as well - I'm pretty responsive (even to the negative stuff).

review/text: For some reason I was expecting these cookies to be larger, more like the Grandma's brand size, but they were the same size as a standard crisp Chips Ahoy! cookie.<br /><br />The cookies were soft, and definitely gooey with the filling inside. I would say that, for my tastes, there was too much filling and too little cookie. I really like the texture of most soft cookies, but this one was a little too gooey for me. I would say the filling was more like chocolate frosting in consistency and less like fudge.<br /><br />The taste was very chocolatey, so if you're a big chocolate fan you might like these. There were small white chips sprinkled throughout, presumable white chocolate chips? but I couldn't taste them.<br /><br />I like the re-sealable package, I don't buy cookies much so I don't know if this is standard for Chips Ahoy! cookies now, but it's very convenient.<br /><br />Overall I would say that the taste of these cookies was good, but the texture was a little too chewy, with too much filling.

When I pulled them out and ate them cold they were really great. I have a HUGE sweet tooth and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that these cookies were enough to satisfy it. My only complaint is that I expected the fudge in the center of the cookies to be more liquidy because of the packaging which says 'chewy gooey' but they were still delicious and I would purchase them again. I received both this flavor and the Chocofudge. They were both great, but I prefer the chocofudge better.

review/summary: Pleasant enough, but Neither Chewy or Gooey
review/text: Finding softness in a major brand supermarket cookie is usually a problem, so I was excited by the name of these cookies, hoping they would live up to their title and the picture on the package.<br /><br />While soft, they are not gooey or chewy. In fact, they are too soft, so one third of the cookies in my package were broken, some literally in crumbs. The fudge filling may contribute to their fragility.<br /><br />The fudge filling is not soft and gooey, but is more like the consistency of the filling in sandwich cookies. It adds an additional punch of chocolate flavor, but does not contribute to what little texture these cookies have.<br /><br />Throughout the cookies are apparently white chocolate chips, but they have no taste (even when sampled on their own). No white chocolate taste, not even sugar, just white bits of stuff that add some mild crunch.<br /><br />The flavor of the cookies is nice but is more like the "fresh-baked" cookies you might find in a grocery store than any home-made cookies. There is no discernible butter flavor and the chocolate flavor is mild in spite of the cookie's dark color.<br /><br />These cookies would be OK in a cookie jar, are too fragile for a packed lunch, and are small. All in all, they might be fine for occasional snacks, but don't look for a great experience.

review/summary: Very moist, but too sweet for me!
review/text: These arrived today and the timing could not have been better as I was craving something sweet. First impression was they were very moist, but the sweetness was overpowering and cloyingly so.  It reminds of the diet products from the eighties that used apple juice as a sweetener.  I took a peek at the ingredients and after sugar it lists something called "invert sugar".  If you like moist and super chocolaty sweetness, this may appeal to you.  For me, I will pass on these at the grocery store.

review/summary: Terrible!
review/text: When I first bit into the cookie, I felt it was "soggy". While the cookies were supposed to be gooey, they come across as soggy and stale. For a cookie named "Megafudge" these cookies did not have a strong chocolate flavor. The cookies tasted more fruity than chocolaty. They almost reminded me of the center part of a fig newton.<br /><br />I am surprised that a product this awful could make it to market. They are perhaps the worst store bought cookies I have tried to date.

review/summary: A good little cookie...
review/text: ...emphasis on the little. If you're watching your weight, don't pick these up to help you. 150 calories for 2 cookies is quite a bit. But, I thought the fudge center tasted pretty good, the white chips (white chocolate?) were not easily identified by sight nor taste. The problem I had was one of texture; the cookie itself is very dry, and the gooey center was like thick goop - not 'gooey' unless you decide to stick it in the microwave (or in the hot sun). A so-so product.

review/text: I have never been a fan of Chips Ahoy cookies, there is something about them that tastes artificial to me. But these Chewy Gooey cookies change that for me! They are just what they say they are, nice and soft and chewy with just the right amount of chocolate fudge inside. I love the white chocolate chips in them as well, they add a nice crunch to the otherwise soft cookie. These remind me of cookies you can find in a popular store located in most malls. I will be buying these cookies again!

review/summary: On the edge...
review/text: These cookies are about 2 inches in diameter, which was smaller than I expected. They don't seem very chewy to me, more of a soft texture a bit chalky.<br /><br />There is a little bit of gooey in the middle, at first I thought the gooey was from melting in mail being delivered on the hottest day of the year so far but they actually withstand the temperature pretty well. I put them in the fridge as soon as I got them out of the mail since the packaging was hot but they didn't melt or change consistency.<br /><br />My boyfriend who loves anything cookie, actually didn't like these so much. He said they tasted like they weren't all the way cooked through, that might be the gooey middle giving him that impression.<br /><br />There are some white chips in the cookies, I am assuming they are white chocolate chips? They are kind of crunchy and I thought at first the cookie might have walnuts in it, but right now it is a mystery chip to me. The cookie is very sweet in my opinion. It lives up to it megafudge name with the sweetness and the gooey middle.<br /><br />I haven't made up my mind if I like this cookie or not. I kind of like the flavor but it is on the sweet side and I am iffy about the texture since it is not chewy as described in the title.

review/summary: A not-so-special indulgence
review/text: I was somewhat disappointed with these cookies. The packaging proclaims that they're "Chewy Gooey" and describes them as "fudge filled soft cookies." Well, they're definitely soft and they're certainly cookies, but calling them "fudge filled" is a bit of a stretch. There's a microscopic amount of "fudge" in the middle of each cookie, and their texture is noticeably dry. The taste is just all right--these cookies are nothing special, really, and at 150 calories (and 18% of the RDA of saturated fat) for each 2-cookie serving, there are a lot tastier snacks available on the market. You might be curious to try these for yourself, but I doubt these will become a regular presence in your cupboard.

review/summary: Interesting... but Better?
review/text: I am actually torn about these cookies. There is a lot I like, and a few thigns I am not sure about. I mean, I don't require things to be especially natural when it comes to products like these, but I can't help but feel this gooey stuff in the middle is more than a little artificial tasting. This is beyond cremes in twinkies, cupcakes and stacked between oreos. The taste is not entirely pleasant, but I like the cookie. I also like the size of these cookies, small like the chips ahoy and really chewy. I am going to freeze the cookies a bit and see if the goo warms up to me when it's colder. If you're into something that tastes more natural, definitely stay away. For those folks, try the Fig Newton Thins instead.

review/summary: Good, but not exactly great.
review/text: I'm not exactly a cookie connoisseur, but I love trying new types that are out on the market & I absolutely love soft cookies. I'd assumed from the "chewy gooey" part that the cookies would be soft, which was correct. I also assumed that anything with the word "megafudge" in it would also be pretty awesome. I was only partially right.<br /><br />Where the cookie goes right is that it's a very soft cookie. I don't think a hard cookie would really be all that great for something with fudge in the middle.<br /><br />Where the cookie goes wrong is that it's not particularly gooey as far as fudge goes. A thin layer of icing in a cookie does not automatically equate with gooey or fudge. The texture of this is also an issue. I shared some of these with a few of my coworkers & almost all of them mentioned that it was a strange texture, even the ones who adored the taste.<br /><br />Taste-wise this is ok. It's not a bad flavor, but it's not particularly great either. It's very rich & I wasn't really able to distinguish between any of the flavors (white chocolate, fudge, & chocolate). I hate to say it, but I've had better "mega" cookies.<br /><br />If you're looking for something ultra-decadent then you'll only partially find it here. I just don't think it's worth the guilt trip that I got later after eating them. The resealable packaging was nice but if you want some really rich & soft cookies, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TFSM92">Oreo Cakesters</a>.<br /><br />I liked these fine enough but I don't think I'll be buying any on my own accord.<br /><br />2.5/5

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I love chocolate cookies, but these are sorely lacking.<br /><br />Like many mass-produced soft cookies, these have an artificial, chemical taste to them. The package shows a gooey fudge center (as in the name, Chewy Gooey Megafudge) but the fudge-like center is quite solid, not soft and gooey. The texture of the cookie is fine, but the chocolate bits and fudge center are more granular than smooth and creamy.<br /><br />The packaging is great. I love the resealable packaging and found that it opened easily and sealed well.<br /><br />Although I would buy regular Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies, I would not buy these again.

review/summary: Not Worth 75 Calories
review/text: I like soft and hard cookies and would rather eat dessert than most other foods.  This cookie is soft and gooey, but the chocolate or fudge lacks quality and is mixed with all sorts of chemicals and artificial flavors.  It tastes like a store bought cookie that could not compete with a Pinwheel or Mrs. Fields packaged chocolate chip.  You can consume 70 calories wisely with Dove Miniature ice cream pieces made with ice cream and covered with wonderful dark chocolate.  One serving of Gooey Chips Ahoy is two cookies at 150 calories.<br /><br />The innovation appeared in the packaging.  There is a resealable lift on the top of the "box" which keeps the cookies fresher and it avoids breaking open the whole box to get one cookie.  Other than that, I was disappointed.  This is not your grandma's cookie recipe.

review/summary: High Calorie Granulated Cookie with Mushy Bits
review/text: Granted, I don't normally buy cookies, except at coffee houses, and those are cookies made locally by high-end bakeries that use organic and fresh ingredients.<br /><br />So, this Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge tempted me as something different, and honestly, I wanted to see what I might be missing.<br /><br />I was sadly disappointed. The Goo in these cookies are little bits of chocolate fudge and white chocolate.  The surrounding cookie does not have much substance and has a granular feel, not at all like I would expect from Chips Ahoy!<br /><br />In case you are interested, here is the nutritional information:<br /><br />2 cookies (31g), about 9 servings per package:<br />150 Calories, 60 from fat, 7g fat, 3.5 Saturated, 0 Cholesterol, 110 mg Sodium, 80 mg Ptassium, 21g Carbs, Less than 1g of Fiber (horrors!), 13g Sugars, 1g Protein, 8% Iron.<br /><br />At least they could have thrown in some vitamins and fiber.<br /><br />As it is I am going to toss these cookies and mark the yuck factor up to experience.

review/summary: Not exactly gooey, but definitely good!
review/text: It's over 100-degrees outside right now, and the poor mail lady has an open cab--no air conditioning.  So when she delivered these cookies from Amazon, I expected "gooey" to be taken to new levels, maybe gloopy or just completely melted.  But they were still perfectly intact.  And were not actually gooey at all.  You know how chocolate chips, once they are cooked and have cooled again, are not hard like uncooked chocolate, and are not gooey like freshly melted chocolate, but are actually slightly grainy like a brownie or something?  Well that is the texture of the chocolate in these cookies.<br /><br />What I do love about these cookies is the very chocolatiness.  The whole cookie is like a brownie.  Not fudge.  Fudge is milky and gooey.  These are brownie cookies; not milk chocolate, not gooey, but very very chocolatey.  I personally dislike milk chocolate.  I do love dark chocolate.  That could be why I like these cookies so well.<br /><br />They don't taste like fresh-baked cookies.  They are soft and moist, which is good, but they do taste packaged and preserved.  I guess that's not so shocking considering that they are actually packaged and preserved.  The cookies are small... I don't see a problem with that... as they are soft cookies; their size keeps them from crumbling under their own weight.<br /><br />This is a cookie for brownie lovers and dark chocolate lovers.

review/summary: small and alright
review/text: I thought they were alright, a nice fudgey flavor with caramel too, but my eight year old said they tasted like "nothing" to him and he didn't want anymore.  I hope to attach some pictures because when you think Chips Ahoy you think of a certain size cookie and these things are only slightly larger than an oreo.  The packaging is the same size as regular Chips Ahoy but there is alot of fill in the package.  The serving size is two cookies, and like I said they are small!  I got these for free through Vine but we won't be spending our money to buy more.  I am giving them only three stars based upon my son's reaction (after all I try not to eat cookies that often),the fact they are so small, and lastly because they break so easily just trying to remove them from the packaging.  I also let my sister taste them and she was not impressed...her exact words being "not worth the calories," and this from a junk food junkie!

review/summary: Chocoholics would be interested in these
review/text: I was excited to try the new Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies so of course when they came up for review I picked them immediately.  I LOVE Chips Ahoy! Cookies in the blue package and chocolate so of course I figured these would be AMAZING!<br /><br />There weren't a lot in the package and my first impression of them was that they smelled like brownies . . . they smelled good!  The cookies were full of chocolate, as the name implies, but they weren't really gooey.  I think of gooey cookies as the ones that are slightly undercooked when you pull them from the oven.  They are slightly warm - and of course these couldn't be since they came packaged - and they melt in your mouth!  These seemed to break apart easily as the texture seemed to be slightly dry.  I suppose I could have tried warming them in the microwave to see if that altered the cookie some, but I didn't think of that.  They were not hard and crumbly, but not really moist either.  In the center was a chocolate concoction that wasn't really gooey and of course chocolate and white chocolate chips throughout the outside of the cookie.  These combined with a chocolate cookie dough all added up to give this cookie quite a chocolate punch.  The cookies are definitely a chocoholic's dream cookie!  I did not feel that they left a bad taste in your mouth either like the other versions do.  But I found they were too rich and full of chocolate for me.  Sometimes you shouldn't mess with a good thing.  However, that being said if you are a chocoholic with a serious sweet tooth and you don't have time for homemade, warm from the oven cookies then these will do for you!  For me, I think I will stick with the tried and true homemade, and for emergencies the good old standby in the blue package - Chips Ahoy!

review/text: I received these just today in the mail.  They had been sitting on my porch for an indeterminate amount of time.  I was pleased to see the easy open packaging that Nabisco has been using on their cookies.  When I opened it, all the cookies were intact and smelled very chocolately!  The cookies ended up being slightly warm from sitting outside, but I think that made them even better.  They tasted like fresh out of the oven cookies.  I broke one in half to examine the gooey inside.  It was, indeed, gooey and filled with chocolate.  If you aren't a big chocolate fan, you may want to try the original version, which I have also had.  Me, being a big chocoholic, thought that these cookies were great.  The white chips didnt have much flavor.  I think they were overwhelmed by the chocolate.  I would recommend maybe microwaving the cookie for a few seconds to get a nice warm center.

review/summary: More of a crumbly brownie than cookie
review/text: These seem to need to be handled with some care - when my package arrived, about half the cookies were broken and tumbled around inside the package despite the air packs around them.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are very dense and a little crumbly.  The inside isn't gooey at all, it's more of a thin layer of chocolate that reminded me a bit of the inside of an under-cooked brownie.  The taste is similar to one and doesn't have any crunch to it, just a thick chocolate texture.  One the plus side, you'll only need to eat one or two of these to satisfy your need for chocolate so the pack should last a while even though there are only about 20 cookies in it at 75 calories each.

Most of the cookies were not broken though.<br /><br /> The taste is great and maked you want to have a nice cold glass of milk with them. You couldn't ask for more kind of chocolate in them. They are chewy if you eat them at room temperature.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed in the size because 2 cookies give you 150 calories. They would be good to serve at a party along with some lower calorie snack. Not good to eat too many if you are trying to lose weight since they pack 13 grams of sugar!<br /><br />So, in summary, they are good once in a while.

review/text: I wanted to try these cookies because of the fudgey center.  I think these cookies are too soft, as the center kind of blends into the cookie, which is too soft. Some of the cookies were stuck together, or they break when you lift them out of the package.  The chocolate, both the cookie and the center tastes kind of fake to me.<br /><br />I think these cookies could be better if they weren't so soft, so the center would be more prevalent, and have a more real chocolate taste.  I also think they would be better if they were alittle larger, so that the cookie stands out from the center.

It is a chocolate cookie with chocolate chips and white chocolate chips and then in the middle is fudge. No unlike the packaging the fudge in the middle was not very "gooey". It was a little chewy but nothing like the picture on the packaging would lead you to believe. Also I did not find the cookies to be as chewy as the normal Chewy Chips Ahoy! cookies. They are good cookies, a little too chocolaty for my taste, but I know that for you chocoholics out there, these new cookies will be right up your alley.

review/summary: For Chocolate Lovers
review/text: This soft, gooey cousin to Chips Ahoy's crisp chocolate chip cookie, has much to offer for the chocolate lover. The almost-like homemade taste and softness gives the cookies a freshness not found in other similar cookies. In addition to white and dark chocolate pieces inside the cookie, is a delicious fudgey center. A chocolate cookie, with dark and white chocolate pieces, and a fudge center! Can it get any better?<br /><br />Whereas one cookie, most often isn't enough, these cookies are so rich that one cookie is plenty for an after-lunch, after-dinner, or anytime snack. The soft, chocolately, fudgey goodness goes great with a glass of cold milk or a bowl of vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />The package is also resealable, so that you don't have to finish all the cookies in one sitting. If you like chocolate and/or fudge, you'll be a big fan of Chips Ahoy's Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.

review/text: I've tried both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49QU2">Megafudge</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U43ZO0">Chocofudge</a> versions of these cookies, and I'm writing a similar review for both.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the taste of these cookies.  The center chocolate fudge (which is soft enough to bite through easily, but not actually gooey) is quite tasty and the highlight of the cookie to me.  Chips Ahoy did a good job on that part.  The cakey portion of the cookies taste pretty good to me, too, but the texture isn't great.  They are kind of dry and just crumble apart.  So, not hard and crunchy, nor moist and soft.  More like dry and soft.  If you're like me, you're definitely going to want something to drink afterwards.<br /><br />I've tried the cookies at room temperature, warmed up in the microwave, and chilled in the refrigerator.  I like them chilled the best because the cookies didn't crumble apart in my mouth like they did otherwise.  Warmed up in the microwave, it wasn't much softer than room temperature...just harder to eat with some parts being uncomfortably hot.  Perhaps warmed in the oven would be better, but I haven't been inspired enough to heat up Chips Ahoy cookies in the oven, yet.  :)<br /><br />These things are bite sized and have 75 calories and 3.5g of fat each.  Not horrible for a cookie, for sure, but the taste isn't good enough to get me to pick these over something else.<br /><br />Given that the chocolate "fudge" is the main attraction to me, I liked the Megafudge version with the chocolate exterior better than the Chocofudge version because the chocolate flavor was much stronger.  Both are around 3.5 stars to me, but with the edge to Megafudge, I gave them a 4 and the Chocofudge a 3 here on Amazon.<br /><br />I'd definitely suggest getting a single bag at the local store to try these out before buying in bulk.  You might love these, but four bags is a whole lot of cookies if you don't.  ;)

review/summary: The packaging was a dud...
review/text: Chips Ahoy chewy cookies- yum!  Or so I thought.  I felt the cookies were meh.  Just ok.  Nothing to sing home about, not super fudgey, just mediocre.  They were just something I ate mindlessly and really could care less about<br /><br />I think the biggest pitfall for me to ding this product was the packaging, there's a pull top so you can open the cookies from the top (think of baby wipes, not the push lid but the refills where you pull off the top to open them and it's sticky) instead of having to open at the end and slide the cookie tray out.  Good idea, right?<br /><br />Idea and effort get an A.  The execution, not so much.  It would have been awesome had the package been resealable (mine was not, maybe faulty packaging? Who knows).  Other than that, good idea.  The cookies were just ok.  Not sure I would buy them in the store, that's just me though...

review/summary: Over-processed And Meh Tasting
review/text: I like to take cookies in my lunch, and I decided to give these a try since I love chocolate.  However I found these to be rather so so.  After looking at the ingredients I think I know why.  Three of them are in the over-processed or artificial category - enriched wheat flour, invert sugar, and artificial flavors.  The last is the worst to me because it screams that the taste of our product doesn't stand on its own.  While these cookies aren't "spit it out" bad, the taste is just off.  If you want a better tasting chocolate cookie give the Bear Naked Double Chocolate Soft Baked Granola Cookies a try instead.  I think you will be more pleased with the product, and the ingredients that make it up.

review/summary: Rich and delicious
review/text: I am a huge lover of chocolate and just hearing the word "megafudge" makes me drool.  I was very excited to try out these cookies from Chips Ahoy.  At first, even though I am a chocoholic, I was worried that these may be a bit overly chocolately.  However, after taking my first bite, I was in chocolate bliss.  The soft outer cookie and ooey gooey inner flow of chocolate was the perfect combination.  Normally I am not a fan of white chocolate, however these little white chocolate bits were not overly sweet and basically created a bit of a crunch, rather than that overly sweet flavor that is so common with white chocolate.  The different textures of gooey chocolate with soft outer shell and slight crunch all work together wonderfully.<br /><br />Yes, these cookies are sweet and rich.  One or two will be the perfect cure for any chocolate craving that you may have.  As a cookie and chocolate lover, these were perfect.  Between my two kids and I, the bag was gone in a couple of days.  These are also perfect with a cup of coffee as an afternoon treat/pick-me-up.<br /><br />I will definitely be purchasing these several times in the future and look forward to trying the Chips Ahoy! Chocofudge variety as well!

review/summary: Fudge Explosion
review/text: The Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are incredibly rich and chocolaty.  They remind me of Subway's double chocolate chip cookies, which are my favorites - except these go an extra step and have a gooey chocolate center. The centers aren't as creamy as the packaging or commercial would lead you to believe. But these are now one of my top picks for cookies. Delicious. Decadent. These will satisfy the most demanding of sweet tooth's.

review/summary: Moist, rich and delicious but very high in calories
review/text: I have always liked Chips Ahoy cookies but these are totally different than the normal ones. These are very moist and super rich. They really remind me more of brownie than a cookie but they are very delicious. They are very dark chocolate inside and out and they have a thin layer of fudge in the middle. The down side is the number of calories in each cookie. 75 calories per cookie is a little high in my opinion but since they are so rich you really don't need to eat more than two of them at a time.

review/summary: Homemade Are Better
review/text: I know some would say that "homemade are better" is a no-brainer, but I happen to think that some store bought cookies are just fabulous!  However, these are not in that category.  They were dry - far from being gooey - and quite tasteless.  They are also really small so it was not like you could lay them out on a plate and serve, they are more of a pop-in-the-mouth snack.  I personally would not get these again.<br /><br />This review is through the Vine Program.

review/summary: Good, but smaller than they look
review/text: I really like the taste of these, and the kids like them, too.  I was surprised to see how small the actual cookies are - they seem smaller than regular chips ahoy - about the diameter of a 50-cent piece.<br /><br />The fudge in the center really isn't all that gooey - breaking a cookie open, it won't look like the picture.  Maybe if you heated it in the microwave it would.<br /><br />They are very soft, which I liked.<br />About 18 cookies per package - they'll go quick b/c they're so small.<br />I'd rather get them from the store - shipping them they get all jumbled up and crumby.

review/summary: Not A Cookie Cutter Cookie
review/text: One of the best things about these strange little cookies is that they're irregularly shaped so your guests will believe you when you lie and say you made them. They're not common cookie cutter cookies. Somehow they almost seem friendly.<br /><br />Another notable thing is the slick resealable packaging. It had to be designed by a genius. When you pull the top of the package where it says "lift," it slides back almost zipper-like to reveal the cookies and allows enough finger room to extract 4-5 of them at a time. (This is good if you're hungry, in hurry or sneaking cookies.) The top then glides back in place and seals the cookies completely so no air can get in. An engineering marvel!<br /><br />You may ask why the world needs another chocolate cookie. I don't know. I do know that people who eat chocolate cookies are known to be nice people. The world needs more of them. The world would be a friendlier place if more people had chocolate cookie crumbs clinging to their chins.<br /><br />The chocolate flavor in these cookies is more subtle than overpowering and isn't sickeningly sweet. Two or three cookies can satisfy a moderate chocolate craving, and four to six, a serious addiction. And you don't need teeth. These cookies are soft enough to gum your way to ecstasy.<br /><br />Try these cookies for the packaging alone. You can spend an enjoyable afternoon just unzipping and rezipping the top. Be honest. You could find a worse way to spend your time.

review/text: It's not even about being a cookie snob. It's that these taste no different from my 30-year old memory of eating Chips Ahoy as a kid, so what has been done in the interim to make them better or more delicious? Nothing. They are waxy, falsely chocolate flavored and not worth the caloric bother, not even for the price.

review/summary: Nice and Chocolaty!
review/text: And that's because this cookie contains two types of chips:  white and chocolate.  It's nice and soft and practically melts in your mouth.  The size is nice, not too large and not too small, and the packaging is innovative:  You pull a strip and pull back the top covering - then it is resealable so the cookies stay fresh.<br /><br />I've put mine in the far pantry so as not to be tempted to overindulge.  It's working so far.<br /><br />These cookies are a Kraft Global product, so one expects a quality product.  To me, they do not disappoint!  In fact, I'd like to try other types of their cookies.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: These are pretty delicious for a packaged cookie!<br /><br />I wouldn't exactly call it "gooey."  The fudge inside isn't going to melt out of the cookie and the cookie doesn't leave chocolate reside on your hands.  Its more like a 3/4 baked brownie.  Delicious, soft with some semi-solid center.<br /><br />I also like they the cookies are fairly small.  I'd like to think that this will lead me to eat less of them but it is probably more likely I'll just have two instead of one.<br /><br />I received this product free and, honestly, I don't buy many prepackaged cookies (I prefer to make my own) but, when I do need a quick fix, I'll probably choose these in the future.

review/text: Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are the company's newest creation. The cookie is a cross between a homemade version and store-bought with a flavorful gooey fudge center. Peppered throughout the cookies are morsels of chocolate chips. While the overall concept seems like a winner, the cookies leave a chalky taste in your mouth. I was hoping to be wowed by this delicious new treat; however, the product did not live up to my high expectations.

Although their cookies are a little crunchy, with milk they're absolutely delicious.<br /><br />Their new cookies are even better. These are a soft chewy chocolate cookie with a gooey center that's also made of chocolate. You can get these either in fudge or dark chocolate.<br /><br />I tried the fudge, and I like these better than the original cookies now. In fact, if you're looking for a sweet snack that is satisfying, 2 of these cookies and an 8 oz glass of milk are perfect.<br /><br />These cookies are really sweet, and the chocolate center of the cookie is really melt in your mouth. That was the part I liked best: the chocolate middle. It just feels so good on your tongue, and it tastes even better, really smooth.<br /><br />If you're a chocolate lover who is looking for a sweet treat that will quickly satisfy you, this is it.

review/text: I had hoped that these cookies would be a nice, new take on the classic Chips Ahoy. My family didn't like them and we threw out the package.<br /><br />The collective family opinion:<br /><br />- fake tasting - not like real chocolate<br />- soft, but not moist<br />- not gooey in the middle<br />- did not smell good, smelled fake<br /><br />Nabisco used unbleached flour which is better than enriched bleached flour, and I applaud Nabisco for making that move. They also added a generous amount of white chocolate chips, but these didn't help the end product. We will likely try new Chips Ahoy products but won't be buying these.

On second thought, there isn't too much chocolate flavor, rather, the cookies are just too sweet to taste anything. Additionally the cookies are gooey to the point of falling apart.

review/text: My son says give this a "10 out of 10".  I first tried these a few days ago and although they are crumbly and fall apart easily, they are soft and delicious enough to make it worth it.  My son had his first today and since he is more of a cookie connoisseur than I am, I am going with his rating.  He likes that they are "soft, but not gooey".  So although I just realized that the description Chips Ahoy gave them is Chewy Gooey, I guess its not the "gooey in a bad way".<br /><br />The packaging is good and includes a resealable flap to allow us to enjoy some immediately and some later.

review/summary: Totally Shocked
review/text: Honestly, I thought this would be an easy four or five star rating. How can you go wrong with chocolate chip cookies? Obviously, there are a couple of ways. One major complaint is in the packaging. I opened the container up and was met with a crumbly mess. This is partly due to the texture of the cookies. Most were broken, but there were about five still intact. One bite and the cookie crumbled into pieces.<br /><br />Another problem was the cookie was dry and there wasn't a chewy gooey feel to the chocofudge. If you can block out the dryness, there's a powerful chocolate flavor that is sweet. It could totally satisfy a chocolate craving.<br /><br />The bottom line is unless major improvements are done, I wouldn't purchase these even on sale. I also wouldn't recommend them.

review/text: I am a big fan of chocolate and chocolate chip cookies, so I am somewhat partial to these gooey cookies. They are filled with chocolate fudge, which makes them noticeably sweeter than most other chocolate chip cookies. They are certainly very gooey, but they are not at all chewy. They are also much smaller than most other Chips Ahoy! chocolate chip cookies. They are very crumbly, and I am even tempted to leave them in the fridge to stiffen up. Like most other Chips Ahoy! packagings, the box has an easy resalable cover which will help keep the cookies fresh for as long as they last. Overall, these are good chocolate-chips cookies that add a new twist to this kind of sweets.

It also has a grainy, almost crunchy texture that while not offensive, does leave me a little confused.<br /><br />Megafudge Chips Ahoy! are decent cookies, but there is nothing special here that would entice me to buy these instead of store-bought chewy chocolate chip cookies.

review/summary: Passable Factory Fudge-a-Cookie
review/text: Nabisco describes these as "fudge filled soft cookies" [sic], and that's basically what you get.  And yes, they are kosher.<br /><br />The Package<br /><br />You get about 18 cookies in the package, inside the standard flat tray of 3 rows (the plastic is recyclable!).  The package opens with a security strip-equipped and resealable flap on the top.  All cookies inside were moist and chewy when the package was opened.<br /><br />I don't know if this was a result of these cookies being mailed, but when I opened the package, two of the rows of cookies had stuck completely together, so I got two reeeeeally thick cookies.  It looks like if the cookies are stored with the tray horizontally, then they're fine, but if the package is turned on either side, their respective moistness, which is a big part of the product's allure, makes them glom together.  Prying them apart led to some cookie disintegration.<br /><br />The packaging tells me these cookies are "chewy gooey."  I fully concur on the chewy part.  Not nearly as chewy as, say, an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006136E0">Archway cookie</a>, but sufficiently soft and chewy.  But "gooey?"  Sorry, but not really.  "Gooey" means delicious adhesive inside filling-stuff forming delicate little strings of fun and edible stringiness when I take a bite, like cheese from a hot pizza, or the caramel inside a Milky Way.  Sorry, but none of these cookies delivered anything like that.  The packaging has a picture of a cookie being split apart, with a web-like glob of gooey fudgy goodness being revealed (see image).  I attempted with six cookies to recreate this event, and did not succeed.  The cookie is too soft to be pulled apart in this fashion, and the fudge glob contained inside each cookie is insufficiently gooey to be pulled apart as depicted.<br /><br />The packaging also proclaims "megafudge."  Sorry, again, but I just didn't get the sense of megafudge.  "Fudge sufficient to be factory-injected into a cookie" is much more accurate. "Megafudge" is a villain in a cartoon movie, I think.<br /><br />From the date on the package, it appears you get a shelf life of roughly 3-4 months with an unopened package.<br /><br />The Product:<br /><br />While the cookies aren't officially bite-size, at about 2" across they pop in easily.<br /><br />You get about 18 cookies in the package.  That's about 9 servings, at 150 calories apiece, for a total of about 1350 calories in the package (about the same as a Baja Fresh steak quesadilla).  You essentially get no Vitamins A or C, or calcium; you do get 3.5g of saturated fat, though.<br /><br />Most of the cookies in my package were a bit beat-up and somewhat crumbly, likely from being mailed.  But that center of fudge kept them largely together; these cookies will not just break in half.<br /><br />The fudge is on the inside, but there are still some chocolate chips in the cookie dough itself, so this is something that will leave chocolate on your fingers and anything else it comes in contact with.  Giving a handful of these to a toddler in an all-white living room would be a bad idea.<br /><br />And how did the cookies taste?  Well, there was no overwhelming rush of fudge-tastical transcendence.  But neither was there any disappointment.  They taste just fine, as I would expect from a factory that makes tens of thousands of these a day.  The texture in the mouth is good, with just a little bit of pseudo-crunch from small white chocolate chips.  The taste is heavy on cocoa.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's a soft cookie with some squishy stuff in the middle, and it tastes just fine.  Not the best cookie I've ever had, not even close, but also a really long way from the worst cookie I've ever had.  If you like your chocolate and fudge and cocoa, this one will work for you.  If you like your chocolate taste more subtle, this isn't the best choice.

review/summary: Rocky Road in cookie form.
review/text: I don't eat cookies very much, but when I do, I tend to luck out and get good ones. I also managed to finally luck out with the Vine program, and got a sweet snack just before they were out of stock. The only other Chips Ahoy! cookies I've tried are the standard chocolate chip ones, and I thought they were ok. But good lord is this a huge step up from those. They aren't messing around with the name 'Gooey Megafudge'. These things are loaded with enough sugar to wipe out an entire village of diabetics. But hey, it's a tasty way to go.<br /><br />While I do agree that there's a kind of chalky taste to hem, I love the marshmallows they used for these. It reminded me of eating Rocky Road ice cream when it's really hot out, and the marshmallows are getting soft from the heat. The cookies are on the small side, but still have more than a fair share of calories. And depending on how big of a chocolate fan you are, one cookie just might be enough for a quick snack. For other parents out there, I'd watch it when leaving a pack of these within your child's reach, because two or three could have them bouncing around all over the place. As a whole, the cookies are better than I was expecting, and while it's obvious they're not healthy at all, there are better options out there for your cookie fix...though maybe not anywhere near as chocolatey.<br /><br />I doubt I'll buy a pack in the future, but everyone I've shared with seems to like them.

review/summary: Chocolate Delight!
review/text: I was expecting the worst when I chose to review these soft, gooey cookies, because I've never liked the texture of packaged soft cookies.  They've always tasted more like weirdly elastic edible plastic than honest food.  But it's been a few years since I've tried a soft cookie, and hey, chocolate and fudge -- it was time to see if they'd improved.<br /><br />I had second thoughts, looking at the package, wondering if some huge puddle of liquid fudge would squirt into my mouth, but once I opened them and saw their normal-cookie looks and, more importantly, got a whiff of mouth-watering chocolate, I promptly bit one in half.  No weird plastic bendiness to deal with, just some slightly crunchy little white chocolate chips and a quarter-sized bit of fudge filling in what my husband calls, rightly, a "cakey-brownie-like cookie."<br /><br />These little guys are perfect with milk or crumbled on ice cream, but my mate says they're best when you just let them melt on your tongue. That's when the fudge filling is most noticeable -- and in a very good way.<br /><br />We ate up the package of cookies much too fast and picked up another at the market.  That's how much we like them: we rarely buy cookies but we had to have more.

review/summary: Very soft, chocoately and delicous
review/text: I have a weakness for anything chocolate and these cookies did not disappoint. They are very soft, chewy and the chocolate flavor is fantastic (reminds me of Dutch processed cocoa). They are wonderful with milk. One cookie has 3.5g fat. It is very hard to only eat one of these.

review/summary: Yummy Chocolate Cookies
review/text: These cookies are soft and chewy just like you'd expect from Chips Ahoy, but they also contain gooey fudge inside.  They are definitely yummy and not too chocolatey, but I will say I expected more "gooey" from them and really inside the fudge is thicker and not really gooey at all.  Overall though they definitely satisfied my chocolate craving and I love that they were so soft.

review/summary: Don't waste your money on these
review/text: I've always like the Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies (I remember when they were much larger!).  That's why I thought I would try these but they are overly sweet with an artificial chocolate flavor.  Not worth the calories, salt and chemicals.  There are much better choices in cookies.

review/summary: Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge
review/text: The name of the cookies doesn't seem to match the cookies.  They are neither chewy nor gooey. They are rather ordinary cookies that have an odd artificial taste to them.  They are also on the small side, so at 150 calories for two cookies they would not be a wise choice for someone watching his weight.  The resealable package is a good idea.

review/summary: Soft and chocolatey but have an odd texture and flavor
review/text: These cookies were not bad, but they weren't really good either.  I was happy to find that they are very soft.  I prefer soft cookies.  The chocolate taste does come through.  However, the cookies are also a little gritty or sandy; the texture is very odd.  Also there is something in them that tastes a little off.  I've definitely had much better cookies like Soft Batch and Mrs. Fields.  For the price, they're not bad, but there are much better cookies out there.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: Yes they are moister than other chips ahoy, and yes they are darker brown. However they do not strike me as particularly "gooey" nor is there really any fudge taste, just a bland yet long-lingering generic sugar-and-chemicals taste. If you are somewhat indescriminate when it comes to fufilling your chocolate jones, go ahead and pick these up, you could do worse. But if you like your fudge to taste like fudge, keep looking.
