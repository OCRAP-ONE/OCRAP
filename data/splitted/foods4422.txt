review/summary: when kept in perspective...................
review/text: If you keep things in perspective, this is a great travel meal, student meal, or for my case, a trucker meal! :)<br /><br />It is pretty good overall, I love the gravy, and the potatoes taste and feel close to homemade, but the meatloaf borders on mystery meat, and almost pet food, honestly. The meat is obviously not pure meat, and considering the needs for price, microwavable, and preservation, I understand, and accept it.<br /><br />One of these meals satisfies my hunger for awhile, maybe an hour or two, it depends. I have paid in the range of $3.80 for these in truck stops and mini-marts as they are otherwise hard for me to find, being on the road. I can't easily get into a grocery store, or even a WM all the time, and most truck stops carry some variety of these meals.<br /><br />Seeing/finding them for much less here on Amazon makes me want to order a few hundred of these meals, in variety of course, because of the cost. I can't seem to eat a meal on the road for less than $10, and so paying 66% less is a no-brainer, and these meals in conjunction with maybe a few crackers and a soda do the job I need in a hurry :)<br /><br />For the record by the way, I love the spaghetti meals the best, they really are good!!!!!! :)

review/summary: It's OK aside from the Mash
review/text: I tried the Meatloaf & Roast beef and I can officially say I will not order any of these meals with mash potatoes in them. The mash is kinda hard and and has no flavor. The gravy from the meats don't help either. So yuk on the mash potatoes. As for the meatloaf, it was OK, not horrible but not worth eating or ordering again. I got the 6 pack and had just 1 and that's enough for me, I'm going to see if any of my neighbors want them, I really do not want to through them out. I would eat it only if I had no other food to eat in my house. So with that said, so far the turkey & dressing meal is the best. Roast beef & Mash worst then the meatloaf. I just ordered another pack of the turkey along with the Swedish Meatballs meal. Let's hope this one can be added to the yummy list and not the yuk list. Stay tuned.

review/summary: Tasty, Fast, and right-size for a low-cal lunch
review/text: I have tried several of these Hormel Compleats and am VERY satisfied.  So much so I have ordered 24 more.  I find they are inexpensive, fast to prepare (90 seconds), and taste very good for a quick microwave light meal.  I would advise that you have a little salt & pepper handy as they are made a bit bland to meet most tastes. I have these 2 or 3 times a week at work as it saves $$ on going out to a local fast food outlet and is still a good small meal.

review/summary: Was expecting much better
review/text: After trying the spaghetti and salisbury steak Hormel Compleats, I figured I couldn't go wrong with this line of products.  I ordered the meatloaf and a few others to try.  I was very disappointed by this particular "Compleat."  The mashed potatoes were tasteless and an odd consistency, and the meat and sauce had a very poor taste and looked like cat food.  I'm not exactly looking for a gourmet meal; I just want something that is fairly tasty and will hold me over for a few hours.  Hormel has provided me with this very option with their other meals, but this one just fell VERY short of the mark they had set.  Avoid the meat loaf and save yourself some money.

review/text: I love Hormel Compleats. They're all very convenient, since I can stash them in a cabinet in my office and not worry about remembering to bring something from home, or about it getting stolen from the communal refrigerator.<br /><br />This is about the saltiest of the Compleats I've tried. The potatoes are pasty and have little flavor. The meatloaf isn't bad, except for the salt factor.

review/summary: Tastes okay... but definitely doesn't taste like meatloaf
review/text: The Hormel Compleats really don't taste too bad considering the fact that you're purchasing a ready-to-eat meal that can be heated in 60 seconds. I have no problem with the flavor, overall, but some definitely taste better than others. Of all that I've tried, the meatloaf is my least favorite. The texture and smell kinda remind me of canned dog food. Seriously.<br />Otherwise...<br />I'd recommend the chicken and stuffing, chicken and mashed potatoes, turkey and stuffing, beef tips and potatoes. Those are all pretty good.<br />As for the comments about the potatoes being hard... this is true, but I think the reason is so that once they are heated with the gravy, you can mash them up with a fork without them ending up too runny.

review/summary: Decent flavor but way too much sodium!
review/text: For a basically dehydrated meatloaf & potato combo the flavor is not bad, and the slight rubber-like taste can be overcome by adding dill weed to both the meatloaf and potatoes, and copious amounts of butter to the taters. However, as has to happen with dehydrated meat, the salt count is off the charts. Other similar meals like Betty Crocker's old Homestyle complete meals didn't have as much. The amount of sodium in this makes my ulcer bleed. Yes, I have an ulcer, and being an uninsured American the best I can do is not aggravate it, and these meals do so badly I had to give away the remaining of my order after the first 2 I tried.<br /><br />If you have to avoid sodium, avoid this like the plague. If you need a quick meal, keep unsalted butter, pepper, and dill weed on hand to bolster the taste.

review/text: While providing a close approximation to surviving on wet shoe leather, eating the Hormel "Compleats" Meatloaf three times (in a week) has probably lowered my life expectancy. While fond of the Italianesque Compleats varieties (Manicotti and Spaghetti - a big wink to YOU), I have found the Meatloaf to be the kind of disappointment that seeks you out the moment the package gets warm enough in the microwave to release olfactory-offending molecules into the ether. And don't let the salt-lick finish fool you; there really is no flavor in that there white plastic tub. A longtime fan of other Hormel products, I found this one not to fit with the rest of their all-star lineup.

review/summary: Not reccommended for anyone whose tastebuds have not been burned off.
review/text: This item has some limited positives, as follows:<br /><br />+ Edible.<br />+ Refrigeration not necessary, so good for emergency preparation.<br />+ Decent shelf life of more than a year.<br />+ Could be eaten without heating, if necessary.<br />+ Relatively low (310) calories, though not a significant amount of food, either.<br />+ Cooks in 90 seconds.<br /><br />I would classify this as satisfactory for emergency kits, alongside the cardboard-flavored granola bars, but little else.<br /><br />The item doesn't have very many negatives, but they're hard to overcome. The first is an extremely high sodium content. People are going nuts over sodium these days, which is ridiculous. However, one of these contains as much as half of the suggested daily sodium intake. That's a lot for such a small item.<br /><br />Most disappointing, is the flavor. Actually, that's inaccurate. Complaining about the flavor suggests that there is any. If instant mashed potatoes made from flakes with water and no milk or butter or salt was rated as a five on the flavor intensity scale, where ten is the most intense flavor you've ever experienced, I would rate this meatloaf and mashed potatoes as a one.<br /><br />There is no difference between the potatoes and the meat. They share the same flavor (or lack thereof) and nearly the same texture. Only the color gives you any suggestion that there are two different items of food in the container. The gravy is no better. It's brown and tastes . . . well, it has no flavor, either. A brown crayon would be more flavorful.<br /><br />I have never been in the military, but I suspect this is very similar to MREs. Actually, for the sake of those in the military, I have to believe that MREs are not this bland.

There's no way you're getting into these snacks without some scissors. You would think if they cost that much, they could at least have a way to get the packages open.

review/summary: A great lazy man's pantry dessert
review/text: I admit it. I love brownies from a box. There.<br /><br />Generally speaking, I cook from scratch, but brownie mix, I like. Honestly, I like these as well as homemade, and there's no mess. These are a little stingy with the nuts, but otherwise delicious, easy & cheap. I use melted butter instead of oil & my other favorite way to eat them is to bake them for 10 minute less than recommended and serve the hot half-baked goo with ice cream.

review/summary: Thank You Evolve!
review/text: I have a cat with a VERY sensitive tummy. For two years everything he ate he vomited. I tried meds from his vet, and I think every type of cat food and diet under the sun for him, and although some combos reduced the vomiting frequency - he was still doing it. One day I saw Evolve, and said why not - not really thinking it would change. I was so wrong! He has been on it for over a year now and no vomiting - not once! Also, we have another cat with a regular tummy and she loves it too.<br /><br />Thank you Evolve!<br />Abby & Coconut

review/summary: Tasty Tasty Tasty !
review/text: I used to get these at Kroger grocery in Georgia and NC but sadly they disappeared. If anyone knows a source and would be willing to share that would be excellent. They are a unique taste that does not compare to any other I have tried. I agree that shipping is high but I have just placed my second order. A word of caution though, my first order was basically 6 jars of pickles in a box loosely bubble wrapped, needless to say the box was all wet and to my dismay a tragic scene of delicious Heinze pickles and glass were all over the inside of the box. I notified the company and they credited back the cost of the one broken jar to my credit card but still the trauma lives in my mind as I salivate thinking of what might have been.

review/text: I absolutely love "Heinz Genuine Dill Pickles". I have four children who love them as well. Sadly, you can never find them in the grocery stores. It cost a great deal more to order them shipped directly to me, but if I can't get Heinz, I don't get anything. I am more than willing to pay the extra cost if that's what it takes. I hope they never stop making them. They truly are wonderful.

review/summary: Absolutely the Best Pickle in the World
review/text: What more can I say.  I agree with everyone else.  They quit selling them in my area, Fort Worth, Texas about five years ago.  Big Lots advertized them and I bought every jar I could find at all the Big Lots stores.  But, sadly, they have been gone for a couple of years.  I look at every pickle counter in every store hoping to find them, but to no avail.  I have missed them so much and never thought of shopping on amazon. I just thought they were gone forever. My mouth is watering right now, just in anticipation of eating one.  PS:  I like mine better at room temperature, but you have to put them in the fridge after a couple of days.  OMG they do make the potato salad.  I just can't wait until I get my jars.

review/summary: Only the best pickles ever
review/text: I was first introduced to Heinz Genuine Dills by my grandmother who used them in potato salad for "the kick."  They are strong on dill and brine flavor, not so much on the garlic that some other pickles exude.  The pickles are also crunchier (my opinion only) than some other varieties making them an excellent choice for mixed applications -- no one in my family is fond of mushy pickles in their chicken/tuna/potato salad.  My local mega-marts don't carry them so it was great to find them available on-line.

review/text: I grew up on these pickles, and also experienced years where I could not find them in the super market.  Years ago, the label read: Heinz "Cured in Wood" Genuine Dills, and this is definitely the same pickle.  Tastes like the old fashioned deli pickles.  Thank goodness I finally did find some at our local HyVee Grocery store.  If your grocer does not carry them -- ASK FOR THEM!  I always buy two or three jars just in case.  They really are the real deal.  I'm a baby boomer and these are the pickles you remember.

review/summary: Yes you can afford good dill pickles
review/text: If you're reading this, you probably already know what it's like to eat a good dill pickle.  Fresh, fragrant, grassy notes from the dill and the crisp cucumber rind.  A mouth-watering acidity that's held in balance with pungent oils leached from coriander, mustard, allspice, and black pepper seeds.  Substantial, satisfying garlic low notes.  And an invisible, bright salinity.  But you already know this, because these are the pickles your DNA has been instructing you to eat.<br /><br />Incidentally, like all fruits, these pickled cucumbers have flavors that bloom when they are brought up to room temperature.<br /><br />They're also delicious in a hot pickle soup- a quick, light, and rustic soup of mirepoix, sliced potatoes, and diced pickles simmered to tender in a rich chicken stock with a bit of milk, and served with light garnish of fresh parsley, dill, and sour cream.  Niech zyje Polska, of course.

review/text: I had been in search for the best pickle for months. I bought every name brand out there. None were to my liking until one day I happen to come across a jar of Heinz Dill pickles that was located in the ketchup aisle and not in the pickle aisle. I decided to buy it as my one last try to find the perfect pickle.  When I got home I chilled it for a day and finally grabbed one to taste and "Holy Testicles Batman" was it the best thing ever.  It's crisp, perfect amount of salt, and all around the BEST pickle I've ever had.  I now only buy Heinz Dill Pickles. I recommend to all pickle loves to try it.  You won't be disappointed.

review/text: I enjoy these pickles, and wonder why they can't be found in stores anymore. A genuine sour Dill, not Kosher and Not Polish, which is all you Can find.  The pickle mob must have muscled everyone else out?  These are the perfect dill pickle for anything you'd use one for.<br />I'd ordered from another source but that product was damaged in shipping and returned before it even arrived at the destination.  I noted the damage as I was tracking the shipment.  These 3 jars came in a box full of those soft plastic peanuts, and each jar was heavily wrapped in bubble wrap and still in the center of the box surrounded by the peanuts when it arrived.  You weren't going to damage these jars unless you ran over the box.  Completely satisfied.

review/summary: Dogs LOVE this!
review/text: I have two dogs. A terrier-poodle (5 years old, 13 pounds), and a purebred maltese (4 years old, 7 pounds). They are both very active, and maintain their weight without much difficulty. They are healthy and active dogs, and I absolutely adore them! I care about the foods that they eat, so I make a concerted effort to make sure that I am feeding them the best foods that I can provide. While I believe the best foods, nutritionally, are whole foods, eating human foods frequently has not been good for my doggies teeth. It makes their breath smell worse and increases the plaque on their teeth.<br /><br />The next best option is frozen dog food or raw bones, but neither of those options are suitable to our lifestyle. So I look for dry dog kibble made with a solid ingredient profile.<br /><br />With the melamine, pet-food scare that was in the news a while back, I was/am more comfortable with food that is made in North America. FirstMate owns and operates their facilities in British Columbia, Canada. They were the first company to produce grain-free food in 1995. 73% of the protein is from wild herring (local from BC!) & Chicken. The remaining 27% of protein is from the barley, rice, oatmeal and potato.<br /><br />My dogs are happy on this food. It doesn't seem to cause them any stomach upset, excess gas, and their coats are nice and shiny. 5 out of 5 in my books. :)

review/summary: LOVE Welsh's Grape Jelly! But. this item is no longer PRIME! :(
review/text: *UPDATED REVIEW * -June 14-2012<br /> Finally! I see a decent price posted! Was gonna stock up but just my luck only one left in stock!<br />But bravo! to this company for listening to my suggestion. I'll most likely be purchasing more. As soon as you as more available that is! And...depending upon what you're charging for S & H because Ive noticed this is no longer a Prime item. :( I can't complain too much about your cost of the jelly though. It's. An average fair price. So.. thank you for lowering it.<br /><br />- May 17th-2012<br />I was contacted by the seller regarding my disappointment in the outlandish price I'd paid for my jelly. They wanted to know what they could do to satisfy me as a customer? I'd mentioned how the price was much cheaper at my store & if they could lower their price here so I may purchase it again in the future.  The seller was quick to respond with an offer for a nice refund in an attempt to match my local price.  It still cost me more through Amazon but, I paid for the convenience of home delivery. Therefore, I gladly accepted the offer. It was also mentioned that my request to lowering their price would be brought forward at their next meeting. It appears they have indeed lowered the price from $10.98 to $8.48. If you have Amazon Prime, your shipping & handling is FREE and the total price balances out. I would possibly consider paying that price,  especially if I'd bought other items. However, if you need to include S & H, then the $8.48 price is still much too high. I'd like to see this item at $4.98 but, no more than $5.98. I'd be able to place it on my Subscribe & Save List<br /><br />*ORIGINAL REVIEW*- April 16th-2012<br />I really should have done my homework before buying from this seller but, I needed grape jelly for a last minute get together & was in a hurry so, it's my own fault that I ended up paying much more than I should have.<br /><br />Welsh's has THE best grape jelly there is! Made from Concord Grapes which gives the jelly that special flavor that other grapes can't provide. Welch's Concord Grape Jelly is made with all natural ingredients, too. No artificial flavors or colors here!<br /><br />But, like I said, I'm disappointed in the price I'd paid.  I was at the grocery store yesterday and I noticed the same jelly on the shelf. Same amount; packaged together, jars of two-32oz. in plastic jar containers. Then I see the price...$3.56. Three dollars and fifty-six cents!! This was sold to me on Amazon for $10.98!!!! 3x times the amount I could have paid at my local grocery store!<br /><br />I'll be sure to compare prices before making a final purchase in the future...

Coffee Masters makes incredible coffee (the toffee crunch is my favorite) but the price is generally prohibitive for me (typically $33 for 4 11/12 oz bags).  I got this on sale as an Amazon warehouse deal.  I am always watching them, and when they go on sale I buy Coffee Masters flavored coffees.

review/summary: Not even real orange bitters
review/text: I can only imagine that the other reviewers are principals in the company selling this product.<br /><br />This is one of the most disappointing bar purchases I've ever made. If you look at the ingredients before you purchase the bottle, you won't purchase the bottle. I had read about Fee Brothers Bitters in an old New York Times article about the rebirth of cocktail culture, and I had very high hopes. Unfortunately, I assumed they were artisanal and naturally flavored, and alcoholic like Peychaud's or Angostura. The ingredients list reads like a pack of Orange Drink: Water, Glycerin, Flavors - Natural and Artificial Extracts and Flavors. Also, no alcohol, which is a no-no, if you're mixing real drinks.<br /><br />These bitters taste bad. They smell like an orange popsicle but have a truly bad and overpowering votive candle scent. If you want orange flavor in your drinks, pick any other orange bitters. This is a sure way to water down your drink, without adding natural flavor. I've used this in a couple of drinks and been duly disappointed in each one. The only tastes it imbues are those of chemicals and sourness. DO NOT USE THESE BITTERS!!!

review/summary: Fee Brothers does it again
review/text: The Orange Bitters is your classic martini add-in.  As others have pointed out Fee Brothers bitters aren't alcoholic.  This has advantages and disadvantages of course.  For me - I don't really care.  you're adding like 4 drops to a glass - will the alcohol in Angostura actually make a significant difference in the content or taste?  I enjoy this in a dry martini with a twist of orange peel.  It goes well with more "citrus leaning" gins such as Finger Lakes Distilling's Seneca Drums Gin or New Amsterdam.  Fees also offers a new artisinal west indian orange bitters and orange bitters aged in gin caskets <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007KAWF92">Fee Bros. Gin Barrel-Aged Drink Bitters</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CDTO88">Fee Brothers Orange Bitters EACH</a>, each with their own distinct flavor.

review/text: Soooo glad I got three boxes of these sent to me. NOT I have one dog I am trying to please and another who will eat anything... well even she has to be coxed into eating these. I love the whole idea and ingredients of these goodies but they just wont work for my dogs. They look like little alfalfa cubes and the dogs wont even take them from my hand. I did see my one dog eat one after it set out on the porch all night but I think she was just board waiting for her morning meal. Give these a pass unless your dog is really into veggie treats.

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: For about a year now, I've been really been getting into tea drinking, not so much because I wish to increase in hipsterness, but because I've heard all of the health benefits and figured since I smoke, the least I could do is cut down on coffee and drink a few cups of tea a day, to reduce cancer risk as well as help the ole ticker and bloodflow, which has it's own benefits if you know what I mean...  So far what I've discovered is Monkey Picked Oolong and Silver Needle White tea are by far my top 2 in taste.  Since I'm drinking tea for health reasons, I don't add milk, cream, honey, or fancy German rock sugar as that would appear to defeat the purpose.  (Yes honey is natural but still freaking sugar.)  Those 2 types of tea seem to be naturally sweet, especially the silver needle white.  I gave some to a friend and he asked how much honey I put in it.  "NONE, motha%#$@^!  That @$#! is straight white tea, *&^%$!" :O  Most Black teas, even expensive highly rated ones seem to taste like hot unsweetened Lipton, meh.  Rooibos tastes like it smells: Hay/cattle feed pellets, bleh, very disappointed.  Pu'erh was decent but much like Black. I haven't tried loose leaf green tea yet but will soon.  But Oolong?  Yes please.  I've tried several, including Teavana's Monkey Picked and it is indeed very high quality and perhaps a little more 'vegetal?, with giant expanding leaves but it's roughly twice the price of EnjoyingTea's, which is similar.  And that's a very good thing, slightly vegetal /slightly sweet, and you can 'feel' it adding to your lifespan with every sip.  Ah.  I tried Rishi's silver needle white and it's just plain amazing but pricey.  I just ordered some from EnjoyingTea and am guessing I will soon wind down the testing phase of my tea experience and decide on EnjoyingTea's Monkey Picked Oolong and Silver Needle White (pending taste test) as my 'everydayers' due to a yet unmatched combo of quality and price.  5 stars.

review/text: Some of these chocolates were good, but others had a flavor I'd call plastic-y.  The chocolate labeled as being a mocha flavor had no discernable coffee taste about it at all, just a milk chocaletyness (it tasted good, but not as promised).  To order these through the mail, then get two tiny boxes--and not even be interested in ever opening the second one--I'd say the effort and results would be better just to go to the local See's candy shop-- and I'm not even a See's fan.  Well, maybe I am NOW.<br /><br />The quality-to-price ration is completely off.  I wasted my money.

review/summary: A surprisingly complex taste for an ultra hot sauce
review/text: I enjoy all types of hot sauces but I prefer those with complex flavors, not just heat.  Black Mamba is hot, make no mistake about it, but it also has an almost fruity flavor to it (by the way, Chocolate Habaneros are called that because of their color, not their flavor.)  It does have hot pepper extract in it (capsaicin) which is often added to mediocre sauces just in order to boast the heat, sometimes at the expense of the overall taste of the finished product.  Black Mamba seems to have limited the amount to just enough to create even more fire than a habanero has own it's own (and Chocolate Habs are one of the hottest) without overdoing it.<br /><br />When I open the lid there is usually a small dab of the sauce on the inside of the cap.  I touch my finger to it and transfer about two drops to my mouth.  The heat is relatively slow, building up over a matter of a dozen or so seconds until my face starts to feel flushed.  After a full minute I feel perspiration on my brow and the pain starts to pleasantly build.  Not so much pain that I feel miserable, just enough to feel that endorphin rush that a good sauce brings with it.  The pain goes away in about 10 minutes but I am still left with some wonderful flavors in my mouth.<br /><br />This is the type of sauce that I add to a large pot of soup or chili, a glaze for meat and to add a punch to a stew or a curry.  One thing to note though; this is a VERY small bottle.  Two ounces is about 60 milliliters (one of those airplane bottles of liquor holds only 50 ml.)  I feel that the price is pretty high for such a small amount of sauce.  Still, it is tasty and I am glad that I bought it.

review/summary: Just wait for it...
review/text: I tried this at my brothers rehearsal dinner as a dare that clearly I was not going to turn down.  I put one drop on a tortilla and started chewing.  I thought I was in the clear until about 20 seconds later when my mouth was on fire.  I love hot sauces and regularly use very hot ones and this put them all to shame.  I was chomping down tortillas and it took a good 30 minutes for the burn to stop.  I was very pleased with this sauce but buyer beware--- this is not for those who can't handle heat.

review/summary: Heat without compromising flavor
review/text: One of my friends is a chocolatier. He was looking for interesting ingredients to add to his confections, so someone bought him a bottle of Black Mamba. He added 1 drop per 1oz square of ultra rich milk chocolate. After the first bite, I was impressed with the complex taste of the hotsauce, and how nicely it complemented the flavors in the chocolate though I was a little underwhelmed with the heat. Boy way I wrong.<br /><br />Over the next 5 minutes or so, the heat continued to grow. I felt the burn in my mouth, and my nose started to run. After about 10 minutes, I was sweating and my face was about 6 shades of red. At that point, he brought me a glass of milk and bowl of pretzels. Initially, I had pushed them aside, but the heat lingered long enough that the endorphins started to wear off and I ended up giving in to the starchy, creamy relief of milk and pretzels. If I didn't have them, I wouldn't have been miserable, unlike with some other hot sauces, but I definitely wouldn't have been comfortable.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great spicy hot sauce that doesn't compromise on taste. My pet peeve with hot sauces are heat at the expense of taste. This one delivers on both fronts. At $15 per 2oz, it's a bit expensive for daily use, but to spice up special treats, it's a must.

review/summary: Hot, naughty and bothersome!
review/text: The sauce is both hot and tasty. I've read online that the sauce is estimated to be in excess of 2 million SCU's. That's BS. I'd equate the heat to habanero seeds. Incorporating 4-5 drops on a burger or bowl of soup will certainly give your food some kick. I'll concede that the sauce is more about heat than flavor. With that said, the flavor is still pretty damn good. I got my bottle roughly 4 months ago and I've almost finished it. I intend to get another bottle when this one's done.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention, this sauce makes for a horrible masturbation aid! I know that a lot of you are thinking about it but don't do it. Trust me......DON'T!!!!

review/summary: Wonderful Product!
review/text: I LOVE this product!  Ah-Choo Chest Rub is the first product I turn to when my children start coming down with a cold.  It has a very strong, yet pleasant lavender and eucalyptus scent, and a natural yellow color.  It does help relieve congestion and it seems to reduce night-time coughing in my kids.  They love having Ah-Choo rubbed on their chests and backs, and sometimes directly under their noses.  I have even used this rub  to clear up minor rashes and dry skin.  If you have the choice between Nature's Baby Organics and Vicks, go with the clear winner- Nature's Baby Organics.  Vicks is petroleum (yuck!) based and contains "fragrance" and other chemicals.  Ingredients in products applied to skin go to directly into the blood stream, so it's wise, especially when a child's immune system is already compromised, to apply a natural rub when the option is available.  Highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Effective for mama..but irritating to baby!
review/text: This ointment is very good on my sensitive skin and my husband's..non-irritating and gentle.  We use it for stuffiness during a common cold episode.  On the other hand, our toddler son who has sensitive skin cannot use this product as I'd hoped and bought it for.  I love the natural ingredients of the product but there is something that I can't pinpoint in this product that broke my toddler son out in a rash.  I used it on his chest, back, and a small bit under his nose during a common cold episode.  Subsequently, his cheeks became a little irritated. Also, his back and chest broke out in a rash.  Luckily it went away when I discontinued use on him.  I knew that this ointment was the contributing factor because although he has sensitive skin, I have narrowed down what works for him without breaking him out.  I cannot say that it won't work for other toddlers/babies but I can say that proceeding with caution is one's best bet as there may be irritants in this product...so be very careful.  It's a good thing though that by me having two jars, my husband and I can still use the ointment without a problem.  I have to say that it did seem to calm my boy before bedtime and helped to clear his nasal passages.  Overall, an OK product but I have to keep looking for another natural ointment that will not irritate my boy's skin.

review/text: A soothing product with only the best ingredients!  What I love about Nature's Baby Organics is that they are consistently reliable with their products.  I never have to worry about whether they've changed the ingredients and I know it's good quality stuff.  If it weren't for this product, I would have to make it myself because nothing else on the market compares.  My whole family has really enjoyed this chest rub, even when no one has a cold.  It's great for under little noses, too!

review/summary: Not sure if it helps with congestion
review/text: Our 9 month old has had chronic runny nose since he was about 2 months old.  Bought this to help him breathe better at night.  He still wakes up with a stuffy nose, so I'm not sure how much it's actually helping.  However, I do love the smell (it smells amazing) so I will continue to use it on him.

review/text: We are major Ah-Choo disciples, and have been using it for several months now on our toddlers.  Unfortunately, the couple of Ah-Choo!s that were sent to us seem fake.  I actually smell Vaseline more than anything else.  I can barely smell the eucalyptus.  What I liked about Ah-Choo! is that just by sniffing it, I felt calmer and my nostrils felt clearer.  My son always used to sleep better with the Ah-Choo! rubbed on chest.  We always purchased our Ah-Choo!s from our local organic supermarket, but they had no more of it so we resorted to purchasing it from Amazon.  I feel absolutely nothing from what was sent to me, and my son remains congested.  Have they changed the formula of Ah-Choo?  (Companies, I know, do that all the time.)  Or, is what was sent to me fake?  Well, we are disappointed in the product now.

review/text: for me, this product is just like the vick's but has a much more stronger smell. It didn't really help all that much with my baby's stuffy nose maybe it'll help more with the cough.

review/summary: Yum, Healthy snack that tastes wonderful!
review/text: I highly recommend these. They have lots of fiber and they taste really good. I bought the last my store had, and they only got them in for a one time thing. I tried several other brands, however they tasted horrible! So I searched on Amazon and found them. I had to get 12 bags, but that's OK, they will last! You won't be sorry for buying this taste good healthy snack!

review/text: I don't have much to say other than I love sesame seeds and the flavor of this sticks is great, my kids and wife also love them too. I know when we are talking about food opinions differ a lot but at least you now know that 4 people like them, to be honest I can eat a whole bag watching a movie. We bought them at a different store at 1.30 a bag plus tax so it is almost the same price as amazon so I am about to buy a pack of 12 (probably 2 packs to get the free shipping) and I'll save a trip to the store. To me it is worth it.
