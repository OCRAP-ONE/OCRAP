review/summary: Well made, but only for the very food motivated
review/text: I bought the Tug Jug for my dog because she was jealous of the cat's Slim Kitty food dispenser and she likes to play with rope toys.  I guess jealousy and rope are not enough motivation for her to play with it.  They need to be very food motivated because it is very challenging to get the treats out, and unfortunately she isn't a big eater.  It is a very sturdy and well made toy, and it is not as easy for them to get the food out as the other treat dispensing toys that roll around.  She only shows interest in it if I play with it with her.  I could see how it would be a great toy for the very food motivated dog who has a lot of dexterity.  Also a funny side note, the package came to me opened by the post office already because apparently on x-ray in looks like something dangerous.  Someone thought that a person would buy a molotov cocktail on Amazon, I guess.

review/summary: Hard to interest my pooch.
review/text: I have a 16lb Dachsund and we have a very hard time finding toys that she is interested in. We adopted her, and her home before us was as a breeder at a puppy mill where they kept her in a crate her whole life. So long story short, she has no idea what to do with toys and really, I'm out of ideas. She gets interested at first, but has a really hard time manuevering the bottle to get the treats out (she has had back surgery to repair paralysis in her hind end from ruptured discs so is not super agile). Also I think my little wiener has a little trouble figuring it out and I'm not sure how else to show her. I do like to toy and it has withstood her frustrations but I think I need more help with it. Some helpful hints or instructions would be greatly appreciated.

review/summary: Dog Loves it
review/text: My 13 lb dachshund is extremely destructive with his toys and needs a lot of interaction with most toys constantly.  I filled this toy with organic cheerio type cereal and he was delighted.  It took him about 3 minutes to work out how to get the treats out.<br /><br />I dropped a star because he is able to pull small chunks off the purple molding.  I sort of expected that because he is like that with everything though.  Luckily, he spits the rubber out after he pops it off, so I can let him play with it when I am home to supervise his play.

review/text: My dog just isn't a "tugger" by nature. She doesn't get this toy, and the same hard plastic that makes it super durable also makes it super LOUD when it hits the hardwood floor. Noise=scary. My dog developed a phobia of this toy long before she ever figured out how to get the food out of it. I had to pass it along to someone else. Hopefully it will find a home with a dog who really loves it.

review/text: The toy got a lot of interest, but I eventually had to take it away because of the way my dogs chose to play with it. They would grab it by the rope and shake their heads to release this treats, subsequently beating walls (or worse, human legs) that were near them. It appeared to be sturdy, and probably would have been a good toy otherwise.

review/summary: Cute...but not Westie-proof
review/text: Got this for my West Highland Terrier for Christmas and she loved it.  It kept her busy as soon as we gave it to her.  She was completely focused on getting those treats out of the bottle...however, she re-invented the toy and got all of the treats out by actually chewing through the thick rope that is attached to the toy.  (She managed to do this in about 5 minutes in a roomful of people.)  It's a cute toy and a great concept - and she did enjoy it - however, I think this toy would work best with a dog who is not quite as focused, or creative in problem-solving as our westie seems to be.  The plastic bottle and rubbery ball are very sturdy and are continuing to hold up well.

review/summary: Cool, but my dog quickly destroyed it
review/text: I wanted to use this as an alternative to a Kong, to fill with lunch for my dog on days when she would be alone all day while I was at work, and my husband was out of town. The product arrived with a rubber "rope" with a ball-like bulge on the outside, and a cone-shaped plug on the inside, rather than the actual rope pictured on the page. For the first 3 days, it was wonderful. She was very excited and interested in how it worked, and it seemed to keep her occupied. On the fourth day, when I got home, I saw her chewing on the little ball-like bulge, which she had handily chewed off of the rubber "rope". I worry that she would be able to chew off other pieces, and that she could choke on a lump of rubber that size, so I haven't used the product since then. Too bad, because it seemed neat. I would only recommend this product if your dog is a VERY weak chewer.

review/text: While the concept is great - my dog LOVES empty pop bottles - he doesn't have any interest in this particular toy. I think it is pretty sturdy, though I may not be the best judge as he hasn't really played hard with it. He has a ton of toys and this is his least favorite. It really is a good idea though and I do like how well it was made.

review/text: The rope part of the toy that the dog is supposed to tug on to get the treats out is rubber and not rope as shown in the product pocture. My 45lb border collie mix chewed through that in almost record time.<br /><br />He really likes the toy. He just picks it up now by the knobby top and drops it to get the treats out. I will probably try to put an actual rope and stopper in to fix it. I am just disappointed that it wasn't as shown.

review/text: We had an earlier model of this jug, with a rope instead of the rubber "rope."  My dog was able to get the food out a little easier, which I preferred.  This rubber thing in the middle quite effectively blocks the food and my dog gives up.  She used to eat her whole meal everyday in the old jug.  So I am disappointed they changed it.

review/summary: Great for a food driven dog
review/text: My youngest Miniature Schnauzer is very food driven. I'm not sure why but he has always had a bad habit of "wolf"ing down his food.  I have resorted to locking him in a seperate room, away from my other two Miniature Schnauzers, placing a tennis ball in the middle of his bowl and feeding him large kibble sized chunks of food to get him to slow down during feeding time.<br /><br />Toys like the "Premier Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug" is great to keep him busy and entertained because if there is food in there, he's going to work at it until he can get to it.<br /><br />It took him a little while to 'get' that the food comes out of the front of the jug and previously he was trying to pry off the bottom, chew the front , purple hard rubber ring around the neck of the bottle and then he finally figured out how to get the food out and is content trying to do so until all the food it gone.<br /><br />My other two are just not that determined.<br /><br />I agree with everyone here, if you have an aggressive chewer this may not be the best toy but if your dog isn't an aggressive chewer but a food driven dog this toy will keep him busy.

review/summary: Pretty good, but doesn't hold my dog's interest
review/text: My Westie liked this at first, but it didn't really hold his interest.  Plus, you have to fill the bottle about half full.  He gets bored after removing a few items, and then you either have to waste the food by replacing it with smellier food, or just leave it sitting around.  I think I just need to try with food he enjoys more, but I wanted the point to be that he would eat his regular food from this toy.

review/summary: Very engaging
review/text: This is the first morning my dog is using this toy. So far, it seems great. She is a 7-month old german shepherd/husky mix with a lot of energy who loves to play and figure things out. Sadly, she has a soft-tissue injury so is not allowed any walks, running or playing in the park for 3 whole weeks! We needed to find alternative outlets for her energy so she wouldn't turn into a raving beast from the frustration. The Tug-a-Jug has kept her full and undivided attention for 45 minutes so far. We also purchased the Busy Buddy Bouncy Bone, which she also loves. I'm very happy with this product. She's a powerful chewer, so I know she's going to chew right through the rope and spikey ball on the top. But I will take the advice of another reviewer and just put a tennis ball inside and I am sure it will still work just as well.

review/summary: Better, but still room for improvement
review/text: I bought the largest size available which was described as "medium/large" for my 25lb dog.  The toy was delivered and was too big.  The old versions had a rope but now the 'rope' is made out of that purple rubbery stuff that's much more durable and will last longer.  My dog was fine with playing with it on the carpet, but on linoleum or hardwood floors it's way too loud.  And who wants to use it on carpet when food leaves crumbs and stains?  The plastic bangs on the floor and my dog is timid to begin with and can't deal with the noise even with high reward treats.  I also don't want to teach him that making loud noises is okay. I returned this.  They should line the bottom and top sides of the bottle with the rubbery stuff so it isn't so noisy.

review/summary: We loved it, but...
review/text: My boston loves this toy!  It keeps her busy for quite a while and she's a heavy chewer, so it held up... for a while.  Like others, she has managed to chew her way through the rubber rope that comes out the end, but only a little at a time.  I keep a good eye on it and when it looks like she's about to get another piece off, I just cut that little bit off with a pair of scissors.  But the fact that it can be cut with scissors might give you a clue as to the constitution of the rubber rope.  Also, the plastic jug is fairly durable, but in her frustration to get at the kibble inside, Roxy has done a little damage to the plastic, making it hard to screw the lid back on straight.  So the good news is, great concept for a little dog (it's a small toy, don't give it to a lab, that's not what it was meant for), but maybe not as indestructable as they might think.  I'll buy another one, mainly because Roxy went into hysterics when I tried to hide it from her for a few days.  Clearly her favorite of all toys!  Doesn't want to eat out of her dish anymore!

review/summary: Quite the workout - but maybe a bit too difficult
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>This video shows Taxi (soft coated wheaten terrier) opening and playing with his Christmas/10th Birthday present... a Tug-a-Jug. He's played with it a few times now and he still doesn't get that he needs to pull the cord to get the treats to come out -- although he really enjoys knocking it around until the treats accidentally fall out. I bought the large size after reading the reviews because of the cord. The large size had the plastic cord which is easier to clean. The smaller size has the rope cord. Taxi is not a big chewer, so I felt comfortable that this toy would durable - and it is. I filled it with stinky treats which he can smell through both ends... but those treats upset his tummy a bit, so I'm going to have to try something else. I couldn't find the ingredients of the treats that are sold with the Tug-a-Jug, so I didn't buy those.

I was a little unsure that this would keep my little # 3 BT  busy, but it does. It also keeps #2 BT busy, but #1 BT just wants you to shake the treats out. The only problem I have is finding treats small enough to work in it. Sometimes I just put their dog food in it and they still love to play with it. I definitely would recommend this dog toy to anyone who very active dogs it does keep them busy.

review/summary: Not exactly self serve
review/text: There are 2 design issues with this toy: 1. in order for the rope to go back in, it needs to be PUSHED back in - this is difficult for a dog to accomplish without human help as it is not a stiff rope, but a flexible one. 2. When the dog pulls on the rope, it lifts the bottle up into an upright position, and when it's vertical the treats don't come out.<br /><br />My dog quickly figured out that the best way for the toy to "work" was if I set it up and let him pull the rope out while I held the bottle horizontal. So my dreams of independent play have not yet been realized.

review/text: I got this and the "tricky treat ball" in the same order.  Both are treat-dispensing toys that keep dogs occupied for longer than most other toys.  My basset hound likes both toys, but seems to really like the tug-a-jug.  I put his kibble in there and it keep him occupied for quite a while.  He really likes grabbing the rope, and unlike the picture the rope on mine is made of rubber instead of twine.  It will probably not last long.  Also, this toy is LOUD.  Much louder than the tricky treat ball.  But, he seems to prefer this over the ball, so it gets my recommendation.

review/summary: Very good toy!  Wish it was a little harder to get the food out though.
review/text: This is by far the best doggy toy I have ever bought.  I wish it was a little harder to get the food out.  My dog Bailey is a master at pulling the rope stopper in and out to get out the little bits.  I tried putting in bigger dog treats, but they are too big.  Smaller dog food slides out pretty easily if Bailey gives the jar a whack.  He can get all the food out in under 15 minutes.  I need a puzzle toy that is more difficult so he can be distracted for hours.  If the puzzle toy is too difficult, he usually just gives up.<br /><br />But it's an awesome toy because it makes your dog think a lot and keeps them distracted, because lord knows that if puppies aren't distracted, they are going to want to play with you!

review/text: I had to review this toy because it is one of VERY few that has not been destroyed within days (sometimes minutes).  Very good durability - the rattling of treats in the jar and the difficulty of getting to them perplexed my golden mix.  She likes this toy, but still prefers her treat-dispensing ball as she has become a master at rolling it to extract the treats.  I give the product 4.5 stars (but I rounded up) for standing up to the first two days of her chewing and trying to get the treats out without solving the puzzle.  It loses a half star because she generally gets disinterested after a few minutes of not being able to get treats out.  She does like to carry it around though!  Great toy overall!

review/summary: GREAT TOY!!!
review/text: Our lab mix, Walter, is a power-chewer and most toys that are not very hard don't last long with him. I saw this silly-looking toy at Walgreen's and it said it is bullet-proof plastic so I got it. My husband was skeptical and asked, "Yeah, but is it Walter-proof?" It is!!! Of course, the rope was history before 2 minutes passed and nearly all the rubber is off the top, but the hard plastic is scratched but still intact. I break up his hard biscuits and feed them through the top (the bottom screws off but if you put them through the top, you know they can fall out during play) and Walter flings it to the ground and rolls it around the get the treats to fall out. He loves it and it's almost always in his mouth. This is, hands down, his favorite toy. But, he's a smart dog and learned from a different toy (rubber ball with a hole in it) how to work treats out of a toy. You may have to demonstrate how it works to your dog.

review/text: I have two friends who have gotten this for their dogs and the dogs absolutely love it.  The bottom unscrews making it easy to put treats in.  Small kibble works best.  My Rottweiler doesn't really play with it, but I think it's just because it bangs against the hardwood floor and the noise scares him.  I'm going to try it outside once the weather gets nice.

review/summary: great idea but...
review/text: I was dissapointed in this one. The only way to get the treats out is to tug it on the ground but the rope encourages the dog to carry it around, throw it around etc... You have to fill it up to get the treats to come out and sorry but I don't want to give my dog 2 days worth of food. Maybe I would have been better off buying the smaller one.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: My 1 year old Boxer mix absolutely loves this toy ~ He was trying to play with it before I could even get it out of the packaging! It seems to be durable and is holding up well so far, my only concern is replacing the rope after my dog wears it out (he destroys rope toys in about 2 weeks usually). Other than that, I would recommend this to other dog owners whose dogs like to chew and play tug-of-war. Just make sure you don't mind little pieces of treats all over your floor - it's surprising how much treat actually dispenses, and my dog tends to overlook some of the dispensed treats when he is feeling playful. I wouldn't recommend this for small dogs, just because it is a good sized toy, but for medium to large dogs, this is great!

review/summary: Must Work For Food
review/text: Bottom screws open for easy loading. Last night,  I took some of their favorite treats, broke them in pieces, and placed inside the jug, along with standard kibble. They could smell the food but couldn't quite figure out how to get to it.  I played with them with this toy, with food spilling out erratically, and once in a while, one of their favorite treats spilled out. They have not quite figured out pulling the rope part, but they were rolling the bottle, bouncing it up and down, etc. to get treats out, whatever works. One of my dogs worked for 2 hours last night getting a handful of kibble.  My other dogs are watching, interested, not sure what this thing is, but I believe they will become engaged soon.

review/summary: Use a Plastic Coke Bottle Instead
review/text: So I bought this thing and my cockapoo wouldn't touch it, I played with her with it and tried to show her how it worked and even rubbed cheese on it, but she never figured it out.  So I got the idea that I could take a empty 20 oz coke bottle and fill it half way with kibble and maybe she would graduate to the tug a jug eventually.  Well, she loves the plastic soda bottles, but still ignores this toy.  I think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope.  She loves her rope toys, but doesn't like this rubber rope.  I recommend starting with a soda bottle and only moving to this if they regularly destroy the soda bottle.

review/summary: Wish they hadn't changed this toy
review/text: I originally purchased this item back in March of last year.  It worked out great with my yellow lab in dispensing a meal a day.  This version of the toy had an actual rope coming out of the jug.  After about half a year, the rope wore through, but given the low price of the toy, I was satisfied with 6 months of heavy use and recommended it to friends.<br /><br />I then purchased a replacement end of last year.  Unfortunately, the manufacturers had changed the toy so now it's a rubber rope in place of the original fiber one.  This toy lasted about 15 minutes before my dog had completely chewed through it, making the toy nearly useless.<br /><br />5 stars for the original version, 1 for new and unimproved.

review/summary: Great petsitter!
review/text: If you have a dog labeled "destructive when bored" DO NOT pass up on this toy! It's absolutely the best puppysitter. It's been three months, but when I put her kibble in it I still know that she's good for about 20 minutes while I do dishes or whatever. I hate constantly kenneling her when I need to focus on something, so this has been wonderful because it lets her play so much longer.<br /><br />Pros-<br /><br />- Totally entertains her for a minimum of ten minutes<br /><br />- Can hold her dinner and then some, I can adjust her playtime with how much I put in it. The less I put in it the longer she plays<br /><br />- Easy to load treats in. just unscrew the bottom and you're good!

review/summary: Too much for pup
review/text: I have a lab puppy that is starting to put on too much weight. No surprise there. I thought some search for food toys would work well. I have about three different ones now and a couple more treat toys. He will barely touch this. He loves rubber and the hard plastic seems to bother him. He is smart and can get some of the food out but then gets frustrated and walks off. He is extremely food driven so this was a huge surprise to me. It sits on the floor with food in it and he will just walk by. I have another hard plastic food dispenser that has similar results with him.  He is also an aggressive chewer so I figured he would just chew the rope off. But he doesn't even do that. Know your dogs preferences when purchasing these types of food toys.

review/summary: Good in theory, not in practice
review/text: I got this because everyone says it's great for your dog to play with when he's alone. My dog has several treat dispensing toys to keep him busy: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B11L46">Atomic Treat Ball Interactive Dog Toy, 3-Inch</a> , <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG">Ourpets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball , 5 Inches , Colors may vary</a>, and Kong Puppy Kong Toy Medium. He does really well with all of them, the atomic being his favorite and the Kong coming in a close second because he really has to work to get stuff out of there. The Tug a Jug just does not work at all for him, though. I put tiny treats in there and it is physically impossible for him to get the treats out. If you're lucky, the rope will catch on one of the treats and you might be able to wiggle one out that way, but that would still require him to be holding the jug and tugging the rope which hardly ever happens. If that doesn't work, you have to tip the jug to get anything out and, well, my dog can't do that since he doesn't have thumbs. I'm glad I got this on clearance at CVS otherwise I'd be a little peeved at paying so much for a toy that doesn't work.

review/summary: Great Toy, Impossible to Clean
review/text: Purchased this for my 3 year old Dalmatian who suffers from separation anxiety and boredom when my husband and I leave for work.  We put his breakfast in the Tug-A-Jug, and he went from howling when we left, to happily chasing his toy around to get his food.  He isn't a major chewer, but has ripped things up in the past.  This toy shows some minor scratches (we've had it for about 6 months), but they are all cosmetic-nothing structural.  So that's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news?  The rope gets super smelly.  Since we wanted to use this to feed our dog breakfast, we aren't using the Premier brand treat inserts, we are using just normal kibbles.  After about a month of use, the toy began to smell, so we sent it through the dishwasher.  The only problem is that the rope never fully dries out, and the smell came back quickly, and worse.  Now, if we want it clean, I have to soak it in bleach water, then hand wash, then dish wash, and then put it in the oven on the lowest setting so the rope fully dries out.  For me, this is too much work.  We're ordering a kong to see if we can save on some of the clean up time.

review/summary: Didn't work well for me and my dog
review/text: Based on the stellar reviews, I bought this for my Husky Shepherd dog, Juneau. He would get all the treats out of the KONG so I decided to get him another toy to keep him occupied when I was away. The first few days he attempted to get the treats out of the busy buddy were not successful. He would sniff, push, sniff, push. The hard plastic made a lot of NOISE. Sometimes Juneau would drop the KONG down a flight of stairs to get the treat. I didn't mind the rubber KONG bouncing around. But imagine hard plastic hitting my hardwood and marble floors!<br /><br />After a week of use, I had trouble getting the cap back on. I found myself being the Busy Buddy, trying to get the cap to stay on! We tried to like this product but it just had to go back. I can imagine this toy might be better for those with carpet.

review/text: I bought this for my 6 month old lab puppy. He figured out how to get the treats and it was his favorite entertainment. However, he swung it around from the rope (it's made to do that) and within weeks had broken the plastic top by hitting it against the floor so it could no longer be used. For a $20 item, I expect longer use, and to have plastic shards around a puppy is just dangerous! Great toy/food dspenser in thoery, but just too fragile!

review/text: Well this certainly didn't last long with my german shepard mix puppy.  It less than an hour she had shredded the rope, splitting it into two pieces.  Once the knot in the jug dropped to the bottom she was able to empty all the treats quickly.  I used it again with larger treats inside and no rope.  That worked for about 20 minutes until she ripped the nub coating off the neck of the bottle and started crushing the neck portion.  I had to take it away and toss it, getting only 2 uses and less than 2 hours out of it.

This alone is not a huge deal as the instructions with the toy say that a ball can be placed inside the container and have a similar effect as the rope.

He has other plasic toys that he has had for months with absolutely no signs of damage.

Layla never really chewed on the toy, just picked it up and dropped it, etc.  After about 2 weeks though the screw off bottom developed a crack that eventually split the top. The plastic on the screw off top doesn't seem as thick or sturdy as the rest.  I thought about buying this toy again, but decided to try a treat toy made of rubber which is her new infatuation! If you have a gentle dog and carpet try this toy out, but if you have a large one and hardwood floors maybe think twice!

I felt bad watching her trying to get the treats, and she tried so hard for such a long time. There is no way she would be able to turn it upside down.  It is also SO loud.  We had to take it off her the first day because my husband and I could not hear each other talking!  It was a waste of money. We will stick with Kong dispensers.

review/text: I got the large size for my siberian husky. He sniffed around the treat-filled bottle and turned away. I tried to show him how to get the treats out by pulling the rope, rolling the bottle, etc, he watched me doing it, and still not interested in trying for himself. He didn't even try to bite the bottle. He played with normal water bottles for hours but he just don't think this tug-a-jug is worth any attention. Personally I think it's a great idea how they designed the toy, but I just can't get my dog to play with it. Later I introduced this toy to my coworker, who has a little puggle, and he immediately got one. He puggle chewed up the spiked ball on the bottle neck within 5 minutes...so I guess it's not that durable then.

review/summary: Very easy to destroy!  Not worth the money
review/text: I bought one of these last year for my pittie mix who was less than a year old, he LOVED it at first and had a great time throwing, kicking and rolling it all over the floor to get to the treats.  Then he started holding the jug down with his paws and puling up on the "rope," which didn't take long to tear in half.  I thought maybe he could still use it but that the treat would come out easier, this was not a good idea.  He started chewing on the rubber at the top of the jug and it came apart in pieces - thank goodness he didn't swallow any!  So I figured once again that maybe it would still be useful once I removed the rest of the rubber bits that were torn, again I was wrong.  He started to chew on the top of the jug itself (can't blame him it did smell like treats!) and the plastic quickly became jagged and sharp.  In less than 24 hours this toy was in pieces and in the trash.  It was definitely NOT worth the almost $20 I spent on it!

review/summary: No Fun for Violet
review/text: Our Airedale Violet liked the idea at first. I sat on the floor with her and introduced her to the ins and outs of it. She just couldn't coordinate holding the jug in the correct position while jiggling the rope. She wound up frustrated, barking at the treats which she could clearly see... "they're right there in the bleepin' jug". She spent some time trying to figure out how to open the bottom of the jug. I guess she thought she had a better chance of getting the bottom unscrewed than getting the treats out by holding it at just the right angle with her paw while tugging on the rope. Sorry Vi

review/summary: NOT for tough chewers!!!
review/text: We have a lab who is a TOUGH chewer...this lasted about a week.<br /><br />I got the first one with the rope top, and our dog chewed through the rope in 5 minutes and had the purple ball off in another 10 minutes. I made the mistake of using Gorilla Glue to put it back on, then realized that its really bad for dogs so threw that one away.<br />Ordered another one--this time with the rubber rope--and our dog was through the rope in about 20 minutes, again got the purple ball off in another 10 minutes, and went to work on the neck of the bottle. A week later we had to toss it because he had chewed off the neck of the bottle and it was cracked all down the sides.<br />He did LOVE it while he had it...but $10 for a week of entertainment is a bit much...

review/summary: My dog broke it quickly
review/text: I bought this toy and put one of my dogs in her crate with it.  I just filled it with a handful of kibble.  1/2 hour later the Tug a Jug was broken.  My dog had chewed the end off where it screws on.  Her chewing destroyed the threads so the toy is useless. She's a 55 pound food motivated dog, medium chewer.  My original worry about the Tug a Jug was that it would be noisy on hard floors.  It never made it that far.  I had better luck with the Busy Bone toy, although she can get the Gnawhide rings off pretty quick. At least that one is still usable.

review/summary: Three Dogs...No want...
review/text: I bought this tug toy because of the reviews...However, none of my three dogs had any interest in them, even when I put their favorite snacks in them. I dog is a big chewer, one is a medium chewer, and one is too old to chew! Not one would go near it...Also, it does not look like the picture. It is entirely in purple, and the tug is all purple and rubber... This is the only toy I ever bought that all three dogs disliked. It has been a week, and I keep giving them the toys, but no luck.  I personally think it is too awkward and heavy..Fell on my bare foot, and it hurt somewhat.  I think you could make this with a plastic soda bottle, for nothing...<br />  Sorry for the bad review....The review is from the dogs, and not me!  I paid quite a bit for 2 of them, and I<br />need to figure out what to do with them...paid too much to throw them away.. maybe make a bird feeder?

review/text: My 10 month old Golden Doodle had chewed through the rope within 30 minutes.  The "bottle" part is hard plastic and very loud when bounced around.  The knot on the rope (when we still had a rope) fit too tightly into the opening making getting treats out of the bottle close to impossible.  I had hoped this would be one of those toys to occupy her a bit more.  And for the price, think the rope would have been somewhat tougher to a chewer like mine.<br />If your dog is a chewer I can't recommend this.  Not what I expected or hoped for.....

review/text: I bought this for my 3 month old puppy, thinking it would keep her busy and entertained. It took her about 20 minutes to figure out that she could lay in her bed with the bottle tilted against the side, and the food would keep coming out if she just moved it periodically. I ended up giving the toy away because she was able to be too lazy with it. I gave the toy 4 stars, though, because I doubt this would happen with most dogs. Quite frankly it shocked the heck out of me when I saw what she was doing.

review/summary: Good toy
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:55 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have a 43 pound border collie mix. He needs to be mentally stimulated so I bought this toy for him. He gets his dinner through this jug sometimes.<br /><br />I was nervous about purchasing it because of the reviews stating how the rubber "rope" was easily chopped, but I figured I might be able to replace it with a real rope if it breaks. To my surprise, the purple rope hasn't broke and I had this toy for several months now. My dog has been chewing it with his molars, but not very often. Also he may not be as a strong chewer as the dogs from other reviews.<br /><br />When my dog first recieved this toy, he kept pawing at it and pushing it with his nose panting with exsaustion. It took about an hour until he almost got the one cup of kibble that was in it. Later he got used to it and now he has a strategy. He pushes the back of the bottle straight up. He can empty the bottle in about 10 minutes now.<br /><br />A major problem I have with this toy is that the rubber spikes and the rope gets pretty nasty. It picks up hair from the carpet and dry food crumbs from the kibble inside the bottle and builds up to a disgusting slimy gunk. It is extremely hard to get all the crap out between the spikes and the inner edges of the rope.<br /><br />Over all it is a good toy for my medium sized mutt. It just gets dirty and hard to clean.

review/summary: Keeps her busy for a long time!
review/text: I always use some kind of toy or device to feed my dog, both to make her eat slower and to keep her from getting bored. This is the best toy I've found yet to keep my overly smart dog challenged.<br /><br />I've used Kongs filled with loose kibble, then kibble mixed with yogurt, kibble mixed with cream cheese or peanut butter, then kibble mixed with one of those and frozen. After 2 months of increasingly challenging Kongs, my dog finally graduated to the point that Kongs don't keep her busy or engaged for long. I also had been filling the Premier Waggle with her kibble, and she takes care of those pretty quickly too and seems to have gotten bored of the one repetitive move she used to get food out.<br /><br />So I got the tug-a-jug. My dog figured out how to get food out right away, which was disappointing -- then I realized I could put big chunks of treats in there to make it smell enticing and harder for the smaller food kibbles to come out. It works!<br /><br />I love that you can customize how hard it is for your dog to get food out by putting in objects that are too big to come out. I filled about half the jug with freeze-dried liver. Then, I put about half a cup of kibble per meal. It takes my dog a good half hour to get out all her kibble, and she really seems to love shoving, nosing, and flinging the jug around. She used a greater variety of movements than with the waggle, which is probably more fun for her.<br /><br />I also love that the jug is SO easy to fill! Kongs and even the waggle are annoying because they have small holes you have to shove the treats into, but the entire bottom of the jug screws off so you can just scoop the food in. Fast and easy, and my dog is delighted. Totally worth the $.

review/summary: Better than the Buster Cube; almost as good as a bully stick
review/text: We bought the "small" toy with the rubber rope for our 19 lb mutt who gets very whiny when he's bored. I must say it's the best treat dispensing toy we've given him. It's way less noisy than the Buster Cube and the same amount of treats/kibble lasts longer. Other treat dispensing toys have gotten chewed up quickly and this one hasn't. Benji is an easy keeper and doesn't need much food. If we put his morning ration of 1/4 cup of kibble in the tug-a-jug it takes him about 40 minutes to get it all out and by that time he's panting with exertion.<br /><br />I do *not* recommend this toy for use on bare floors if you are there to supervise as you probably should be. The jug itself is very hard plastic and Benji could care less about manipulating the "rope" to get the treats out: he simply throws the jug around until food comes out. If I were to give him this toy in our kitchen the noise would drive me crazy. On our carpeted living room floor the noise is tolerable.<br /><br />The only distraction that works better is a bully stick which of course is silent but they are expensive and I don't like to use them every day. Alternating them with the tug-a-jug has given us some peace and quiet. Altogether a good investment in our situation.

review/summary: Keeps the pup busy
review/text: This Tug-a-Jug turned out to be the perfect thing for our black lab puppy. We put his evening kibble inside and let him roll it around to get his dinner. The jug keeps him occupied for anywhere between 25 minutes to an hour.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good mental stimulation. Dinner isn't just available to wolf down. It requires some work and is totally worth the reward!<br />2. Sturdy construction. It's held up against the chewy habit of the pup. I do not let him chew on it outside of meal times in order to keep his focus mainly on the food and not the jug.<br />3. The rope seems to be very enjoyable to our pup. He likes to stop and chew on it for a minute before starting to roll and spin the jug again. I'm guessing that has something to do with teething. It's also replaceable (if you can find replacement rope).<br />4. Easy to clean. The bottom screws on/off and the inside can be wiped down.<br />5. Mouth of the jug has a nice texture which helps our pup hold on with his paws. His spin and push control (with his paws) has increased drastically since we started feeding him one meal a day from it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sturdy construction also means it breaks anything fragile in its path. The rope makes it easy to swing around. I would keep the dog and jug away from small pets and children.<br />2. Can't use it with raw food unless you want to make a horrible mess all over the place.<br />3. Loud if you keep it on a linoleum floor like we do. Our pup loves to bang the jug around, spin it with his paws and push it with his nose. It makes quite a racket. It's fairly quiet on the carpet.<br />4. If your dog is really smart, he might figure this one out quickly. I'd recommend pairing this with one of the other Busy Buddy feeding products and switching between them often to keep your dog on his toes.

review/summary: BULLET PROOF? Maybe for rubber bullets...
review/text: I have a 15-lb. schnauzer-mix puppy. She's easily bored, extremely destructive & likes puzzles. This looked perfect. It takes a bit of work to get food out so I knew this would occupy her for a while. The screw-on lid at the bottom of the jug was virtually seamless and very tight. When I ran my fingers over the seam before giving it to her I could barely feel it.<br /><br />I gave it to her at 8am before I went to work. I came home for lunch at 11:30 and she had COMPLETELY destroyed it! She located the seam and, somehow, wedged her teeth into it, worked her way around the circumference and pried the lid loose. She then chewed the lip off of the jug all the way around so the lid cannot be put back on it. She was lying there calmly and the food was all gone, so she had clearly long since finished all this in the 3.5 hours since I had given it to her.

review/summary: Dog won't touch it!
review/text: I have a 7 pound miniature poodle, and she is terrified of this toy. She tugged it a couple of times when we first gave it to her, but it made so much noise she has never messed with it again. I have tried to get her to play with it, but as soon as I get her to tug it, she gets scared. I think she feels like the bottle is following her. Also, we got this in the extra small size, and at the time we purchased it,(2009)it came with an actual rope. The treats are very hard to get out. Even for small treats, I have to push the rope in and tip it upside down and to the sides to get them out effectively. I know that some of the more recent reviews have talked about a rubber rope which might have fixed this problem, so maybe this is an outdated issue. Most of all I would just say this toy is probably not for dogs that have a more timid tendency or are scared of loud sounds.

review/text: This product probably works fine at larger levels but at the small the bottle neck is too narrow to allow anything but crumbs to come through. With this sized rope and the storage available in the bottle the product would work perfectly if it had a larger opening to allow dog to pull out treats. Sadly this is not the case.<br /><br />I'm hesitant to purchase a larger one as I worry the bottle neck-rope width issue will be just as present as it is in the small.

review/summary: My dog now prefers this to the food bowl.
review/text: My dog absolutely loves this toy.  It takes her about 40 minutes to get a cup of kibble from it.  It is great for her mentally and physically.  It has also been a tremendous help to her digestion, as she was a "competive eater" when we adopted her, always wolfing down her food in seconds, and as a result having "intestinal turbulence" with alarming frequency.  The tug a jug forces her to eat slowly.  It took her a while to get the hang of it, so it was a supplement, not a substitute, for her regular meals at first.  But now that she knows how it works, I usually feed her one of her two meals in it each day.  The other day, I actually split her dinner between the food bowl and the tug a jug, and she opted to play with the tug a jug for 25 minutes before going for the "easy meal" in her bowl.  I can't think of a better endorsement than that!  The one drawback is that it breaks down somewhat easily.  We are on our third tug a jug.  Each previous one has lasted about a month before our dog has bent the end the food goes in enough that it can't be closed anymore.  So, we buy three at a time now.  They're not that expensive, and I think they're totally worth it.

review/summary: Waste of money and time
review/text: Worst toy ever!<br />-cheap plastic, not strong<br />-rope too thick prevents treats to fall out<br /><br />I have a super smart border collie and he got frustrated with that thing. Not because it's hard to understand how it works just because it's very hard to get the treats out even for me, even when he shakes it. The rope (too thick)prevents the treats from falling out.. and even when I removed the rope, the shape of the bottle makes it difficult as the kibbles roll inside but that's pretty much it, they barely ever get passed the neck. Which makes it a very expensive useless toy, I could have just use a small empty water bottle for no cost!!<br /><br />DO NOT RECOMMEND!<br />Try the kibble nibble instead, I have one and it's way better even if sometimes the treats fall out of it too easily. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JU18S4">Busy Buddy Kibble Nibble Food and Treat Activity Ball</a>

review/summary: Clever Idea, BUT ....
review/text: The "rope" idea doesn't really work ( well it works 1 time). It actually impedes the dispensing of the treats after your dog yanks it out - now the treats are stuck inside until the human pushes the rope back in.<br /><br />Would NOT purchase again!

review/summary: My puppy doesn't like this...too hard to get treats out
review/text: My small, 6 lb Mini Schnauzer-Shih Tzu mix found this a bit frustrating.  As others have said in the reviews, she couldn't get the treats out...she knew they were in there, but they don't come out easily and I put in her smallest doggie food.  Heck, I couldn't even get them out unless I pulled VERY hard on the rope.  She likes the rope, but not for long...she'd like it better by itself.  I got the smallest one and she's a very smart dog, but it's just not for her.  Don't know what I'm going to do with this thing...just put it in her toy box I guess and hope she latches onto it once in a while.  It's a total waste of money in my opinion.  She likes the roller treat dispensers...I even made one myself with an empty plastic peanut jar, used an exacto knife to cut holes on two sides, and she can roll it around and get excited about her treats rolling out...even an empty butter tub can be used.  Save you money on this one.  Just MHO.<br />Update:  My puppy is now 11 pounds, full grown and will be 1 year soon and STILL cannot get the treats out of this thing.  I even have a hard time getting them out....I have to pull the rope HARD to get anything out.  Then I noticed my pup chewing on it and she was chewing the bottom off and, by the time I noticed what she was doing, she had it off.  She GOT the treats, but I threw the thing away....total waste of money I think.  Not MHO this time....experience!!

review/summary: Good while it lasted ... but it didn't last!
review/text: I started feeding my chocolate lab his dinner in this toy and it worked well.  I really enjoyed watching him figure out how to dump this kibble out and he seemed to enjoying the challenge of getting every last piece out.  He took to picking up the empty jug and dropping it, as if to ask for more food ... and after 3 or 4 instances of this, the lid broke.<br /><br />If the lid were better protected from this type of damage I would definitely buy another one.  It's not dog proof enough for us.

review/text: I have 2 chihuahua's and they are not at all interested in this toy.  I have tried different types of treats in it and they still care less.  Maybe it is a good toy for big dogs in a yard or something?

review/summary: Nice toy but our Vizsla puppy is just not interested
review/text: Another love it or hate it toy.... It's a bottle, it's a spiky ball, it's a rope, it's a treat dispenser! Apparently, the choices are too overwhelming for our Vizsla puppy because she passes this one up. In addition, the hard plastic bottle makes a racket on our hard kitchen floor, so maybe it's a blessing after all :)

review/text: My dog can't seem to figure this one out.  No matter how much he tugs on it, the food doesn't come out.  We prefer the Kong Wobbler.  This was a waste of our money.

review/summary: Plastic Is Not Durable Enough for a Dog Toy
review/text: My dog really likes this toy, and it occupies him for quite a while. The big problem is that the plastic cracks at the top where the lid screws on if it dropped on the floor. My dog is Jack Russell, so he's not dropping it from a very high height, yet it still breaks, so I can't imagine it with a larger dog. We have returned this toy twice, and already the third on is pretty much unusable.

review/summary: Looks like fun, but my dogs ignored it.
review/text: I think the problem with this toy is that the rope fills up too much of the bottle neck which makes getting a treat out of the container nearly impossible.  It is certainly a sturdy product though, but having Boxers I can just imagine one of them grabbing it by the rope and swinging it around, and breaking something in my house.

review/summary: Good concept, brittle plastic
review/text: I bought this toy for my 9 month old lab and had to return this twice. My dog loved it, but he dropping it on our hardwood floors and the bottom twist off part broke with each one. Good concept but plastic too brittle. Company does stand behind it, just not good for my dog.

review/summary: Dogs not interested
review/text: My dog are so uninterested in this that it might as well be invisible.  I even put liver treats in it and tried to show them how to play with it.  Neither dog would bother with it at all. (One is Female 4 yr old greyhound/lab/shephard mix, other is female 4 month old lab/border collie mix - both are very playful & love treats)<br />Very disappointed.

review/summary: Not good at all
review/text: I have a yorkie (4 lbs) so I got the extra small one. Not a single doggie-bite-size treat could come out from where it supposed to, and that was me trying to get the treats out...<br />So, don't bother with this toy, your dog is only gonna drool all over from smelling that toy.

review/summary: Hard Plastic
review/text: This is made out of hard plastic. I bought this for my Shepherd that loves to chew. She's not interested in playing with it at all. It's made to be a educational for dogs,  I guess she just got bored with it. On the plus side your human kiddos will like it.

review/summary: The lid cover broke within 5 minutes
review/text: I thought this dog toy would perfectly fit my 11 month Samoyed and provide the durable playful time. Unfortunately, my Samoyed was not just rolling the bottle, her chewing on the knots caused the bottle to fly around and when it hits my fragile ceramic floor, it broke (both the lid cover and my newly set floor).. *sigh*<br />Maybe this product should be used in a carpeted environment only.
