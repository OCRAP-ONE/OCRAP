review/summary: The same as the Caramel
review/text: I had hoped for more after the caramel but this smells, looks and tastes the same.  I am not a coffee junkie but would like to think I can smell/taste the difference between these two different blends from the same seller.  Not so much.  I'll try another brand next time.  Other reviewers have raved about this blend. Me... not so much.

review/summary: King of the Sumatra Coffees
review/text: Weaver's is not the first Sumatra coffee but it surely is the best out there.  You have to try it to believe it.  Better yet, do what I did --  I gave several bags of the whole bean Sumatra organic to an important client as a corporate gift and, for the first time after receiving a food product, the client raved about how great tasting Weaver's was and then ordered it for their office full time.  They realized that great tasting coffee need not be the exception but can and should be the norm.  The Weaver Sumatra Organic Whole Bean is my favorite of the Weaver line of excellent coffees and teas.  Try it and see for yourself!

review/summary: Smoothie Heaven
review/text: I have tried the 1st three of these:<br />Strawberry Bomb<br />Mango Mania<br />Strawberry Banana<br />Extreme Peach<br />Wildberry Blast<br />Razz-Cranberry<br />Caribbean Colada<br />Intense Green Apple<br />Antiox A.P.B. (Acai, Pomegranate, and Blueberry with Yerba Mat&eacute;)<br />Mandarin Orange/Passion Fruit<br />Kiwi Banana<br /><br />They come in a convenient package which stores and dispenses well. Due to the intense fruit puree, they are very weight-dense compared to the size of the container. My friends and I enjoy putting greens, like stripped celery, spinach, romaine or red leaf, and a bit of shaved carrot, along with half a banana into the blender to add something more. It also makes a quick tea which can be adjusted to your sweetness liking just by adding more or less to the glass as it is made.<br /><br />We have also tried the Soy and Dairy blend beverage bases. Use to creamy up your smoothies or use for coffee as well as recipes which require a sweet half & half type ingredient.<br /><br />The only thing missing is an approved nutritional table. There is no information on calories, sugar content, or other ingredient aspects of the product. The only thing that Jet Tea states is that they are fat and preservative free.<br /><br />Each 64oz container has about 16 to 18 servings, depending upon the size of the drinking container. It is far more economical to buy by the case rather than the individual unit of course.

review/summary: Not their best product, that's for sure
review/text: I'm a *BIG* fan of the Vitalicious VitaTop products ("maximum nutrition for minimum calories")--especially the Deep Chocolate version--so I was eager to try the BlueBran mix.  But I have to say I was disappointed with this product. Don't be fooled by the photo on the box, people! The "blue bran" name is misleading--I found approximately 3 freeze-dried blueberry 'chips' in my batter. You will definitely need to add your own fresh or frozen blueberries to the mix, otherwise you'll just have plain old bran muffins.<br /><br />Even after I added fresh blueberries to my batter, the end product was not very good--it was gooey and bland, with a weird after-taste.  My family usually inhales the Vitalicious products, but these are still in the freezer.<br /><br />I have two boxes of the mix left, so I'm going to try adding chunks of apple to the next batch, along with some cinnamon to give it some flavor, and see if I get a better result.  Bottom line: Skip these and go for the Vitalicious Deep Chocolate mix.

review/summary: Terrific Bran Muffin Mix
review/text: I recently purchased this mix after twice ordering the Vitalicious Deep Chocolate Mix which is heavenly. This mix does not include blueberries which is clearly stated on the package. I added one half pint (more than called for)of fresh blueberries and 1/4 cup of ground flax seed but otherwise prepared the mix according to package directions. I baked them for about 20 minutes at 350 (not 400 as advised on the package) and then performed the "toothpick test." The toothpick came out clean so I removed them from the oven and allowed them to cool for 4 or 5 minutes. They popped out of the muffin pan easily and cleanly. They were moist, flavorful and absolutely delicious.<br /><br />I used the Wilton brand jumbo muffin pans (love these pans) which are also sold on Amazon. Just a touch of spray oil on the pan is all that is needed. This mix makes 6 jumbo muffins or 12 regular. The jumbos are perfect for taking to work for a pick-me-up in the late morning and mid afternoon because you can cut them in half and have plenty for two snacks during the day. They are incredibly filling and will satisfy your sweet tooth as well as provide a protein boost for energy. I like to have them with a cup of Green Tea which adds additional antioxidents to those provided by the blueberries.<br /><br />With this mix I do not recommend using paper baking cups. I used them one time with the Vitalicious chocolate mix and lost a lot of the muffin to the paper. The Wilton muffin pans work beautifully with this mix without any sticking so the baking cups are unnecessary.<br /><br />I freeze these muffins in a zip lock baggie as soon as they have cooled. The frozen jumbos require about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on high in my microwave to reach a perfect temperature. You might want to start with 1 minute and check the muffin for temp as all microwaves heat a bit differently.<br /><br />Preparation time is 30 minutes or less start to finish including baking. You don't need an electric mixer; just stir the ingredients with a fork or spoon and spoon them into the muffin pans. I used to bake bran muffins from scratch but this mix is so much easier, faster, healthier and better tasting that those days are history! This is the best of homemade from a mix. Just don't tell your friends it's a mix because they will never know the difference otherwise.<br /><br />I have also prepared this mix with dried cranberries which also turned out perfectly moist and delicious. I purchased the cranberries from Amazon and they are plump and delicious. We add them to our cereals and salads and eat them out of the bag for snacks. I buy a 4 pound box and freeze them in zip locks.<br /><br />Enjoy your muffins and I suspect your health will improve as well.

review/summary: Delicious Recipe-Modified Muffins
review/text: My first time for Vitalicious muffins, but I've baked a lot of Duncan Hines blueberry muffins and I've learned to be innovative.  Instructions call for 3 egg whites, water and fresh blueberries, but instead I used 3 whole eggs, milk and dried blueberries, and added 1/4 cup of flour to get slightly larger muffins.  (I used the same adjustments on a package of Vitalicious Deep Chocolate.)<br />--- I love the BlueBrans, and my wife loves the Chocos. I freeze one of each in the same sandwich bag, two dozen in all, and we each eat half a slightly-heated muffin at mid-morning. My BlueBrans are superb!

review/text: I ordered blueberry bran muffins, the first ingredient you need to buy is the blueberries.  Why would they call them that if you need to add your own fruit.  You have to separate the yolk from the white for the eggs and they sort of had the consistancy of a tumble weed,  I have two more boxes to use, maybe I will try experimenting  to make them where they rise better and don't need expensive blueberries.

review/summary: good muffins!
review/text: I love this mix. It makes one batch (12 muffins) of fabulous 100-calorie blueberry muffins. The picture on the front of the mix is somewhat misleading, because you DO have to add blueberries (although it does say on the back that you need to add the blueberries yourself). The directions are a snap, and I personally really like the result. The muffins are very high in fiber so I tend to feel stuffed after just three muffins, and don't go on to eat four or five of them. Although if you are so inclined, that's still not too bad at 100 calories per muffin. There are other recipes for the mix at the Vitalicious site.

review/text: Fans of Vitatops know that those babies are not cheap--can be almost 1.50 per muffin. If you buy the muffin mix on super saver shipping, the cost becomes .50c per muffin! Add it up after a few months, you'll be very happy with yourself:)<br /><br />These are so easy to make--I substitute for the egg whites with 3 TBPSs of ground flaxseed, 9TBSPS water, add 1 1/4 cps water to that and poof! in 1/2 an hour they are baked at 400 degrees and fabulous. The directions are on the back, it is really simple.<br />Taste-wise they taste the same as the vitatop--very moist, good flavor and healthy. Not as good as the chocolate ones, but that's my preference:)

review/summary: Taster Tins
review/text: Since I was introduced to finishing salts, I've never been able to go back to plain old table salt. I highly recommend trying a sampler set of salts to see which one(s) you like before buying larger quantities, and it's also nice to have a variety of salts for different tastes and food/uses. Finishing and Gourmet salts are not just for Foodies, but for the average cook as well.  It is fun to try them on different combinations of food. You don't need to worry about getting too much salt in your diet if you omit salt during cooking and add a pinch on fresh, pure, non-processed foods at the table or upon serving.  Not only do finishing salts improve the flavor of so many foods, but they can add to the presentation.<br /><br />A salt sampler makes a great gift, but if gifting, buy the bottles instead of the tins - they would make a much more attractive gift. I got the tins because I needed small and light containers, but you wouldn't want to set them out on the table or keep them anywhere visible.<br /><br />As for this particular sampler and the seller:  It was shipped very quickly, and the quality of salts is fine, however -- it would have been helpful had they indicated the quantity (weight) of salt for the taster tins in the description.  It is indicated for every container, except the tins. (It varies: .6 oz., .9 oz., and 1 oz. depending on the density of each salt).  It would also be helpful if each label was on the top of the tin instead of the bottom so you don't have to turn each one upside down to identify the one you are looking for - unless you are able to see through tin.  The informational brochure that came with them would have been great - IF the type was large enough to read!  I had to use a magnifier and still couldn't read some of it because of the poor quality printing in addition to the tiny size, and I have 20/20 vision.

You just need a tiny sprinkle on top of your food -- a little goes a long way (but that's the point).  My only complaint is that these tins are very difficult to open, and sometimes cause a bit of a spill when they give that final pop.  It would have been nice to have jars instead.

review/summary: Not bad...after I tweaked it a bit.
review/text: I've been looking for a suitable replacement for my all time favorite instant cappuccino; Folgers Cappuccino Mocha Chocolate.  I thought I'd found it in this product.  In fact they are so similar in appearance (even the cans are the same size) I called the company to find out if they were owned by Folgers parent Smuckers.  Nope. Should have tried the product first.  Ok, it's good but is way too latte for my taste and lacks the Mocha component I found so satisfying in the Folgers product.<br /><br />As another reviewer has commented, I find I don't need to use as much and to subdue the overbearing latte component, I add a teaspoon of 'pure' instant coffee.  I know, low tech, but I find the combination almost on par with the Folgers product.<br /><br />I don't think this product is as good as some I've had but with a little tweaking, can be very good.  I've signed up fot the subscription delivery to save money and expect to have some fun playing around with it.

review/text: If you like Mocha Cappuccinos you will love this product.  I like to make it with brewed coffee instead of milk and then add cream.  Real cream, not the phony stuff.  Soooo good!  It serves well as a dessert paired with orange sections and/or strawberries.  I am a coffee addict and have tasted cappuccinos from many different coffee bars.  Some of them are really, really good, I won't mention any specific names here, but Community Coffee Instant Cappuccino rates right up there with the very best.  Try it, I think you will like it.  Oh, and try it for breakfast with buttered toast, or better yet, your favorite scones.

review/text: This mocha is so good I really do only need 2 spoonfuls. It dissolves very well and the chocolate flavor is prominent. I really appreciate how easily the protective seal comes off. The cans are small but if they were much bigger I'd have to lift with both hands. I will definitely buy this coffee again.

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: Love all of Zatarain's products! Yes, if you are on a restricted diet and having to eat reduced sodium products, well... you'd probably shouldn't even be shopping ANY pre-packaged prepared convenience products, as they all tend to be more sodium than allowed on a restricted diet. (930mg of sodium per box for 4 servings here.) Freshly made is probably always going to be best for you.<br /><br />That said, if you don't have those kinds of restrictions and can include convenience boxed products in your diet occasionally, all of Zatarain's products are excellent. This is a turmeric spiced rice that also contains dehydrated onion and bell pepper and other seasonings. I use it in a spicy corn casserole I make and also a couple of shrimp casseroles. Makes a very quick, easy, and delicious meal.

review/summary: Not so much.....
review/text: I like strong flavored coffee, and only occasionally roast coffees.  I brew in the little Bodum 17 oz (makes 250 cc) French Press using boiling water and a 4-minute cycle time. I use about 5 level scoops of fresh ground coffee per batch.<br /><br /> I found this brew to be weak on flavor, and very often bitter. With a halved cycle time, the bitterness doesn't disappear.<br /><br /> I love the smell of fresh coffee brewing in any time of day. I seldom find any aroma during brewing or tasting this coffee, and only occasionally when the beans were ground.<br /><br /> One more observation - the ground beans hold considerable amounts of air. When wet with boiling water, most of the air is liberated - producing a three-phase foam: air, liquid, and solid ground coffee. If allowed to stand, half of the contents of the filled French Press container will be this foam. Slowly it will lose air and evaporated water, becoming a solid matrix! So I continually stir the contents of the container for at least half of the brew time until nearly all the air has been liberated and the foam has been "beaten down." Then I can add the other half of the water - filling the container. The result appears as does Guinness Stout - dark liquor with a little aerated foam on top. OK!. Without the stirring, the water-soluble oils in nearly all the ground beans are extracted into maybe half of the liquid - not the uniform and consistent brewing environment I was hoping to obtain. THEN, when the brew cycle is complete, I find that the grounds are so swollen with liquid that they don't easily liberate brewed coffee liquor as the filter element is depressed. You have to force the thing downward and hot coffee spouts from the top of the French Press container. Odd..... as I don't find this in any other bean coffee product.<br /><br /> Just to check my senses, I bought a � pound of hazelnut from my local supermarket. It has both taste and aroma, but isn't cheap....

review/summary: Taster Tins
review/text: Since I was introduced to finishing salts, I've never been able to go back to plain old table salt. I highly recommend trying a sampler set of salts to see which one(s) you like before buying larger quantities, and it's also nice to have a variety of salts for different tastes and food/uses. Finishing and Gourmet salts are not just for Foodies, but for the average cook as well.  It is fun to try them on different combinations of food. You don't need to worry about getting too much salt in your diet if you omit salt during cooking and add a pinch on fresh, pure, non-processed foods at the table or upon serving.  Not only do finishing salts improve the flavor of so many foods, but they can add to the presentation.<br /><br />A salt sampler makes a great gift, but if gifting, buy the bottles instead of the tins - they would make a much more attractive gift. I got the tins because I needed small and light containers, but you wouldn't want to set them out on the table or keep them anywhere visible.<br /><br />As for this particular sampler and the seller:  It was shipped very quickly, and the quality of salts is fine, however -- it would have been helpful had they indicated the quantity (weight) of salt for the taster tins in the description.  It is indicated for every container, except the tins. (It varies: .6 oz., .9 oz., and 1 oz. depending on the density of each salt).  It would also be helpful if each label was on the top of the tin instead of the bottom so you don't have to turn each one upside down to identify the one you are looking for - unless you are able to see through tin.  The informational brochure that came with them would have been great - IF the type was large enough to read!  I had to use a magnifier and still couldn't read some of it because of the poor quality printing in addition to the tiny size, and I have 20/20 vision.

review/summary: Great gift for a great cook
review/text: I got these as a gift for my husband and he loves them, as does everyone who has joined us for a meal lately. The salts are potent. You need very little to get an amazing tasting meal together. The starter set includes enough diversity of salts that you have enough to use on many different foods (fish, meats, rice, etc) before you invest in a larger set or more tins.

review/summary: Great, but one broken
review/text: Everything about this was as I was hoping except that, like another reviewer, one of the glass jars arrived broken and there were shards and salt in the package.  I'm not returning it because it was for a last-minute gift - but if you're buying it I'd recommend getting the metal tins.  Less expensive and less breakable, too.<br /><br />Aside from the breakage, everything seems great.  I tasted one of the salts from the broken bottle (risky, I know, given the broken glass), and I have to say it was delicious.

review/summary: this food saved my dog
review/text: I use California Natural Lamb & Rice for my 10 year old shepherd Terrier mix. She has a very sensitive stomach and after years of trying numerous different brands this one finally made a difference. It's all natural and only has three ingredients: lamb meal, rice, and sunflower oil so how could you go wrong. With other foods my dog used to have soft stools and vomit frequently but that rarely happens anymore. When it does, I give her California Natural canned food (any variety) and that seems to help even better than the dry. However, I stick with the dry because it's cheaper and better for her teeth. I have a lot of faith in this food and highly recommend it for any dog.

review/summary: My small dogs gobble this up.
review/text: I had to switch food from Merricks to California Natural because after two years of feeding my dogs Merricks food, it seems like they are having problems with their pancreas. The food may be a little too oily. After feeding them California Natural for the first time, they loved it. They finish all their food every meal. Too bad they dont make the small bites in chicken and rice formula. I have three 15 to 20lb dogs, so the small bites makes it easy for them to chew.

review/summary: Parent company Natura sold to P&G in June 2010.
review/text: My dog has been on this food for 6 years now and is doing very well on it.  There has been no vomiting, and she produces very solid and small poops once a day.  She has a very sensitive stomach and seems to not be tolerant of overly rich foods including the canned version of this kibble.  Other brands we've tried are Solid Gold, Wellness and Wellness Core.  Solid Gold (the pink bag with the Westie on it) was okay for about a few months, then she started having soft poops again.  Wellness and Wellness Core turned her into a doggie fountain.<br /><br />The only downside to this is that she isn't very excited about it.  This is probably the simplest diet there is consisting of 1 protein (lamb) and one starch (rice) plus some oils.<br /><br />I found that the addition of salmon oil or Vet prescribed Probiotics (mixed with warm water to form a gravy) helps keep her interested in her food.<br /><br />An important note is that as of June 2010, California natural's parent company Natura was purchased by P&G who has a track record of turning good brands into bad brands in the name of profit.  I am hoping that Natura's brands (Evo, California Naturals, Innova, etc) do not follow in the foot steps of Eukanuba.  Just a note to watch out for anything unusual since this is meant to be the simplest food on the market today.

review/text: I bought this food for my two yorkshire terriers because of the limited ingredients and because I know it's high quality. However, they will NOT eat this food and I've tried all the tricks (hiding it, mixing with yogurt or wet food, mixing it with their other dry food, etc.)  They eat around it and spit it out. I guess they just really don't like the lamb taste. Also, it smells pretty bad. I will have to try a chicken based food next time.

review/summary: Terrific Kimchi
review/text: I have a hard time finding good Kimchi. Taking time out of my busy day to find Asian Groceries that carry it and find out if their product is decent is a hassle. I discovered Mama Eun's kimchi on Amazon. com and love it. It's not cheap but it's excellent Kimchi. They ship it FEDEX next day on cold packs so it gets to your door safe and sound and refrigerated. Someone from the company called right after I received the delivery to make sure it had arrived safe and was still cold! I'm going to try their Bulgogi next! If you don't mind paying for it, their product is excellent.

review/summary: Very good kimchi, satisfies my craving
review/text: I've been looking everywhere for decent kimchi, but the only products I can find in the stores nearby are so terrible I seldom feel inclined to buy any. This kimchi tastes good and satisfies my craving. I was completely satisfied with my purchase.<br />My order arrived very quickly, in just a couple days, even though it was the week before Christmas. Regarding the shipping costs, which some reviews had mentioned, they can be minimized by ordering multiple units together; you can have 4 shipped for the same shipping cost as 1. I have also read in other reviews that this kimchi is not very spicy but, to me, it seems about what I would expect. It has the normal amount of chili and the amounts of other spices vary. Regarding the packaging, the plastic bags used are a convenient size for shippment and storage but are not resealable; you will need to repackage whatever you don't use immediately from each bag you open.<br />I just hope this product remains available; I would like to keep some around for snacking or adding to meals.

review/summary: Kimchi Lover!
review/text: This is the best kimchi I have ever purchased on-line. Of course, it is not as good as my mom's kimchi but it is very close. Being half Korean, a former military kid and a kimchi eater since I was 2 years old (I have pictures!), I have to say that this kimchi is very, very good. The only downside is the portions. The bag is small. Only enough for, maybe, three servings but if you don't have ready access to kimchi (my mom is 75 years old with arthritis in both hands) then try this kimchi. The package arrived quickly and was packed well. Also, please remember that food, like beauty, is in the eye/palate of the beholder/taster. What tastes good to you may not to someone else. I have to go, I am ordering two more bags of kimchi right now.

review/text: I read the reviews before purchasing this product and I have to say I was disappointed.  I acquired a taste for kimchi while I was living outside of DC and have not found any suitable since I left.  I live in a rural area and most people do not know what the word is let alone have a place to buy it.  I was really looking forward to this shipments arrival.  Well it arrived yesterday and of course I had some for dinner.  I will say it was well packed and arrived in a timely fashion but other than that I was truly disappointed not at all what I was looking for.  We all have our own tastes so others seem to like this; it is worth a try if you are jonesing like I have been for a good kimchi fix - I hope you have better luck than I did.  I a giving the item 2 stars because it was well packaged and arrived in a time manner.

We make paella a fair amount, and using real bomba rice really makes a difference.  I've started ordering it from Amazon to avoid having to drive around to several stores to find it.  You use less than you would think because it's so absorbent, so it's a better bargain than it appears.  If you want to make authentic paella, go with bomba rice.

I'm convinced that whatever your favorite flavor of coffee may be, this company will deliver the flavor, richness, creaminess, and robustness of the coffee that you desire. In my humble opinion, any coffee from this company is WELL-WORTH THE MONEY.  It is now my absolute favorite.

In addition, the "flour" is a strange clay color.<br /><br />I was really disappointed, and could barely eat the cookies. No one else would even touch them.<br /><br />The Betty Crocker mix, on the other hand, is delicious, and I can't make cookies fast enough for everyone.<br /><br />One other thing -- don't be fooled like I was -- the Gluten-Free Pantry mix does *not* come with chocolate chips.

review/text: I bought these because we had great luck with another brand of gluten-free cookies and thought these were worth a try also.  They were TERRIBLE, so bad in fact that nobody would eat them.  I contacted Amazon and they graciously refunded me.  I will stick with the original brand from now on, even if these are less expensive.

review/summary: Good for the price of $1.49
review/text: I managed to find a box at the Frys Grocer for only $1.29. They are usually $5.99. I wanted to try them to see how they compared to my regular choco chip cookies. These were easy to make. I over did it on the butter and didnt realize it till just now. But they are good anyway. Kinda crispy, and I like that. Much better then the under cooker doughie ones at the mall. I would buy them again, if on sale. but I dont think i would pay $5.99 for the mix. But I did nt make the cake. So who knows.
