review/summary: Minced is the best
review/text: Garlic comes in many forms: powdered, granulated, minced, whole, etc.  When it come to spices, it's all about surface area and minced has the least resulting in a product that lasts longer on the shelf.  As far as the oil coated minced and whole garlic in the supermarket goes, they have been identified as a source of lysteria according to the CDC.  In my opinion, if you don't have fresh garlic this is the next best thing.

review/summary: Nantucket Rub is overpriced
review/text: The quantity of product in the tin is risibly small for the price.  The rub mixture is loosely packed, and there is about enough in each tin for two, or at most three, sides of salmon.  True, the description of the product gave the weight of the contents, so there was no actual misrepresentation, but there was no picture of an open can to give a clear idea of how little product one would actually get for the purchase.  I'd never order this product again.

review/summary: GREAT COOKIES IF THEY ARE FRESH!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005XOQZC">Nabisco Snack Wells Creme Sandwich Cookies 1.7 oz. (Pack of 12) 20.4 oz. net</a><br />I purchased these cookies in the store several times and thought they were a great alternative to other indulgences.  When I saw them on Amazon, I thought it would be a super savings.  However, these cookies must be fresh, or they are simply not worth eating.  The photo above is a very good sample of some very old and dried out cookies.  When they were received in fresh condition, they were excellent, with soft moist cake and marshmallow and a chocolate coating that was a solid, shiney dark brown.  In this photo above you can see a very dried out product with an old and  pale, discolored coating.  I ordered 3 seperate times, 1st box was "great"  other two were not even edible.  1 FOR 3 MAKES THEM A VERY POOR VALUE.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005XOQZC">Nabisco Snack Wells Creme Sandwich Cookies 1.7 oz.

review/summary: Thank Goodness For These Little Tasty Snacks
review/text: I could eat a devils food cake a day. . .but then, I'd be so big I would require my own zip code.  So I'm darn glad the folks at Nabisco came up with SNACKWELL'S DEVILS FOOD COOKIES.  These are the real deal:  a little devils food cake, surrounded by a marshmellow layer, covered in chocolate.  Zero fat, zero cholesterol, only 50 calories--but this little snack sure doesn't taste like no fat/no cholesterol.  It tastes like sheer indulgence, and that's always a good thing.<br /><br />So I always keep a box around when the sweet tooth starts to take over and I'm needing some guilt-free pleasure.  SNACKWELL'S DEVILS FOOD COOKIES.  Devilishly good.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

review/summary: Loaded with sugars and contains undeclared fats; not a health food
review/text: People, learn how to read nutrition labels. Servings are typically divided into just one or two cookies. Two cookies contain about 100 calories, 24 g carbohydrates and 14 g sugars. The calorie breakdown is over 90% carbohydrates, mostly from sugars. This is a BIG red flag. No one should consume junk like this. Don't be misled by the "Fat Free" label. (see second paragraph) Refined sugars are far, far worse for dieters than fats are; poly- and monounsaturated fats are in fact beneficial, and calories from fat provide more stable energy. With the exception of trans and saturated fats, (they raise bad cholesterol) you really shouldn't be on a low-fat diet. Sugars are the worst thing for dieters, as they aren't as likely to be metabolized as energy, and will typically be stored as body fat. (mostly around the mid-section) High-fructose corn syrup (an ingredient in SnackWell's products) is specifically linked with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. The human body simply is not meant to metabolize this much sugar, nor sugars that are unnaturally processed. I can't provide links to research on the subject, because Amazon has rather ridiculous policies that censor URLs, names of other sites, stores, competitors, etc. from reviews. Be sure to complain to Amazon.com about this practice. Still, it's easy enough to open a search engine and type "snackwell devil food nutrition facts" or the like.<br /><br />Bear in mind that products are not required to declare nutritional content when the servings are divided into small portions, and the content would be less than 0.5 g. Each cookie actually contains 0.17 g saturated fat, which Nabisco neglects to mention. Trans fat content is entirely unaccounted for, though it may actually exist. This means that "Fat Free" claim was just a blatant lie. Will anyone hold Nabisco responsible for unscrupulously deceiving consumers, though? Can anyone demand that they pull misleading products off the shelf? Nope. Welcome to corporate America.<br /><br />Don't let Nabisco and other "health-conscience" snack companies scam you. Read labels closely, and be suspicious of small servings. If a single serving contains less than 0.5 g trans fat, then it doesn't have to be declared; the label will inaccurately specify 0 g. If the portions seem ridiculously small, then it's safe to assume they're trying to hide something from the consumer.<br /><br />On a side note, please ignore "helpful review" ratings. Re-distributors of products will often vote down critical reviews, because they demote the very products they're trying to sell on Amazon. It's all politics.

review/summary: A good deal?
review/text: I love these cookies, generally, and the price is great here on Amazon, but sometimes I question where they come from.  In March, I received a shipment (TWELVE boxes) with an expiration date of 12 March 2011.  I thought that was kinda "iffy", and the cookies were a bit worn (they had that patina of old chocolate), but they were edible, so, okay.  In April, the expiration date was sometime in the far future (September or October of 2011), so I figured the March shipment was a fluke.  In May, the expiration date was *again* 12 March 2011!!  They were PAST expiration.<br /><br />Of course, I'm a carb freak so that didn't stop me from eating them, but, C'MON!!  I'm almost scared to get my next shipment.

At one time FD had duplicated Nabisco's packaging, now its in a green and white box. These Devil's Food cookies cost $1.00 as oppposed to N's supermarket prices of close to $4.00 if not on sale. They are probably made in the the same factory. Plus they have a money back guarantee.

review/text: I think that these cookies are a great deal through Amazon, because the packages are the exact same size and count as the ones sold at our hospital, where we spend far too much time. I'd suggest this bulk purchase to anybody who wants to break free of the $1.25 to $1.75 per pack that a vending machine or the cafeteria will wring out of you...even a convenience store gets right around that same amount, too, so again, just about the best price I can find!!!! =)

review/text: I remember seeing these cookies and imagining how nasty they must taste. I tempted myself into trying some and was quite delighted. Granted, they are not the best cookies (that title belongs to Keebler's Soft Batch) but they are certainly an excellent substitute for those who like to eat cookies and not worry too much about weight. They're quite expensive at the stores (between $3.5-4.5 a box) so I ordered them in bulk from Amazon which bought per box cost down to $2.50.

review/summary: Not a ringer for Nabisco!
review/text: I can't speak for anyone else, but I am most definitely not a spokesperson for Nabisco!  I love these cookies.  They are super yummy,not too sweet, not too "blah."  They do not taste like a "diet" cookie.  I like these as well, probably better, than your normal, everyday "who cares about weight" cookie.<br /><br />I will say this.  I am not a fan of marshmallow.  I don't like marshmallow peeps, marshmallow in cookies, marshmallow "moon pies," any of that. I DO however, like the marshmallow in these cookies.  So that said, it means the marshmallow in the Snackwells is very different than what you find in the above-mentioned snack/sweets.  Therefore if you do like the peeps, moonpies, etc., you may or may not like the Snackwells.  However, the marshmallow is such a small part of this cookie, I don't think it will matter.  The star of this show is the fudgy chocolate.<br /><br />For the person who felt the cookies were bad, I wonder if there could have been a small hole in the packaging and they were, in fact, stale.  I don't typically have any sitting around long enough to go stale, but when I do, they do lose their positive attributes!<br /><br />I think my only "complaint" about this cookie is the fact they are so good, I end up eating too many, taking away any advantage of the fewer calories they contain.

The flavor profile is earthy, woodsy and smoky, very complex and dense and rich while being extremely smooth and without any bitterness to it at all. The ulitmate for a true coffee lover. The platinum is wonderful too... It's a more delicate coffee but still with the rich smoothness that I have come to expect from this producer. I must try their espresso next....The presentation of the Diamond in the black silk bag is extraordinary as well. I have sent these to my clients for the holidays this year.

review/text: My husband bought me my first pouch of this tea as a gift. He knows how much I love vanilla and similarly flavored teas. He's always buying something new for me to try.<br /><br />Over the course of the last three years he's bought me every variation of vanilla tea that he could find. Teas ranging from local tea shops to English and Australian teas. I have to say that this one is my favorite!<br /><br />Tea has a good vanilla flavor, while not being overly done. Some of the ones I've tried have tasted like they've just added cheap vanilla syrup to the leaves before drying. It is flavorful with a quick brew (1-2 minutes) or a longer brew (5+), but 3-4 minutes is a little bitter to me. I use an Adagio (http://www.amazon.com/Adagio-Teas-16-Ounce-Ingenuitea-Teapot/dp/B000FPN8TK) tea brewer, and I am able to use the same leaves for two brews without compromising the flavor (quick initial brew, longer brew on the second).<br /><br />All in all a wonderful tea. You can't go wrong with this one!

I must tell you that I was a bit leery of ordering such a product but as she pointed out the price is certainly attractive (even with the shipping), as these cost a fortune at our local stores.<br /><br />Anyway, she was nice enough to share with us and I must say that I am quite impressed with this product.  The nuts are not salted, which due to dietary/health considerations on my part is almost a must.  These shelled pistachios are ideal for cooking (my wife uses them in her baking, and I constantly snack on them.  We found the flavor to be extremely fresh and as a matter of fact much fresher that of those  purchased locally.  As another reviewer has pointed out, these freeze quite well and the quality is not lessened when done correctly in nice sealed containers.<br /><br />These nuts are on the large size and after close examination we found only one or two that we had to cull from the bunch.  Shipping was quite fast and the order, for my daughter, went quite well with no problems what so ever.<br /><br />We will be ordering these ourselves when the time comes and I do highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: What A Great Buy!
review/text: I worried about ordering such a large amount, but the savings were so good per pound I took the risk. I was able to share some with family and we enjoyed the rest. Some of them are frozen and we pull a little out as needed. They freeze great. Nuts are fresh enough. I am pleased with my order.

review/summary: Very good shelled Pistachios.
review/text: This is my first time to try these unsalted shelled Pistachios for my low salt diet. They taste very fresh and good when they arrived. I put most of them in multiple layered smaller and zipped sandwich bags and keep them in freezer for later use each time. I was very pleased they are still tasty and still pretty fresh, just like before they went into the freezer. Very good product and reasonably priced comparing with the local store prices.

review/summary: Made my dog sick; $400 vet bill.
review/text: I bought these for my 3 month-old lab. I also bought some other treats (dehydrated liver, Kong biscuits, bully sticks). 1-2 days after feeding these to my lab she got violently ill -- vomiting and diarrhea. Took her to the vet and after an overnight stay and IV fluids, the vet had no idea what it was. They decided to x-ray her to see if something was blocking her intestines. Nothing. After antibiotics and rest she was back to her normal high energetic self. I gave her more of these sweet potato fries about a week after her first sickness episode.... and 24 hrs later she was vomiting again.  I was worried, but figured that it must be something I was feeding her. I then examined the package and saw these are made in China.  I threw them out and my puppy has been fine since. Logic points to these treats.... I will no longer buy food items for my dog from China. Nobody else has posted anything about ill reactions to these treats, but search around, lots of dog treats from China are making our dogs sick.

review/summary: My dog loves these!
review/text: I got a dog from the SPCA a few months ago, and learned that in addition to being slightly overweight, he also requires a grain-free diet due to allergies. He also can't have chicken and a few other things, which makes it hard to find treats I can give him. My vet suggested these, since she gives them to her own dogs. My little guy loves them! They're also low calorie, so I can provide them liberally without worrying. I have since shared some with friends, and their dogs love them, too. I have seen these in my local pet shop for a few dollars more, so I think the price is good. I've gone through a couple of containers by now and my dog still comes running for them when I say "treat!". Highly recommend these.

review/text: I used to buy these from Amazon at least 2-3 times a month.  The last 2 shipments were hard as a rock and the potatoes looked like plastic.  I definitely did not give these to my shih tzu. The treats used to be softer and you could tear them into smaller pieces.  The last ones I received I couldn't even cut with a knife.  I won't be buying these any more until I start seeing some positive reveiws.

It seems that every couple of months in the news, there is a new set of canine deaths being reported by owners who fed their dog(s) food or treats manufactured in China.  It is really scary.<br /><br />My dog is like family to me.  I'm not going to risk his life or a huge vet bill to save a buck or two on food made in China by a culture of people that lace toys they sell us with lead and other harmful chemicals.

review/summary: My 7 dogs LOVE them!
review/text: After reading the negative review about the person's dog getting ill from these, I had to add my own 2 cents.  Like that person, I never buy anything made outside of the US for my dogs.  Until I bought these, on accident.  I can sympathize with his dog getting ill -- but I have 7 dogs and they all love these and have never gotten sick.  I keep the jar (love that it's a jar) by the door as a potty treat reward.  They love them.  I have all different breeds and sizes.  Even a bulldog with a sensitive tummy.  She has no problem with these.  These are the only treats I will buy from another country.  They're healthy, low calorie and my dogs will come inside from way back in the yard for these!<br /><br />Update 11/28/11:  Ordered my third jar of these and they were hard as a rock.  Not fresh and pliable as the first two jars.  Contacted Amazon CS, who wanted me to return them for credit.  Too much of a hassle...I tossed them.  Not buying these anymore.  Switching to another brand. Freshness date was many months away so it wasn't a rotate stock issue.  Changed my star rating from 5 stars to 1 star.

review/summary: If theyre Hard, Try this
review/text: i'm noticing some people complaining that in recent times the sweet potato treets are coming "hard as a rock"...i too have gotten them that way and frankly don't understand why one shipment can be perfect while another can be so "off", but Ive figured out a way i can still give them to my dogs and they can still enjoy them and they don't go to waste (frankly they're too expensive to) ... have 2 dogs, so i usually give them 2-3 sticks each per serving. i take them put them in a small bowl put enough water in the bowl so they are floating and then microwave them for exactly 22 seconds, then let them sit for about a minute, afterward i swirl them around in the bowl , them drain out the hot water and then put some cold water in the bowl to cool them down, drain again, dry them a little on a paper towel and then give them to the dogs...they actually like them better this way, they're still chewy but warm and softer. You might give it a try.

review/summary: Not as flavorful as the Honeydew ...
review/text: My first try at Caffe D'Vita was the coffee flavor from Costco.  Been drinking it for years so when I saw the fruit flavors I decided to try them.  My first order was for the Honeydew.  It has a bold taste of honeydew in the 3T measure to 20oz of ice and water in a thermos.  I decided to try the Mango next.  Although I'm not sorry I bought it, it isn't as strongly flavored as the honeydew, it also leaves a LOT of particles coating the sides and lid of my thermos that is hard to remove.  If you wash your glass right after drinking it, it should be fine.  Although the flavor isn't 'screaming' mango (it's more like whispering it), I have started to add a bit of mango puree to my drinks to get a bolder flavor.  Caffe D'Vita kind of missed the mark with this one.  It does make a cool and refreshing drink though.

review/summary: First rate salsa from a can???  Yes, El Pato delivers!
review/text: The first time I bought this salsa I bought it as a joke, mainly for the mallard drake on the label.  But, Wow!  El Pato has a very smoky, medium hot, tangy, salty flavor.  I have given El Pato to visiting friends returning to places without access to the lovely salsa.  Great with chips, but even better on eggs in the morning.  (We who grew up in the Southwest ate hot sauce with our breakfasts of mother's milk!)  My only reservation, and it is really not a reservation, is that the salsa is inconsistent.  Differing levels of saltiness should not happen, as it occasionally is too salty, but differing levels of 'heat' are due to the fickle nature of the jalapeno pepper.  I have had cans that are toward the direction of mild, and one that nearly blew my head off.  Needless to say I have never opened a can of El Pato without finishing it!

review/text: I have been using this brand of Ginseng/royal jelly for several months, both when I need an energy boost and in my morning smoothies.<br />It has a pleasant flavor, compared to pure Ginseng, and I love the way it perks me up without caffeine.<br />The price on Amazon is lower than anywhere I have found and I get it quickly.

review/text: This is one of my favorite coffee additions. Starts the day off well.  So I was very sad when I got the box, not properly packed in the outer box. Eight of 30 vials were broken and unusalble.  The spill of sticky liquid was fortunately contained in the product plastic wrap. Just another week of not feelling as good as I'd like.

review/summary: Crisp, Cool, and Totally Hydrating
review/text: Solixir is my new favorite beverage! Each can of solixir is packed with >1,400mg of botanical extracts designed to serve a functional purpose. The light botanical blend is the perfect balance between juice and sparkling water. There is no added sugar. It's all natural. The Orange Mate, also called "Awaken", is the ultimate beverage for maintaining good hydration and a healthy balance without consuming added sugar and artificial ingredients. It is not a traditional energy drink. It has less caffeine than a cup of decaf coffee. The natural caffeine is from the botanical extracts. No jittery feelings and post-buzz crash as with the traditional energy drink. Just smooth, steady natural energy. Also check out the Blackberry Chamomile "Relax" and the Pomegranate Ginger "Awaken" for a well-rounded selection of functional, healthy beverages.

review/text: I ordered two dozens of Stacy's pita chips, which came in two separate boxes.  Both boxes were open and some of the contents were missing.  I have no way of telling who's to blame for the missing contents, however, I would think that the company could have used a more secure packaging instead of the easy-tear boxes.  It would also have been better to either double box the items or use a plain brown box to discourage stealing while items are being delivered.

review/summary: Potato Pearls Rock
review/text: I have never like instant potatoes. When my sister-in-law tried to get us to buy some with her (quantity order) I staunchly rejected the offer. Who was she to even insinuate that dehydrated potatoes could take the place of freshly whipped potatoes on our dinner table? Can you believe the nerve?  I was tricked into trying these a few months later at her house for a holiday dinner. I say tricked because no-one told me they were instant before I dug in. It never even crossed my mind that someone wouldn't make home-made mashed potatoes for a Thanksgiving dinner!<br /><br />Well, I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. I won't say these are better than fresh whipped potatoes, but I will say that potato pearls are very good. We use them for day-to-day meals and only make freshly whipped potatos for holiday dinners or dinners with a lot of people. It is just too easy to make the pearls and get exactly how much you want in the time it takes to boil water. The taste is great and they don't have that institutional aftertaste that you get when digging in at a buffet or cafeteria.<br /><br />A great example of how versatile and easy these are: I didn't want the pasta my wife made with dinner last night so I put 6 tablespoons of water in the microve and brought it to a boil in 45 seconds. I then added 3 tablespoons of potato pearls and viola! I had the perfect single-serving of mashed potatoes in less than a minute. Another example is my granddaughter (19 months) loves potatoes and we will make some of these up with almost every meal. The fact that you just make them using the easy-to-remember 2-parts-water to 1-part-pearls methodology means you can make exactly the quantity you need. If she doesn't want to eat her vegetables, they get mixed in and she wolfs them down.<br /><br />Honestly, you can't go wrong with these. I don't know if these have an extensive shelf life for you doomsday preppers, but if you have a well stocked pantry and also store emergency rations to a reasonable extent, then just make sure you rotate your supply of the potatoes. But hey, if you keep emergency rations, you probably already know about rotation...<br /><br />Happy tater eating to you!

review/summary: Excel-ent Is Right!
review/text: A long time ago (early 90's) I first found these at Sam's Club. Then, it was no longer reasonable for me to continue membership, so I missed them for a lot of years. After that, I worked for a Personal Care Home and was able to get some again. That was 6 years ago. Now, finally, we meet again, and I can rest assured that I will always have descent mashed potatoes quickly at my fingertips.<br /><br />I tried others when I didn't have Potato Pearls. They are not as good. Especially the ones that begin with I and end with oan. You can't have those as leftovers. They always turned out runny the second day, with only warming them up and not adding anything.<br /><br />Now these, these Potato Pearls, they're the bee's knees of instant mashed potatoes. I hate calling them instant mashed potatoes, I feel like it cheapens them. They are just mashed potatoes. They are so good in flavor, texture, and ease of making them, I want to tell everybody. You can't go wrong with these. They're worth it.

The Potato Pearls are the closest to the real thing I have ever found. I very seldom ever feel the need to expend my energy anymore, in order to fix the "real thing". These are great tasting, as well as fast and easy.

review/summary: Very interesting flavors for candy, makes a great addition to the corner of your desk.
review/text: This box comes with a copious amount of candy with an abundance of flavors.  I personally don't like sour drops/lollipops so I didn't particularly like this set.  Most (maybe 9/12 pouches) have citrus or sour flavored candy that comes in assortments like Mango Tango, Watermelon, and Pomegranate Pucker.  So as such, I brought in the candies in a basket to the corner of my office desk and everyone drops on by to tell me how delicious they are.  It's relatively cheap so if you're working in an administrative position, this purchase might be an easy way to spark up conversations or get noticed around the office.  My personal favorites were Pomegranate and Root Beer.  If you're thinking of getting this candy for yourself, it is WAY too much for any ordinary sweet-toothed person to eat.  You WILL have to share or give them to family or friends.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Great drop/lollipop pack for the price with very interesting (and unforgettable) flavors.  If you buy this particular box, you will have to share or give away various pouches unless you want to develop cavities.<br /><br />NOTE THAT THESE CANDIES ARE NOT SUGAR FREE, they are ONLY GLUTEN FREE for people with various disorders.  They are still very sweet (and sour).

review/text: I ordered this variety pack to try candy made with natural flavors, and so far everything I have tried I love.  The peppermints are strong and wonderful, and the Root beer candies are great.  (Edit because I have tried more of the variety)  So far I have not come across a flavor I did not enjoy, even ones I was not sure about (pomagranet pucker?)turned out to be wonderful treats.  I do limit myself on how many I eat, but I find the serving size is more than enough to satisfy an occasional attack of the sweet tooth.  So far the peppermints and the Vitamin C citrus drops are my favorites.  I wish some of the flavors came in drops without the variety pack, or a creat your own variety, as I can have hard candy but cannot walk around with a sucker stick hanging out of my mouth at work.

review/summary: Got sweets for Xmas now!I
review/text: I discovered YummyEarth in a Deal of the Day, and was immediately taken with the good tasting candies. So I decided to "branch out" from the lollipops, and taste their various treats. I got a big box with 12 different sorts of candies in, and most of them are really yummy. However, like in any variety pack, there are some you like and some you don't. That's why it's only 4 stars, and not 5. I have, however, figured out what to do with the candy, I will make nice little boxes and cones in bright colour and make presents of the ones I don't particularly like. I would say only 2-3 of the bags wasn't to my liking, the rest is just as yummy as I had hoped for.<br /><br />I really like the real taste of the candy. There is no artificial flavour, it's all got clean real taste. I loved the mint ones, and of course the strawberries (I ordered a big bag of those... I will have candy for years!), did not care so much for the spicey ones, nor the root beer one. But that's just me, I think, I don't drink root beer either :)<br /><br />I am glad I got these, though, it's always nice to have some candy in a bowl for visitors, and the fact that the taste is real, and no artificial anything in them, makes me very happy. Definitely recommend these!

review/text: I ordered the sampler pack and totally loved all of them.  I found that when my stomach was upset, they help settle it. There were no after tastes at all. They all tasted very good and when I was craving something sugary or sweet, I would take of these and the craving would go away.  I am totally addicted to these and will buy them again.

review/summary: very good!
review/text: Not sure it is necessarily healthy.  But, in our opinion, it is a much better alternative to HFCS and dyes.  They taste great and the kids love them.
