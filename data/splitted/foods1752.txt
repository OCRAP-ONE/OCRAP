review/text: I have two cats and one of them is very very independent and stubborn.  The only way to get the difficult cat to come into the kitchen at bedtime (and I close the door after she enters) is to open the kitty kavier and call her for her treat.  She absolutely loves it and has been having it every night for the past 18 months.  Now, the other sweet and cooperative cat wants her share as well.

review/text: This used to be my cats' favorite treat, but then they both suddenly went off it.  I decided to give it another try, and they're gobbling it up again.  I also use it as a 'garnish' for some foods that are very healthy for them, but that they don't particularly go crazy for.  It's a great product to have on hand.

review/summary: My daughter's cat goes nuts of these treats
review/text: My daughter's cat Mattie loves Kitty Kaviar.  Mattie is a big lovable Maine Coon cat.  Mattie sure loves to eat, but finding food/treats that Mattie is willing to eat is a Herculean task.  Mattie is one finicky eater, but one whiff of Kitty Kaviar and Mattie's tail shoots straight up.  He  immediately runs over when he sees the Kitty Kaviar can. On top of that, Kitty Kaviar is healthy and nutritious.  Kitty Kaviar is the best cat treat that I've ever purchased.  In the end, I  bought six cans, to keep Mattie and my daugther happy.

review/summary: Huge Disappointment
review/text: I have two cats, one of which didn't get to be 23 lbs by refusing cat treats.  After learning that my habit of treating them with tuna and tuna water straight from the can (one likes the fish, one likes the water) was likely causing bladder stones among other negative effects, I tried every single kind of cat treat available in an attempt to "wean" them onto something else.<br /><br />When I read about Kitty Kaviar I couldn't order it fast enough.  When I opened the can and my cats took a sniff, they couldn't run away fast enough.  I tried repeatedly to get them warmed up to Kitty Kaviar but neither would touch it.  These are NOT finicky cats - the one that ISN'T obese was a stray and went hungry for quite a while; we nicknamed her "vacuum girl" because she eats anything and everything.  Except Kitty Kaviar, that is.<br /><br />Am I the only one who has had this issue?  The reviews on here are so overwhelmingly positive, that I don't understand why I got the response that I did from my cats.  They are now in love with Pounce Lickkittys - so much cheaper but apparently so much better.  Unfortunately, because of Kitty Kaviar, I had to listen to my husband's "I told you so"s AND deal with two very disappointed kitties who thought they were getting something special.<br /><br />Buyer beware - product doesn't live up to the hype.  I tried to rate it 0 stars, but apparently that's not an option.

review/text: I was really happy to find another cat treat that was natural and free of fillers/preservatives/chemicals.  That said, none of my four cats will touch this stuff, even though two of them eat almost anything.  Much better to give them treats like Three Dog Bakery "We Pity the Kitties" freeze-dried salmon,  Feline Greenies, or just plain tuna.

review/text: These are not the clusters you may have been used to.  They would more appropriately be called oat clusters because the good old honey nut clusters are no more.  Set your expectations and they may be a suitable replacement.  The texture of the clusters is very different and the taste is slightly different.  The flakes taste more of fiber than I remember, but that may or may not be the case.

I have tried "similar" products but none compare to Honey Nut Cluster and I am sure nothing will ever compare to it. I have called General Mills to congratulate them on branding such a great cereal that is both kid and adult friendly. Sorry but I am a nut for Honey "nut" clusters. :-)

review/text: I'm surprised to read the other reviews for this product...I was soooo excited to find my favorite Honey Nut Clusters on Amazon after searching for so long in the grocery stores where I live. I could not contain my excitement the day I knew that they would be delivered!  I got home to find 3 beautiful boxes with that memorable little squirrel smiling at me... I had to have a bowl immediately!! As I poured the clusters into my bowl...I thought to myself "hmmmm...this doesn't look quite right"  I procedeed with faith that it had just been so long since I had seen the cereal.  As I took my first bite I knew it was too good to be true... "THESE ARE NOT THE HONEY NUT CLUSTERS I KNOW AND LOVE!!"  I continued to eat hoping that I was imagining it or that it would just take a few bites to set in.  But alas...Honey Nut Clusters truly do not exist anymore.  This cereal is more like Honey OAT Clusters I do not see NUT Clusters.  I even checked the other 2 boxes to insure that the first one was not just a bad batch.  So to all those Cluster lovers out there...I am sorry...but the end is here :-( RIP Original Honey Nut Clusters!!! You will be missed!!  As for those of you in search of the next best thing...Let me introduce you to Honey Graham Oh!s and you can get them at a grocery store near you!

review/summary: a bit heavy on the spice
review/text: While I enjoy a bit of spice in my tea, the cinnamon/cassia element in this tea way overpowers the raspberry. I was hoping for something similar of the blend of fruit and spice that's in Bigelow's Constant Comment, and this tea does not have that balance. It takes a LOT of sweetening to make this tea palatable, even when not brewed overly strong. I think this tea would be really good as a base for a tea punch -- say with apple cider -- which would help cut the strong cinnamon overtone.<br /><br />All in all, I'd recommend this tea if -- and only if -- you like a really strong spice flavor in your tea.<br /><br />I do intend to use all that I purchased, though I'll probably cut it with another variety of tea and/or a fruit juice. I may or may not purchase it again.

review/summary: Great Tea, Terrific Deal
review/text: This is the first Davidson's Tea that I've purchased and I'm pretty happy with it.  My preference in teas are those with stronger flavors.  The Spiced Raspberry has a good combination of tea and spices, but you definitely will want to be careful with it.  The tea tastes really good, but smell amazing.  Be careful though because steeping the tea too hot, and especially too long will result in an very overpowered, bitter flavor.  If this happens turn it into iced tea.  This will mild it down and tastes delicious.  I'm sure after I get through the entire pound of tea I will be wanting something different, but I will likely get another bag one day.  Overall very happy with the tea and I will be trying other Davidson's Teas.

The noodles are always pleasantly textured and the flavor packets are tasty, but not so overpowering that you can't add things to your soup to make it a meal. (seafood, vegetables, miso, seaweed, etc) Pricing is very good on these as well, and with amazon's free shipping they are far more affordable for me than driving 100 mile round trip to the nearest large town with an asian grocery that carries them.

review/text: Once I had one bag, I could not stop. I should have DOUBLED my order! These pork rinds were by far the most fresh, delicious, flavorful set I have had in a long long time. I am glad I took a chance with the variety pack. For those of us who like it hot and tangy, the spicy bbq will be right up your alley. The taste is a little bold. Hot sauce goes great but is optional. The salt and vinegar pork rinds have a very bold, distinctive scent. They may make you say "whew!!" when you first open them. Nevertheless, they have a powerful tang and are as crisp and wonderful as over. The plain pork rinds should be eaten with hot sauce, but can stand on their own just the same. The sweet and mind flavor is very quiet, very subtle. I suggest hot sauce on these as the flavoring is a tad quiet. It reminds me of the bbq flavor. Finally, the regular bbq flavor is the only one I really had a hard time tasting. Again, bring the hot sauce for this bag.<br /><br />All in all, It was a speedy, safe delivery I will be buying again and again. If you want pork rinds, do 'em right. Southern Things Inc. Has it down pat for this city gal.

review/summary: Good low carb salty snack
review/text: My wife hates these, the very idea of them offends her deeply. "Pork skin fried in fat with salt, how is that even remotely a good idea?"<br />She's never eaten one and I'm pretty sure she never will. She's never kissed me when I've eaten them either. So she really has no idea how good pork rinds are really.<br />They are a wonderful snack for people who are following an Atkins diet. Almost all the calories in these little puffs of goodness are from the fat, they have less than a gram of carbs per serving, and 7-8 grams of protein per serving.<br />Also darn tasty. They don't crunch so much as snap, they are salty and delicious with a bit of hot sauce. With all these flavors you can please lots of party guests.

The shipment arrived much faster than predicted, the rinds were fresh and flavorful, and my lo-carb pork tenderloins and "breaded" minute steaks are back on the table! Fantastic!

review/text: I haven't thought about "swine rind" in years.  Just reading the reviews instantly made me so hungry for these crunchy, wonderful puffs;I will go out tomorrow and get some.  One of my most vivid recollections is that of my first cousin sitting in his recliner watching TV eating "swine rind" he had just made himself, and drinking a 24 oz coca cola having the BEST time!!  He was a farmer and he had raised the pig, butchered it himself, cut it up, and took the skin and made pork rinds himself. His wife was always nagging him about eating so much pork because it had so much fat; she never did any research because then she would have found how low in fat swine rinds and I didn't notice she had any problem eating pork chops (lol). I have never tasted any snack food than just the original pork rinds. So, everybody who loves pork rinds raise your right hand and yell OINK, OINK.

review/text: This stuff tastes heavenly and it's a great alternative for people on a GF diet. Personally, I think they pack more of a punch than your ordinary soy sauce varieties.<br />The packets are kind of a pain when you want to cook at home as you have to cut open a handful of them and squeeze them all out, but I certainly didn't need 200 packets and a giant bottle of GF soy sauce.<br />Of course, the big reason for getting these in packet form is that you can take them with you and add them to any food you see fit. I love that I can enjoy sushi again thanks to Tamari sauce.<br />Also, I haven't had any problems with leakage either...so I'd just like to point out that it's not something everyone has to deal with when you order these.

What I have had the mispleasure of, is spending almost 2 hours cleaning soy sauce off of every last packet in the box...all 200 of them.  One of the packets was empty although it was sealed and it appears someone at the factory allowed the missing soy sauce to spray throughout the package box instead.  This item was packed in a larger order with A BOOK! and the leaking soy sauce ran through the packing box and started to soil the book I ordered.  Not a happy camper...

review/summary: Overall good...could be a teensy bit stronger
review/text: I've bought this coffee many times, both through amazon and in stores. I find that it's a decent brew but the flavor that's supposed to come through is very subtle. Also, the packaging is a little bit of a bother for me. I'd like a little description of a product & flavor when I buy coffee and usually you get that in other brands. But Arbuckle's doesn't provide that on their packaging so you find yourself guessing at what the flavor is supposed to taste like when u drink it. Also as written in my subject, the coffee is a bit on the light side. I've tried brewing with 2 packs, but that didn't cut it, so now what I do if I'm brewing this I usually mix it with my own gourmet French Roast just to give it some kick. That works, but then it kinda masks the supposed flavor of the coffee. Overall, I guess it doesn't hurt to try it, but for me I've gotten better flavored coffee elsewhere. As I said, it's tasty...just didn't have that WOW factor!

review/text: Got this for our 4 month old Frenchie and she loves it!  I only let her chew it for 15-20 min per day.  I noticed if she chews it longer than that she doesn't seem to enjoy it anymore (like a kid that gets unlimited candy on Halloween, they'll keep eating it, even if it's making them sick).  It also gives her bad gas :  But she loves it so much, so I deal with it.  Each piece lasts about 2 weeks when I give it to her on a limited basis.<br /><br />One complaint - small pieces flake off sometimes, making a mess on my rug.  I always put a sheet down before I give it to her.  Oh the things you do for your dog...<br /><br />You can find this for less on other websites.

review/text: My new 2 yr old, 8 lb. rescue Chihuahua really loves these chews. It takes her 3 hrs of real chewing to finish one. It like it because it's not dangerous like rawhide. My only concern is the noise when she's chewing on it. I'm not sure if it's the chew or her teeth that are "crunching". It really sounds like her teeth are cracking. She's quite the chewer. Everything else either sounds dangerous, like rawhide or crunches up too fast, but is safer. Anyone else have the breaking glass sound? I worry about her teeth and as much as I would like to buy them again, I may not.

For dog and owner both.<br /><br /> The bigger sizes can be pricey, but I'd buy. Utterly worth it. Luckily, I have littles, and for some reason, the bitty ones are a better value. Ounce by ounce the cost is the same, but with the little ones you get several treats instead of one.<br /><br />I love that, compared to virtually every other chew on the market, these things make *no mess* and have *no odor*. They are a good shape and size for handling and chewing. The small ones are heck to step on in bare feet, but it's a risk I'm willing to take.<br /><br />My 12 lb papillon and 15 lb chunky dachshund can get a nice firm grip on a chew and spend a pleasant afternoon with it and there will still be enough for another go. I do take them away when they reach choking-hazard size, and I wish I didn't have to, but I get nervous. They are rocks, after all. But they don't go to waste: I save them up to give to my uncle's 4 pound mini Yorkie, because then they're normal-sized for her teeny mouth.<br /><br />These treats are fun to tell your friends about. Doesn't "Himalayan Dog Chew" sound impressive? Far classier than "pizzle sticks"! Those things are the antithesis of these elegant treats.<br /><br />I call them "cheese" as in "Do you want your cheese?" "Where's your cheese?" "Quit burying your cheese in my pillow."<br /><br />Finally, and this is important, regarding my "toothless wonder" reference in my title:<br /><br />The papillon, Gigi, is missing a whopping 9 teeth. (Side note: Little dogs are at great risk for dental problems; get their teeth cleaned yearly!) She gamely tries to enjoy other chew treats, with some measure of success. But these are perfect for her, because she can just gum one kinda like a zwieback and get all the maximum goodness. If you have a dog missing teeth, they can get real pleasure out of these. The action of chewing combined with yumminess. It's a special joy to see her loving it.<br /><br />Gigi's my miracle dog. She's been paralyzed twice, had seizures, pneumonia, been bitten by a Brown Recluse, and has congestive heart disease. To see her settle down with a Himalayan Dog Chew and enjoy one of life's simple pleasures is one of *my* life's simple pleasures. Now you know why I spoil them.

review/summary: My dogs LOVE these!
review/text: Yes, these chews are a little expensive for consumables, but if you don't have dogs of destruction they'll last for a while. My first dog would find his occasionally and work on it for a while, then lose interest again. They'd last several weeks.<br /><br />Now that we've introduced a second dog they go three times as fast; the new dog likes them too, and now the "trophy" factor comes into play. As soon as one dog has one, the other becomes intensely interested in stealing it for themselves even if they walked right over it 2 minutes before. :D These are a staple at our house.

review/summary: My Pugs love these long-lasting chews!
review/text: Himalayan dog chews are a special treat for my Pugs...they seem to really like the taste and the chews last quite a long time and keep them occupied for a long time as well! Puggies will chew on these until they fall asleep; I will then take them away and save them for "next time". I love the fact that they are made with all natural ingredients (yak and cow milk, salt and lime juice), and help to clean their teeth and keep their breath fresh; they are much healthier and safer than rawhide, which I will not give to my dogs. These chews will be staple items I will always want to keep on hand for my Pugs.

review/summary: Made my dog sick
review/text: My pug gnawed through half a piece in 20 minutes and I pulled the rest of it away from him to save for another day.  It would not last all that long in my opinion, but I can live with that.  However, this stuff made him really sick.  The morning after he ate this chew, he wasn't all that interested in his regular food, but he ate it.  He then refused to eat his afternoon meal.  By the evening he still seemed uneasy about eating, but he ate because he was hungry I presume.  3AM that night, he threw up the entire day's food, completely undigested.  That scare resulted in $350 in vet bills as I had visions of Pancreatitis and what not.  Thankfully it wasn't something that serious and I nursed him back to health on a bland diet.  But this chew clearly did not sit well with him.  It might work for other dogs, but do keep in mind this is a dairy product and not a meat product.

review/summary: Long lasting, safe and irrisistable chews
review/text: After doing some research on the dangers of rawhide chews and Greenies, I decided to try some chews that were safer. But I also wanted something that would last. My female eats large (relative to her, she's 4.5 pounds) in about 8 seconds. After reading up, I got a bag of these Himalayan Chews and I also got some high quality bully sticks. Both are a huge hit, with these chews taking the top spot. These chews smell like good cheese, but I can only smell them if I do so intentionally. I don't smell them at all when the dogs have them. So far, the first chews have lasted four days, and they aren't even half-way eaten.

review/summary: My new go-to chew
review/text: I have a 17lb terrier mix and a 60lb boxer mix.  They have about the same amount of teeth and are both pretty aggressive chewers.  Rawhides last minutes and soft toys seconds with these two.  I give them the 3.5oz pieces.  They measure around 3" long and .5-1" square. I would describe the texture like one of the softer nylabone type bones except more appealing and safely consumable.  They occupy them completely for a few hours and then they seem to work them off and on for a few days. Antlers last much longer, but it seems the antlers they love most also tend to smell the most.  I have not noticed any smell during or after they chew these and I don't worry about them breaking off any pieces. They are a touch pricey, but i have two lucky dogs and no kids.  Worth every penny to have them quiet for the afternoon and I guess you get what you pay for (cheap = animal by-products from who knows where).  Another bonus is that while they seem to love to chew them, they don't get grabby over them like they sometimes do with rawhides and antlers.

review/summary: Small dogs find something else to chew
review/text: $1500 later......please learn from my experience and DO NOT buy these Himalayan Yak chews for your small dog.  I have a 14lb Shih Tzu who is a chewer and we were turned on to this product by our local high-end dog retailer (Mud Bay).  While the packaging does have some warning about when the chew gets small.....I have to say it's near impossible to babysit your dog's chewing.  A piece of this company's yak bone did in fact get caught in my dog's esophagus and we incurred some SIGNIFICANT bills to retrieve the item through endoscopy.  Not to mention all the pain and suffering my dog went through all because of a product he's supposed to chew on/eat.  It's just not worth it.  The chews in the package are smallish and you'll have to end up throwing nearly 1/2 of it away because it will become a choke hazard for your dog.  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!  I hope my review helps you steer clear of this product!

The first time I gave him a Chew he really did not know what to do with it, it was hard and he really had to work to<br />get the taste,,,,,,BUT ONCE he did, wow, he kept working hard and chewing for long periods of time,,,He also loves Bully STicks and while these are much more expense<br />these last a very very long time for a breed his size. He just got on his last piece and we are ordering more for him. He is our Pride and joy and giving him this treat, that is good<br />for him is a pleasure for us. If you love your 4 legged babies as much as we do, go ahead and treat them. You will smile at the pleasure they get while enjoying this healthy treat!<br />Awsome! Wish they offered in larger qty packages. Even though they last along time, never want to run out of our litte Sir Dash Alot's favorite treat!<br />Thanks for such an awsome product!<br />Clytie & Sir Dash Alot in NC

review/text: My dog will chew on this, if I put it right in front of him.  However, he'll never seek it out in the same way he will a bully stick or knuckle bone.  It's a good option to have laying around for him though -- longlasting, not sticky, no odor.  It is a bit small, however, and I worry about my small dog (miniature schnauzer) choking on it -- which may be more of a concern for larger dogs.

review/summary: "Thanks, Mom!  These are great!"
review/text: My 6-month corgi-mix puppy and 4 year old beagle love these.  They're real serious about their chew toys though, so the puppy has managed to get through about a 1/3 of her's in an hour.  The adult dog takes a much more reasonable pace.  The medium or large size might be better for my girls (20 and 40 pounds) though since these can get small as they chew on them.  Antlers are a good long lasting chew for my puppy, but they don't hold her attention.  But these are great if you're hosting a dinner party, for example, and want to be left in peace for a few hours.  I know what I'm stocking up on for exam week - Himalayan dog chews!

I have tried quite a few in this process and wasted a lot of money because they won't touch them.  The Himalayan Dog Chews are great!  They don't have an odor like a lot of chews.  They are very hard which means the dogs can chew longer.  Apparantly they taste great because my dogs love them!! This is their new go to treat!  Thank goodness my search is over.

review/text: My Havanese puppy loves to chew on this.  Good for long rides or for when he's just sitting around the house.  One tip I learned from others on the Havanese forum:  when the stick gets really small (like you're worried puppy will choke on it), put it in the microwave for about 35 seconds.  It will puff up and be usable again.<br /><br />As the other reviewers mentioned, this stick doesn't smell.

Lucy currently has no other chews so its not like she has a choice to pick from, she simply chooses to not 'chew' rather than use this product.  It has been a couple weeks now - no change.  It is expensive but she goes through other chews too fast, I thought it would be worth it.  Back to grass-fed bully sticks for us. Honestly, it must taste pretty bad if she won't eat/chew it.

review/summary: BEST CHEWS EVER!!!
review/text: I have tried all kinds of chews to try and keep my Pomeranian and Chihuahua busy and entertained. They eat every other chew way too quickly! These chews are great! They last for a very long time and my dogs keep going back to them. I'm back to order more so I always have these in stock! Being a veterinary technician, I have witnessed firsthand the dangers of rawhide chews. So I was always hesitant to give them to my small dogs for fear that they might become obstructed and need surgery. I feel so much better giving these to my dogs because they don't break off chunks. As the description states they soften a little and simply get smaller in size as your dog scrapes off bits with their teeth.  And when it gets small enough to become a hazard I just throw it away. I'm so glad I gave these a try!

review/text: I had hopes for this Espresso, based on the Douwe Egberts brand, and the claim of "Gourmet". Quality is an interesting thing, and perhaps after a buy-out of two, things change.  Now, under the SaraLee brand, cleverly well hidden on the wrapper (you really need to look for it), the taste is in the pudding.  And this coffee is just junk.  I am sure it had been sitting somewhere for a long time, a very long time. It had a horrid oxidized aroma when the bag was opened.  The expresso pull was disappointing, no creme, just the taste of old coffee.  As you might bet, the return policy is "no returns".  So, this gets to join the compost pile. Anyhow, one time for me was convincing.

review/text: Bought this item to help cover the taste of the coffee that some of my co-workers make.<br />You know the type, the kind that even a trucker would dump out.<br />Well the tablets were not strong enough.<br />Have not tried to use the item on coffee that a normal human would make.<br />Only three stars because I like the packaging and the aroma but have not found a good use for them as yet.
