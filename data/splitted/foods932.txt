review/text: Barley water is renowned in "knowing" circles, for it's tendency to create faultless complexions.  Some of the MOST famous beauties have used this beverage -- the company, Robinson's, was, as stated on their label, founded in 1823!  At least 2 generations -- probably many more -- of world-famous English beauties have used it.  (A hint as to who these beauties are, and were, is on the back label of the bottle.)<br /><br />I had heard of the value of barley water from a thin red book, which sadly has disappeared during the intervening years. I almost didn't buy this barley water, as I was afraid of a pebbly consistency.  However, I bought it and I am very glad I did!  The barley here is barley meal...very finely ground, and in any event, only 2% of the contents.  It tastes quite smooth and delicious when you drink it, either hot or cold.<br /><br />And this 33.2 ounce bottle is a CONCENTRATE!  The label directions suggest one part Robinson's Barley Water to four parts of water -- more water if it is given to young children.  These directions make emminent sense, as barley is often used in the manufacture of whisky.  No -- I doubt that anyone could ever get drunk from barley water...because the barley is un-fermented.  Still, the barley maes this otherwise lemonade-concentrate quite -- or even middling --strong stuff.  A little goes a long way.<br /><br />So, I'd recommend this for everyone.  Those who wish to have clear and radiant skin, to those who will not drink alchol, and for those who like lemonade.  As I haven't researched this product other than tasting it, I am sure there are many benefits to it that I have missed.  Yes, it does have some preservatives...but these are kept to a bare minimum in the content.<br /><br />The benefits of barley water should be better known, especially in the USA.  Robinson's Barley Water seems to be the very best!  Don't forget to dilute it..and drink it for your health, for good taste, (it's good taste -- and yours!), and for tge legendary benefit of totally beautiful skin!

review/summary: More like bottled juice with traces of barley
review/text: I use to have a lot of lemon barley water as a kid during summers. My physician was of the opinion that barley had a lot of medicinal value in curbing minor infections and strengthening the immmunity of the body.<br />However i was extremely dissapointed with this product as it does not have enough of barley which it should. This can be used with spirits for cocktails if u decide to go ahead purchasing it, but not worth it as there are better and cheaper products out there for your taste buds!

review/summary: great tea
review/text: At first I was not enamored with this tea because of the lack Bergamot essence. After reading the reviews complaining about this issue I had reservations about placing my second order. I am glad I ignored my feelings. The tea is now packed with a plastic cover over the paper packaging. My guess is it is there to preserve the needed additional Bergamot flavoring.<br />This tea is now the way it should be and I applaud Davidson's for making the change to better their product. I am on my third order and intend to remain a customer.<br /><br />Monday Mar 29 2010<br />I just received my latest shipment and what a pleasant surprise. New and better packaging of what seems a more robust and fragrant Earl Gray tea. Kudos to Davidson's for improving on their now very fine product. I now give it five stars.

review/text: I am very pleased with this decaf Earl Grey.  The tea leaves do have an odd smell - it almost smells like it is green tea - but the flavor is very nice.<br /><br />ETA: My first bag of this tea lasted me about a year, and I just ordered another bag in February 2011. This bag is different - there is a very strong citrus scent from the leaves, which is odd, but I think the flavor is even better than last year's bag. I upgraded my rating from 4 to 5 stars.

review/text: I would say my family is addicted to oatmeal, including my two very young children. We eat oatmeal at least 5 days a week for breakfast and sometimes the kids want it for dinner! This oatmeal is amazing, after purchasing it many times at our local grocery store I decided to see if I could score it cheaper on Amazon and sure enough I did! This oatmeal is delicious, not only for kids but for adults too. It has chunks of real fruit in it and has wonderful flavor. I love that it's organic and is now made with less sugar then before. I recently started making huge batches of homemade oatmeal since we go through so much but I still order and keep this on hand for a variation. Great oatmeal, you won't be sorry if you choose any Country Choice Organic Oatmeal!

review/summary: Chai for the common person
review/text: This chai is not the same as the chai I had at a great Indian restaurant just south of Golden Gate park in San Francisco. I live in the middle of nowhere -- authentic chai is just something that I'll save for vacations.<br /><br />But for me at home, Bombay Chai is just fine. It tastes good and you can see whole/larger pieces of spices in the bag. The Bombay chai is much more flavorful than Tazo or Good Earth (yuk) that I can find at my supermarket.<br /><br />I live 70 miles from the nearest Whole Foods market where I can buy Bombay Chai, that's why I ordered it here on Amazon. I had purchased a box of it from WF and really enjoyed it.<br /><br />I steep the tea, remove the bag and stir in some sugar free fat free vanilla powder, some nonfat milk and vanilla protein powder. I just love it this way.<br /><br />All you tea purists can go fortify yourself now with some totally authentic tea that was brought from India on the back of sacred cattle that swam across the Ganges before being loaded into a specially blessed cargo container. I'll just sit over here and enjoy my chai with my peanut butter toast.

review/summary: The tea that started it all
review/text: When I was in an upscale restaurant near work one day, I was looking for a tea from their selection, and couldn't find anything basic like English Breakfast or any of the usual black teas.  What I did find was Chai.  I had no clue what Chai tea was, but thought I would give it a try, for lack of any better options.  Am I glad I tried it.  It had a flavor unlike any tea I had ever tried, with a dessert spice taste, without being too overpoweringly spicy.  I liked it so much that months later I had to call that restaurant to ask them what brand of tea they had been serving, to get some for myself and for Christmas gifts.  I have tried other brands of Chai tea but none compare, the worst being whatever brand they were serving in that certain Canadian donut shop that we all go to (it was very watered down and flavorless).  While Chai tea isn't something I drink daily - I usually want something more basic black and not spicy - it is a great treat once in a while when I want something more unusual and desserty.  Although not the traditional way to make it, I prefer drinking it with water, not with milk as the Indian restaurants would serve it.

review/summary: I love Mighty Leaf, but this cannot be called "chai" tea
review/text: I love Mighty Leaf teas and have found no other teas that can match their quality, taste, and freshness.  However the Bombay Chai falls far below my expectation for an authentic chai tea.  The tea tastes very weak and is lacking the robust black tea taste that a chai tea should have.  The taste created by Bombay Chai departs from the traditional chai tea taste.  In my opinion, this tea cannot even be considered a "chai" tea.  Yes, the spices used are traditional chai spices, however the flavor is not that of chai. After my great experience with other Mighty Leaf teas, I was greatly disappointed with their attempt at a chia tea recipe.<br /><br />Yet in spite of Mighty Leaf Bombay Chai's shortcoming, this tea is still far more healthy and tasty than the boxed chai teas on the market - Oregon Chai and Tazo Chai (sold by Starbucks).  These boxed chai teas are what most Americans consider chai, however they are very far from it.  These boxed chai teas are dessert drinks that are loaded with sugar digest horribly.<br /><br />Chai tea spices are medicinal in nature, supporting the function of different organs and reducing the "dampness" (Chinese Medicine) or "kapha" (Ayurveda Medicine) of the milk used to create a more balanced drink.<br /><br />I have traveled India and tasted authentic chai tea - both in south India and north India (subtly different recipes).  I have even had the pleasure to taste very rare varieties of black tea leaves.  Unfortunately I have never tasted chai tea outside of India that resembles what I have enjoyed in India.  My own experiments with chai spices have created chai tea that is closer than what is sold in America, however there is a uniqueness to chai tea in India that is difficult to replicate.<br /><br />I find that I can create a more authentic chai tea by using Mighty Leaf Organic Breakfast Tea combined with a blend of chai spices (cardamom, cinnamon, ginger and cloves).  Or if I am in a hurry, I skip the spices and use a tea bag of Tulsi Red Chai Masala (caffeine-free Roiboos tea, not black tea).  I find this unique combination of black tea and roiboos a tasty recipe.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDP11Y">Organic India Tulsi Red Chai Masala, 18-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET5Y0M">Mighty Leaf Tea, Organic Breakfast, Tea Bags, 15-Count Box, Biodegradable Whole Leaf Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />-- My Praise for Mighty Leaf Teas ---<br /><br />Mightly Leaf Tea should be considered in a class of it's own for tea. The leaves and herbs used are extremely fresh. When you open a plastic (not paper that breathes) pouch, you are immediately hit with the sweet aroma of fresh tea. I have never smelled another tea bag that even comes close to the freshness. Even most bulk teas are not packaged correctly or quick enough at the manufacturer to keep this much freshness in the tea.<br /><br />Mighty Leaf Tea is a bit more expensive than other organic tea, however the quality of the leaves and herbs is the highest. Might Leaf Tea uses large pieces of leaves, herbs, and flowers - unlike most teas that use shreds of leaves. Shredded tea oxidizes very quickly due to the increased surface area. This results in tea that loses flavor and smell very quickly.<br /><br />Mighty leaf uses silk bags which have larger pores than paper bags. This means that the water penetrates the tea bags more fully, allowing the newly tea-infused water to spread to the cup more quickly. Brewing tea too long will create a bitter taste. The problem with most paper tea bags is that infused tea water cannot spread quickly enough through the cup to create a bold, full flavor before the 3-5 brewing time has passed. This means that either your tea is not full flavored or is bitter. Mighty Leaf solves this problem by using silk bags.<br /><br />Each Mighty Leaf Tea bag is sealed in a plastic pouch. Since plastic is less porous than paper, these pouches keep the tea and herbs fresher longer.<br /><br />There is nothing to not like about Mighty Leaf Tea. I only wish that Mighty Leaf Tea started selling Tulsi tea and I would be in Heaven.<br /><br />Mighty Leaf Tea is clearly the creation of tea experts who appreciate the highest quality organic ingredients. They have created a tea bag system that is far beyond what any other company has done. Every type of tea that Mighty Leaf Tea offers tastes incredible. So choose your favorite flavor and enjoy tea as it should be experienced - fresh, bold, and delicious.

review/summary: Sugary Pineapple
review/text: These are good pineapples; they seem fresh, not chewy, etc., but I don't understand why Harmony found it necessary to add so much sugar. For a company that touts itself as healthy and natural, they sure add way more sugar than necessary. The first few bags it didn't bother me so much, but now I can hardly eat them without feeling sick followed by a big sugar crash. Pineapple by itself is sweet, and then when it's dried it's a concentrated sweetness, why on top of that did they feel the need to add more sugar? They are coated with it sort of like those round sunkist fruit candies! I surely wish I could find another brand that is inexpensive and doesn't add sugar...

review/text: This is our second case of delicious, not-too-sweet dried pineapple at an amazing price that can't be beat!!! One review states that one of the ingredients is a petroleum-derived chemical. This is a bit ambiguous. The ingredients list is as follows (which I copied directly from one of the bags): "Pineapple (pineapple, sugar, citric acid, natural and artificial flavor, sodium metabisulfite and/or sulfur dioxide added as a preservative." First, the list states "and/or," which means it may or may not be in it; and, second, the definition of sulfur dioxide is "a colorless toxic gas (SO2) that occurs in the gases from volcanoes." Despite this remote possibility, it is extremely tasty and contains much less sugar than other brands of dried pineapple. All I can say is: Y U M ! ! !

review/summary: The king of instant ramen
review/text: Instant ramen is a handy thing to have in the cupboard for a fast and tasty lunch or dinner. With healthy additions like chopped veggies (frozen are fine, just nuke before adding to the broth), I don't feel too guilty about indulging in this quick meal occasionally.<br /><br />The Myojo Chukazanmai line is the best of the best where instant ramen is concerned. The oriental flavor is rich, complex, and slightly seafood-y; it's my favorite. The noodle quality is great, too. In the summer, I'll cook the noodles alone, and when done, shock them cold under running water. Then add a bit of cold Japanese men-tsuyu (noodle broth), a dash or two of sesame oil, and chopped red ginger (beni-shoga). Chop up lettuce and/or cucumbers if you have them; maybe some ham or chicken if available. Great cold pasta dish!

review/summary: Tasty, but expensive and high-sodium
review/text: I purchased these hoping they would be a healthier alternative to the cheap Nissan/Maruchan 10 cent noodles you find everywhere. I've consumed literally hundreds of the Nissin/Maruchan, but stopped several years ago because they are just so ridiculously bad for you. I am a recovering addict - on some days I used to eat 6 packs! Make no mistake, these Myojo are healthier for you but they are NOT healthy. One serving has 120% of your DV of sodium (2900mg) and 6 grams of fat/2 grams of saturated fats, 68g of carbs (2g fiber). They also contain MSG in both the dry seasoning and liquid soupbase.<br /><br />Nutrition aside, I was anxious to try these to see how they compare to the cheap ramen. I have an aversion to anything seafood-related so I was dismayed to see the dry seasoning packet contains scallop and clam extract. HOWEVER, I was willing to give these a shot anyway. I cooked up the noodles for the suggested 4 minutes, and stirred in the dry seasoning and liquid (oil/soy sauce) packets. The seafood smell was too much for me - I had to dump it out and then mix it with one of the beef seasoning packets from the Maruchan noodles. As for the liquid packet - it adds a nice smokey, rich flavor to whatever seasoning you choose to use. The texture of the noodles is good and comparable to cheap ramen.<br /><br />The price of these is quite high. You might love the flavor of the seasonings and enjoy that they are not as fatty as cheap ramen, but ask yourself if these are worth up to 24 times the price. If they had lower sodium and less carbs, I could see these being worth it.<br /><br />My next ramen adventure is to try GreeNoodle without seasoning (ASIN: B0054S0P9E).

review/summary: pretzels
review/text: I love the pretzels; I just do not like having to buy such a large quantity at one time. I had to get 12 bags at one time, I have 10 bags left, today is Sept. 17th and the expiration date on the bags is Oct. 10th. There is no way that I am going to eat 10 bags of pretzels in 3 weeks; I am the only one in my family who eats them. Now I know that they will not go "bad," but I do not want stale pretzels. I cannot find them in stores anymore, so I had to buy them because I do love them so much and Amazon.com was the only place that I could find them. I am going to have to cancel my current ongoing order with Amazon and try to find another option where I do not have to get so much at one time.

It looks like someone opened one of the bags, removed a good portion of the candy and threw the rest in to get shipped. Ad should state that half of what you order will actually ship. I'm very unsatisfied, and wonder if this was not an accident. Is it worth pursuing over such a small $ amount? I'm undecided at this point.

My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

To flavor our foods, Carol Bernick, Executive Chairman of the Alberto-Culver Company, developed Mrs. Dash back in the 1980's.  She became frustrated with flavoring products that contained large amounts of salt.  She wanted a convenient way to flavor food without using salt.  She went to work and developed . . . by tasting, testing, and tweaking . . . a unique blend of flavorings with the taste she liked.  Mrs. Dash is now the most popular salt-free blend in the seasoning category.<br /><br />It contains onions, black pepper, parsley, celery seed, basil, bay, marjoram, oregano, savory, thyme, cayenne pepper, coriander, cumin, mustard, rosemary, garlic, carrots, orange peels, lemon juice powder, citric acid, tomatoes, and oil of lemon.<br /><br />In addition to the taste that will make you not miss your salt shaker, it has an intriguing rough texture that I enjoy.  There is something amusing on the 6.75 ounce jar:  it has "about 273 servings" of � teaspoon each.<br /><br />It is great for seasoning fish, chicken, and collard greens.<br /><br />We are bombarded on a regular basis with the ever-present threat of hypertension and resultant strokes. The public dietary enemy number one --according to many authorities -- is sodium.  At first, sodium was considered bad for people with high blood pressure and/or congestive heart failure.  Now it is recommended that everyone restrict sodium intake. Massive quantities of sodium are in most mixed spices, canned vegetables, canned meat, processed meat, restaurant food, and cheese. (Read the labels!)<br /><br />While it is difficult to eat in the modern environment without overly salting our bodies, it is possible to use Mrs. Dash when we can.  Those of us with no loss of kidney efficiency can substitute potassium chloride for salt, but many of us have medical problems that do not allow us to make this choice.  Also some people object to the aftertaste of potassium.  A � teaspoon shake of Mrs. Dash has only 10 mg potassium, which is a negligible amount; and it has 0 mg sodium.<br /><br />Even if there were no health concerns related to its use, I'd still choose Mrs. Dash to liven up food.  We eat in a cafeteria three days a week where the food is bland, and we keep a container of Mrs. Dash handy there.

review/summary: Tasty Pastries
review/text: The plain Apple Cinnamon was the first ones that I tried.  After reading some of the reviews, I went out and bought the frosted Apple along with the Frosted Strawberry.  Once again I agree with previous posters stating that the frosted is better than the plain. For me it is almost a tie between the Apple Cinnamon and the Strawberry.  The Strawberry might be slightly better.  I'd like to try the other flavors, and I don't think I'll be disappointed.

review/summary: Tastes good, and organic but refined sugar and flour.
review/text: Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour.  That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.<br />They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item.

review/summary: Lots of Sugar!
review/text: I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like "Pop Tarts" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item.

review/summary: Well, it's a toaster pastry, what can you say?
review/text: I tried these, even though I haven't had a toaster "pastry" since I was a kid (and didn't much care for them then, either).  For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle.  However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again.  They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of "frosting" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much "sweet cardboard".  Just not really worth eating, in my opinion.  A piece of toast with jam is more appealing.

review/summary: Awesome!  Better than Pop Tarts!
review/text: I stopped eating pop-tarts because of all the junk that was in them (hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, etc).<br /><br />I tried these and - wow!  They are actually better tasting than pop-tarts.  They still have the rich buttery crust, but their filling is actual fruit, and tastes incredible.<br /><br />These look exactly the same as pop-tarts, right down to the foil wrapper and little grooves on the back of the pastry.  They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors.<br /><br />This doesn't make them completely "healthy" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome.

The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts.  Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so.  This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried.

review/summary: A tasty, kosher, healthier alternative to Pop Tarts
review/text: First and foremost, these toaster pastries taste great! You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy.

It might have more of a berry flavor to it.  Compared to a pop tart they're not as flavorful, but they're a step in the healthy direction.  They've got enough sweet to get the job done. Make sure whichever one you buy, that you get the frosted and not the plain.  The plain is too dull without the frosting complimenting it. The only fruit flavor left for me to try now is the blueberry.

Or, to eliminate unnecessary packaging, pack them without the individual wrappers in the box.

It has a real fruit taste and a real pastry taste, not like regular brand & store brands that have always left me with indigestion and a lingering unpleasant taste.  Plus they have healthier ingredients than regular brands so I can feel good about giving these one or two times a week for really quick breakfasts or on the go breakfast when necessary.  We have embraced organic foods since the mid 1990's and these are among the best.  Amazon offers a better deal  than the ones we got at retail store.  By the way, strawberry frosted is our family's second favorite flavor.  Recommend trying them.  Five stars for sure.

review/summary: 10 thumbs way up!
review/text: Every one of my children love these toaster pastries...which is hard to accomplish in this house!  I had originally purchased them from our local health food store($3.89/box) because my pickiest eater begged for them.  Obviously, I'm not going to continuously pay that much for a box of 6 toaster pastries.  So, I went on the hunt for the best price.  I purchased these through Subscribe & Save on Amazon and I get them for $2.29/box with free shipping.  That means I don't even have to go TO the store.  What a deal!  We're going to try the Wildberry Acai next...I'll let you know what we think of those!

review/summary: Great buy
review/text: I bought this item to eat healthier and was very surprised at the fantastic taste.  My grandson loves them.  My friends even asked me to order more boxes and they are junk food nuts but didn't care that these are a healthy alternative.  They love them too!

review/summary: Toaster Pastries/Cherry Pomegranate
review/text: One of the best, if not the best, Toaster Pastries on the market.  This flavor, Frosted Cherry Pomegranate, is excellent.  I haven't tasted better.  It is good cold or hot and as a snack, it is good  anytime.  Great for the kids.  The price is right. Its organic so no nasty surprises in the ingredients.

review/summary: Great alternative to "PopTarts", but add more filling!
review/text: These are a great alternative to PopTarts. I've only tried the strawberry. Crust, icing, filling - all are delicious. My only change would be to make the filling thicker. The outer edges of the crust can be a little dry without a bit of the filling to go with it so I find myself breaking off the outside edges to get to the yummy middle. Maybe I'm just picky. But otherwise, I love them!

review/summary: better than the non-frosted
review/text: If you're going to go for the Apple, I'd recommend the frosted.  Sure it's more sugar, but it's also a lot more flavor.

review/summary: A Sinful Treat... With A Little Less Sin
review/text: Okay, in the grand scheme of things, if you're closely watching your calorie intake... these aren't for you. Yes, they are organic! LOVE that they are organic! But they have similar stats to their non-organic counterpart (one of these toaster pastries has 210 calories and 5g fat while the other non-organic brand's toaster pastries average the same - 210 calories and 5g fat). However, it's nice to see that the first ingredient in Nature's Path Frosted Raspberry toaster pastries is Organic Wheat Flour, while the other brand's first ingredient is enriched flour). At any rate, I picked up two different flavors of Nature's Path toaster pastries from my local Whole Foods and I haven't been able to stop eating them since. I bought the Wildberry Acai on Amazon without having tried them first, since I had yet to be disappointed by a flavor of theirs to date. While they are not my favorite flavor (the iced Raspberry and Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are beyond amazing), they definitely leave my tastebuds satisfied. I wouldn't say these are guilt-free, but I do feel less guilty knowing that they are organic!

review/text: We love Pop Tarts (the name brand ones) but wanted to get away from all the chemicals, food dyes, and especially HFCS that those are loaded with. These are a great substitute!

review/summary: Not health food, but far, far better than Pop-Tarts
review/text: Making the change from a typical American diet to a healthier organic and more whole-grain centered diet is no mean feat with my 6-year-old.  I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.  I refuse to buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it so, needless to say, Pop-Tarts are not known in my house.  When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.  What a concept.<br /><br />I also want to note that purchasing them through subscribe and save is a considerable savings over buying them in the grocery store.  When all is said and done, I'll have paid about a dollar a box less by ordering these through Amazon rather than buying them at Whole Foods.  I not only like to eat healthier, I also like to trim the fat from my wallet.

review/summary: Awsome Product
review/text: My inlaws gave my kids the dreaded cardboard "pop-tarts", and well it has been difficult to find a natural, kosher replacement. Well folks here it is, my kids eat them all the time, they make a perfect snack that is not junk. I wish more variety packages were available. I absolutely reccomend this product in all flavors.
