review/summary: a good & hearty lunch option for vegetarians
review/text: As a vegetarian it can be more difficult to find healthy, tasty, and quick lunch options.  Usually you can find two out of those three qualities but the elusive third will keep you searching.  Well look no more as here's the cup of soup that dreams are made!  The thing I love most about Dr. McDougall's products is that they aren't packed full of salt.  The flavor is full and the noodles are just right.  This cup of soup and a piece of fruit makes a great fulfilling lunch with the added bonus of just grabbing and going to work -I don't have to get up any earlier to pack a good lunch! Definitely recommend for vegetarians and thai food lovers alike.

review/summary: It's no Pad Thai, but it's yummy anyway.
review/text: This is my favorite of the Dr. McDougall's soups I've tried so far, particularly because it has incredibly simple cooking directions. I don't think it tastes particularly like Pad Thai, but it's a nice, spicy little soup that definitely fills me up for lunch (and I'm a big, hungry guy). A splash of Sriracha in this baby goes a long way.

review/text: Tastes more like a combination of Thai lemongrass soup and hot and sour soup instead of actual pad Thai.  Very nice spice factor to it and good amount of noodles that satisfy.  Filling for lunch or dinner.  Ordered through Amazon prime and literally received in 24 hours!  Signed up for subscription service and paying only 1.50 per cup, a good deal in my book and love that it comes directly to my door.  I would otherwise have to drive 45 minutes to buy in a local grocery store.  So pleased!  Tasty and cheap lunch option.  Will keep several in my desk for work!  Thanks Amazon and thanks Dr. McDougall!

review/summary: There are better McDougall varieties
review/text: I have to agree with the other naysayers on this one.  It has an odd flavor to it and I suspect it's because of the fruit powders - I think the tamarind powder gives it the weird flavor/aftertaste.  I think I would like this a lot more if that were absent.<br /><br />I don't know much about Thai cooking but others are saying it doesn't taste like Pad Thai anyway, so removal of what may be a Thai ingredient (tamarind) isn't going to make sales go down.<br /><br />There's still the standard good stuff that stands for most McDougall varieties. You get a lot of it, it's convenient and great to have around at the office for a more healthy-than-the-vending machine snack.  I suspect it would be more satisfying too, nice and hot soup mmm!<br /><br />So, I won't be buying it again.  May I recommend the Spring Onion Noodle Soup?  That is a very tasty one to buy in lieu of this variety.

review/text: these are very tasty and so quick and easy to prepare. my only gripe with these is that the paper cup has the tendency to leak out of the bottom. if they used a foam cup like the ramen noodle cups, there wouldn't be this problem, and it would be easier to handle too, since the paper cup gets quite hot whereas the styrofoam does not. regardless of these annoyances, i still higly recommend this product. one could easily put this in their own bowl to avoid the leaking and heat issues.

This stuff is more like "barely tastes like food."<br /><br />I was looking for a gluten free version of the cup o' noodles products that are so tasty (and so not good for you!).  This wasn't it.  I won't say that I had to choke it down, but it wasn't very far from that.  Out of an abundance of optimism, I'll probably try one more flavor of Dr. McDougall's cups -- this was the first I'd tried -- but I'm guessing that after that I'll be done with this brand for good.

review/summary: I am not crazy about it
review/text: I really love pretty much all of the Dr. McDougall soups that I have tried... but this one was a disappointment. First off, they should NOT call it Pad Thai. It is a thai-ish rice noodle soup but it is nothing like Pad Thai or even a "Pad Thai soup." Seriously, I have no idea why they call it that. The noodles were good but the soup had a somewhat gritty texture. It was not that flavor-full. I would recommend you try the hot and sour soup instead - much better! I will eat the rest of the package, but I definitely will not order this again.

review/text: I liked Dr. McDougall's split pea soup and his oatmeal, so I decided to try this.<br /><br />Oh man. I could not believe how disappointing this was. The ony PRO was that it was chock full of noodles. If you love rice noodles, the Asian style, this has oodles.<br /><br />But the flavor was lacking. So bland, it was like someone took the soup and watered it down and served noodles in saltyish water. It's called Pad  Thai soup, but as a pad thai afficionado, I can't say I noticed any resemblance to pad thai--other than Asian noodles.<br /><br />If you like watery noodle soup, go for it.<br /><br />If you actually want a burst of Thai yumminess, this is not a soup I can recommend.<br /><br />Mir

review/text: The Black Bean Soup is very good so I was hoping I found another winner in the Pad Thai Noodle Soup. Not so. The fruit flavors and other flavors are a little too overpowering. The freeze dried vegetables give a startling contrast to the soft noodles that make me feel like something got into the cup that shouldn't be there. It does travel well and it is filling. But I won't buy this flavor again.

However, the product is described as a soup, and that should have been a tip off, since Pad Thai is more of a spicy noodle dish than a soup.  You won't find either the flavor or texture that you'll find in real Pad Thai.

review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

review/text: I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.

review/text: This is a wonderful product.  I am buying another case tonight to take advantage of the great price.  My son was amazed at what an improvement this product is over the Kraft products. The sauce is similar in consistancy to Alfredo and the pasta is fabulous.  The pasta holds up to cooking and mantains it's al dente consistancy. Amazing what plain and simple ingredients produce.

review/summary: I know my mac & cheez
review/text: The Annie's product compares favorable to Kraft Mac & Cheese.<br /><br />I just can't let stand some mis-information comparing the two.<br /><br />One correction needed is "I love mac and cheese and I know how to make it.  --  The cheese powder doesn't dissolve entirely, and it tends to stick to the pasta in dry little clumps rather than blend into an actual sauce."<br /><br />But if the preparation instructions are followed this is nearly impossible to happen.  On the other hand, if one were to improperly prepare the Annie's product (for example using the Kraft preparation instructions), then this is exactly what you could get - clumps!  The Annie product preparation instruction state to put 2-4 tablespoons of skim milk + the cheese sauce mix into the warm empty pot and wisk well until SMOOTH, and only then to add the cooked pasta into the pot.  Whereas, Kraft tells you to pour the dry cheese powder on top of the cooked pasta.<br /><br />As to the calories: "Now hear this: Annie's has more and fat and calories than KRAFT."<br /><br />This is not true, again, if prepared according to the instructions.  Kraft is 380 calories 23% from fat whereas Annie's is only 290 calories 8% from fat.<br /><br />Note that Annie's obtains this by eliminating the need for butter. If someone were go and add the same amount of butter to the Annie's recommended preparation method, then the calories and fat count would be higher.  But this would be silly, since the Annie's cheese mix is blended to replace the need for the butter.<br /><br />Side note: Annie's does list an alternative higher fat preparation method using � the amount of butter as Kraft.  In this case the calories would be roughly 350 with 18% coming from fat, still a little less than found with Kraft.

review/summary: Food you can feel good about
review/text: This is the only brand of boxed macaroni and cheese that I will serve to my five year old and this is the only one she will eat. First of all, the ingredient list speaks for itself. It's made from only a small handful of all natural ingredients (none of those obscure, unpronounceable ingredients!) and you can feel good about giving it to your children (and to yourself as well!). Not only is it a much healthier choice than most other boxed mac and cheese dinners, but it tastes great, too! Perfectly cheesy and delicious. Our little girl just loves it and so do we! It's not too difficult to prepare either and it's one of those last minute, throw-togethers on busy days that you can count on. Stock your pantry shelf with Annie's..you won't be sorry.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Allow me to preface this by saying that though I bought this product, I never ate it is as.  I always added some steamed broccoli, sliced fried ham, or (on one somewhat unfortunate occasion) Johnsohnville cheddar sausages.  However, Annie's has always proved to be a delicious and satisfying base, and sprucing it up with veggies and meat works wonders.  It's easy to go overboard when you add the milk, but I've never been too picky about the consistency of my mac'n'cheese anyway, and it tastes great.<br /><br />I'm a pretty athletic male college student, and eating half a box or a little more is enough to satisfy me for dinner, so this is an incredible deal.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: Every one in my family really loves Annie's Mac and Cheese. My daughter used to sit down and eat a whole child sized cup of it when she was one. We always add 1/2 cup of peas, green beans, or corn to it just before we put the pasta in to boil so it has veggie appeal.<br /><br />We use the older recipe for putting it together. The old recipe is often printed on the side of the box in smaller print. When you add both the milk (at least 1%) and the butter it is very good. It is best if you use 2% or whole milk. The thicker the milk the cremier the sauce is.  However we don't always have the thicker milk on hand.<br /><br />We highly recommend this product.

review/text: FIRST THOUGHTS: For those of us who were ready to give up on Macaroni and Cheese there is finally a decent product available which finally combines taste with a healthy ingredients -- for a welcome change!<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: JUST READ THE INGREDIENTS ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX<br /><br />There are many brands of Macaroni and Cheese and some even taste pretty good and cost less than Annie's product [offered here]. The difference is simple -- THE INGREDIENTS;<br /><br />DURUM SEMOLINA PASTA, CHEDDAR CHEESE, PASTEURIZED MILK, SALT, WHEY, BUTTERMILK, BUTTER -- that's all!<br /><br />Surprisingly, I had never had this stuff before I was included in a sort of improvised taste test -- Annie's Homegrown Shells & White Cheddar won out over Kraft and several decent store brands. What is best about Annie's is that I felt very good after eating a large portion of this traditional meal and now want to use Annie's exclusively for both taste and nutrition.<br /><br />BUT THAT'S NOT ALL --<br /><br />Annie's has a whole line of these products and many are 'Certified Organic'. This particular product is NOT 'CERTIFIED ORGANIC', nevertheless, it contains NO artificial ingredients which are usually found in abundance in the other brands.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

review/summary: A Lighter Mac and Cheese for a Nice Change
review/text: One of my most vivid childhood memories was the baked macaroni and cheese at Luby's Cafeteria in Dallas, Texas. It had a nice brownish crust and a tomato slice baked on top, and the woman in the hairnet always gave me an extra big portion. I was never as much a fan of Kraft's Macaroni and Cheese mix since it always struck me more as a saucy pasta dish than an actual casserole. While Annie's Shells & White Cheddar is definitely much closer to the Kraft variation, I still enjoyed it more than I expected. The sauce has a nice buttermilk flavor that helps make the cheese taste less dominant.<br /><br />It has a much lighter taste that doesn't have the grainy taste that often comes with the pre-made cheese packets. The pasta shells are the mini variety made of durum semolina. Quite tasty. The bunny rabbit on the box made me think this was possibly a child's dish, but it doesn't matter to me. It was certainly good enough as a side dish to some chicken I made this evening. The box contains three servings, making the portions feel accurate for a change. Each serving is 290 calories of which 45 come from fat. There are 4.5 grams of fat, 2.5 of which are saturated but fortunately none of it is trans fat. Sodium is unsurprisingly high at 550 mg due mostly to the cheese mix. Definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Alfredo Shells
review/text: Similar in taste to an Alfredo sauce, the White Cheddar cheese sauce tastes delicious with the tiny shell pasta.<br /><br />Ingredients: Durum Semolina, water, cheddar cheese, milk, salt, whey, buttermilk, butter.<br /><br />The 7-ounce box is enough for one to two people depending on how hungry you are at the time. You can make this as directed or while the pasta is draining, put the pan/pot back on the stove and melt 1-2 tablespoons of butter and then add the milk (or you can use half-and-half to make it dreamy creamy) and packet of powdered cheese sauce. Add the pasta back into the sauce and serve with a sprinkling of freshly grated parmesan and freshly ground pepper.<br /><br />No Chemicals<br /><br />No MSG<br /><br />No anything that isn't good for you...just tasty delish.<br /><br />Probably the only box of macaroni and cheese with a bumper sticker on the side saying:<br /><br />"Be Green<br /><br />Help the Earth Live"<br /><br />I like the cute "Rabbit of Approval" sticker on the Annie's Homegrown products. They are all delicious (not overly salty like other brands, you know who I'm talking about) and you feel good eating such a healthy product.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Taste-wise, it's Lacking
review/text: The idea of going organic with these types of products makes me feel somewhat better about grabbing it for a quick fix meal solution. Cooking, it's just as easy as any other name brand on the market, and I refer to the stovetop method. A small sucepan full of water, 5-8 minutes of boiling the pasta, mix up the sauce accordng to directions and walla, instant, easy meal that's great in a bowl at your computer or in front of the tube with your favorite movie.<br /><br />The first bite was decent, the sauce doesn't have too powdery a texture and the pasta's your average, ordinary shells. Cooked al dente, they have a nice texture your teeth can really sink into. But after about half my portion, the taste gets more and more bitter (yes, my milk was still good). It's got all the appearance of any normal mac and white cheddar cheese product, but the taste on this one is sorely lacking. I've never encountered a product like this that I didn't care for, so I just went with the directions and tried it traditional style. Maybe it would be better "dressed up" somehow, but considering that there are better tasting products (prepared per directions with no dressing up) like this, I'd be more likely to dress up one of those. If you're interested in trying out similar products, consider Kraft's Organic White Cheddar shells or Back to Nature's White Cheddar and Spirals.

review/summary: A little bit different from most.
review/text: Anyone who loves mac-n-cheese has tried some type of brand of shells-n-cheese. The only difference is the shape of the pasta. It became a huge hit with kids because it is so cheesy.<br /><br />Then various companies decided to use real cheese spreads, usually with some sort of plastic or foil pouch encloused. These caught on quickly for good reason. Not only can consumers see that they are getting, in most cases, real cheese, but consumers feel that they are making the dish healther for the family.<br /><br />Whether that is true or not depends mainly on WHICH brand you used. The more expensive the brand does not always mean more healthy. Let us face it, many powders are just as good tasting and as healthy for your family as the squeeze. It was psychological. It worked.<br /><br />Then came microwave mac-n-cheese. This quickly became a busy parent's dream. However, it is not much faster than stove top. (Perhaps 4 minutes.) But when people think of microwaves, they think "fast". So this is currently the new craze. Not much faster and still bowls to wash. You usually get LESS pasta this way too, even though you are paying just a little bit more than normal for what you think is convenient.<br /><br />KRAFT advertises more than most brands, so shoppers are more apt to pick up the KRAFT brand. Think about it. How many ads do you recall seeing about ANNIE'S HOMEGROWN? Personally, I do not recall a single one. Therefore, most people totally ignore this brand.<br /><br />Bad move. If you check out the box, this brand is actually better for you, yes, more healthy for you, than KRAFT. Cost is about the same as well.<br /><br />But this comes with a little twist, ANNIE'S HOMEGROWN encloses WHITE cheddar, for a slightly different taste. Yes, there are a few other white cheddar brands out there, but again, check the box. This one really is healthier for you.<br /><br />So before you pick up the store generic or any other brand, you might want to take just a little time to read the package. You will find this one more impressive.<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.

review/summary: The best spackle I ever received...
review/text: Another astute reviewer below referred to the "chalky" consistency of this "homegrown" brand of mac and cheese.  Casting aside the "growing" abilities of mac and cheese for a moment, let me say that that reviewer was being extremely gracious and diplomatic.  To call this "chalky" is call Metamucil, well, "grainy."  It's the understatement of understatements.<br /><br />Rather than use this for its intended purpose...which I truly fear for those who actually ingest this substance...I noticed how well it clumped and gumped up together.  Taking it out to a storage shed with interior yellowish walls, I began hoisting a putty knife to this travesty of a "pasta" and...lo and behold...it plugged up holes in the best way possible.  Now, slap a touch up of paint over it...voila.  Thank's Annie's.<br /><br />So...as a food-substance....Jesus, Joseph and Mary, I would have to pass.  But, as an industrial-strength spackle or bonding-agent...go for it.

review/text: I know that truffle aroma can be either overwhelming or subtle.  People who aren't used to truffles might find it hard to notice their unique scent.  Others want to stay far away from truffles.<br /><br />I'm in the middle.  I can certainly taste them and I certainly enjoy them as an accompaniment to the appropriate foods.<br /><br />The La Tourangelle is too subtle for my taste.  It's expensive, and for that price, it seems that they can try to infuse more truffle essence into the oil.<br /><br />It was difficult deciding whether to give this product two or three stars.  It deserves two stars for its execution, but three stars for trying.<br /><br />I will be trying some others; hopefully I can point readers in another direction.<br /><br />---<br />Update as of 11/23.  I did try another truffle oil...La Truffiere from JR Mushrooms and specialities.  The JR version was so good that I lowered my review of this one (La Tourangelle) to two stars from three stars.  I gave the La Truffiere four stars.  For my details, see the review for La Truffiere.

review/summary: Don't waste your $$
review/text: I purchased this oil as I was thrilled that a local grocer actually carried it.  It was a 20.00 bottle.  What a waste of money.  There is so little truffle flavor that you end up using way more than what is normal.  Now, someone who hasn't been in the kitchen for too long might think that this is "wonderful" but no..Don't buy..End of story

review/summary: Yuck! Save your money, and buy something else!
review/text: I don't want to mince words. This stuff is awful.(Did not purchase at Amazon, rather at the local Unsafeway during a frantic holiday rush, when.. WHAT??? WE ARE OUT of truffle oil? People are coming over early! What are we going to do? Our local fave store was closed by then, so off I went...)<br />Anyway.<br />Trust me, you do not want to end up with over 16 oz of this stuff. (I only had 1 bottle to go through, and that took a while!) I didn't want to throw it out, but I didn't want to use it, so there it sat. Ugh. Never. Again.<br /><br />I am not pretending to be a "golden nosed" truffle expert. But I am savvy in the kitchen, and I can tell you what smells and tastes good, what adds to dishes, and what does not.<br /><br />Truffle oil is expensive, but necessary for pasta and risotto. But, like certain kinds of salt, or olive oil, or vinegar, it is a "finishing" product, one that should be added at the very end for that final flavor spike, just before plating.<br /><br />My advice would be to buy a higher quality product, and use it sparingly- with truffle oil, a little goes a long way. (But with this product, the flavor was weak and flat- I couldn't get that heady 'truffle punch", as I call it, no matter how much I wasted.)<br /><br />I recommend S. Tartufi truffle oil, but I am open to recommendations, should anyone reading this be especially in love with theirs.<br />Lemme know! Thanks, and I hope this helped.

review/summary: There is NO actual truffle used in the making of this product
review/text: This is an extremely deceptive practice. They do everything they can on the label to make you think that there is truffle used to make this product. There isn't. The "truffle essence" in the product is a chemical compound made in a laboratory to mimic the smell of real truffles. Hello, Food and Drug Administration--I thought one of your jobs was to make sure that labels are very clear and understandable for consumers!!!!! Is allowing companies to write "essence" when that means that it is a synthetically created chemical in keeping with your department's policies. Shame on La Tourangelle and shame on the FDA.

review/summary: Loses "truffle-iness' over time.
review/text: When I first purchased this (and the white) truffle oil, they added very nice flavor to pizzas, pastas etc. Several months later, neither had any truffle aroma or flavor remaining.<br /><br />Most truffle oils don't aren't infused with real truffles, but with a chemical compound instead. My guess is that if you find a fairly fresh oil, you will be pleased but be aware they seem to have a short shelf life.

review/summary: A counter to the negative reviews
review/text: I can't comment on the flavor since I just bought it yesterday. I gave this 5 stars only to counterbalance the incorrect 1-star reviews regarding the ingredients.<br /><br />This oil is an INFUSED oil, made with truffle extract.  Not an 'aroma', not an 'essence' and not made with "2,4-dithiapentane" and other chemicals.  Extract is made by putting truffles in oil to make a very strong flavor and then using the over-strong results in something else.  Like vanilla extract - that stuff is NASTY when tasted straight from the bottle, but magical when added sparingly to other dishes.<br /><br />My tin has only 2 ingredients listed and the lable says "Infused".  The 2 ingredients are Organic Sunflower Oil and Black Truffle Extract.  That's it.  The tin keeps light out much better than a darkened bottle (or a clear one!).  It's also sold locally at Whole Foods and Bristol Farms.<br /><br />I'll review later after I've actually tasted it.  But I look very carefully at labels before purchasing items like this.  La Tourangelle is one of the few that has no other junk added.

review/summary: American vs. Canadian and how to tell...
review/text: Just my opinion and based on my reading up on Red Rose...<br />What we get in the U.S. now is not the same great Red Rose we used to get in the 1970's/early 80's. The company broke up it's operations between Unilever and Redco (?) and the difference is the Canadian version is Orange Pekoe Black and Pekoe Black cut teas with the American version just Black cut tea and Black Pekoe cut tea.  The difference is very noticeable as the original great aromatic flavor with that great after taste is gone. What we get in the U.S. is more like the Australian "Billy Tea" (also made by Red Rose, U.S.); in short, a stronger version of Lipton. Kinda bland.<br />But I have found the Unilever version at my local WalMart and so far every box has been just like the Red Rose of old I remember as a young man! I'm very happy with it!  Most of the time I drink either PG Tips or Brooke Bond Red Seal and love them to death; but I still love my old Red Rose of my youth and am glad I found it again.  I don't know how long this will last; could have been a fluke or a purchase from an over stock issue...you never know with WalMart, but as long as I can find the original/Canadian blend I'm buying it.  So check for which company makes/distributes it and if you find Unilever on the label buy that one!

review/summary: Still the best little tea bag this side of the pond
review/text: I find this to be the perfect blend for morning or afternoon tea. It also makes the best iced tea you can have.<br /><br />I have drunk Red Rose for over thirty years and living in different places has made getting it quite difficult - thank goodness for friends who would ship it to us.<br /><br />Red Rose is a lovely blend of Black and Orange Pekoe teas. It is a smooth flavor which is refreshing and also soothing at the same time. It does not have the harshness or "bite" that so many teas have. It does not have added blends or flavors so what you get is a nice, straight-forward cup of tea.<br /><br />It makes a lovely spiced tea - put some Cloves, a stick of Cinnamon, and the rind of half an Orange in a pot with the correct number of tea bags for the pot. Steep for at least six minutes. Add honey to your cup and enjoy!

review/summary: a wonderful black tea that brings back memories....
review/text: I have fond memories of drinking Red Rose Tea with my Mother, from the time I was a little girl. Of course, one of the reasons I especially enjoyed it was the free porcelin doll inside. Usually, it was either some type of animal or a circus performer. This was just an added bonus, to drinking it. We would usually serve it with a splash of milk and a plate of graham crackers. This tea has a wonderful, clean black tea flavor - like you are drinking straight from the plant. I can't explain it better than that. It just tastes so pure. I am no aficianado, but, I know good tea when I taste it, and ain't nothin' like the real thing baby. I am going to go drink a cuppa, now.....

review/summary: Best Everyday Hot tea
review/text: I have had nothing but Red Rose growing up near the Canadian Border in the US. I have drank it for over 40 years and in my opinion nothing compares to it. I live in Indiana now and was able to get it at a local grocer much to my happiness but recently they quit selling it and I had to go home to Niagara Falls Ny to get it. I just noticed you sell it, (yea) and it should be much cheaper now getting it from you seeing gas prices are so high and the casino there cost me also dearly..lol so who cares what shipping cost right? Please continue to sell it. Thanks

Therefore I appreciate locating original flavor Red Rose tea on Amazon.com. It's always time for a sip of refreshing Red Rose original tea.

review/summary: The Rub You Crave
review/text: I was given the 3-pack by a friend of mine and I have to say that this person is definitely my best friend for life. I should begin by stating that I LOVE chicken wings - I try them everytime I see them on a menu. Since trying these rubs, however, especially the Finger Lickin', I just can't bring myself to try them any place else.  The rub is perfectly spicy, perfectly smoky and leaves you craving more. We grill up these bad boys at least once a week in our household, but I have also marinated whole chickens, spiced up some grilled shrimp and even added to popcorn. AMAZING. The levels of heat are, shall we say, pretty extreme. The Easy Pickin' is for those of you that like a teeny-tiny amount of heat in your dishes (think poblano), Finger Lickin' for those a little more adventuresome (think jalapeno) and for those of you that ski the Black Diamonds, well, you really should try What Was I Thinkin' (think Ghost Pepper, times 4). The first bite I took made me kinda giggle like, hey, I got this. I defeat you Ghost Pepper. Then....it....hit. I have never sweated, cried and guffawed all at the same time. It was, truly, an unreal experience and I'm ever so grateful I tried it.<br /><br />I sure hope you give these a shot. You will truly be impressed with the flavor sensations!!!
