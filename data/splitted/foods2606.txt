review/summary: Great 100 Calorie Treat!!
review/text: I loved the original Oreo Cakesters when they first debuted. But, I shied away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving. So, when I saw the commercial for the 100 calorie version, I could hardly wait to try them, and I must say I am very impressed!<br /><br />While some of the 100 calorie snack cakes can have a dry, mealy consistency, these cakes are moist, decadent and taste 100% like the originals.....just smaller. I would recommend them to anyone who liked the original version, but is watching calories. Good job Nabisco!

review/text: Of all the 100-calorie pack snack products I've tried (and there have been many!) these are my absolute favorites. The funny thing is that I don't even like Oreos, and am not that crazy about chocolate. However, these Thin Crisps are exactly that, thin and crisp. They are also just right to fend off sweet cravings or premature hunger.

review/text: They melt in your mouth!  I think I found my perfect snack.<br />I love Oreos, but hate all the fat they provide to my diet.  By diet I mean the ability to eat everything in moderation.  I monitor how much fat I ingest for many reasons, health being the most important.  One package of these cookies had the same great taste of oreos with only 1/4 of the fat.<br />I also like the fact that they come in individual packages:  They don't go stale;  you can take them on trips, movies, park, etc.<br />Great tea or coffee cookies too!.... and, of course, good old milk.

review/summary: Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?
review/text: I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYEL1A">A Star Is Born</a> the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are "100 Calorie Packs", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.

review/text: Dude, these things are pretty good... as long as you're not bent on them being just like Oreos. I mean, they're not. But I definitely like them better than other chocolate cracker snacks like teddy grahams. The lightness of the crackers makes them perfect for slathering on other goodies, like peanut butter, cream cheese, icing, pudding, melted chocolate...

review/summary: Oreo flavored crackers without the creme filling
review/text: These are great snacks for traveling, such as, by airplane or car.  The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker.  The cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble; and for this reason a preferred treat.<br /><br />The texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat.  The first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is, "Humm these are good!"  This is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time.

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre.

review/text: Who doesn't love Oreo cookies?  Many of us well remember after school snacks of Oreo cookies and milk.  However, also for many of us those school days when we could eat all we wished and not gain an ounce are in the past.  So, it's a special treat that brings back all kinds of good memories to find Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br /> No, I was not one who pulled the cookie apart to lap the frosting, I just loved the chocolatey taste and that is all in these cookies less the unwanted cals. They're crispy, crunchy, chocolate wafers - a wonderful comfort snack.<br /><br /> A high five for Oreo Thin Crisps!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke

review/summary: Delicious Mini Chocolate Treats Help Weight Loss Efforts!
review/text: I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.<br /><br />The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.<br /><br />The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.<br /><br />My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!<br /><br />My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.<br /><br />I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!<br /><br />I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.<br /><br />If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.<br /><br />I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you.

review/text: Since being diagnosed with a gluten sensitivity I have been searching for a gluten-free product to take the place of my long time favorite side, Velveeta Shells and Cheese. This is not it. When we began cooking this product I was very hopeful due to the taste of the noodles, then we added the "Mac & Cheese seasoning". The title alone should have thrown up a red flag, however we felt obligated to try it anyways. I wish I had taken a picture of my face upon tasting this product. It may well have been the most disgusting attempt at a cheese sauce I have ever encountered. After tasting how foul this product was I offered it to my 70lb dog, whom has been known to eat anything; at which time he proceeded to sniff, taste, and walk away. In the almost 2 years I have owned this dog this is the first thing that he has turned down. I strongly suggest paying the extra money to have Annie's Homegrown Creamy Deluxe Macaroni Dinner.

review/text: I prefer raspberry jam but bought the strawberry because it was less expensive.  Since Smuckers makes great raspberry jam, I thought their strawberry jam would be high quality too.  Wrong.  It is overly sweet and sticky.  No strawberry chunks.  It seems like a very cheap product.  I would never buy this again.  Since purchasing this jam, I have read reviews on what to look for in a good jam.  Good quality jam is sweetened with sugar, not corn syrup.  Corn syrup is much cheaper than sugar and tends to make jam too sweet and sticky.  I guess you get what you pay for.

review/text: What I'm about to share is sacred information and shouldn't be shared with just anyone- that's why I'm sharing it on the privacy of amazon.  When I was 8 years old I didn't like strawberry jelly very much.  I preferred grape.  My parents realized my dislike for strawberry jam and bought the grape flavor for most of my childhood instead.  Now don't give me a weird look when I tell you this next part, but even at that young and innocent age I was actually able to predict that the day would come WAY in the distant future when I'd not only welcome the taste of strawberry jelly, but prefer it to the much beloved grape variety.  20 years later... and my premonition came true.  I DO prefer strawberry jam to grape!  I love it now!  It's frightening and mysterious how such a prediction came to be a reality.  However don't be foolish and buy it here on amazon- it's expensive and not worth it.  The store prices are much much cheaper and more dependable.

review/summary: Absolute favorite beverage.
review/text: Arizona Diet Green Tea is my absolute favorite soft drink, and the fact is that I ONLY drink this or water.<br />I will say that nothing is as good as this flavor bought in the GLASS bottles (there's something about the plastic bottles that changes the flavor). However, for cost and convenience, these packets come very close.<br />Other than the great flavor, two things that make this stand out from other sugar free iced tea mixes is that it completely dissolves easily. There is NEVER any residue at the bottom of the bottle, and unlike some other mixes (Crystal Light for example), this doesn't cause acid reflux. That last part may not apply to everyone, but may be important to some (like me).<br />Highly recommended, especially at the subscribe & save price. A friend of mine bragged that she buys these for only $2 a box at Walgreen's, but I noticed that hers only have 8 per box ($0.25 per packet), while these have 10 per box ($0.2485 per packet at the current S&S price), so these are the same.<br />Since Poland Spring bottles go on sale all the time for $3.99 for a case of 24, the total cost for a bottle of Arizona Diet Green Tea is about $0.41. When stores are selling cold 20 oz bottles of soda for $1.50, $0.41 seems pretty inexpensive to me. It's even less if you get your Poland Spring at Costco or some other price club.

review/text: I could no longer find this product locally so I was glad to find it on Amazon.  The drink is refreshing, if you like tea, and are used to drinking sugar free drinks.  Tastes great with meals or as a solo drink.  It arrived well ahead of the estimated shipping date and it was free shipping to boot.

review/text: This stuff is awesome, its full of green tea and taste great. I love that its sugar free and it gives me a mental perk or awareness that I just dont get with other drinks. I also like that you can get a 6 pack, its like carrying 60 bottles of tea in one hand! no dolly, flats or hand trucks needed!!<br /><br />I recommend serving as cold as possible, either over ice or refrigerated water. I use a tornado cup to mix, and it dissolves perfectly.<br /><br />easily will buy this again and again..

review/text: I'm pretty picky about what I like to drink and quit drinking soda regularly over a year ago. Because I need a drink with a little flavor during meals, I used to drink Crystal Light. Until I discovered this, that is. Not overly sweet like some Crystal Light drinks can be, this Green Tea is absolutely amazing! The fact that it's 0 calories, 0 sugar is just icing on the cake!

With subscribe and save, this product not only saves me gas to get to the supermarket but makes a quick and great tasting beverage from plain old water. Recommended.  (Another note: I tried the Arnold Palmer 1/2 and 1/2 sticks and agree with other reviewers that it is not as good as the store bought premix.)

review/text: These "sugar free green tea sticks" are so handy.  I can make 8 ounces of hot or cold Arizona green tea in a few seconds.  Pour the contents of the "stick" into a bottle of cold water if you are out and feel like something more than cold water. Or at home, pour the "stick" into a glass of water and then add ice cubes. Best iced tea I have tasted.

review/summary: Does not stick to your bedpost overnight
review/text: This is the story of a girl...a girl who went through two sets of braces. A girl who spent most of high school unable to chew bubble gum. Before I got the first set of braces, I was a bubble gum fiend. My favorite Easter candy was that little mini egg carton filled with bubble gum eggs. Still is, to be honest. But after two sets of braces and a TMJ surgery, I was firmly broken of the habit of chewing gum. If I'm offered a piece, I take it, but I don't tend to buy it. But when I do, I buy the bubble gum flavor...is there anything better? It's another one of those flavors I associate with childhood and so this brings up all sorts of good memories, even at first whiff. Bubble gum ice cream, does anyone remember that? The rainbow ice cream filled with little gum pieces...it was two treats in one! Two treats that made two separate royal messes! I also broke my nephew of bubble gum at the age of 3 (he's 13 now). I wasn't thinking and his folks said he could have a gumball, so I gave him one of mine. Filled with Shocktart powder. He won't touch the stuff now, ha! I should feel guilty, but I bet his dentist thanks me for it.<br /><br />Anyway, bubble gum has a very fond place in my heart, and it brings up all kinds of memories. It was another of the new matcha flavors that immediately hopped into my cart and I had to try immediately. And I'm so glad I did. It's definitely the bubble gum ice cream of bubble gum flavors, a rainbow of different tastes and flavors, but under the single heading of bubble gum. Generic bubble gum. Not the teeth-rotting super sugary kind, but the Bazooka Joe kind that loses its flavor too quick. Except this tea doesn't lose any of its flavor. Oh gosh, it's good. My brain keeps trying to make me chew the tea, it tastes so much like bubble gum. I wish I had known about this when I was younger! I keep going back for sip after sip. It's taking definite willpower to put it down long enough to write this review! I want to blow bubbles with it. I get the feeling this would make amazing cupcakes, maybe with cotton candy icing. Yum, yum, yum. Definitely a staple in my cupboard.

review/summary: Burn Off the Muffin Top!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FGXPWC">Perfectly Petite Natural Herbal Fat Burning Energy Drink Shot for Women. Weight Loss Solution not a Shake. Full of Antioxidants, Minerals and Vitamins. 6-units</a><br /><br />Perfectly Petite is a stellar way to burn your muffin top to oblivion! As a working mom of three under six years old, and about to attend my 20 year high school reunion, it is important to aid my body in fat burning and appetite suppression. Not to mention helping boost my energy to get through my work day and into the 'Second Shift' at home. So I decided to try this little concoction out.<br /><br />I don't like the thought of consuming a cocktail of fake chemical crap, but I feel confident that it contains more natural ingredients as well as essential vitamins and amino acids. It's sugar free and zero calories. It has given me a steady level of energy and alertness throughout the day and it doesn't give me a headache or crash at the end of the day. Occasionally, I'll feel a slight level of general irritation like some energy drinks can make you feel, but that could just because of fatigue and the typical end-of-day woes.<br /><br />After taking one Perfectly Petite each day for the last month, I've noticed a change in how my clothes fit. My mid-section postpartum inner-tube and saddlebags are looking more slim and I can see some familiar muscle tone peeking through. Of course, working out more rigorously is key in helping this product do its job even better. I don't believe in any miracle weight loss pills, you have to do the hard work to get the weight off and keep it off, but Perfectly Petite is a great partner in the process. I'm down to 120 pounds and not looking to lose much more weight - just tone up the ab-flab.<br /><br />The passion fruit flavor is just okay, but a little too sweet for me. It tastes much better combined in another drink. I've mixed it with apple juice and I've also tried it with green tea. I like it the best with green tea. You can also store it in the fridge and drink it chilled for a better taste.

review/summary: Straightens kinky hair
review/text: I recently started using methi seeds after doing Web research. I cook with the seeds, make tea with the product, and use methi paste on my hair and skin. My hair is very tightly curled, but using methi paste on my hair once or twice a week makes my hair look as if it's been flat ironed (and I never use heat on my hair). If there is a concern about the smell, I simply use strongly fragranced shampoos and conditioners such as Pantene or Suave to neutralize the smell. For me this product works better than any straightening serum I've tried, and I don't anticipate returning to chemical straighteners. Thanks, Mother Nature, for methi!

review/summary: Really Does Keep You Regular
review/text: Why Should You Buy Yogi Get Regular Tea:<br /><br />1)It tastes great!  At first, I was afraid it would have a very bad taste, so I mixed it with Organic India Tulsi Lemon Ginger Tea.  But one day when I was out of the other tea, I ended up drinking it straight.  It was great, smooth and has a slight sweetness to it.<br /><br />2)You can use the teabag 2 or 3 times.  I use my teabag twice.  Not only is this cost effective, but it helps me to go to the bathroom 2-3 times daily.  When you are all done with the teabag, don't throw it away.  Use it as a facial cleanser or toner by gently wiping the teabag all over your face and neck.  It will do wonders for your skin.<br /><br />3)It does keep you regular, but not "runny."<br /><br />4)They have great quotes attached to each teabag.  Not only does the tea keep you regular, but the great quotes attached to each tea bag's label has great quotes.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: If this were truly water resistant, I would have rated it 5 stars.  Much like another review I just read here, as soon as it rained, the light filled up with water.  Mine has not stopped working yet, but I don't see how it can last when filled with water all of the time.  It does do a great job of lighting up the grill at night and I love that I can hit a button and have the light turn on for a small amount of time and then turn itself off.  Again, this would be a highly recommended product if it just resisted water as advertised.

review/summary: Fills with water and stops working
review/text: I received this item as a gift. It says it is water resistant, but the first time it rained, the unit filled up with water. You could see the water sloshing around in it. After draining it still worked if you pushed the button several times... for a couple of months. It always had water in it from every rain. Then it stopped turning on at all. It is also heavy with the batteries installed (not to mention the water it collects.)

review/summary: An excellent desert coffee for the fan of dark roast blends
review/text: I love a full bodied, dark roast coffee when I use my Keurig brewer.  My favorites include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7GYY">Newman's Own Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count, Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>.  However, one of the pleasures of the K-Cup system is that you can easily make a cup of whatever you happen to be longing for at the moment.  A friend of mine, who is very aware of my K-Cup obsession, found this blend, Caribou Coffee's Obsidian at a discount store (Target) and picked up a box for me.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />Aroma: Heady deep chocolate and floral notes with an underlying dark coffee (Kenyan and Ethiopian) aroma<br />Body: A full bodied but smooth blend than feels heavy and rich in the mouth<br />Palate: Bittersweet with chocolate and sweet berry flavors<br />Finish:  Smooth and full without the burnt-bitterness that one sometimes finds in a dark coffee<br /><br />The name "Obsidian" is perfect for this coffee as it is named for a very dark, smooth volcanic glass. I really like this blend and have found it to be the perfect desert coffee for me.  I always drink my coffee black but I found that a little heavy cream really adds to the richness of this blend and makes it the perfect way to end a meal.  This one gets 5 stars from me.

review/summary: Not what it used to be
review/text: Buyer beware. The coffee blend for Obsidian appears to have changed (along with the k-cup packaging).  If you are a first time Obsidian buyer it may not matter to you that the Coffee blend has changed but for me, a faithful Obsidian  coffee drinker, it is a huge disappointment and deal changer.  Until recently, Obsidian k-cups were only available at a certain large chain. Now that they have expanded availability, they seem to have changed the blend/ quality of the coffee.  While the roast remains the same, the bean appears to have changed. No thanks

review/summary: One of the best K Cups, but buy elsewhere!
review/text: If you enjoy dark or "extra bold" K cups, then this is for you. I've tried just about all of the dark and darker K cups, (that I know of),and this is one of the few that I will continually repurchase. That said, this seller is counting on the foolish or uninformed to sell this online, as it is a sub-brand that is unique to Target. (As in the store...) Apparently, Caribou, (who is now owned outright by Green Mountain) created Obsidian specifically for Target, as it is not even mentioned on the Caribou website. Anyway, the "everyday" price $11.99, but it often "on sale" for less - once even $8.99. Just to be fair, I guess you could continue to buy it through Amazon - please note that this is not sold BY Amazon - for more than twice the price. Guess where they, (My Favorite Things, LLC - aka Amazon reseller dejour), are getting it from?

review/summary: Not an expert
review/text: on coffees, I can only tell how it tastes to me and that taste is really fine.  I like arabica bean coffee and the hint of chocolate tops off the real coffee flavor of the Obsidian k cup.  I like a dark roast and strong coffee.  This one fits that requirement.<br /><br />I'm also a tightwad and can use one of the Obsidian k cups with my Keurig B-40 set on the small cup size and get 2 cups of coffee.  I rotate the k cup 90 degrees before the 2nd brewing.<br /><br />Also, either Amazon or Target has a mispricing on the 18 count box of Caribou Coffee Obsidian.  I bought an 18 count box at Target for $9.95 10/05/2010.  This was my 1 st box to try it out.  Glad I did.<br />I use Amazon's subscribe and save program for my coffee so that whatever variety I get will be at the best price.<br /><br />A really good, smooth, dark coffee with an easy flavorful taste.  No bitterness while drinking it nor after drinking.

Target's price for the Obsidian is almost the same as the Dark French Roast I have been receiving from Amazon on subscription (3x50/mo).  Amazon's price of $22.99 for 18 is in the ozone!<br />[[ASIN: B0045S3WR6 $9.95 at Target!]]

review/text: I'm so glad that these are only around at Christmas time or I would gain more weight.  I'm addicted to these soft chewy peppermint candies.  The peppermint is just the right amount candy has a good chew or you can let them melt in your mouth (if you can wait that long)!  I have no complaints except that my bags had many candies that had been smashed causing the candy to squeeze out and stick to the candy next to it.  Didn't slow down the enjoyment.

review/summary: Not so buttery
review/text: I mostly don't like green olives because they are too bitter or too salty. However, Castlevetrano oilves are different. I've first purchased Castlevetrano olives from the olive bar at my local Whole Foods store. I was impressed by the bright color, the minimal amount of saltyness, the minimal amount of bitterness, and the buttery flavor of the Castlevetrano olives that I found at Whole Foods.  The Partanna Castlevetrano olives (reviewed here) were *NOT* as buttery as the Castlevetrano olives that I bought at Whole Foods store.  The Partanna olives taste like they are packed in vinegar, but vinegar is not on the list of ingredients.  These olives are not cheap and I would *NOT* buy the Partanna Castlevetrano oilves again because they don't taste as good as other Castlevetrano olives I've bought elsewhere.

review/summary: Good Tacos, but Some Shells Broke
review/text: Three of the six hard taco shells were chips upon arrival and two of the remaining three had minor damage, so we ended up making taco salad with part of it.  The hard shells tasted great when crisped in the oven as directed.  Soft shell tortillas were fine.  Salsa was minimal quantity, but adequate for tacos (taco salad needed more).<br />Directions -- What You Need: 1 lb lean ground beef; 8 oz. shredded cheddar (or Mexican blend) cheese; Chopped lettuce and tomatoes; and Sour cream  --> it's not a complete meal in a box, but does include: 6 flour tortillas for soft tacos; 6 hard taco shells (see above about breakage); seasoning for the meat; tiny package of salsa; and unsweetended Kool-Aid mix.  You brown the meat, drain, add the water they failed to mention above and the seasoning mix, boil, then simmer 10 minutes.  MEANWHILE, crisp the hard shells in the oven and warm the soft shells (removed from foil packaging) in the microwave.  Total prep time is about 20 minutes.<br />The Tacos were delicious -- must be the special seasoning packet that's included.  At 10 for $25 or so on Subscribe and Save, not a bad deal.

Such a simple dinner, brown some burger, add water and seasoning and you have the base for great tacos. The salsa is quite good, I like mine loaded with lettuce, tomato and sour cream too, you can make it as basic or supreme as you want. My husband took a soft shell, spread some refried beans on it, then wrapped it around a crunchy shell and filled it.

review/summary: Great hearty black tea
review/text: So many black teas (such as pu-erh and yunnan) are so strong and stark, that to find a tea like this (which is assam and ceylon with herbs) is a real treat. First off, make no bones about it, this is a black tea. It has that strong, bitter taste to it that I look forward to from a black tea. However, the aroma is just incredible. Between the cloves and the cinnamon, it's almost as if you've opened up a box of christmas. The tea itself is very rich and very dark. It produces a little froth on its own, mainly I think because the leaves are so broken up. You'll want a very fine filter, there is sediment through the filter we use.<br /><br />The tea itself has a very strong character of both clove and orange, with cinnamon making the tea very much "spicy." Not spicy enough to detract from the rest of the tea, but certainly enough to get your attention. The box mentions there are 3 kinds of cinnamon in the tea as well. This much I'd believe. I know there are at least two kinds -- Sri Lanka and Madagascar -- of cinnamon, it seems reasonable to me that a third might be adding the "sweet" flavor that the other reviewer mentioned.<br /><br />It is really just an amazing tea that I think most people will find themselves going through quickly. It's a nice break from the standard black tea fare, if that's what you normally drink.<br /><br />I can compare it to Rishi Tea's "The Fire" (another "spicy" tea), and the big difference here is the body. Rishi's offering has a very light boody, whereas this tea almost tastes like it's had molasses added. Yum. All the spice, and character to boot.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

The tea is sweet, yet spicy.  According to the Harney literature, the tea contains no sugar, but to taste the tea you will insist that it has sugar in it.  I think the sweet taste comes from the sweet cloves used within the tea.  The aroma is wonderful from the moment the tea is opened.  <p>I must say I was highly impressed with the tea.

review/text: This is by far the best tea I have ever had to drink.  I purchased my first cup at a Barnes and Nobles and could not wait to get home to find the tea on the internet and order.  Try it, if you like cinnamon you will love this tea.  Great hot or cold.

review/summary: To DIE FOR
review/text: End of story.  Hands down one of the best, most well-made teas I have ever tasted.  I have had many Harney and Sons teas as they are famous (as they SHOULD BE!) for the quality and flavor.  The quality is SO incredibly obvious and I enjoy all of them, but this one is truly special.  A regular tea and something I will likely cherish forever.  I am looking forward to purchasing the loose tea in bulk so I can enjoy it for less!  But really, it's worth every penny.  It's quality.  True quality.

review/summary: Fabulous chocolate!
review/text: This is quite possibly the best rich, dark cocoa I have ever used.  I save it for super-special treats--homemade chocolate ice cream, double chocolate cookies, the richest, darkest brownies ever, etc.  Oh, as to the person who did one star review due to size question--my bag is 16 oz, or one pound.

review/summary: Delicious dark cocoa
review/text: This is really a nice, high quality cocoa powder. I've tried several others from Amazon including the Rodelle dark, and this is much better. Dark, rich, intense cocoa taste and dark color.  You can tell just by the color that the cocoa butter concentration is higher.  Highly recommend.  Makes excellent homemade hot chocolate.

review/text: I like it mixed with the barbecue but only just a little bit. I like Cajun seasoning at 5 guys and hoped it would be close it was not.

review/summary: Mix with BBQ on Kettle Corn!
review/text: This stuff is pretty spicy! It makes me sneeze too, but it's great if you mix it with BBQ seasoning on some kettle corn! The sweet, salty, spicy, tangy goodness is amazing!<br /><br />It's great all by itself too, but you'll need a few tissues when your nose starts running.

review/summary: I Love Thai Food!
review/text: I'm in college, so basically I live off ramen noodles. I have tried so many but Mama Tom Yum flavor is my all time favorite instant noodle! If you like Thai food at all, you will go crazy for these noodles. They are so yummy!<br /><br />Each packet comes with noodles (of course) which are not too soft but not too firm when boiled. Then there is one packet that is split by a divider. One side has the fish sauce. The other side has the tom yum spices. These three mixed together literally give one of the most authentic Thai flavors ever! I love how Thai food has a limey zest to it!<br /><br />This is so great I can't even tell you, you have to try it. The preparation is simple, I just boil noodles and add the two mixes. It literally takes less than 5 minutes to prepare. I do not add eggs or other veggies because I just love the taste alone. I imagine it would not taste as good with an egg though. This is the only noodle I must always have stocked in my college apartment kitchen.<br /><br />Slight warning: Contains MSG in pretty high quantities last time I checked, so I only eat this once or twice a week. Moderation is key with most ramen noodles, since basically all have no nutritional value at all.

review/summary: Quite good
review/text: I never had Tom Yum anything up until I tried this. It's very spicy, and just a bit sour.<br />A very good combination. I can't wait to try the real thing some day.
