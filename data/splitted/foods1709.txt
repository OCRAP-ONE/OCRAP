review/text: If you want to kick the coffee habit, it will be easier with Pero.<br />Pero is caffeine free, but still gives that satisfying feeling of a hot drink.  My husband drank Pero every evening instead of eating supper, and lost 60# in about 8 months. My seven children love Pero, too; they use creamer and sugar, and it is delicious.

review/summary: Great warm beverage alternative
review/text: I've never been a coffee drinker, so I can't speak to Pero's comparison to coffee. However, when I want a rich, warm drink with fewer calories, Pero is the choice to beat hot chocolate. I add some non dairy creamer or milk, and just a bit of honey, and it really hits the spot without the overly sweet and high calorie count of hot chocolate. Hard to find in stores now, and Amazon's price is good (especially with Amazon Prime!).

review/summary: From a Postum-Lover
review/text: So this morning I treated myself to a little of my meager store of Postum. It almost made me cry, it was so good. So I went on a rampage, searching the web for any news about Postum since my last one around a year ago. Finally I broke down.<br /><br />My mom bought a can of Pero when she found out that Postum was discontinued and she hated it and it's been sitting on our pantry shelf ever since. I finally decided to try it this afternoon.<br /><br />My verdict: if you are desperate for Postum, it's really not bad. It tastes very close to Postum, although there's more barley flavor/smell to it. I think I'll start drinking this as I slowly whittle away my Postum supply.<br /><br />I'm a Mormon, so I don't drink coffee or tea, and sometimes I find myself desiring a drink more mature-tasting than hot chocolate. Pero satisfies the craving. Postum was better. Since I grew up drinking it. Try it before you turn your nose up at it.

review/text: Pero is an excellent substitute for coffee.  My father has been drinking it for years.  The product is awesome, however, when he received the package, 4 out of 6 canisters were broken open during shipping.  He is elderly, 88 years of age, and to him it was to much of an inconvience to repackage everything and return them to the post office and ship them back so he obsorbed the loss.  That was disheartening for me since I live several hours away and could not be there to help.  Product good shipping was very bad.

review/summary: Great alternative to coffee
review/text: I have been drinking a lot of coffee and happened to find this product. I wanted to reduce the caffeine but still get a hot comforting low calorie drink. The aroma of the Pero did not match that of coffee but, I tried it anyway. I mixed a cup and found it not as good as as my coffee but, tried it for awhile then decided to go back to my coffee. Having run out of coffee, I took the jar of Pero from the shelf and decided to try it again. This time I read the directions. Now who would think one needs to read directions to make a cup of hot drink? My error. I mixed the Pero with one HEAPING tsp. of Pero instead of my normal level measure method. What a difference! I'm converted, and the Pero had been sitting on my coffee shelf for about a month since I first opened it!

review/summary: Good caffeine-free beverage, but not robust/flavorful enough
review/text: This product is decent if you're looking for a light caffeine-free beverage.  It does have a strong aroma (nutty) but no matter how much powder I use, the color, flavor and texture is still very light.  I like my coffees and teas to look and taste strong (regardless of the caffeine level) so I always feel a bit disappointed at the first few sips.  But considering what it is, it's good enough. I like to have this in the early evenings in the winter when I want a hot beverage without the caffeine. I wouldn't recommend buying this in bulk unless you've tried it first.  Also, if you can buy Postum anywhere, get that instead.  It's much better.

review/text: This is the best coffee alternative that I have found so far. I love a hot cup of coffee but due to the negative effects on my health I had to find a substitute. I tried different teas but it wasn't the same. Then I remembered Pero from my childhood and looked for it in the stores. And I'm so glad I found it, it's an excellent coffee replacement. It has a very mild flavor similar to coffee, but unlike coffee it doesn't have a bitter aftertaste. I like mixing it with hot milk and it almost tastes like real coffee. Love it, I don't even miss coffee anymore!

I put about 2 inches of Pero in a 4 cup French Press with 1 Tbsp of expresso (or your favorite fair trade coffee) add hot water. When it has "brewed" I add about 1/3 organic half and half to 2/3 coffee. It tastes like malted expresso - yum. And I really love this mix cold. Pero is a bit more reasonably priced than other coffee substitutes (especially ordered auto ship) and tastes as good.

review/summary: Pero, Inka, Cafix review...
review/text: I bought a case of all three products, Inka, Pero and Cafix in order to compare them. Honestly? They are all the same, so go with whatever is the cheapest. I think I did like Cafix the best, but it may be a mental thing with the name at least sounding somewhat like Coffee. There is little difference in all three, they look identical with only tiny coloration differences. All by themselves they do not taste like coffee and if you are a black coffee drinker? Pass, because you will not be satisfied with the taste. It is very bland all by itself. BUT, if you like cream in your coffee? You won't even notice the difference between coffee and these products within a week or two you will forget you are not drinking coffee. I am PERFECTLY happy with all three products and will continue to drink them;I will choose by PRICE due to the very similar make of them all. The cans all read the same ingredient wise.

review/text: Pero is a grain base "substitute" for those who are trying to quit coffee or just want a very nice hot drink. It's good on its own, but my favorite way to fix Pero is to make a "double" cup's worth with two heaping teaspoons of Pero, one heaping teaspoon of cocoa powder, Stevia to taste, and a small pinch of salt (try it with and without - you will taste the difference). Sometimes I also add a pinch of cinnamon. Especially nice in the morning and evening, but I drink it whenever.<br /><br />Amazon.com has the best price on the web.

review/summary: I love Pero
review/text: This is a good replacement for people who want to eliminate coffee from their diet. I like having warm drinks but hot chocolate and other beverages that need to be sweetened do not satisfy me like Pero. I can sweeten it to my taste and it has the full-bodied flavor that doesn't need sweetening. I will recommend it to all my over-caffeinated friends and family.

review/summary: Pero - Great!
review/text: I have been looking for a substitute for Postum since they stopped making it.  I read a lot of reviews on what people were switching to and this seemed to be the best choice.  BOY WAS IT! My family and I love it!<br />Great taste, mixes up well and doesn't give you the upset stomach that Postum sometimes did. We highly recommend it!

review/summary: Great coffee substitute!
review/text: We have always been die-hard fans of Postum.  Which is a defunct product since 2007.  We tried this in Utah, but we can't find it in the midwest.  We have even made a Latte-style (cold or hot)drink with this.  A good word of advice always start with boiling water--it doesn't mix well if you add milk first.  We are pleased with taste and "texture" of this substitute.  It also stores very well in mylar storage bags for long-term storage!<br /><br />Thank you so much for a great product!<br />rakoons

review/text: I WANT to prefer Green Mountain above all others...great customer service, small company makes it big, company with 'heart' and fair trade....howevahhhhhhh:<br />I have to agree with the other reviewer that prefered Timothy's Breakfast blend. After tasting most of the GM inventory, I would call 'Nantucket Blend' a Breakfast blend, sadly this would be 'Breakfast Bland'. Why 4 stars? This is MOST excellent if you like to add your OWN frills! Whipped milk, dusted with cocoa and cinnamon, maybe a dash of Bailey's or a peppermint stick...a good starter that will let you create your own nuance.

review/summary: Weak, bland, blech... and I just started drinking coffee
review/text: Just started drinking coffee after 36 years and I feel so strongly about how uninteresting and weak this stuff is that I feel compelled to give my 2 cents.<br /><br />It seems even though I'm a newbie I like it strong and black.  I like the Donut Shop.  At work I like coffee that coats the teeth a bit.  I know, gross.<br /><br />There's just nothing going on here.  Little taste.  Little aroma.  If you make a small cup it's a bit better.  In short, if you genuinely like black coffee that tastes like coffee don't get this.<br /><br />If you like it weak, or as others have said you just need a base for a fluffy drink (which is cool) then I guess this would work.

I would definitely recommend people to give this one a try. You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: WOW!
review/text: I'm a little late to the whole chai game. It seems like I'm the last person to try chai. It was a slow process. A couple of years ago, I was trying to find a brand and flavor of tea that I could really enjoy. I'm not a coffee drinker and always felt left out that I couldn't seem to enjoy a relaxing, warm beverage. I'm a lover of all things coconut and during my tea-buying spree, I found a box of Celestial Seasonings Sweet Coconut Thai Chai and promptly bought it. I also purchased another CS tea called Honey Vanilla Chamomile. I tried the chai once, but since I really didn't know how to prepare chai, I thought it was ok, but didn't go back to it. On the other hand, I immediately fell in love with the Honey Vanilla Chamomile and couldn't live without it. After a while, I was cleaning out my tea cabinet and decided to give away all of the teas I had amassed (except of course for my beloved Honey Vanilla Chamomile) and decided to hang onto the Sweet Coconut Thai Chai just because it was coconut. A few days ago, I decided to try to make it with some warm milk and Sugar in the Raw. I was absolutely blown away! Overnight, I went from zero to Chai fanatic. It seems that if I am a fan of a product, it's a sign that the item will surely be discontinued. Because it had been two years, I was afraid that CS may have stopped producing the Sweet Coconut Thai Chai, and I held my breath as I browsed their website. Thankfully, it is still produced and while on the site, I decided to see what other flavors they make. That's when I saw it--I literally gasped out loud when I saw that Celestial Seasonings makes a Honey Vanilla Chai! Oh my! It couldn't be...my all-time favorite hot tea was also a chai! I rushed out the next day(yesterday) and grabbed up a box and came home to make it. All I can say is WOW! This stuff is amazing! Please, Celestial Seasonings, don't EVER stop making this!

review/summary: If you love Starbucks Vanilla Chai...
review/text: I bought this tea over a year ago, when the vanilla chai latte's were becoming fashionable at Starbucks.  I was at a Starbuck's inside of my local Kroger and asked for a Vanilla Chai Latte.  She said, oh you mean a Chai Tea (bag) with a shot of vanilla & steamed milk.  I looked at her kind of strange.  She said, great, I'll get it for you right away.  She rang it up and it was half of the price that I normally pay.  Well, she put a Chai Tea bag in my cup, put a shot of vanilla on top of it and poured water up to 3/4 of the cup and topped it off with steamed milk.  She told me to give it a few minutes, a stir and I should be ready to go. To my surprise, with a tsp of sugar, it tasted exactly like its more expensive counterpart.  I did the rest of my shopping and before I checked out, I went back to the young lady and said, thank you for showing me another way to make my favorite drink, can I buy those tea bags in here?  She said that the tea bags that Starbucks use, are kind of pricey, but that she tried the one by Celestial Seasonings "Honey Vanilla Chai," and it was the closest to our beloved drink. Well, that was the beginning of the love affair with me and this tea.  I usually steep it with hot water and top it with either half&half or just milk with 1 tsp of sugar (I've also tried a tsp of honey which is equally as good).  I had not drank any of it in a while and went to the pantry to make me a cup the other day... well, my husband has been in my last package and left 1 tea bag (you know men) and we have looked all over the place and cannot find it locally anymore.  Thanks Amazon for making this available to me... and what a deal, especially knowing that I have two drinkers in this house instead of one.  Thanks again!

review/text: I am no tea connoisseur, but I still have a working taste bud that finds this tea to be on the bitter side. I was expecting it to be a bit sweet due to the "honey" but I was a bit disappointed on that part. Although it suggests to add some milk to make it sweet, I may not have milk readily available at work, so I expect it to be ready to drink I guess. This is actually my first review ever on Amazon, so I guess I really need to point out the bitterness, but it's not bad, just not the best!

review/summary: If you love chai, you have to try this
review/text: This in my opinion is the most perfect chai. The white tea gives it a very delicate flavor, the honey is subtle yet noticeable and the chai spices are bold but not overpowering. It's great as is, or with sweetened condensed milk or of course with an extra splash of honey and soy or regular milk. We've served this to many friends and relatives and quite a few of them are now hooked. I've not found any other white tea chai but the celestial seasonings white chai has definitely replaced all other chais in my cupboard, it's simply the best in my opinion.

review/summary: Heaven in the morning
review/text: I cannot start my morning without this tea.  I used to buy it from Meijer for several years but they stopped selling this variety.  I don't know why because it is sublime.  Thank you Amazon.com for<br />having it available.  I've been buying it here for about 2 years. I usually get it with free S&H when I buy several cases.  It is the best tea I've ever tasted; not too spicy, with just the right amount of vanilla.  I recommend it to anyone who would like a lovely warm morning tea.  Great with a little milk and sugar.

review/summary: Celestial Seasonings Honey Vanilla Chai - Perfect
review/text: Chanced upon a box of this tea in Target many months ago, then couldn't find it again anywhere, Target or otherwise. Finally I had to go for Amazon, which as always thus far, came through! In fact, paid less than buying it from store. This chai tea is amazing, perfectly harmonized taste of chai and mild taste of honey vanilla sweetness.

review/summary: LOVE IT
review/text: I have been drinking this tea for a while now.  My all time favorite.  It is heavenly.  Not too spicy, just enough to taste it in there somewhere mixed with the vanilla and honey.  Just know that I do use a huge mug and 2 tea bags.<br />I screwed up by substituting it with Twinings Indian Spiced Chai Tea because it's available at the market and it tasted good once when my husband tried making iced chai with it.<br />I don't know why it tasted good enough for me to think I could substitiute, if it was the brewing process: we let 5 tea bags boil a bit in the pot.  I reheated some in the microwave and drank that.  But I am happy I'm almost done with that order.<br />I also tried the Spiced Chai and Double Spiced Chai from Stash as I said in a previous review I would. Very spicy.  Too spicy for my taste.

review/text: I love this tea and now it is getting very hard to find in the stores.  I am so glad it is available through Amazon. This one is very good with a clean refreshing taste with a lot of different flavoring to it. I sweeten it with just a bit of honey and it taste great hot or cold. I will continue to buy it through Amazon since the price is much better and it gets delivered.  What could be easier?

review/summary: Very good Chai but can't taste the honey
review/text: I am trying this tea for the first time. I tried the original Chai Indian spice tea yesterday and fell in love with Chai tea! I cannot taste any difference between this tea and the original Indian Spice tea. I just had a cup of each back-to-back to be sure and they taste exactly the same! I know the original has vanilla in it but no honey. I do not add any sugar or anything else to my tea and I cannot taste the honey. This tea is excellent for sure and you cannot go wrong with any of the Celestial Seasonings Chai teas, but if you are looking for a different flavor then the original try the Chocolate Enhanced tea- very good and so sweet and slightly milder then this one in terms of Indian spices and black pepper flavors. Still a wonderful tea with the health benefits of White tea and Black tea!

The flavor went well with milk, sugar, half and half, French Vanilla or just...BLACK.  A subtle hint of coconut after each sip was refreshing and light.  This is a perfect coffee.  Thank You, Wolfgang.  You're Jamaican Me Crazy.

review/summary: Water is Cheaper
review/text: I have ordered this brand before in the Rodeo Drive flavor. Good stuff. I have also loved pure Blue Mountain Jamaican coffee and this was not even close. These KCup pods are producing watery coffee with each serving. Clearly they are defective. To add to this, it took a week for the product to even ship. I contacted the seller who then pushed me over to Amazon about the delay in shipping. I cannot return these miserable coffee pods, so got stuck with them at MY cost.

review/summary: An excellent Brew
review/text: I have owned my Keurig machine since Chritmas and have tried about 40 flavors of coffee that they have. Amazon has the best price most of the time unless you find a store close to you that is running<br />a sale.  My work just got a Keurig machine and had some samples of this Jamaica Me Crazy for us to try along with many other flavors.  I have to say that the Jamaica Me Crazy is some of the best tasting coffees that are offered.  The boldness is perfect and the mix of tropical flavor is amazing!  After sampling some at work, I immediately got online and ordered my own box to have at home.  I love my Keurig Machine and the great variety it offers me! I recomend this system for all coffee lovers.

review/summary: Filling isn't great, but the cupcakes are still tasty
review/text: I got these on sale/with coupons so I figured I give them a try.  I bought both the chocolate and vanilla varieties and they both come with the white marshmellow type filling.  I've made plenty of cupcakes, but these were a bit tricky b/c you have to put a small amount of cupcake mix in the bottom, then you squeeze the filling in, and finally you have to cover the filling with some more of the mix.  The box says the mix/filling will make 12 cupcakes, but I found it made about 8 average sized (full to the top when baked) and 4 smaller (only half of the height to the rim when baked).  The cupcakes themselves come out moist and have a good flavor, but the filling seems a bit strange b/c it's marshmellow and not creamy-which I don't really care for, but if you love marshmellows, you'll probably enjoy it.  Overall, these are not that great and aren't too complicated to make, but do require a bit of finesse when it comes to batter distribution. I would say skip them and go with regular old cupcakes :)

After further examination it seems the bugs come inside hte box. Today I opened a new one only to find it full of bugs to, I threw them all away and probably wont purchase again. I dont urge you to stop buying the product but rather check it thoroughly before giving it to your dog. If it does contain bugs contact the company and tell them where you bought it.

review/summary: Medium Sized Treat, Big Yummy Taste
review/text: Milkbone Original Crunchy Treats / B000EBKSCU<br /><br />My puppy just loves these Milkbone treats. Though the box says "Great for Training", they are a bit too big for proper treat training (which involves slicing the treats very thinly so that the dog doesn't get satiated or fattened up) because the treats are very hard and cannot be easily sliced into smaller pieces.<br /><br />However, they are uniquely good for training "Leave It!" - I can drop it on the floor and the puppy immediately notices the smell and comes over to investigate. And if he decides to ignore my "Leave It!" command, the treat is big enough and hard enough that it survives in his mouth long enough for my to reach in and grab it and start over - no rewards for ignoring "Leave It!", or he'll ignore it always. After only a few weeks of training, "Leave It!" is well-understood and almost always obeyed, thanks to these yummy Milkbones.<br /><br />Also, since these are larger and more satisfying that his usual treats, he also gets these at crate time. When Mommy says "Crate!" that means he snuggles into his crate and waits anxiously for his Milkbone treats. He absolutely adores them, and loves gobbling them up happily.<br /><br />These came carefully packed from Amazon with no shipping problems. The bulk price on Amazon is much cheaper than anything I've found locally and much more convenient.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/text: This pack of six boxes is a great bargain.  Although I've been trying to buy more nutritional and healthy treats, I still keep a stash of these because my dog likes them.  I would be happier though if the manufacturer didn't use artificial coloring, and I'm somewhat suspicious of the little pieces of hair I've seen embedded in the "marrow" part.  I haven't seen any bugs that other reviewers have mentioned.
