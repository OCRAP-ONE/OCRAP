review/summary: Okay Creamer and Okay Packaging...
review/text: I bought this brand of French Vanilla creamer because it was cheaper than my usual brand (Coffee Mate French Vanilla Single Serve Creamers) but, I don't think I'll buy these again unless there's a significant difference in price. In comparison to the Coffee Mate (in my opinion) the French Vanilla flavor feels more artificial and has a very slight aftertaste....nothing too bothersome though. Overall, it is still a good creamer, I just prefer the Coffee Mate version. However, for the hazelnut flavor, I do prefer the International Delight version over all everything else.<br />As for the packaging, like the other reviewers, there seemed to have been a leak in one of the cups and so a few of them were sticky and had a crust-like thing on them. But for me, it wasn't a big mess (it really did seem like just ONE cup leaked) and so it wasn't a big deal for me.

review/summary: Failed on delivery, AWESOME on customer service
review/text: I ordered the French Vanilla, the only creamer I ever like. Unfortunately, before my item was shipped, Amazon put the item under review and sent me Hazelnut. YUCK!  I was refunded the money, thankfully, but was told that I could reorder after the item was no longer being reviewed. As I spoke to the Amazon representative, I checked the item and saw that the price had increased. Amazon customer service took care of me and I was completely satisfied by the time I got off the phone. I got a refund for the item AND I'll be getting a replacement item once it becomes available.  THANK YOU AMAZON. Although this means I'll be stuck w/ more powered creamer or Starbucks until my creamer comes in.

review/text: I am a person who has NEVER drank tea.  I've tried many different teas and have never liked any.  I also have moderate stomach issues so thought I'd try this tea.  I will admit it took me a couple cups of tea to get hooked, but once I did I found the taste wonderful and the calming effect on my stomach is a big help.  I drink one cup every night after dinner.  If I'm away from home I bring some tea bags with me.

review/summary: It Works
review/text: I've been drinking Yogi teas for a couple of years now.  Just happened upon it at a health food store and wanted to try it.  The medicinal Yogi Tea line is fantastic.  It does exactly what the box says it will do... which is strange because I have tried many medicinal teas that have not given me any type of immediate or noticable results.  I can have a tummy ache, drink a 6-8 oz cup of Yogi Stomach ease and half way through the cup my stomach ache is gone.  The same goes for their bedtime tea:  once I drink a cup I can lay down, close my eyes and I'm out cold and in a deep/restful sleep.  This stuff is way better than the supermarket celestial seasonings line.  Twinnings or Traditional Medicinals don't compare either.  One important thing to be aware of regarding the Yogi line:  these teas are spicy and heavy.  Many of them have spices like cardimom, cinnamon, black licorice root, stevia leaf... some even have black pepper listed as an ingredient... they're loaded, but oh so good!!

review/summary: Yogi Stomach Ease
review/text: As a person that had gastric bypass years ago, I constantly had problems with smelly gas. It didn't matter what I ate, I always had it. Recently I have had symptoms of IBS with extreme gas and bloating. I looked about 8 months pregnant by the end of the day. I went looking all over the internet to find some remedies. I bought this tea at a local store and I am utterly amazed. My gas and bloating issues, which were quite severe, are completely gone...and I mean COMPLETELY. I'm not super fond of the taste but it's not too bad and even if it was, I'd still be drinking it for the awesome results!

review/text: This is one of the most amazing things in the world for people who suffer from stomach problems.  The name Stomach Ease is really right on the money because it quickly eases stomach discomfort.<br /><br />The ingredients are a little intimadating for sure!  I'm not a fan of black licorice at all, and that nearly stopped me from buying this.  The taste is interestingly strong, it's not something I had ever tasted before.  The flavor of the tea is like notes in a harmony because you are noticing many different flavors that make a wonderful combined taste.  To say that it quickly grows on you wouldn't be far off from the mark.<br /><br />It's a wonderful product - that I recommend to anyone with issues with their stomach.  Give it a chance you will not be disappointed!

We use this on an almost daily basis sometimes and this amazon price can't be beat, though not by much, it can't be beat even with sale prices that we've found.  So, if you buy more than $25 worth you get free shipping :)  This tea tastes great too!

review/summary: Works, even for the worst nausea (including morning sickness)!
review/text: A few years ago, my wife was on a new medication that would make her sick all the time.  We were on vacation and she was in our room throwing up all day.  I walked over to the Whole Foods next door to see if I could find anything that might make her feel any better, when I stumbled upon this while just looking around the tea aisle.  I'm not really much of a natural remedies kind of guy and don't worship crystals... but this just seemed to be too much of a coincidence.  I had to try...!  I made her some back at the room and she felt much better in just a few minutes!  Over the following months, I would make her a cup whenever she was feeling badly.  It really worked!<br /><br />Later, over the years, we recommended or gave this to friends and acquaintances struggling with nausea.  We gave it to one lady who was pregnant and having awful morning sickness.  It worked so well for her, she went right out and bought her own supply!<br /><br />This week, my wife is sick again and we ran out. I couldn't find any locally!  I checked Amazon and found this six pack to be way cheaper then the $4.99 per box I typically would pay.  It arrived quickly and my wife is feeling much better.

review/text: After living in New Mexico for 4 years, the green chili withdrawal was BRUTAL! The canned version of anything is never as good as getting it fresh, but this brand is far superior to anything available locally where we're living now and the small can is perfect for a 2-person household.

review/text: The bonsai itself is fine.  You cannot immediately tell it's artificial.  It just looks like a healthy little tree.  That being said, I have pretty much an exact identical from a set of three I also purchased online here.  I could have bought another set of three with the money I paid for this one.  The picture used makes it look like a larger bonsai and is clearly not the one you receive.  Live and learn.

review/summary: Spicy & Satisfying
review/text: This veggie jerky is fantastic!  The Hot & Spicy is my favorite, but all are pretty good too.  While it's true there is a bit less protein in this variety, there is significantly more fiber (6g vs. 1g for soy protein based flavors).  Note: there's a definite spice here, it's not overwhelming, but it's definitely there... as the flavor implies.

review/summary: not so high protein
review/text: This is not really a high protein snack. Too bad I missed the link to the nutrional values - only 6 grams of protein. The other primal strips have 10 and are better textured. But if you can't have wheat, this one's mainly mushrooms. Also the free shipping takes forever and the prices have go up make them close to the store cost where I live.

review/summary: Too salty, strange flavor
review/text: I found this flavor of Primal Strips Spicy & (Hot Mushroom) to be one of the most salty foods I have ever tasted! It was an overwhelming salt taste and this flavor is just not for me. I could not eat more than one. This brand's Teriyaki flavor is better. The "jerky" is a bit soft, thin and oily. It has a strange texture that breaks into pieces that are more mushy than chewy. It is not as satisfying as the other "mock meat" products I've tried,  (2 examples are listed below). I suggest finding a way to taste one piece of this before committing to buy an entire case.<br /><br />For comparison, I would recommend "Stonewall's Jerquee" (soy, vegetarian, available on Amazon). Stonewalls has a better, chewer,"meatier" texture, soft enough to bite into, but drier and firm enough to chew for a short while. It comes in 7 flavors, none of which were unpleasant, like this Primal Strips flavor.<br /><br />Another tasty soy/meatless similar product is "Manna Soy Gourmet Meatless" (4 flavors, on Amazon). This comes in big, 4 pound, bags and 4 flavors. It starts out softer than jerky, but can be microwaved into dryer, chewy strips that are very satisfying. Very versatile for vegetarian/vegan diets and a good value for price.

review/text: Clean, fresh tasting olive oils.  Picual has a little kick to it which the 6 year old connoisseur in my house particularly enjoyed (for info she also is partial to only 2 year old Parmigiano Reggiano).  I personally like the single origin of the olives and the pure taste; it is also a bonus knowing that Chile is one of the least polluted places on earth. Great for gifts or a healthy splurge for your own kitchen.  Fast delivery & worth every penny.

review/text: I am a recent Keurig convert, and LOVE IT! But I have struggled slightly with the weaker coffees of K-Cups. I like my coffee with a pretty strong flavor.<br /><br />But today I am sitting here with my first cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold and can say, it is stronger than most but also feels rich in flavor, instead of bitter. It's very good!<br /><br />As far as shipping it arrived right on schedule, although the 50 K-Cups come loose in a large unlabeled  box, which was... odd. I just did a quick count to make sure they were all there and in good shape, which they were, and I just restocked a smaller K-Cup box in my cupboard. No big deal to me.<br /><br />While gambling with your $30 to pick a good coffee, I bet you'll win with this one.

review/text: EBEB is my favorite k-cup coffee flavor.  It has great flavor and is my preference for a bold coffee taste without being bitter.<br /><br />...but...<br /><br />I've had a lot of problems with the actual EBEB k-cup.  There is some manufacturing defect with these particular ones.  About every 3rd k-cup something gets clogged somewhere and it overpressures the cup resulting in coffee & grounds spilling out of the top of the cup holder on the machine.  I've purchased several different boxes of EBEB from different stores (including Amazon) and have had trouble with all of them.<br /><br />I've run hundreds of other styles of k-cup through our machine with no problems - this only happens with the EBEB.<br /><br />I called Keurig to tell them about it and while they were nice and sent me a free box of another type of coffee, they didn't seem to interested in understanding that there is some manufacturing defect in this coffee flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line is that I'm very sad - I won't buy EBEB anymore because of this continuing problem with the manufacturing.

review/text: Excellent coffee flavor - robust without being bitter.  I'd give this a five star rating were it not for the amount of grounds and sludge that are produced.  Don't drink the last quarter of your cup!

The pack of 50 come in a cardboard box. I like the 24 box package since they fit in my lazy Susan cabinet turn-around and take them out and feed the stainless K Cup holder on the counter. I think its more habit then anything else. As for the coffee.... try it!

review/summary: Messy cups
review/text: The flavor of the Big Easy Bold is good. But, about every third cup overflows out the top of the cup making a huge mess. It's as if the hole on the bottom gets plugged and the remaining coffee has nowhere to go but out the top...and all over the place. If this happened two or three times I'd give it four stars.

review/summary: Funky packs, mediocre taste
review/text: First- taste:  Bold-ish. I didn't get that full body taste that I expect from a bold brew. Bold does not equal strong. I will say say that it is very dark if that is what you are after. Starbucks 'Espresso Roast' is a better example of a good, smooth, bold brew.<br /><br />Second- the packs:  I don't know if I got a bad lot of packs but I end up with sludge in my cup about half of the time. I've shaken the packs, closed the top in slow motion, pushed the packs manually onto the bottom needle and all the other things you may have heard to fix pack problems. This particular box does not show the top of the pack to be 'proofed out' with nitrogen.  I've used about 12 of a 50 pack box. I've had to clean my machine twice.<br /><br />Planning to complain and return for a different product.

review/summary: AMZN CS RATES 5 STARS/Emerils not bad either.
review/text: I just received a box of 50 of the Deidrich french Roast. Upon opening the box I saw coffee grinds meaning some kcups broke open.<br /><br />I made a quick call to amzn. Not so upset at losing a few kcups...stuff happens. More upset at the time it would require to wipe the grinds off of each kcup and then find and throw away the damaged ones.<br /><br />AMZN very promptly gave me a full refund and since it was a 'Grocery Item', they said to keep it or throw it away, but they couldnt take it back.<br /><br />Obviously I took the time to clean everything and kept the undamaged kcups.<br /><br />I recently tried EMERILS BIG EASY BOLD and like it very much. Tried around 8 cups to ensure the last was as good as the first.<br /><br />I wont put it at the top of my 'favorite kcups' list, but will say it was very tasty and worth ordering.<br /><br />Nice 'Parisian' taste. Decent kick.<br /><br />4 star coffee + 5 star AMZN CS = BUY IT. You and your guests should like it and AMZN CS ensures if there is an issue, they will make it right.

I realize this is a 'bold' cup of coffee, but I wanted to share some of the remarks from my co-workers after/while drinking this coffee:<br /><br />"ugh. I feel like I am drinking pure gasoline"<br />"eww. this coffee tastes like death"<br />"big, easy, kill me."<br />"The only thing worse than this coffee, is no coffee"<br />"heyyyy, when is the next coffee order?..."<br /><br />Hope this helps any future coffee-ordering employees.

review/summary: Good coffee, weird packaging
review/text: Coffee is delicious but the k-cups come loose in the box (i.e. no packaging except for the box you see).  After shipment, the k-cups are all jumbled and thrown about in the box.  We previously got them in 2 25-packs that were easy to open and keep on the counter.  The first time we got this with the new packaging, I had to stop to count if there were really 50 there (seriously, does someone sit and count them as they go in?).  If you have a carousel or old packaging, it won't be an issue.  You will need some way to store them.

review/summary: How Could You Be So Bold
review/text: After FINALLY purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">the best coffee maker</a> I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a "to each his or her own" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the "Midnight Magic" brand; I've tried the "Jet Fuel" brand; I've tried the "Donut Shop" brand; I've tried all of the "Extra Bolds"; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!

review/summary: This one's good--Emeril's Big Easy Bold
review/text: I ran across this coffee when looking for a dark and 'bold' coffee.  I've always called that "a good strong cup of coffee".<br />This coffee meets my criteria for that.  It is not bitter and doesn't leave a bad coffee taste in your mouth.<br /><br />I'm a tightwad so the $.55/Kcup appealed to me also.  Sometimes I add a teaspoon of my favorite instant and rotate the Kcup 180 deg. and run it through again.  This gives me a second good cup of coffee at reduced prices.:)<br /><br />I will buy more of the Big Easy Bold.

review/summary: Very tasty blend - not a flavored coffee (yay!)
review/text: We got some of these in a sampler pack and really enjoyed them.  These are not the "extra bold" that have the 25% more grounds so you can make the larger (11 oz) cup, but it holds up nicely on the 9oz setting on my brewer.  Body is deep, good aroma with some bitterness that you would expect from a French Roast blend.  The Keurig review mentions that it uses a minimum of 50% rainforest alliance beans.<br /><br />This is not a flavored coffee, just a nice blend, so don't expect chicory coffee :-)  Now that Amazon sells them, we will put this into our rotation.

review/summary: Defective K-cups!  Great Coffee, but only 1 in 3 K-cups not defective
review/text: This product that comes in the Amazon packaging is defective. It appears in an attempt to save cost, too little foil material is used to seal the top of the K-cup.  As a result, when the K-cup is punctured by the Keurig coffee maker, the foil lid separates from the side of the k-cup, resulting in an explosion of coffee grounds in the coffee maker.  Only 1 of 3 k-cups did not do this.  It is specifically this brand/packaging, since I was making other varieties of k-cup coffee in the same coffee maker in the same time and none of those broke the seal and left grounds all in the coffee maker.<br />Looking at the seal on this product, compared to other K-cups varieties, this seal is MUCH tighter, and since there is a larger amount of coffee grounds in this k-cup, there's a lot more to make a mess!<br />Loved the taste of the coffee, but can't waste so much time cleaning up the coffee pot!  Don't buy in the Amazon hassle-free packaging, you'll be sorry!

review/summary: The best K-Cup, OBJECTIVELY
review/text: Look, I'm aware that every K-cup variety has a review saying "This is the best K-cup." But I know what I'm talking about, okay? We all know the kind of people whose favorite flavor is Caramel Vanilla Creme, or heaven forbid, "Cappuccino". I'm not talking to them. I don't use cutesy cliches like "cuppa joe" or "packs a punch". This is also not one of those stupid reviews that claims "This is the best cup of coffee I EVER DRANK", because we know K-Cups cannot really compete with fresh-roasted beans. But if you drink K-Cups and you have some discriminating taste in coffee, get this one. Emeril's bold is nice and bold, dark but not too dark, the flavor has some dimension besides "burnt"...trust me.<br /><br />P.S. If you did happen to brew any of those flavored kinds in your machine, because it's a shared machine or your mom got you a variety pack or something, brew a cup of water through first. Then look at all the stuff floating in it, and consider yourself educated.

review/text: I liked the coffee, it was bold but not bitter. I can't recommend though, due to at least 6 k-cups "blowing up" in my Keurig.<br /><br />The whole point of the Keurig is that it's quick, easy, and you get a decent cup of coffee out of it. When you're running late in the morning, and the seal around the K-Cup breaks and coffee / grounds go all over and you've got to clean it up, it's no longer a convenience and is a huge of a hassle.<br /><br />I'm sticking with the Tully's, I've gone through 4 boxes (200 pcs) so far and not a single "blow up".

review/text: I ordered these last month. Of the first six I've tried, five have blown open and spewed coffee grounds all over our machine (as well as in the cup). I'm getting rather tired of cleaning the Keurig. Normally, I buy our K-cups at local department store but buying in bulk here at Amazon was less expensive. Amazon has graciously replaced the first lot and I was told if this second lot has the same problems, to call them back and they will need to look at pulling the lot. After looking back at the reviews for this product, I think that would be a wise move considering many of us are having the same problem. Thankfully, Amazon's customer service is 5-star so I haven't lost my money.

review/summary: Used to be the best - NOT ANY MORE
review/text: Big Easy used to be one of the best bold blends out there.  NOT ANY MORE. The box of 50 I received about a week ago is one of the most disgusting blends I have ever tasted. Very BITTER, no distinguishable aroma, no flavor complexity, nothing going for it. If I was Emeril I would not want my name associated with it anymore. Maybe this will get straightened out, but while they are playing with the coffee chemistry set this blend is best avoided.
