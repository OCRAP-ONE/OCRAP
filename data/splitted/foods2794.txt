review/summary: IT's Not Chai
review/text: I purchased this product without reading the reviews beforehand.  However, had I read the reviews I might have been clued in that this product is not what the name claims!  It claims to be Chai Green Tea, but the pictures on the side of the box show that it is in fact 3 different types of teas (i.e.Grey,orange,etc.), not the one actual flavor of 'chai' tea like I had wanted.<br /><br />I bought this product as a holiday gift and if I had the option to send it back I would as I made this discovery while opening the shipment box. I would gladly send it back shrink-wrap intact and all for something else.<br /><br />IMO, 'chai tea' is a specific flavor produced from a blend of spices and based on that I was looking for the 'chai' in this product but didn't find it.<br /><br />I have nothing to add about the actual taste or quality since it is a gift for someone else, but I just thought I would put it out there in case someone else reads this first before buying.

review/summary: Bigelow Chai Green Tea
review/text: What I was expecting was a chai tea similar to one I find in popular coffee houses: a spiced tea infused with cream and sugar. This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Timothy's, Celestial, and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test. The K-cup chais are simply not the same as the coffee house chais. To approximate the coffee house chai you'll need to add your own cream/milk and sugar/honey and give it a little shake.

review/text: My dog seems to be thriving on the Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food. He previously had a medical problem that requried that I cook and defat all of his food. Of course he loved his special diet but I found it tiresome to cook every day after he recovered. I was able to wean him onto the Blue Buffalo with no problem. I love having the food delivered right to our door since both my husband and I are senior citizens and lugging bags of food from a store ia a hassle. So I guess this review is also a rave for Amazon Prime.

review/summary: HUGE LIFESAVER TO HV SHIPPED, HUGE FAN OF BBUFFALO
review/text: I have been purchasing BLUE BUFFALO dry dog food and treats as needed, for my dogs for quite awhile now.  Where my brother will purchase super expensive brands, and my father will purchase the cheapest brand.... I instead, being somewhat of a health nut and also wanting my pets to enjoy a healthy diet spent hours one day at Petsmart, reading the back of all the bags of dog food wanting to find something natural, healthy, without any chemicals, and to contain some glucosamine (which I also give her in tablet form daily ) and that they like and will eat!  After having spent hours reading all the labels of all different brands, found BLUE BUFFALO to be superior to the rest of their brands.<br />  Knowing that you should not switch dog food for they may get sick, or to do in a transition of time, I must admit while I do stay true to the BLUE BUFFFALO brand, I do go back and forth with the flavors to keep it interesting for the dogs.  I have to stick with non chicken flavors, so my dogs do love the salmon, duck, whitefish, and both longevity ones, in which case I am not sticking to longevity considering I was told by the vet to keep her calorie intake down now that she is 13, so I feel that is fair.  Only issue, is the Longevity for Mature Dogs is 58 online plus shipping, where its generally less at petsmart.  So I am back to going to the store and picking up dog food,  but I will miss those days of finding out to my surprise that it was either the same cost or less to buy online and IT SHIPS TO YOUR HOUSE!!!!! INSTEAD OF GOING TO A STORE, PARKING, RUNNING IN TO PICK UP A 24LB OR PLUS BAG OF FOOD, HAULING IT OUT TO THE CAR, AND THEN INTO YOUR HOUSE------- IMAGINE MY EXCITEMENT TO LEARN I COULD HAVE IT SHIPPED TO MY HOUSE FOR LESS MONEY!!!!!  So if you buy any other flavor of this food, I definetly advise you to just order it and have it shipped... ITS EASY AND EFFICIENT AND BRILLIANT!!!

review/summary: Dark Pieces Gotta Go?
review/text: I have a Queensland Heeler named Bisket, about 3 years old and switched over to Blue Buffalo (Adult) about a year ago from a decent pet food found in the store and petco. Bisket really likes Blue but does not like the dark pieces in it. She'll eat the first few bits (all) then starts to pick those chunks out. I have tried two different types of Blue and she does the same thing to both types. Also, I found her breath turned fishy or at the least, Foul from eating Blue Buffalo. Her scat is firm and she loves the food with the excieption of the vita chunks (dark chunks) so am I getting the full benefit of Bule? Is the price still worth paying for if she's not getting the full benefit of the food? Humm? I guess only her hair dresser knows for sure, lol<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YUGAG">Blue Buffalo Adult Dog Dry Food, Chicken and Rice Recipe, 15-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: Healthy and delicious
review/text: As someone who has cooked for her dogs for 4 yrs now, I was not too happy to switch back to dry dog food when meat prices soared. I had previously given one of my dogs Blue Buffalo so I knew it was a good quality food. Most of the time, my dogs are eating Blue Buffalo dry dog food and always gobble it up. Since I'm comparing to the home cooked meals I make, I find the dogs drink a lot more water and have more stools which isn't fun for clean up. Otherwise, the dogs are maintaining a good weight and their coats look healthy with a supplement of Salmon oil each day. Overall, I'm satisfied with this product.

review/summary: Lab Loves It!!
review/text: As my Lab has now reached what is considered to be the adult senior age, I wanted to find a new healthier dry kibble commensurate with his age.  The new kibble had to be one that wouldn't add excess weight due to a bit of slowing down in his activity i.e., he now becomes tired after a three mile walk instead of a heretofore 4-5 mile jaunt, he's not quite so ball-chasing crazy as before and his swims in the pool are not quite as often.  He also seems more prone to the seasonal allergies such as mountain cedar that also gives his human companion fits.  For his allergies I do have a vet prescribed shampoo that significantly reduces the middle of the night floor thumping waking up human companion from a deep sleep scratching times!  Plus he gets an allergy injection when the allergy gets really bad.<br /><br />I first tried a small bag of this kibble mixing it in at the vet reccommended ratio, e.g., 3 parts of the dry kibble I had been using to 1 part Blue Buffalo (hereafter referred to as BB) in order to properly aquaint his digestive system to the new kibble.  I noticed right away that he seemed to like the BB add in.  As the ratio changed, I noticed he was really tail wagging while munching.  As the ratio progressed to the now 3 parts BB to 1 part other kibble ratio, I noticed he tended to nose around the other kibble seemingly preferring the BB. I've also noticed his (winter) coat has a bit more shine to it, pet dander is less noticible, the above middle of the night scratching has become even less frequent and he has dropped a few pounds as well. Next week begins 100% BB and it appears my boy will be perfectly happy with only the BB kibble in his bowl.<br /><br />I have also switched to a number of other BB products including their chew bones and some dry treats. My Lab loves them all and seems to look forward to treat time even more (if that's possible).<br /><br />Unless something drastic happens to change my mind, I will be sticking to this BB dry kibble product notwithstanding it tends to be a bit pricey.  The ingredients appear to be some of the healthiest available in pet food and treats, there doesn't appear to be any animal by-product fillers or unhealthy for pets grains, it hasn't caused any weight gain and doesn't seem to further irritate his allergies.  Yes, according to the Vet, the type and kind of food/treats you feed your pet can both cause or irritate (existing) allergies.  I took my Lab to raise and love and wouldn't think of giving him food or treats that contain ingredients that are unhealthy or even harmful to his health.  Plus, BB products are made right here in the U.S.A.<br /><br />I will NEVER EVER buy any pet food product that is made in CHINA!  Pet owners, PLEASE, read the label before you buy your pet foods and treats.  If it indicates it is made in China, PLEASE don't buy it.  It is a well known, documented and published fact that thousands of pets have already been sickened or died from eating pet food/treat products made in China where everything from cheap fillers such as melamine powder (the same ingredient they make melamine dinnerware from!) to diseased, rotting meat flesh, dead animals still in plastic bags are all tossed into the mix.  There is little to no quality control in China.  The goal is to make cheap, ship it off to the U.S. where it is sold by distributors for a high price and profit.  Given the thousands of both human and pet consumable food products that hit U.S. shores on a daily basis, the FDA, with their ever shrinking inspector cadre thanks to Washington's budget cuts, can do only so much to catch tainted human and/or pet food products once they reach the U.S.<br /><br />Shame on all the U.S. companies who buy China made pet food products for distribution in the U.S. in the first place and then hype them up to pet owners via cutesy advertising all the while being careful to not disclose the fact in said advertising that the product was made in China. If that fact was made known up front, given historical data on China made pet food products, doubt sales would be very good.  It is overtly obvious the only concern of the distributors is to make a fast greedy buck; never mind the fact that feeding these China made products can result in serious illness to or even the death of a pet.<br /><br />In the event any negative changes occur as a result of long term feeding of this dry kibble brand, I will immediately update this review.

review/summary: Great cat food.  It's a keeper!
review/text: All 3 of my cats love this food.  They were previously on Wellness Turkey and when the cans were recalled I tried this on the suggestion of a family friend since their one cat has the same crystal issues our oldest does.  He eats his prescription dry in the morning and this at night.  Normally he's content to let the other two cats get to their food first and hold back with patience for his own, but with this it is the first time I have seen him muscle away the other two cats to eat.  I'll be sticking with this and the turkey flavor.<br /><br />Also there is no fish in this or the turkey flavor wet or dry foods which is excellent!  My cats don't tend to enjoy food that has fish in it and this is one of the few foods I can find that is both good for them and has no fish.  One of them does not like the peas in the food, he will eat around them, but one of the others eats them when he's done.  So if your cat hates bits of veggies they may not really enjoy it as much.<br /><br />Oh and one more point, it doesn't have that funky wet food smell a lot of other foods (even good ones) have.  I really can't smell it once I stand up after putting it in the bowl.

review/summary: Excellent choice for my finicky feline!
review/text: Since my elderly cat has started eating a wet food diet, she's become extremely finicky. She used to eat anything I'd put in front of her, until about a year ago when she decided nothing was good enough.  I'd been through every brand in the store...she doesn't like fish, plain chicken or lamb so my choices were limited.  When I found this, I gave it a try since she primarily likes beef. The ingredients were excellent and I read great reviews from Vets about it online.  She has been scarfing this food down from day 1 and still loves it. There are peas and carrots in it and the  consistency of it is very mushy. She likes it that way, so she doesn't have to chew much. I also noticed it doesn't dry out if there's any left in her bowl for several hours, like other brands have.  I definitely plan to continue giving this to her. I've been ordering on Amazon since it's been difficult to find it in my local pet stores lately.

review/summary: Cats are obligate carnivores
review/text: Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal. Cats have hard time digesting plant matter. This is closer to dog food than cat food since dog's physiology will allow digestion of many plant based food itms. My cats ate about half of the yellow goo around the peas and carrots. If you want a true holistic approach for cats, veggies gotta go.

review/text: After my cat was diagnosed with renal failure, he refused to eat any of the canned versions of his vet prescribed food for kidney disease although he would eat Hill's Science Diet k/d dry food, but he was vomiting it up regularily. Since his diet requires low protein after searching online I finally found Spot's Stew. My cat really likes it and readily eats the chicken, turkey and salmon varieties. Granted sometimes he eats around the carrots, peas and green beans, but he does eat them. I really like that Spot's Stew is an all natural cat food with no by-products or fillers, and especially that it is an alternative for my cat that he really enjoys.

review/summary: Dog Food Masquerading as Cat Food
review/text: My cat loved the dry version of spot's stew.  When she was sick with a UTI, I purchased this in hopes of adding some additional fluid to her diet.  When I dumped it in her bowel, she looked up at me as if I were mad, and I couldn't blame her.  It is literally "stew," with whole chunks of peas, carrots, etc. in it.  Cats are carnivores.  I have owned several, and I have never seen one of them willingly eat a piece of fruit or vegetable, grain products excluded, that hadn't been completely ground up and disguised in something else.<br /><br />She took one sniff and walked away.  Of course, cats are unpredictable creatures and YMMV.  But there are loads of good quality pate-style wet foods and all-meat wet foods that most cats are more likely to prefer.

review/text: I purchased this for my 15 year old cat who has health issues. Unfortunately, this cat decided after about 2 cans that she was not going to eat any more health food. She didn't eat the first cans very well even though I tried giving it in the morning when she's the hungriest and she licked a couple times and then followed me around meowing for something else. I finally gave up and gave it to the other cats. Two of the seven other cats will eat it but they leave the peas and anything else that is not mashed. So as far as I'm concerned it is great food, but the cats weren't impressed.

Before deciding for or against this product, try just a couple of flavors from Petco or Petsmart first. My cat goes ga-ga for all of this product, including the vegetables. Every cat's different. I know this product is healthy from looking at the label. I used to buy Blue, but one of the top Blue ingredients is chicken meal, which, if you look that up on the internet, is chicken skin. Uggh! I wouldn't ever want my furry loved one to eat skin - that's like feeding a human infant McDonald's, no offense to McD's.

review/summary: Wow! Cat Food That Seems Yummy!
review/text: Wow! I have the pickiest cats in the whole universe.  The only wet food they eat is Spot's Stew Chicken.  I can get them to eat the Chicken/Beef flavor if I add some shaved Bonito but with three cats Slinky, Jester and Regal, only Slinky and Jester scarf the food down.  They will eat the chicken without the Bonito but Regal is another story.  She won't eat it at first but might come back later and eat some.  She will ONLY eat the Chicken and does not like Bonito so with her, it gets a little more tough.  However, this food is a wonderful consistency, smells good (to me the human) and I assume to the kitties as well because they LOVE this stuff.  For the vegetables, I don't know if cats really need them however, I mush them up with the meat and they don't notice.  If I miss mushing some, then yes they try to eat around the peas/carrots.  All I can say is thank goodness for this food.  I spent lots of money and time trying to find something they would like.  I also feed them a mix of Halo dry Sensitive Formula Turkey and Purina Dental Health.  In order to prevent urinary symptoms, I give my cats only fresh bottled water every day that I put in bowls all over the house.  With the good water, the good food and lots of petting, I have the happiest cats in Arizona!  Thank you Halo!!

review/summary: Chicken and Beef
review/text: I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe. Whenever I put it out at feeding time, there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot's Stew in them. With 5 kitty mouths to feed, the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot's Stew, so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied. Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting, those poor things that had to "settle" for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew. I have been so pleased with it, that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners.<br />But, at our house, WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines!

review/summary: Picky felines love this canned food
review/text: My two cats somehow never figured out how to use their teeth to bite into their food--given dry food, they'll just use their tongues to lick it up and swallow the kernels whole, with an occasional bite with the teeth to crunch on food that's already been delivered into their mouths.  For a while I despaired of getting them to eat wet food, as they would just sit there and lick up all the juices, without getting much of the meat.  Typical canned food is just packed too tight, and the texture is not amenable for breaking off little bits with just their tongues.  Finally, I tried out Spot's Stew, which solved the problem.  This food is much looser, I think due to the inclusion of peas and other veggies, and the meat part is just the right consistency where they can lick it up successfully.  At first the cats would eat around the veggies, but they now lick up every morsel, and even prefer the Spot's Stew over the Wellness pouches.  I also like that the food doesn't contain any fish, as one of my cats is allergic to something or other (his back legs are always itchy, and he'll pull out the hair), and the vet suggested it might be fish.  Anyways, thank goodness for Spot's Stew, otherwise my teeth-challenged cats would never have been able to enjoy wet food!

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: I wasn't sure what would come of my venture in buying this food for my 2 cats that can eat poultry after reading the mixed reviews, but thought it was worth a try.  I am so glad I did!  I was expecting a stew like another reviewer said, and I guess you could refer to it that way.  When I opened the first can that is what I was expecting to see, but instead it is a course pate with chunks of veges in it. Kind of like a toddler food.  Cats are tricky to please for sure, but mine loved everything about this food.  They not only ate the chunks of veges, but licked their bowls clean.  I love the fact that it was such a hit, and will continue to buy it for them.  I also love that is like something you would make for them at home, only with all the right vitamins and minerals added.  Very user friendly.  My 3rd cat cannot eat poultry, so until Halo makes one without chicken in it, she will be fine with her Nature's variety instinct rabbit and Tiki foods.<br />UPDATE - 11-16-2011  My cat has been eating this now for a little while and she always seems hungry when she gets this!  I don't think I will be buying more for her.  I do think it is a good food and probably perfect for cats that need the lower protein, but mine need less moisture in the food and more meat.  I always add about a tablespoon of water on their canned food anyway.  Cost wise, this is about the same as Natures Variety, Natures Logic and even Addiction which are wonderful foods.  I like it better when I add the moisture and am paying for meat in their food.

review/text: I used to buy this at Whole Foods, which seems to have discontinued it.  Glad to find it at Amazon!<br /><br />This is one of the few foods all 3 cats will eat.  And none seem to pick out the veggies!  The soft texture, and good nutrition, is excellent for (1) the elderly cat (2) the cat who's sick and (3) the cat who will literally eat anything, but you'd prefer he eat something healthy!<br /><br />This is "human quality" cat food, meaning the ingredients are pure enough for a human to eat, and it smells a little like chicken pot pie filling!

review/text: I have a kitten that just LOVES this stuff. The breeder I got him from didn't give me any of his old food, and I had heard that switching food quickly causes stomach upset... but I read about Spot's Stew being great for problem tummies and it's true! My kitten has never had any problems on this food since we brought him home. Also, from the human perspective, this stuff smells like chicken/turkey/fish and not like dog vomit, like certain brands of cat food. Big plus for me.

review/text: The texture of this food is like cooled pea soup.  It's not as stiff as some of the pate style foods and my cat likes it.  All but the veggies that is.  So she leaves not only the veggies, and there are a lot of them, but also a good bit of the chicken surrounding each veggy.  This makes for more waste than I am willing to tolerate so I won't be buying any more Spot's Stew.

review/summary: So disappointed that this didn't work for my kitties
review/text: The first time I served this they both chowed down on it...except for the veges as everyone seems to complain about...but then a little while later they both came back and finished up the veges too!  So I thought this was the greatest thing...but the next time I fed them the one cat decided the novelty had worn off and wanted nothing to do with it.  The other one though continued to chow down, and again left the veges, but came back later and ate most of them.  The next serving -what do you know -neither of them wanted it anymore.  I don't get it -I've never had cats like something so much one day and the next day be turned off from it.  I'm very disappointed, I wanted them to like it, knowing how good it is for them.

review/text: My cats love this brand of food, especially the salmon and turkey flavors. However, they leave the peas and carrots behind. Which makes me feel like I'm not getting my money's worth! However, I've started squishing the carrots into the food, and they seem to be leaving less in their bowls. After trying many brands of canned foods, this is one of the few that they eagerly eat, and it doesn't smell as bad as some.

review/summary: Excellent supplement to canine raw food diet
review/text: I buy and re-buy this item.  I find it always consistent in its quality and blending.  It's grain-free, which I feel is important, and I use it to supplement the raw food diet I feed my dog. As the first step in my process to feed my dog, I put about 1 Tablespoon in a small dish, heat filtered water in a tea kettle, and with the water warm but not hot, pour about 1 Tablespoon of water onto the veggies.  I let the mixture sit and rehydrate while I gather the other items I put into my dog's food bowl, especially his previously frozen and subsequently thawed raw meat or fish for that meal. The last thing I do is combine the veggies, simply stirring them in. I read a review somewhere else that someone's dog got gas from eating the veggies.  My dog didn't but I think that's because I routinely give my dogs digestive enzymes and probiotics.  I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />The only thing I would have wanted to know before buying the product the first time is that it comes with an EXCELLENT feeding guide. All good.

review/summary: Great cat food.  It's a keeper!
review/text: All 3 of my cats love this food.  They were previously on Wellness Turkey and when the cans were recalled I tried this on the suggestion of a family friend since their one cat has the same crystal issues our oldest does.  He eats his prescription dry in the morning and this at night.  Normally he's content to let the other two cats get to their food first and hold back with patience for his own, but with this it is the first time I have seen him muscle away the other two cats to eat.  I'll be sticking with this and the turkey flavor.<br /><br />Also there is no fish in this or the turkey flavor wet or dry foods which is excellent!  My cats don't tend to enjoy food that has fish in it and this is one of the few foods I can find that is both good for them and has no fish.  One of them does not like the peas in the food, he will eat around them, but one of the others eats them when he's done.  So if your cat hates bits of veggies they may not really enjoy it as much.<br /><br />Oh and one more point, it doesn't have that funky wet food smell a lot of other foods (even good ones) have.  I really can't smell it once I stand up after putting it in the bowl.

review/summary: Excellent choice for my finicky feline!
review/text: Since my elderly cat has started eating a wet food diet, she's become extremely finicky. She used to eat anything I'd put in front of her, until about a year ago when she decided nothing was good enough.  I'd been through every brand in the store...she doesn't like fish, plain chicken or lamb so my choices were limited.  When I found this, I gave it a try since she primarily likes beef. The ingredients were excellent and I read great reviews from Vets about it online.  She has been scarfing this food down from day 1 and still loves it. There are peas and carrots in it and the  consistency of it is very mushy. She likes it that way, so she doesn't have to chew much. I also noticed it doesn't dry out if there's any left in her bowl for several hours, like other brands have.  I definitely plan to continue giving this to her. I've been ordering on Amazon since it's been difficult to find it in my local pet stores lately.

review/summary: Cats are obligate carnivores
review/text: Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal. Cats have hard time digesting plant matter. This is closer to dog food than cat food since dog's physiology will allow digestion of many plant based food itms. My cats ate about half of the yellow goo around the peas and carrots. If you want a true holistic approach for cats, veggies gotta go.

Since his diet requires low protein after searching online I finally found Spot's Stew. My cat really likes it and readily eats the chicken, turkey and salmon varieties. Granted sometimes he eats around the carrots, peas and green beans, but he does eat them. I really like that Spot's Stew is an all natural cat food with no by-products or fillers, and especially that it is an alternative for my cat that he really enjoys.

review/text: My cat loved the dry version of spot's stew.  When she was sick with a UTI, I purchased this in hopes of adding some additional fluid to her diet.  When I dumped it in her bowel, she looked up at me as if I were mad, and I couldn't blame her.  It is literally "stew," with whole chunks of peas, carrots, etc. in it.  Cats are carnivores.  I have owned several, and I have never seen one of them willingly eat a piece of fruit or vegetable, grain products excluded, that hadn't been completely ground up and disguised in something else.<br /><br />She took one sniff and walked away.  Of course, cats are unpredictable creatures and YMMV.  But there are loads of good quality pate-style wet foods and all-meat wet foods that most cats are more likely to prefer.

review/text: I purchased this for my 15 year old cat who has health issues. Unfortunately, this cat decided after about 2 cans that she was not going to eat any more health food. She didn't eat the first cans very well even though I tried giving it in the morning when she's the hungriest and she licked a couple times and then followed me around meowing for something else. I finally gave up and gave it to the other cats. Two of the seven other cats will eat it but they leave the peas and anything else that is not mashed. So as far as I'm concerned it is great food, but the cats weren't impressed.

I know this product is healthy from looking at the label. I used to buy Blue, but one of the top Blue ingredients is chicken meal, which, if you look that up on the internet, is chicken skin. Uggh!

review/summary: Wow! Cat Food That Seems Yummy!
review/text: Wow! I have the pickiest cats in the whole universe.  The only wet food they eat is Spot's Stew Chicken.  I can get them to eat the Chicken/Beef flavor if I add some shaved Bonito but with three cats Slinky, Jester and Regal, only Slinky and Jester scarf the food down.  They will eat the chicken without the Bonito but Regal is another story.  She won't eat it at first but might come back later and eat some.  She will ONLY eat the Chicken and does not like Bonito so with her, it gets a little more tough.  However, this food is a wonderful consistency, smells good (to me the human) and I assume to the kitties as well because they LOVE this stuff.  For the vegetables, I don't know if cats really need them however, I mush them up with the meat and they don't notice.  If I miss mushing some, then yes they try to eat around the peas/carrots.  All I can say is thank goodness for this food.  I spent lots of money and time trying to find something they would like.  I also feed them a mix of Halo dry Sensitive Formula Turkey and Purina Dental Health.  In order to prevent urinary symptoms, I give my cats only fresh bottled water every day that I put in bowls all over the house.  With the good water, the good food and lots of petting, I have the happiest cats in Arizona!  Thank you Halo!!

review/summary: Chicken and Beef
review/text: I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe. Whenever I put it out at feeding time, there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot's Stew in them. With 5 kitty mouths to feed, the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot's Stew, so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied. Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting, those poor things that had to "settle" for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew. I have been so pleased with it, that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners.<br />But, at our house, WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines!

review/summary: Picky felines love this canned food
review/text: My two cats somehow never figured out how to use their teeth to bite into their food--given dry food, they'll just use their tongues to lick it up and swallow the kernels whole, with an occasional bite with the teeth to crunch on food that's already been delivered into their mouths.  For a while I despaired of getting them to eat wet food, as they would just sit there and lick up all the juices, without getting much of the meat.  Typical canned food is just packed too tight, and the texture is not amenable for breaking off little bits with just their tongues.  Finally, I tried out Spot's Stew, which solved the problem.  This food is much looser, I think due to the inclusion of peas and other veggies, and the meat part is just the right consistency where they can lick it up successfully.  At first the cats would eat around the veggies, but they now lick up every morsel, and even prefer the Spot's Stew over the Wellness pouches.  I also like that the food doesn't contain any fish, as one of my cats is allergic to something or other (his back legs are always itchy, and he'll pull out the hair), and the vet suggested it might be fish.  Anyways, thank goodness for Spot's Stew, otherwise my teeth-challenged cats would never have been able to enjoy wet food!

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: I wasn't sure what would come of my venture in buying this food for my 2 cats that can eat poultry after reading the mixed reviews, but thought it was worth a try.  I am so glad I did!  I was expecting a stew like another reviewer said, and I guess you could refer to it that way.  When I opened the first can that is what I was expecting to see, but instead it is a course pate with chunks of veges in it. Kind of like a toddler food.  Cats are tricky to please for sure, but mine loved everything about this food.  They not only ate the chunks of veges, but licked their bowls clean.  I love the fact that it was such a hit, and will continue to buy it for them.  I also love that is like something you would make for them at home, only with all the right vitamins and minerals added.  Very user friendly.  My 3rd cat cannot eat poultry, so until Halo makes one without chicken in it, she will be fine with her Nature's variety instinct rabbit and Tiki foods.<br />UPDATE - 11-16-2011  My cat has been eating this now for a little while and she always seems hungry when she gets this!  I don't think I will be buying more for her.  I do think it is a good food and probably perfect for cats that need the lower protein, but mine need less moisture in the food and more meat.  I always add about a tablespoon of water on their canned food anyway.  Cost wise, this is about the same as Natures Variety, Natures Logic and even Addiction which are wonderful foods.  I like it better when I add the moisture and am paying for meat in their food.

review/text: I used to buy this at Whole Foods, which seems to have discontinued it.  Glad to find it at Amazon!<br /><br />This is one of the few foods all 3 cats will eat.  And none seem to pick out the veggies!  The soft texture, and good nutrition, is excellent for (1) the elderly cat (2) the cat who's sick and (3) the cat who will literally eat anything, but you'd prefer he eat something healthy!<br /><br />This is "human quality" cat food, meaning the ingredients are pure enough for a human to eat, and it smells a little like chicken pot pie filling!

review/text: I have a kitten that just LOVES this stuff. The breeder I got him from didn't give me any of his old food, and I had heard that switching food quickly causes stomach upset... but I read about Spot's Stew being great for problem tummies and it's true! My kitten has never had any problems on this food since we brought him home. Also, from the human perspective, this stuff smells like chicken/turkey/fish and not like dog vomit, like certain brands of cat food. Big plus for me.

review/text: The texture of this food is like cooled pea soup.  It's not as stiff as some of the pate style foods and my cat likes it.  All but the veggies that is.  So she leaves not only the veggies, and there are a lot of them, but also a good bit of the chicken surrounding each veggy.  This makes for more waste than I am willing to tolerate so I won't be buying any more Spot's Stew.

review/summary: So disappointed that this didn't work for my kitties
review/text: The first time I served this they both chowed down on it...except for the veges as everyone seems to complain about...but then a little while later they both came back and finished up the veges too!  So I thought this was the greatest thing...but the next time I fed them the one cat decided the novelty had worn off and wanted nothing to do with it.  The other one though continued to chow down, and again left the veges, but came back later and ate most of them.  The next serving -what do you know -neither of them wanted it anymore.  I don't get it -I've never had cats like something so much one day and the next day be turned off from it.  I'm very disappointed, I wanted them to like it, knowing how good it is for them.

However, I've started squishing the carrots into the food, and they seem to be leaving less in their bowls. After trying many brands of canned foods, this is one of the few that they eagerly eat, and it doesn't smell as bad as some.

But badly dented cans may force me to look elsewhere for the product which my cat enjoys.

review/text: I do not have human children so I can only comment on how this works for my furry kids. I have a cat with severe pancreas/GI issues & he has steadily lost weight over the past 2 years.He cannot seem to absorb enough nutrients from his foods. He is on B-12 shots & prednisolone to help calm the inflammation & spure his appetite but sometimes the ONLY thing he will eat is this chicken baby food. He has also eaten the ham & turkey versions of this brand but lately...........just the chicken. He's fussy & has always been a "drama queen" & he also has allergies in the Autumn that affect his willingness to eat (if a cat can't smell the food a cat won;t eat the food) so getting anything into him is helpful & the baby food is good for both nutrition & for hydration.My husband & I will do most anything to keep him happy & enjoying his quality of life for as long as possible & this baby food helps us do that for him. Our other 3 cats also enjoy this as a sometimes treat so it works well for our family.

This is a little loose off the shelf, but after refrigeration it is perfect to wrap around a pill and feed him off a spoon.

I have also tried other varieties that are very soupy and are to messy for babies or pets.

review/text: My baby is ready for some new foods in her diet so I decided to give Gerber 2nd Foods a try. Gerber 2nds is vastly different from the other brands of 2nd baby foods that we have tried. The other brands seem to be similar in consistency. There is really no difference in the consistency of Gerber 1sts and 2nds. The difference is that 2nds includes turkey, chicken and beef and 1sts are all fruits and veggies. My baby did not find Gerber 2nds appetizing. The color and odor of the chicken is also nothing like actual chicken. I placed the lid back on the jar and refrigerated the jar since I was hoping to try it with her for another meal. The next day I got the Gerber 2nds jar from the fridge and reheated it. When it was reheated the food was so runny that she could have drunk it from a bottle. The consistency does not keep from one day to the next. If you're looking for a baby food with chicken, turkey, or beef then I would recommend that you try Beech Nut Stage 1. My baby loved the Beech Nut turkey, chicken, and beef. The only problem is that the major grocery stores in my area do not sell Beech Nut. Next trip that I make I plan to stock up on the Beech Nut!

So if your not buying from the person who is actually tending the bees and they state that they are not heating the honey to get it out of the comb but have a spinner then it is truly raw and not cut with corn syrup. If it's too good to be true then it probably is.

Of course, this can be true of any pet food, even the expensive kind, but when it's that cheap, I question it.<br /><br />My cat, however, loved the flavor of this food.  She devoured it in no time.  She only gets a small amount in the mornings as a treat, but she loves it.  This is NOT a food I'd want my cat to live on.<br /><br />The food is pate style, but has a more gelatinous consistency than other pate styles from brands like Hills' Science Diet or even Purina.  My cat doesn't mind this texture, but if you're using this type of food to mix medicine or supplements into, it's a bit more difficult.<br /><br />There isn't a ton of gravy with this variety, but enough that it is very moist.  After refrigerating it, it solidifies quite a bit, so I add a little warm water to it and mix.<br /><br />The packaging opens easily and cleanly, which is nice.  You cannot reseal the container if you don't use it all at once, but I guess you could kind of pinch the sides of the foil top over the sides of the plastic tub for a day or so.  I put the remaining food into a little glass jar and refrigerate that.  That way, the scent of the cat food doesn't permeate my fridge or my own food.<br /><br />Do I recommend this cat food?  Yes and no.  If you're on a tight budget, it's okay.  If you're like me and ran out of wet food, and didn't want to face the wrath of a cat not getting her morning treat, then it's also okay.  But you can certainly do better.

review/summary: Mastered it!
review/text: My cat enjoys feeding balls, and my dog loves his big Kong Wobbler so I decided to see if Nugget could manage this toy as a food dispenser. He is very interested in it and periodically bats at it to see if food will come out, but so far he hasn't mastered the necessary technique. We show him how it works by pulling on the attached attractant at the top to spill food out for him. That always gets his interest, but he just hasn't figured it out for himself yet. We haven't given up and are still hopeful that a light will suddenly come on. The concept is fine and the interest is there, but the motivation may not be high enough for a cat. I like the idea of my animals "working" for their dinner because it adds interest to their lives. It's what they are meant to do. We will keep trying with this toy and I'll update this review if we are successful. However, at least for my cat who is used to feeding toys and clicker training, this toy requires input from the human(s) in the family. That's not a bad thing. It's too easy to put the food in a bowl and walk away. Interaction is something we should encourage with our animals and the Kong Cat Wobbler requires that in our situation so far.<br /><br />(UPDATE) Nugget has mastered the Cat Wobbler at last and loves it! This took several months with us helping him spill food from it. At some point recently , he got the idea that food would come out if he just pushed it around enough. He uses the plume to pull it over. I love this toy for him because it is a real challenge. Nugget has cerebellar hypoplasia with moderate motor problems. He cannot jump or climb vertically, and he has an uneven gait. For him, any new skill or accomplishment builds confidence and makes him happy. I give him the Cat Wobbler with pellets (not filled because it would be too much food for him) several times a week when we go to bed. I hear him working with it throughout the night; he has emptied it by morning. It was worth the time showing him how to use it because it gives him something interesting to do for several hours at a time.

review/summary: My cat loves his wobbler!
review/text: We got one of these for our larger cat to put his dry food in, and he absolutely loves it. There was a bit of a learning curve, but once we knocked it over a few times, he figured it out. And I love that he gets exercise and a lot of entertainment out of it. He is very food motivated though; our smaller cat who doesn't like dry food as much never uses it. I'm taking off one star because we've had it since mid August, so about two months, and recently I noticed a large crack in the top plastic. We do use it a few times a day, everyday, but I would think a Kong product would be able to withstand constant use for longer than that. But I will definitely buy a new one if this one falls apart, I don't think my cat would forgive me if I didn't.

review/text: I opened it up, put the treats in. My cat came over and sniffed it, then never looked at it again. It seems like its good quality but the treats may be too difficult to get out, especially if you have a smaller cat that isn't as aggressive.

review/summary: Make sure your cat doesn't get bored quickly
review/text: I bought this for my mom's three cats... and only one of the three actually plays with it.  One cat looked at it, sniffed it, batted it once or twice and walked away.  The second time he "played" with it, he managed to get a piece of kibble out... and walked away.  He isn't one to walk away from food so that was interesting.<br /><br />Kitty #2 walks past it.<br /><br />Kitty #3 will actually play, get some food out, eat it.  Maybe bat it two or three more times then walk away.<br /><br />It seems to be constructed well, easy to put some kibble or other small bites in, and isn't obnoxious when the cat actually play with it. That's why it gets a decent rating.  I don't want to knock it because these cats have their preferences :)<br /><br />However, I would not purchase a toy like this again knowing how the cats reacted. My mom keeps it out, but it is definitely not their "go to" toy, even with their favorite treats inside.

review/summary: Cats are confused...
review/text: I'm not sure if my cats are just dumb, or....<br /><br />Anyway, they do like this toy when they actually realize there are treats in there.  They fall out pretty easily--but that's if you put some effort into knocking it over.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good idea for a cat toy, but would be better if the toy was a bit lighter in weight.

review/text: I am glad that the store put this in a large paper bag.  The cats do love playing with that!  They won't touch the toy.  They do want the treats inside but we have to keep kicking it over for them to get the treats out.  They are not interested in doing that themselves.

review/text: I have 4 cats; 1 being a Maine coon. They really didn't seem like they could smell the treats that were inside the toy. They didn't care to play with the thing. But they did manage to rip that black fuzzy tail on top right off the toy immediately.<br />I wrote to Kong to tell them of my experience & got no reply. Very expensive black fuzzy tail toy.

review/summary: Good toy but you have to do some trickery...
review/text: I have a pretty finicky cat so she was interested for about five seconds before she lost interest. It wasn't until she realized that treats come out of it, then she became interested in the toy.<br /><br />About the toy itself: it's sturdy and it doesn't break easy, despite all the movement I did with it, trying to get my cat to play with it. I do wish there were more than just that one hole, it would be a lot easier trying to get the cat to play with it to get the treats.

review/summary: Do not leave food bowl out and cat WILL use this
review/text: If the only food that your cat has access to is from this toy, he will learn to interact with it. Sure he might get a little frustrated or fussy in the first few days but the payoff is you will have a cat who:<br />1. Is mentally stimulated<br />2. Gets exercise<br />3. Has something else to think about other than waking you up in the middle of the night.

review/summary: My cats ignored it
review/text: I bought this for my cats who are 2 and 3 years old.  They no longer act like kittens.  I let them watch me put their food in it and sat there with them to show them how to get the food out.  Well I did this several times and my cats looked at me like I was crazy.  Maybe it's because my cats are spoiled but they kinda knew all they had to do was wait long enough and I would put food in their bowls.  They ignored this toy entirely.  It was if they said, "Work for our food? We don't think so!"!  So then I tried just using treats, but that still didn't work.  I eventually gave it to my friend who just got a kitten.  The kitten played with it for a while until it reached a certain age and then that was it.  I think this concept only works with dogs.

review/summary: Holistic Select Dog Food - EXCELLENT!
review/text: We switched to this dog food after our 12 yr old mixed breed dog started losing weight and developed severe dermatitis, itching, scratching and shedding! For 12 yrs, we had been giving her a name brand dry product we purchased at local pet stores.  She is a completely different dog these days!  She has gained back all her weight, is happy, and does not itch,scratch or shed.  I HIGHLY recommend this dog food!  It is made of natural, good ingredients.
