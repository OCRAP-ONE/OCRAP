review/text: I ordered these lobster tails recently, being a little leery that they weren't cold water lobster tails.  Anyway, I had nothing to worry about.  The lobster tails were tender and tasty, not chewy and bland as some I have ordered from other places in the past.<br /><br />As usual, Omaha's customer service and delivery were excellent as well.

review/text: Exactly what Thai Iced tea should be. I love how each tea bag is individually wrapped allowing me to take the tea anywhere for me to brew. Keep in mind, packaging can be misleading though showing the tea with milk. This tea doesn't have milk in it and you'll need to add it yourself. Aside from that, the product itself is excellent though.

review/summary: Convenient, but makes horrible coffee
review/text: I got this as a Christmas gift and was at first thrilled.  But after a month of use, I have to finally admit that it makes horrible coffee.<br /><br />For starters, I like good coffee (and I do NOT consider STARBUCKS in this category).  I buy Seattle's Best or Lion Coffee, use filtered water, and clean my coffeemaker thoroughly every use so it looks new.  I use 2+ scoops for 14 OZ and somehow it still tastes incredibly weak.  By contrast, I only use one scoop in a regular drip maker and not only does it taste robust, but I don't need to go through coffee twice as fast.<br /><br />Greatly disappointed.

review/summary: For CANNED organic pineapple, it is excellent & PBA-free can
review/text: Of course I prefer to get my foods either fresh or in glass jars.  But when neither of those are an option, then I resort to canned foods--IF THEY ARE PBA-free cans.<br /><br />For a canned food, I rate this 5 stars even though it's a canned product because:  (1) I only eat organic foods, and it is rare that anyone in the DC metro area sells ORGANIC fresh pineapple; (2) the Native Forest cans are now PBA-free [with the exception--according to the manufacturer--of a few veggie items that haven't yet been converted as of Spring 2012]; and (3) extensive online searching revealed that NO ONE sells organic pineapple in glass jars.  So if I want organic pineapple, I have no option but to buy it in cans.<br /><br />I've so far consumed about 15 cans of this pineapple.  In only 1 can so far did the pineapple have a slight "can taste" that one of the other reviewers referred to.  Yeah, I don't like that distinctive "can taste" either.  But except for that one can, the pineapple has tasted very good--and no unripe pieces or detritus, or pieces of pineapple core or outer skin.  So I'm pleased, and it satisfies my craving for pineapple when I can't get fresh organic.<br /><br />Dented cans: this has been a problem with 2 shipments over the past 6 months, because the manufacturer fails to put adequate cushioning inside the box to protect the cans.  So when the box gets tossed around during shipment, some of the cans can be dented.  When they arrive too dented to open or raise concerns about whether the seal might have been broken on the pull-off lid, I call Amazon customer service and request a refund or a replacement shipment.  Amazon has been great about either immediately issuing a refund for the damaged cans or immediately shipping out replacement cans that arrive within 2-3 days.

review/summary: Crisp, refreshing, light on flavor, but organic
review/text: We try to purchase organic options whenever possible.  We live in a remote area with extremely limited transportation and like to have a healthy supply of non-perishable foods available. Also, where we live, a pineapple is $10-13 (USD).  Thus, we supplement with canned, frozen, dried, freeze-dried etc.  So because of our circumstances and because of our desire to eat organic, I would buy this pineapple again even though I have had more flavorful brands.  The cans are sturdy and arrived without dents. They have pop-top lids, which is handy for traveling, lunches, etc.  I ate one can after having placed it in the refrigerator for several hours.  The juice was delicious.  The pineapple pieces were crisp and firm but light on flavor.  During a three-day work trip to a remote location, I ate from the can several times, and it was a nice supplement to my other foods.  This product does not compare to a grocery store pineapple.  It certainly does not compare to a Hawaiian pineapple, but as a substitute to more dried fruit, it was a welcome refresher.  The juice was outstanding for pineapple juice and had less gunk floating in it than other types I've had.

review/summary: Seriously, this is pretty bad
review/text: Ok. So all I wanted was a simple way to get some good for you pineapple without the mess. The answer... Canned Pineapple, right? I of course opted for Organic, because hey, at least it's better then boring ol' Dole. Boy was I disappointed. Ok, first let's talk color. The color pictured on the can's label shows pineapple that is bright yellow and vibrant. Alas, the pineapple in the can was more of n off brown see through, mutated something or other. Not yellow at all. Not bright and vibrant at all. Now let's talk taste, because even if the color was off (by a lot!) at least it still tasted good, right...? Wrong! This tasted like cheap imitation pineapple that airlines wouldn't even serve back when they served meals. I gagged at almost each bite hoping the next one would be better. These stale with almost no flavor. My Advice... buy the real stuff and slice it up or buy it already sliced. Nothing... and I do mean nothing beats the real thing. And the fact that this can says organic, don't let it fool you, it tastes awful...

review/summary: Perfumy disappointment
review/text: ***<br />Tazo's Earl Grey Black Tea is very perfumy. I am used to drinking super-premium tea that have the real bergamot added, not the essence. So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a more aromatic version of the Earl's traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot"; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as "floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon". Tazo describes the aroma as "citrus, lavender, light smoke".  You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br />***

review/summary: Organo Gold Coffee from Amazon -  a winner!!
review/text: Love this product and enjoy the taste.  I recommend only one per day<br />as it does have a de-toxifying effect. The Latte tastes wonderful and<br />is a personal favorite. The Organo Gold Black Coffee has no bitter after<br />taste at all.  I normally use creamer but could drink this without it if<br />I had to. Will order from the same seller as before and probably buy the<br />Organo Gold Black since it is a little more economical with 30 packets<br />per box. Excellent product and great taste!

review/summary: Perfect for adding flavor to dry food. Our little dog loves this stuff
review/text: I don't know a lot about dogs but I thought they ate anything. The dachshund we had growing up would eat banana peels if you left them out. We rescued a Maltese (5 years ago now) and while he is healthy, he eats when he's hungry and leaves the rest.  He's never like doggy treats, bones etc. and prefers human food/meat to anything for dogs. Since I've read dry food is best for dogs we feed him dry but again, he eats when hungry but doesn't lick his chops. Cesar is the best dog food I've found to add to the dry for taste. We get at least 4 feedings from one container, which make it pretty cheap. We simply mix a spoonful into the dry food for flavor and he's got the best of both worlds. If I could find a dry food tasty enough to be served solo, I would buy it but he eats such a small amount of food I don't mind making it tasty.

review/summary: We're both happy at long last!
review/text: I have two dogs, but only one of them eats Cesar chicken "in meaty juices" (it HAS to be the "in meaty juices kind!) and she GOBBLES IT. after years of searching for a food she'll eat to enjoy, not just eat to survive, we've finally found a winner!<br /><br /> Gigi is a 9-year-old Papillon mix who is both dainty, firecely independent, and plain fierce when she's disturbed, while 1-year-old Mini-Dachshund Sophie is a happy, bouncy, and utterly addicted to attention. Gigi spends her time under the bed, Sophie is wherever I am. What Sophie eats is actually still TBD. This is Gigi's review.<br /><br />Both of them have been picky eaters. Gigi went years on starving herself until she couldn't hold out any longer, then deigning to eat the dry food we supply between wet food dinners, even as we tried all kinds of different foods to tempt her. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH02I">Beneful Dog Food Prepared Meals Beef Stew Dog Food, 10-Ounce Plastic Containers (Pack of 8)</a> used to work now and then, and though it was expensive, we could get 3 servings from it. However, even though it had a lid, it would often grow moldy even before the next meal. So even though she liked it, it was wasted and really too expensive anyway.<br /><br />When Sohpie arrived, we'd been serving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJF62Y">Mighty Dog Hearty Pulled-Style Chicken Dinner In Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> with the longest sustained success yet, about a year. Only chicken, mind you, and it had to be the chunky in sauce kind, NOT the pate kind. Well, along came the puppy, and Gigi expressed her distaste by wasting food again.<br /><br />Finally, I've found Cesar. And oddly, now it has to be the p�t&eacute; kind, I.e. "in meaty juices" NOT the chunky kind! But AT LAST we've found a dog food that The Mrs. will absolutely SNARF ON. She doesn't come up for air when I put any chicken-based "in meaty juices" Cesar dinner in front of her, which I cube into bite sizes.<br /><br />The added bonus is that I can hide pills in the cubes. Gigi's been diagnosed with congenital heart failure, and she's on 3 different pills, 3 times a day. Dinner is the easier dose, because I just push the little pills into the soft p�t&eacute;, and she's none the wiser because she swallows the cubes almost whole! Sadly, we won't probably have Gigi with us for the fourteen or fifteen years I've been blessed to have spent with my previous dogs. But I'm determined to make sure she's as healthy and happy as possible in the time we have. She may be feisty, prickly, and a loner, but when I *can* catch her, she does love to snuggle with her mama.<br /><br />Cesar "in nearby juices" dog food might just give me a few month's more snuggled than we'd otherwise have.

review/text: I have a 5 lb Maltese who eats more like a cat. He eats until he is full and walks away. Dry food is best, I am told but it so.... "dry". I don't want to give him human food because I'm told I shouldn't - but also because he eats so little, I want to be sure he's healthy. My solution has been to buy Cesar by the case from Amazon (auto shipment) and mix it with his dry. I buy dry food for small adult dogs, mix a scoop (1 cup?) with 1/4-1/3 container of Cesar. I mix it with a for or my hands (so he doesn't just eat the Cesar and walk away). He gets the benefit of dry food for his teeth etc and the tastiness of Cesar's wonderful flavors.

review/text: I buy these for my friends who don't smoke and the nicotine makes them sick from some of my other shisha. In short these are the MOST flavorful and give off the best SMOKE. Perfect for smoke tricks and a great taste. I even mix them with other things and they still amaze me with how much flavor they give off.

review/summary: Best bulk rate
review/text: These pouches have a tendency to be quite expensive if you go to places like Petco or small boutiques. Our cats personally like all of the flavors that these Wellness pouches come in but we try to order the grain free ones. We don't give them the whole pouch at once and even when they stay in the pouch they don't get as crusted over and stale as when they are in the can. Feeding your cats on the pouches alone however can become rather expensive and we normally supplement the pouches with dry food.

review/text: If it were up to my cat this would get 10 stars.  He is 15 years old and has decided he doesn't want kibble anymore and this is the only soft food he likes (Wellness Healthy Indulgence Grain Free pouches).  When I have tried other soft food he loses weight because he refuses to finish it or to eat it at all.  I guess he knows what food is the healthiest!<br /><br />I gave this only 4 stars because of the price.

review/summary: Princess: "Do I love this? YES!"
review/text: When Princess came to me, she was on mostly dry food. She didn't seem to interested in her food, and used to dump it into her water before eating it. Her previous foster mum suggested I get her moist food. Then started the search. I purchased cans and pouches. And she didn't seem to interested in most of them. I did find pouches she liked, but they were discontinued. So I found these, and Princess just love them!<br /><br />The thing that Princess likes is the texture. The pouch consists of a square of grain-free food and sauce. The square is about 1cm by 1 cm. The recommendation is to give one pouch per 4 pounds per day, which should be 2 pouches for my 9 pound cat. Well, I tried that, but she put on weight. So I give her 1 pouch per day, plus as much grain free dry food as she likes. She's lean and active, and loves her pouches. I pay an arm and a leg for it, but as long as my Princess is happy, I cannot complain. I've tried cans in the same brand, and she just looks at me like I am crazy. She definitely love this brand, and get different taste every day. And a happy cat makes a happy mum :)

review/summary: My Cats Love This
review/text: All three of my cats love this food, this is the only food that they'll finish off in one sitting!<br /><br />My cats were mostly on Pate Style but I was frustrated because I was throwing a lot of it away because they wouldn't finish it all, so I decided to try this out. I purchased a few different flavors but they prefer Tuna the best. They'll eat the Salmon & Tuna but not with as much gusto as the regular Tuna flavor.<br /><br />My female cat who has strange ways of eating her food did not appreciate the size of the chunks so before I opened up the pouch, I squished the food so it was not in large pieces. This also helps the the gravy absorb in the food so it's not a soup. I now squeeze the pouches for all my cats, they like it better this way.<br /><br />Also, if it stays at the $28.56 price on Amazon, it's the exact same price in the stores.

review/summary: Surprising Results
review/text: I was looking for a new cat food for my cat who is almost 2 years old - he enjoyed his old food, but after reading some articles on the differences in some popular brands I felt compelled to give him a more nutritious product that contained less fillers. I searched online to learn about a variety of product and decided that Wellness was the way to go.<br /><br />My cat isn't picky about his food per se, but he does have distinct likes and dislikes, he loves this stuff! I switched him to 1/2 cup Wellness Dry food and 1/2 pouch of Wellness Healthy Indulgence.  He always eats the gravy first and then will come back for the meat chunks but he eats everything without fail.<br /><br />The results are what have made me a convert and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. My cat's coat is incredibly soft now and he remains active, alert, and very energetic (not overly!).  The coat is really the one place I see a significant change - he had a great coat before, but after a few weeks on this Wellness combo his coat is even softer and vibrant.

review/summary: If the Princess likes it, so do I.
review/text: Princess gets a pouch of food every morning. I rotate so she doesn't have to get the same every day. She usually have three different at any given time. This was the first time I purchased Turkey and Duck. These seem to be harder to get out of the pouch than the others I've tried.<br /><br />I first shake the pouch to get everything to settle in the bottom, then I pull it open. So far, so good. But when I then turn it over, the food gets "stuck" in the pouch a bit. So I usually make sure I open the opening first and shake it a little bit around, turn it on its head, and start milking it out. That seems to work.<br /><br />The Princess seems to like it, so I will continue buying.

review/summary: The BEST food for your cats
review/text: When we adopted our cats several years ago, our vet told us it was really important to feed them wholesome food from the beginning (they were kittens at the time).  She recommended Wellness brand, so we picked up several of the flavors of both wet and dry food for the cats to try.<br /><br />Both of our cats immediately loved the "nuggets in gravy" style wet food over the more common pate style and we haven't tried a flavor that they won't eat (although they do strongly prefer the seafood flavors over chicken or turkey).  I like the fact that the ingredients are whole foods - no fillers or cheap grains.  Although not in this combination, they're foods I eat myself - salmon, cranberries, flaxseed, zucchini, etc.<br /><br />I consider this food a win-win because the cats love the taste and texture and I love that they are eating whole foods that contribute to their silky, shiny coats and general well-being.

review/text: I decided it was time to start feeding my senior cat a wet food diet. She has a tendency to turn her nose up at most of the "healthy" choices, but she absolutely devoured this one. Several months later, she is still loving it and practically licks the bowl clean!  It has made a world of difference in her energy level, her coat is shiny and it has cut down on the amount of waste in the litter box.  The ingredients are all natural and my vet recommended this as one of the top choices of wet food for my cat.<br /><br />The food is in smaller size chunks with a LOT of gravy.  The pouch is easy to rip open, or can be cut. I highly recommend it as a healthy choice and for your finicky feline :)

review/text: My cat loves the tuna recipe so much, it is the only food she'll gobble down in a single sitting.  Interestingly, she doesn't to be as keen on the other flavors.<br />She seems to especially enjoy the gravy, almost slurping it down!<br />I give her one pouch a day and free-feed her dry, grain-free kibble.  She's healthy and lean, and her coat is silky and luxurious.<br />Maybe it's because I once owned a 96-pound Labrador that ate me out of house and home, but I cannot understand why people would think spending $1 and change per day to feed a pet is expensive...<br />For the price of a soda, you can feed your beloved pet a grain-free, quality cat food.  In reality, the junky, mass-marketed supermarket brands are a real waste of money, because you are paying for filler ingredients and added junk.<br />$1.20 a day is a bargain for the convenience, the quality, what it does for my cat, and how much she enjoys it. I certainly fitter away more than that each day on myself, in the way of "indulgences"!<br />I know that the economy is bad and there are certainly a lot of people who have fallen on hard times, but for those who can afford to keep a pet in the first place, the cost of higher quality food shouldn't be a deterrent.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I originally became a fan of pouch-based cat food with the Nutro line of pouches. However, Nutro was especially hit by the nasty recall episode from a few years back where a number of pet food manufacturers had contamination issues, and they eventually pulled their pouches. I tried a bunch of canned foods afterwards, but my cats never warmed to any of them like they did the pouches.<br /><br />Wellness came out with their "healthy indulgence" line of pouch foods not too long ago, and interestingly the packaging is pretty much identical to the Nutro products, down to the notches to facilitate tearing. I can only imagine that they are using the same manufacturing facilities as Nutro did, but hopefully with a superior product. Everything I've read about Wellness suggests that they make high-quality pet foods. My cats seem to love these as much as they did their old pouch foods. They have now been eating pouch foods almost daily for at least 6-7 years, so I don't have any major concerns about long-term health issues.<br /><br />Overall, these pouches are great. Each single pouch is one serving for one cat, so the costs do add up fast if you have multiple cats and serve this twice a day. I give dry food in the morning and the pouches at night to help conserve costs, but they always finish the Wellness pouches within a half hour, whereas the dry food often sits around unfinished all day. Another plus is that no spoons or forks need to be involved, since you just tear each pouch and shake the contents into the bowl. No mess or debates with spouses about putting cat food forks into the dishwasher with the rest of the dishes!

review/summary: Tasty, Grain-Free, and a hit with my cats
review/text: My boyfriend bought a pack as a one-off to tempt his aged kitty- who can be finicky- into eating. His Kitty was uninterested at the time, so I took it home to my little eating machine, who wolfed it down. She's been eating Wellness products almost exclusively for the past two years, and I was interested in finding a gravy-rich wet food in this line. The tuna chunks are substantial - but not too big - and are in a thick, rich gravy. I feed her a mix of 1 pouch of wet food and 1/2 cup of dry daily, and she is both happy and of normal weight. I highly recommend this food for being grain-free, as my cat has had issues with extra fiber clogging her digestive tract in the past, and free of odd, unrecognizable (and unpronounceable) ingredients.

I've stopped going through the hassle of making homemade baked beans...the Smokehouse Tradition Grillin' Beans are so much better than homemade.<br /><br />Serving Size: 1/2 cup<br />Calories: 160<br />Total fat: 1g<br />Saturated fat: 0g, Trans fat: 0g, Cholesterol 0<br />Sodium: 570mg 24%<br />Total Carbohydrates 34g<br />~Dietary Fiber: 5g<br />~Sugars 15g<br />Protein: 7g<br />Calcium: 6%<br />Iron 6%<br /><br />Ingredients: Prepared white beans, water, brown sugar, onion, bell pepper, sugar, tomato puree, salt, modified food starch, vinegar, bacon & bacon fat, white distilled vinegar, natural flavor, spices, autolyzed yeast, molasses, caramel color, natural smoke flavor

review/text: I love this sugar, but I get the same brand at Walmart for $3.54 for 44 ounces. I wouldn't buy at this price unless you cannot find it cheaper else where.

review/summary: Good but overpriced
review/text: I like this stuff and use all the time...but the price is way high. Was thinking to buy here in bulk and save a few $$'s, but no way.....I buy at Meyer store for 2.99 for 2 lb bag.
