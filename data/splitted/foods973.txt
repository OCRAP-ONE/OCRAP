review/summary: Just like I remembered them as a kid!
review/text: I used to play with and chew these gum cigarettes as a kid (I grew up in the 80's). These are exactly like the ones we had then. You can blow the powdered sugar (or what we pretended was smoke as kids) out of them a few times, before peeling them and chewing the gum. Glad I could find these and share the tradition with my kid. I told her these were the only "cigarettes" I'd ever approve of...lol

review/summary: Great gum! Just like i remember!
review/text: One word: Amazing! These gum cigarettes are chewy and delicious not to mention super fun to "smoke" :P I don't get how people say that If you had these when you were a kid you would grow up a smoker. I used to get these all the time from the ice cream truck when i was 7 or 8 years old and my mom would buy me them when I was 3. I grew up "smoking" these all the time and have not smoked a cigarette or any drug for that matter. I think it all depends how you were raised. Almost, everyone in my family has or still smokes, I was raised around smokers and still don't smoke. I don't see why people smoke but that's out of topic lol These gum cigarettes are great fun! They have a "poof" of smoke and come in different flavors as well. The pink gum flavor is a little hard at first but then gets soft after a couple of chews. Definitely, recommended item [:

review/summary: Rite of passage
review/text: Okay, so they aren't politically correct!  I personally believe you can't go through childhood without a pack of bubble gum cigarettes.  It is a given. These came super fast, were a great price, and exactly as I remembered.  It is hard (as one reviewer mentioned) to find these particular cigarettes.  They puff a bit of smoke one time, and then you chew them.  I bought these for the grandkids, gave a few out to kids I knew on Halloween.  We had a ball!  I grew up in the 50's, and I don't smoke.  I wouldn't let the kids run around school or the mall puffing on these, but they are fun and a good chew as well!  Funny, because none of my kids smoke either, so my grand kids like the gum factor of these more than the cigarette factor. My 6 year old grand daughter didn't even know what they were, LOL.

review/summary: Butterscotch Buttons? There is NONE Better!
review/text: Who doesn't love Brachs Butterscotch hard candy? I grew up on these things. They are the only butterscotch discs I know of that get their flavor from REAL BUTTER, not the artificial flavors and colors found in competitor products. You really can taste the difference!<br /><br />It's sad that these are so difficult to find. I guess nowadays, stores are more interested in how much profit they can make rather than providing a quality, American product. These candies are worthy of being on the top-shelf everywhere candy is sold. Everyone at my home and office loves them.<br /><br />I'm so glad I found them here on Amazon. I plan to buy more in the future. You'd think a bag of candy that is almost 7 lbs would last a while, but at the rate my family and fellow employees are loving them, I may have to order more much sooner than I thought!<br /><br />These are a bit more expensive than other butterscotch discs. But, it is sooo worth getting the REAL deal!<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />20110902 - My boss was heartbroken when he walked into my office to check the candy dish and found I was out of these. I immediately got on and ordered more. Now, it will ship with Prime. It is less expensive and will be here in 2 days! Go Amazon! Oh by the way, these are no longer made in the USA. On this bulk bag, it says, "Product of Argentina." They are still quite delicious but I knocked 1 star off for that.

review/text: I love Brachs butterscotch & they are so hard to find so when I found them in my local albertsons I was ecstatic. Well that was short lived because the original Brachs butterscotch that has the yellow wrapper with blue writing no longer exists!! The new version sucks!! The taste is different as well as the texture and I hate them! Ill never understand why companies feel the need to change products that are not broken. I'm very upset bc the original was amazing and anyone who loved them will notice the horrible change in the new version. Bad move Brachs!!

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I got addicted to a butterscotch candy at my dollar store and Werther's when I could afford it.  My dollar store ran out and WM ran out of Werther's.  So, I went online and I liked the ingredients and reviews of this candy.  I love it!  It certainly tastes better than the dollar store candy and I prefer it over Werther's.<br /><br />When I received my order, I thought it would last forever, but I now will be placing my second order!  The first sensation, for me, was tasting the real butter.  It is a smooth, great tasting butterscotch candy that lasts a long time, if you just let it melt in your mouth.  In fact, I wouldn't risk a crown trying to bite into it!  If you are a cruncher, wait until it is about half way melted and then take a large drink of ice water.  Then, you can crunch away without dental damage!<br /><br />It is rare to find a product that uses real ingredients.  I haven't tried all of the other butterscotch candies here as I'm afraid of buying something that doesn't taste as good as this one!

You only have one life and mine is going to have Brach's Butterscotch Hard Candy in it even if I have to go on-line to find it.

I actually bought one of these tarts before I went raw vegan, I was still eating eggs, meat the typical SAD diet and I thought it was one of the best desserts I've ever had! Even my mom thinks these tarts are delicious!!! I really can't even describe Hail Merry tarts and do them justice other than to say there's gourmet deliciousness in every bite! I hope they come out with other flavors, I don't do caffeine anymore so I can't eat the chocolate tarts anymore (they are outstanding too) so it'd be nice to have another flavor or two to choose from. Maybe a strawberry tart or peach! YUMMY!... LOVE YOU MAKERS OF HAIL MERRY PRODUCTS!!!

review/summary: Very bland.  For the price won't buy again
review/text: I'm not on a low sodium diet, but learning to eat better so limiting my sodium intake.  I was actually eying this product for awhile before ordering it because I personally love potatoes.  No salt?  Great.  All organic?  Wonderful!  $2 a can?  Kinda pricy.  But wanted a healthy soup to add to my brown rice.<br /><br />After putting it in the microwave for 3 minutes, which is what I always do with soups, it came out looking like mush and tasted like it also. I have 11 more cans to go through though so bought some hot sauce, going to try chili powder and pepper.  As for the looks, I don't mind so much if it fills me up and healthy for me.<br /><br />The lack of flavor and having to find things to add to it makes it not worth the cost for me.  The killer is, out of the 12 pack, a single can wasn't dented.  The packaging was fine so I doubt they were damaged when shipped.  I also ordered the chicken noodle soup from the same brand, but I haven't tried that yet.  Same problem with the denting.<br /><br />Would I recommend?  Nope.  I'll never order again unless the price drops to $1-$1.50 a can.  Even then, anticipate being creative to make it work for you.  I have 11 more cans to go through.  Personally I'll just stick with steamed veggies on my rice instead of this product.

Serious good value for the money, a ton of gum. Three different flavors, tropical, strawberry, and original. I'm not sure what all the negative reviews are about, because I got exactly what I ordered and the gum is delicious. People are too funny talking about taste wearing off quickly. Any gum you can buy loses taste a while after you chew it.. Especially if its fruity gum. The gum seems to last a long time to me and my family flavor wise.<br /><br />Regardless, dontt let the others fool you.. I got exactly what was described, very quickly I might add..

review/summary: Great treats
review/text: My dogs love these treats and so do I.  They are small enough to give as training treats and are swallowed quickly.  If a few are a bit big they are easy to break into smaller pieces without crumbling to dust.  They aren't too smelly, and they aren't at all greasy on my hands.  They contain no additives!  The perfect treat for dogs with allergies!<br /><br />The company is great to deal with.<br /><br />We give this product four paws up!

review/summary: pups love it, easy to handle, not too much smell
review/text: Bought these in July 2012. I included two pics, so you can see the bag and the size of the dehydrated tripe nuggets. Tripe is a highly nutritious treat, so our girls just get two of these pieces as their evening snack. They love them! There is 5 ounces of dehydrated product in this bag, it says "product of USA" on the bag, and I like the size of the nuggets. There is a little smell, as there should be - it's TRIPE! but it's not overwhelming. We will buy these again. I feel that they are a quality treat.

Its my favorite food in the universe (yes for me, it even beats medium cooked steak). Unfortunately in Seattle I have had a lot of trouble finding it. Its available very rarely in some seasons.<br /><br />I stumbled upon these on amazon and ordered 12 cans that arrived in two days. Here is how I made it<br />1.) Heated oil<br />2.) Fried pieces of garlic, ginger and chopped green pepper.<br />3.) Added red chilli pepper<br />4.) Added one can and let it cook for 5 minutes.<br /><br />And the result is nothing short of phenomenal. The taste was so amazing that I had tears of joy. I cannot stop thinking about it and cannot stop eating. I am hooked!<br /><br />All I need to do is to figure out how to order enough to last me for a lifetime.

It would be perfect over rice.  Or over chicken thighs.  It has a perfect blend of mild Indian spices.<br /><br />It has a fatal flaw that makes me limit my intake:  It is way too salty.  This is not just my imagination.  The whole can would have over 2,000 mg of sodium.  Because of that I ration my intake.<br /><br />If the manufacturer reads this, perhaps they can cut back on the salt by about 40%  I imagine it would be just as good.<br /><br />Also, I don't know if this is a storage problem or not, but the cans look as if they either are old or have been stored in a damp place.

review/text: I love this product, been buying it in my local store for a couple of years. It's becoming harder to find, but I'm not sure I'm ready to pay this much for it, in bulk no less.<br /><br />My prep for this dish: bone-in chicken thighs & half a large onion, cooked in a pressure cooker until really soft. Pull the meat off the bones and add to the sauce with onion pieces and use a touch of the cooking water to thin it to the right consistency. Add a few tbsp. of sour cream, or yogurt, whatever you have, and a dose of garam masala or your favorite curry powder, simmer, eat on Naan.<br /><br />The flavor right out of the can is good but a little acidic to my taste. I like rounding it out with all the extras. Be careful adding spicy, I feel like the heat level is inconsistent from can to can - sometimes it's really pretty spicy to begin with, and I regret the touch of cayenne I added.

Be warned that the main ingredients in QBubble's boba mixes are sugar, tea mix, powdered dairy creamer (which probably means trans fats), and flavoring (whatever that may entail)- overall not the ingredients that indicate a healthy drink.<br /><br />The Lavender flavor itself is interesting. To me, it tastes similar, but not the same, as Earl Gray tea with cream.  If you don't like Earl Gray, I would suggest avoiding Lavendaer Boba tea.

review/summary: Perfect to grab on the way to brunch so you don't have to eat high fructose corn syrup.
review/text: I bought this item because about half the week I eat out for breakfast and half the week I eat at home.  When I eat out I HATE the idea of consuming high fructose corn syrup mixed in with a little bit of fruit or fruit flavor.  Everything about breakfast at my favorite restaurants is perfect except the jam.  I usually go to Corner Bakery if I have to be at Northwestern in Chicago extra Early-- Or grab breakfast at Nookies in boystown in Chicago (another favorite place of mine to eat).  Only thing bad about breakfast at these and most all other places is CHEAP sad fructose syrup jam.<br /><br />NOW with this Bonne Maman small jars of jam- made with fresh raspberries and real cane sugar I can FULLY enjoy my breakfasts out.  Just throw one in your coat pocket or bag and go.  These are small and east to carry and a pleasure to put on your toast and eat while you are eating out.  And they taste great! Why compromise your taste?  You have a good jam at home and a sucky one at the restaurant???  Why?  This is your solution.  Worked for me...  I'm about to order my second box.  LOVE THEM!

review/summary: I loved it
review/text: I popped some last night and I love this popcorn. If you like large poofy kernels then this is not for you, but I like small kernel popcorns too, and this one was light and a little crunchy and had good flavor. I think the selling point of this type is that the hulls shatter when it pops ("hullless"), so that you don't get the big painful pieces of hard popcorn hull in your teeth like with larger varieties. I think the popcorn kernels have to be small to be hullless.<br /><br />If you have an air popper and find that small kernel popcorns fly out of it, you could try a different cooking method - I just pop mine in a saucepan on the stove (with a little bit of vegetable oil, and a lid to keep it from flying out), there are also air poppers that don't let the popcorn fly out, or I've seen a microwave bowl that's like air popping but with the microwave as a heat source (but no added oil or anything, like air popping), or some people even just use a paper bag in the microwave (I think with this method they use a little oil too). There are many ways to cook popcorn, and instructions are pretty easy to find on the internet if you need them.

review/text: This popcorn has hulls, which I don't care for. It's not labeled as hulless, so it's not deceptive. I just thought for the price it would be - my bad. I only use the whilry pop popper, so this review is relevant to that method only. It produces somewhat light, crispy popcorn of fairly large size with a real popcorn taste. I did think it would pop larger though. It's good for the coated popcorns I like to make. It's not the best I've tasted though. Fireworks makes some delicious, hulless varieties that have spoiled me, I'm afraid. The company ships fairly fast, and the shipping cost is what I'd expect it to be. I'm ruined by Amazon Prime though, so to pay any shipping at all is a drawback; that being said, for this quality popcorn plus the S&H cost, I won't buy it again - simple as that - and for no other reason than that.

We have always used popcorn from the grocery store but the Amish Country Lady Finger Popcorn is so far superior to the store bought. The flavor was so good you did not have to use butter and it was a delight to eat, both in taste and texture. The husk of the corn seemed to disappear and left almost nothing that you had to dig out from between you teeth. I give this product FIVE STARS.

review/text: Even "no hull" popcorn has hulls.  It has to so it can contain the moisture in the kernel and cause the popcorn to POP.  "No hull" popcorn has a hull that shatters when the popcorn pops so the hull isn't as noticeable.  There's no guarantee that every hull will shatter into "invisible" pieces.  So ALL popcorn varieties have a hull.  With some varieties you just don't notice it as much.

review/text: I was interested with the fact that this popcorn is supposed to pop with less hull. However, I read that the popcorn also pops smaller as a consequence. I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I placed the order, but I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />The kernels pop to about the size of a penny on average, which is smaller than what I'm used to. However, I wind up just eating handfuls of it anyway. The hulls are in fact definitely less pervasive, which is a huge plus. Hulls and old maids are a huge turn me off for me from regular popcorn.<br /><br />I use an elecrtic oil based popper. There are always some unpopped or barely popped kernels. However, this is the first type of kernel I've tried with this popper, so I'm not sure which is at fault. Even still, some old maids are to be expected with any popcorn. Most of it pops fine.

review/summary: Great, but not for an air popper for sure
review/text: This popcorn is excellent. My husband and I love the taste and we don't mind eating several pieces at a time to make up for the tiny size. I rarely have any hulls when eating this, but when I do, they don't get stuck in my teeth. However, I could see why these would never work for an air popper. They are far too light and would never stay in the chamber long enough to pop. If you have a stovetop or electric popper (like I have) this is definitely worth a try.

review/text: When I was a child, my grandmother got some popcorn sent to her straight from the fields in Missouri.  It was white and SO tasty it didn't need butter or salt.  I've been on a search to find more ever since.<br /><br />This isn't it.<br /><br />The kernels are quite small but, worst of all, only about 40% of them pop.  That's a lot of "old maids" and makes this tuff pricey indeed.<br /><br />I contacted the seller with the issue; they told me to pop it at a lower microwave setting -- didn't help.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars only because what did pop was OK-tasting.<br /><br />Keep looking...

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: I ordered Snappy white popcorn, mushroom popcorn and this bag of Lady Finger popcorn all from Amazon.  So far I've reviewed the Snappy white (wonderful).  I tried this Lady Finger corn today.  I measured the oil, popcorn and Flavorcol so that my sloppy technique of eye-balling the amounts wouldn't mess it up.  It popped quickly in my Whirly-Pop popper and the kernels were a nice, appealing yellow color.  As stated in their description, these are tiny, tiny kernels that produce tiny, tiny popcorn.  They were fairly tender and tasty but a bit chewy.  They are supposed to be "hullless."  I'm not sure I agree with that but it is true that the hulls don't pop off and land in the bottom of the bowl.  The hulls stick to the kernels which is what makes them sort of chewy.  I will use these up but I probably won't buy more.  Kids may like the tiny kernels more than I did. I found them messy to eat because I kept dropping them.  My dog loved the ones I dropped!  I also had only about a dozen unpopped kernels.

review/text: The kernels are very small, much smaller than movie theater popcorn. There are also a lot more unpopped kernels and because the popcorn is so small, it tastes like I'm eating larger hulls because the ratio of kernel to hull is closer. This is the worst of the three Amish flavors I tried, with Baby White as the clear winner. Skip this and go straight to Baby White.

My family was laughing at me when I began to make the second latte! They have seen me down matcha before but never quite as fast as this one!<br />Its sweet but not cloying whatsoever, tastes like something one picked fresh from the tree or ummm garden? Do figs grow on trees? I need to look that up! I have had fig only in a few forms before - jams, canned which were whole figs, and in puddings, but I am positive this is the best tasting fig ever for me!<br /><br />I think this may become one I keep as a permanent selection in my stash. I am not sure I would say it is better than macadamia nut or butterscotch but its up there with them maybe number 3 or 4 in my favorites. I have been drinking so many new ones as I collect them that I need to go back and try some of my first matcha again.<br /><br />I have also been sending out a ton of samples but its getting to that point I can't share as much anymore because my stash is beginning to thin lol.<br /><br />I'm at the place of deciding my favorites and keeping only those in stock. This will be one of those.<br />So I was surprised as I really did not expect to love this one quite so much, actually I thought I would probably not favor it but alas I do. Go fig!

review/text: This is a very glutenous rice also known as sticky or sweet rice (it is not sweet but used to make sweet treats).  I got addicted to this in Japan and found it in Hawaii but not in the grocery stores near my house.<br /><br />The best way to cook this rice is to soak it in water for at least a few hours (sometimes over night) and then steam it for 30 minutes.  I make a large bunch this way and then when I want a serving I just resteam it for about 5 minutes.  It's so delicous especially topped with some madras lentils.

I tried the hand-made mochi at a festival there, as well as the store bought, and have to say that my little pounding machine and this rice make mochi comparable to the hand-made.  I've ventured into making my own flavours, including a delicious chocolate mochi, as well as plain that I wrap in nori and eat with soy sauce.  This mochi produces sticky, stretchy, firm mochi that toasts up perfectly.  Delicious!

review/summary: Do NOT order a 3 pound bag of these...
review/text: So...  A co-worker of mine mentioned how delicious "those little random glazed morsels" were inside the giant tub of assorted Poker Mix we kept in the office.  But what the hell were they?  A quick internet search led us to these wholesale honey roasted sesame chips.  We thought, what the hell...  instead of diggin through useless pretzels and bland azz rice puffs in hopes of scoring one of these gems in your handful of snackage, lets order JUST the good stuff.  Scratch that.  Let's order a sh!tload of the good stuff -- make it a 3 lbs bag.<br /><br />I placed the order, anxiously awaiting each day's FedEx shipment in hopes it would arrive. Much hype had built up around the ensuing delivery and as fate would have it the package arrived on a day when I was one of the few folks in the office.  This presented a perfect opportunity for me to commandeer the package and place it stategically on my desk within arms reach for constant munching -- with noone else around to get in the way and ruin my snackin rhythm.  And so I ate...  and ate some more...  and a couple more after that.  Fast-forward to the end of the day...  I've completely OD's on these god-awful things.  A terrible aftertaste lingers well into the night, along with some serious heartburn.<br /><br />DAY TWO...  I can't even look at these things.  Everyone else in the office is pretty excited about them though.  "Oooooh, these are pretty good -- what are they?"  "Yummy..."  "It's like a tongue kissing an angel..."<br /><br />WEEK 3...  Everyone in the cubicles surrounding my immediate area has had it with these godd@mn things.  I've finally managed to pawn the remainder off onto our Director of Network Operations, who graciously accepted my "gift" and carried them over to his side of the office.  Sure -- I feel bad passing the hot potato off to him, but at this point it was us or them.  I'm basically a hero, the way I see it...  I saved lives over here.<br /><br />AND SO, THE MORAL BEING...  Yeah, they're ok in small doses.  But at the end of the day they're best left as the amusing but rarely seen supporting character in some marginal sitcom.  IE, sesame chips are well placed as a rarely occuring morsel in some party mix, but NOT as the featured star of a snack extravaganza.  And whatever you do...  DO NOT GET THE GIANT 3 POUND BAG!!!

review/text: If you like theater popcorn you're going to love this oil for popping corn. It's the same oil used by the movie theaters only better because you control the amount of oil that you use. Add Flavacol Popcorn Seasoning salt to the oil (while popping) and you're in for a real treat. WARNING: While I love this popcorn oil these particular containers do not ship well in warm weather. When the oil is warm it is in liquid form and the containers are not sealed very well. Chances are you will have leaks during shipping and then ants by the time you open it up. (As it was for me) Better to order the 1 gallon container which is sealed better or wait for cooler months when the oil is in solid form and won't leak.

One greyhound has an allergy to beef. All 3 of my dogs love this food, and no diarrhea even though I food switched without slowing introducing the new food. You can search on the web for dog food that is rated by independent groups. Merrick Whole Earth Farms Food is always a 4 or 5 star.

review/text: package was delivered quickly and product was great.  I have since found this item at a grocery nearby in the Kosher section, but the bulk option is nice if you cook for large groups or want to share with friends.

review/summary: I just loved it!!!
review/text: I tried a different great recipes made from Israeli Couscous by other people and had a hard time to find it anywhere in the store. After I ordered the Roland's couscous on Amazon.com, I am cooking with it all the time and my husband loves it as well... Thanks - great alternative to a pasta, side dish or as a base to any seafood salads you may think of...
