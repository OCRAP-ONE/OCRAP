review/summary: Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai
review/text: What I was expecting was a chai tea similar to one I find in popular coffee houses: a spiced tea infused with cream and sugar. This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Timothy's, Bigelow and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test. The K-cup chais are simply not the same as the coffee house chais. To approximate the coffee house chai you'll need to add your own cream/milk and sugar/honey and give it a little shake.

review/summary: Delicious with 5 spice aromas, not full of sugar and cream
review/text: This India Spice Chai while brewing fills the whole room with wonderful aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves almost like the Chinese 5 spice blend.  There is no added sugar or cream so if you want that go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030GQHXA">Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack</a>.  Those k-cups which are delicious as well have the cream that many expect in a chai tea.  This particular brand of Celestial Seasonings is just tea.  You can add what you want after the fact.  I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing.  This is just a nice cup of spiced tea.  It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most. I really like it and highly recommend.

review/summary: Converted me to tea over coffee - it's that good
review/text: Before buying my Keurig brewer, I never really like black tea.  I would drink herbal tea from tme to time but black tea always seemed too bitter.  After trying Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast Tea, I was instantly converted.  There is no bitter taste and it's so much less acidic than coffee and therefore much easier on my stomach.  It has a mild, slightly fruity taste that is perfect with breakfast or really anytime of day.  I've tried it plain and with a bit of milk and sugar as well.  I honestly have become more of a tea drinker than coffee drinker since trying this delicious tea.

Another plus is that you don't have to wait for the tea to brew. Using the 10oz setting is just right for me. If you want a stronger brew then use the 8oz setting.

review/summary: Where's The Cardamon?  Prepare for the Cloveaload!
review/text: If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you.  If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is "this is NOT chai tea."  There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea.  As it is, it should be called "spicy clove tea."  This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices.  It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves.  I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region.  Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors.  Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision.  I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically.<br /><br />I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a "traditional" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand.  For all the people out there who know what Indo-Pakistani Chai tastes like, I'll be reviewing each of the "chai" K-Cups according to how they resemble the original.

review/summary: Great for regular chai or latte
review/text: I love this chai, and it makes a much better chai latte than I've tried in any k-cup before.  To be clear, this doesn't come with powdered milk or cream, so you have to add your own cream in order to make it a latte.<br /><br />I have disliked all of the pre-mixed latte k-cups I've tried because of a combination of artificial sweatener (which they all seem to insist on adding) and the powdered creamer (which is worse than fresh).  I add my own sugar and cream to this chai, and it is delicious!<br /><br />When I tried this without cream and sugar, it tasted slightly heavy on the clove.  With the cream and sugar, though, I don't have any complaints.

I've had this brand/flavor in the bags before (although not recently) and liked it just fine.  Even bought it multiple times.  Not sure what is not working right with the k-cup formula.

You may not prefer as weak a tea, but that can be solved by running it through only once.  It has a clean, refreshing flavor.

So when I saw they had them in the K-cups, I immediately jumped on them and ordered a box. I was so disappointed in it. It tastes nothing like their regular tea bag version. Weak is a word I would use. And I'm not sure what kind of spices they put it in, but it's nothing like any other chai tea I've had. I do not recommend this brand. If you're a regular chai drinker, you will notice the difference and likely be disappointed.

Best of all, it's pure tea and spices, unlike the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte, which is full of artificial ingredients.

review/text: I'm an avid chai drinker--many different varieties of both lattes and straight black tea.  We purchased this product because we noticed that the Cafe Escapes chai lattes--a sweeter, creamier blend--did not actually have much black tea in it, and we still wanted our morning caffeine.  Neither my husband nor I could finish one mug of this stuff, and we will end up getting rid of the box.  It was that awful. There was none of the subtle spice blending--just a watery slightly clove-tasting flavor undercut by a bitterness that almost had hints of coffee. Adding a little milk, as we usually do, didn't help at all.  If you enjoy chai, I'd recommend Bigalow or Tazo and skip this one.

review/text: I stumbled upon Celestial Seasonings Green Tea k-cups at my workplace, and since have fallen in love.  For a nice, quick cup of green tea, I haven't found any better solution.  I have fancier or more old fashioned tea brewing methods that I use when I have more time, but I default to this green tea when I need a quick fix.<br /><br />Now about the tea specifically - I have tried other green tea k-cups (competing brands), and none have been as clean-tasting and crisp as Celestial Seasonings.  I will continue to purchase this brand for my green tea needs.

review/text: The Celestial Seasonings authentic green tea k-cup is very good.  One K-cup makes adequate flavor of 9.25 oz. of hot tea.  Most of the k-cup assorted coffee produces light, watery coffee at 7.25 oz., but this green tea has  good color and taste even at the max. 9.25 oz.  I would recommend this green tea k-cup.

review/text: I enjoy chai tea very much and my partner drinks only tea, no coffee. So when we purchased our Keurig, we wanted to try several varieties of chai to find the perfect one. I shopped on amazon and bought several types with  reviews, cost, recognizable brand and speed of shipping being accounting factors ( in that order).<br /><br />Pros: Quick delivery<br />  The description is accurate and you get exactly what is advertised<br />  Known brand<br />  Fresh<br />  The price is moderate<br /><br />Cons: I mention price here again because it is cheaper in other forms ( tea bags)<br /><br />I prefer a non milk based Chai and so this was the ideal for me. I added sugar some days and drank it plain others and both were satsifying. My partner and I both enjoyed it above all the other flavors and I will reccomend and share with friends and family. I will continue to shop and attempt to find a better price, but would pay this again because it is worth it.

review/text: I tried this because I can't seem to find the Gloria Jean Serenity Tea which I liked very much.  The Celestial Seasonings was very very bland.  I even tried it on the smallest cup, and it made no difference.  There is no authentic flavor here.  I was brought up drinking green tea.  I especially like the Yama Moto brand green tea, but wanted something quick and easy in a k-cup. I like the Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Spice so I thought I would try the green tea.  I realize that coffee and tea are a personal preference.  For me, this green tea missed the mark completely.

review/text: I can not express how much I looove the Celestial Seasoning English Breakfast Tea K-Cups!!!  When I purchased my Keurig, I was drinking Bigelow's English Breafast tea bags which I opened and used in the My K-Cup.  I had a rebate deal that sent me 2 boxes of the Celestial Seasoning tea K-Cups and I've been hooked ever since!<br /><br />The Celestial Seasonings is much smoother than the Bigelow.  I hadn't realized how bitter the Bigelow was, I can't drink it any longer!!  I'm a purest when it comes to my black tea, I don't like too many other flavors superseding the tea.<br /><br />I wish I could get this in tea bags too (to carry in my purse when at restaurants, at friends houses and what not)!<br /><br />The Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast is just an super-enjoyable cup of tea!

The Celestial English Breakfast Black Tea has a lemon flavoring added.  Ugh ... I was really hopeful I could brew a glass of ice tea with my Keurig.  It is not bad tasting at all - it is just not what I prefer.

review/summary: Wonderful hot or cold!
review/text: This is my favorite of the K-Cup Chai recipes. The spices are balanced though fairly strong allowing this tea to hold up well with the additions of honey (or sugar) and milk. It's wonderful served hot or cold. For the cold version, add your honey (or sugar) and milk, stir, and then pour over ice. When doing the iced version, I find it works best brewed on the 6oz size and then poured over ice in a 24oz glass. I prefer this to the Chai Latte K-Cups because I can control the amount of sweetener and milk.

The flavors are light and pleasing to my palate, no nasty fake sugar aftertaste.  This is saying alot because I have several boxes of truvia at home and can't bring myself to use them in my coffee.  I highly recommend this, and am ordering it for myself and my husband to take to work, and drink on hot days.It has a light, tropical flavor, with a gentle citrus aftertaste.  I'm sold, only 30 calories per packet.

review/summary: Treats to Keep Your Spoiled Friend Trim...
review/text: My little Boston terrier loves them; it's all about the food with her and I'm glad I can give her Lean Treats when I am smitten by her adorable face without feeling like I'm doing her harm.  She's managed to keep her good figure for 2 years after her spay, and I feel they're helping.  So glad I can get these treats that I first saw at the vet's office!!

review/summary: Works great and is easy to use
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 5:00 Mins<br /><br /></span>The ekobrew cup is a great alternative to buying tons of expensive k-cups. It's easy to use and good for the environment. I love some of the k-cup flavors, and I still use them too, especially on weekends when I want to brew and go, but this is a good alternative to save a few bucks as they are easy to use - no harder than using a drip coffee filter, and they make a really good cup of coffee with the keurig.

review/summary: Essential Item for your Keurig!
review/text: If you have a Keurig or are about to purchase one, you MUST get these refillable cups as well. I love the simplicity of the Keurig and being able to make one cup of coffee at a time. However, I could not stand the plastic waste of each of the tiny k-cups for the machine. Also I wanted to be able to select my own coffees to use in the machine. Some of the samples and brands that are sold to use with this machine are simply terrible!! But with these cups you simply fill the cup with your own coffee, empty, rinse and reuse. Get the 2-pack so that you can use one and fill one at the same time.

review/summary: My coffee is better AND less expensive
review/text: I was skeptical. Would these refillable cups last with daily use?  I am pleased to report; they have done very well.  I have been using the brown cup for coffee, for about 6 months.  It does leak a bit around the lid if I over-fill the cup with coffee. I get the results I want using just one scoop of coffee and I see little or no leaking around the lid.  The mesh screen does allow more sediment to pass into my cup when I use pre-ground coffee.<br /><br />The best part: I can use my favorite coffee.  I can use my small batch roaster to make coffee my way and still enjoy the convenience and consistent quality provided by the Keurig system.<br /><br />If these cups wear out before my Keurig machine, I will replace them at once!

review/summary: Perfect for bean snobs
review/text: I bought these after my husband and I bought our keurig machine at Christmas.  We didn't like how expensive K-cups were, how wasteful they were, and that the beans we prefer weren't available in a cup.  So I got these hoping to meet in the middle.  It was the perfect solution.  After 8 mos of 3x per day use, one of them is finally in need of replacing ... it no longer snaps shut, so I'm replacing with another set.  I am EXTREMELY happy with the purchase.  The cups are simple to use, clean easily, and work great.  They make a VERY strong cup of coffee if filled to the filling point, which for us is great, but others may want to scale it back a little.  You do end up with a little bit of "grit" at the bottom of your cup where some particulate settles, but it's not full grounds, and since we also like french press coffee, that's something we are use to.

review/summary: reuseable K-Cup filter
review/text: Ordered 2 sets for 4 of these, have used for a few weeks now and they work well. Most Keurig owners should use these to save money on K-Cups and can use their favorite ground coffee again. Easy to fill, easy to clean, just rinse under running water. Makes a great cup of coffee. Only reason for 4 stars is the price. I think Ekobrew could do away with the fancy cardboard cylinder packaging and instead offer a 6 pack for $20.

review/summary: High priced store K-cups?.......not anymore
review/text: Quite simply these work like a charm. I like to brew my own (Star-you-know-what) and don't want to get ripped off by the prices of the store bought Kcups, so I thought I'd give these a try. They are awesome and work great. Be forewarned that you need to get your coffee ground with a "press grind". If you use a finer grind, the coffee won't flow nearly as well due to the fine grinds packing as it trying to shoot the water through it. I ordered a 2-pack, which works out great because you can set a used one on the counter with the lid up to let the grinds dry out while you're using the other one. The dry grinds empty from the used one easier than wet grinds do. I believe the manufacturer also recommends washing these with soap every once in a while to remove the oils from the fine mesh screens to help improve, or keep, the proper flow rate. 5 stars for sure. And oh, my machine is a Platinum Keurig.

review/text: Great concept, but thus far not so great coffee! We have tried good old Folgers Classic as well as freshly ground 8 O'Clock coffees. We have always enjoyed both brands, but we have yet to find the right combination of grinds/water with this system. Both have come out very weak. An additional peeve is the cost! The packaging and marketing babble is more costly than the little bit of plastic required for the filters! Talk about over marketing!

review/summary: Nice watered-down organic juice for little hands
review/text: Like most kids, my daughter adores juice, but I worry about her drinking too much of it.  This juice is cut with filtered water, so she is consuming less juice but doesn't realize it.  The boxes are quite small.  She likes the little Bernstein bear pictures on it and thinks she is getting a special treat.<br /><br />This product is great because it's all water and organic juice, no other "junk" inside like artificial colors or flavors.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice product!

review/summary: Great quality at a reasonable price
review/text: My local supermarket sells one ounce bags of dried oyster mushrooms for four dollars.  For a little bit more than twice the price, you get a whole pound.  They rehydrate back to near fresh quality.  I boil some water in the microwave and soak the mushroonms for about 20 minutes.  At that point, you can use the liquid to fortify a soup or gravy and cook the mushrooms as desired.<br /><br />Angelina's packs these in a plastic bag inside a cardboard box.  Four boxes fill a carton and save on shipping charges.  I mixed it up and got some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHXMCY">Woodear, First Quality - 1 Lb Bag / Box Each</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHSV5C">BOLETES, CHILEAN, FIRST QUALITY,(DRIED) 1 lb.</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHSV02">BLEND, NORTHWOODS,MUSHROOM(DRIED) 1 lb.</a>.  I would like to get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHSWSS">LOBSTER,MUSHROOM,(DRIED) 1 lb.</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YQ6TDK">Dried Morel Mushrooms 1 Lb. Bag</a> but I can't justify the high price.<br /><br />I am pleased with all of the products I received from Angelina's and will order again.

review/summary: Excellent quality re-hydrate in a flash
review/text: These are excellent quality dried mushrooms. They rehydrate in hot water (no need to use boiling hot water) in no time at all. Being dried, they of course are not the same taste or texture as fresh oyster mushrooms, but they are great - just different. Just like a dried fruit isn't the same as a fresh one, just different. I found no dirt, pebbles or sticks in them. Some of the other mushrooms from this vendor have rocks and twigs in them - not these.

The mushrooms are very tender and meaty as they should be, none of the tough rubbery dehydrated types.<br />Also, as another poster mentioned, one pound is a lot when purchased dried. Enjoy
