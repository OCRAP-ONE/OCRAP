review/summary: Easy way to make popcorn
review/text: About a year ago, I purchased a 6 oz popcorn machine for my business in order to give my customers some free snacks while they are in my store.  I purchased these 6 oz popcorn packs and love them.  I do not have to worry about portions or measuring.  Everything comes in a handy serving pack with the correct mixture.  Super easy! No mess either.  I love it!  The popcorn is delicious and I have to sometimes keep myself from eating it all.

review/text: These packets are easy to use.  Loved that.  Used them at a fundraising event.  However, I had no way to gauge how many servings each packet makes.  I would have appreciated some information about that on the Amazon page and on the packets themselves. I ordered 4 boxes and am stuck with 3.5 boxes that cannot be returned.

review/summary: Best Popcorn I've ever had
review/text: We bought a 2.5oz popcorn maker for our kids and realized all popcorn is not created equal.  Assuming the ingredients in all pre-packaged popcorn is safe, the most important thing is flavor...and Great Northern Popcorn has it.  It is sooooo good!  I was competing against the popcorn from Ace Hardware.  Before now my kids begged to go to Ace Hardware which they call "the popcorn store."  Now my kids love Great Northern popcorn from home and I'm saving tons of money not buying tools every weekend.<br /><br />Another thing we like about Great Northern Popcorn is they provide 2.5oz packages (most popcorn packs start at 4oz).<br /><br />When friends come over with their kids the popcorn maker runs non-stop.  The kids can't get enough.

review/text: I had to do quite a bit of research on which popcorn and flavoring to get with my new popcorn maker from Costco. After reading reviews on this I pulled the trigger, and I'm sure glad I did. It tastes almost exactly like the movie theater popcorn. Just add a little Orville popcorn oil on top and viola! BEST POPCORN EVER!

review/text: very happy with the popcorn.  I used it with my whirly popper stove top popcorn maker and just poured all the contents in the pot.  By having every bag sealed, you are sure that the popcorn is fresh and pops right.  the right amount of oil and seasoned salt.  No butter is added after, there is enough flavor from the oil and salt.

review/summary: Great in theory
review/text: Perhaps I got an old batch, but I found the popcorn to be a bit stale when it popped up. In terms of ease of use, nothing could be simpler. Add the oil, turn the kettle on and when it's smoking add the popcorn and seasoning (and if you're me, when it's done popping put it in a bowl, drizzle with real butter and microplaned parmigianno reggiano- OMG SOOO good). No one else has complained about it tasting stale in my house so I might just be too picky. I'm not sure if we'll buy this brand again, but in the mean time it is working fine for us.

review/summary: The real deal
review/text: This stuff is the real deal folks! You simply cannot get any closer to real, movie theater popcorn, even if you were in the theater! This stuff is that good! And at about .77/ea pack, a great deal too. I honestly have no reason to go to the theater any more! With this popcorn and the theater size candy packs available cheap at the grocery store/Wal-Mart, a case of pop and you are there for pennies on the dollar! Oh, the best part, used a plain old dutch oven on the stove top to pop the corn and it came out perfect. Literally, the BEST popcorn I have ever made, hands down.

This is exactly what I was looking for. Yes, it's a little salty, but isn't that what you expect when you eat popcorn? This is the only kind that I don't have to add salt to.

review/summary: Great taste, GOOD packaging depending on your popper!
review/text: My family and friends LOVE the taste of this popcorn and we don't have any issue with how many kernels are left over. Our issue is with the packaging. We have the 8oz Great Northern Machine, which we LOVE! But putting the oil, salt, and seeds in can be difficult because of the size of the heating element. I've found that if you carefully detatch the oil and pour that in, it gives you more room to put the rest in without getting burned. Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase. I'm only considering trying the Gold's brand because they too have had great reviews (still on the fence). But I am very pleased and MY friends and family would HIGHLY recommend!!!

Then I pour the kernels back into the packet and wait for the popcorn machine.

review/text: This stuff worked really well for a school fundraiser.  Everyone loved it and there were very few kernels left after it popped.  Others complained about the oil being solidified but that happens when it gets cold.  After we had it outside for a while it all liquified but it works fine either way, I just squeezed the package and it came right out.  Great product...I will purchase it again if we do another fundraiser.

review/text: It makes it easier to use my 8oz popper( Gold Medal 2408) But its too SALTY. The Gold Medal Seasoning Flavacol is much better. I will not get again. I have adjusted by not cutting the salt portion then adding the Gold Medal Seasoning by hand that Works better. also others have talked about old maid. that comes from the Popper design. I also had issues with those Cheaper poppers & 4oz. poppers -That's why we upgraded to the professional Brand, Gold Medal, you will pay a tad bit more, but its worth it because parts can be replaced & fixed easily + it can pop ALL day with out issues + better product (popcorn)

Little did I know I would get hooked on the delicious movie theater taste, with none of the fat issues of other brands!  There are a fair amount of unpopped kernels, but the volume and extraordinary flavor, allows the user to overlook that!

In fact, I've been known to go to movie theaters without buying a ticket just to buy some popcorn.<br /><br />We just finished our basement and my wife bought me a popcorn machine for Christmas. We tried a couple other "recipes" and couldn't find quite the taste we were looking for. I then saw the reviews for Great Northern and bought a box. The very first batch I popped got me hooked! It's a PERFECT recipe for my movie theater style taste. Whenever I have friends over and pop it for them, they too fall in love!<br /><br />Since my first order, I've set this up on repeat delivery so that I'm never out at home!

review/text: Popcorn has excellent flavor and nearly all kernels pop every time.  It is easy to make.  Just dump everything in the popper and fire it up.  I can see where some might say it's too salty, but if it is for you, just don't dump in all the salt!  It's definitely more expensive than bagged popcorn, but for the ease of making it and the flavor, it's probably worth it.

Plus, we did not hear a choir of angels singing the Halleluja Chorus when we ate it; it was mediocre popcorn with many unpopped kernels. My own fault - I should have known that, like sausage, its better not to know how "movie theater" popcorn is made (hint: yellow food dye is essential). We cannot bring ourselves to eat this again.

review/text: I popped my first batch and I have to say this does taste pretty darn close to what you'd find at a movie theatre.  Everything seems to be measured well enough that you don't see any grease stains when using a popcorn bag but you still get that distinct taste and flavor.  The popcorn tasted fresh but there are no expiration dates or lot numbers anywhere on the packaging so I'm not sure how they can trace anything if there's a bad batch. They don't have any ISO 9001 markings so I'm assuming there is no quality oversight of these.<br /><br />I have zero real complaints about the popcorn or the taste, but I don't think they should add some sort of traceability.

review/summary: Yummy popcorn, perfect for a whirley pop!
review/text: I purchased these 8 oz portion packs around a month ago, and at the time the 4 oz portion packs were out of stock. Now I am glad that they weren't in stock at the time, because it seems you get more bang for your buck with the 8 oz packs. They are only about 10 dollars more than the 4 oz packs, but you get twice as much product!<br />As far as taste, the oil and salt gives a spectacular taste to the popped corn. It isn't exactly that movie theater taste, but it is darn close. I mean lets be realistic, copying that theater taste is hard. But nevertheless, the taste is wonderful. I only use about 1/2-3/4 of the flavored salt because I think using all of it makes the popcorn too salty for me. The quality of the kernels is excellent. They pop quite big and aren't too chewy. If anyone has used cheap kernels (like great value), you know it can ruin popcorn.<br />I use the packs for my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SU35">Wabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a>, so I have to divide the contents in half. Half of the pack will fill up the popper easily, and I just keep the other half in a ziploc until I want to make more. I eat popcorn frequently, so it doesn't stay in the ziploc long, a few days at most. I'm not not sure how long they will last opened, but storing them safely should be fine.<br />Overall a great purchase! The starter portion pack that comes with a whirley pop (from Wabash Valley Farms) doesn't hold a candle to this stuff!

review/summary: Best popcorn I've ever had at home!
review/text: I purchased this popcorn for my Nostalgia retro popcorn machine hoping that I would be able to produce movie theatre quality popcorn at home.  The seller describes this as the best popcorn available and I have to agree that it really lives up to the hype!  The popcorn comes out delicious every time-- the perfect balance of butteriness and salt.  I tried using popcorn kernels and all kinds of different oils before I bought this product.  I will never use anything other than this popcorn!  The only problem is that I have eaten 10 of 24 packages-- and I've only had it for two weeks!

review/summary: Salty tip
review/text: The saltiness depends on how you prepare it.  When you pour the salt in with the oil and kernels and then pop the corn you can use the whole salt thing and it won't be salty at all.  If you only cook the kernels in the oil without the salt and then sprinkle the salt on to the popped corn last, it will be immensely salty. (I prefer the immensely salty style).  I really like this popcorn, I make it in a whirly-pop.  It always comes out perfect every time.  I like to add even more buttery-oil-goodness after popping (I like Kernel Seasons popcorn oil) to make it just like movie theater style.  This popcorn is a million times better than prepackaged microwave popcorn, the two are not even in the same league.

review/summary: Great Popcorn!
review/text: I bought the subscription to save money, hoping that the popcorn would be good.  I bought the 4 oz. to use with the Whirly Popper.  The first shipment of popcorn came extremely fast, within a day or two and I quickly popped up a batch to try it out.  It was delicious, light and fluffy and very good flavor.  Perfect.  I would highly recommend.  I'll probably buy a subscription for my popcorn loving sister-in-law.<br />I was very pleasantly surprised both with the fast shipment and the yummyness.  We will definately continue with the subscription.

review/text: I ordered this popcorn to use with the popcorn marker I got for Christmas. Very good popcorn, I wasn't sure about the coconut oil taste at first but it's a very mild coconut flavor that one can barely taste. I ordered the 2.5 oz size and it makes enough for 2 people to share. I'll order again!

review/summary: Great movie theater popcorn taste
review/text: I received a popcorn maker for Christmas. It has a small drum (holding 1/4 cup unpopped corn). I have never used a machine like this and wasn't sure if this popcorn size would be too much for the drum. It was perfect. The flavor is great, very similar to theater popcorn, although I am no popcorn connoisseur like others on this post. I just know what tastes good and this definitely does!

review/text: the packs are definitely not that easy to use, big and bulky, they could have cut it down A LOT and been just fine.<br /><br />the popcorn is GOOD, good quality. most of the kernels pop and are very tasty.  the oil is ok, not quite theater quality, but not bad, the salt, however, is a different story all together.  i does not taste good, NOT good at all.  if you use the whole portion it is FAR too salty, and definitely does not taste like theater popcorn, in fact the first batch i made i was so disappointed i thought i should have just kept buying microwaveable.<br /><br />however I've been playing and experimenting, as i don't ant to waste a whole $25.  i definitely like using all of the kernals and oil, and about 3/4th of the salt, it seems pretty good this way.<br /><br />i will buy a different brand next time, or just buy a whole box of salt directly from the theater and substitute that salt for this, however it is convenient and not too bad after you figure out the perfect recipe for you and your family.

review/summary: Actual theater popcorn -- this is it
review/text: I'm probably one of the most critical when it comes to replicating the movie theater experience at home.  You're looking at a guy whom has a motorized movie screen, projector, sound system, actual 4 head soda fountain and candy display.  So, matching the popcorn was a large task.  Initially I was stuck with buying popcorn and peanut oil.  Ya, it tasted good but no where near movie theater popcorn.  Then, I found Snappy Snappack's and Great Northern.  Greath Nothern was my first purchase.  I challenge you to read all the reviews on here.  I can assure you that those whom say the popcorn is too salty are correct.  The salt comes in a powder form mixed in with the seeds.  If you're careful you can separate the two with some effort.  Personally, I've gotten used to the salt but I can tell you that it is very salty.  The freshness wasn't a factor.  I have no doubt that others have gotten less than fresh popcorn.  Here's a warning:  when your package arrives, BE CAREFUL.  Don't just slice into it to open the box.  The people from amazon literally grab about 20 of the packets and drop them into a box.  I was at a city event where they were giving away free popcorn and snapped a picture of the popcorn they were using.  Snappy SnapPack: [...] This was not overly salted and tasted more like theater popcorn than great northern I think but they're both a toss up... it's super close.<br /><br />If you're unsure how big your kettle is... go by this: the 2.5oz is only good for one person.  The 2.5oz kettles are the ones you see like this:[...]<br /><br />You've seen them at places when you're out and about.  So in retrospect I should have gotten the 4.5oz one.  I have one of those small nostalgia popcorn cards.  2.5oz will fill up a large popcorn bucket about halfway.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this pre-packed popcorn is that it pretty much pops all the seeds.  When I used to pop popcorn from walmart popcorn and peanut oil it'd only pop about 50% of the seeds... the remaining seeds would fly out of the popper.<br /><br />There are some on here that talk about the buttery/oily mixture not looking fresh.  It does come as a semi-solid.  You don't need to kneed it, however.  Simply empty it into the kettle and it will melt on it's own.<br /><br />If you have any questions I'd love to answer them.  Just reply to this message.

After popping, there are very few unpopped kernels and it comes prepackaged with just the right amount of salt.  The oil gives it a unique taste.  If you have a 4oz popper, buy this popcorn.

review/summary: Amazing Cinema-quality Popcorn!
review/text: I'm kind of a popcorn fiend (I routinely walk into theaters just to buy popcorn and walk out without bothering to see a movie), but I hate-hate-HATE microwavable popcorn.  My wife bought me the Great Northern Little Bambino tabletop popcorn machine for Christmas, and I ordered the 24-pack of Great Northern popcorn packs because they were compatible with the machine and had consistently good reviews.<br /><br />We decided to take the popcorn machine for a test run during our NYE party, and the popcorn was, without a doubt, some of the best I've ever had.  It was just the right combination of salty, buttery and fresh, and it was a cinch to make.  Everyone at the party loved the stuff (we went through half the box), and I find myself craving some now as I write this review...<br /><br />In short, I enthusiastically and wholeheartedly recommend this popcorn.

If you want the same taste as the theatres, look no further.  Great Northern is the brand!!!!

A great buy for popcorn lovers. My only complaint is that the packaging is a little awkward in that you pretty much need to cut the popcorn, salt, and oil open and pour them into the popper separately to avoid spilling them all over the place-- but this style packaging seems to be very common from brand to brand.

review/summary: Quality product, packaging is a dud though.
review/text: I bought a case of 8 ounce packs of Great Northern Popcorn. The popcorn is great and the convenience of having pre-measured packs is very handy, it lowers the risks of contaminated product and guarantees freshness. However, something is wrong with the case I received. I just went through my remaining stock and threw away another 5 packs that were leaking oil. I then washed the oil mess off of what was left and tossed one more that wasn't sealed on the popcorn. This is after I tossed 7 away a month after buying the case. I had started organizing my pantry and noticed oil everywhere, the source being the corner of box of popcorn. Not a fun clean-up job. I had forgotten about it until today, when I had noticed oil all over again.<br /><br />The bottom edge of the packaging seems to weaken and develop points that "crack" open.<br /><br />So out of my case of 24, I've thrown away 12 and used 3, that's ridiculous in my opinion. It just might be cheaper to buy it elsewhere and avoid the waste.

review/text: You won't go wrong with this popcorn. It taste great and you have everything you need. If you like your popcorn a little on the salty side I would suggest also including some popcorn & nut salt. It's perfect on the popcorn and french fries. I'm on my second case of this popcorn and it's as good as my first case. A++

review/summary: Yellow flavorful yummy missing from your popcorn?  Order this!
review/text: When you go to the movie theater, the popcorn comes coated yellowish and golden.  You love the taste so much that you pick out the yellowist most flavorful kernels and eat them first. You've made popcorn at home, both on-the-stove and the microwave type, and it is missing "something".  This popcorn isn't missing anything.  From the tropical based oils to the carefully measured popcorn salt, this has it all.  It tastes exactly like the popcorn you get at the theater.  I've read a few complaints here that this popcorn is too salty.  I don't agree.  In fact when I make it, I add the full amount of oil and salt but withhold about 1/4 of the kernels to amplify the salty greasiness.  When I pop this corn the entire house fills up with that awesome "movie theater" popcorn smell but without that nasty microwave undertone.  The price was great, the product rocks, the shipping (even to Alaska!) was free, I can't really think of any constructive criticism for this product.  I don't  have a popcorn kettle, and the instructions on each package shows how to pop this rockstar either on the stove, with an air popper, in a kettle, etc.  So long as the free shipping applies, I will be ordering this product again and again and again.

review/summary: Neighborhood kids keep coming back for more
review/text: Our guests love this popcorn!  The premeasured portions make it so easy to use, and while it's not perfectly easy to add the ingredients, for us it's more about the location of the kettle in our theatre style machine than the packaging.<br /><br />Easy enough for my kids to make (teens, as I would worry about younger kids getting burnt on the kettle).<br /><br />For those who think it's too salty, that is easy enough to remedy, don't use all the salt!  Salty is a matter of taste, and some people might think the saltiness is just right with the amount they put in each package.  So, isn't the amount of salt they provide just right?  If they used less, there would be people complaining that there isn't enough salt.<br /><br />We think it's great!!

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I usually make my popcorn on the stove but when I got a popcorn machine I quickly noticed you can't use the same methods and decided to buy these packets.  The popcorn doesn't come out the same as when I make it on the stove but it is good nonetheless (a diff type of good) plus much less hassle.  I was worried when I read other reviews about the "stale" taste and oil...I didn't have any of that.  When the box came some of the oil was liquid and other packets were solid, it worried me but I found out that the oil had just hardened (it happens according to the temp of my house) which is quickly fixed when you pour the stuff into your hot popcorn maker.  No complaints here!

review/text: Bought for a popcorn machine at work, and it's wonderful. Tastes just like movie theater popcorn - it's legit and super simple. My only complaint is that there is a small space to pour ingredients into in my popcorn machine, and having a wide packet makes it difficult to pour the ingredients into. To the makers of this product, having a perforated edge or an easy open would be perfect so we don't have to keep a pair of scissors around our storefront.

review/text: I ordered this product for a 50th birthday party to be used with a full size carnival popcorn machine.  It was perfect for this use, however, we had several left over and was very surprised that we could use it in our regular sized Whirley Pop popcorn popper that we use at home.  We just needed to scale the amount back by 1/2 and do two batches, but it had the same great taste and popped wonderfully.  Will definitely order again just for home use.

review/summary: Awesome popcorn that's so easy
review/text: Ever since we bought our popcorn machine two years ago we've used this popcorn. Originally we had thought we'd get our own oil and save money rather than use the pre-portioned packs. However we tried it once and could never go back. It's just so easy and delicious that it's worth any extra expense. We went on the auto-ship program to save some money. I highly recommend this popcorn. It's actually ruined us on movie theater popcorn since we actually prefer this.

review/text: These packs have the perfect recipe of oil, corn, and seasoning. I've been trying to get a corn recipe that duplicates the flavor of a big amusement-park popper. Put this corn in a souvenir bucket from one of our big amusement parks in Orlando and you can't tell the difference. Everybody that's tasted it is very impressed.<br /><br />I have a whirly-pop popper, the larger size that should use the 5.5oz packs that come with the popper. While these 6oz packs work fine in the popper, the corn nearly bursts from the popper. Next time I'll get the 4oz packs.<br /><br />Perfect texture, fluffiness, color, and flavor. I love it!

review/text: I serve this popcorn to my guests and they can't get over how much taste it has. Not to much salt nor not to much oil. It tastes so fresh. It is always served as part of our appetizers when entertaining. We even have people that use the pool adjacent to our home yell at me to 'bring popcorn'. The free shipping is very nice. The discount for setting up automatic shipments is a nice perk. We have purchase at least 4 cases since we bought the Roosevelt popcorn maker and the cart. It is a nice addition to our family room.

review/summary: Excellent, but...
review/text: Just got a popper and bought some of this as well as some West Bend popcorn (which I tried with the Lou-Ana popcorn oil bars). I very much prefer these. More of the kernels popped, they were far fluffier, and the popcorn simply tasted better (this is after salting the West Bend with Paragon Butter Flavored Seasoning Salt). The packs make it very simple. Cut the top, dump in the kettle, hit the heater, wait for the sound of the sizzle, and go! My only concern is that you have to take a bit of care not to drop oil all over the place. If you cut the top off, then carefully 'roll' the pack, it makes it much easier to drop it all in, then squeeze the oil out.

review/summary: Not bad for what you pay
review/text: I like to first state that I used this product in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RC6R">West Bend 82306X Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper</a>, not a traditional kettle popcorn maker like you see at the theater.  The other reviews all state that the popcorn once popped is really salty. I did not have this experience and quite on the contrary found it to be not salty at all.  This might be due to the difference in popping machines.  In the stir crazy when I poured the popcorn/salt side into the machine the salt all fell into a pile.  The stirring arm on the machine probably wasn't able to move the salt around like in a kettle type machine.  I also feel that the package does not include enough of the oil to make the popcorn really flavorful.  There was plenty to pop and flavor it but I think I just prefer more oil in my popcorn.  Lastly, the kernels while tasting pretty good did not pop as big as Orville Reddenbacher.  They weren't as fluffy and were more dense as well.  On the plus size they did not have a lot of husks to get stuck in your teeth like the "Gold Medal" brand I've tried recently.  Overall a pretty good product to use in the Stir Crazy.  When I get a kettle type machine in the near future I will definitely be trying these packs again to see if there is a difference in the taste based on the type of machine.

review/summary: Perfect Popcorn and Allows Adjustable Salt Content
review/text: These packs guarantee that each batch you pop is fresh (obviosuly much fresher than even theater popcorn), and of course it tastes great!  This is a perfect pack for 8oz poppers, everything is pre-measured.  My wife really likes that fact that the the corn, oil and salt are all partitioned separately on these packs.  That way we can control exactly how much salt goes into the batch for popping.  Reducing the amount of salt by half still gives us great tasting popcorn.  I can vary the amount of salt in each batch based upon the preference of the people that will be eating the popcorn.  Everyone is happy this way.  Try doing that at a theater concession stand!
