review/summary: California rice bran oil
review/text: I a saw this reviewed on Dr. Oz's program where he pointed the health benefits for using this oil.  I tried it and was exceedingly pleased with it.  When you use it for frying it does not have an oily taste and is not drenched with oil like other oils.  Has a neutral taste. I recommend everybody to try it and make their own judgement. I am sure that they will not be disappointed.

review/text: This is one of the only oils you can use to fry just about anything and not have your entire house smell like a greasy dinor. I use it to make homemade popcorn also, a big hit with the kids. It has a mild, non-heavy feel to it when used for cooking. I originally bought it at a fruit drink stand at my gym. It is a great substitue for veg, or other oils.

review/text: Im not a big fan of soda, too many calories, plus I never drink something with calories that doesn't come with a pleasing side affect(caffine/alcohol) which leaves me with nothing to drink between my morning coffee and evening wine.<br /><br />Now I have something that tastes good(I can't stand the taste of artificial sweeteners), and has caffine. I had already totally embraced the canned refreshers I'd found in the grocery store, so I was ready to give the powdered version of this wonderful drink a try.  I brought this drink with me while traveling, and emptied it into my water bottle and was rewarded by a very refreshing drink(hence the name).<br /><br />I will be buying these in quantity in the future.

review/text: In the land of cubed bouillon, there are 3 remaining contenders for the<br />"Best Of" title. There's Maggi, Goya (which is not a Jewish company OK)<br />and Knorr. They are all similar, and all in different cost categories,<br />but this is the most easily found cube bouillon locally.<br /><br />These 3 brand names are all great, but this is the one I've used for years<br />and years. It effectively replaced Wyler's about 10 years ago when Wyler's<br />decided to start making chicken bouillon that tastes like burnt plastic.<br /><br />This stuff is great for making rice, grits, and for explosive flavors in<br />soups and sauces. The flavor is so rich that it actually makes a good stand<br />in for chicken stock. I use 5 of these in a pot of Soup Nazi's Chicken Chili,<br />and only use stocks for very special dishes. Its that good!<br /><br />Nestle is the parent company, and they have a million products but this great<br />foundational product hasn't been corporatized yet, lets keep it that way OK!

review/text: With age, my tummy has decided it doesn't like me very much, and this product gives me a nutritious breakfast, that fills me up and is easy on my stomach.<br /><br />I enjoy this best when I soak 2 Tablespoons of the seeds in a cup of water or milk overnight.  It forms into a gel by the next morning.  If I've soaked it in milk, I add a tablespoon or so of Nestle's Chocolate Quick, and it tastes a little like chocolate tapioca pudding.  If I've mixed it with water, I add a bit of Tang the next morning, and it tastes like a fruity-flavored slush.  Sometimes, I also add shelled hemp seeds and/or cocoa nibs for a little more nutrition and flavor.  When I add these extras, I also run it through the blender so I won't have to "chew" my shake.<br /><br />I also like that this has lots of fiber.  It doesn't have much taste on it's own, so it takes on the flavor of whatever I'm mixing it with.

review/text: This product functions as a great supplement to a healthy diet.  There is one catch - finding the appropriate meals to make it a part of.  When added to a cereal mix with milk, it becomes slimy.  When added to oatmeal, product is very noticeable.  Look around for suggestions on how to consume.  The product does have a taste, is noticeable, and does get stuck in your teeth when consumed.  Again, no different than any other potential food additives such as flax seed, but this product is just small enough and hard enough that it is very noticeable when added to any of your foods.

When you are dieting and just want 'something', a cup of this is infinitely better than that handful of chips, and stirs up in seconds.<br /><br />Recommended highly!

review/summary: NEVER AGAIN.
review/text: I purchased this product for my brother's birthday. as was forever saying that he thought chocolate-covered bacon sounds so delicious.  I knew the Vosges Milk Chocolate Bacon Bar would be in bar form, as it says on the website, but what I didn't know, is that the bar contained very, very tiny pieces (they turned out to be GRAINS of bacon, sparsely distributed).  After my brother open the gift, revealing the "chocolate bacon bar" everybody at the party started laughing.  Telling me that I "was scammed".  I was utterly humiliated.<br /><br />Look at the photo of the piece of bacon on the box.  That, to me, infers that there is a piece of bacon inside, that is covered in chocolate.  Quite frankly, I would not complain if there were at least BACON CHUNKS inside the bar of chocolate.  Not so.<br /><br />I am now on the hunt for a recipe to make chocolate covered bacon at home.  I'm not much in kitchen, so this is a real chore for me.  And it's highly unlikely I'll be able to make it myself.  Like I said, I'm not much of a cook.<br /><br />BOOOOOOOOOO!

I saw this flavor and decided to try it . . . it's delicious . . . rich and flavorful with no acidic undertones . . . even better with vanilla flavored creamer.  I'll buy it again.

review/summary: Very hard product
review/text: I looked these Halo pumpkin dental chews up on Amazon to see reviews.  I also read the ingredients on them, and found they were wholesome good food products that I would want my dogs eating.<br />  I went by my local animal food store and bought two of these chews for the 25-60Lb size.  One was for my 20lb jack russell who is an avid chewer and the other was for my 40lb aussie/heeler.  Great ingredients.  Since this size has 85 calories a piece, I needed to give only half to the jack.  I gave the jack the half one and the aussie the full one.  Wow, were they hard.  Problem was my jack wanted the whole thing in his mouth while he tried to chew pieces off which he couldn't really.  So I thought uhoh I better get the rest away from him but if he thinks I am coming to take it he will gulp it.  So I distracted him with squirt cheese and took half of the half away.  The aussie promptly gulped the rest of hers fearing I was going after hers too.  So where these were great that they were hard so they actually had to chew on them, maybe not for gulpers.  The dogs seemed very happy with the taste and smell.

review/summary: A New Favorite
review/text: I am impressed by Halo's products, although the canned food variety is the only thing I had previously tried, when I was babying my dog while she was recuperating after her spay surgery. I can feel good about feeding her such wholesome food, and she devours it. This was my first time buying Halo treats. Even though the package says they're for dogs 25-60 lbs, my 17 lb, one year old terrier mix is still in the puppy stage and is an avid chewer. I was looking for a product to change it up from the old reliable rawhide, for something she would not demolish in 5 minutes, and something different than meat-flavored treats (for variety). I was unsure if she would go for the pumpkin flavor, but this was an instant hit! She LOVES the taste of these treats and has no problem chewing them. I gave her a whole stick and she worked on it (kept her occupied) for about 45 minutes until it was completely gone. They smell really good, like pumpkin pie spice, and although they are dark brown in color, they do not stain like some of the red-colored rawhide products I've tried. I have gone through half the bag so far (7 sticks in a bag), giving her one every few days, and she really enjoys them. I am definitely buying these again, and I am going to try the mint variety and see if that's a winner too. I'd recommend that even if you have a small dog, give them a try to switch up your choice of hard chew treats if your puppy or dog is a big chewer.

review/text: These have great ingredients and smell so good, I wanted to eat it lol. However they are really hard so if your dog isn't a big chewer, like mine, it's not such a good idea. Brownie stopped trying after 30 minutes. So these are going to be donated to the animal shelter. These are for medium to large dogs, not so much for small dogs unless they're really aggressive chewers.

review/summary: Our dog loves these minty chews
review/text: We've tried other Halo products previously and have been happy so we thought we'd give this one a try.<br /><br />We first bought these at our local pet supply store when we ran out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KSQXKO">Paragon toothbrush chews</a> one day.  It turns out that our 15lb pom mix loves Spot's Chews and they smell great to us as well.  The only issue is that it's a lot of chew for a small dog, although they are labeled as being for "small/medium" pets.  They are hard to break so my husband was slicing them into thirds with a knife and we'd give a third of a chew a day.<br /><br />One cute thing is that if you look at them top down, they are actually shaped like hearts.

review/summary: My favorite tea--I keep coming back to it
review/text: I take strong exception to another reviewer who was disappointed in the taste of this jasmine white tea.  I am a long-time tea drinker, and one by one, my "most favorite" teas have fallen by the wayside. The one tea that I can drink day after day and never get tired of it, is this one.  Sure, I still drink others just for variety, but this is the one that I always come back to.<br /><br />I used to buy it at World Market, just like the other reviewer, but my local WM stopped carrying the white teas.  I asked an employee there if they would ever have any back in stock, and she said, "Oh the jasmine tea?  That's SO GOOD!"  But--no, they are no longer carrying it.<br /><br />The jasmine flavor is not strong, and complements the delicate white tea flavor very well.  Like the other reviewer, I use filtered water, but I certainly do not make my own tea bags!  Good grief....  And where the reviewer came up with the unwelcome orange smell is beyond me.<br /><br />I wish Republic of Teas would make a sampler pack of their white teas--then people could try them without shelling out a lot of money.

review/summary: Does not taste like White tea
review/text: This tea did not taste like I expected it to.  For a long time I have been using the loose leaf White tea with Jasmine from EnjoyingTeas.com and have been really happy with it.  But I wanted the portability that tea bags offer and EnjoyingTeas did not have any product to offer. So I purchased "REPUBLIC OF TEA Asian Jasmine White Tea" at Cost Plus World market for about $14.<br /><br />When I opened the canister, it did not smell like jasmine, but more of a rancid candy smell.  Jasmine usually has a sweet floral scent and taste, and marries well with green and white teas.  This tea did not smell or taste like that,  It almost smelled like it was mixed up with the Orange flavored white tea that they offer.  I used Sparkletts bottled water since I am not a fan of the tap water taste in tea, and even with the better water, there was no light tea taste like there usually is with white tea.  The tea did turn a golden yellow like it should have, and but had a tang taste that did not taste like jasmine.  With tap water one could only imagine that the taste would be much worse, at least where I live.  I have read elsewhere that the tea used in tea bags is usually lower grade, and usually tastes that way. I will resort to buying a box of tea filters/bags and make my own tea bags with the loose leaf tea that I already have.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you are familair with the taste of white teas, these tea bags will only be a dissappointment.  Try the loose leaf White tea with jasmine instead.

Lavazza pods have nice creme. The water flows faster compared to the Illy pods so need to run the expresso machine for a little less time. The Illy pods are probably a little better quality - but at twice the price are not worth the additional investment. I would strongly recommend these. And the shipper was on time and the goods packed well. They do come loose so you will need a container to store them (unlike the illy pods that are boxed)

review/text: For wonderful quality and exceptional taste, nothing beats these LaVazza ESE pods!  I make lattes with these every morning, the coffee flavor is so smooth, much nicer than the bitter tasting Starbucks ESE pods I used before.

review/summary: Loosely packed ese pod produces inconsistent results
review/text: I own an Illy x6 and it came with a sampler of illy ese pods. When those ran out I researched online and ordered these pods. First of all the pod is not tightly packed and has a looseness which makes the fit in the holder improper. As a result sometimes the illy machine keeps on going and overflows the normal quantity which an espresso cup would hold.<br /><br />Secondly the flavor body and aroma are diffuse and not good for espresso. If you are making a cappuccino you will likely not taste much difference. I do not recommend Lavazza for espresso on an illy machine.

review/summary: Tried a variety of pods, and these have been the best
review/text: We tried a variety of pods in our Francis Francis X5 and these were by far the best.  Been ordering this stuff for years now.  The taste is very smooth and not bitter.  This stuff spoils us because the espresso at the coffeeshops around here are never as good.<br /><br />Of course, crema-wise you'll still do better with whole beans and a high quality grinder.  We get a thin crema top with these but that's about it.  As I think everyone understands there's a tradeoff to be made with pods--and no other pod I've tried has ever been any better for me in this respect--I haven't held that against this product.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: ESE pods make great espresso in our Krups pump espresso maker. Smoother, more flavorful espresso than the Espressione Classic Espresso Coffee Pods. The Lavazza Gran Crema Pods seem a little smaller than others, so we use the smallest filter holder. Also recommended: PodMerchant Espresso Pod Super Sampler.

review/summary: easiest way to make great coffee from a pod
review/text: I have been using Lavazza for the past 20 years since discovering it in Italy. I am glad to see it become more available in the past few years. For the true barista go for the ground lavazza bar but for the easy no fuss no mess espresso or capuccino/latte the Lavazza pod is consitently the best that I have tried. I use both products and have been very satisfied. Works great in my krups with the pod filter basket. I highly reccommend it.

review/summary: Loosey goosey.
review/text: Easy serve espresso pods, or ESE pods are supposed to be a consistent size, weight and tamp.  But as a machine manufacturer I can tell you first hand that the coffee brewers intentionally modify the ESE spec to make their pods more likely to work well in their machine. ( and not so well in a competitor's)  You see, in Italy, the coffee biz is like the cell biz here.  Buy a contract for two years of monthly pods and we will throw a machine in for free.  They don't want you using that machine with OPP (other people's pods).  So they take a perfectly good standard and tweak it so it is no longer a standard.  In the case of these pods, they are way too loosely packed to work in any of my pod only machines.  Water flows so fast it barely changes colors.  Oh well, I've only got 149 left.  Ughhh.

review/summary: No value
review/text: Lavazza coffee is great - no problem with that, but these pods are an absolute waste of $. I thought the pods would offer some convenience when in a rush to make espresso in the morning when heading out to work. Wrong move. They work poorly - I tried them in three different high quality machines, all with the same results. Poor, uneven flow with not enough substance to give a smooth shot with good creme. Frustrated, I decided to just open up the pods and put the good stuff in a can for proper use... that's when I discovered just how big a rip-off these are. Buying Lavazza in the can is about $7.00 for an 8.8 oz. can on average - I bought 150 pods for about $55 and when I emptied out about half of these into a can I got just that - 1 can. $27.50 per can. Hmmm... that means I just paid $20+ for their packaging. Stupid me. Convenience be damned, I'll just buy canned coffee and work for my cup in the morning.

We have a Rancilio espresso machine, and the results have been consistent.  The pod produce a nice crema and the same taste everytime.<br /><br />The pods come loose in a big cardboard box, so it's not as fancy as some of the other brands (e.g. the nicely packaged Illy or Starbucks), but they are much cheaper, so it's worth it for me.

review/summary: Near Best but so many are So Good
review/text: There is good and bad aspects.  Most conspicuous is that too much water comes through in twenty seconds.  Double fills more than half a regular coffee cup with 22 sec. brews.  Too watery?<br /><br />Rules are relative in my world.  I could brew shorter times for 2oz doubles but I don't.  This tastes so good even with the extra water.  Tiny bit of sugar and none I like better.<br /><br />Always trying lots of different expressos although I avoid any @ $10/lb and above.  Costco had a Sulawesi Estate 2.5lb for $12 (close?) close second to Lavazza.  Beans not pods so less convenient.  Went through 7.5lbs Selawesi then gone.  Waiting for return?<br /><br />Been brewing espresso for twenty plus years and pretty fast at it so grinding with my Rocky is easy.  So, its a little watery so what?  It tastes good, really good.  Been around a long time and huge following.  Guess their bean mix is big secret.  It is soft, smooth, mild, low acid, IMHO  Lucaffe Classic 150 pods also good.  Stronger more acid and heck the red package is pretty.<br /><br />Lots of local and National brands and flavors.  Some seem to get into the "get what you pay for" or "if it cost more it is better" hoping it appeals to baser instincts.  If you can pay $10lb and do it again and again with no thought to cost let's drink yours, LOL<br /><br />Flavor for cost and convenience puts this POD Lavazza Gran Crema high on my list of favorites.  Since you can brew PODS why not try that variety pack and see what you like?  Almost all of them are excellent and some are acceptable none were bad that I can remember.  Several from that sampler can be bought like this Lavazza offer.<br /><br />I have consumed two or three of these 150 Lavazza boxes.  Mixing with beans and other pods each 150 box lasted about a year.  When I am tired, it's late, and I think of it, I reach for a couple Lavazza PODS for quick and easy espresso.<br /><br />Price on this varies.  First paid about $41 and now $51.  Sorry just noticed price went up in last week to $55.  Seen it for $60+ for 150 PODS.  They are sealed so no hurry to consume.  Only fresh beans make crema like pods.  One week and flavor begins to taper with slightly finer grinds required to maintain 22sec brews with most coffee beans.<br /><br />Never tried to figure the cost per pound equivalent with PODS.  Maybe I don't want to know, LOL

review/summary: A fine bargain -  however, ESE pod is good but not great
review/text: I bought these pods to use when traveling with my Handpresso machine.<br /><br />At most stores, 18 ESE pods cost $15 (83� each). I jumped at the chance to buy these Lavazza pods for 30� each. However, not all pods are created equal. I've always enjoyed Lavazza brand coffee, so I knew the taste would be good. But these pods are not packed as tightly as others - the grounds in Ily Caf&eacute; pods, for example, are packed much more tightly which allows more resistance to maintain the steam pressure required to make a great cup of espresso.<br /><br />With the Handpresso, and I found that if I overfill the water basket so that the pod is infused with a little water before I close up the nozzle - the grounds expand and offer a little more resistance when making the shot. Compared to they Ily pods, the Lavazza wasn't quite as good, but the espresso they deliver is still pretty tasty. Considering the price, this is still a very good deal. But if you're snooty about your coffee, you may prefer other brands of pods.<br /><br />Many vendors offer big sampler packs so you can try many different brands of ESE pods - if you've never used pods before - and you're particular about your java, I recommend trying a sampler pack before you commit to a large quantity like this.

review/summary: Not fresh tasting. Bitter.
review/text: I expected better from Lavazza having been introduced to it in Rome last year. In perspective, I usually grind my espresso beans (Brazil Sweet Blue is my favorite) immediately before brewing and I always buy beans that have been roasted no more than 1 week ago. This obviously skew my taste toward fresh product and these pods are definitely not that. Convenient, though.

review/text: I like these and both of the Espressione (classic & 100% arabica) E.S.E. pods. Have had some bad luck with other pods (Baronet in particular). These are very consistent in the espresso that they make and have excellent crema. And they're the least expensive that I could find on amazon or locally, so I'd recommend them pretty well. Grinding my own coffee (and having roasted it as well), I sometimes make a better espresso than the pods. But not everytime if I don't get the grounds tamped just right. 150 pods should last you a week. At least!

review/text: We have been using the Gran Crema espresso pods in our Starbucks 'Barista' machine, which comes with the ESE pod adapter. We had alot of problems with weak, or bitter, and outdated Starbuck's pods and found the Lavazza Pods here on Amazon. We switched and haven't looked back. The Lavazza pod is consistently very rich and creamy with great flavor (and aroma). They have an excellent shelf life (it takes us about 3 mos to go though 150). My only fear is that I will run out and have to buy more of the Starbuck's brand to hold us over - or (shudder) go back to the mess and inconvienience of grinding beans.

review/summary: Lavazza Gran Crema Espresso Pods
review/text: I had a chance to test these ese pods when I received two of them with my new Handpresso wild. I used one with the Handpresso and one with my Hamilton Beach espresso maker. Both tasted heavenly, smooth with no bitterness. I got more Crema with the Handpresso but the Hamilton Beach made it warmer. Well I can now save some money as I used to use My Francis X8 with Illy capsules. Each Illy capsule costs 75 cents a piece even if you buy 4 cans ( 21 capsule in each ) at a time while the Lavazza pod costs 33-35 cents if you buy 150 pods at a time. You get more Crema with Illy but the taste is similar or a little below the Lavazza. Now my next step is to get some Illy fine ground coffee with a good tamper and use it with my Hamilton Beach, it will cost much less than the capsules. By the way, I am not trying to be cheap. I spent a lot of money on expensive espresso machine above $1000 and got convinced not to waste  more money anymore. They may make slightly? better espresso but with repair and maintenance they cost you more than daily visits to Starbucks or other Coffee shops. I believe this is the most economical way to enjoy a decent cup of espresso or cappuccino. If you want to make the ultimate cup of espresso get yourself a manual Quickmill Anita or a Pavoni with expensive grinder and practice different grinds and become an artist. True it needs a lot of work but is better and cheaper than going for the super automatic junk machines they sell nowadays with $1000-3000 each. By the way those expensive one button machines do not make better espresso than the non automatic ones. Please believe me. It comes from experience.

review/text: I love flavoured tea and it's not too often when you find a variety pack with all your favourite flavours.  I was pretty excited about this - almost too good to be true.  Well, there's no miracles, folks. The first package was all green teas, all 5 packs.  Happens - no big deal - I asked to resend my order. The second time 3 out of 8 flavours were different and individual pack weight was 25% less than advertised, 120g instead of 160g.  Not nice!<br />Make up your own mind if you find this OK or not. I, personally, find it unacceptable. I got my order refunded and would not recommend anybody to buy from this company.<br />As for the quality of the product - it's a little hard to be objective after this but as far as I can tell the tea is nothing special, flavours taste artificial and are not very pronounced. The bags are wrapped in paper and are not air-tight as foil wrap so buying in large quantities is not a good idea if you like your tea fresh.<br />Thanks for reading and also have a look at the picture I uploaded to illustrate my points.

I am kind of regretting that this came in a package of 5 boxes, when 1 would have been enough for my purposes.  Won't order again, anyway.

review/text: Very, very good tea!!! You will have 400 bags for this little price.<br />I tried one in a metal bin (Bentley's Finest Tea Classic Collection, 120-Count Tea Bag in Assorted Tins (Pack of 2  and it was the worse tea.
