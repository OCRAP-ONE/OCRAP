review/summary: tea time
review/text: I had tried many decaf green teas for years, and when my favorite was no longer available, I tried Bigelow, and it is a perfect replacement for me.  It has a very smooth flavor with a stronger kick that I prefer, by keeping the teabag in for a while.  Others were very week tasting, even with using two bags per brew.  I found something that will be helpful to others, I use Evian bottled water when I make this tea, and it made a big difference in the flavor.  My filtered tap water made it less tasty with a harsher flavor, so try your favorite bottled water if you're not happy with the taste.<br />Love getting the bulk buy, a very good deal, and I only have to walk to my pantry to get another box!!

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: I've been waiting for ages for this product to show up on Amazon so that I can review it.  I've been enjoying Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero salsa for quite a while, enjoying its fantastic heat/sweet ratio, and just wishing it was chunkier and a bit hotter.  Then along comes this stuff.  They must have been listening!<br /><br />I'm pretty sure this is the hottest salsa Mrs. Renfro's offers, and I think it's the perfect level for those of us who really enjoy some heat with our salsa but don't have a hot foods shoppe nearby.  I'll take this opportunity to kvetch that I have seen some reviews out there--video reviews--of people opening a jar of this stuff, dipping the corner of a chip in it, eating the whole chip, and going, 'Oh, it's not that hot.'<br /><br />Yeah, duh.  It's not hot sauce, people.  It's SALSA.  It's meant to be enjoyed in moderate SCOOPS, not in tiny little dollops like Blair's Sudden Death (excellent, btw).  SCOOP the stuff onto a chip the way you're meant to, and have yourself about five chips in this manner.  Now stop.  ...  Yeah, I *thought* you'd be reaching for the tissues.  Welcome to chips and salsa.  That's how you eat them.<br /><br />Onward: This salsa has a great texture--it could be chunkier, it's true (all the Mrs. Renfro's salsas have this issue), but it's chunkier than many of their others, and it's still thick enough to stick to the chip.<br /><br />The flavour is almost a head-scratcher.  When you get that first bite, right before the heat smacks you across the face, there's this moment of, 'Ooh.  Hey.  What's that?'  Some have called it curry-like, others chili-like (not as in pepper, but as in a pot of chili).  I realize this makes me a bad reviewer, but I'm honestly not sure *what* it is.  I think it's part garlic, part roasted tomatoes, and part... part... oh, I don't know.  Liquid deliciousness?  Yeah, that sounds right.<br /><br />Upon first bite, this salsa became my current favourite.  (I'd spell out the happy moan I let loose when I first tried it, but this is a family site.)  In the course of a month, I have finished four jars of it.  That is not an exaggeration.  I have been driven to unexpectedly have chips and salsa for dinner more times than a person should (should they ever?) for the love of this salsa.<br /><br />My local grocery put it on sale.  Oh, bad move, people.  I cleared them out.  Thank the chili gods that they restocked.<br /><br />I have tried a lot of salsa in my life.  Most of the really good spicy stuff is only available in chilihead specialty shoppes or online with massive shipping charges (but hey, the stuff is heavy).  To my knowledge, this is the hottest salsa (I repeat: NOT HOT SAUCE) that you can find in a regular grocery store.<br /><br />I've already recommended it to all my friends who enjoy hot foods or have people in their family who do so.  Now I recommend it to you.  Enjoy it!  I know I do.

review/summary: Wow
review/text: Brutal stuff, but still edible.  The salsa itself is a bit tangy, average taste for a salsa, but you won't care about that after a couple of minutes anyway, because your face will be melting off.  Just kidding.  This is a great option for anybody who wants to partake of the bhut jolokia, but without the fear of the hotter concentrated sauces (or the evil evil evil "extracts").  The pain is only temporary, hold milk or an ice cube in your mouth if you overdo it (water will not cool chile burn).

review/summary: HEAT!!!
review/text: I have enjoyed Mrs. Renfro's Habanero Salsa. Last time I went shopping, I noticed that the salsa section in the store included this--the ghost pepper in a salsa.<br /><br />If you don't like heat, don't try this. If you like heat, be judicious in how much salsa you put, for example, on a tortilla chip. I just had about 6-7 chips a half an hour ago. I was spare in how much salsa I put on each chip. WOW! The burn was pretty good, and the taste of the salsa, despite the heat, was fine. For most of the past half hour, I have had a lingering burn in my mouth.<br /><br />So, if one is interested in a hot salsa, this is terrific. But be careful in how much you use. Too much and this would be inedible for most of us. The right amount? You have a spicy (yet still tasty) condiment.

review/summary: Some of the tastiest salsa around!
review/text: I buy this salsa quite frequently at my local grocery store. It goes GREAT by itself and with dishes (whether it be tacos, enchiladas or migas). It goes without saying, but use caution when eating this, especially if it's your first time eating the infamous ghost pepper (it was my first time, and boy what a wake up call it was!). If it's too hot for you, you can always mix it up with another, milder salsa.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is delicious, even though the spiciness dominates everything else. Try it out!<br /><br />If you enjoy this stuff, BTW, I would also recommend checking out Silverleaf's "Ghost Pepper Salsa" and "Ghost Pepper Salsa Verde". Unfortunately it's not available on Amazon's website (which hopefully they'll make it available soon), you'll have to search for their website to get it.<br /><br />Have fun!

review/summary: Good instant mashed potatoes but cheese flavor dissapointing.
review/text: I so wanted to love these "chreesy"  mashed potatoes but the cheese flavor was not cheesy at all.  They weren't bad but Edward & Sons need to find a better source than Roads End for their "cheese" flavoring.  I much prefer the cheese sauce from Namaste Foods.  Also I do not like that the "cheese" flavor has so much yeast, as I limit my yeast intake.<br /><br />I am not giving up on Edward & Sons though, I am trying their roasted garlic flavor potatoes because I was happy with the potatoes, just not the cheese flavoring.  Very quick and easy to prepare too!  The price is not outrageous for a vegan/special diet product. If you happen to like Road's End "cheese" sauce then you will like these.<br /><br />You need to add more liquid than the directions call for though or these turn out gummy and dense.  Increase water to 1 & 1/2 cups and increase "milk" to 3/4 cup or even a little more.  I add Earth Balance margarine too and they turn out so much better.<br /><br />Update 6/23/10:  I've now tried both the Roasted Garlic and Homestyle varieties and I love both.  Just make the above changes to prep directions and they are perfect.  So the problem was the Road's End "Chreese" sauce they used for these.

review/summary: Great for backpacking!
review/text: People's tastes vary for sure, and I'm not really big on cheese substitutes, but I found these to be really good! A fellow vegan recommended them, which prompted me to try them, and I wasn't disappointed. I make them at home sometimes or take them for lunch, but I especially like to take them out backpacking. They rehydrate instantly. Heat up extra water and then whip them up to the consistency that you prefer. Instant mashed potatoes always take more water than you think they should. I add extra salt to the preparation, and I might add Earth Balance at home but not in the backcountry These turn out good every time and are a nice variation from regular instant potatoes, especially on backpacking trips. I have been delighted to find them on Amazon because I cannot find them locally.

review/summary: A solid deal for a good-tasting cereal that won't inspire eater's remorse
review/text: Honey Bunches of Oats is not the sort of cereal that a fitness enthusiast will eagerly endorse. The fiber tally is a bit low at 1.4 grams and the sugar total is a bit high at 6.5. There are certainly much worse offenders, but whole-grain and 'no sugar' alternatives are inarguably better for your waistline.<br /><br />On the other hand, they tend to taste much like you'd expect. Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds is a nice mix of crunchy textures and pleasant flavors. With a bit of banana or some fresh berries, you'll actually enjoy this bowl of breakfast. If you are really watching what you eat, you'll want to focus your attention elsewhere, perhaps staring fixedly at the superior nutritional content of your oat flakes as you munch away with steely determination. If not, and if you actually prefer to enjoy your meals, Honey Bunches of Oats (HBoO for short) is a fine choice. This particular variety boasts almonds, which normally would be enough to possibly perk up the calorie counters, but not in great enough volume to push the health food needle. They merely add a pleasant complement to the palate.<br /><br />My 4-pack arrived relatively intact, with just enough crumpling on the base of one of the boxes to merit that bit of equivocation. Shucking the plastic sheath to liberate the cereal itself was easily done without any further damage done along the way.

review/text: we decided to check on Amazon for this cereal as we realized there was too much variability in its prices in the grocery stores- as a result, we were hoarding too many boxes when the deals were on. We got a great deal on Amazon grocery, competitive with buying in a store on a deal, and the free shipping was a bonus with the subscription! The boxes arrived on time and in good condition- the cereal was, contrary to our expectations, not powdered.<br /><br />Do remember before you sign up for subscriptions that upon subscibing, all your orders will have 15% off, but the price of the item itself is subject to change. Also, the 2-day free shiping is only on the first order- it is free ground shipping on the subsequent ones.<br /><br />That said, happy munching!

review/text: It was a Friday; much like Kid Cudi, I can no longer distinguish between day and night.  Me and my boys hit our local grocery store, but they were all out of Honey Bunches of Oats.  I was like, "What kind of cruel joke is this?  I demand to speak to your manager," but the manager just said, "No speak English.  Out of cereal today."  I was devastated, until my boy Fred - he's the straight-A wizkid in our crew who gets so relaxed that he can headshot noobs on CoD while sipping earl grey tea and staying classy - suggested that we order from Amazon.  I was like, "Fred!  This is why you're the straight-A wizkid in our crew who gets so relaxed that he can headshoot noobs on CoD while sipping earl grey tea and staying classy!"  He was like, "Holla, brotha," while doing some calculus in his head and sipping some Aquafina.  Because of the commercials, Aquafina always reminds me of the number, "I Feel Pretty" from "West Side Story."  Although "West Side Story" is a classic, I prefer "Wicked" on Broadway because it reminds me of my own adventures in the Emerald City, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />But I digress.  The order took awhile, but our appetites had not subsided.  After admiring the fantastic, emotionally overwhelming art on all six sides of the box for a couple of hours (we all hugged and cried because we could really feel the artist's passion), we attacked all four packs of cereal simultaneously.  The four-pack combines convenience and quality - two product characteristics that are rarely seen today.  When we finished, we cut up the box and framed each side in sleek, contemporary, thin maroon frames that really made the colors on the box snap, crackle, and pop.<br /><br />Honey Bunches of Oats are great.  Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds are fantastic.  Four packs of Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds are divine.

review/summary: Honey Bunches of Oats is the best!
review/text: Yesterday I was in the supermarket and couldn't decide between corn flakes, frosted flakes, a cereal with almonds or one with crunchy clusters...so I just stood there...standing (yes, I stood there, standing)...irresolute...vacillating with uncertainty. Partly because I had no idea how I got in the store (it was because I took an Ambien), but for the most part because I was having a hell of a time deciding which cereal to buy. I would reach out to grab a box and then stop halfway. A box would find its way into my cart and I would immediately put it back. At one point I even had four different types of cereal in my cart. "No way I'm buying all these different cereals. There's just no way." While I'm saying this to myself, the stockboy is staring at me. "Why did I ever decide to come in here with a robe on and slippers today?" I thought to myself. My attire had undermined any wisp of non-creepiness I had when I entered the store. Time was not on my side, a choice had to be made. A crowd was starting to form. People were taking bets on what choice I was going to make. Okay, maybe that didn't really happen; I mistook the crowd for a mom with a bunch of kids that I saw from the corner of my eye. Nonetheless, I had to get home. I was hungry. I decided to just close my eyes and grab a box. After spinning around several times, I stuck my arm out and grabbed what felt like a big bag of marshmallows; it was an elderly woman's buttocks. She had apparently bent over in front of me to pick up a penny. I quickly tried to explain it was an honest mistake, however, she struck me with her purse before I could finish my explanation and take my hand off her bottom. Luckily, she hurried off soon after.  This was beginning to become a disaster. I needed cereal and I needed it fast. My neck was cranked, after the purse smack, to an area of the aisle I wasn't looking at before, and then I saw it: Honey Bunches of Oats. It had everything I was looking for in a cereal: the corn flakes, frosted flakes, almonds, crunchy clusters, and even some stuff I wasn't looking for, like granola oat things (which look like they are perfectly sized to block an unsuspecting windpipe). But most importantly, the cereal denotes healthiness, while it's actually not really all that healthy. I like that. Looks good in the pantry if someone sees it, but doesn't taste like wood chips. Isn't that what we're all looking for in a cereal? Unfortunately, before I could pick up a box the manager told me to leave. Long story short, I went home and bought this multi-pack on Amazon. It tastes like no cereal I have ever had before. And you know me, (edit: you probably don't), I've had a lot of cereal. If you are on the fence about trying this cereal, don't be. I think it was well worth the inadvertent old woman butt squeeze and getting banned from the store. But that's just me.<br /><br />Lessons I learned:<br />Honey Bunches of Oats is awesome.<br />Going into the real world is overrated. Especially when MTV has a show called The Real World, which I can watch from the comfort of my own home. And let me tell ya, when people start getting real, it gets real, really quick. That's the slogan for the show, if you didn't know.<br />Buying food online is fun!<br />Don't take Ambien. Ever.

review/summary: Dink the Cat enthusiastically endorses this food!
review/text: In the spirit of the developing presidential election...<br />"I'm Dink the Cat, and I approved this message":<br /><br />Last month we rescued a 2-year old domestic medium hair from our local Humane Society. Since that time, he has had to adjust to a new home (with a dog), to getting neutered, and to the transition from a mass-market cat food to this product.<br /><br />He's responded to all of these challenges very well, and really likes this cat food. We selected this for the cat after choosing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XKCDVG">a Blue Buffalo variety</a> for a dog we adopted a month before the cat.<br /><br />The quality of the main ingredients --just as with the dog food-- also made us comfortable with this choice for the cat.<br /><br />The smell may not be the best (imagine a 15-pound bag of fish flakes!), but the cat isn't complaining. In the long term, we'll switch this out with other varieties in the hopes that he won't get bored with the same flavor.<br /><br />With cat food: if the cat likes it, you've got the hardest part done!

review/summary: I Highly Recommend Blue Buffalo Kibble
review/text: I have been feeding my cats Blue Buffalo kibble almost exclusively for the past ten or eleven years, and my cats are doing great with it. Two of my cats, from the same litter, are twenty-two, and a third will be twenty-two next month, while the baby is ten years old. One of the older cats has arthritis but it is managed very well with Cosequin, and the twenty-two year-old had to have a couple of teeth removed a couple of months ago. Other than that, my cats are healthy and active, and I attribute this to a good diet.<br /><br />I came to Blue Buffalo when one of the older cats began losing fur. She was biting and scratching at everything she could reach and, as a result, her fur was completely missing in spots. She looked like she had mange, except that I don't think cats get mange. After a few veterinary visits and some time on steroids, it was suggested that she may have a food allergy, and that cats are commonly allergic to corn, soy or wheat, which are the most common ingredients in cheaper cat foods, and even some of the more expensive ones, such as Science Diet, which is what I had been feeding.<br /><br />There are several premium cat foods on the market that don't use corn, soy or wheat, and I tried some other excellent foods before I discovered Blue Buffalo. My cat's fur problem cleared up within a couple of weeks but it seemed that one or another of my cats didn't like whatever it was that I was feeding them. Then we came across one of the Blue Buffalo representatives at Petco one day, and decided to try Blue Buffalo kibble.<br /><br />All of my cats liked Blue Buffalo, and still do today. They like a great deal of variety in canned foods but are happy to be eating Blue Buffalo kibble day in and day out. I do rotate between the different recipes available from Blue Buffalo, but I don't think they would mind eating the same one all the time. Even in canned foods, my cats all like the Blue Buffalo recipes, but I include many other brands in their canned food selections.<br /><br />Only recently have I begun feeding them canned food on a regular basis, and that has to do with their age. Poor hydration can be a problem with older cats and, with four cats, it's difficult for me to tell how much water each cat is drinking. To make sure that they are getting some hydration, I have begun giving them a 5.5 ounce can of canned food, split between them, in the morning and at night.<br /><br />While I initially switched to Blue Buffalo for the sake of the one cat who had developed a food allergy, I soon found that all of my cats were doing very well with it. Although I had thought they were healthy before, the difference after a month or two of eating Blue Buffalo was dramatic. Things that I had attributed to age were reversed. Today, at twenty-two, my cats are as active and playful as they were at twelve. When I took the two older ones to a new veterinarian, he thought they were eight or nine, not twenty-two. In the eleven or twelve years that I have been feeding Blue Buffalo, my cats have not had a flea problem. Blue Buffalo is not marketed for flea control but I think that a healthy cat has a built-in resistance to fleas.<br /><br />Their basic diet remains kibble, however. I free feed them kibble, meaning that they always have kibble available to them. There are many good brands of kibble, as there is in canned food. My choices are to look for something without corn, soy, wheat, by-products, or gluten of any kind. Both kibble and canned food should have poultry, fish or meat as the primary ingredient. Every now and then I will do a taste test, setting out a bowl of another kind of suitable premium cat food along side an identical bowl of Blue Buffalo, and the results are nearly always the same. The first day, they will primarily eat the new food, as if exploring new and interesting tastes, but the first bowl to be emptied is always the Blue Buffalo. Cats like it, and it's good for them.<br /><br />A few things to consider...<br /><br />Premium cat food is more expensive than grocery store brands when you are comparing cost per pound. However, most of what you are buying in a grocery store brand (and some more expensive brands as well) are ingredients that cats don't digest well, such as corn, soy and wheat. Cats eating grocery store brands will have to eat more bulk in order to meet their nutritional needs, and much of that will be deposited in the litter box. On a diet of grocery store brand cat food, cats are more likely to gain weight, much the same as people whose diet consists mainly of junk food.<br /><br />After switching to a premium cat food, such as Blue Buffalo, it is not unusual for the cat to eat a lot of food at first, as real food may taste better to them than what they were eating before. At some point, often within a week or two, the cat may begin to eat considerably less. This does not indicate that the cat doesn't like the new food anymore; more likely, it means that the cat's body is telling him that he doesn't have to eat that much. Cats on premium cat food are more likely to regulate the amount of food that they eat than are cats on grocery store brands, but it might take a few weeks for that to kick in.<br /><br />Cats don't know how to read labels, so it is your responsibility to learn how to do that. I will let my cats eat whatever they wish, but only after I have limited their choices to foods that are good for them. Blue Buffalo is not the only healthy cat food on the market, and your cat may do well on another premium food. I think there's something to the Life Source bits that makes sense to me, and my experience has been that they have done very well with Blue Buffalo.<br /><br />I could say more, but I've gone on too long already.

review/summary: my kitties absolutely LOVE IT!
review/text: i only wish they offered organic meat but considering that the bag cost about the same as newmans organic yet the bag is almost twice the size and my kitties refuse to eat newmans organic cat food and devour this, they may know more than i do about the quality of this product. the ingredients seeml wholesome and of good quality with little or no by-products that i am aware of. although it cost more than conventional grain based cat food, assumably becasue of the high amount of goood quality meat based protein, my cats eat less of it, making it cost effective both by eating less food and using less kitty litter, and putting less stress on their systems.  Highly recoomended and cheap in the long run (not even taking into account the vet bills that eating low quality cat food would probably cost in the long run). I also highly reccomend ordering from Amazon since delivery was the same week, and with free shipping.

review/summary: Gave my cat diarrhea & dandruff :(
review/text: Before buying this, I bought the Blue Wilderness brand & my cat loved it. When she was starting to run low, I visited the pet store to find this- Blue Buffalo Spa select on sale... it had very good reviews so I thought why not give it a shot? I slowly mixed her original food with this one to transition her. Once she was just solely eating this, she got diarrhea. Oh, it was a mess to clean up and I noticed she also had gotten dandruff while being fed this food, too. I felt so bad for my kitty because I was trying to feed her a healthy food (and also save a few bucks) & it made her sick. I felt so guilty!<br />Despite it being on sale, this is not cheap food to have to throw away. Also, this food smells quite unpleasantly strong. Really had high hopes for this & very much wanted to like it. We are back to the Blue Wilderness Chicken)formula and everything is great again.

review/text: I am fortunate to be able to purchase premium food for my cat and dog's. My cat isn't a very finicky eater, but she does have digestive issues when she was fed the cheaper food. This product has helped with her digestive issues and she is also a lot more active. She eats a lot less when she is fed Blue Buffalo compared to the low end brands. This is a good price for me, as it is cheaper than my local pet mega-marts. I also like the fact that I don't have to carry in bags of cat food, they just magically appear on my front door. I have never had any issues with shipping, everything always comes wrapped well and arrives sealed. I just wish that Amazon would offer a subscribe and save!

review/summary: Beware - You will be getting Brown Rice formula instead of White Rice!
review/text: For what it is worth, I have ordered 15-pound Blue Buffalo bags of cat food from amazon three times. The first time I ordered "Chicken and Rice" formula [..]. I contacted Amazon about it and they kindly resolved the issue.<br /><br />The second time, acting under the assumption that the order was simply filled incorrectly, I reordered the "Chicken and Rice" formula and again received the incorrect brown rice bag.  While I originally thought they were simply filling the order incorrectly, I started to believe they were only selling brown rice and had no need for the other "Chicken and Rice" listing. Anyhow, they again resolved the issue so kudos to them.<br /><br />This time, convinced that the "Chicken and Rice" formula listing was a farce in the sense that they were only selling the "Brown Rice" formula, I purchased this formula. Surprise surprise, I received "Salmon and Brown Rice." Again, no where on the product page does it specifically hint at this being a listing for the brown rice formula. If you contact amazon, however, they will tell you that the words "brown rice" are in the product description and that because of that, it is accurately described. Their reference, specifically, is to this description:<br /><br />"Wholesome Whole Grains: Hearty whole grains like BROWN RICE, barley and oats will keep your cat supplied with the complex carbohydrates needed for energy. Healthy Garden Veggies & Fruit: Whole carrots, sweet potatoes, parsley and cranberries contain phytonutrients that help your cat stay healthy. Naturally healthy and highly digestible, Spa Select is a delicious way to provide your adult cat with the complete and balanced nutrition she needs every day."<br /><br />Okay okay, it does, in fact, say "brown rice" in the description. However, that is the same EXACT description that is on each of the Blue Buffalo products, even the white rice formulas (at least on amazon - [...] so it led me to believe it was BB's generic selling point. Whatever. Also, upon closer inspection, I think the bag in the picture shows "Brown Rice" (under the bottom right of the cat in the circle above the picture of the salmon) but I cannot be 100% sure since it is blurry. Regardless, to avoid misleading customers, the listing should be for "Salmon and BROWN Rice."<br /><br />To sum it up, buy this if you want "Brown Rice" but not if you want white "Rice." I know some cats don't like brown rice but luckily my cats don't mind it so this could be a bigger issue for some shoppers than others. I just wanted to bring this issue to your attention.<br /><br />Description of rating: 5+ stars for the food quality, 1 star for the poor description/information page and/or the repetitive erroneous filling of the orders.<br /><br />PS - I ordinarily don't leave a review for anything OTHER THAN the quality of the product but in this case, an Amazon chat representative told me to leave a review so that consumers and "the proper department" knows of the issue, whatever that means!

All in all, I think that it's easy for us to say that we're going to an Asian market to get barley tea, and it'll supposedly be cheaper, and blah blah bleh. But then it never really seems to happen... you may have noticed this phenomenon yourself. ;) So it's better to just order it on Amazon, IMHO.The only drawback-- wow, those bags are big! They're really too big to make just one cup, so I'd recommend making a larger batch. They seem like they'd be good for sun tea.

But they get a bit costly in packs of 2 or 4 from chain-pet-stores-that-shall-remain-nameless.<br /><br />I was happy to find them available here in bulk, although I was a little skeptical about the quality.  See, if a compressed rawhide chew isn't *really* all that compressed, our doggie gnaws through it rather quickly (and makes a lot of disgusting noises doing it).  I was hoping these would be tough enough to keep him happily occupied for hours -- and they are!<br /><br />They arrived loose in a plain cardboard box.  (Snikkers now gets excited whenever the UPS guy delivers ANYTHING in a cardboard box.)  The fun part is letting him pick one out for himself.  But maybe we're just easy to entertain around here.  ;)

review/text: I also received a batch recently with an expiration of December 2012, that was stale and awful. My bags were also compressed tightly as the other reviewer, Kirsten, said. I just ate half of my first bag today. (FYI, I only had half, since the small bag actually contains 2 servings, aka the 3.56 ounce bag is 396 calories). In that first bag, I had one chunk that was ROCK HARD. After probably 10 attempts to bite through it, I spat it out into a napkin since I didn't want to risk breaking my tooth. I'm incredibly disappointed with this purchase. I can't help but wonder if it was on sale the other week because the retailer knew this batch was stale.

When I got home I ordered a lot of 12 bags from amazon and it arrived yesterday. The individual bags of granola were very compressed and so the granola was broken into tiny bits - you're supposed to be able to eat this with your fingers. I opened one bag for a taste and it was completely, no-doubt-about-it stale - even though the expiration date on the package was 12/2012. So, beware of grocery items with severely reduced prices - they're likely reduced for a reason. I'm so disappointed especially because you cannot return grocery items. Blurgh.

It is a little heavy on the packaged oil, but it still has a really good taste.<br /><br />I hope this helps

review/summary: no flavor
review/text: None of the sticks were broke which was good and yes the colors are vivid but they have no flavor. They all practically taste the same. There were no different yummy flavors, they all just taste like sugar. Im very disappointed because i had rock candy before and the flavor was amazing. Better with every lick. This rock candy doesnt compare. i lick and chew waiting for the flavor but you can hardly taste them. What's the point if there isn't any flavor??? These rock candy sticks arent any good.

review/text: Arrived just as it looks in the picture and it sturdy condition - only 1 of the sticks was broken.<br /><br />First impression eating one was the great flavor! These are brightly colored and obviously heavy on the flavor extract which leads to some very tasty rock candy. Only downside of having so much flavoring is that the candy breaks apart fairly quickly in your mouth.<br /><br />Overall some of the tastiest rock candy I've ever had.

review/summary: Salmon Treats could be better
review/text: I've seen people offering these to their cats at cat shows, so I thought I'd try them on my cats.  I learned right away that I have several issues with them:  (1) They have kind of an off-odor, almost like turpentine.  (2) My cats weren't impressed.  They sniffed the treats, sort of chewed on them, then walked away. (3) The treats must be refrigerated after opening, which is not a huge problem but can be inconvenient at times. Try the chicken flavor instead -- the cats love it!

review/text: My dog goes crazy for these treats!  Also, I noticed that the price fluxates, so if you are on a budget, you can check daily to see if the price goes up and down. When the price lowers, I usually order a few, as this dehydrated light-weight yummy treat does not get hard.  My dog is very old, and only has a few teeth.  Even when this product isn't fresh, my dog has no problem eating them.  This is one of the few treats that she loves.  I even keep them in the car so that she gets a treat when she's riding.  That's how fresh they stay.<br />I haven't been able to find these in the store. Only similar items, but nothing comes close. Also, if your dog is picky, don't be discouraged if you try different flavors and your dog only likes one flavor. My dog kind of goes back and forth, but always comes back to the beef.  The chicken flavor is very messy, but the beef flavor is easy to even break parts smaller without any crumbs dropping on your clothese.<br /><br />Excellent products.  Thanks Amazon!

In fact he likes them soo much I don't know where the container is as he has stolen it and hidden it somewhere.<br /><br />I should also mention not to give too many of these to a cat at once, they seem to expand in the stomach, and after I gave him 5 in a short period, he threw up a HUGE amount of the stuff. But I have never had a problem with one or two treats at a time.<br /><br />They also do not have much of an smell, I've had some dehydrated fish in the past that smelled horrible, that is not an issue with these.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSWKBW">Halo Liv-a-Littles Whole Beef Treats</a><br /><br />We have purchased the beef, chicken and salmon for our kitty.  She goes crazy over all of the flavors.  I personally prefer the beef as they are easier to break/tear into smaller pieces.  The chicken tended to crumble slightly and leave some powder when broken.  The salmon is harder to break and tear which may mean too large of pieces for some cats.<br /><br />These do need to be refrigerated after opening so our kitty does tend to want to beg and explore at the refridgerator when we open it.

review/summary: Editing Review...Again
review/text: The first time I purchased from them, I was very disappointed in the method. I was apprehensive about placing due to the fact that I was writing a card online and I wasn't sure it'd get picked up. It didn't, and the receiver got the beautiful flowers and spent all day trying to figure out who they were from. She called the company and they said the note was "deliberately" left blank which is not true at all. I was left loving the flowers but not happy with the method or seller.<br /><br />That being said, I was contacted by the company and I now give them a 5 star rating for their efforts in making my experience better. I would absolutely, positively order from them again. And I appreciate them contacting me. I have placed another order and will continue to do so.<br /><br />Thank you Pro Flowers @ Amazon!<br /><br />Update...3/15/12<br /><br />They did indeed place another order for me, which was delivered on Tuesday as planned. And guess what? The receiver called me, after calling a handful of others, because again...the card message did not get delivered.<br /><br />I will NOT be using them again.

review/summary: Red Matcha tea made from Rooibos
review/text: I think there is a wrong description of this tea listed at the moment, this tea is made from the rooibos plant.<br /><br />I bought the tea since I do love the Japanese green matcha tea, but that is so energizing I don't want do drink it at night. Plus I wanted to try something new.<br /><br />I found that there are only about 3 companies who do sell red matcha. I tried this one from Red Leaf Tea since I saw that they had many different types of matcha available, even black and white matcha. So they appear to be matcha specialists! I sometimes cannot wait for my shipment of green tea to arrive from Japan, it takes so long. I was happy to find Red Tea and they are an American company, the shipping was fast!<br /><br />I love the red matcha, it has its own sweet flavor, I liked it without sugar or cream. It is very thirst quenching. I haven't tried it iced, but I read that it is wonderful as an iced tea or iced latte. I only bought the small size so I am conserving. I am using the rest to make just plain, I just add hot water and whisk or stir. It is absolutely delicious without anything added. It foams up pretty nicely also! I should have bought the bigger size from Red Tea. I was trying it for the first time.  Now I have another tea I like as much as green tea matcha!<br /><br />This red matcha is very healthy and FULL of anti-oxidants, even more so than green tea! It is a good tea to drink at bedtime since it is relaxing, but it also makes a good daytime tea.  I think this tea will be revitalizing if you need and relaxing if you want, it is unique.<br /><br />Try this: add some red tea matcha to warm milk or soymilk (any kind of milk) with your favorite sweetener. YUMM!<br /><br />I put some of the matcha in lowfat 1% milk with some vanilla agave syrup (I didn't have plain agave) and then used my espresso machine's steamer to foam the milk and create a delicious dessert.  I was a little embarrassed to try to get every little bit of foam out of my mug, so I made a second serving!  I still got every bit out of the mug at the end, that is how good it is!

review/summary: great flavor & taste
review/text: I am not one to drink fusion tea drinks.  But I bought this one because its coming from a brand I like and I figured, 10 tea bags was a small enough quantity to try it.  I love it, I think its caffeine quantity is higher then other teas, so it really does make a nice breakfast or mid day pick me up.<br /><br />I always smell tea before making it and this tea smells super fragrant and tastes better then it smells before its steeped.

review/summary: Best gum currently available, IMO.
review/text: The perfect size, nice, long lasting flavor.  Coated so it doesn't get soggy and ruined in storage or in your pocket.  Sugarless also!

review/summary: Stale and disgusting!
review/text: This product was quite disgusting and stale!  I'm not exactly sure where this old stock came from, but I was highly disappointed with product.  Legitimate Trident gum has an expiration date printed on the product, bright/colorful packaging and tastes fresh.  The product I received was none of the aforementioned and quite unpleasing to the palate!  Never again....I have learned my lesson.

review/summary: Missing pack of gum
review/text: I love this gum and it is impossible to find in stores.  However, I was disappointed when I received my gum and an entire package was missing.  The wrapping was clearly opened and there were only 11 packs in 1 box and the other box had 12 packs.  Very upsetting!

review/text: DON'T LIKE THE TEXTURE OF THESE SMOKED OYSTERS - ALSO THE TASTE IS LACKING. I'VE TRIED MANY BRANDS OF SMOKED OYSTERS OVER THE YEARS & THESE JUST TASTE STRANGE AS WELL AS FEEL ODD WHEN CHEWING THEM.

review/summary: Perfect with any vegetable
review/text: This spicy vinegar sauce is perfect on any cooked greens or green beans. You can add it to soup for a little kick too. I grew up eating it as a kid but my local grocery stores don't carry this item anymore. I'm so happy we could have it once again thanks to amazon.com!

review/text: I have recently gone organic and become  a "no refined sugar" eater as well as allergic to gluten. I've found it very hard to find a granola bar of sorts that doesn't have processed sugars, gluten (wheat, flour etc), is organic, quick to eat and tastes good! Thank you so much! :)  The brownie granola bar is just so flippin good! I'm glad it was recommended to me and I will continue to get them. I can't wait to taste the other flavors!

review/summary: These Make You Feel Great
review/text: Most health snacks like this are just glorified candy bars, yet I feel such a great energy after eating these.  My wife is a health food expert and she loves them as well.  They taste great and they are perfect for when you're on the run.  It's very convenient now that they are on Amazon.
