review/summary: Better than regular Raisin Bran which i like
review/text: The cinnamon and almond enhanced Raisin Bran appears to be slightly sweeter and crunchier than the standard Raisin Bran.  The cinnamon taste is bold but good. The crunch of the almond is excellent as is the cereal itself. I like this product very much.

review/summary: Absolutely great!
review/text: Here's a real winning combination - good old Raisin Bran and now some almonds - and the raisins are cinnamon-coated.  Pour on some Almond Milk and it is so good, you won't want to eat anything else!  I usually add a banana as well.  This is definitely an adult cereal - the kids can't possibly appreciate it, so let's keep it all for ourselves!

review/summary: Raisin Crisp
review/text: There is no question that Kellogg's has made some really excellent cereals from the past several years. But there have been some cereals that weren't that good like their newest cereal Krave. But with the classic Raisin Bran, it has never lost its taste and quality all these years. They have upped the ante with Raisin Bran again with their newest edition of the Raisin Bran family with their Raisin Bran Cinnamon & Almond cereal. The taste is quite good, and is delicious with each and every bite. It shows that Kellogg's isn't afraid to add some zest to a already classic cereal. I thought that it was delicious from my first bite, and definitely shows it. You honestly will not be sorry with this cereal. I definitely recommend Kellog's Raisin Bran Cinnamon & Almond cereal.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: B 1/2+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+

review/summary: Tasty Option For A Classic
review/text: I eat Raisin Bran regularly, so I was interested in trying the Cinnamon and Almond version. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Some cereals overcompensate with their flavoring, but the cinnamon seems just right. It isn't overpowering at all. The almonds didn't add much to the flavor, but I'm an almond fan. The flakes stayed crunchy in milk long enough for me to finish most of it before they got soggy.<br /><br />I'm also in medicine, and while cereal alone isn't the best breakfast, this version of Raisin Bran is good enough to be part of a healthy breakfast. There is a good amount of fiber, with relatively low levels of sodium and sugar.<br /><br />There are so many variations of cereal out there, and I usually buy the bagged versions to save money, but I will make an exception to have this one as a special treat from time to time.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I like the original Raisin Bran and it was a staple in our home growing up, but I think I really like this much better.  When eating the original Raisin Bran I actually added a little extra sugar, not sure why exactly, but I always felt that it needed it.  No extra sugar needed with this new Cinnamon & Almond Raisin Bran.  It has the right amount of sweetness, crunch, almonds, and cinnamon.  I was afraid the cinnamon would be overpowering, but it is a perfect balance.  Not sure if the flakes turn soggy, like the orginal flakes, because I keep eating it too fast to find out.  My six year old was eating it straight from the box last night and he said it was delicious.  I would definitely purchase this cereal again!

review/summary: Sweet crunchy goodness.
review/text: I have to admit I am a major Raisan Bran fanatic. I've been eating this cereal almost every morning for over 20 years now. I switch up here and there but not for long, I just love the raisan and wheat combo. This new twist really excites me because it adds almonds and cinnamon, two of my other favorite things. The best part is they got the cinammon mix just right, it doesn't overpower the rest of the flavors, it just adds character. I am sold on this. Great job Kellog's. Now when I sit down to write my children's book series<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1432744240">Tales of Wordishure: A Book Of Christian Bedtime Stories</a>, it's with a bellyfull of sweet crunchy goodness, who wouldn't be happy with that?

review/text: I gave this to my teen daughter and her friend when they were camping out.  They ate the whole box in one sitting!  She says it was delicious - not too sweet - and the raisins were plump and juicy, not overly-dry and hard like they sometimes are.  The cinnamon flavor was just enough but not too much.

review/summary: Add Fruit and Fat Free Milk and You Have the Beginning of a Healthy, Delicious Breakfast!
review/text: Nutritionists have always said that if you're going to eat cereal for breakfast, choose one that is high in fiber and has nuts and dried fruit.  Kellogg's Raisin Bran Cereal is high in fiber and has dried fruit--raisins.  Now, it also has cinnamon and almonds.  Let me say that cinnamon is a nutritious spice.  Whenever I go to Panera Bread, I sprinkle cinnamon and ginger in my coffee.  Cinnamon is hailed as a spice that has a wide range of health benefits.  It can be used to treat digestive ailments, it is a preservative (Egyptians used it for embalming royalty), it improves brain function and also helps control type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />  I like to eat yogurt with my cereal and an occasional piece of fruit such as a Golden Delicious Apple.  (See the photographs that I have posted on this web site.)  I added blackberries and blueberries (all berries are high in antioxidants, which prevent cancer) to my Kellogg's Raisin Bran, Cinnamon and Almond, Cereal.  It was delicious.  The almonds made the cereal very crunchy and the cinnamon made it very sweet, almost too sweet.  If you don't like cinnamon, then you won't like this cereal.  It is not a hint of cinnamon, it is a strong taste of it.  I ate this cereal for dinner and I took some to work for breakfast; I carried it in three separate containers from my Lock&Lock BPA Free Airtight Container Set(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054PHG2Q">Lock&Lock BPA Free Airtight Container, 28-Piece Set / 14-Containers</a>).  (See my posted photographs.)  At work, I ate some yogurt with my cereal.<br /><br />  Kellogg's Raisin Bran, Cinnamon and Almond, Cereal is highly recommended for healthy conscious people who love the taste of cinnamon.  If you love cinnamon buns and cinnamon flavored coffee, then you will want to try this cereal.  It's delicious and nutritious, especially if you add berries and/or eat yogurt with it.  When my box is empty, I plan on buying more.  It's a type of cereal that even my elderly, finicky parents will enjoy.  They eat Special K and Cheerios but none of their varieties.  I think my parents would buy Raisin Bran, Cinnamon and Almond, after they learn how nutritious it is.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos

review/summary: Crunchier Raisin Bran
review/text: Raisin Bran is one of the cereals in my breakfast rotation but I was a bit hesitant of their new Cinnamon Almond flavor because I am not the biggest fan of nuts.  But I could barely taste the almond (or the cinnamon either) and it really just came across in my mouth as just a crunchier version of the original.  This new flavor is highly recommended if you enjoy the original brand but are looking for a change in your morning breakfast.

review/summary: Nice and sweet and flavorful
review/text: Raisin Bran has been a staple of the American breakfast table since its introduction in 1926! This new take on that venerable cereal had me a bit dubious. They've produced lots of variations of breakfast cereals, and most of them disappear after a quick test run.<br /><br />This cinnamon and almond Raisin Bran is actually surprisingly good. It has a wonderfully rich bouquet, smelling rather like a nice cinnamon bread. And a big surprise is that it tastes as good as it smells. As I ate the cereal, I kept thinking to myself, "I've tasted this before." But, I never could place it. Perhaps I had a raisin-cinnamon bread before with the same taste - I don't know.<br /><br />Anyway, what I do know is that I rather liked the taste of this cereal. It's nice and sweet and flavorful, and definitely will buy it again!<br /><br />(Review of Kellogg's Raisin Bran Cereals, Cinnamon and Almond)

review/text: I'm not generally a fan of raisin brain, but I decided to try this, and surprisingly -- at least to me -- it's pretty good stuff. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars. Perhaps a fan would give it five, but it still suffers from one major flaw, and that is, it tends to get soggy in milk. However, I will say, this one stays crisper longer. So good work.

review/summary: Sweetened Raisin Bran w. Stuff
review/text: There's nothing fundamentally wrong with Kellogg's Raisin Bran with Cinnamon and Almonds. It is exactly as advertised, but the Cinnamon goes into a witness protection program for consumables when placed in milk, which reduces the product essentially to Kellogg's Raisin Bran with Almond pebbles. The product has a good taste and the flakes maintain their crunch, though they have a decidedly sweetened taste when just eaten fresh from the box, that may be overpowering to those sensitive to sweets. Mixes really well with fruit as well, I used strawberry and banana on one occasion, was a perfect morning treat.

review/summary: Tastes too good to be good for you
review/text: I've always loved Raisin Bran and now that Kellogg has enhanced it with cinnamon and almond slivers, it's better than ever.  The bran flakes themselves have been lightly frosted with sugar and to my taste at least, need no further sweetening.  Actually, I could have done without the extra sugar (18 grams per recommended serving), but it's certainly not overwhelming and this cereal just plain tastes good.  Even my husband who can be difficult to please, enjoyed this and would buy it.<br /><br />Taste aside, Raisin Bran really is good for you.  It's a rich source of fiber from whole grain wheat while being low in fat and it supplies measurable percentages of required vitamins and minerals.  Cinnamon and Almond Raisin Bran is a pleasant way to start the day and a painless avenue to better nutrition.

review/text: Regular Kellog's Raisin Bran is one of the cereals I buy pretty often, so I was curious how the addition of almond and cinnamon would change the taste a lot or not.

I mean cinnamon taste was pretty noticeable, but not overwhelming, I would not say that I felt almond a lot, it was a little bit crunchier but not much, and all together it was mostly the same, but I enjoyed the taste and would buy it for myself.

review/text: I've always been a fan of Raisin Bran, so I was happy to try Kellogg's Raisin Bran Cereals with Cinnamon and Almond.  Though I enjoyed this cereal, it wasn't quite as good as I would have hoped.<br /><br />Specifically, I liked the added touch of cinnamon and almonds, though I'd note that I wish there were a bit more almonds in the mix.  What I got and didn't really want was the added sugar.  This new Raisin Bran is sugar coated, making the taste of the flakes closer to Frosted Flakes.  I'm sure this will make this new cereal popular, but it's not really to my taste.  But if you like Frosted Flakes or other sugar coated cereals this may be a good choice for you.

review/summary: Tasty new Raisin Bran cereal
review/text: This is a tasty new version of Raisin Bran cereal. Whole grain wheat, rice sugar, and raisins are the first three ingredients.  Almonds are the 7th ingredient and even though I saw them in the cereal, I could not taste them. I was a little surprised by the strong cinnamon flavor being that cinnamon is the 13th ingredient on the list.<br /><br />It was impossible for me to eat just 1/2 cup.  A 1/2 cup serving is 200 calories and 240 calories with skim milk.<br /><br />My box arrived somewhat crushed so there was a lot of bran dust due to the flakes being crushed.  However, I doubt that is typical.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked the flavor, body, crunch and taste but would have liked a few more almonds in the box.

review/summary: Tasty. Crunchy. Healthy.
review/text: Kellogg's is definitely marketing the new Cinnamon Almond version of its classic Raisin Bran cereal as a "Heart Healthy Selection," which the front of the box announces, along with the claim that it's an excellent source of fiber (which it is--one serving contains 5g of fiber--or 21% of the RDA) and that it's made from whole grain. Don't let these assertions scare you away. Yes, this is a healthy cereal, despite the somewhat high calorie count of 200 per each one-and-a-quarter cup serving; in fact, a one-cup serving, which yields 160 calories, is plenty. But it's also very tasty, very crunchy, and rather filling. I ate it with a half cup of almond milk (so perhaps that augmented the almond flavor a bit), and it served well as the centerpiece of my breakfast for quite a few days. I'm definitely adding this to my regular rotation of breakfast cereals.

review/summary: Good for a Change
review/text: Between my husband and me, there are literally over 100 years of eating Kellogg's Raisin Bran (he is 70, and Medicare has introduced itself to me).  We both tried the Cinnamon Almond version for breakfast today.  My husband gives it four stars, and so do I.  The amount of cinnamon is just right; you know it is there and nothing more.  The picture on the box shows way more almonds than I found in the cereal.<br /><br />Comparing only the differing nutrition facts between the original and the cinnamon version:<br /><br />Original:  1 cup (59g) is 190 calories; sodium 250 mg; potassium 310 mg; dietary fiber 7g; protein 5g; Vitamin C, 0%; phosphorus 20%; magnesium 20%; sugar is the fourth ingredient listed.<br /><br />Cinnamon:  1 � cups (58g) is 200 calories; sodium 220 mg; potassium 260 mg; dietary fiber 5g; protein 4g; Vitamin C, 2%; phosphorus 15%; magnesium 15%; sugar is the third ingredient listed.<br /><br />The 14.5 ounce box holds about five servings, considering what we ate this morning, although the box says it is supposed to be seven.  Now as to the cost on Amazon, $7.55 a box, that is just too much; I will be looking for this in the grocery stores, but the price will have to be half.  All things considered, my husband would prefer to eat the original version anyway; I would eat this only if the price compares to the original.

review/summary: Tasty, but needs more raisins and almonds
review/text: Both my husband and I sampled this cereal and each of us had a different reaction based on how we felt about the original Raisin Bran cereal. He likes regular Raisin Bran and felt that this didn't have enough raisins or as strong a cinnamon flavor as he might have hoped for. He couldn't really taste the almond much at all. Both of us agreed that the sweetness level was about right such that additional sweetener did not have to be added nor was it cloyingly sweet. I'm not a fan of regular Raisin Bran and I thought that the cinnamon was noticeable and added flavor depth, but was not overbearing. I could taste the almonds, but wished there had been more slivers of them (but I love almonds and he does not). All in all, I thought this was a very good cereal and I enjoyed it more than regular Raisin Bran because the cinnamon and almonds added complexity to the flavor profile. My husband still prefers the original and probably wouldn't eat this again. I'd give this 5 stars and he'd give it 3, so I settled on 4 stars.

review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: This cereal is really extremely tasty.  I ate it out of the box by the handful instead of the bowlful because I did not feel the need for milk and sugar.  It is very sweet just as it is but after reading the ingredients list, I understand why it's so sweet.  The 3rd ingredient is sugar, the 6th is brown sugar, and down on the list is dextrose, malt flavoring, and honey.  Of course raisins are high in sugar too.  Though I thought the almonds, raisins, whole grain wheat, cinnamon, and wheat bran along with the long list of vitamins and minerals in it made this a really healthy breakfast choice, I have to rethink that opinion.  After eating this and then testing my blood sugar shortly afterwards, I realize this is definitely not a cereal for diabetics. I can not personally reorder this product but if you have no problem with insulin reistance, I think most people would find this cereal delicious.

review/summary: Somewhat disappointing
review/text: I love cinnamon and I regularly eat Raisin Bran Crunch so I was looking forward to trying this cereal.  For the most part I was disappointed.  The flakes are much thinner than the Crunch flakes.  I'd equate them to the consistency of Grape Nuts Flakes.  The flavor was okay but I'd prefer something more substantial. I would have liked a stronger cinnamon taste too but as it's easy for me to add more that didn't bother me too much.  The real killer for me was that there were so few almonds. I got only a couple of them in each of my first two bowls.  Once I removed the inner wrapper from the box I could see that they really skimped on the quantity of almonds.  So, even ignoring my preference for a thicker flake, considering that they went too light on the cinnamon for my taste and really skimped on the almonds I can't see ever buying this brand.

review/summary: Cinnamon and Almonds
review/text: I like Rasin Bran cereal normally so when I saw this new flavor I thought that I would give it a try.  I am not really a fan of almonds but there are not alot of them so they were not overwhelming.  The cinnamon flavor could have been a bit more pronouced for my taste since I really do like cinnamon.  The cereal stayed crunchy in the bowl and didn't get soggy.  I did find the almonds a bit hard for my liking (yes I know they are nuts but they were a bit hard for me).  The cereal left a slight aftertaste in my mouth.  It wasn't a bad aftertaste but an aftertaste none the less.  I may get this cereal again if I have a coupon for it but I doubt I would buy it at regular price.

review/summary: cinammon & almond raisin bran
review/text: To me, this cereal tastes no different than regular raisin bran except for the fact that it contains almonds. I really could not taste the cinammon; however, I do like regular raisin bran, so I will eat the rest of the box.

review/summary: Almost LIke An Oatmeal Cookie in my Bowl
review/text: This new offering from Kelloggs has good crunch and nice cinnamon flavor.  The almonds were a welcome addition.  It stood up well to soy milk and was tasty on its own.  The flavor is reminiscent of an oatmeal cookie and gets added kudos for the fiber content and being low fat.<br /><br />I did think it was a tad too sweet and I wasn't thrilled with the sugar content.  The almonds were hard and overall it would have benefitted from more almonds and raisins.<br /><br />I enjoyed this cereal and will add it to my breakfast rotation.

review/summary: Yummy Yummy in My Tummy!
review/text: Really, enjoyed trying Kellogg's Raisin Bran's new flavor, Cinnamon Almond, with Silk Pure Almond Vanilla Milk. I also, tried this cereal dry. In both instances, the cereal was incredibly good and crunchy. As a huge fan of almonds, I would have loved to see more of them. The ones that were in the cereal were very yummy, though.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Kellogg's Special K, Vanilla Almond Cereal and like raisins, then you definitely should try Raisin Bran's Cinnamon Almond. When the box runs out, I will surely be adding it to my grocery list and so should you.

review/summary: A Nice Alternative to Regular Raisin Bran
review/text: Kellogg's RB has been one of my favorite RB's for years, and this version does nothing to change that.<br /><br />The flakes are crisp and hold up well in milk. The raisins are soft, plump, and don't get hard in the milk like some do. The cinnamon coating has a nice flavor that is not overpowering. The almonds...oh, there's a couple...are crispy with a sweet coating.<br /><br />In the bowl with milk, the cinnamon flavor nicely compliments the bran flakes and raisins. The almonds don't really add anything to the mix. There aren't that many of them, and you really can't taste them when you get a couple in the mix on the spoon, hence the four-star rating. At least Kellogg didn't any dubious claims about added antioxidants from the added almonds.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I'd buy this variety.

review/summary: Tasty, but needs more raisins and almonds.
review/text: I tried Kellog's Raisin Bran, and this cereal is very tasty. There is just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar in the product. When the bran flakes are mixed with milk, I must admit the cinnamon and sugar tastes are awesome.  The reason why I only gave this product three stars is that the raisins and almonds are a little sparse. The raisins are plump and juicy, and the toasted almonds are crunchy and complement the cereal well.  Unfortunately, this cereal is mostly bran flakes. I think Kellog's needs to add more raisins and ramp up the almond content to the amount found in the Honey Bunches of Oats Cereals.  Then this Raisin Bran would be outstanding.

review/summary: Tasty breakfast treat
review/text: Kellogg's Cinnamon Almond Raisin Bran is a distinct improvement on the original.  The flakes are tastier, with a sweet cinnamon flavor, and the almonds give addtional flavor and texture to the mix.  The weak link with this cereal is actually the raisin content.  The raisins ARE plump just as the box says.  A little too much.  The contrast of the crunchy flakes, semi-crunchy almonds, and the soft, almost squishy raisins is a little too jarring.  If the raisins were actually a little drier and chewier they would work better in this mix.<br /><br />Still, once you get used to them it's actually not that big of a deal - this is a very good breakfast cereal.  One good enough that I found myself eating some as an afternoon snack!<br /><br />The cereal stays somewhat crunchy in milk, and for those who like their cereal dry it has excellent flavor.<br /><br />Kellogg's definitely came up with a winner here.  Give it a try.

review/summary: Nice new touch to Raisin Bran
review/text: I feel like Kellog's Raisin Bran has been has been around forever. I admit at times I thought the cereal was getting a bit boring next to its competitors, such as Total. However, I do like the idea of adding a touch of cinnamon and almonds. It's a relatively subtle and healthy way to add some new flavor to this classic cereal brand. And it tastes pretty good too. Overall, a nice balance.

review/summary: Perfect if you hate soggy cereal
review/text: I'm not a big cereal fan, mostly cause soggy, mushy cereal makes me want to hurl. But by the same token, I don't want to feel like I'm chewing tree bark. Anything with raisins is a win with me - at least if the cereal part is icky, you get a consolation with the raisins.<br /><br />My favorite cereal was and is Raisin Nut Bran: the right amount of raisins, the right texture of bran to milk.<br /><br />Kellogg's Raisin Bran with cinnamon and almonds is a close second. The amount of 'extras' (i.e., raisins and almonds) is perfect. The bran is crunchy, perhaps a bit TOO crunchy. It certainly pass the non-soggy test (but I'd also like to keep my teeth.)<br /><br />I used a bit more milk with this than Raisin nut bran, and the bran was still VERY crunchy (like grape nuts crunchy.)<br /><br />And it also tastes great!<br /><br />My only real issue is with how NARROW the box is. I know we're in an era of inflation and we don't want to keep hiking the price of things, but c'mon, Kelloggs. If you made the box any more narrow, it'd need an easel to stand upright!<br /><br />So if you like this stuff and can find it on sale, go for it. Otherwise, try Raisin Nut Bran (still my fave!)

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I have always been a fan of Raisin Bran, so it was nice to see a new twist on the product. I really liked this, though it was a bit on the sweet side. The raisins provide enough sweetener, in my opinion. The cinnamon and almond are a very nice touch that breaks the monotony of regular Raisin Bran. Have you noticed how the cereal boxes have gotten skinnier lately? This is no exception. For $5 you get seven 1.25 cup servings, which seems a little pricey. Hopefully they'll be a generic brand of this soon. But I still recommend that you at least give it a try. It's different.

review/summary: A fairly tasty cereal but overly sweet
review/text: So many cereals and so few mornings to enjoy them!  I remember the time when I would choose between Cheerios or corn flakes, now my pantry probably has 15 different cereals including oatmeal; however I have always been a raisin bran fan and often could trick myself into thinking I was eating something healthy (bran). 18 grams of sugar is not a small amount and with the addition of cinnamon added to the coated sweetened raisins the pandering to children's taste buds is ridiculous.  I admit I like the addition of almonds, but I believe this has been done before?  Using my box of puffed rice (naturally sweet) as a sort of base comparison, I was astonished to contrast it with the Raisin bran ingredients.  Puffed rice has no added sugar but is sweet enough, while the raisin bran has sugar, brown sugar, dextrose, cinnamon and honey.  (The last 4 items are under 2% but who needs them.)<br /><br />Could I become addicted to this cereal, probably yes.  But even after the first taste test (A full bowl of just raisin bran Cinnamon Almond) I knew I would have to mix it with something else (Shredded wheat for example) to bring down the sugar count and the calories (240 with milk).  My general advice is don't give up on basic raisin bran but stay away from the expanded raisin brans.  This new product will not revive the cereal industry, but push us more toward generic healthier cereals.

review/text: I love raisin bran and often throw in some extras, including nuts. This new cereal does that for me as well as adding a hint of cinnamon.  I'm not such a big fan of cinnamon for breakfast but the cereal was still very good, maybe a little too sweet for my tastes.  I usually use an extra raisin bran cereal with no added sugar.  Recommend that people who are looking for something different give this cereal a try.

review/text: great candy, just as you would get in the store, however they came shipped in a corrugated cardboard carton direct from jelly belly without a liner ( literally, the candy was just in the box with nothing else- no plastic bag, etc), which was a bit off-putting. However, I assume that if this is how I get it, this is how most retailers get it, meaning I've been eating jelly beans direct from a cardboard box my entire life. I ordered four different flavors of jelly bellies and they all came this way. No one got sick, so I assume this was sanitary.

review/text: I've had nutritional yeast once before in the form of a "Mac and Chreese"-in-a-box product and loved it. While it wasn't as much cheesy as it was garlicky, I had high hopes that "nooch" could satisfy the instinctual human need for Velveeta-style "cheeze". I could never find it at a grocery store OR a health store so I finally ordered this on Amazon.<br /><br />Wow. Yeah, I said wow. I used this in a recipe for "Cheeze Sauce" that was fat-free and it was amazing. Plus it had tons of protein, fiber, and of course the illustrious vitamin B-12! There are other similar recipes that call for LOTS of margarine that sound even cheesier and richer.<br /><br />This bottle lasted me about 2 recipes with a little leftover for sprinkling, so if you're new to cooking with nutritional yeast this is a good size to start with. I've since bought a 22-oz container of a different brand, but this brand is just as good.<br /><br />In conclusion...buy this, make lots of cheeze/chreese or any intentional misspelling of "cheese" you desire, be nice to animals and get 150% of your daily value of B-12.

In Cooks Illustrated I read about the healthy snack of nutritional yeast flakes sprinkled onto popcorn.  I bought some to try and can happily report it is delicious!  Hubby was even licking his finger to get the last bits off the bottom of the popcorn bowl.  Nutritional yeast has many other uses which can now be explored since it passed the critical taste test with hubby.<br />Being unable to find this product at health food stores I bought through Amazon.  The price was fair and shipping was FREE.<br />We highly recommend this product.

review/text: Although I always make my own guacamole, I was in a hurry one time and saw this in the produce section so I thought I'd try it because I really like Chef Bayless and I thought it would save me some time.  I read the ingredients and everything looked great.  Although i don't normally add tomatillos, I thought why not because I generally like tomatillos in other things.  I mixed this with the avocados as instructed, tasted, and it just wasn't very good.  It lacked flavor; especially the flavors one normally tastes in traditional guacamole:  garlic, tomatoes, onion, and lime, to name a few.  It should be noted that some of these are listed in the ingredients list on this bottle.<br /><br />I ended up chopping up my own tomatoes, garlic, and onion, and basically everything else I normally do when making guacamole to "fix" the guac.  It actually took longer than if I had just made the guac like I normally do.

review/summary: Loved the flavor - very good to use in a pinch
review/text: We love guacamole and always make it for parties, however, it can be time consuming.  I make the standard guacamole - tomatoes, cilantro, onion, garlic, jalapeno - because it is the only recipe I have used for years and always comes out good.  I saw a pouch of Frontera in Target with Rick Bayless' name on it and thought it must be good.  I loved it!  Mixed the pouch with 2 perfectly ripe avocados and a little salt and had delicious guacamole in minutes and really liked that it tasted different from the usual stuff.  You can use the pouch alone or also use it as a seasoning and add the other usual stuff.  I really loved the flavor - great to have if you need a time saver for a party or to whip up a quick batch on taco night.  I like it just the way it is for a change of pace from the standard guac - the only change I might do is to add a little more chopped fresh cilantro for an extra burst of fresh flavor and better presentation.

review/summary: Quick and easy
review/text: We love guacamole at our house, however it's always been a long process to make.  I found this by accident at World Market, figured I'd try it.  I thought this was very easy, generally one jar is for 4 avacodo's.  So if I have 2 I'll use just half the jar and save the rest for the next time.  However, the only down side, I don't think it tastes the same the next day, not sure why.  So I only make what I'm going to use that day.  It is hard to find in stores, Wegman's is the only local place I've found it.  If you want a quick, easy and good dip, I rate this a 5, leftovers I rate it a 2.

review/summary: Guilty Pleasure
review/text: We're big guacamole fans, but have always preferred restaurant fresh.  For some reason my homemade guac tastes flat, but have ocassionally made do with a dry mix.  We discovered this Frontera product by chance and boy are we glad!  It tastes really different, with a smokey undertone I wish I could duplicate. I don't think it's the cilantro -  maybe the tomatillos?  (I confess to not having used those at home before.)<br /><br />Anyway, teh Fontera is a little pricey to have all the time, but it's a special treat for my family.  I'll get 4 avocados - 2 really ripe and 2 not so ripe.  We'll have half the jar of mix with the ripe ones and the the rest of the mix a week later after the other avocados are ripe.)The mix seems to last in the frig that long OK.)<br /><br />I know folks who eat this mix it out of the jar with crackers.  Sigh!  At least we can get it cheaper than Amazon here in SE Missouri (about $3.49 at the local health food store).<br /><br />Everyone has different tastes, so I'm sorry that one person was disappointed in the product.  We love it! UMMM good! I think it's worth trying at least once, just to see if your taste buds are like ours.

review/summary: Disappointed Overall
review/text: I gave this as part of a secret santa gift for someone who loves to make guacamole. I was suprised to see that it's a condiment that you must refrigerate and use within a few days once opening rather than a dry seasoning. I paid too much for it given the cost of shipping only to find it available at my local Waldbaums supermarket. I bought some for myself to taste what I had given as a gift and was simply not at all impressed by the flavor it added. This surprised me as I have seen Chef Bayliss' show on tv and expected something more. I should have known better. Guacamole isn't difficult. Avocados used at the right stage are delicious on their own. Use cilantro, some sort of acid, lemon or lime, chopped onions, tomato and salt and you don't need anything else.

review/summary: These rubs are a huge hit with my BBQs
review/text: We are always having BBQs where I live and I am the one in charge of ribs and chicken tenderloins (stuffed with cream cheese and wrapped in bacon). Mea nwhile we got a few other guys doin some other food. BBQ Bros rub mixes are one of the best we have ever used. We like that there are different taste rubs for the different meat or whatever you feel like on that day. My personal best is using the Memphis style on the ribs and the Carolina style on the Pork, but that's just me. Best part is that you really can't mess up with this rub, no chance of over doing a certain spice. A++<br /><br />Little rib recipe:<br />Ingredients<br /><br />1 cup Bbq Bro's Memphis Style Rub<br /><br />2 cups Apple Cider vinegar<br /><br />1/2 cup Yellow Mustard<br /><br />2 teaspoons Salt<br /><br />4-5 lbs. Baby Back Ribs<br /><br />Directions<br /><br />Wash the ribs and pat dry with paper towels. Place each slab of ribs on a sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil and rub well with Bbq Bro's Memphis Rub. Seal the foil and place in the refrigerator for 4-6 hours. Remove from the refrigerator and place sealed packed in a 275 degree preheated oven. Cook for 3-4 hours or until tender. In a medium size bowl, combine the apple cider, yellow mustard and salt. Mix well. Baste both sides of ribs with the vinegar mixture and grill for 5-7 minutes per side.

review/summary: Perfectly YUMMY Unique Blend of Spices
review/text: I love trying new spices and rubs and when I found this I just had to buy this!  The unique taste of the barbecue of New Orleans is all about the special mix of spices and flavors. With the New Orleans Style rub I have been able to turn ordinary barbecues into a special dish. Coating meat and even seafood with this sauce makes infuses with an awesome taste. I never thought it possible that the goodness of the barbecue from Memphis can be found in a bottled product. However, when I discovered and tried Memphis Style rub I was surprised to know that I thought wrong. Now I get to enjoy the unique taste of this kind of barbecue all the time.  Next BBQ, I will try the North Carolina! Based on the experience with these first 2, I can pretty much guarantee it will be just as good!

review/summary: Excellent energy drink
review/text: I like the flavor, I like the fact that a whole can only has 200 calories, is enriched with vitamins, taurine, and potassium, calcium, and ginseng.<br />It is low in fat and sodium.<br />It is fairly low in sugar, but does contain glucose.<br />Note: 1 can is two servings, each serving contains 100 calories<br /><br />This review is my test-drive of the product.<br />I had a long weekend with alot of exercise, and not enough sleep. On the first day I drank a can after lunch, when I normally start to get sleepy. I felt energized and wanted to be productive. I did not feel jittery, but I am used to drinking coffee.<br /><br />The second day was the real test of the product, I had less than 4 hours of sleep, I ate a light breakfast, went on a quick 2 1/2 mile walk (under 38 minutes, and I am 52 years old in fair shape, but not very athletic)<br /><br />I drank a can of this about an hour after exercising, in a short while, I felt less depleted from the exercise, alert, and mentally focused.<br /><br />Just a quick highlight on some of the ingredients<br />Glucose is one of the quickest sugars that our bodies process, it is vital to normal brain function and is the fuel our minds run on.<br />Potassium, calcium, and sodium are vital to balancing our electrolytes.<br />This product actually has a better ratio of sugar to potassium than many sports drinks.<br /><br />I drank my can of the Caf'e Energy at approx 10 am on the second day, at 3 pm that afternoon, I still had energy and my mind was still focused.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this product and I will be using it to refresh my mind and body after exercise in the future.

review/summary: Not the lemon heads of my youth
review/text: I've grown up loving lemon heads.  They've long been one of my favorite candies. They come in two basic varieties: the small kind (that's on this product) and the bigger ones, similiar in size and dimension to its sister candy, Atomic Fireballs (also a great candy).  The candy is sour (obviously) especially when you suck on a lot of them at once, though not super, super souor.<br /><br />I bought one of these boxes recently . . . and was disappointed.  When you open the box, there is a clear plastic bag that the candy is contained in.  The bag is half the size of the box.  Back when I was younger in the 1980s and 1990s these boxes were pretty much full.  Now you only get half the candy!  Ferrara also sells this candy in a bag rather than a box.  Go with that instead, you'll get more value for your money.

review/summary: WARNING: From Best to WORST!
review/text: "All good things must come to an end" and the end of the great Season sardines is now.  Previous years' Season sardines were too good.  Season (Manischewitz Co.) no longer gets these sardines from Norway.  Now they supply low grade sardines from Scotland canners.  Last year, these were the best northern sardines available; now they are inedible.  Amazon's web page is in error . . . the package now says "PRODUCT OF SCOTLAND".<br /><br />They also switched to a much lower grade oil, "pure" instead of "extra virgin".  It doesn't even taste like olive oil.  The fish have a poor texture and worse flavor.  I couldn't finish one can.  Other sardine brands have switched from Norwegian to Scottish suppliers to reduce cost before.  These are among the lowest quality commodity sardines available.  Anything in your local store has better flavor and texture.  These Season sardines are rubbery and seem under-done.<br /><br />Please understand: I'm not just saying these are not up to their previous high standard.  I'm saying these Season sardines are AWFUL!  Don't be fooled; the only thing in common with last year's Season product is the name.

Boggles my mind that one reviewer complained about not being able to get all the sardine goodness out of the tin -- get a rubber spatula for goodness' sake ;) But what do I know, there's probably ergonomics to sardine tins just like everything else.<br /><br />This was a good match for that je ne sais quoi I've been tasting for in my sardines... I'm going to try a different brand next for the sheer adventure of it, but am glad to know I have a standby here on Amazon. The quest continues!

They were just too strongly fishy.<br /><br />But the Season in olive oil is very mild. I just had my first tin in a mixed green salad (spring mixed greens with added Italian parsley, green onions, and canned beets) plus Annie's Woodstock dressing (basically oil, vinegar, nutritional yeast and soy sauce which yields a very smokey flavor).<br /><br />If you want a sweet mild sardine, this is it.

review/text: Sardines...you either love them or hate them.  There is no middle ground.  To those who hate them, dismiss them out-of-hand, or have not discovered them, I say, "Good...all the more for me."  I've been eating them all my life and picked up the habit from my father who, out of earshot of my mother, would remind me that one day when I was old enough to be hungover I would understand the benefits of the sardine.<br /><br />Apocryphal stories aside, Season brisling sardines packed in olive oil and from the cold waters off Norway are a fine, delicate, healthy food which, contrary to popular belief, can be enjoyed in more ways than simply cracking open a tin and slathering them on saltines.  They are increasingly difficult to find in retail groceries, so Amazon is the place to go.  And the price is right.

review/text: I believe these sardines set the standard by which to judge others.  If your favorite brand of Brisling is as tasty and fresh as these, you're doing well, and if there's any doubt, then give these a try.<br /><br />These sardines are small, but plump enough to fill a can with one layer.  Sure, there are two-layer and cross-pack packaging configurations out there, but you basically get into the world of tender little tasty brislings in olive oil with these.  In fact, I consider these one of the less expensive ways to experience "gourmet" sardines.<br /><br />I put some ground pepper, sea salt, and a squirt of lime juice on these and microwave them for just about ten to twelve seconds to take the chill off and warm them up a bit.  Then I've got breakfast, or a healthy snack any time of day.

I eat mine with a little katchup, saltine crackers and a cold beer. I can recommend them, they have a light smokey flavor and seem to be higher quality than some others. I am still partial to the smaller double layer brands, but these will work for a change.

review/summary: Vegetarian Dog biscuits; Old Mother Hubbard "Just Veggies"
review/text: These seem to "hit the spot" for any dog in my neighborhood, and not just my own. So I would reccomend them as an altenative to the other biscuits that may not be so healthful for doggies.

review/summary: wholesome and delicious, I think
review/text: My chihuahua absolutely delights in this Old Mother Hubbard snack.  His ears go up and he jumps for joy when I ask him if he wants BIG TREAT.  I give them inbetween meals, since he is always demanding to be fed.  He must love the taste and I feel pleased that he is eating something good for him.  His happy crunching tells it all.

review/summary: The best cookie, ever.
review/text: There are so many dog treats to choose from these days but I always find Mother Hubbard to be perfect for my dog.  She is a real food hound and when I purchase the low fat veggie ones, usually in the "mini" size, I don't feel so guilty when I give them to her.  I also break even the teeny ones in 1/2 so the calories don't add up quickly. And, she loves them.

review/summary: Great for an itchy dog
review/text: Like all California Natural foods, the herring and sweet potato flavor is great for dogs with allergies.  Our dog is allergic to something in even the highest quality foods--we think it might be beef or chicken, but we're not 100% sure.  Either way, his constant itching and biting his feet cleared up within two weeks when we switched to the California Natural Lamb and Rice.  I wanted to have another option to switch it up with, so we tried the herring flavor.  Still great for his allergies, but I think I know why it's not carried in our local pet store: it STINKS.  I don't know why I wasn't expecting that... it's made with fish, after all!  But our dog loves it and it will make a nice change when we want to switch it up.  I highly recommend trying the California Natural foods before trying any expensive allergy medications or "prescription" foods from the vet.

review/text: My absolute favorite carbonated non-alcoholic beverage.  Not over-processed or  pumped full of sugar  Perfect amount of carbonation and very refreshing, great with meals or by itself.  Too bad it's so hard to find in stores.

review/summary: Delicious Lemony Beverage
review/text: When you compare the zesty Limonata Sparkling Lemon Beverage to other sparkly lemon beverages, you begin to realize the sheer perfection of the Limonata beverage by San Pellegrino. The balance of lemon, sparkle and zest takes this drink to the level of a gourmet beverage, which requires no mixing.<br /><br />San Pellegrino is also made with mineral water found near the town of San Pellegrino Terme which is located 70 kilometers northeast of Milan. The water flows from a thermal spring at the foot of a Dolomite mountain wall. The use of this water definitely adds to the energy this drink seems to possess.The carbonation seems more sophisticated and delicate. The only way to describe it is to say these waters are the champagne of sparkling waters.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: This is the only carbonated drink that I buy, aside from Martinelli. It is superrrrrr pricy on here though. If you guys live by a Kroger, it's only 3.99 for a 6-pack. Plus most of the time it is on sale for 2.99. It's almost criminal them charging this much online /:

review/text: I ordered this as a treat for my husband. He had tried it on vacation, he loved it but we couldn't find it locally. I found it here at Amazon and surprised him with it. The only negatives are the price and it has high sugar/calorie content.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: Prior to finding this on Amazon (why didn't I look here first?), I could only find this in one local gas station (which is out of the way mind you). Nowhere else.<br /><br />Sad =(.<br /><br />Then one day it dawned upon me to look on Amazon, and of course, here it is! This has to be my absolute favorite soda. It is extremely sour... but with just the right amount of punch. From what I've seen, however, you either like it - or you don't. And if you like it, you love it!<br /><br />Definitely try to purchase one locally offline before getting this six pack and finding out you don't like it. Or, buy the six pack and give the rest to someone who does!

review/text: We bought these thinking that they were not in stock in any of the stores surrounding us.  While under the impression that we would have to drive an hour just to find them, we caved in and bought these.  Not but six hours later I was browsing the local Kroger when lo and behold...  I spotted a lone six-pack of Limonata sitting on the shelf of the water aisle.  For one fifth of the price I paid here.
