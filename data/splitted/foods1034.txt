review/summary: Sometimes you feel like a nut. Sometimes you don't.
review/text: I love M&M's pretzels. They are the perfect marriage of salty, sweet and chocolate. If you've had trouble finding them over the past couple of months don't worry, that's just because stores can't keep them long enough; so if you see em get at least a couple of bags. These are just as good as plain M&M's, if not better. They do make some noise when you chew em but I suppose nothing's perfect. Nevertheless M&M's pretzles are even more flavorful and more chocolatey than Flipz and you get a lot more per bag (the Flipz bag is getting smaller and smaller, it seems). Anyone that likes chocolate and salty snacks should be sure to try M&M's pretzels.

review/summary: good, but not salty/chocolate-y enough
review/text: I'm a HUGE fan of chocolate covered pretzels and M&Ms are my favorite candy, so when I saw this product, I pretty much melted into a puddle of giddy anticipation.<br /><br />And Pretzel M&M are good- very crunchy and sweet, and very light. They are low in fat, too- you can have about 15-20 of these *LARGE* M&Ms (they are slightly smaller than small gumballs) for about 6 grams of fat.<br /><br />The problem is the that each M&M is largely made up of pretzel, with a tiny, barely-there coating of chocolate surrounding it, and then finished off with a thick coating of M&M candy shell. So it's basically like a candy-coated pretzel. Not much chocolate at all- less than on your average chocolate-covered pretzel.  Also, the pretzel isn't salted that much- so it's really like eating a candy-coated-unsalted pretzel. I've never been a fan of Jordan almonds, and these remind me a lot of Jordan almonds...<br /><br />If the pretzel part were smaller and saltier, and there was more chocolate, this would be the best candy ever invented. But right now they are just so-so. Which is fine- having only three or four at a time is just enough for a fix.

review/summary: Comic relief and a chocolate shell...
review/text: The comic relief being my review; the chocolate shell being the product.<br /><br />So the other day I was freaking out because the Archer Farms chocolate covered pretzels that I ADORE were not anywhere to be found at my local Target and I was totally dying from a sweet tooth attack.  I needed something, but the only thing that sounded good were those invisible pretzels.  Then, like a beacon of light from the heavens, I saw the most beautiful sight I have ever seen.  As the harps played over the loudspeaker I floated towards a rather large display hosting the newest addition to the M&M family; the pretzel M&M.  Now, the skeptic in me was a tad apprehensive (I mean, it's an M&M) but my tongue was craving some sort of salty sweetness and so I had to get a bag.  I finished it off before I got home and actually had to stop at WalMart and get a few more bags for the house.  Diets be darned (well, they aren't THAT bad for you), this tasty treat is the greatest thing I have ever had (well, not really, but for the sake of this review it is).  I now worship at the alter M&M and will forever he it's humble servant, you know, until they discontinue this wonderful product.  When that day comes I will cut myself and shed a thousand tears before returning to my life `pre-pretzel M&M'.  Seriously though, with the perfect combination of salty tang and sweet chocolate crunch, these little devils are just AMAZING.

review/text: These are very delicious!  They are quite different from any candy I have tried, which makes them very unique. I think they have well porportioned ratios of pretzel and chocolate, with the outer candy shell.  I don't think there is anything I would change to make this product better.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who loves chocolate and pretzels.  Now you can have the two tastes you love in one tasty candy!

review/summary: This is not good this is not good
review/text: Not good. I think M&M is trying to get us to like this because the little pretzel-like nub inside the candy is cheaper than a peanut. Also, the 'pretzel' is pretty bland. It ended up tasting like an M&M which you bite into and think 'blech- there's something inside this M&M.'<br /><br />Peanut M&Ms remain the superior M&M variant of the original chocolate candy.

review/summary: M&Ms for the calorie conscious
review/text: I saw these in a local store and decided to try them.  The first thing I always do when I pick up a piece of junk food is check the nutrition label.  If you're watching calories and fat but still want some junk food, these aren't a bad choice.  I think a regular size bag (single serving) had 140 calories & 5g of fat.  The lower fat content is achieved by being stingy with the chocolate.  You have to really concentrate to realize it's there but if you eat them slowly you can taste it.<br /><br />I shared with several co-workers and everyone liked them but didn't rave about them.  They're something I'd definitely buy again but for me, nothing beats the classic Peanut M&Ms.<br /><br />I'd give them 3 1/2 stars if Amazon allowed that.

review/summary: The best M&M'S EVER!!!
review/text: These are so amazing, tasty, sinful, just damn good.  They have to be the best m&m's that I have tried.  Out of all the flavors and types that have come out, these really are the best.  I mean what goes together better then chocolate and pretzels?  Nothing, and that is what they taste like, perfect amount of everything.  This is a must buy!  You wont be dissapointed that you did.  There is only 150 calories in one packet and 5 gramns of fat, not a bad treat at all compared to other candy bars.  I really hope that these are a staple because if they get rid of them like they did the crisp m&ms I will just be so sad.  They are sort of like the crisp m&m's only more of a pretzel taste to them, much better.

review/text: M & M Pretzel candy is the perfect between-meal bite when you want a treat that won't make you hate yourself afterwards. There's just enough chocolate to make an impression, and the different textures mean lots of interesting "mouth feel." You can also take your time with these candies, instead of just scarfing them down by the handful. Just about the ideal little indulgence.

review/text: This is getting real close to perfection.  I do agree with the reviews that indicate a need for a little more chocolate and a little less coating.  The coating and sugar overpowers the pretzel and chocolate.  However, this is a good first attempt by the manufacturer.  Hopefully, they are reading these reviews and a new and improved version will come out soon.  The world is depending on it!

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: I finally got the chance to try these & I have to say they're not bad. They're just not as great as I was hoping, unfortunately.<br /><br />These have a good flavor to them & I like the mixture of salt & sweet. It's just that at times the salt is a little overly strong on some of the balls. I attribute this to the process, which is where the outside of the pretzel ball is coated in what must be a fine powder coat of salt (since there's no actual grains on the ball). I have to admit that I was disappointed that the pretzel in the middle wasn't a traditional pretzel ball. It's just not the same.<br /><br />Pretzel M&Ms are good, but they just aren't as amazing as I hoped & they aren't really as good as actual chocolate covered pretzels are. They're good for those times when you don't feel like dealing with the mess of CCP, but they don't really come close to being as good as the actual CCP. I'll still probably buy some more of these in the future, but not as regularly as I might other forms of M&Ms.

review/summary: Not Bad, But Too Salty For Me
review/text: I'm a fan of chocolate-covered pretzels and I like M&M's.  I saw these PRETZEL M&M'S advertised on tv and after a friend recommended them, I decided to try some.<br /><br />The flavor really isn't that spectacular.  You would think that from the concept, eating a few of these would be like eating some balls of chocolate-covered pretzels with a candy shell. However, they don't really taste that way. There's more pretzel than chocolate which gives the candy a taste that is more salty than sweet.  It's not terrible, but it's nothing outstanding either.<br /><br />It's worth trying a bag of PRETZEL M&M's just to try them for yourself, but I'll take a container of chocolate-covered pretzels any day.

review/summary: The blue packaged m&m's cause cancer?
review/text: I used to love the blue packaged m&m's when they were first released in the early 2000's. Then one day, without notice, the Mars company decided to change the content from crispy to pretzel. For years I've search for the real blue packaged ones only to be upset and angered every time I walk out of a 7-11 and spot these crunchless crimes against humanity.<br /><br />I tried contacting the Mars family by both phone and mail multiple times, the only thing I got in return was a restraining order! This product and company have caused me so much stress that I have developed a brain tumor which doctors are now checking for cancer.<br /><br />Learn from my experience and boycott this godless candy. The normal ones are okay though, they melt in your mouth and not in your hand.

review/summary: Cardia Salt is the best thing I've done for myself in years!  And it's delicious!!
review/text: Cardia Salt is the best thing I've done for myself in years! And it's delicious!! Over the last 3 months I've lost weight, am not bloated and feel great - and the only dietary change I've made is switching to Cardia Salt. I use it for everything. It's delicious - and I'm a salt freak - salting cream cheese and toast and cheesecake for example. My friends would give me flavored and exotic salts for Christmas. Now cardia salt is all I use. I filled my salt dish with it and use it for cooking and all salt uses.<br /><br />I discovered Cardia Salt in a New York Times article that stated that it's not the sodium that's bad for you, it's when the sodium/potassium ratio gets out of whack, and that in the US we use way too much salt and get far too little potassium, which is in all whole foods, but not in processed foods we eat too much of. In Finland they call it Pan Salt, and I read in the Times article that they put the whole country of Finland on Pan Salt and reduced their cardiac disease by 60%!!!<br /><br />Try Cardia Salt, you will love it. Be sure to take a kelp pill to get your iodine.<br /><br />A note to the manufacturers - please package it in bulk like sugar or salt instead of the individual little shakers that are hard to break into. You'd save a bundle on packaging and customers would be less frustrated trying to open the shakers.<br />Cardia Salt (3-Pack)Cardia Salt (6-Pack)

Otherwise, this product gives chicken the best flavor, reminds me of the chicken that my mother and grandmother used to cook when chickens were raised on yard and we didn't have to worry about additives. I gave my sister some to use when we had a family function and she made some chicken wings and used Chef Merito to season them and baked them in the oven. After my very finicky niece tasted them before my sister put the hot wing sauce on them, I had to give her some of the seasoning for her to use because she loves hot wings. It makes the chicken taste good whether it is fried, baked, or grilled. NOTE: If you are on a sodium restricted diet, then you may not want to use this product often. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB22UG">Chef Merito, Seasoning Chicken, 14-Ounce (6 Pack)</a>

review/summary: Innova caused food allergies for my dogs
review/text: I had fed my springer spaniel and english setter Innova for 6 years, and they never itched.  However Naturapet, maker of Innova dog food was recently sold to Proctor & Gamble in June of 2010.  Shortly thereafter, both my dogs were furiously biting at their shins and feet in July and August 2010.  After several vet trips and medications (benadryl, steriod, antifungal) did not work, we switched to A Taste of the Wild dog food.  13 days later, the dogs are no longer itching.  This is not a coincidence - I believe either the ingredients or sourcing of ingredients changed when Innova was sold to P&G causing a severe food allergy for both my dogs.  I will never feed Innova again.

review/summary: Great Kibble, Bargain Price Savings NOT
review/text: At $45.99, this price is a great deal BUT when you add the $17.02 shipping, the total comes to $63.01!  I can buy this locally for $54.95 plus 6.5% tax for a total of $58.58!  I have check other places online and I have come to the conclusion that buying locally is the least expensive.<br /><br />I have been feeding Natura's Innova dry puppy and, later, large breed dog food to my 1-year old Golden Retriever mix since I adopted him at 11-weeks, and, the past few years, Innova Senior to my 11-year old Lab mix, 4 cups a day for the former who is almost 80-pounds, and 2 cups a day for the latter who is 65-pounds.<br /><br />For years, I fed my Lab mix Science Diet because it was touted as  recommended by vets.  But, when skin issues developed (scratching) I started doing research and began my dog food education. I was surprised to learn about "sub-prime" ingredients and how much grain is used as filler.  I switched to Nutro for a few years and that helped the allergies.  More reading and I graduated to Innova.  Expensive?  Yes. I cringe every time I buy a bag and a part of me thinks there is a very large profit being made by the seller.  But, knowing that I am feeding a quality dog food to my dogs, priceless.  They are healthy, happy, and my Lab mix seldom scratches himself anymore.<br /><br />The next step up would be Natura's EVO, a no-grain food, but unlike cats whose main ingrediant in their diets must be meat and would benefit from a no-grain diet, a dog diet may include vegetables, grains, and fruits, so I will probably stick with Innova.<br /><br />So, 5-stars for the food, 0-stars for the "bargain" price.

review/summary: Best thing I have ever bought
review/text: Innova recommends giving your dog a week to adjust to their food by mixing it with their old food. I tried that. My dog let me mix the food for two days then refused to touch his bowl if it had the old stuff in it still. The second it was straight Innova again, he'd scarf it down as fast as possible. My dog wholeheartedly approves this food. But beyond his approval, it gets mine and my husband's as well. My dog developed severe allergies to his old stuff, so we were told to try switching his food. There's still no signs of improvement, but as this is only the third day of having Innova, and the first of nothing but Innova, that's not suprising. I'll update in a few weeks if he improves, but even if he stays excessively itchy for the rest of his life, I do feel comfortable with how much healthier this food is for him. Go to Innova's website to get a full list of every single ingredient, vitamin, and mineral, and what each does for a dog's health, for each of their products. I highly doubt I'll stop buying this brand, and I doubt my dog would even let me buy anything else.<br /><br />Update: My dog still has severe allergies, and this food did nothing to stop that; however, it did make him healthier. His coat, what's left of it, is shinier and softer, and it's not the food's fault my dog happens to be allergic to chicken. That said, I don't regret buying this; it got me one step closer to finding a brand my dog could tolerate. I still plan on sticking with the company that makes Innova; they are the only ones that haven't had a product recalled.

Sucralose was not invented until the mid 70's!! Imagine TAB but with a taste of kids cough syrup and you pretty much know what I am talking about. This company had the choice to use sugar JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL or use Sucralose and they chose Sucralose. If you do not know about Sucralose, use this link ( http://tuberose.com/Sucralose.html ) to read more than you ever wanted to know about this government endorsed "cigarette" of the new millennium. They lied to you about smoking back then, they are lying to you about artificial sweeteners now.<br /><br />Just how few studies currently exist on sucralose is an issue. Endurance News provides the following table illustrating this fact:<br /><br />� Sweetener -- # of Studies<br /><br />� Saccharin -- 2374<br /><br />� Aspartame -- 598<br /><br />� Cyclamates -- 459<br /><br />� Acesulfame-K -- 28<br /><br />� Sucralose -- 19<br /><br />The same patterns with aspartame (NutraSweet/Equal) are repeating with sucralose (Splenda). Their claims of product safety and research results are identical to those used by The NutraSweet Company.  Note the comparisons and repetitions between the products, the corporations, and marketing.  Maybe now, consumers can prevent damage to human health sooner than with NutraSweet, which has damaged the health and lives of millions of innocent consumers since it was placed in the public food supply in 1982. Has the FDA repeated the aspartame approval process for sucralose, allowing a product with proven carcinogens to flood our food supply?  Only time will tell, as it has with aspartame. Yet at the cost of human lives.Knowledge is power.  As an educated consumer, you have the awareness to choose what you and your family will ingest.  Unnatural artificial sweeteners may affect your health.  Why take the chance? After twenty years of NutraSweet� (aspartame) dominating the sweetener market, people are realizing for themselves that aspartame really is a foul food chemical tragically harmful to their health. Now, people think Johnson & Johnson's Splenda, made from sucralose, has come to the rescue as the newest chemical sugar replacement "made from real sugar." People don't want to hear that it may be just as dangerous as aspartame, and this white knight of sweeteners is no better improvement. New chemical sweeteners (like Splenda) and the sweetener blends (aspartame, sucralose and acesulfame K blended together in one product) may be causing users to show signs of weight gain, disruption of sleep patterns, sexual dysfunction, increases in cancer, MS, Lupus, diabetes, and a list of epidemic degenerative diseases. The corporations continue to stand tough in their denial of any connection to chemical sweetener additives. The dangers of aspartame are now widely known, but the risks of using Splenda are not documented - until now. Splenda may not penetrate the blood brain barrier as aspartame does, hence entering the brain and creating neurotoxin havoc at the brain center, but Splenda CAN adversely affect the body in several ways because it IS a chemical substance and not natural sugar.

review/text: This barbecue sauce is delicious! Perfect consistency, excellent flavor, really a great barbecue sauce. It's nice to know that part of the profits go to charity, and that it's organic... but really, the main thing to love about this is the killer flavor! Kudos to Bill's Best for pulling off the best spicy barbecue sauce I've had yet (being a barbecue fan and a Texan, I've had my fair share!)

review/summary: PICK A PACK OF PICKLED PEPPERS!
review/text: Okay, I'm a homeless bumstress and I live in the woods, steal electricity, and have wireless internet.  (Yes really.  Pix linked at my profile).  Since money is not a problem for me (because I only have to pay for food), I like to eat REAL food (as in, real GOOD food), instead of flavorless food-bank and soup-line junk like those other bums. I soon discovered that with an electric fry-pan but no refrigeration, it is actually much harder than you think to make yummy dinner-for-one.  Sweet piquante peppers were a godsend!  They are extremely sweet, but also have vinegar--just like ketchup.  They look like cherry tomatoes.  Somehow, they manage to create these things without cooking them (like deli dill pickles), so they're REAL crunchy.  Their small teeny size makes them excellent snack food.  I just eat them one after another out of the jar, they're THAT good.  They're literally the only food I know which is both savory and sweet at the same time.<br /><br />"Peppadew" is a trademark.  The generic fruit is "sweet piquante peppers", but Peppadew is the only product which includes them because t(according to their site) these things were unknown to science until 14 years ago.  They ONLY grow in one county in South Africa, out in the jungle, and the guy who discovered them is the same guy who sells them as the Peppadew brand.<br /><br />Right off the vine, they're unusually sweet, and mild, and when pickled in sugar and vinegar, they become even sweeter.  You could actually serve them for dessert.  But since they're savory, you can use them to add a unique sweetness to sandwiches and pizza.  I LOVE Italian sausage sandwiches, and I slather them in cooked onions, olives, and peppadew peppers.  These days, Italian sausage sandwiches make up about 50% of my diet. If these peppers make up 10% of each sandwich, then one out of every 20 bites of food I ever eat is this product.  How's THAT for an endorsement!<br /><br />I can't make spaghetti here in my cozy cave, but YOU can, and I urge you to try and then tell how it came out here at Amazon. I'd LOVE to know!  I also put them in cheese fondue, along with white wine and cherry liquor.  WOW!!<br /><br />I always hate to throw away the juice because it tastes the same as the peppers, but I read on their site that other people feel that way too and use it as salad dressing.  Now that's a good idea!<br /><br />The sales of sweet piquante peppers has doubled each year since they started selling them.<br /><br />You know, laying around naked in the woods eating these things with crispy French bread and Tilsit cheese while you unhappy suckers work in quiet desperation at a god-forsaken office full of stupid people, evil people, and liars makes me really, REALLY happy I abandoned so-called "humanity".  There's even office politics in astrophysics.<br /><br />The only downside to Peppadew peppers is that they have no preservatives, so once you open them, they loose their crispness in just a day and become the texture of rotten tomatoes.<br />:-(<br />But that might not happen if you can refrigerate them--or eat the whole jar the same day, which is my solution!<br />:-)<br /><br />They just started selling yellow ones, and I'm ordering them now, which is why I'm here at Amazon.  I can't WAIT to see the probably-subtle difference between the yellow ones and the red!<br /><br />TRY SWEET PIQUANTE PEPPERS!!  Seriously. They're YUMIEEEEE!!<br /><br />-- faye kane homeless brain<br />  Read my blog!

review/summary: Best electrolyte replacement drink
review/text: I'm a disabled Vet with 80% of my kidneys gone. I'm on heavy water pills that deplete my essensil fluids. Cramping is my worst result. I started drinking Vitalyte, a glass four times a day and the cramps are gone! I sleep all night without having to get up and walk off leg and foot cramps. This is the greatest stuff I have ever tried. Makes Gatorade and the other 'kid' stuff a waste of my time and money.<br /><br />  When a physcial therapist told me about 'Gookinaid' I thought he was pulling my leg. But I bought it and tried it and I'm sold. I buy anywhere from 4 to 6 tubs a month. I fill water bottles and carry them in my car for trips. My wife even drinks it and has felt the great affects. If you have cramping or feel a bit run down, give this a try it does wonders. Our favorite flavors are Orange and Grape. Do yourself a favor and give it a try.

review/text: I am generally not a fan of pretzels. I have tried pretzel after pretzel in all shapes and sizes to no avail. I finally stumbled upon these one day and I have been loving them ever since. They provide a nice pretzel taste without having an overpowering amount of salt. I only have two complaints about the product:<br /><br />1. Brown rice syrup as an ingredient. While it is organic, I would rather it not be in there because of a few health effects.<br /><br />2. The pretzels are coated in salt and not sea salt. Sea salt is the healthier of the two and should be recognized as such in an organic product.<br /><br />On the whole, great product.

review/text: OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon!

review/summary: Future of Food
review/text: Much food that is utterly worthless can be, given some diligence, reinvented in a usable form. This is a good example. A normal pretzel has no nutritive value. This has protein and fiber. Some people would argue 'I am just snacking on these, I get my nutrition from my meals.' This would be a weak argument: every time you put stuff in yer body, you want to have some mix of fat/protein/carbs. Carb only, no fiber food, is not good.<br /><br />As to spelt, not sure what that cat is talking about, these have pea flour and whole wheat flour?

review/text: I like buying Paul Newman products because the profits go to his camp for ill children.  And they taste good too. These pretzels fit that bill.  And I believe the price is reasonable, as well.  It's great to eat pretzels that have a good amount of protein in them, unlike the "average" pretzel with just a bunch of carbohydrates.  All my family and friends like them too.  The only little downside, for me, is they taste a bit too salty. However, the rest of my family didn't find them too salty and thought they were just fine. They are low in fat, with 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving. I will definitely buy Paul Newman's Organic Pretzels again and again.

review/text: I started with Newman's Own Pretzels with the Protein ones.  The Protein ones are too salty for my taste, and cause me to have sweet cravings.  The Spelt ones are awesome, with a slightly nutty flavor and just the right amount of salt.  As a person with a digestive condition, the higher fiber content is a wonderful thing.  Since Amazon sells them in bulk, these bags of pretzels are less expensive than in the stores, with normally run $2.19 a bag.  My only complaint to Newman's Own is that the bags are too small at 7 ounces.  Other than that, it's a great product!

However, I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel!<br /><br />I don't like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor.  Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt.  While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt!

review/text: I used to regularly eat pretzels as snacks or part of my lunches for work.  Although I never really followed along with the low carb diet craze, I did become concerned that pretzels weren't providing me with any nutrition other than carbohydrates, so I gradually stopped buying them.<br /><br />Then someone told me about Newman Hi-Protein Pretzels.  Each generous serving size (18 pretzels) is just 120 calories, but you get 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber, with only 1.5 grams fat!  That's better than what you might get from a lot of yogurts that are on the market today.  Furthermore, like all Newman products, these pretzels are made with all-natural ingredients, including what flour,n pea flour, sunflower oil, and salt.  And finally, they taste great!  I truly cannot taste any difference between these pretzels and others--well, if anything, these are better. :)<br /><br />If you are looking for a delicious snack that is nutritious, too, I highly recommend Newman's Hi-Protein Pretzels.

review/text: I was excited about my high protein pretzels but when i opened and tasted it, it tasted burned. I inspected the rest of the bags in the package and they all look dark brown. I don't know if i just received a bad batch as i also ordered the spelt pretzels from Vitacost ( lower priced; not like here where the price suddenly got jacked up after being featured in Yahoo from $30 to $49!) and it tasted fine, no burnt taste.<br /><br />I am trying to return the package as i don't know what to do with 12 bags of burnt pretzels. But you can only return unopened one ( i already opened one bag) and within 7 days. After paying for the shipping fees and half refund, if ever they accepted the item for refund, its not worth the effort.<br /><br />So if you are still considering buying the Hi-Protein Pretzel, buy at your own risk.

Plus they're actually a bit healthier than most others. Unfortunately they're also more expensive, but I'm happy to say I always get what I pay for with these.

review/text: We love Newman's products...but Amazon lists this as 'wheat-free'.  The package ingredients label shows 'contains: Wheat'.  Not a big deal unless you have a wheat allergy...which by the way LOTS of people do.  Just thought I'd save you the hassle since food products aren't eligible for return.  As far as taste, my husband (not a pretzel fan) tried one and gave them a 3 out of 5....  'a little bland...need more salt.'

review/summary: Spelt pretzels with mustard - YUMMY!
review/text: We buy the organic spelt pretzels by Newman's Own. This company sends them fast and so nicely - packed and separated in individual slots so they don't break or pop open. The pretzels themselves are yummy. Lately we've been dipping into different mustard flavors - a great snack! A good variety of non-salted ones mixed with some salty ones, a good balance. They taste better than your average pretzel on the market and they are healthier for you. I recommend the spelt pretzels!

review/summary: Need to know how long they are?  How many in each bag?
review/text: These taste great, and when I got them very few were broken... on average one pretzel per bag was broken.  They are shorter than most pretzel rods, about 4 inches each.  I was making chocolate-dipped pretzels and was trying to figure out how many I could put in each gift bag, so I had my kids count how many there were per Newman's Own 8-Ounce bag.  There are about 40 pretzels per bag.  I ordered two cases trying to make sure I had enough, so hopefully this info will save someone from doing what I did--buying twice as much as needed.  Now we get to eat them.  :0)

review/summary: Mine Also BURNT flavor!
review/text: I purchased the High Protein Pretzels.  I've had Newman's Own Organic Pretzels before and they tasted great - but these are not good at all.  95% of the salt is at the bottom of the bag (have to have salt on pretzels!) and they have an overwhelming flavor of being burnt and not a good burnt either!  I have no use now for all these pretzels and i can't imagine anyone enjoying this taste!<br />It is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out.  I'd think maybe they'd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad review.<br />Generally Newman's Pretzels are really good, but buy these at your own risk....

review/summary: Review for the Hi-Protein variety
review/text: Simply put these are great pretzels. High roasted flavor, though my cousin said it tasted burnt, and proceeded to eat more. Very crunchy without any hint that it is fortified with soy protein. Only issue with the product is that every few bags I get several oddly shaped pretzels which are thicker and crunchier which is actually a plus in my opinion. The best part is that they're both organic AND affordable! My favorite way to eat them is to pair them with a good quality chocolate for a sweet treat.

review/summary: How can a pretzel taste this good?
review/text: A pretzel is a pretzel right?  Wrong.  I was amazed at how these really taste better than any I have had before.  I think these are the best tasting pretzel rods you can get in a supermarket or here on amazon.<br /><br />The malt really makes a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />The diameter is perfect for dipping in mustard or eating plain, not too thin and not too thick.<br /><br />They have an even and sufficient coating of salt.<br /><br />They arrived undamaged and very fresh with high crunch factor, not at all stale.<br /><br />Mine were not burned like others have experienced with their orders.<br /><br />I have 12 bags and am happy to keep a supply in the pantry to put out for guests when they drop by; it makes it very easy to serve good food at a good price by buying in bulk on amazon.

review/summary: Burnt taste and shelf life short or used up
review/text: I was excited about buying these in bulk at the special price Amazon was offering. However, when I received my case of 24 8 oz bags (purchased 2 sets), I was extremely disappointed to see a use by date of 1 month later.  Even more so, when I tasted them, and like a few others pointed out, they have a very distinct burnt taste.<br /><br />Pretzels last just about forever. Realizing these are organic would allow for a shorter shelf life, but the real issue is that the shelf life was used up before the sale. So, in short, these were essentially a waste of money as I had to coax people to take them away.

review/text: Discovered these online and looked high and low for some that I would not have to buy a case.  Well I found them at Whole Foods, bought a bag - then I ended up ordering a case since I don't live near a WF & I wanted them to be my snack of choice. Anyway, my VERY picky 13 year old daughter really like them.  They really taste like pretzels not like the gluten-free/high protein ones. My only complaint, dare I say it is, they need more salt!  Even sesame seeds would be good they need a little something more.  I don't think I will order a case soon b/c that's a lot of pretzels(!) but am hoping the word gets out and health food stores close to me would start carrying them so I can buy just a bag or two.

review/text: didn't know what the diff was between the "sticks" and the the "rods" because when I was little (yes, I really was little... a long, long time ago) I used to go to the "candy store" and buy two pretzels or pretzel sticks, not knowing that what I was really buying was a pretzel rod....live and learn...<br /><br />Anyway, once I realized that I had bought these "mini-rods" I could get on with the taste testing. Testing good. Up to the Newman standards...and there is this completely illogical belief that having the exact same calories spread over three or four pieces instead of one large pretzel is more satisfying...bonus...

My favorite Newman's Own pretzel however is their Organic Spelt Flour Pretzel. Once you eaten them, no other pretzel compares. Unfortunaly, very few retail outlets carry Newman's Own Organic Spelt Pretzels. The only stores I've been able to find them is at the Whole Foods Grocery Chain. There are not many Whole Foods around, but it worth the trip.

review/text: My latest purchase was the Honey Wheat variety, but I've had the Hi-Protein and Spelt varieties in the past.  I have really enjoyed all three of them.<br /><br />The Honey Wheat have a good taste and crunch.  It took me about five pretzels to get used to them as compared to "normal" pretzels, but then I really got into them.  I like the taste, but I also like the ingredients and nutrition.  The following can be found on the web, but I'm adding it here for convenience:<br /><br />Ingredients:  Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic whole wheat flour, organic honey, organic sugar, organic sunflower oil, salt, yeast, soda.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts:  Serving Size: 20 pretzels (30g), Calories per Serving: 110, Calories from fat: 10, Total Fat: 1g (saturated fat: 0g), Cholesterol: 0mg, Sodium: 180mg, Total Carbohydrates: 22g (dietary fiber: 3g, sugars: 2g), Protein: 2g<br /><br />Some typical advice - watch for sales on these!  I got the Honey Wheat 7-oz bags, 12-pack for twelve dollars in October 2010 (the price is why I decided to try them).  As of this writing, they are almost sixty dollars.  At a dollar a bag, I'll recommend them to everyone.  At five dollars a bag...all I can say is that I wouldn't pay that much for these, or any pretzel in a 7-oz bag.

review/text: The pretzels are tasty and convenient, but I can't give them a higher rating due to the extreme jump in price (nearly double the price it was a couple of weeks ago when I made the purchase-around $17). Due to this, I assume the previous great reviews are based on the former price. Now I can pick these up at my local Grocery for close to the same price per bag, which defeats the purchase of buying in bulk online.

The half sours I have had before had a great crunch and lots of garlic and seasoned flavor with a mild dill taste, these just fall short of my expectations. For someone else they may be great if the mushy part can be fixed.

Tink is a grey and white shorthair who had been found with wire wrapped around his paw and had to have 2 toes amputated. He had terrible dandruff and a bad body odor. Moe is a big ginger tabby - and he had terrible, dibilitating diahrhea, fur loss, weight loss, dry brittle hair. After numerous vet visits, a vague diagnosis of possible IBS, steroids and other assorted drugs with no improvement, I started researching. I was getting desperate - Moe was, quite simply, dying. I kept coming across articles about food allergies/intolerances. Both cats had been on Hill's Science Diet (as are all the other cats at our shelter). First ingredient? Corn. What self respecting cat eats corn? Other ingredients included corn and wheat glutens. I suspected that was the problem, so trotted down to our local Petco and started reading labels. Two hours later, I left with a bag of the Duck/Green Pea dry food and cans of the Duck/Green Pea canned food.  I weaned Moe off the steroids and stopped all the other drugs, and within 3 days (THREE!!) the terrible diahrhea had stopped. Within two weeks, I could feel and see a difference in hair coat. Within 6 weeks, Moe went from a sickly 8 pounds to his expected weight of 17 pounds. Tink's dandruff and bad body odor disappeared.<br /><br />So, having witnessed for myself what this pet food can do, I switched my dogs from Nutro to the Natural Balance Ultra Premium formula. Both of them (a Sheltie and a Bichon) improved in hair coat, breath and dry skin.<br /><br />Three months ago, I found an orphaned new born kitten. I bottle raised her and weaned her to the Natural Balance Duck/Green Pea. She loves it and is thriving. Healthy, happy, with a gorgeous hair coat and energy to burn. And then a 4th poor cat soul joined our family. Black Jack was at the Petsmart Satellite Adoption Center. He was enormously fat (they kept him in a cage with food in front of him 24/7 - again, Hills) so of course - he ate. 27 pounds of fat, pretty ugly, cat.  He had terrible rough, dry hair, excessive shedding and the worst case of dandruff I have ever seen. On top of that, he is rather homely - so no one wanted him. But he is a big time lover and badly needed a home - so he got his forever home. He too was put on the Duck/Green Pea. A bath, regular brushings and a much better diet, and Jack is also greatly improved. The dandruff is gone, his coat is greatly improved, with healthy, good hair growing in, he has lost a pound (more to go), he is healthy, alert - and very happy.<br /><br />I have to give this pet food 5 stars - it literally saved Moe's life and has improved the health and general condition of all of our furry friends. While the Duck/Green Pea formula is for allergy problems, all of our cats are thriving on it. With 4, I had to feed one thing for all - and this food is the ticket. High quality, manufactured in USDA approved plants, gluten/grain free, and without the normal protein sources, etc that can cause food allergies/intolerances. I would highly recommend this particular formula for cats with allergies and would also recommend any of their other formulas, both for cats and dogs. Moe thanks you, Dick Van Patten - and so do I!

review/summary: Smells Gross, But Tastes Great
review/text: Scampi Flavor Fries are not fries, but they are fried, and a delicious treat. They kinda smell gross, but the taste is very good. The treat is crispy, crunchy, light, and has a hollow center. I would definitely recommend this for hungry people like myself.

review/summary: very, VERY impressed!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised with the rapid ship date.  I ordered and received this item within a week.  Within two weeks of owning this adorable little tree, it has half a dozen blooms and over a dozen buds ready to bloom.  It was transplanted almost immediately into a slightly larger pot and it has just taken off!  Very impressed with the plant and the seller!<br /><br />Mine looks nothing like their picture because it is covered with buds and beautiful pink flowers!!!

review/summary: Excellent Houseplant!
review/text: I bought this plant simply because I want to collect the "ten famous flowers of China".  After I've googled it, I found out that Chinsei Azalea was the same as Satsuki Azalea. Hert's offers the most reasonble price for the same plant.  I received it in very good condition; attractive pink flowers and foilage, highly recommended!

review/summary: Dangerously delicious and potentially live saving
review/text: Well, unlike some of the reviewers here I know granola.<br />Good granola is hard to come by, it is even hard to make it so that it still tastes good the next day, because it requires freshness, high ratio of quality non-oat ingredients, small baking batch size, large oat size and flavor/texture variety.<br /><br />I hesitate to give this granola the accolades it deserves because I worry it will go the deplorable way of Be*r N*ked.<br /><br />I can safely say I have tried all the granola in all the stores on both West and East coasts and this Dr Flynn's Granola is probably the smartest and one of the best, up there with some of the small bakeries who make their own daily.<br /><br />How does Dr. Flynn do it, in a packaged granola from Amazon?<br />This granola is generous to a fault and has an opinion, called oily cassia.<br />Organic Saigon Cassia is not the dry cinnamon you get at the grocery store.<br /><br />Most granola is baked too fast, stingy with the good stuff and substitutes sugar for flavor, but not Dr. Flynn's Organic Granola.<br /><br />The high quality cassia cinnamon in this granola has a mind altering sweetness to it that regular stick cinnamon does not. Which means that Dr Flynn can use less sugar while giving more sweetness, and not only that, but instead of filler oats pumped full of cheap sugar, she loads it up with protein-rich pecans, almonds, cashews and coconut, wow!<br /><br />The prize goes to the cassia she found, which has more of the aromatic oils that coat and mingle gloriously well with the nutty roasty flavors in granola. It is like a healthy version of MSG, that transforms familiar flavors into the state they usually only achieve while baking. Just smell this granola, it is like opening the oven when you are baking cookies!<br /><br />Cassia also has some controversial and astonishing health effects such as a blood sugar regulating ability and anticoagulant properties.<br />With so many people suffering from blood sugar and heart disease related issues this granola, used in moderation, seems like it might be both a dangerously delicious and potentially live saving way to start the day.

review/summary: The best granola ever
review/text: By far, the best granola I have tasted in a long time. Unlike mass produced cereal products, Dr. Flynn does not cut corners as she has found just the right balance: delicious cinnamon taste, perfect sweetness and fresh highest quality ingredients (including full pecans, almonds, cashews and macadamia nuts!). I mix this granola with plain yoghurt to prepare a nutritious healthy snack which satisfies and reenergizes me after a long workout or uninterrupted hours of work. I highly recommend trying this product, I'm sure you will get addicted too.

review/text: I love this granola!  I finished them in just a few days.  It paired great with milk for breakfast.  Awesome just for snacking on at any time of the day.  The combination of the nuts and raisins was perfect and the slight sweetness to it made it SO addictive.  So worth it!

review/summary: The best granola and full of nuts!
review/text: I didn't eat much granola before, but this is so delicious it got me hooked! It has whole pieces of all kinds of nuts, and I especially like the macadamias, which you don't usually find in ordinary granola. The huge coconut flakes and organic cinnamon make this taste more like dessert than a healthy snack.

review/summary: Just Tastes Better
review/text: I'm not one who goes out of his way to find "organic" foods.  I try to watch what I eat, but an organic designation isn't a must for me, so when a friend suggested I try Dr. Flynn's granola, I didn't rush to order.  My mistake. I eat a fair amount of granola, and I've tried various brands, but this one simply tastes better than any of the others I've tried. And that's my test for reordering, which I plan to do regularly.

review/summary: The Best Granola I've Ever Had
review/text: This is the best granola I've ever had, and I've had granola. We now have three addicts in our house: me, my husband and our toddler. We usually mix it with Greek yogurt. And then we devour it like wolves.<br />I've had Nature's Path Granola, Mr. Johns, and Nature's Path is no Dr. Flynn's. Not by a long shot. Now please kindly send me your unopened bags if your wife hasn't already devoured them like a wolf.
