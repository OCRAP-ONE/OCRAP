review/summary: Delicious Walnuts!
review/text: I'd enjoyed these dry roasted, lightly seasoned walnuts for a couple years when they suddenly became unavailable in any of my local markets (and still aren't, a year later).  Good old Amazon came to my rescue and now I'm able to buy them by the 6 pack case which is just the perfect number that I want to buy at one time.  These are wonderful for snacking on, or, of course, adding to recipes.

review/summary: Emarald Walnuts, a little too much flavor
review/text: I first bought this brand of walnuts at my local store and loved them. They were fresh, crispy and had a hint of spice on them taht made them a tastey snack. I am trying to reduce my cholesterol and walnuts have the correct oils that help with this. So I bought a couple cases of these from Amazon. The nuts I recieved are just as fresh and crispy, but the spices on these containers for some reason are almost overwhelming. There are many nuts in the package that are caked with the mix of garlic, onion paprika, etc..., so much to the point that I have now taken to rinsing them off. This makes them a big soggy.., None the less, they are still a good value compared to the store prices, and you can rinse them , use them in recipes and they take just fine. Wish that they weren't so overpowering, so that I could snack on them right out of the container.

review/summary: My favorite nuts
review/text: My wife is 76 years old and is missing a few important chewing molars and found that these walnuts were very light and tender making them very easy to chew and enjoy. I have no chewing problems and enjoy them as well on occasion. I would normally have a negative reaction in my mouth when eating more than one walnut directly out of the shell, but with your dry roasted formula I can eat a handful or two with no side affects. I recently changed my ordering times so we never run out of these delicious nuts; however, we received an extra 6 can shipment about a week after a double order of 12 cans. I would like to review my automated ordering cycle so the canisters do not pile up. In addition, it would be nice to know what the suggested shelf life is for this product in their sealed container? Since your company is in upstate California and we reside in the San Diego area, your shipments do get here quickly after they are ordered manually. This may be a better option for us if we can still get the generous price break you offered for subscribing.  Armen Tavy

review/text: A quick recommendation, get the .5 ounce bottle, or smaller. And if you keep one in your pocket or purse or bag, make sure you swap it with the one on your counter that you use for the morning coffee. What happens is that the liquid dries up and begins to clog the opening. Not right away, but after several months of being opened. And once it's clogged up the single drop either gets smaller or larger. The issue is that you want one perfect drop! No more, no less. One drop is VERY powerful. If you get half a drop, don't try adding more. Open a packet of Splenda and add a tiny bit. You can easily get coffee so sweet you'll have to throw it out.<br /><br />There are a lot of reviews on this product criticizing it for drying up and problems such as I've just mentioned. Consequently, the smaller the bottle the better. The faster you go through it and open a new one the less problems you'll have.<br /><br />After a week or so of using EZ Sweetz you'll be hooked.<br /><br />I'm an Amazon faithful, but I have to share this with you: Amazon charges $4.81 shipping for a six pack. If you go to the EZ Sweetz website and order there it's $.99 to mail it to you.

review/summary: Has a bitter taste.
review/text: I purchased this product and tried it for a few days to see if I could get use to the taste.  I've used a lot of Splenda and like it.  I've started low carbing and wanted to cut the carbs out that are included in Splenda.  I've used this in ice tea and it tastes bitter .  I've tried it for 3 days now, and I still get the bitter taste after drinking it.  I did a little research online and have heard the same complaints from some other users.  The problem is believed to be all the preservatives that are added.  I thought I was getting pure sucralose and didnt realize there are added preservatives to this product.  I have since found that there is one website that sells pure liquid sucralose with no added preservatives.  Some people buy powdered sucralose and make their own liquid using only purified water.  I hope this helps.

review/summary: An excellent food
review/text: I have been feeding Blue Buffalo foods to my Golden Retriever, who is almost 3 years old, since I brought him home as a 7 week old puppy. As a veterinary technician, I am aware of many common health problems in the breed, allergies being one of them. Knowing that corn and other fillers can be the cause of allergies, I wanted a food that only used the best ingredients. I looked into many different brands that were reported to use quality ingredients. Blue Buffalo, it turned out, was the only such brand that was readily available in my area.<br /><br />The breeder had been feeding Eukanuba Puppy food, so I started "Bruce" on a mixture of the Eukanuba Puppy and the Blue Buffalo Puppy. He would actually pick out the Eukanuba and only eat the B.B. kibbles (one of my coworkers reports that her Dachshund puppy did the same when she switched him to B.B.). So, I ultimately gave up on trying to mix the foods and just fed straight B.B. He would, sometimes, pick out those "Lifesource Bits" and leave them scattered all over the floor but is now a voracious eater and is not picky at all.<br /><br />As he is now an adult, I have been feeding him a variety of the B.B. flavors. I started him with the B.B. Large Breed formula, then switched to the Fish and Sweet Potato, then the Lamb and so on. I am hoping that by rotating the formulas, I will be able to prevent or, at least, cut down on any food allergies and provide him with a healthy variety of nutrients. Since he quickly scarfs down any food I put down for him, I can't see that he has any preference to flavor. He loves them all.<br /><br />I can report that, to date, "Bruce" has been an extremely healthy dog. His coat is thick and shiny, his eyes are clear, and he is a very solid 95 Lbs. Everyone that sees him oohs and aahs over how handsome he is. I know a lot of that is genetics but I'm sure Blue Buffalo had a little something to do with it, as well.

review/summary: Excellent nutrition, picky eater likes it
review/text: Corn is BAD for dogs!  When I learned that, I switched immediately to food that doesn't have any in it (and most well known, readily available brands do).<br /><br />Our dog is very sensitive, and while she seemed to be doing well with BB's Wilderness Chicken, her poo smelled to the high heavens.  I read that it's often due to their not digesting chicken well; I guess she doesn't.  So, I switched her to the Lamb/Brown Rice formula.  She likes it, and, happily for everyone in the neighborhood, can digest it MUCH better (if you go by the stink factor).<br /><br />The only way she'll really go for it with enthusiasm (or any dry food) is to add some hot water to moisten it and release some aroma.  Otherwise, she holds out 'til right before she goes to bed 'cause she's starving.<br /><br />So, if your dog doesn't seem to like it, try adding a little hot water.  Our dog trainer (20 years experience) insists it's NOT bad for their teeth to do that (which I was concerned about initially).

review/summary: LifeSource Bits
review/text: I chose this food for my dog because it was the only one without a "filler" ingredient high in the list.  Although I've been feeding cheaper brands to dogs in the past, I've since learned about the potential pet health impacts of doing so.  Overall, it's working out but not as well as it could be with my picky eater.<br /><br />My dog's a fan of several different varieties of the kibble, but *not* the LifeSource Bits (the little brown kibbles that have all the antioxidants that are one of the main benefits).  He picks them out and will only eat them when he's *really* hungry.  I've read plenty of reviews on pet-oriented sites about dogs who do the same.<br /><br />If your dog is not a picky eater, the kind who never finds the pill you hide in the food, you'll probably have no issues with this brand.  If your dog picks out the "bits," you may have to feed him a little less or choose a different brand.

review/summary: Good for Greyhounds!
review/text: BB Lamb and Rice keeps my two greyhounds in top shape.  My male is a very picky eater, and even turns up his nose at homemade chicken and rice, but he bolts this kibble down.  I add a couple of tablespoons of BB canned food with warm water to make a gravy on my greyhounds' kibbles, and they love it.  Greyhounds require very high protein feed in measured amounts or they don't thrive.  I've found this product to be excellent for them.

review/text: I discovered pickled okra (another brand) in a local store, but haven't found it again.  After developing a craving, I finally went to Amazon and found several brands.  There can be an enormous variation in taste and texture in this kind of product and went with Tabasco out of faith in the brand.  For $2.50 for a 12 oz. jar, the price is more than reasonable.  Tastes great.  Just crunchy enough, but the $7+ shipping makes the total cost at least $4.00 over comparable product if available here.  An included $1.00 coupon took a little off the pain.<br /><br />I sure liked the taste, but total cost outweighs value.<br /><br />I'll try a similar product with cheaper shipping and hope for luck of the draw good taste.

review/summary: Terrible Customer Service from Euro Food Mart
review/text: I ordered this item and several other choclate items from Euro Food Mart and was sorely disappointed in the products I received. They arrived melted. I didn't realize that I needed to have them shipped EXPEDITED. I mistakenly assumed that by paying $12 for shipping, the items would arrive with some kind of coolant. Previous to placing the order I clicked on the Shipping link for detail, and perused the chart that appeared. I failed to scroll down and see the information stating that in order to assure the use of ice gels, orders needed to be Expedited. So, on a $26 order, I would pay an additional $30+ for Expedited delivery. When I initially received my melted chocolates, I contacted Euro Food Mart and received a very rude and curt reply from Cris in Customer Service informing me that during the checkout process I was offered shipping with ice gels, but I chose to decline it. Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated. They cracked easily and no filling was discernable. Admittedly, it was my mistake not to notice the note on Expedited shipping, however, the response from Euro Food Mart's Customer Service lacked objectivity. My rating reflects my entire experience....quality of shipped product and customer service provided by Euro Food Mart.

review/text: I buy Ritter Sport Minis at my local (SE Wisconsin) Aldi food store. They come in a couple different assortments of milk chocolate varieties, and the minis are the perfect size for a bit of chocolate without going overboard! Best thing, at Aldi, they are only $2.49 a pack!

review/text: Included in the assortment:<br /><br />* 2x milk chocolate<br />* 2x yogurt<br />* cornflake<br />* praline<br />* marzipan<br />* chopped hazelnuts<br /><br />Each bar is .6 oz, and feels about 1/4 the size of a full size ritter bar.  That means for the price listed, you're only getting 6oz total.  If you're concerned with value, compare the price per ounce against other assortments available.

review/summary: German chocolates
review/text: I bought these for my 2008 Oktoberfest and because I was in beautiful Munich, Bamberg, and Nuernberg in February of 2008 and had plenty of these little Ritter Sport jewels.  You can find these packages of mini Ritters all over Germany they are so popular, but I have only seen their larger individually-wrapped cousins here on the shelves.  As with any variety pack, you get much more of a choice of experiences--some old, some new.  I think the biggest advantage to ordering this package was that I got to try so many of the Ritter Sports that I had not ever tried before.  The only disadvantage I can think of is that the chocolates were not as fresh, of course, as they are in Deutschland.  But I guess you'll have to go there to know what I mean!

review/summary: Terrible Flavor!!!
review/text: I recently started eating healthier and needed a low calorie chip to eat with lunches at work. I usually love anything ranch flavored and was excited to try the new Southwest Ranch cracker chips. Their flavor was actually TERRIBLE! I literally thought they tasted like poo. I could only force myself to eat two or three chips. I then had my friend taste them (hoping I could give away the box) and he hated them too. Now I have almost a whole box of these  that I will be throwing away. The texture wasn't very appealing either so I'm not sure if I will ever try another flavor.

review/text: Love these crackers.  They're very satisfying without being too salty or sweet.  Unfortunately a large number of crackers were broken in each package.  Based on the packaging.......crackers in a row in light cardstock box wrapped in cellophane.....it's probably not possible to ship without alot of breakage. For this reason, I probably won't order this item online again.

You will get a buzz out of the caffeine and guarana in the brew, so it's a good substitute for your morning coffee. Plus: it's made with nice cane sugar, not nasty corn syrup. One caveat, sodium benzoate is used "to preserve freshness" on this and many soft drinks; I read that it should not be taken with citrus. Enjoy!

review/text: My kids and I love root beer and I brew my own from time to time. Recently while purchasing some specialty versions from a local store I saw the Jack Blacks Red Dead Root Beer and thought the label was cool so I grabbed a couple. After we sampled it, all I can say is don't waste your time. It has little to no root beer flavor,it finishes a little spicy in fact. It has caffine added which was a bit of a put off as well. I was very disappointed with the flavor of this product. If you want a pick me up and you don't mind it tasting like sugar water mixed with dish soap then this is the drink for you.

review/summary: Satisfy that Sweet Tooth!
review/text: So about a year and a half ago I finally started changing my eating habits. Including cutting out the junk food. I was rewarded with a 160lb reduction in my weight, I have about 50 more to lose. And I was able to get off my medication for High blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Which are both now controlled just with diet and exercise alone.<br />Still, I haven't lost my sweet tooth and so finding ways to satisfy it while maintaining my good eating habits is a must. One of the things I like to have once in while is low fat popcorn like this. I don't eat it too often because of the salt but it's great for those times that snacking urge is undeniable! I've had other brands of kettle corn but this one is pretty good, if not the best. I also like that the whole bag which is the large kind is only about 100 calories. So no guilt if you eat more than your fair share. ^_^<br />Other brands I've had were only half this size but had the same amount of calories.<br /><br />Great tasting popcorn, great size!

review/summary: 2011 Chef's Best Award for Nong Shim's Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:09 Mins<br /><br /></span>My eight-year-old son volunteered to try Nong Shim's new flavor, spicy chicken. I made a video interview of him eating the noodles for dinner, after he came home from judo practice (hungry).<br /><br />Our family enjoys Nong Shim instant noodles. We stock our pantry every autumn with bowls of ramen, yakisoba and udon. Nong Shim is the leading brand of ramyoen (ramen instant noodles) in South Korea.<br /><br />The package design is getting better. The endorsement by Professional Chefs (a 2011 Chef's Best Award) is easier to read and three colored boxes in the lower right corner note that the noodles have no MSG added, there's 30% less sodium than their regular product and that the noodles have 0 grams of trans fat.<br /><br />I recommend adding refrigerator scraps to your instant noodles; perhaps, whole kernel corn (for sweetness) or some tofu, finely chopped green onions (scallions), chopped, cooked beef, chicken or seafood. An egg is another delicious addition.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />Earlier this year, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, executive editor at Serious Eats, posted "Ramen Hacks: 30+ Easy Ways to Upgrade Your Instant Noodles." I highly recommend you search out and read the full article because you will never go back to relying on the flavoring packet alone to make instant noodles.<br /><br />I distilled his tips down to these four bullet points:<br /><br />* Simple Add-ins -- Miso paste, chili bean sauce, Thai curry paste, Japanese curry powder, fish sauce, harrisa, vinegar and ponzu.<br /><br />* Vegetation -- Baby spinach, romaine lettuce, bean sprouts, thinly sliced cabbage, watercress, and scallions "should wilt in a matter of seconds."<br /><br />* Eggs -- Hard boiled, soft boiled, the egg-drop method, poached eggs and fried eggs.<br /><br />* Simple Simmered Meat -- Thinly sliced meats cook in a matter of seconds directly in the pot. Chicken breast, pork tenderloin, or flank steak are all great candidates.<br /><br />Instant noodles available at Amazon that our family eats and recommends:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MOX6RA">Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Udon</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MP136A">Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Kimchi</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00171FB7I">Nong Shim Beef and Ginger Bowl</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQNK5A">Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Bowl</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028PDFQG">Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba Noodles</a><br /><br />In many cases you can sign up for Amazon's Subscribe & Save program for additional savings and convenience.

review/summary: Delicious, Highly Spiced Noodle Bowl, Still High in Sodium
review/text: One bowl (2 servings) makes a filling lunch for one.  The highly spiced chicken flavoring (definitely not for wimps!) is quite tasty.  The extra-long, curly noodles are delicious.  There are no vegetable or chicken bits in the bowl--the ones shown on the package label are apparently garnishes added for the photo shoot.  The ingredients list reveals more beef flavorings than chicken flavorings.<br /><br />The food prep couldn't be easier: (1) pull back the cover, (2) open the seasonings packet and dump it in, (3) fill the bowl with room temperature water, (4) microwave for 3 minutes, and (5) let cool for at least one minute before eating.  One is wise to heed the instructions to wait a bit before eating--my microwaved noodles were still too hot to eat after three or four minutes.  The bowl can also be prepared by adding hot water and letting the mixture steep for three minutes.<br /><br />Unfortunately,  the 2-serving bowl--and who eats only half a bowl of noodles?--delivers a whopping 1780 mg of sodium, even though this particular product has 30% less sodium than the manufacturer's regular product.  The FDA recommended daily intake for sodium is about 2300 mg of sodium, so if you eat the whole bowl, you have consumed about 77% of your day's recommended sodium.  (The package label is reasonably honest, stating that 1 serving delivers 37% of your daily sodium.)<br /><br />Because my diet is generally a low-salt one (by choice, not for medical reasons), I could tell that some of the spicy flavor was coming from salt rather than from other seasonings.  However, the product did not make me immediately thirsty, as most high-salt commercial food products do.  For me, this product is worth only three stars ("it's okay"), because I can't eat it on a regular basis and still keep my salt intake down.  That's too bad, because a product like this is great to have on the pantry shelf to pull out for a quick meal.

review/summary: A Spicy Meal Alternative... But Pricy...
review/text: I actually purchased a pack of NongShim Spicy Chicken bowls (pk of 12) from a local warehouse in my area.  Ever since college I've been a fan of these "cup of noodles" style meals during late Autumn and Winter.  Makes for quick alternative meal that warms you up.  How does Nongshim's spicy chicken version stand up against other brands I've had?<br /><br />Pretty good actually!  Each bowl contains a fairly large amount of noodles, compared to the cup variety.  The noodles are your typical standard dried Ramen noodle.  I am not a big fan of microwaving these products so I make mine by boiling water.  Just put some water up to boil, open the package and add the "flavor pouch" or Soup Base, add boiling water to the fill line and wait 3 minutes.  Instant hot soup with noodles.  While the noodles are standard , the broth is really good.  It has a lot of flavor to it and a good spicy kick to it.  Put the two of them together and you get a very satisfying meal that will fill you up, and wake you up.<br /><br />Despite having a good spicy broth and making for a  filling meal... This product does have some CONS I am wary of.  For one the product contains almost 1800mg of sodium for a single bowl.  This is insane!  Most of these cup/bowl of noodles are overloaded with sodium to begin with, but it still needs to be pointed out.  The fat content is a bit high also, at 14g for an entire bowl.  Another problem I have is that most of the products I've tried usually come in a sturdy container for your product.  Nongshim's Spicy Chicken Bowls come in a flimsy plastic bowl.  It works fine but once prepared I would definitely suggest carrying with two hands, as it has a very cheap feel to the bowl.  The price per bowl is also a bit expensive.  At the warehouse I purchased this, I paid $9 for 12 bowls.  I could of paid $6.50 for 24 cup of noodle varieties.  Compared to the cup variety, you are paying a premium for these; And while the bowl produced better quality broth, I don't see it being worth the price increase. (12 bowls = 24 servings.. $9 for 24 servings.  the cups were $6.50 for 24 servings.. so basically $2.50 more for bowls vs cups)<br /><br />OVERALL I would give this product 4 stars.  Despite having a flimsy bowl, and incredibly high amount of sodium the product makes up for it in the overall quality of its taste and sheer volume of noodles.  You get a big meal here that will both fill you, and warm you up.  It has a really nice spicy kick to the broth that lingers without becoming annoying(see NOTE).  I've always enjoyed spicy foods so having a few of these laying around the house helps if I just want a quick meal.  I would not recommend eating these everyday, in fact maybe I tend to aim for one a week.  Products like this are not exactly the healthiest alternative meal for you, but if you need a quick emergency meal these are a good alternative.<br /><br />NOTE: The product contains chicken but I really wouldn't call it chicken.  You might find a few tiny little bits of re-hydrated chicken<br />NOTE: I do not use the entire flavor/soup base packet.  The amount of sodium it contains is ridiculous!  I use no more than 3/4 of the packet.  I tried using the entire packet once and it made the broth start to taste far too salty, as well as making the spice in the broth overpower rather than compliment.  Don't be afraid to use less of the packet...

review/summary: Tasty, but overpriced and unhealthy
review/text: I had my picky 15-year-old son to try this Nong Shim Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl, and he liked it a lot: "The flavor is good.  Has a major spiciness, which I like.  Little overpriced.  For the price, I'd probably just get ramen.  Can't really taste the chicken.  The picture on the package is misleading; the chicken chunks aren't that big.  Overall, quite good." But he complained that there are two lines inside the bowl, so he didn't know which to fill it to (he used the lower line).<br /><br />These are basically like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047TAKQ4">Cup O Noodles</a> almost everyone has had at some point, but a little bigger and with a more complex taste.  Very handy and easy to prepare, but definitely overpriced for what you're getting.  And the nutrition numbers make it something you won't want to eat regularly.  This 3-oz bowl is unrealistically listed as two servings.  Who is going to split a noodle cup??  If you eat the whole thing, it has 380 calories, 14g fat, 1780mg sodium, 56g carbs, 2g fiber, and 8g protein.<br /><br />This wouldn't be a terrible option to keep in a desk drawer at work for unexpected days when you just can't get out, or possibly to take camping, or just for having a few around the house for emergencies, but it's definitely not something I would (or let my family) eat regularly.

review/summary: New Design for the Bowls: FYI
review/text: This review is specifically geared towards the new Nong Shim bowl design...<br /><br />I live in MA, and my local Shaw's only stocks the new plastic bowls of Nong Shim now, no longer the Styrofoam kind, most people are used to.<br /><br />There are two very different things to consider here.<br /><br />No. 1, the bowls are deeper and hold more volume (i.e. water), meaning they aren't as spicy if you fill it to the top.  If you enjoyed their age-old flavor don't fill the bowl all the way to the top.<br /><br />The second difference is that these bowls no longer insulate, so please be careful after adding boiling water.  WARNING: they are hot.  It's a design flaw in order to make the bowls recyclable/microwavable.<br /><br />The tradeoff is that they can be microwaved now.  The lids are different as well.  They don't have the same lining as before, but create a nice seal if you simply place a spoon over them for the three minutes after adding boiling water.<br /><br />I have yet to microwave a batch--it seems useless if you have a stove, so just be aware of the new design next time you go to enjoy a bowl.

I like that the flavor is in a packet so you can add as much or as little of it as you want. The flavor of them is also good for something that is an instant noodle. I have tried other brands of instant noodles and they just don't have the taste that these do. Most other ones are more bland and just not very good. I will continue to buy these noodle bowls to have on occasion when I need something quick and easy.

review/text: Nong Shim's Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl offers up a quick, Ramen-style noodle dish that comes in a one-serving bowl.  Like Cup-A-Noodle and other Ramen-type meals, this is basically a fast, reasonably tasty meal for people who are working at the office or just want something really quick at home.  Just open the lid halfway, fill with water to the internal line, throw in the seasonings from the enclosed packet, nuke it for few minutes and enjoy.<br /><br />As far as taste is concerned, Nong Shim has done nothing to separate itself from the noodle pack.  If you've had spicy chicken flavored noodles from other companies, you've pretty much had Nong Shim's version of the dish.<br /><br />I like eating noodles in this fashion whenever I'm by myself at home and can't decide what to eat for lunch.  They are quick, taste good enough, and basically prevent me from eating a bunch of junk food.<br /><br />I recommend Nong Shim's Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl to anyone who's tied down at work or just hungry for something fast.

review/summary: Spicy Noodles That Bite Back.  :)
review/text: These 'ramen-like' noodles will be a tasty addition to anyone's lunch repertoire - providing of course you have a microwave handy at the office\shop.  The 'Spicy Chicken Flavor' lives up to it's name.  These noodles bite back!  :)  ((But nothing too bad))  I have a love of all things spicy -- but I found these to be somewhere in the low to middle range of heat\spice.  Each bowl contains 2 servings - bringing the total calorie count to 380 per bowl (Total Fat = 7g, Cholesterol = 0mg, Sodium = 890mg, Total Carb = 28g, Protein = 4g).  The package is used as the bowl.  You peel back the lid, and add room temperature water to the easily seen line - then microwave for 3 min.  Or you add hot water and wait 3 minutes.  There were a few small chunks of chicken - ideally I would want more.  The packaging indicates it has 30% less sodium - but at 890mg of sodium I would hate to see that extra 30% back.

review/text: Actually pretty good, lots of noodles, good quality.  I like the noodles in the cup version [Hot and Spicy] a little better, they're more flavorful, but these were very good too.  I only put in about 1/3rd of the soup base packet, I do not like over spiced soups, and it was fine to me.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend the same company's soup cup, vs this bowl.  Easier to eat at work.  When I was carrying this bowl from the kitchen area back to my desk, I spilled a little on my palm, since it's harder to control than the cup.

review/text: I love instant noodles! Some haughty foodies are prejudiced against them because they are "cheap eats", but, even<br />if I were a millionaire, I'd still eat instant noodles. Nong Shim is currently my favorite brand by far, and their<br />products are several steps above ordinary instant ramen. The Spicy Chicken Flavor Bowl Noodle reviewed here is of<br />the microwavable quick-lunch variety, though I generally stick to Nong Shim's stovetop line.<br /><br />One issue with these noodle bowls is that some broth inevitably ends up on the turntable while cooking; some<br />plastic wrap on top should solve that problem. These noodles are more like standard ramen, and have a chewy<br />consistency. The broth is flavorful and pretty spicy for most people, though it seemed relatively tame to<br />this old chile dog's taste buds. Small chunks of chicken and vegetables are scattered throughout, and, as is<br />usual for Nong Shim, some rather exotic ingredients are present as well. A disclaimer on the package mentions<br />"sand lance", which is presumably some sea creature used in Korean cuisine...I'll readily admit to having no idea.<br />I ought to mention that, in true Asian tradition, the noodles here are long and slurpable. If you can't bring<br />youself to slurp, you're advised to break the noodles up before cooking.<br /><br />The Spicy Chicken Flavor Bowl Noodle gives you just enough for a satisfying quick lunch. Nong Shim's stovetop<br />noodle packs are a better deal- I'm nuts about Chapagetti and Shin Ramyun- but the Noodle Bowls would be more<br />suitable to take to work in lieu of brown-bagging or relying on vending machines. Try them if you're a noodle fan.

review/summary: Tastes a lot like ramen to me
review/text: First off, as of this writing, this product is not actually for sale on this page. But it is for sale here: [...]<br /><br />Just had a bowl of these for lunch. I'm not a huge eater, and found the volume of this to be okay. I'm glad I brought some corn chips to supplement (I know, not the best combo). The taste was okay too, though not, in my mind, much better than most ramen or Cup o Noodles or Maruchan type things. Really, it was like a squirt of sriracha in a cup of chicken ramen. Which is fine. Good. And this doesn't have MSG, so that's nice, and it comes in a bowl, so that's nice. There are flakes of veggies, and a couple pea-sized chunks of very spongy chicken. It took me a while to realize that the spongy stuff was chicken. Seems about right for this kind of product.<br /><br />I can't leave the office for lunch, so I'm always looking for something I can tuck in a desk drawer and actually enjoy. Given that it is in a microwaveable (non-styrofoam) bowl, and I like the idea of squirting sriracha in my ramen, this is a good option. Given how infrequently I'll use them, though, I might splurge and go for a much more expensive but slightly more gourmet bowl of noodles (Annie Chun, etc). On the other hand, if I were going to eat them more frequently, I might want to splurge and go for a more expensive but healthier alternative.<br /><br />If cheap, easy, and basically tasty are your priorities, this is probably a good option. If you want to throw healthy or interesting into the mix, I think you're going to have to spend a little more.

review/summary: Nong Shim Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl, 3.03-Ounce (Pack of 12)
review/text: Simple to make and delicious. Noodles are a little thin for my taste, I would like a heartier noodle. Please stop complaining about high sodium, of course its high as with most. I use half the pack of seasoning and a shot or two of tabasco sauce and a small sprinle of black pepper. Good to<br />go.<br /><br />Makes a quick meal with added meat (chicken breast chunks or whatever your taste is)

review/summary: Extremely mild, good spice level for kids
review/text: Got the Spicy Chicken from the grocery store. It was sitting right there, buried by Top Ramen and Maruchan. I wanted the Shin Noodle but was not there. The positive notes about this noodle bowl; Not too salty and the broth is worth drinking at the end. Cons; The noodles aren't that different from those other brands. For more then 3x the price, i was expecting better noodles. Also it's really not that spicy. Extremely mild, good spice level for kids.

review/summary: A Quick And Easy Lunch, With A Few Additions.
review/text: This afternoon I had a Nongshim Bowl Noodle Soup of the Spicy Chicken variety. It's a quick lunch (four minutes) and quite tasty. My only gripes would be that it's too high in sodium, a complaint shared by almost all noodle bowls, and that it doesn't have enough protein for a good meal. I can easily add the latter. I also had a big Delicious Apple to supply something fresh and something with a lot of fiber. Altogether, the combination made a good lunch, and it was quick and easy.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Lacks flavor
review/text: I've been a fan of Nong Shim spicy noodles for years, so when this instant version came along I had to try it. I love Korean style fat noodles and the fact that it's instant is a big plus. Unfortunately, it didn't taste as flavorful as their other lines and by comparison I find this version a little plain. No comments on the health factor since instant noodles by nature is junk food. But there's a time and place for them.

review/summary: Happily fed one of the kids one evening
review/text: "Nong Shim Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl" was another Amazon Vine sample that one of the kids snatched up and ate before I could properly review it.  So you'll have to be happy with this second-hand report.  Anyway, my daughter was the one who grabbed this particular product up (as opposed to my son, who nabbed the "Chips Ahoy!" cookies).  Not a girl of many words (at least not with the parents, generally) she said that she microwaved it, and that it was delicious.  I did manage to pry out of her that she had no special difficulty in preparing it ("it was easy!").  So there you have it-- if our frequently picky daughter enjoyed this, it must be at least pretty good, right?

It's such an easy quick convenient food to stock up for them for whenever they drop in to visit me and I haven't nothing but "white people" food lying around.  But I'm sure that it'll go a long way toward feeding the starving college student types as well.  I think that it's a perfect combination of flavor for price.  But I have to admit that I would not purchase this item at Amazon as it is far more affordable if you buy from an Asian grocery.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, please let me know.

review/text: I had this for lunch and I enjoyed the flavor and the spice level.  It was a little salty for my taste, but not too bad.  Some people suggest not to use the whole flavor packet to reduce the saltiness, but that would also reduce the amount of heat.  The bowl was easy to prepare and it was enough for me for lunch.  Given the hagh salt content and low nutritional value, I would eat this occasionally, not often, to satisfy a craving.

review/summary: Tasted Really Good, But There Were A Couple of Issues
review/text: This is a dried noodle soup that you put the seasoning in the noodles then either put water in it and microwave for three minutes or pour boiling water over it and wait for a few moments.<br /><br />The flavor was spicy chicken and I admit that I felt a little of the warmth from the spices, but didn't really taste the chicken flavor. I did like that there was green onions in with the seasoning. This was better than the usual peas and carrots that are on the top of a Cup O Noodles.<br /><br />I didn't like the bowl that the soup came in. When it had hot water in it, it became really flimsy. I was afraid that the edge was going to cave in and I would get burned from the hot water.<br /><br />In the end, this was basically a Cup O Noodles soup. It tasted just like a Cup O Noodles except that they seasoning package was separate and you had to pour that into the soup before messing with water.<br /><br />At the moment, Amazon does not have a price listed for these so I don't know how cost effective they would be. In my opinion, I would say that the noodle soup was good and filling but take a look at the Cup O Noodles selection before deciding if you really need to order the soup from Amazon.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.

review/summary: OK, for what it is
review/text: Ramen cups (or bowls, in this case) are a guilty pleasure. I enjoy a Nissin or a Maruchan from time to time, but I know before adding the water that I'm not going to get a healthful snack. For that reason, I don't assess any star penalty for the nutritional transgressions that will be committed when one of these is consumed. They are what they are. You want healthy, eat a salad.<br /><br />Speaking of healthy, the Nongshim bowl proudly proclaims that it has 30% less sodium than their regular product and no MSG. But if you eat the whole thing you'll still be getting about 3/4 of your daily allotment of sodium (assuming a 2000 calorie diet) as well as artificial flavor and the usual cast of chemical names. As I mentioned, you would assume this much unless you just fell off a potato truck.<br /><br />All that said, I just didn't care for the Nongshim very much. I like spicy but I didn't find it all that flavorful beyond the spice heat. My 3-star rating is based solely on that. If sodium and healthy eating are concerns, you can work your way down the star scale from there.

review/summary: Full flavored broth, nicely spicy
review/text: I used the full packet of seasoning mix and I though the broth had much more depth of flavor than most noodle cup type meals with distinguishable notes of lemongrass and ginger. I would rate the heat level at medium with a pleasant tingly mouth burn. Less salty but still plenty of sodium, there is plenty of broth so this would be a good one to use as a base with added vegetables and meat. Weak points are the dehydrated chicken and vegetables that have a distinctive dehydrated flavor.

review/summary: Not Bad At All
review/text: I am usually not big into ramen noodles, especially the one's with extra veggies or sides. I always get the chicken and nothing else. I decided to try this one because of the Chef's Best stamp. I tried this and i must say it wasn't bad at all. I didn't realize it would have real chicken bits in it, carrot, and other veggies. The taste was good, i did add a little tony's seasoning salt (that's just me i add it to almost everything). Overall i was surprised, but in a good way. It was quick, the directions simple and easy, was a huge serving, i couldn't finish it all, and was just as good as the ramen noodles chicken that i usually eat, if not better.

review/summary: Brown Bag Treat!
review/text: I love pork noodles at the Chinese restaurant, now they are getting hard to find on the menu.  I was having a cup of noodles on rare occasion to satisfy my noodle urges, they are not too satisfying.  Just tried a bowl of the Nong Shim Spicy Chicken, must say they are a major improvement over the ones that I have previously bought.  These actually have flavor and are quite satisfying.  The serving size is generous and is plenty for a quick lunch.  At about a dollar a bowl, a very reasonable meal.  Compared to the ones that I have had in a restaurant, fresh would naturally be my preference.  I can say that I do like these and I will purchase more.  Great item to have in reserve for lunch at work and when you just don't feel like cooking.

review/summary: Easy meal
review/text: This is a true convenience food - all you need to add is water and wait a few minutes.  There are a couple of options: add cold water and microwave for three minutes, or boil water, and then wait 3 minutes.  I chose the latter because I didn't like the idea of putting the plastic bowl in the microwave.  After three minutes it was ready - very easy.<br /><br />The flavor is "spicy chicken".  Be aware that this is "spicy" in the sense that if all you are used to is ketchup, you might notice a tiny bite to this.  If you are used to truly spicy food.....this isn't spicy at all.  I could barely tell there was anything at all that is spicy to the flavoring.<br /><br />One thing I did add to round it out is an egg - it made it sort of like egg drop soup and added a little nutrition to the meal.  It would be fine without this addition but was extra delicious with it.

review/summary: Spicy Ramen Noodles
review/text: These are just ramen noodles in a convenient microwavable cup. Noodles, a smattering of dried veggies and TVP, and a salt...I mean flavor packet. Prep is stupid easy...open the foil lid, add the contents of the flavor packet, add water to the line, fold the lid back down, nuke for three minutes, stir, and enjoy.<br /><br />The results are just what you would expect from a bowl of ramen. Lots of noodles and broth, and there at the bottom of the bowl, are a few vegetable bits and some tiny cubes of textured soy protein that is supposed to pass for chicken. The flavor is just about what you would expect from a chicken flavored soup, but with a nice spicy kick on the back of the throat. That spiciness stays pleasantly on the lips for a few minutes after.<br /><br />So what's not to like? Even if you aren't watching your sodium intake, this is a salt lick in a bowl. Even if you follow the "serving guidelines" on the nutrition facts panel and share this with a friend or loved one (Yeah, right!), you get over one third of your daily salt intake. If you are like most of us and hog all 3 oz. yourself, your sodium intake will be a whopping 74% of the daily recommended maximum.<br /><br />The price is also a bit steep for a ramen product. Overall it is not enough new and different from the ramen in the cello wrap for me to purchase this.

review/summary: A small step up from the usual cup o' noodles
review/text: I've been eating Nong Shim's noodles for years -- I particularly like eating their Spicy Seafood udon-style noodles (not 'instant' stuff like this).  Their products usually deliver on lots of flavor and a decent textured noodles.  This Spicy Chicken flavor bowl of noodle soup would be the first instant variety of their noodles I've tried.<br /><br />The quality/texture of the noodles is similar to that of the Nissin brand noodles (better than Maruchan).  What sets this apart is the soup base flavor pack which delivers a more complex flavor and IMO tastes much better by comparison.  Since they give you the soup base pack, it gives you the option to add as much or as little flavoring as you'd like (whereas Cup O' Noodles, you're usually stuck with however much they give you).  It has the usual dehydrated veggies.  Other reviewers mention that there are little chunks of chicken... Reading the ingredients, I don't see a single mention of chicken besides chicken broth.<br /><br />Whereas the typical Cup o' Noodle will deliver 2.25-oz of unhealthy goodness, these bowls of noodle delivers 3.03oz.  The bowl of noodles wasn't that filling -- it'd be a perfect sized snack.  I don't know how they would conclude that this bowl would be equivalent to 2 servings.  The bowl delivers 380 calories (120 from fat), 14g of fat, 6g of saturated fat, 1780 mg of sodium, 56g of carbs, 2g of dietary fiber, and upwards of 2g of sugar, and 8g of protein.<br /><br />On the packaging, it seems NongShim is trying to sell you on the product being healthy.  It touts "No MSG added," "30% less sodium than our regular product," "0g trans fat."  It has received some "2011 Chef's Best Award" and is "Endorsed by Professional Chefs."  Really?<br /><br />If you're buying this, don't expect this to be your answer to a healthy diet.  That said, if all you want is a quick and tasty snack, then NongShim will deliver what you're looking for.

review/summary: Tasty, but the picture is misleading
review/text: This cup-o-noodles knock off is fine tasting. It is not as aggressively hot as some Korean foods. I would call it mild to medium-minus in the spiciness arena. It has instructions for both microwave and "Add boiling water" methods of preparation. The one reason I would take off a star is that the picture on the top implies wholesome chunks of chicken and veggies. What you get are noodles that look like the noodles. Broth looks similar, too. The meat and veggie particles are tiny, 6mm chunks. You really won't have to sharpen the teeth for this stuff because the meat is so small.<br /><br />I am sure that there is some fine print saying it's a serving suggestion and you should add your chunks of meat and vegetables, but given that, they should have just not attempted to put the tiny freeze dried pellets in there. One of those things that highlights the issue.

review/text: Sure, it's unhealthy, but if you are expecting to eat Ramen you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I rarely eat these noodle bowls, but when I ate this one I was pleasantly surprised by the spiciness of the broth.  You usually never get that --you know, where they say 'spicy' but it really is just spicy to middle America, not those used to eating Thai or Indian food.<br /><br />In this case, it is just spicy enough.  You start to sweat a tiny bit, but it doesn't burn your mouth.<br /><br />Would I buy this regularly? Probably not, it isn't healthy enough, but would I buy one or two of these to stick in my office cabinet in case I have to work late and haven't made alternate dinner plans? Sure I would.<br /><br />Tasty enough, no Msg, lower sodium (probably because it has the added spiciness to counteract) and a good enough taste.

The products were old and unusable. I am very disappointed with this vendor and will purchase my colorants from another more reliable source. Americolor is good TCP is not.

review/summary: Love it
review/text: It is a little on the sweet side but does not taste like a strong vodka.  I usually enjoy it as a dessert drink. It is still a good strong vodka but the sweet flavor kills the alcohol taste resulting in a very smooth drink.  I usually mix it with a little bit of ice water and it is perfect!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This stuff is great.  It will mess you up and it tastes great.  What me and my friends like to do is combine this vodka with root beer, it tastes just like a root beer float.  Or orange soda, which makes it taste like creamsicle.  It's kind of expensive compared to other vodkas.  But if you like sweets like me and want to get a little drunk...then try this vodka.

review/summary: Convenient, tasty, organic
review/text: I love this spice mix because it's organic and makes such an easy meal. I don't follow the directions because of food sensitivities, but my way is awesome, too. I start steaming broccoli &/or cauliflower with green beans and corn, then add one can of organic coconut milk midway through (to help cut the spiciness and add creaminess). I make quinoa in another pot to eat with it. Brown rice works, too, but quinoa works better for me. Anyway, it tastes great, and it's easy and quick to make, which makes it really convenient.

review/text: Don't just giggle at the can- open it and eat it!<br />There is nothing more wonderful than Spotted Dick with lashings of custard and a good cup of strong tea with friends. YUM! I keep it in the cupboard and am ready for friends and tea at a moment's notice. This is a rich sponge cake with currents and savory rich tones of brown sugar. The chocolate and sticky Toffee and Treacle are all good too - when you can get them.<br /><br />I know the name seems a bit naughty--it just adds to the fun of offering some cultural engagement to our wonderful world. I do slip it into gifts and offer to bring dessert to friends. BUT I also love this line of products for the QUALITY!

review/summary: What's so Funny?
review/text: British food is often poorly regarded by comparison to the cuisine of our European neighbours: France, Italy, Germany and Spain. Yet in some areas Britain truly leads the world - where would we be without the sandwich, for example?<br /><br />Another area of British culinary pre-eminence is the steamed pudding, amongst which the Spotted Dick is king. As a pudding-fan, I am deeply saddened that several, rather puerile, reviewers find this name mildly amusing. I doubt they would stoop to such pathetic attempts at humour if they had bothered to taste it first.<br /><br />Take my word for it: nothing tastes better than a mouthful of dick, especially if it comes with a load of hot custard.

review/text: Not a pudding by American standards.  But then again, the name itself is somewhat obscene by American standards.  I found this treat very very sweet, and it has been a long long time since I have seen bread in a can. It tasted much better heating in the microwave and then pouring some cream or half and half on top.<br /><br />I give this out as a gift for Christmas and birthdays, and almost everyone loves it!!!  But don't give it to anyone at work or where there is an HR department - I learned the hard way.

review/summary: Not the real thing, but quite good
review/text: There are at least two known breeds of Spotted Dick (or Spotted Dog, as it was once called).  The one that was a staple of my childhood (English working class) diet is a steamed suet pudding.  It is made from suet, flour, sugar, currants and raisins, and is usually served with treacle.<br /><br />The Heinz canned version is a very different animal, a member of the sponge pudding race, containing no suet.  It is nice enough, and is especially good with English-style custard.  It is tasty, filling and easy to prepare, and its name makes it great fun.<br /><br />But if you are a fan of the Aubrey/Maturin stories and want to eat like them, be warned that this is not the real thing.  The genuine Spotted Dick (or Dog), described in O'Brian's books, is the glorious suet pudding of my youth.<br />[PeterReeve]

review/summary: My girlfriend likes it
review/text: With British food's reputation for tasting like recycled garbage, and a dubious name at best, Spotted Dick sounds more like leftovers from the Saw movies than anything edible.  Nonetheless, I gave some to my girlfriend...and she also ate Spotted Dick.<br /><br />This soggy bread in a can is delightful.  Straying from the typical rubbage on British plates, the injection of flavor from Spotted Dick is a welcome taste.  A sweet treat with hints of cinnamon, this is perfect for a party filled with Dick hungry guests.<br /><br />At ten ounces, each can is roughly four servings based upon the nutritional facts.  That's roughly 1000 calories with about 360 of them fat calories for a total of 40 grams of fat.  To say that this Dick is fat would be an understatement.  With trace amounts of calcium and iron - or so the rumors go - there are some healthy benefits to this charming confection.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: This pudding is delicious and I guess because I grew up in England and didn't emigrate to the US until 1964, I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about regarding Dick; it must be the spotted part that made people so silly.  The name was changed in 2001 to Spotted Richard because, apparently, some women were embarrassed to ask for this when shopping.  However, after the name change, the product sat on the store shelves.  No one was buying Richard; too bloody boring.  Heinz realized it had made a mistake so changed the name back to Spotted Dick and the rest is history.

review/summary: I've had better....It was a bit short on flavor
review/text: I am not a fan of raisins, fruitcake or any of that stuff but I just had to know what Spotted Dick tastes like so I bought one. It wasn't as bad as the name or the picture on the package would suggest...but it wasn't exactly great dick either. I could see this going well with tea or a strong alcoholic beverage. Overall this dick wasn't particularly good or bad but it isn't something I will be rushing to eat again. It's a bland, spongy cake with fruit in it and it didn't taste particularly bad or good.<br /><br />The can is good for a laugh if you are a slightly (ME!) immature American! I am sure some American words and names are quite funny in England too. Whatever the case may be, if you are feeling randy go grab yourself a can of Heinz Spotted Dick. If you are into Spotted Dick you may find this stuff very satisfying!

review/summary: Quite Good. Much Too High In Calories.
review/text: I was in a local grocery store that has a lot of items imported from England when I saw cans of Heinz Spotted Dick Pudding. Well, I'd heard of it. Hasn't everyone? The name sounds more like a medical condition than a type of foodstuff and it must lend itself to a certain middle-school-level humor, not necessarily limited to those of that particular age. In any case, I had about a half can (too much) after lunch. I heated it up in the microwave and, after heating, coated it with a veneer of Devon custard. The combination was quite good. It's much too high in calories (from fats and sugars), of course, so I'll have to watch my consumption. However, it was an interesting treat and now when I hear the snickers, I'll understand a bit better.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Tastes like wet fruitcake to me
review/text: Very odd product.  Can says No GM ingredients (Genetically Modified?) but the ingredients include partially hydrogenated canola and palm oils.  Yucky source of transfats so be aware that thsi imported product contains 2g trans fat per serving...and each can has 3.5 servings.<br /><br />Taste wise - in my opinion, tastes like soggy, wet fruitcake (not in any good way at all).  WAY TOO SWEET and I even got a few bites with a sandy, gritty, crunch texture which was horrible and I can only hope it was from the raisins?!<br /><br />This product is not pleasant tasting at all so I am just not sure about all the other great reviews.  But for my taste, I couldn't choke down even a few bites of this stuff.  Only thing I appreciated from this was the few laughs from friends/family over the name of this Heinz product.
