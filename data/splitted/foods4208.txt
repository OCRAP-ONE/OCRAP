review/summary: MMMMmmmm GOOD!!! SUBLIME COFFEE- BEST EVER~
review/text: I have bought this coffee two times and it is wonderful! Dark roast similar to French Roast. I don't particularly care for espresso burnt bitter. This is a dark roast that is robust, smooth and very flavorful. I also store in freezer and decant into airtight containers that I use during the week. Good to store coffee beans in freezer for 3-4 weeks, but bring to room temp for grinding or oils are heavy.

review/summary: A wonderful, rich coffee
review/text: This is by far the best bean in town.  Before I left the states I was drinking Trader Joe's French Roast which I really enjoyed.  Fogbuster takes it up a notch.  The coffee is strong, rich and has a great depth of flavor.  I highly recommend this to those who enjoy a strong cup of coffee with a good flavor.

review/summary: These beans were not fresh.
review/text: It's hard to tell if this is a truly good coffee. It very may well be when the beans are fresh. As soon as I opened the bag there was that vague smell, almost musty and definitely stale. I made a pot anyway. (I'm cheap that way.) Honestly, the stale smell is not evident after brewing but this is a mediocre coffee at best. Maybe it would be better if the beans had been fresh, maybe not. The flavor is almost rich, almost dark, almost really good. It just somehow misses the mark. The beans themselves were, aside from the smell, decent; uniform, a good color and firm. I've had much better coffee and I've had much worse.

review/summary: Excellent coffee!
review/text: Despite its name, don't expect this to be the darkest, strongest coffee you've ever had--unless you're switching from Folger's, or Gloria Jean's, or even Lavazza or whatever. The Fogbuster is a nice, dark roast that doesn't cross over into a French or espresso roast. For the past few years, our everyday coffee has been Longbottom (a local Portland roaster) Black Gold blend. The Fogbuster is milder, my wife prefers it, so it is going into a regular rotation with the Black Gold (which I recommend you coffee lovers might want to Google). I like it, too, the price is outstanding, and the five-pound bag is convenient. I'll also mention that we like Italia D'Oro from Boyd's, because along with our fondness for Longbottom, that might serve to give you some points of flavor reference. (Wouldn't it be great for Amazon to publish a chart showing that people who like coffee A also tend to like X, Y and Z?) Last thing, this coffee came in a bag just like the picture, not a clear bag as some have mentioned, and there were no issues with the way it was packed or sealed.

review/summary: MUCH better than supermarket beans!
review/text: When the local MegaMart stopped carrying two pound bags of the beans I'd been buying for years, I was outraged and started shopping around.  I found Jeremiah's here on Amazon and ordered this five pound bag.  It was a tad more expensive than equivalent supermarket beans, but hey, it's delivered to my door.<br /><br />Oh, happy day!<br /><br />The beans even LOOK better--oily, almost black and powerfully fragrant--and make the best coffee we've ever had at home.  It's just this side of bitter (a good thing), one sip of this and you know you're drinking Serious Coffee.  I do agree with the reviewer who said to grind Fogbuster more coarsely than usual.  For some reason it makes a big difference in flavor.<br /><br />I signed up for six month delivery, and since no way will five pounds last us that long, I'm going to try the Kona next.<br /><br />Thank you MegaMart!

review/summary: Weaker brew
review/text: The beans are oily with the appearance of an italian espresso bean. The brew, with a french press, is a rather flat, average coffee. Don't know whether its arabica or robusta or both. It lacks personality. I don't feel a kick of caffeine, either. I am neither here or there with this one. I know coffee because I worked at a gourmet coffee house well before Starbucks came along. This is just okay, not great.

review/text: My friend Don gifted me with a bag of Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Fogbuster whole bean coffee.  I figured that HUGE, 5-pound bag would last me forever.  NOT! Not when I tasted how GOOD was this coffee.  I brewed many a pot and shared beans with family and friends.  Then I bought a bag from Don and kept on drinking and sharing. Now I have my own amazon.com account.<br />This coffee is strong without being bitter; a nice, full-bodied flavor enhanced only by a splash of heavy cream. Mmmmmmm, heavenly!<br />If you DO have some for reheats, put a new filter in the coffeemaker, add a healthy pinch of ground cinnamon, run the leftover coffee through the machine.  Of course, add cream!  Love it!

review/summary: Quite good, though not consistently so.
review/text: I make three or four triple espressos a day with a very good grinder and espresso machine.  I carefully store the beans in vacuum once I get them.<br /><br />Most of the time, these Fogbuster beans I get (from Amazon) are good, even excellent.  This last batch, well, not so good.  Tastes slightly stale.<br /><br />Obviously, it's understandable that there would be slight variations in quality from time to time, but I wonder about the freshness.  Their description says: "We roast our coffee daily. ensuring that the coffee you buy is fresh."<br /><br />Well, you can roast coffee every minute, but if it sits on a shelf in a warehouse, on a truck, or at Amazon for weeks or months, it's not gonna be so fresh when it gets to the drinker.<br /><br />I found no date stamp on the bag, so I can't tell when this batch was roasted.  It would be interesting to know just how recently the beans were roasted.

review/text: I recently ordered the following coffee: Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Fogbuster, Whole Bean, 5-Pound Bag. It arrived promptly, but tastes stale. The package does not look like the colorful one illustrated in the picture. Rather, orders are shipped in clear plastic with no information about the company, and in my case the package was defective. A seam on the side had split open, allowing air to enter, which must have affected the coffee as it tastes stale. Jermiah's, so far, has been a big disappointment.

review/summary: A Nice Everyday Coffee!
review/text: We have been receiving this coffee for about two years now on an Amazon subscription, which is simply a super way to buy coffee.  Every three months, a five pound bag arrives -postage/shipping free- and Amazon applies an additional discount for using their subscription process.  We love this coffee and Amazon's Subscription program too.<br /><br />Followup Review: 01/13/12 - Although the quality of this coffee may still be as nice as it was when I first did my initial review, the price has gone through the roof!  We no longer get this coffee through Amazon's Subscription service - however, we still do get our coffee via this route; it just requires 'shopping' for alternatives each time our current choice rises in price too dramatically, as has this one.  Jeremiah's seems to have fallen victim to the price escalation disease more so than many other coffee sellers, but they all have raised prices, as their own costs have gone up.  Watch your Subscription Service notices of imminent shipping - Amazon is good about this, and they clearly let you know when the price is about to rise, bur what you may not notice is the rise over a year's time, or more!  Shop carefully.

review/text: This tea is a wonderful way to cap off a long walk or day-- providing, of course, you can get the cap off. I recommend a grippy potholder, such as what one uses on a stubborn jar, and patience.<br /><br />Probably just best to locate your nearest store and enjoy your tea fresh.

review/summary: great treats
review/text: These are great treats with healthy (well, healthy as far as treats go) ingredients, and my dog loves them. They're moist, but not sticky or gooey, so you can keep a couple in your pocket with no worries.  They break apart easily, so they're really good for smaller dogs.  The only downside is that if you don't keep them sealed in the bag, they get hard.  The price on amazon is basically the same as you'll find at PetSmart or Petco.

review/summary: Head and shoulders above the rest
review/text: These are excellent treats that I would recommend to almost any dog owner. After purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CI9X4">Bil-Jac Little Jacs Liver Treats</a> while in a rush at the store, and then reading the ingredients list, I knew that I didn't want to purchase anything with additives and low-grade chicken any more! My wife and I picked these up at a pet store and so far we have been quite pleased!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Contains NO chicken by-products*<br />- Contains no wheat**<br />- Perfect size for puppies, small dogs or training<br />- Also available at pet stores<br /><br />CONS<br />- A tad pricey<br />- Give some dogs loose stools***<br /><br />*While this product doesn't contain chicken by-products, don't be fooled into thinking that it contains high-grade chicken. This is definitely better than most dog treats, but it's not on par with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CR41KQ">Newman's Own Organic Chicken Treats</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TL2XN4">Flint River Ranch Dog Treats</a>, that use human-grade meat and poultry.<br /><br />**Some dogs are allergic to wheat. If your dog has allergies or even is beginning to show symptoms, wheat should be the first thing you cut out. Many MANY foods contain it as a filler, and many allergies are traced back to it.<br /><br />***It is important to note that this may mess with a dog who's stomach is used to other food. Swap these with their regular treats slowly to avoid gastrointestinal discomfort!<br /><br />OVERALL<br />These are a little pricey, but you are paying for a healthy, nutritious treat, not some WalMart-grade by-product infused junk. If you care about your dog, you need to feed them with the best food and treats available, and these Chicken Bits are a great place to start!

review/summary: My Pup Absolutely Loves These
review/text: I was turned on to the Blue Buffalo brand by the trainer at the training class I signed me and my pup for.  He is my new little fur ball so I have been very cautious about what he eats and the type of foods that he is exposed to.  I really didn't want to get into the habit of buying cheap foods and treats with random fillers and terrible nutrition, so I was always open to advice from the "experts".  After doing some reading, I realized that Blue Buffalo is indeed one of the best most natural brands of Dog Foods available, so I jumped at the chance at trying these little treats for my in-training pup.  They are great! He absolutely loves them and will literally do anything for them!  He has already learned how to sit, lay, 'dance', 'paw', and stay!  The great thing is that they don't even smell terrible, they actually smell a bit like beef jerky.<br /><br />One thing I do recommend, is that if you have a smaller pup (mine is a shihpoo, 5months, 8lbs) cut these treats in half!  They are perfectly capable of eating them as a whole piece, but you totally get your money's worth by breaking them down in halves ;)

I stopped giving her these treats for a few days and the symptoms disappeared. Then tonight I gave her a couple of these treats again and same thing happened. This time after the loose stool, I think her stomach was still upset and she wanted to go to sleep but kept fidgeting and wimpering. I sat with her rubbing her stomach. Eventually she fell asleep. Well, I'm never buying this brand again.

They aren't hard and tough like most gummy bears and have more of a consistency of fruit snacks. I recommend getting these. You could find them for less than Amazon's price at a health food store.

review/text: This is much better than the regular Twinings breakfast tea.<br />Stronger, great flavor. I have never seen it available in the USA.<br />If you use milk in your breakfast tea the stronger flavor works.<br />I really can not imagine anyone drinking this strong of<br />tea without milk, soy or something added.  (however I'm probably wrong about this)<br />The "strong" idea works well with this English Breakfast Tea.<br />I also drink Green Tea and Quality Black teas without anything added but the water.<br />I previously became tired of English Breakfast,<br />however this 1706 version has me going for it first thing every morning.<br />It seems to be a result of the curing of the tea and not the quantity.  I can add extra-bags<br />of regular English Breakfast and not get the same quality of flavor as with<br />1706. The 1706 might be considered the "espresso version" of English breakfast tea.

review/summary: Dry, hard, and made with cane sugar
review/text: I had tried Jennies individually-wrapped coconut macaroons a couple of years ago and loved them. Unfortunately, these canned almond macaroons are totally different. They're dry and hard, with a totally different texture than I expected. They are edible, but hardly the delicious treats I expected.<br /><br />Jennies also changed the recipe last year. These used to be sweetened entirely with honey, and I learned about Jennies from people following the Specific Carbohydrate Diet. They are now made with evaporated cane juice (meaning sucrose), putting them off-limits to the SCD followers who I know constituted a substantial part of their customer base. As I write this, Amazon still has the old ingredient information. This is my first time trying these canned macaroons, so I don't know if this made a difference in texture or taste.

review/summary: Jennies is ruined by new company
review/text: I have eaten these for years and years and loved them. Jennies was bought out by Red Mill Farms and they moved the manufacturing plant from Brooklyn to Pennsylvania.<br />The macaroons are now inedible. I would get one good can, then 2 bad ones and so on. The bad ones were either burnt or so hard you could drive a nail with them.<br />They don't respond to emails-ever. They have a facebook page where I left some comments without a reply. There was one contact email posted by a former Jennies employee-she says she still gets email from people complaining about the poor quality and the addition of sugar to the recipe. She said she left the company for these reasons.<br />Once again a great product ruined by a takeover. They should have left well enough alone.<br />The question is-who makes quality coconut macaroons that we could switch to? Good coconut is healthy but most out there is sulfited poor quality coconut.

review/summary: I actually sought out this seller again because of the results I had with first purchase
review/text: I tracked down my invoice from a year ago so I could find this seller again, and when I found them was surprised to see the negative reviews. I bought 25 lbs in Sept. 2010 and due to personal circumstances was not able to start growing any wheatgrass until this summer. I just did two trays, with 2 cups of seed per tray, soaked and then germinated for 3 days in the dark. I had good thick trays of grass, and most importantly it was so deliciously sweet!  This was my first time growing wheat grass and it smelled so strong and bitter when I juiced it-- I was concerned, thinking it would taste awful. But it was so sweet to the taste. I was later told by an old pro that some say the sweetness is due to the seed, which brings me back to why I sought out this seller again. Obviously, I can't be guaranteed that the next 25 lbs will be equally sweet since it's a year later and likely a different harvest, but I hope so!

review/summary: Diabetic who loves Dreamfields.
review/text: Who better than a diabetic to vouch for this product? Unlike most low-carbohydrate dieters, I test my blood sugar at least four times a day. I know how foods affect me. I have very tight control on my blood sugar; my readings are very predictable. Because of that, I know when foods have hidden carbohydrates in them.<br /><br />I experimented last year with Dreamfields. I paired one serving size of the spaghetti with an olive oil and garlic sauce and topped the dish with some Parmesan cheese. Because some diabetics complain of delayed spikes, I tested every hour for four hours just to make sure. Pre-meal: 69; 1 Hour: 62; 2 Hour: 73; 3 Hour: 82; 4 Hour: 69. As you can see, I returned to pre-meal levels by four hours and my third-hour reading was the highest, but the number wasn't high in itself. I have since eaten Dreamfields on two other occasions with similar results.<br /><br />I think the key is restricting your portion size to that listed on the box. Cook al dente, as overcooking can weaken the protective coating that blocks the carbohydrates. Be mindful of the sauces you're using. Jarred tomato sauce is just full of sugar. I buy a jarred Alfredo that only has 1 gram of carbohydrates per serving. Pesto and olive-oil sauces are good options, too. Add a protein to your dish; that helps.<br /><br />As far as taste goes: amazing. Tastes exactly like real pasta. No one in my family knew that it wasn't the 'real' stuff. I love that Dreamfields makes more than just spaghetti. I actually got to enjoy macaroni salad at my last family gathering thanks to Dreamfields.

review/summary: Low-carb pasta that tastes like PASTA!
review/text: It is almost too good to be true, but the stix (Atkins followers will know what I mean) don't lie:  Dreamfields pasta won't mess with your low-carbing (or your lipolysis).<br /><br />I've low-carbed for the better part of 9 years, and this is one of the few low-carb products that not only delivers, it does so without any concessions.  The taste & texture are spot-on, and the non-dieters in your family won't raise an eyebrow.  Of course, keep it in moderation, but do give it a try.

review/summary: We love it!
review/text: We love Dreamfields pasta. I agree with other reveiws that one must pay attention to the serving size.  For instance, the box of angel hair pasta is NOT a 16 oz box as one might be accustomed to using, it is 13.25 oz. and one box has 6.5 servings,or approximately 2 oz. of dry pasta per suggested serving.  So one must be aware of how much pasta is on the plate!  If you want to know just how Dreamfields works, do some research on the web.  I always like to find articles that do not come directly from the manufacturer so I know they are not actually marketing materials.  There are such articles about this pasta from various sources.  I believe that it takes about 45 carbs to spike insulin, so do be careful about the sauce.  A large serving of the pasta and a high-sugar sauce difinitely defeats the purpose.  We cook ours 4 minutes and enjoy it regularly for a great tasting pasta.  And in my family's opinion, it taste much better tasting than the whole wheat pastas available.

I found that you can also buy it from [...].  It's cheaper and they only charge [...]shipping no matter how much you buy. I'm going to use the Amazon wishlist button the next time I order it.  I did give me some gas later on.  I read somewhere that means the food it getting digested in your colon and not in your intestine.  I assume means the carbs are not getting asorbed and that is why this pasta is low net carb.  I definitely plan to buy more Dreamfield pasta.

review/summary: Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/summary: Dreamfields Pasta Tastes Just as Good as Regular Pasta!
review/text: I bought Dreamfields Pasta because I had started the Atkins low carb diet, and after a few weeks, I began to get the urge to eat pasta again.<br /><br />I was amazed that when I ate Dreamfields Pasta, which I bought in several different styles, like linguine and rotini, that it tastes just as good as regular pasta. And each two ounce serving is only 5 net grams of carbs. Spread some red or white sauce on top, add a couple of low carb meatballs, made without breadcrumbs, and you have a great Italian dinner, without the guilt.

review/text: My wife and I ate the recommended serving (2 oz dried). It was delicious, and we felt full afterwards. Later that night, neither of us slept well because we were so hungry. I don't know if this is related, but we both had heart palpitations that night.<br /><br />We both woke up feeling starved. I usually don't even feel hungry in the morning! My wife checked her blood sugar levels (she has gestational diabetes) and found they had skyrocketed.<br /><br />This is not a low-carb product, it is a high-carb product where the carbs have been altered in a way that affects absorption - but not necessarily to truly lower its glycemic impact.<br /><br />If it works for you, great, but it REALLY did not work for us. We're throwing out all the boxes that I bought based on the 5 star ratings here. If you want to try it, start with a single box and see how it makes you feel.

review/summary: Not Low Carb
review/text: This is the best example of buyer beware. The glucose rise happens 3-4 hrs after. Do not listen to the hype about cooking in acidic tomato sauce. Your stomach uses hydrochloric acid. A heck of a lot stronger than that in tomatoes. If you need to watch your blood glucose watch out and check at hr 3 and 4 and you will be shocked. No differece than regular pasta. The 5 grams of real fiber (inulin) just causes a delay in the high rise. Metamucill makes an easy dissolving fiber with inulin. Take it right before normal pasta ingestion and you have the same affect.

review/summary: Do the math yourself and see.
review/text: Check the ones who have listed five stars for Dreamfields vs those who have graded it down and you will see that Dreamfields is the real deal. I have been diabetic for twenty years and had to take pastas out of my diet...until I discovered Dreamfields a few years ago. I use insulin and pills to control my blood sugar and know what will spike my sugar levels. Dreamfields properly cooked has never once sent me to the insulin syringe for spiked blood sugar levels. I do not know what others may have done that caused their levels to spike. Maybe they over-cooked it, or used some ingredients that have sugars in them that they forgot to check.<br /><br />I am happy to say both my wife (also a diabetic) and I can now eat pastas again. We tried to eat whole wheat pastas, but they were no better than regular pastas for blood sugar levels. And they just don't taste as good! I am not concerned about the "nutritional values" of pastas. I just don't look to pasta to provide certain nutritives. I eat a well balanced diet and get what I need from homemade home-ground whole wheat, grains, vegetables and fruits. So, if Dreamfields somehow falls short of listed claims or expectations, it doesn't bother be in the least.<br /><br />If you don't need to eat lo-carb pastas, don't waste your money on Dreamfields. It is a pasta with a purpose; to offer those who need to control carbs an alternative worth buying. Buy the untreated and save money. But, if you need it, it is a good value for what it does for you. I cannot tell the difference in their flavor or tastes from regular pastas.<br /><br />If you don't like the pricing, consider a competitor brand. Oh, wait! They have no competitors! No one seems to care enough to fill that gap! So there you are!

A light bulb flashed in my head just recently that Amazon might be offering the same low carb products that I've been purchasing over the years from another seller. Thankfully, they offer about half of them that I consumer regularly, and this is one of them. This pasta taste about 80% (90% when you throw in the pasta sauces)just like the real deal, and they come in so many different shapes, so they end up being extremely versatile. Along with Bella Vita sauce (which has no added sugar, has very low carbs and is one of those not offered on this site [you'll have to get from Netrition or some other online retailer], you'll be in heaven; especially if you're a pasta lover like me. Man...do I love pasta. You will not be disappointed with another "meh" low carb product here. I was extremely skeptical at first and thought "this 'aint low carb dude, something's up", but I've eaten a lot before just in order to test it (ahem...yeah, to test, it was) if it would throw me out of ketosis, and was thrilled when it didn't. I stocked up for the upcoming Armageddon. You should to. Happy low carbing!!

If you compare the nutritional facts to that of whole wheat pasta (which is also delicious, and can be bought anywhere) the whole wheat pasta is actually BETTER for you. Dreamfields packaging states that there are "protected carbohydrates", but never explain this concept. By which standards are they measuring these "protected carbohydrates"?? I say this is a great alternative to regular pasta, but it's not exactly what it claims to be - it's still pretty high on the glycemic index.
