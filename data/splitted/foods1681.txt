I am trying to keep food portions small and love meals that I can keep in my purse or car or desk so I am not tempted to stop at fast food places.  This totally fits the bill!  Am ordering more....

review/text: Very , very good product !  I love mushrooms anyway , but this and maybe a tiny bit of sea salt on most any meal dish is just great ....  Good in cooking too !  The only suggestion to the company would be to incorporate this<br />Mushroom idea into a small " Grinder" like they have for Pepper ...  Kevin Garder

review/summary: Very good product--too finely ground
review/text: This is a very good product, but I find myself inhaling before flipping open the cap, holding my breath and then exhaling as I sprinkle it on, and turning a few feet away once I'm done, so I can inhale again. When grinding or milling the mushrooms it was not necessary to take things down to the subatomic particle level. Seriously, teensy, almost lighter than air flakes wafting up to invade the nose producing a tickle I would have wanted had I ordered snuff. But, again, overall very good product.

review/text: German holiday cookies are different from those in US. Less sweet, with a unique flavor. I fell in love with them, and this is the best brand they make. Sometimes hard to get here, but worth searching for. They use the same dough, but some are glazed in chocolate, or clear sugar type glaze. Try the assortment.

review/summary: The tea
review/text: I was pretty startled by the HUGE bag full of leaf.I actually though the bag was an outside package because it was so friggin big.But nope,it was all leaf.One steep will only win you a weak single cup of tea.Unfortunately,I like a strong mint taste,more like my peppermint teas.Not sure if the product is just not fresh or if this is the norm as its my first taste of real spearmint.Ill probably just use a peppermint tea bag along with it.Mildly sweet with a very pungent finish,steeps pale.Very nice strong,pleasant aroma of course and it delighted me to get wiffs from my pocketbook all day.I think it would make a great freshener by adding it to a satchel,like they use in drawers or closets.This bag will literally last forever.You could make hundreds of cups of tea.Smells just like wrigleys gum.<br />I bought it after reading official research on spearmint and its horomone regulating properties.This looks very promising for women suffering from menopausal syptoms,PCOS(and hirsuitism),etc.

review/text: This product is wonderful! Extremely fresh, great taste and awesome smell!<br />This is a lot of spearmint... so its a good idea to subdivide when you open it to maintain freshness.<br />I think that you will enjoy this spearmint.  If you are going to use this for tea, check your water temperature before your steep the leaves.  When spearmint is steeped water not hot enough, it doesn't get the complete flavor. Use water just reaching a boil.

He does enjoy these.  After coming in from doing his business outside, he runs right to counter waiting for one.  Obviously he likes them.  Hopefully they'll last thru his puppy stage and then I'll move onto the bigger ones.  Nice small size for a puppy also.

review/text: I am watchng my weight so I added eight cups of water and an additional two cups of chicken broth.  For my husband's servings, I added kernel corn and diced chicken.  This soup is totally YUMMY!  It's very filling so one cup at less than 150 calories is a good lead-in for the balance of the meal, and helps you to eat less overall.  And, the soup is versatile.  You can add pretty much anything - cut up potatoes, various types of vegetables, cooked pasta, egg noodles, Great Northern white or pinto beans, and/or chicken, beef, or pork - and this soup becomes a full meal.  Stock up.  Whatever you buy will not go to waste!

review/summary: A tasty and filling wild rice soup.
review/text: We originally purchased this at a local grocery store that discontinued the product line, so we were happy to find it on Amazon. The soup mix is easy to make and "out of the bag" is tasty, filling, nutritious and not so caloric. You can add or mix other items - chicken chunks are delicious, as are chopped mushroom bits, corn, you name it, and you can add the nutritional content by mixing with mil, chicken stock, etc. But for a nice cold night, I like this warming and tasty soup just as it is, with a mild wild rice flavor coming through. Accompanied perhaps with a piece of dense dark bread and a salad, this is a super supper.

I said I not and they responded that everyone was raving about it.  I now know why.  I first prepared it just by package directions and it was great.  The next time I put a can of condensed mushroom soup with an extra can of water and about 1/2 package of cream cheese and it was even better.  My husband, who is not a big soup fan, asks for it all the time.  My guests are going to be so impressed when I present them with this soup sprinkled with a little cheese, chopped green onions and bacon bits.

review/text: ...and instead recommend Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli when I noticed that Bob's product lists a serving size of 1/4 cup while this product lists the serving size as a full cup.  Big difference.  So when all of this is taken into account, the nutritional values are similar, with Bob's Muesli being higher in carbs and fiber and the Mestemacher Muesli being slightly lower in carbs and a bit higher in saturated fat (due to the honey in the Mestemacher product).  Having written this, I think I do prefer Bob's Muesli, but this one is still pretty good.<br /><br />There is a reason that Mestemacher calls its cereal "Honey Crunch Muesli."  That's because honey is the 2nd major ingredient.  And when you eat this cereal, indeed you will taste a moderately-strong honey taste.  Whether that's a plus or not depends on how much you like honey.  Personally, I prefer to sweeten my cereal in my own way, but that's just me.<br /><br />Here are the listed ingredients:<br />Organic oat flakes, organic honey, organic sunflower seeds, organic sesame seed, organic sultanas, peanut oil, cinnamon.<br /><br />1 cup (remember, that's a much larger serving than many list) contains 390 calories (110 from fat), 13g total fat (20% RDA), 2g saturated fat (10% RDA), no cholesterol, no sodium (I like that), 59g carbohydrate (20% RDA), 9g dietary fiber (36% RDA), 15g sugar, 12g protein.  It also has 4% RDA Vitamin A, 6% Vitamin C, 6% Calcium, 20% Iron, 24% Thiamin, 12% Riboflavin.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty good muesli.  It stays more crisp/firm in milk than other muesli that I've tried, including the Bob's product.  It's as if each flake is coated in honey and that helps it to retain a firmer texture.  That may be good or not as good, depending on your preferences.<br /><br />I also think it's a bit more expensive than I'd prefer.  Bob's is the better value, as I see it.<br /><br />While I'm giving the product 4 stars, I doubt I'll buy it again.  That's not because it isn't good, but because I don't think it's a particularly good value and again I'm not crazy about all of the honey going on, even if it is tasty nonetheless.

review/summary: Only the best for our Standard Poodle!
review/text: I am so happy to find these dog treats for sale by Amazon!  Even though these are made by a local company with fresh, healthy ingredients it seems that the big pet store chains - even a regional chain store -  have not been willing to carry these dog treats.  Our standard poodle seems to have a bit of "cat" in her:  she is downright finnicky.  She also has some allergies; and 4legz Dognuts have healthy ingredients she can eat. They seem to be her favorite, so I'm happy to be able to find a consistent supplier!

We just received our first order through Amazon and have to say that the purchase was easy, the shipping was free and the packages arrived quickly and in great shape.  Our Yellow Lab and Springer Spaniel love these treats the best and they always smell so good...who could blame them?  Our family is happy to buy these all natural healthy dog treats made by 4Legz, a small company who started out of the love of their dog with food allergies!  These treats make great gifts for all dog lovers, we always give them to friends, family and business associates throughout the year and especially at Christmastime.  Who doesn't want their dogs to have the best?!

review/text: I love this tea. I suffer from fatigue, mild depresssion and fairly severe social anxiety. I have found that this tea gives me a little pep without being overly stimulating. It helps with motivation. It brightens my mood significantly. It also takes the edge off in social situations to some degree for me. It has a pleasant taste and aroma. It seems to help settle a slightly queasy stomach also. Once it helped a pretty persistent (but not  severe) headache quite nicely as well. I am very pleased with this product. For me it is the best tea I've found thus far.

review/summary: coca de mate tea, delicious!
review/text: i, probably like most people reading this page about this product, thought there was no way it would provide the benefits the package says. relief from headaches, appetite suppressant, wakefulness, feeling of wellbeing are all said to come about by drinking the tea.<br />i brewed up tea in near boiling water with 2 teabags, and let it steep for over and hour to cool down. i then poured the tea in a glass with ice, so in effect it was ice tea.<br />a pleasant taste not unlike green tea, and i'll be darned if my mouth felt numb! i was thirsty so i drank it rather quick, and pretty soon, my daily afternoon caffeine crash was lifted with my headache and just felt like it was a very nice day. went to my cubicle and got to work and time seemed to fly. it was like a very strong espresso but without the jittery effects of the caffiene.<br />my friend made some with 4 teabags, with a larger amount of water so he could make 2 cups. he wound up drining it himself over the course of the afternoon and he was, in his words 'feeling great, able to concentrate, focus, and it made normally bad parts of work just fly by'...<br /><br />i hear you can chew the leaves too for a stronger effect but you have to use baking soda to release the alkaloids. however, there is very little, to such a small amount of cocaine (less than .08%). not sure were the energy seems to come from.<br />but i would take this over a 64oz MT.dew, or a double/triple espresso anyday. no sugar crash, no headaches, and it doesn't make you stay up all nite, or kill your apatite.<br /><br />this is a great tasting tea that is definitely something people should try if they are allergic or otherwise avoid caffeine.

review/summary: No problems with either supplier or product...
review/text: My main concern with ordering this from Australia was that it might be stopped at customs by someone who couldn't distinguish that there is a difference between coca and cocaine. I've heard stories about these products not making it to some customers in the UK, which is about as ridiculous as seizing a bread roll because of the poppyseeds on top. But I digress...<br /><br />Anyway, the tea arrived quicker than any of the other random stuff I ordered, in the same package as is pictured, and even included a sample of Anise tea, and Clove and Cinnamon. The taste? Well, it's not unpleasant. The aroma is like grass clippings, but don't let that put you off. And I can't vouch for migraine recovery or any of the other wonders this product is supposed to achieve (probably because I don't suffer migraines). But all in all, a positive experience ordering from Andina store.

They're quite expensive as compared to regular tea and make for a great change-up, but caffeine offers the user a far superior pick-me-up than what you can get from the coca leaf teas in my opinion. As I said, the taste is very original and one you'll appreciate. I think the only issue is how much one cares to pay for its novelty.

review/summary: OK for an alternative snack
review/text: Purchased this variety pack and although I was VERY impressed with Amazon Prime shipping (I literally received it in less than 24 hours!), the snack itself is average tasting.  Mostly like flavorless cardboard.  The best flavor is the jalapeno one, pretty spicy.  It satisfies the crunch and salt factor, but no way is this a replacement for real chips.  I recommend PopChips original flavor which reminds me of Munchos, or PopChips BBQ flavor; both are satisfying and taste very good.  I would NOT purchase these Gourmet Basics Smart Fries again.  I even joked with my co-workers when they asked me what I was eating.."They're Smart Fries, but they're not so smart since they don't taste that good!"  They tasted for themselves and they all pretty much agreed with me.

review/text: I'm really disappointed in these, unless for some reason I got a bad box of them!  I've been buying the plain Pop Chips for over a year now, very happy with them but was looking for something new.  Well, these are too salty for me,,,,,I can't eat them.  So I'm giving the entire box away tomorrow to get them out of here.  What a bummer!  That's the problem when you try something new with Amazon in the food category, you have to buy a boatload,,,and if it doesn't work out, you've wasted $20.00.  I don't  see what the point is in air popping something so it's low in fat but then making it way too salty,,,,sure defeats the purpose in my viewpoint.  Not good,,,,I'm really not pleased.

review/text: For the cost this is not a good snack but if you don't mind how expensive they are then these can't be beat for calorie counters. A single bag offers tremendous taste and fulfillment for such low levels of calories and fat. My wife loves Popchips and I don't count calories but we both love these fries (mostly). Brief flavour rundown:<br /><br />Jalapeno is very hot. Tastes good. If you like jalapeno, you'll love these.<br /><br />Honey Mustard is the best flavour. Rich, bold, strong taste, very flavourful and high quality.<br /><br />Sea Salt is good but bare and basic.<br /><br />Honey BBQ is great. Weak BBQ flavour compared to most potato chips but still quality.<br /><br />Vinegar is decent, pretty good vinegar taste, again weak compared to most potato chips.<br /><br />Vintage Cheddar is the poorest of the lot, with a dry and musty white cheddar taste, which though real, tastes fake.

You get a heap of pieces for 110 cals (I think about 60), and it definitely does satisfy that salty snack craving I get from time to time. As for the flavors, we got the 6 variety mix. Some were definitely good (the BBQ and japapeno ones were best in my opinion) but others were a bit rough to get through (like the vinegar/salt). Regardless, I definitely plan to get some more in the future.

review/text: If you want to eat a lot for only a few calories these are great. However the sea salt flavor is very bland and has essentially no flavor.

I much prefer PopChips (especially the Sour Cream & Onion flavor) and recommend going with their variety pack instead. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVFDOO">Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a>

review/summary: Light but Filling !!
review/text: Excellent snack food to hold one over until the next meal. Very light but filling... I was amazed at how much is in one bag. I have not tried all the flavors yet but the ones I did I enjoyed. BBQ, Sea salt, Honey Mustard and the Salt & Vinegar were very good. I would like to have had a bit more flavor on the Salt and Vinegar but it was still tasty.

review/summary: GREAT HEALTHY SNACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I just bought a box of these salt smart fries and gave them to my kids trying to get them on a healthier diet. they loved them!!!! They said that they gave it out to their friends and so it seems that they all loved it! I got phone calls from their mothers asking were I bought this great snack from. There was a perfect hint of salt and definently not to salty like other reviews. I just ordered the 6 flavor case as the reviews were amazing. Thank you for making such a great snack.

She grabs the Smart Fries and tells me, "look these have 80% less fat". We bought the product of course, when we got home I was hungry and ate half the bag my mom ate the other half. They were delicious, crunchy, airy texture, also great flavor, low in fat and calories! I want to buy more.<br />My mom is not calorie conscious and loved the fries.

review/summary: Not bad, not great...
review/text: I personally did not like these, but I gave the rest of the box to my mother and she had me order two more cases.  These are probably a good item for dieting because you think you are getting a lot for the calorie amount, but the flavor to me (and my husband) was sort of gummy and styrofoamy.  I could not finish a whole bag.  That didnt mean I was full, that meant I had gotten tired of them and wanted something more satisfying.  It is like eating a pound of celery when you really wanted a grilled cheese.<br /><br />By the way, I love the Pop Chips.  Much more flavor.<br />And my review was up for no less than a minute when I got a "not helpful" so I am not sure how this is not helpful, but the company requested that I write a review. If they are not happy that I didnt like the product, that is too bad.

review/summary: Need Improvement
review/text: Love Pop Chips and thought I'd give these a try.  First of all, I should say that the flavors are really, really good.  However, something in the manufacturing process ensures that very little flavor actually "sticks" to the fries.  I wish they could somehow infuse the flavor INTO the fries themselves.  As they are, they are like eating little pieces of styrofoam with a tiny bit of flavored powder on them.  As soon as the enter your mouth, the flavor comes off and you're left to chew and swallow the tasteless piece of styrofoam.  They use plenty of seasoning...it's just that most of it ends up in the bottom of the bag.  Dry powder just doesn't stay on a dry fry very well.  These have the potential of being very good.  And it's a good sized snack for the calories.  I just wish the actual fries had some flavor, instead of just the powder that falls right off.

My order came in from the shipping company in a rather squashed box and I thought it was okay at first, but once I got a better look, the bags inside the box all had been pushed on hard enough to have small holes, so I emailed the vendor through Amazon and they responded the same afternoon that they would ship out a new box with the product I had ordered!  I think these smart fries are the best snacks and my two year old loves them too, so we were very excited about the quick resolution!  Thank you!

review/text: Gourmet Basics indeed! I think the basics are to keep it simple and let the natural flavor of the food shine through. I am blown away that they have actually managed to make a "natural food" taste faker than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00346J90Y">Andy Capp Hot Fries, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>. Rice cakes have a luxurious mouth-feel compared to these. I couldn't get past the fake flavor and horrible texture.<br /><br />I just can't imagine what type of odd palate people must have to think that these abominations are tasty. Perhaps people who are on a restricted diet might find these a convenient snack food. Or parents tricking their kids into eating healthy. I can almost promise the parents that these snacks will go uneaten. I would have been more likely to eat the unsweetened Baker's Chocolate in the pantry before I'd eat these.<br /><br />Though this product might be suggested by Amazon if you purchase Popcorners or Popchips, do not buy it. These are nothing like Popcorners or Popchips, these "Smart Fries" are nothing but awful.

review/text: I really like potato snacks and have not tried many that I did not like. This one however, I felt I had to report my experience. These are the worst potato snacks I have ever tried. not only do they not taste like potatoes, but they are also very bland as well. Put it this way, I received a case of 12 3oz bags and I opened one bag and ate about half the bag. The rest I had to throw out and I won't even inflict coworkers with this product by leaving them in the break room for free. Instead, I plan on using the bags as shipping protection to fill empty space inside a few boxes I have outgoing. That's right folks, packing material. That's what these excess bags of smart fries are good for.

The Honey Mustard & Onion has a decent flavor but it fades almost as soon as you start crunching.  The Sea Salt had almost no flavor at all.  The texture is great, a bit like a skinnier, more crunchy (yet light) Cheese puff.  I love the texture, I love the idea but the flavor needs to be amped up CONSIDERABLY.  I wish I hadn't purchase so much since I don't want to eat them.

review/summary: Very very tasty snack
review/text: Attracted by the packaging, I purchased a bag [of the Classic Sea Salt flavor] in a local 'gourmet market'.  At 110 calories, I suspected that I had been, as frequently happens, fooled by the 'serving size' (you know how it goes, 2.5 pieces = a 'serving' - so there are actually 7 'servings'/bag)  BUT, NO, what a pleasant surprise - 110 calories was for the WHOLE delicious bag!  They're non-greasy, light as a feather and unexpectedly filling - I almost couldn't finish the bag.  I noticed they were produced here in NY, which I also liked and, after going online to find out more about them, decided to splurge for a case [of 1 oz. bags] to try all the varieties.<br /><br />One ounce doesn't sound like very much but they are so light that it is actually a very full bag and definitely more than enough for a single serving.  (The 3 oz. bag contains substantially more then you would want for just one person)<br /><br />Favorites so far are:<br />Honey Mustard & Onion<br />Vintage Cheese<br />Classic Sea Salt<br /><br />I don't have kids but I expect these would work extremely well as a lunch box addition.<br /><br />My only suggestion to the company would be that it might be a good idea if they made them available for purchase in smaller quantities.  I'm afraid many people will be put off by having to purchase in 12- & 24-bag sized cases.<br /><br />But, if you do decide to purchase, I also have no doubt that you'll have no trouble sharing them with friends and will probably be back for more sooner than you expected.
