review/summary: The BEST Wheat Free Bread Mix!
review/text: I have been searching for a good-tasting wheat-free bread mix since I found out I cannot have wheat. This is by far the BEST that I have tried. And you can make it in your bread maker. I also cannot have dairy or eggs, so I use Ener-G Egg Replacer (about 2-3 eggs worth) and it works great! My friends and family who can eat regular bread prefer Pamela's over any bread that has wheat in it!

review/summary: May cause discomfort
review/text: I tried many gluten free breads. Flavor-wise, this bread is good. But the real issue I had with this bread is that it caused me quite a lot of discomfort because of bloating and gas. Yes, it's awkward to admit that, but I wanted to warn others from potential painful symptoms.<br /><br />I have celiac as well as ulcerative colitis, so my digestive system is sensitive. I bought the 6-pack from amazon, and with the first loaf I baked I thought the symptoms might be related to something else I ate. By the second loaf my suspicion grew stronger. With the third, I decided to do a little experiment and just eat the bread by itself and see if it's really the source of the discomfort/gas. The answer is yes.<br /><br />I should note that I did not have these symptoms with Bob's red mill<br />gluten free bread (which is also tasty). There is definitely something in Pam's bread mix that the digestive system of some people might disagree with.<br /><br />Hope it help,

review/text: Hey celiacs, this is the best bread I've found by far.  I make it at home with a hand mixer, it's simple to make and nondairy.  Moreover, it's so tasty that nonceliac friends like to eat it too (but I rarely let them).  Well worth the cost.

review/summary: Best gluten free bread mix BY FAR
review/text: I've tried all of the national products and this is not only the best, but it is actually GOOD.  My gluten tolerant kids prefer it to store bought regular bread.  We use olive oil when making it - rather than regular vegetable oil.  Don't know if that makes a huge difference, but everyone loves this bread.  Highest recommendation!

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Bread out there
review/text: Pamela's Wheat-Free Amazing Bread Mix is perhaps the best mix currently available for people that can not tolerate Gluten.  The texture and taste is the closest I've found to a dense wheat bread.  I frequently add nuts and seeds, or cinnamon to alter the tastes and characteristics.  The product also can be used to make a very good pizza crust.  If you still want bread, but can't handle Gluten...this product is for you.

The texture of the resulting loaf of bread is the same whether you use the recommended 'heavy-duty stand mixer' or a hand held mixer.  I am very pleased with this product and will continue to buy it for my gluten-free bread needs.

review/summary: TO DIE FOR!!!!
review/text: Oh my God, this is the best gluten free bread I've had in 12 years since my diagnosis.  That includes home made bread, disastrous flops from my breadmaker, down to the store-bought breads that taste like cardboard. It looks like real bread, smells like bread, tastes good (OK, fresh wheat bread from a bakery tastes better...) and you can even slice it thin.<br /><br />  This bread doesn't disintegrate into a handful of crumbs.  (Till now, I always had to eat a GF sandwich hunched over the sink to catch the crumbs.)  It makes great sandwiches, toast, cinnamon toast, toasted cheese sandwiches, BLT's, etc.  I even made a hamburger bun out of some of the dough.  The only failure so far was French Toast: it didn't absorb much of the egg and milk mixture.<br /><br />For Easter, I made a turkey with gluten free stuffing and gravy.  It was heaven on earth!  The whole family loved it, even though I was only Celiac in the bunch.<br /><br />I never bought this in the health food store because it was so expensive.  It's very affordable on Amazon prescheduled delivery.  I've been using Pamela's Baking mix for many years.  It's awesome.

review/summary: Best GF Mix I've Tried
review/text: I've been making Pamela's Gluten-Free Bread Mix for quite some time now and absolutely love it.  The mix makes a dense loaf that can be enhanced with the addition of molasses and sesame seeds, or with the addition of herbs such as dill, oregano or basil.  I've added other herbs and spices, as well as parmesan cheese, and the bread always turns out fantastic.  The mix also makes great sandwich buns.  I highly recommend this product.

review/text: Iv'e tried a few different gluten-free breads and they all left a LOT to be desired.  I ate them only because I hadn't stumbled across this brand of bread mix yet.  When I did, I really liked it and then I ordered it by the 6-pak.  I've made, plain, cheese and cinnaman in my breadmaker and have enjoyed them all.  I do have to hold myself back from slicing off the first warm piece and loading it with butter.  Other then that I have NO complaints.

review/summary: Not so great : (
review/text: This GF bread mix was not my favorite.  I prefer GF Pantry.  Pamelas was really dense and tasted like bisquits not white bread.  GF Pantry had all the attributes of white bread, unlike Pamelas, first it was actually white, it's fluffy and it tastes like white bread.  So anyway I will be buying GF Pantry from here on.

review/summary: Eating Bread Again!
review/text: My wife can no longer eat products containing wheat, so she had to give up sandwiches, her morning toast and other bread-based products.  This excellent mix solved the problem and returned all of those treats to her menu.  The mix worked perfectly in our bread machine.  Just follow the simple instructions.  We use extra large eggs in our home, so I adjusted the recipe to use a bit less water to compensate.  Worked just fine.  We will try more of this company's products in the future.

review/summary: pizza and bread are okay, DO NOT make the pie crust recipe
review/text: This would have gotten 4 or 5 stars if the manufacturer hadn't caused me major frustration today with one of the recipes on the bag.<br /><br />The bread made from this mix is okay, not REAL bread but close as one can get without wheat.<br /><br />Pizza crust was fine too.<br /><br />I used it to make pie crust, following the recipe on the bag.  What a disaster.  IMPOSSIBLE to get the pie dough transferred to the pan, kept falling apart.  No way I could get the top crust on in one piece.  I ended up cutting strips.  Tastes okay but very frustrating to make.<br /><br />Also, the recipe is for a tart crust, not a pie crust as that it insists you use butter.  Makes the crust REALLY rich, even substituting half shortening as the allows.

review/summary: PIZZA FINALLY!
review/text: You have to plan ahead a little bit, becuase the dough has to "rest" for an hour, but I was REALLY satisfied with the outcome. Since going gluten/wheat-free about 2 months ago, I have not had my very favorite food = pizza. Today I planned ahead and made the crust with Pamela's mix. I don't have a heavy duty mixer, so I just stirred it by hand with a wooden spoon for 3 minutes (the directions say to stir with the mixer on medium speed for 3 minutes). It turned out just fine. I used cooking spray on a large rectangular insulated cookie sheet and it browned nicely and didn't stick at all (even though my oven usually runs hot and burns). After I topped it I put it back in the oven for 10 minutes, and then slid it off off the cookie sheet directly on to the rack to crisp up a bit. It tasted great, although if I could criticize at all it was a little on the sweet side for pizza crust, but it was still great and satisfied my pizza craving.

review/text: I've tried many different gluten and dairy free breads and this is the first one that feels like bread and tastes great too!  It is soft enough to wrap around a hotdog if you choose, even days after baking.  And fresh baked, I have to hide it from my kids or there will be nothing left for lunch.  I have used it to make hamburger buns as well, which worked perfectly.  I thank Pamela's Products for making packing lunches as easy as it was before we stopped eating gluten.  Truly an amazing bread mix!

review/summary: Excellent GF Bread!
review/text: This review is for Pamela's Wheat-Free Bread mix; some of the other reviews here are for other products in the Pamela's line.<br /><br />The mix contains several alternative flours: sorghum, tapioca, sweet rice, brown rice, white rice, and millet, along with molases, honey, and other ingredients.  The yeast packet is included in the package, but is not mixed into the flours.  2 eggs and 1/4 cup of oil are needed to complete the recipe. The label has recipes for pizza crust, bagels, and pie crusts using the mix.  I have not tried these applications, so I cannot comment on them.<br /><br />I love this bread. The mix makes a large loaf (I use the mixer method and bake it in the oven; I don't use the bread machine).  The bread has a nice, soft texture.  It is not crumbly at all.  I have shared it with several people who eat gluten, as well as others who cannot; everyone likes it.  The flavor reminds me of a soft whole wheat bread, and is slightly sweet. I keep the bread at room temperature, and it tastes great even without toasting or heating first - an amazing feat for GF bread.<br /><br />The option for making rolls (in a muffin tin) with this mix is wonderful -finally, a roll that looks "real" and tastes good. I let the loaf bread cool fully before cutting it, but the rolls can be eaten piping hot, right out of the oven.  The rolls can also be frozen and reheated when needed.<br /><br />Try this bread - it is so much better than any of the frozen pre-made GF bread out there.

review/summary: Very nice texture, great taste
review/text: We've eaten already-prepared gluten-free bread for years. But with the cut-backs in our budget, I decided to start making my own GF bread. This mix has a very nice texture and good flavor. I did add about 1/4 cup of honey, however, because I like my bread to have a little bit of sweetness to it. I poured the honey into a measuring cup, added the amount of water called for in the recipe and stirred it up good. I then added it to the mix when it called for the water. I also tried the cinnamon bread recipe that they have on the back as a variation and my kids thought it was the best GF bread they had ever had. I used zante currants which are like little tiny raisins. Homemade GF bread is much better than the pre-made stuff. I make about a loaf a week, slice it up, and put it in a ziploc bag in the fridge. We then toast the slices before we use them.

review/summary: Fast and Easy Delicious Bread
review/text: Since my husband was diagnosed with Celiac, I've become quite the gluten-free baker. I've collected all the ingredients to make great cakes from scratch, however baking bread is a totally different thing. Anyway, the entire line of Pamela's gluten-free, wheat-free flours are fantastic. I love making pizza with this flour. It's gives a fluffier and slightly sweet crust. The trick with this pizza dough is to bake it 'til it's slightly brown before you put the toppings on. you'll get a very crispy crust. I also have fun with her suggestion of adding herbs to the flour while mixing. I also sprinkle herbs on with a little olive oil before the first bake.  I use this flour weekly for focaccia...Oh, and no eggs!

review/summary: Very Versatile
review/text: So far, I've used this mix to make bread, buns, bagels, pound cake, piecrust, etc.  It's the most versatile GF mix I've found and the taste is so good, my co-workers have asked me for some.  It doesn't taste stale if you can't heat it and it stays fairly good for a few days just sitting on the counter in a Ziploc.  It works just fine using my Kitchen Aid mixer and my oven, I didn't need a bread machine.<br /><br />The suggestion on the package to add 2 TBSP molasses for a whole wheat bread taste makes a good GF bread great.  Also, I've continued using a tip I picked up somewhere to substitute 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed + 1/4 cup water for 2 eggs (more fiber, less fat).  These two things turn out a good brown bread that makes a great ham & Swiss w/ stone ground mustard.<br /><br />Amazon Subscribe & Save has the best price on this product that I've seen.

Often the bread was heavy tasting or donwright strange tasting, with much work and effort often just wasted.<br /><br />After trying Pamela's Wheat Free Bread Mix, it was obvious I had been wasting my time.  I have tried many variations suggested on the package, made foccacia, buns, rolls and many other uses such as pizza dough and calzones.  This works perfectly in my bread maker, (using only one knead cycle) and have also used mixing by hand.  The bread comes out perfectly everytime, with just the right amount of consistency & rise, without gigantic air holes or packed so tightly it looks like pound cake.

review/summary: BEST EVER BREAD WITH MANY OTHER OPTIONS  A MUST HAVE !!
review/text: This is incredible bread. AS big as "normal" sandwich bread. I used my bread machine, and added raisins cinnamon and sugar at the last rising, and its the best ever raisin cinnamon bread I have had ever. Also, I took half of the large loaf and froze them, now I just take out what I want and its fresh and awesome each time. By far the BEST for bread out there and sooo easy to make with a bread machine.  Definintely a MUST HAVE!!

Pamela's is the best tasteing, best texture I've found that I don't have to measure 4 or 5 flours to make.  Just oopen the bag and mix.  I buy this stuff by the case.  I love to make rolls with it.

review/summary: REAL BREAD!!!
review/text: It has been 11 months since I began a gluten free diet and this is the first bread I've eaten which tastes good. It is moist and holds together well even when sliced warm out of the bread maker. I bake it in a Breadman TR 875 and follow the directions on the bag of the bread mix (which says to NOT use the gluten free setting). I'm baking bread from Pamela's bread mix for my 11 year old granddaughter who also must eat gluten free. It allows her to take sandwiches to school like the other kids. The bread toasts well and probably freezes well, but we eat it too fast to worry about that. It bakes well with added herbs, cheese, etc. It's a good product.

review/summary: Bread that doesn't crumble, amazing!
review/text: Like other reviewers, I had high expectations when I baked this bread in my Zojirushi bread machine and was not disappointed. My first experience, however, was not positive. The first loaf collapsed - due to the fact that I mistakenly added too much liquid. Fortunately, all subsequent loaves have baked perfectly. The texture of this bread is soft and does not crumble. The taste is a bit on the sweet side, but it is still delicious. My non-GF son loves this bread (especially when it is fresh) and prefers it over his gluten wheat bread. Definitely worth a try.

review/text: This is the best gluten free bread mix I have found.  It is simple to make using a bread machine,(it can also be made in the oven).  Although the bread does not rise as much as I would like it to, the slices are more than large enough for an adult sized sandwich.  It holds together without toasting, no crumbling.  It stays fresh for several days, and freezes well. I found that using 1 less tablespoon of water than the recipe calls for improved the quality of the bread.

review/text: After my daughters celiac diagnosis, we had to buy the frozen gluten free breads and the kids were NOT happy.  Although, the frozen bread is good to eat right after toasting it, it just did not work well for sandwiches in the kids lunch box.  So, I searched the net for bread recipes and became really frustrated because my bread would cave in each time.  Then I found Pamela's Amazing Bread.  Let me tell you, it is truly amazing in my eyes.  Not only does it taste great, but it bakes beautifully in my bread maker.  It has a nice crust and is soft and great for sandwiches, grilled cheese, toast, etc.  We add 1/4 cup of flaxseed to the mix.  Kids love it, so mom is really happy!

I found this bread by reading reviews on celiac.com where it is highly recommended. I love this bread!!! This is the first time my son will eat bread since he has been diagnosed, since it tastes like real bread. All other gluten free breads taste nasty, and if they do not taste nasty, they have no flavor at all. Kudos to this bread, finally a real choice for kids with Celiac disease. Thank you so much.

review/summary: Amazing difference second time around
review/text: I have tried lots of different bread recipes (GF), you could build a house with most of the results.<br /><br />My first batch of this was a disaster!  Heavy, greasy, I actually threw it away.  Second time around I used extra virgin olive oil, half a cup of rice milk and an extra tsp of egg replacer.  I could not believe it when I looked through the window, I had to move the oven shelf up because the bread had risen 2"!!  If I hadn't have baked the first batch myself I would not believe that it was the same product.<br /><br />I guess it is a good thing I bought a box of 6 because I would definitely not have bothered again.<br /><br />I don't think it is as good as 'proper' bread though, my toddler is allergic to wheat, dairy and eggs, as she is still breastfeeding I have had to give up the good stuff too, hopefully I will be able to manage a bit better with this mix.

review/text: This is one of the best GF bread mixes available. I use it to bake all sorts of breads. I use it for most baking, since my girlfriend is not only gluten intolerant, but also dairy intolerant. Made some great Banana-blueberry muffins last week, got rave reviews.

review/text: I love this mix because it is so simple to make and my kids love the taste.<br />We buy it by the case. We make two packages at a time and freeze one loaf (cut in two) while enjoying the other loaf. This cuts down on clean up and time in the kitchen.<br /><br />One tip... I cut preparation time in half by doing the following: I mix the yeast into the flour first, then I heat the liquids to 110 degrees before adding them. Once the mixing is complete, I place the loaf pans in a warm toaster oven. Rising is complete in about 30 minutes. Bake time only takes about 30 minutes this way. Delicious bread!

review/summary: Best GF bread!
review/text: This is the best all-around GF bread I've found. The taste and texture are good. It stays moist and soft even after refrigeration or sitting in a lunch box for a few hours. To save money I bake mostly from scratch, but I can't find a bread recipe that matches the all the wonderful qualities of this bread. No microwaving necessary with this bread. The only dowside I've found, is that its a little dense.

review/summary: Great bread alternative
review/text: My son is allergic to wheat and eggs and this mix makes by far the best bread one can hope without these two ingredients. I use this mix in our bread machine with an egg replacer and it makes a nice loaf with a good texture and great taste, especially if you toast it. Pamela's Products other wheat-free mixes are also great if you want to make cookies or brownies that taste as good as any "normal" ones.

I served it to company and They loved it so much I had to make another loaf to serve later. What a wonderful surprise and I have ordered it a second time.. I didn't have high hopes but thought why not try since I have a wheat allergy.. It was worth the purchase again and again.. Thank you Pamela.

review/text: This is the best GF bread mix that I have ever tried.  We are also dairy free so we make it with 1/2 cup of soy milk.  It is great the way it is, although sometimes we add some cinnamon and raisens.  Each loaf lasts 3 full days.  We have frozen half loaves, and that works although the bread is more dry than when it is fresh.  Highly recommend.

review/text: My son with AUTISM has been on the GFCF diet for 9 yrs now (he's 11).  He loves this bread and pretty much won't eat others!  It's easy to make and bake (by hand - I do not have a bread machine). I use Soy milk.  It bakes perfect every time :)  Just follow the directions. Slice when it's cool and freeze. It makes great sandwich bread and toast.  The Sweet Bread recipe on the package is good, too.  I haven't yet tried the other recipes but am sure of their success and great taste and texture as well.  What's even better is Amazon's great price on the case of six!  You simply can't beat it.

review/summary: Great Product - Pricing is the same as Fred Meyer!
review/text: Firstly, let me say that this is a great product if you are looking for a wheat free bread as I was.<br />It's moist, tasty and great for bread machines.<br /><br />The only reason I ordered this was because of the big 23% OFF sign, however what they reduced in product price, they made back in shipping.  Also, there was NO DISCOUNT for buying 6 packets.<br />Price including shipping was $36 and change.<br /><br />Bottom line is that instead of waiting several days to buy this product, just go to your local Fred Meyer where it's sold for $6 per packet! If they had not "reduced" the price by 23%, then you would be getting ripped off severely as you would be paying close to $10 more - you can get an entire grocery list delivered to your home from Fred Meyer for about the same!!<br />When you factor in that you also get club card rewards, you are better off buying it from Fred Meyer than direct from the manufacturer....I won't be ordering online again.<br /><br />But good product!

review/text: Although this bread tasted decent. My husband had a severe allergic reaction. When he contacted Pamela's Products they told him many has had an allergic reaction to this mix. He advised them that they should post this information. Whether they will or not is up to them. This reaction caused his stomach to close and he had to go in and have it ballooned back open. If they would have posted "many people" having allergic reactions, we may have thought twice about trying this product and could have saved him a lot of severe pain plus the approx. $4000.00 for the procedure he had to have done. He has had no reaction to the Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix and the pancakes are really good. Good luck to those trying this product.

review/summary: Makes a good loaf... but indigestable for some people
review/text: I'll admit this product makes a great loaf in the bread machine (use the dark setting, then let the moisture air out)... it has great texture, lightness, rises well, and has really good flavor.<br /><br />However, I found this product to be almost indigestable Even one piece in the morning with breakfast produces gastrointestinal distress all day. I've eaten many other gluten-free products (and occasionally some gluten ones) and have never run across this effect with any other flour blend. Before I figured out this bread was the culprit, I thought I had a stomach virus.<br /><br />In skimming reviews here and elsewhere, I've found a good number of people have had the same issue. I wrote to the company and they said that some people have trouble with sorghum and millet flours. The sorghum flour is the first ingredient, so that may be the case. I do think this bread dough is more glue-like than gluten products, so that may be part of the trouble. The Baking & Pancake Mix and the Brownie Mix seem to be fine for me, they have different ingredients. You can also make a loaf from the Baking & Pancake Mix, there is a recipe on the Pamela's web site - it's just not as nice as the Bread Mix loaf.<br /><br />Very disappointing.

review/summary: Wow...this mix makes Amazing rolls!!!!
review/text: We have a new Celiac diagnosis in our home.  We tried Ener-G and one other brand premade bread that, even though they cost $6 each for a tiny loaf, neither were edible.  We had just about given up on baked goods in general when we were lucky enough to stumble across some promising reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Tonight I made Tastefully Simple beer bread (a family favorite) and Pamela's Gluten Free Rolls, so the gluten intolerant child wouldn't feel left out, to go with our beef stew.  Well, 5 people were "supposed" to eat the beer bread and only 1 was "supposed" to eat the rolls, however the rolls were a hit with all of us.<br /><br />My gluten free daughter was in heaven, not having a decent bread product since she was diagnosed about 6 weeks ago.  The rest of us knew the rolls weren't exactly like our usual wheat based ones, but they didn't have a weird texture or after taste and were quite yummy anyway.<br /><br />We mixed the eggs, oil, water, yeast, and packaged mix in the mixer for 3 minutes.  I used an ice cream scoop to fill 15 muffin cups.  Let them rest/rise for an hour and baked for 23-25 minutes.  They rose beautifully and got a delicious looking color.<br /><br />Next time, I am going to underbake most of the rolls so they can be frozen to be thawed and reheated at a later time.<br /><br />Wow...I am so excited she doesn't have to live the rest of her life without delicious bread :)

But in November, the bread started to have a very strange chemical after taste and also gave both my husband and myself serious digestive upset.  I made a few more loaves to see if it was just one bag of the mix, but no, it seems to be a recurring problem.  We also purchased a bag of Pamela's GF white cake mix from the grocery store recently and it had the same noxious taste and smell.  What's up?  I have three cases of the bread mix that I plan to return to Amazon for a refund.

I have been making my bread from this every week- it slices well (I get 14-20 slices from a loaf) and is great days later, still soft and doesn't need toasting.  When I did the sweet bread recipe on the loaf my family went crazy.  This is my go to bread now and I just bake it slice it and ziploc it, leaving it on the counter just like glutened bread.  And the recipes you can use it for!  Check out the Pamela's site for recipes.  Amazon subscribe and save has the best prices though.

review/text: I am new to a gluten free diet and have to say that I have not been all that thrilled with GF breads.  They either smell bad, taste terrible or don't cook completely in my Bread Machine leaving them doughy in the middle.  This product however made me go WOW in every way!  I love it!!  It cooks though, it is soft and moist, has a nice texture and does not smell strange as other gf recipes have.  If you try it and like it you can also save on the cost by purchasing the 4 pound bag.  To make bread from bulk per a phone call with Pamela's - it is 2 1/4t yeast and 3 1/2c bread mix then follow the instructions on the individual bag: in a 2 cup liquid measuring cup, measure 1/4c oil, 2 eggs, fill with warm water to 2 cups liquid, plus add 2T additional water (I omit the last 2T of water personally).  I get a 4 1/2 - 5 inch tall loaf.  Perfect. Thank You Pamela's!

review/text: I bought the 6 pack of these mixes and was really excited that they turned out so well in my bread machine.  The bread tastes amazing, but about 2 hours later the problems start.  Myself and everyone who has tried it has developed severe bloating and gas that lasts about 12 hours.  I think it may be from the sorghum flour, as I don't have any intolerances to eggs, milk, etc and neither do my family members.  I also tried making the pizza crust, which also tastes very good, but results in the same effects.

review/summary: I also use it for pie crust
review/text: Made bread in both oven and bread machine.  The oven method seems to produce an 'exploded' top, which I assume is from the yeast rising too quickly?  Either way the bread turns out moist and stays fairly well in the fridge.  I always toast the bread on a dark setting which produces a light tan, probably due to the moisture in the loaf.  Every GF bread I have tried has always seem to be much better tasting toasted and I think that is the rule if the GF world?<br /><br />I also use this for pie crust (you do not use the yeast).  The pie crust has 3 variants:<br /><br />1) Standard - 2 sticks of butter<br />2) Flakier - 1 stick of butter and 8 OZ of shortening<br />3) Non Dairy - 1 stick of margarine and 8 OZ of shortening<br /><br />I've tried both the standard and flakier versions and both turned out well.  Never had a complaint about my pies (yet!).  You may want to warm up the bottom crust first or it may be a little raw, but I have also had that happen on regular pie crusts.<br /><br />If you do try the pie crust - make sure you put the mixture in the fridge for a bit to ensure it is cold, otherwise it may be too sticky.  I roll it between 2 sheets of wax paper that has a quick spray of PAM applied.  Makes the transfer to the pie plate a snap!

review/summary: A versatile, vegan, gluten free bread mix
review/text: When I first started eating gluten free, I was happy with GF's Pantry's White Bread. As time went by however, I started looking for more taste, less crumble, and more versatility. I found it with Pamela's Wheat Free/Gluten Free Bread Mix. The addition of sorghum flour lends a honey-whole wheat taste and a nice structure to the finished product. I have made beautiful baked goods with this (all by hand, no stand mixer) including cinnamon buns, yummy chewy pizza crust, pie crust, French bread, pretzels, and the BEST gluten free bagels I have ever had. It's also vegan. So those with dairy or egg intolerance can play with it too! Amazon's Subscribe and Save program makes this an affordable option that I can share with my whole family. It's not just called, Mom's bread, now.
