review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: My picky eater loves this! She will eat only Gerber Organic Mac n Cheese and Gerber Organic Green Beans w/o any fussing. Yes, it is a bit runny, which makes it perfect for 4-6 month olds but it gives you the flexibility to thicken it with whatever you want for the older babies (e.g. rice cereal, meats, spinach, etc).<br /><br />Mommy loves it, too! Great taste!

review/summary: Good product, but bad from Amazon
review/text: I love Gerber organic products like this which combine veggies and/or fruits. I bought one of the "Farmers Market" from the regular grocery store to make sure my 8 month old liked it, which he did. I bought a case from Amazon, but the consistency was like soup, very runny unlike the one I bought from the store. Heating it up made it worse. Maybe it was a fluke, but the second case from Amazon ordered a few months later had the same problem.

I like the benefits of DHA and I like the listed Vegetables/Grains.<br /><br />I like the pricing, no tax, and free shipping to my door.  Can't beat the price for pack of 8 in the stores.  we get this food delivered too.<br /><br />The packs are easy to throw in diaper bag w/spoon and feed him.  Less mess and fuss.<br /><br />Our son's 11 months now and still eats this.

review/summary: a green veggie my son will eat!!
review/text: I love this gerber item!!  My son is 6 months old and is a bit particular.  He spits out most veggies, except sweet potatoes of course, and even a lot of fruits, unless I mix them with cereal to thicken them up a bit!  He loves the thick texture of this food!!!  So from a frustrated mommy, this is a great thing!!!  If your child is refusing green beans or sweet peas, give this a try!  Its got enough texture to please my babe, it may be your favorite too!!

review/summary: The incredible shrinking bar
review/text: I have been subscribing to this and other Kind products for over a year now, and have noticed that the bars are getting smaller and smaller, but the price keeps creeping up.<br /><br />It have become almost a game when the bars arrive: How much smaller are the bars going to be since the previous consignment of 3 months ago?  Maybe I should keep one from each shipment and compare its length when the next arrives.<br /><br />Of course the wrapper remains the same size, and that just adds to the fun.  I wonder if the bar will ever reduce to half the wrapper size.<br /><br />Apart from all this, the quality of the bars themselves has remained consistent, but the freshness varies from shipment to shipment.

However, as some other reviews indicated, what they actually ship you is 1 count pack of 4 - meaning 4 mini bars for the price of $22.xx. I contacted Amazon and they said they could not "fix" the problem but would offer me a full refund instead.<br /><br />If you are interested in these bars, order the regular size instead (as I did). They seem to be shipping correctly.

She was adament that I stop using highly processed food bars and move to what she calls "real food" bars. This is the one she recommended and it's delicious.  I used to love another brand of bar that is more "processed" and now that I've been eating these more "real food" items I can barely stand the old stuff.  I love the apricot and the cranberry.

review/text: I've tried a LOT of snack bars. As I become more nutrition-conscious (and wary of additives and HFCS), I have become more particular. And as always, there is the matter of taste.<br /><br />At this point, Kind bars are all I use. Everything else pales in quality, nutrition, and taste.<br /><br />Buying from REI in >12qty gets a 20% discount, about a buck-sixty each net, but Amazon (with free shipping) is still better, near a buck-and-a-quarter.<br /><br />Good for between-meal staying power, bike rides, hikes, emergency car/RV stash. They last on the shelf longer than I have been able to wait to eat them; I can't tell the difference between new bars and > 3-month-old ones from my stash. The dried-fruit content and lower-oil nuts seem to keep them naturally preserved.<br /><br />I definitely do not like the ones with peanuts in them, but that's a personal taste matter.

The tea leaves are intact, not the kind of broken leaves you often get from low-quality stuff. Remember not to use boiling water. As green tea is more delicate than oolong, boiling water will destroy the leaves. Use water of 185 degrees Fahrenheit, or 85 degrees Celsius.

review/summary: Need to improve bagging quality control
review/text: This packaging is boxed as displayed (the plastic bags are not put in burlap bags as they do with most of their other product offers which would have offered another barrier to mixing of different items). Several of the plastic bags were split open when I received them, resulting in the contents of several different products being mixed together into a big mess. When I ordered this item I also ordered another product from Amazon so not only were the Palouse Brand items protected inside their own box during shipping but also enclosed in Amazon's box with another item. Neither box was damaged. The spilled bags were the result of improper sealing of the plastic bags by Palouse Brand.<br /><br />If you want to try these items, I suggest ordering in a different offering which shows them also enclosed in the burlap bags. Since this item was shipped by Amazon and not by the 3rd party, return to Amazon was expense-free to me with the prepaid shipping label they emailed me and refund was processed as soon as they received the product back. 5 stars to Amazon as always.

review/text: Having a MiniPoodle diagnosed with allergies is no fun---when the allergy turns out to be CHICKEN--even more so.<br /><br />Got these for Shannie and at first whiff she said "NO"...oh Lord-is this special or what----I have SIX boxes.<br />Then I offered a cookie to Leo---he followed Shannies lead, sniffed and said "no thanks".<br /><br />Broke cookie in half-offered half to each pupper and they gobbled them down! Looks like we have breakfast cookies!<br /><br />WEIRD PUPPIES!!  LOL<br /><br />(I must add- the box is FULL of crumbs, cookie dust and crumbles)

review/summary: great treats for the price!
review/text: I am very picky about what I give my dogs.  They eat Diamond Naturals Large Breed Puppy Lamb & Rice Formula.  I am not a fan of by-products, corn, wheat, soy, etc.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients in these treats (the first ones that matter the most):<br />(No Soy, No Wheat)(There is corn starch though)<br /><br />*Ground Whole Grain Barley -- Lamb Meal -- Brewers Rice -- Chicken Fat* -- & so on.  (everything before the first fat listen matters the most)<br /><br />I will buy more when I run out.  These are good treats, and my dogs love them.  There are a lot in each box.  I have had them for a week and I haven't even made a dent in the first box!  Great buy.

review/summary: Not as good as before
review/text: Since I don't eat these, I can't comment on their taste.  However, I can comment on their quality.  They are too soft.  We use treats to help clean our dog's teeth.  These biscuits are so crumbly, they practically dissolve.  Also, the biscuits themselves arrive with many, many broken pieces upon opening the box.<br /><br />I don't know why you stopped carrying the other IAMS treats we used, but it would be wonderful if you could go back them if the company still makes them.

review/summary: A Classic
review/text: I've been eating a lot of soup lately as part of my diet.  And I'm happy to say that this old childhood favorite is actually food.  Unlike Campbells other soups you don't need an encyclopedia to understand what's in it.  There's tomato puree, high fructose corn syrup, spices, salt and Ascorbic and Citric Acids.<br /><br />No MSG.  No hydrolyzed anything.  Granted I am not a fan of corn syrup, but I'm giving them a break because it goes so good with crackers or a grilled cheese sandwich.<br /><br />Still killer sodium levels but if you eat the whole can mixed with water it's only 225 calories.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This review is for the soup itself, not the 48-pack here on Amazon. Buying a 48 pack seems like a good idea, but the truth is, you can get a can of this soup for cheaper at the store, usually between 80 cents to a dollar for one can, though stores like Wal-Mart and Sam's Club offer this even cheaper.<br /><br />The flavor can't be beat. Everyone has their preferred method of preparing this soup, but I make mine with almond milk (about 2/3 of a can) and a bit of garlic powder. The milk makes the soup more creamy as compared to adding a can of water, and garlic adds that delicious little kick. It tastes awesome with regular Saltines, oyster crackers, even Goldfish crackers. While a bit high in sodium, it's very low in fat and has a decent amount of vitamins so making a meal out of this is great for your diet.<br /><br />Buying these cans are also considerably cheaper than buying the ready-made Campbell's soup in the plastic microwaveable containers (Soup At Hand) and really, it's not that hard to mix this soup with some milk or water. It's so easy to prepare that even kids can do it (I did!) Nom nom nom!

review/summary: Delicious crab bisque
review/text: I take 6 cans of tomato soup, 2 cans of cream of mushroom, and 4 cans of half and half (or milk)and cream sherry (you must use cream sherry, dry sherry is not as good) and add it to fresh crabmeat for a fantastic bisque. You need to marinate the crabmeat in the sherry for an hour or two before you add it to the soup mixture. Simmer on low for a few minutes and serve right away, you'll think you've died and gone to Heaven. Sherry about 1 cup or more depending on your taste. Most of the alcohol cooks out, but don't drive for 24 hours after you eat this!

review/summary: Great Product - bad packaging
review/text: I have no complaints about the soup at all. The taste is great, it's easy to prepare and I also use it to cook. It is probably cheaper at a store but I don't have a car so I don't have to pay the expense of gas or car payments or insurance. My big complaint is that I ordered a case of 48 and 22 of them were dented. I am waiting to hear what I need to do. I guess I'm supposed to ship them back but getting to a UPS store is impossible for me and they really wouldn't want 22 dented cans of campbell's soup.

review/summary: The high fructose corn syrup is too sweet
review/text: My mother used to use the condensed soup as a sauce to top stuffed green peppers, so I bought 24 cans to use for the same purpose.<br /><br />BIG MISTAKE!<br /><br />It's WAY too sweet now, not the soup I remember. Even the consistency is different.<br /><br />I tried mixing it with standard tomato sauce which helped somewhat; still, I won't be using 24 cans.<br /><br />I guess most of them will go to the food pantry.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this soup in a while, buy one or two cans before you commit to a whole boatload.

review/summary: What Soup Is Meant To Be
review/text: A steaming hot bowl of CAMPBELL'S TOMATO SOUP for lunch is just about as good as it gets.  That zesty tomato flavor is delicious; your taste buds will be thanking you profusely.  This is a soup I grew up on and still enjoy on those occasions when nothing but a bowl of hot soup will hit the spot.<br /><br />This soup must be accompanied by crackers--better yet, peanut butter crackers.  For maximum tomato flavor pour in water, not milk, and for even more extra zest add a pinch of onion salt.  Now that's a spicy soup!  An added bonus includes the pull-off lids; no can openers required, thank you very much.  Make your lunch a hit with CAMPBELL'S TOMATO SOUP.  The middle of the day doesn't deserve drab.<br />--D.

review/summary: I will have to try it for more things
review/text: I hate to review a product unless I've tried it at least once so now I have.  Well, I baked some pork chops and am a mashed potato and gravy lover.  There were a few browning pan drippings and some from the baking pan but not enough to make any kind of a flavorful gravy.  One cube (mine are x's - neato) made the juice darker and richer and the flavor of the gravy was better than I'm used to getting with pork chops and also more of it.  For good measure, I gave it a couple drops of Kitchen Boquet.  I know they're just bullion cubes, but these are about the size of 2 American ones which never did a whole lot for me.

review/summary: Excellent dog food; especially good for dogs with health problems
review/text: We have three dogs- a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear, and two large dogs with health issues: a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer, who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago, and an 8 year old  collie mix who has irritable bowels.  Trying to find the right food so that I didn't have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy, but this Wellness Simple Solutions, along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job.<br /><br />If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach/bowel reactions, as any pediatrician will tell you, feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible, and only add ingredients as needed, after waiting for a time to watch for reactions.  Simple Solutions is the way to do this, and for a dog with irritable bowels, it is truly THE best way of feeding a commercially prepared dog food, instead of you cooking chicken and rice for your dog.  The dogs love the taste, and Wellness brand is excellent quality.

review/summary: Healthy choice for dog w/ food allergies/sensitive stomach
review/text: My 8-year old Cocker Spaniel has been on several types of food (Nutro, Iams, Natural Balance, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul, and regular Wellness). She would tolerate each for a short period of time, but then get diarrhea and would vomit. Our Vet suggested we try Wellness Simple Solutions, since it has only one protein and one carb source. We've had her on it for 3 months and she's shown no signs of upset stomach or irritable bowel. We suspect she is sensitive to chicken/chicken by-products, which the Rice and Salmon blend does not contain. The food is expensive, but it's worth the cost to have a healthy dog.....and clean house!

review/text: I have tried quite a few brands and types of kibble but none work as well in helping my Bichon to avoid skin problems, particularly itchiness, as this one does.  It helps that she really enjoys the taste too.<br /><br />Update: January 2012:<br /><br />Wellness Simple Solution Rice and Salmon is the only kibble that I feed to my bichon.  She loves it and I love the way it helps with her allergies plus the fact that she never has any digestion problems.  I use to buy the smaller bags because I was concerned about freshness.  Before finding this on Amazon, I had to special order it at a local pet specialty store and very often the packages had short time frame expiration dates.<br /><br />After seeing how good the dates were on the smaller packages that I bought from Amazon, I switched to the larger 10 lb,8 oz. bag.  I have been absolutely delighted by the freshness.  The bag that I ordered in early January 2012, arrived nicely packaged and with an expiration date of July, 2012.<br /><br />I'm happy that not only am I getting a wonderful food, made in the USA, but I can count on getting a fresh shipment too.

review/text: we thought lily,at only 6 years of age, had about a year left to live - she was that weak and sickly. we wondered how our beautiful, strong german shepherd had failed so quickly. we decided that we had nothing to lose and perhaps it'd make her last days or months more pleasant if we took her off her natural supplements (glucosamine,msm,yucca), as well her pharmaceuticals. at the same time, we decided to change her dry dog food from a well-known brand we got at the supermarket to a more natural one. we did research and decided on Wellness Simple Solutions. we chose this one specifically because it had so few ingredients. lily was having alot of g.i. problems - she frequently vomited and it contained alot of mucus;she was itching alot and developed very scaly patches on her skin. she was a mess! her zest for life was disappearing. But, that was 3 months ago! lily no longer vomits; her itching has improved 85% or more; her coat is shiny and beautiful (people admire her wherever she goes); she goes on 45 min. leash or free walks/runs now, where just 3 mos. ago she was only able to go 15-20 mins. i attribute Much of her recovery to Wellness. it's so gratifying to see her feeling so Well again!

We even tried other limited ingredient foods, only to have it upset her stomach and cause new problems. I bought this at the store thinking, "Okay, salmon and rice. This seems safe!"  I hoped that the fish would be good for her skin and the rice would be easy to digest.  We have been using this food now for a couple of months and she LOVES it, plus her scratching is gone and this food has never upset her stomach. It is sometimes hard to find in the pet stores so I'm buying on Amazon again. It saves running all over town, and the price is lower.

review/summary: Solved our skin issues
review/text: Understanding not all skin issues are alike, this food seems to have solved our issues.  My labradoodle developed a skin irritation that turned into a nasty infection in late november.  She was on Wellness Super 5 and salmon oil.  We thought it was just bacterial and dosed with antibiotics, but the irritation/infection came back worse than before.  I had tried grain free(Wellness Core), but things got worse, if anything.  We had to do another round of antibiotics due to another infection fromt he irritation and I felt like I was out of obvious solutions.  My vet suggested changing the type of protein to seafood(she has always been on chicken), so I tried this type of food.  Within a week of being fully transitioned onto this food, her excessive shedding (that started in november with the infections) had gone away and her skin had stopped developing lesions.  It's been almost a month and thing look great.  It could all be a coincidence, but I don't think I will be changing her food anytime soon!  Seems like a great solution for her.  Definitely worth trying!<br /><br />UPDATE July 28 2012<br />This formula (Salmon/Rice) has been changed to Salmon/Potato.  The number of ingredients have nearly doubled.  After months of doing so well on the Salmon/Rice food, I transitioned her onto this new food and her symptoms are re-appearing and she is not doing well.  This is a big disappointment.  I called Wellness and they said this food wasn't selling well and they changed the formulation.  Too bad - I will have to try another brand that is truly a limited ingredient diet.

It is one of the few choices out there that can be purchased on line or at a pet store without a perscription. So many pet owners try shots and pills that may be unnecessary. Start with the food!!! My dogs LOVE it, too!

review/summary: Solved a long-term diarrhea problem
review/text: Our dog developed diarrhea last fall and we tried several "cures" before finding this product.  We gradually switched her food and by the time I got to 3/4 this and 1/4 old food, her poop had firmed.  She's been on this formula for several months now without any problems.  So nice to find a healthy food that worked for her!

review/summary: Not sure if it works for allergies
review/text: My two Shih Tzu are picky eaters.  But they seem to like the Wellness foods better than any other I've tried.  However, this particular variety doesn't seem to be quite as big of a hit with them as the other Wellness canned varieties we've tried.  But they do eat it.  As for it helping with food allergies.. and for sensitive stomachs.. I'm not so sure yet.  I've been feeding it to them for several weeks now, but don't see any diference so far.

review/summary: Perfect for Dogs with Food Allergies
review/text: I have two yellow labs - one of which has severe food allergies (ear infections).  I have been using Wellness products since both were puppies and specifically the Wellness Simple brand since I discovered the allergies.  My female lab used to have persistant ear infections but since I started using the Simple line of dog food - the problems have disappeared.  I rotate between the duck and lamb flavors and she seems quite happy.  Never tried the salmon flavor.  I also treat both dogs with the Wellness biscuits (peanut/honey is their favorite).  Quality dog food well worth the cost!  My female lab is almost 7 now and the male is 5.  Both love the food and are very healthy.  Thanks Wellness!

review/summary: Mostly cured the red bumps on my dog's skin
review/text: Even our vet could not cure the red bumps on my dog's skin.  The rash and excoriation was unresponsive to oral antibiotics and topical steroid spray.  Our pet sitter recommended we try a dog food without known allergens, so we tried Wellness Rice & Salmon.  It really works! Our dog still gets some redness but she is so much better.  The only negative is that apparently the food doesn't taste that great. Our solution is to mix it with a very small amount of canned cat food (about 1 tablespoon of our cat's Newman Organics), and our dog gobbles it right down.

review/text: My dog loves this food and I like it because it's low residue and doesn't upset his tummy.  Less waste when he goes makes it more comfortable for him and easier to pick up for me.  The only complaint (besides the price!) would be the smell of the food if you sniff it.  It doesn't make his breath smell.  I may try the lamb one next time (to compare smells), but I definitely recommend this food.

review/text: I honestly wish the other reviewer would have not given this product such a poor review. While the kibbles are not small in this food (about the size of a lima bean in length and half a grape in girth), and I do believe that this product is perfect for medium to large dogs, this is most definitely a quality dogfood. My lab-mix has suffered a great deal in the past from skin problems, and since changing to this food, he has improved 85%, and I am thrilled! Don't let a bad review dissuade you from trying this; it's great! And perhaps the small to teacup sized dogs could try the cat food in this brand, which my dog and cat love! The cat food kibble is the size of a small pea. To good health and happy feeding! :)

review/summary: Revised opinion
review/text: Update 11/12/11: I previously posted a review on the Simple Solutions Lamb & Rice Formula a few months ago, which I have since deleted.  I gave it a negative review because my dog, a miniature long-haired Dachshund, initially did not want to eat it. I would mix it with his old food, a good quality mostly all protein food (Orijen) that he loved--Orijen gets 6 stars at dogfoodanalysis.com, which is why I chose it. My dog would pick out the Orijen and leave the Simple Solutions in his bowl untouched.  However, my dog was getting constant ear infections that would not clear up with medication. I spent quite a bit on vet bills. I finally decided to try a different dog food to see if there was an allergy and tried Simple Solutions. As I said, initially he did not like it, but I continued to give it to him, and now he's eating it just fine.  When the Lamb & Rice almost ran out, I decided to try the Duck & Rice formula, which I'm slowly incorporating into the Lamb & Rice.  He really loves the Duck & Rice food and literally jumps up and down when he knows he going to be fed.  Also, the ear infections are completely gone.  I think this is an excellent food for dogs with sensitive stomachs or allergies, which apparently includes my dog.  I do wish some of the stores close to me would carry it though so I didn't have to purchase it online.  Fortunately, Amazon is selling it with free shipping, which was pretty fast also.<br /><br />I want to add that dogfoodanalysis.com only gives Wellness Simple Solutions 4 out of 6 stars because of the protein level, which is why I haven't given my review 5 stars. It states:<br />"Overall, we are happy with the quality of most of the ingredients in the food. The ingredient list is deliberately simple and designed for allergic dogs who may not tolerate a wide range of ingredients. We have concerns, however, at the apparently low level of meat content of the food."

review/text: I started a LID for my dog when after a regular yearly check up, my vet noticed that her paws were tinged a redish color. The vet said that it was probably an allergy to something in her food and suggested a limited ingredient diet. We have been using this food for about 4 months now and we have noticed remarkable results. She no longer constantly licks her feet and they are returning to their normal color. Worked perfectly for our dog!!

review/summary: Great for Dogs with Allergies
review/text: My dog is allergic to wheat and grain products. It would manifest as constant nasty ear inflamations. My vet prescribed a dog food that is only available from vets but after 3 months I saw no improvement.<br /><br />Finally I researched on my own and tried Wellness Simple Solutions and after 3 months I noticed that her ear problems subsided. I supplement her evening meals with the Wellness Simple Solutions dry food and she loves it.<br /><br />Compared with the stuff the vet prescribed, which looked like a waxy tube coming out of the can, the Wellness Simple Solutions canned dog food looks and smells like real food. It contains no wheat, corn, soy, dairy, or eggs and yet is high in nutrients.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the back of the can is duck and it states " This is a naturally preserved product". Considering that, I am very happy that the best by dates average about 2 years out because I keep extra dog food on hand in case of an emergency.

Since the switch almost 7 months ago, their coats are amazing - like silk and I have no shedding at all.  I have one dobe with a sensitive stomach so switched him over to this formula when I saw it came out.  He loves it - sure, its a little pricy but so worth it - no loose stools, no throwups and no shedding - I get comments on them all the time about how beautiful their coats are!

review/summary: Good food for sensitive dog
review/text: I've been feeding this dog food to my older female pug for several months now. In the fall of this year she began to experience allergy related skin and stomach issues. These allergies resulted in excessive licking and nibbling at her feet as well as occasional throwing up. She hasn't thrown up since she started eating this food, and overall her skin issues have lessened (that could be a result of the change in seasons as well). She is always excited to eat her food, but what pug isn't? I mean they're always hungry right? Also, as she never seems to drink enough water, I'm glad she's getting some moisture as part of this soft food as well. The only thing I find displeasing out this product is that we buy it in cases, and the cans frequently arrive dented. I wouldn't buy dented cans for my own food, for fear of the food being tainted in some way. So I feel a little nervous feeding my dog some of these dented cans. Oh well, she seems fine thus far and the smell and look of the food is fairly consistent, so we're going to stick with this food for now.

review/summary: not much better than I the salmon flavored one.
review/text: Obviously, any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies.  I switched from Wellness Simple Salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit/lab's fishy breath. If it wasn't for the fishy breath, I would have kept him on it. I was actually very pleased with the results of that food.  I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve.  His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks.  He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor.  We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea.  Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.<br /><br />Not quite sure what we're gonna do next. We might have to put our hyper allergic pit/lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him.

review/text: I am overwhelmed at how wonderful these things are. When I first saw these in the store, they were an impulse buy - never seen pumpernickel pretzels before, so I thought I'd try them. The subtle, yet present taste of pumpernickel - but with the combined taste of a pretzel - and the familiar pretzel texture. Nothing shy of totally awesome. The onion flavor is very subtle and doesn't end up leaving you with onion breath - just enough to give you flavor without spiking your sodium to the stratosphere. If you like pretzels, you should try these. No powdery residue as is sometimes present on alternatively flavored pretzels - just a hearty, easy to chew, nice snappy crunch pretzels.

These are really rye tasting and not really oniony, not overly salty and big enough that you can dip the braid into melted cheeses, dips or even cheese spread.  Sure beats regular chips and gives you a something different option for a pretzel. I got them at a significant savings and that closed the deal on these!

That helps it to fluff and work.  Do not try to just dump it in with a mix.  I fold in the egg replacer much like I would egg whites near the end of whatever I'm mixing.  It works great then--great for pancakes, cakes, and other similar baking things.  I've also used it in casseroles that call for eggs.

This product has been a great replacement in eggs for many baked items.

In more strongly flavored items there is no noticeable difference. I have served baked goods with this product to larger groups of people with rave reviews.<br /><br />I have tried to use this in other recipes that call for eggs, namely pad thai, and it did not work well.

review/text: This product works well in most scratch recipes, but does not work well in every boxed mix -- brownie mixes in particular just turn to goo.  I would like it much better if it came in a resealable canister of some kind.  I logged on to Amazon to buy a box for Christmas baking because I no longer live near a Whole Foods, but I will not be ordering it -- I pay less than $5 a box for it. This price is ridiculous.

review/summary: Chalky Taste
review/text: I don't use Ener-g on a regular basis since I think it gives things a chalky aftertaste, and I would much rather use a more natural egg replacement, like tofu, flax seeds, or applesauce, but I do always keep a box in my pantry to use in a pinch.

review/summary: Great for baked goods
review/text: I started using Egg Replacer for baking about 6 months go, when we discovered my son has an egg allergy.  It works great in pancakes, banana bread, cupcakes and cookies. I have not tried to make anything with it where egg is the main ingredient (like quiche or custard)...it seems like it wouldn't be great, but it is great for baking!

review/summary: egg replacer
review/text: I have used this product for more than a decade as a strict vegetarian. It works well for baked goods (i.e., cookies, pies, tarts, cakes, donuts, etc.). It is a replacement for eggs in baking goods (both sweet and salty); it is not intent to be used in scrambled eggs or Japanese style steamed egg custard.

review/summary: the price is outrageous
review/text: this particular price is double what we pay in the store. while the wife likes the product, it is not good for all situations in egg replacement. it is significantly better than red-mill brand. but the gouging on price just rings badly to my ear.
