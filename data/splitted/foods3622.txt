review/summary: Gu To Go
review/text: I have tried many gels also.  Gu gel is not my favorite, I actually prefer the consistency of PowerGel, but the variety pack offered by Gu makes me buy more.  PowerGel sells only 1 variety, and you end up with an entire box of the SAME gel.  I like Strawberry-Banana PowerGel and all, but 24 of them is a bit much.  For the most part, Gu gel is good tasting, and I agree that Espresso Love is the best.  The plain is ... well ... plain, but the chocolate and berry are also good.  Like I said, I prefer the consistency of PowerGel better because it is easier to get down when you are running and sucking on a gel packet, a little thicker.  If you haven't tried gels, Gu is a good start, and if you want a runnier gel, this may be the one for you.

review/summary: Best gel, Best flavor
review/text: Love this gel. I have tried all others, and I do like this the best. It gives me the energy output needed to keep going. The extra caffeine gives me a mental edge. The expresso flavor is great tasting even though I don't like expresso drinks.<br /><br />I tried it for the first time during the 2004 Columbus Marathon when they were handing it out. It helped me finish my first marathon.<br /><br />-unluckyrunner

review/summary: This probably saved me during the marathon.
review/text: In a nutshell:  Energy gel that keeps you going when going gets you tough. Well, until your knees give out or something.<br /><br />What it is:  It's an energy gel formulated for endurance athletes (never mind that not a lot of us who use the products like these will ever win a New York Marathon or something; if you participate, you're an athlete, right?)  I've got the Chocolate Outrage version, which has 32g of mixture containing various carbs, amino acid, and rather marginal amount of caffeine.  The price comes down to roughly $1 per pack, which might be a bit hard to swallow (no pun intended).<br /><br />What it's like:  It's a chocolatey paste that's easy to squeeze out and suck on from the pouch while running.  It recommends you to drink water while eating this; I recommend the same (and try for water instead of sports drink; water works better for washing this down).  I used this for my first (and last?) marathon, at the recommended pace of one pack 15 minutes before the race, and every 45 minutes of activity... it was cut closer to an hour than 45 minutes, as it does take some time to get absorbed to your body.  Thanks to it, I was able to finish the marathon despite my body basically refusing to run the last few miles.  If nothing else, I had the energy to go further, if not the joints.  And that's probably due to my inadequate training; this is no miracle worker in that it lets you do things you normally wouldn't do.  Or maybe it does... it's just that having the energy to do things doesn't translate to having the physical capacity to run ridiculous distances.<br /><br />Does it work?:  I think so.  But it doesn't seem to have replenished any electrolytes... so I guess you should use sports drink with this, after all.<br /><br />In conclusion:  these packs work wonders in keeps you going in the energy department--follow the instruction and I'm sure you won't bonk halfway through.  Don't forget to train, though!

review/summary: Great burst of energy when you need it
review/text: I have tried numerous products before trying Gu and was not happy with them.  I could not find any where I liked the flavor, consistency, or the burst of energy that I needed.  I bought a few Gu packets before a long run one day and really helped during the run.  I thought this was fluke, so I tried Gu for about a month on my long runs.  I found that I consistently do better with Gu than any other product.  While I don't care for the Chocolate flavor (like eating frosting), all the other flavores are very good.

review/summary: Long expiration, great price for a great product...
review/text: Expiration:<br />I'm always concerned about expiration dates when I order sale items in bulk from Amazon.  I ordered in August 2010, they arrived in two days via Prime shipping, and the expiration on them was 09/11.  That's 13 months away from expiration, if you're an endurance athlete that's plenty of time to go through several boxes (and if you're not, don't buy the marketing hype you won't need these gels anyway).<br /><br />Product Review:<br />These are a great product for a great price.  I got the 24 pack for $24.99 with free shipping, making them about $1.04 per pack.  They usually run between $1.50 to $2 a pack at sporting good stores.  Or you can stock up at marathon/tri expos for about $1 a pack.<br /><br />Everyone who uses these carbo gels has their own personal preference, I like the PowerGels best for their lighter texture.  The texture on these are between PowerGels (more watery) and Clifshots (much thicker).  But nothing new on race day...so I highly suggest you go to the store and buy 1 to see if you like the brand or the flavor before committing to a 24 pack.  If you do, then pull the trigger and stock up.  I highly recommend the price, product, and the expiration on them.<br /><br />Best of luck on your next race.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: I didn't know what to expect when I purchased these Energy Gel packs.  I intended to use one while walking a golf course for 4-5 hours for an added spurt of energy.  I didn't expect to get the shakes from the caffein content though.  Maybe for running a marathon I might suck down one entire pack, but I have scaled back to approx. 1/2 while walking the golf course.  I must say, the chocolate is "extremely" good.  Tastes like chocolate frosting or something equally yummy.  I recommend these for anyone needing a little boost while exercising...in moderation.  I would have preferred knowing the caffein content before I bought them, but through trial and error, I have found the dosage that works best for me.

review/summary: I love this pack
review/text: I wanted to pick up some Gu for Moutain Bike riding, but I had never tried it before, and wasn't sure what flavors would work well for me. I decided to go for this sample pack, which includes a rather large assortment that includes gels with or without caffeine and damn near every flavor I would have wanted to try. I have yet to find a flavor I truly despise, but some are definitely harder to swallow than others.<br /><br />It would be nice if Gu incorporated the "leash" to keep the tear off tabs from floating away (something cliff innovated on their packs). I thought this was a silly complaint until I started trying to leave the little tear off tab attached when gulping these on the trailside, it's just annoying.<br /><br />Other than the minor complain I love the flavor mixes and love Gu as a product.

review/text: I'm one of those people who has a stomach that just doesn't tolerate food while I'm exercising, which makes fueling before a race or just a training day a hassle to say the least. I'm also one of those people who is naturally skeptical of any "energy" product that comes out. I've tried a ton of those as well, mostly out of curiosity, including 5 hour energy. Nothing compares to GU Energy gels or the chewy bites, my stomach has no problem digesting these little wonder packets and the taste isn't bad either. I usually take 2 packets 30 minutes before a workout, or 1 packet of the bites, plus one gel packet if I need an extra pick me up (sometimes you don't have time for a cup of coffee). They work out great either way, as far as running long distance like over 25 miles, I've yet to use them, but some of the other reviewers seem to have experienced good results.

review/text: Ok, I am not a banana type of guy even though I know a banana is good on a long bike ride, but I can't stomach them. About 60 miles into the ride, I start to drag  and start wishing the ride was over.  Solid energy bars or even fig bars once again don't settle well with me an I experience zero positive effect.  I was skeptical  of gel but became a believer after  a friend gave me one about 60 miles into the ride.  This is the first energy 'fix' that I can say I noticed an immediate response.  I was enjoying the rest of the ride and riding strong . It then dawned on me that I was not wishing the ride to end!  The gel is easy on my stomach (as long as I drink plenty of water) and  is quickly assimilated.  The result is exactly what I would have wish for.  I recommend the Lemon lime because it's not heavy on the caffeine.  One more thing, much easier to carry than a banana.

review/summary: A marathon must have
review/text: Running longer distance races (half-marathon, full marathon, triathalons, ...) you need to stay energized.  Eating and exercising just don't mix well but if you don't eat something then you will "hit the wall" before completing your event.  Gu is a great way to go.  Packed with about 100 calories per packet they are easy to swallow, digest and they come in a wide variety of flavors that hopefully you will be able to find one that is palatable.  I prefer the Tri-berry myself and these I was able to pick up for about $1/packet including shipping.  Much better price than I can find at my local sporting goods store (when they even have them in stock!)

review/text: The Chocolate Outrage is my favorite -tastes just like chocolate frosting!  (I can't stomach most energy goos/bars)<br /><br />I ride (cycle) often and do a long 40-mile ride twice a month. I can notice a surge in energy and stamina a few minutes after savoring the chocolate gu (love it!) and my muscles have never had a serious hangover (I also drink Cyto-max on those long rides).<br /><br />I am a novice cyclist (My husband's the pro, and loves the Tri-berry flavor), and this stuff has helped me get through (and look forward to) some very tough rides.

review/summary: Quick Energy Kick
review/text: Gu gels provide a quick energy kick, are small enough to easily carry, particularly on long bike rides. Once you get used to the texture, they go down quickly; I particularly like the strawberry-banana flavor.

review/summary: Decent but needs an extra description
review/text: Gu is one of the best energy packs. It's tasty and it's well-designed for quick consumption (I find it less messy that Powerbar gels). This box of Gu is a great deal, how it would really help if it was mentioned in the description that over half of the packets are caffienated. I'm sure a lot of people would love the kick, but some people (like me) need to avoid caffiene due to preference or health conditions.

review/summary: Tasty energy for people on the run!
review/text: This year I used Gu Energy Gel as an aid for long training runs in preparation for a marathon and also during the marathon.  Every six or seven miles I'd ingest a pack along with some water and I noticed that I didn't seem to hit the proverbial wall as I had in previous marathons.  I wasn't the only runner using Gu as empty packs were strewn throughout the course.  The race organizers had an official Gu station at the fifteen mile mark.  As others have previously mentioned, the chocolate flavor Gu does taste like frosting and did indeed hit the spot.

review/summary: LOVE GU!
review/text: Just ran my first marathon in October and these were a godsend. Could definately feel the caffeine, electolytes, and carbs. Took them when I first felt fatigued, every 45 minutes to an hour, they kicked in just before I felt like I would collapse. Best boost ever. Use them on long runs, long bike rides, or when I workout and didn't eat much that day.

review/summary: Truly is sublime - the best flavor available
review/text: Taking down the GU Energy Gels comes down to two things: taste and texture.  In regards to tast, the Lemon Sublime is outstanding, in my opinion, and better than all others.  It's a familiar lemon lime flavor that will remind you of koolaid or gatorade.  A perfect sour blend.  As for texture, if you're a big fan of sinus infections, then you'll love the thick mucus texture of GU Energy Gels (just joking).  It's not really THAT bad, but it does take some mental toughness and a bit of conditioning.  I recommend putting it into the fridge about 5 minutes before taking it so it stiffens ever so slightly.  Otherwise you'll be running along and realize there is some GU still in between some teeth from the previous package several minutes ago.<br /><br />Some may wonder if there is an impact, an actual, tangible benefit from Gel intake.  To that I can unequivocally answer in the affirmative.  Depending on whether or not you burn fat or carbs while doing extended exercise, you may need to inhale one of these - with water as directed - more frequently than the directions indicate.  What seems to work best for me is 15-minutes prior to the run, and then every 35-40 minutes during the run.  So, just a little bit earlier than the normal schedule.<br /><br />The one significant downside to this product is the mess.  For long runs it's necessary to bring multiple GU packets.  Since getting out every last molecule is sometimes difficult while running, there's often a slimy surprise when reaching for the next packet.  And that mess is there when the run is completed as well.<br /><br />Overall, great product.

review/summary: Vanilla Orange - 3rd Best Flavor
review/text: Taking down the GU Energy Gels comes down to two things: taste and texture.  In regards to tast, the Vanilla Orange is better, in my opinion, than all but the Lemon-Lime and Jet Blackberry.  What that means is it's actually somewhat pleasant tasting.  Kind of mellow, with a hint of creamsicle.  I'd say the vanilla overpowers the orange somewhat.  As for texture, if you're a big fan of sinus infections, then you'll love the thick mucus texture of GU Energy Gels.  It's not really THAT bad (I'm just joking), but it does take some mental toughness and a bit of conditioning.

review/summary: Great for hiking
review/text: Started using Gu Energy Gels after a long hot day hike left me totally spent.  Not that these replace those valuable electrolytes, but the Gu gels will give you that boost for the last few hills.  These are convenient and store easily in a daypack or pocket.  Good price as these run about $1 more each in retail stores.  The gel is easy to get out while on the move and the taste is good-tolerable.  Only downside is that if you don't get all the gel out, it is a bit sticky on your hands.

review/summary: GU Energy Gels Work Great
review/text: My husband and son are both distance runners and compete in marathons and halfs.  They've been buying the GU gels at various running or cycling stores; but the convenience and value by getting them through Amazon Prime can't be beat...and they arrive at door in 2 days.  They generally prefer the fruit flavors for long training runs.  While my husband is a huge fan of peanut butter usually, he says that is not the taste he wants in his mouth when he's hot and tired.  At his last marathon in Quebec, other runners mentioned stringing a large safety pin through the tops of a few GU packs and then pinning onto the waistband of running shorts.  Then you can just tear off each GU as you need it.  My husband hasn't tried it yet.  When he's doing long training runs (16-22 mi), he generally wears a small hydration belt that has a pocket for the gels.  And gels were handed out at close intervals during the race.  With the safety pin idea, I'm not sure what you'd do with the used up pack.  Okay to toss on ground at races where there will be clean-up; but on training runs not too cool.

review/summary: Gu is good stuff!
review/text: A few months ago I originally purchased the strawberry banana flavor. I personally though the taste was awful and the texture was so thick it was disgusting. I couldn't even swallow it straight out of the package, I had to chew on it and swish it around my mouth with water and then force it down my throat. I let one of my friends try it and we had to stop the workout because the taste made him sick. However, the Vanilla flavor does NOT have any of those problems. The flavor is great and you can really taste the vanilla flavor. One of my friends thought it was a little on the sweet side but I love it. It is also a lot thinner, I can easily stick it in my mouth and gulp it down without wasting any time. Gu is good stuff, I can feel the difference on longer rides and it definitely helps me maintain my level of performance.

review/text: The 24 pack GU Gels are a great value considering how much you pay for each one individually.  You do give up the variety of buying one at a time, but since the vanilla bean is so delicious it is certainly not that much of a sacrifice.  GU Gels taste the least medicinal and are easy to keep down during the long runs.  Just make sure to have plenty of water to swallow them.

I use it during my half marathon training runs that are 7 miles or more and for the race itself. Great product. It's the only one I buy anymore.

review/summary: Great stuff!  Watch the caffeine!
review/text: I am a noob runner.  Just ran my first half marathon this past weekend.  I only used GU toward the end of my training during longer runs.  I noticed a big difference when I would use one GU during a 8+ mile run.  Had more energy!  Great stuff!  BUT BE CAREFUL with the GU with caffeine x2. (I love the flavor of the espresso love.  Kind of a caramel/coffee flavor.) I took three GUs during my 1/2.  One before -- 2 during. I had never taken that many before.  But according to the box the GU comes in, you are supposed to take more than usual for a race. I really should have tested this prior to my race! I was fine until mile 8 -- felt super.  Then -- POW!  Stomach PAIN!!  I had to slow way down.  I'm almost positive it was the caffeine.  I don't think of myself as someone with a sensitive stomach - but I was in pain ALL DAY after the race.  Even today (the day after) my tummy is tender.  So my suggestion -- BUY GU!  It's great stuff.  But play around with the different caffeine levels.  AND DON'T TRY SOMETHING NEW ON RACE DAY!!!!

The Lemon Sublime flavor is great and I take one 15 minutes before my runs and every 45 minutes during. You can use water, Gatorade or Powerade after taking them to wash them down. I also recommend drinking 2 or 3 16 oz of Ultra Fuel by Twin Labs for 2 to 3 days prior to long runs. This will top off your carb stores according to Tom Holland in his book Marathon Method. I believe in it and it kicks in around 13 miles !!!

review/summary: Fast and tasty energy!
review/text: I always used to think that all these energy products were a scam and they would give no energy while riding. But then one day I purchase a pack of GU espresso love from a local shop. I used the Gu 40 miles into a 70 mile ride. it was a hot day and I was feeling very tired. I took out the pack of gu opened it up and took a gulp. The consistency is kinda weird,but not bad. And what really surprised me was the taste. It tasted very nice and I actually liked it. After 10 minutes I was feeling much better and I felt more energetic. The gu helped me a lot and I easily made it to the end of the ride feeling fine. I have tried Hammer Gel espresso but it was a little too thick, but it did have a more "natural" taste. But I am sticking with this stuff, it really works.<br /><br />Only CON: You have to open the packet which might be a problem if you can't no hand or ride with one hand on a bike. Not a problem for me, but might be for some.

review/text: I've never needed to use these for energy as I never feel drained. But my brother recommended them, saying he takes one before and every half hour of his runs. I still haven't noticed a difference but when I start running over 14miles maybe I'll need it.

review/summary: Great for biking!
review/text: Gu seems to do a better job on the flavors than some of the other energy gels, and we love the Gu Vanilla!  Our boys love them for biking - it really keeps them going on longer rides, and of course they are great for racing because they go down so quickly.  The Vanilla (and all the flavors except banana) do have some caffeine from cola nut - the caffeine is 20 mg/packet (about 1/2 serving of Coca Cola), so take that into account if you are avoiding caffeine or don't want the youngsters to have it.

review/summary: Gluten Free Energy Gel
review/text: Athletes are very choosy when it comes to the foods that they eat. Their dietary regimen requires strict compliance to well balanced set of vitamins and minerals. Yet, they need sufficient energy to help them with their daily work-outs.<br /><br />Marathon runners are one of the athletes who require long lasting energy boosters. Energy bars are the popular choice for some because they can easily chew on it while taking their routine runs but I was fortunate to stumble on GU Energy Gel. Since then I made it possible to carry a bottle of it inside my gym bag because it provides instant release of energy boosting properties without any gluten contents.<br /><br />I am one of the many victims of gluten allergy. It is very inconvenient on my part since I have to stay away from products which have the slightest content of gluten in it if I don't want to be rushed to the hospital. I am also an occasional marathon runner (although I really want to become a professional runner but thanks to my chronic fatigue syndrome, it seems this will forever be my coveted dream.) I use Gene Eden Vir 101 to help suppress latent viral infection in my body. I am grateful to its manufacturers because it eases me of my CFS problems while giving long lasting energy to my body so I can cope with the daily challenges in my profession.<br /><br />GU Energy Gel does not only help me during marathon runs but even in my long hours office work as a paralegal. I store a bottle in my drawer in case I need a fast relief from sleepiness and the regulated caffeine content in it is enough to keep me awake. I know that my physician will not agree with my lifestyle but what can I do, am both a sport enthusiast and a responsible professional. I need to solutions that can keep me going! I have found the perfect combination: Gene Eden Vir 101 against latent chronic viral infection and long lasting energy plus GU energy level for immediate release of carbohydrate blend for my needs.

review/summary: Great Workout Addition
review/text: I trained for a marathon last year and used Gu Gel for parts of my training.  The label says "15 before and every 45".  I like to work out when I get home from work and if I'm already feeling hungry and a bit low on energy I'll take one before a workout and it helps me make it through.  On workouts longer than 45 minutes to an hour I take one along the way and again it helps on the tail end of the workout.  Where aerobically I might be fine but my legs just feel tired and sluggish Gu helps to alleviate the issue.  While I wouldn't eat Gu Gel for dinner, the Tri Berry is a decent enough flavor to enjoy during a workout.

review/text: I'm a recreational runner who has completed 3 half marathons in the last year. Not until the most recent one did I discover energy gels. I love the chocolate GU because it tastes like dessert!!! Be sure to drink a lot of water, though before your long run.

review/summary: Energy on the go
review/text: I haven't tried too many of the other gel products on the market, so this review may not have much context. However, the Gu gels have been great for my needs. I first tried the sampler pack, with a variety of gel flavors, and settled on the Espresso Love flavor. I'm currently training for the Chicago Marathon, and I've had Gu with me since my first "long" run of 6 miles. I recently finished a 20 mile run with 4 gels in my fuel belt, and I'll say that these things are a necessity for any run over an hour. The espresso flavor is pretty tasty and has a bit of a savory flavor. Recommended if you are a runner logging long miles.

review/summary: Long distance runners best friend
review/text: Ihad a chance to try almost all the energy gels, since a freinf of mine brought me every kind of gel as a gift pack. GU was my choice after this trial, due it's taste and boost. I' use them on long runs, longer than 20km. Every 45 mintues to 1 hour period is good to take a new one. '"Just Plain" taste is my favorite, since  don't like the flavours after a while. GU makes the best tasting gels, but after taking 3-4 packs, the taste disturbes me. So I decided to go on with plain test. Easy to carry on a fuel belt, easy to open and good to eat&drink. The only problem I have with GU is to import them over amazon to Turkey where I live. I solved this problem via a cargo forwarding system. I recommend this item to every runner and endurance athlet.

review/summary: Delicious--What a Shock!
review/text: Energy gels are kind of the unloved stepchild of the marathon world. You deal with them because you have to; they're sort of a necessary evil. But you sure don't look forward to choking them down! I have tried every sports gel I could get my hands on, searching for something that didn't feel like I was horking down some kind of disgusting fruit sludge.<br /><br />I ordered this flavor online because it's impossible to find in stores. Someone described the flavor as tasting like chocolate frosting, and that is exactly what it tastes like. After 15 miles on the road with another 11.2 left to run, a little chocolate frosting is quite a pick-me-up. Add in all the energy-enhancing ingredients, and it's the perfect energy gel. I cannot stress enough how wonderful the flavor is, or how well it works as a nutrient and energy boost. Treat yourself. Thank me later.

review/text: I have tried all of the different types of gels; Powerbar, Clif Shots, Hammer Gels, etc.  I always come back to Gu as my favorite and this last purchase was especially important as I was preparing for an Ironman 70.3 triathlon.  I used both the Strawberry Banana and the TriBerry (w/ caffeine) and used 9 for the race.  Yes that is right 9!  I have to say most people compain about the taste after awhile, but I did not mind at all.  I took them when I needed a pick me up (1 before the race - 1.2 miles, 5 on the bike - 56 miles, and 3 on the run - 13.1 miles.)  They worked great especially on the run.  When using Gu's for a race of this distance, always use two different flavors and one with caffeine and one without and alternate the flavors.  It worked for me.

review/text: I read about GU as a sport supplement (like Gatorade) but I immediately thought about my diabetic husband who has trouble with his blood sugar dropping too low when he exercises.  We got it for him to try out and it is wonderful.  There is nothing else he's found to bring him back as quickly from a sugar low.  He now carries one in his pocket when we head out for our 6 mile walk.  He also keeps one in each of the cars and his briefcase.  There is no comparison between those glucose tablets they sell for diabetics and GU.  GU gets him feeling better within 15 minutes- he swears the glucose tabs don't work for him at all.  And it comes in an amazing array of flavors.<br /><br />GU is great! If you or someone you love is a diabetic who is plagued with going low- I highly recommend you try it out.

To me, it's the most refreshing during or after a long run. It's light and has enough flavor without being overbearing or heavy tasting.<br /><br />I like the GU Gels in general because they have less sodium than other sports/endurance foods I've seen on the market, and while some extra sodium is good during long runs and other distance endeavors, I am watching my sodium for health reasons, so GU gels are a good compromise for me.

review/summary: GU Rocks, but something else rocks more
review/text: I've been using GU for a long time, 10 years or more, and I think it's a wonderful product.  However, I have noticed that when I'm consuming multiple ones during a race and such, they start to taste sweet, which I don't like at all;  the last thing I want when I'm 20 miles into a run is something sweet.  I thought all gels were pretty much the same, but alas, I now know that that's not true.<br /><br />I have recently discovered another product, gel from Hammer Nutrition.  Their flavors are superior (to me anyway), and they're not overwhelmingly loaded with sugar.  Also, after you take one you're not scrambling for the water bottle since they don't leave a syrup consistency in your mouth.  If you're only going to use 1 gel, then GU can fit the bill, but if you're going to consume multiple ones, you might want to look at the gel from Hammer Nutrition.<br /><br />Oh, about the carbs and sugar content.  There are more simple carbs in the GU gels, which means that it brings you up and down much faster.  Hammer gels have a great deal more complex carbs in them (and they're natural), so you don't spike up and drop down fast, meaning that you give your body a consistent supply of energy without the spikes.  This has been a nice change in my training.<br /><br />FYI, the flavors of GU I like are the Mint Chocolate and Vanilla.  For Hammer gels, I like the Huckleberry, Raspberry, and Apple Cinnamon.

review/summary: Bold robust flavor. Refreshing for all occasions, great for colds and weight loss!
review/text: Red Zinger is the tea that made Celestial Seasonings famous.  This was the must-have tea in the seventies.  Every well stocked hippie cupboard had to have this tea next to the brown rice and soy sauce.<br /><br />The ingredients are healthy and tasty, and blend into a tasty ruby potion that smells lemon-mint tart. Red Zinger is especially good for colds--the ingredients strengthen the immune system and the tea is soothing to the throat. It is also great for a diet tea--the bold flavor helps with cravings and the diuretic ingredients prevent and ameliorate water retention. And aside from its benefits it is just a delicious tea! The flavor is sour-cherry with a hint of mint and flavorful hot or cold.<br /><br />Hibiscus is the first ingredient.  First consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Hibiscus tea has diuretic qualities, can lower blood pressure, and has minerals and flavonoids.  The second ingredient, rose hips, are very high in vitamin C and are used in herbal medicine to prevent urinary tract infections.  Other ingredients include peppermint, lemon grass, orange peel, lemon myrtle, licorice and wild cherry bark.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Passion colors all that it touches in its own hues."  Baltasar Gracian.

review/summary: Red Zinger Tea.....the BEST of Celestial Seasoning Teas
review/text: My husband and I have been drinking this tea for over twenty years and of all of the Celestial Seasoning Teas it is our favorite tea, the mellow sweetness, the blend of hibiscus and other flavors make it a great ice tea mix too. I can't figure out why all of the markets we frequently visit have stopped carrying this particular tea (RED ZINGER).

review/summary: Perfect when you have a cold
review/text: This is a classic Celestial Seasonings tea which is a staple in my pantry.  It can be overly acidic to some, but when I have a cold there's nothing like it.  Here's my special toddy recipe:<br /><br />Red Zinger steeped for 4 minutes<br /><br />1 generous tsp honey<br /><br />juice of 1/2 lemon<br /><br />jigger of dark rum<br /><br />This will cure what ails ya! Truly, the Red Zinger and lemon clear the mucous, the honey soothes the throat, and the rum quiets the cough.

review/summary: It's a zinger and a half!
review/text: So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the teas in the "zinger" series. I like Celestial Seasonings in general. Of course, the tea bags have no strings and that is something of an annoyance, but other than that, the teas are tasty and enjoyable. Zinger really is a great description of the product. It has a surprising and deeply flavorful taste and an aroma to match. The lemon has a fresh, rich lemon flavor. The raspberry embodies the flavor of raspberry as well. The Red Zinger, however, is the best of them all.  I have yet to find a better tea in the series.  I would give it 4.5, but Amazon only allows integers.  There are some teas that I have tasted that are better, but only rarely.  It is a great option for those who enjoy herbal teas.

review/summary: Red Zinger Herb Tea:  The Perfect Pick-Me-Up
review/text: A really refreshing beverage - perhaps the best discovery since lemonade!  Red Zinger is deep red in color, and has a delicious flavor all its own. Hibiscus flowers give it a smooth taste, enhanced with overtones of peppermint, lemon, orange and cherry. It's a bit reminiscent of fruit punch, only not as sweet and much more satisfying.  We began using it as a substitute for black tea, because we were trying to cut out caffeine and didn't like the constant battle with brown stains on our teeth.  Red Zinger turned out to be the perfect answer.<br /><br />Our family enjoys this tea iced and sweetened with turbinado sugar.  It's a favorite with my kids and a staple in our household.  I believe it helps keep us healthier, too...we've had fewer winter colds since we've been drinking it on a regular basis. It contains rosehips and wild cherry bark, both of which are known for their immune-system boosting benefits. Suggested use:  Brew 6 tea bags per half gallon of tea, or 3 per quart, and sweeten to taste.

review/summary: An Old Favorite
review/text: For some reason, it is very hard to find Red Zinger at local stores. Celestial Seasonings seems to be introducing new "Zingers" and forgot about the one that started it all.<br /><br />Nice tasty tea and buying it on Amazon was a joy with free, quick shipping.
