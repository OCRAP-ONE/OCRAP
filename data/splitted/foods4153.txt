review/summary: These are a life saver!
review/text: My nearly 9 year-old golden retriever has been taking allergy meds since he was 18 months old.  For years he was fine with me rolling the capsule in some american cheese, then one day, out of the blue, he somehow "realized" there was medicine inside the cheese and refused to eat it.  Shortly thereafter, I discovered Pill Pockets, and they've been a godsend.  Aside from the large capsules he takes every day for allergies, every time he has to take another medication it's a piece of cake.  He never tires of them, and, like another reviewer said, always looks at me as if to ask "what?  you're only giving me ONE??"  Teddy loves both flavors and yes, while they're a bit expensive, if you've ever tried to force a pill down a dog's throat, you'll find ways to make room in your budget for Pill Pockets. :-)

review/text: I know the product say these are for pill and capsules, but the are also great for liquids.  I have a minpin who would attack the dropper and I would bet that he wasn't getting anywhere near a full dose of his medication.  So I tried mixing it with food. Still a no go. Out of desperation I took the change that these would work, and they do.  You just need to make sure you leave enough space at the top to be able to seal them properly.  For me... 1 ml of fluid takes two capsule sized pill pockets.

review/summary: Easy way to get my dog to take a pill
review/text: My dog was on an antibiotic that could not be wrapped in cheese (no dairy) and without the cheese he spits and coughs pills back out.  My vet gave me a weeks supply of these pill pockets (2 pills 2x a day) to try as they contain no dairy.  My dog liked them so much he thought they were a treat, he needed to stay on the medicine for a month, so I order this product and went through almost 2 bags.<br /><br />Not messy, not stinky easy to use.

review/text: Based on another reviewer I tried the cat pockets for my Rat Terrier. The price was half based on the packet having many more and being lower.  My dog likes the salmon and the chicken just fine. The 6 pack is the best price. Giving him his pill every day is so much easier now.  I had tried for ages to cover it in the doggie cheese whiz and that was just nasty and he often licked off the whiz and left the pill.  Tricky little dog. ;-) Wish I had found these sooner.

review/summary: For more economical choice, check out Pill Pockets for CATS
review/text: I have a 100lb dog, an Akita who HATES taking pills. She has NOT had Pill Pockets for Dogs, but she HAS had Pill Pockets for CATS. Now, before you click the "No" button after "Was this review helpful to you?", read further -- my comments will be of value to those with dogs that take SMALL pills!<br /><br />Andie has been taking pills for hypothyroidism for the past 9 years. Her pills are TINY. Wrapping them in meat or cheese never worked; she simply ate around the pill or spit it out. For years the only way I could get Andie to take pills was to, literally, shove them down her throat. (My hands are small enough and her mouth is big enough for me to do this. Thankfully she's a very trusting dog!)<br /><br />Then one day I was at the vet and noticed packages of something called "Pill Pockets". They had two kinds -- one for dogs and one for cats. Both came in flavors that Andie would like, but the dog Pill Pockets came in different sizes (small and large) while the cat Pill Pockets only came in one size (small).<br /><br />I looked at each package very carefully and noticed that the packages for cats had 45 Pill Pockets, while the packages for small dogs only had 35 Pill Pockets. And yet, the packages for small dogs cost MORE than the packages for cats -- huh? (On Amazon.com they are the same price, but the quantities are different.) So I looked at Andie's tiny thyroid pills, then looked at the Pill Pocket pictures on the packages and decided, "I might as well save myself a buck and buy the kitty Pill Pockets. What the hey, Andie won't know she's eating something intended for cats!"<br /><br />I've been happy with that decision ever since.<br /><br />I've bought both the salmon- and chicken-flavored Pill Pockets FOR CATS and Andie likes them both. The pockets are the perfect size, just big enough for her thyroid pills, and to date she has gulped down every one, then begged for another! And I like the fact that I get 10 more in each package than I would if I bought the Pill Pockets "for dogs".<br /><br />Pill Pockets are GREAT product, for cats OR dogs. I wish I had discovered them sooner! While I have never used the Pill Pockets for Dogs, I am 100% confident that they are excellent. That's why I'm giving this product 5 stars. If Andie's pills were bigger I would get the Pill Pockets for Dogs, and I know she would like them just as much. For the time being, though, I will stick with the smaller Pill Pockets for Cats, since they last a few days longer.<br /><br />So, this review is to pass along an idea that perhaps some dog owners had not considered: If your dog takes tiny pills like Andie does, go with the more economical choice and get Pill Pockets for Cats. Your dog will never know the difference!

review/summary: The 28th Five Star Review
review/text: Rarely have I encountered a product that doesn't have at least ONE person who either thinks it's junk, or gives a (bogus) low review because the delivery guy accidentally dropped the package before leaving the item at the door.<br /><br />As of this moment, 100% of the people reviewing the Greenies PILL POCKETS have given them a five-star rating, and I'm enthusiastically joining the crowd!<br /><br />If you're a dog owner, you've almost certainly had to, at some point, give your dog a pill that he or she was reluctant to take. The usual remedy until now, (as suggested by our vet) was to simply shove the thing down the poor dog's throat, and then rub their neck to help the pill go down.<br /><br />Recently, one of our dogs --a large yellow lab named Chip-- was suffering from untreatable throat cancer, but he still needed to take a number of pills to make his final days a little more comfortable. The vet specifically mentioned AVOIDING the "shove and rub" technique as it would be very painful for the dog --who at that point was even reluctant to eat his regular food.<br /><br />Someone mentioned PILL POCKETS. We picked up a bag and lo and behold, they worked like a champ. Though Chip was still not really interested in eating a meal, the *very* meaty smell of the PILL POCKETS was irresistible to him, and he happily gobbled up his meds.<br /><br />Sadly, we lost Chip about a week later, but then our other dog developed a minor skin rash that required he take some antibiotics. Eubie is a Border Collie, and they tend to figure things out before you do --and we were astounded when he wolfed down his medicine and then looked at us as if to ask "is that all --when do I get another?!"<br /><br />My technique for using the PILL POCKETS is to stuff the pill(s) inside, pinch off the open end --and then, using my palms, "roll" the pocket into a smooth, round ball. With Eubie at least, he loves the smell so much, that he simply swallows it whole.<br /><br />In fact, I discovered another great use for the PILL POCKETS and that is to take a rawhide bone and smear the nooks and crannies with a single pill pocket. Since they're kind of "doughy" in texture, they're perfect in this regard --and for a dog that will happily walk around the house with the rawhide bone for days without ever chewing on it, we've found that the "pill pocket infused" rawhide is something that he HAS to chew on. (In fact, he was SO focused on this task, that for the first time ever, he actually ignored the fireworks on July 4th.... it was truly amazing!)<br /><br />- Jonathan Sabin

review/summary: Pillpockets are a Lifesaver
review/text: My dog Andy requires 3 pills 3 times a day. I started using Pillpockets almost two years ago. We have used the dreaded pill popper for many years. When the popper comes out, Andy beats a hasty retreat. We all hated it, as a lot of times the pills popped out, stayed in the popper, or he gagged on them. Since he had to have pills three times a day, it was a daily ordeal. It all changed when we tried Pill Pockets. He now looks forward to taking his pills. He loves the taste of the Pillpockets, I don't think we can now do without them. He likes them so much, we use them as treats for special occasions. They have made treating Andy a pleasant experience, rather than a ordeal. I wish I would have invented them.

review/summary: Veterinary approved...
review/text: As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets.  I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling.<br /><br />Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those "duh" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent.  Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least.<br />My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of "treat."  It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it "makes pills a treat to give!"<br /><br />The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger "capsule" dog Pill Pockets.<br /><br />The cons:  One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!<br /><br />Dr. Justine Lee, DVM, DACVECC<br />Author of "It's a Dog's Life... but It's Your Carpet" and "It's a Cat's World... You Just Live In It"<br />[...].

review/text: My dog has to take seizure pills and after 2 months of shoving them down her throat and finding the pills around the house, I saw Pill Pockets at the vet. She likes them, the pills don't get spit out, and I don't get growled at, it's great! The pills are tiny, so I split one pill pocket up and can wrap four pills up. I put the extras in an empty pill bottle to keep them fresh. She doesn't mind the smaller size. They do leave your hands kind of greasy though.

This bag contained product that was slippery, crumbly and they are not pliable like original Greenie's!  The texture of these pockets is totally different from original Greenie's PP and they could NOT be squeezed around a pill - the product breaks apart.  I know the difference because I've been using real Greenie's for month's to hide medicine from my 13 year old dog.  I will NOT purchase this product from Amazon again as I believe they are are knockoffs.  Who knows what's in them, and with recent information about poisonings I'm not taking a chance with MY dogs!

She was so sick and had little appetite so was not interested in the cheese or other stuff I tried to hide the pills in.  The vet suggested these.  She loved them and would just about take a finger off when I would give them to her.  Now we are using them for house training treats.  They are very soft so you can pinch the tiniest bit off as a reward without giving a big, hard biscuit that she doesn't much like anyway.

review/text: I tried to give my Pomeranian her meds with every treat/food that I knew she loved to no avail.  Tried to force them down her throat, they came back up.  It was impossible.  She knew I was trying to hide pills.  I was so frustrated I was going to have to take her to the vet so they could give her the pills.  They told me about pill pockets and I was amazed that she would eat them with a pill inside.  They are truly the key to getting a dog to swallow a pill.

review/summary: Best thing ever invented!
review/text: I have dogs that are very food motivated...until you put medicine in it. I don't know how they know, but they do, and always eat right around the pill. UGH! So frustrating, because then I have to shove them down their throat. It hurts their feelings, it hurts my feeling and I dread doing it.<br /><br />That was until I found pill pockets. My dogs LOVE them and actually run to the kitchen when they smell that I am "preparing" them. The smell is pretty strong, so I am unsure if they cannot smell the pills or the pill pockets taste so good, they just don't care. Either way is fine for me - this product has alleviated stress for me. Which is a relief, because just the stress of having sick dog(s) can be overwhelming. I am so thankful for this product!<br /><br />As always, Amazon has the product at a great price - beating the vet by several dollars.

review/summary: No more fighting with the dog about his pills!
review/text: These things are AWESOME! I've tried giving my dog his pills in everything from cheese- to sandwich meat- and finally liverwurst- all of which worked... for a while. Eventually though he would start chewing whatever it was to locate the medication in whatever treat it was and spit the pills out. Over And Over. SO frustrating. He has three pills to take twice daily and I can fit all three of them in one Greenie... These pill pockets actually have him reminding ME that it's time to take them.  Of course you could try something else that's cheaper- and I've done that- but when you find you're spending too much time fighting your best friend to treat a chronic condition and keep him with you- reach for these. They are worth every penny! There's no more fighting-, and no sad-dog hiding under the furniture.

I would recommend it to anyone in the same situation.  The alternative of finding scraps to bury the pills in is most likely to provide the pet with food that is not good for them.

review/text: I couldn't get my dog to take her incontinence pill (which is supposed to be a chewable). Put it in a hotdog, she would eat around the hotdog & spit the pill out. Same with any other type of food, food gone, pill left on the floor. Wrapped the pill in one of these pill pockets & she doesn't even chew, she wolfs it down so quickly. Now my only problem is getting the pill in the pocket fast enough so that I don't have to clean up a puddle of drool.

review/text: Pill Pockets may be the best product of any kind I've ever bought, including my first WalkMan. After months of jamming two pills down my poor cat's throat, I learned about Pill Pockets and thought I'd give them a try. Instant success. They're just the right size for the pills, and Dexter was immediately attracted to the Salmony-fresh scent. He swooped right in to gobble up his medicine. Since he'll have to take these pills for the rest of his life, Pill Pockets are perfect.

review/text: The Greenies I recently ordered here are working out great, for my dog who needs his thyroid meds.  He's usually pretty eager for any treat, though sometimes a little bit picky -- LOVES these, though.<br /><br />We have another dog that is extremely hard to 'fool' with meds, and Greenies didn't work for her.  So, it does depend on the dog, but Greenies probably work for most.

I only found out about them when I mentioned that giving my cat a pill is not fun.  The receptionist gave me a couple to try.  The cat swallowed that thing so fast, and loved it.  Every vet should offer these routinely when they prescribe pills to cats and dogs.  It really makes life so much easier for me and for my pet!  I'm ordering some from Amazon so I have them on hand for the future.

review/summary: Works like a charm even for smart and/or finicky dogs
review/text: First, Pill Pockets are a GREAT product that really works... before Pill Pockets, I only had a 50% success rate getting any of our dogs to take their pills when we used hotdogs and even steak leftovers. With Pill Pockets, the pill always goes "down"!<br /><br />Pill Pockets are like Beef Playdoh, and are easy to tear into pieces. There is no need to use a whole pill pocket for a pill or capsule if the capsule or pill is small... just use enough pill pocket to cover the pill/capsule and fool your pet.  For instance, we tear each pill pocket in half and wrap that half around the dog's medication.  By the way, the size listed on the Pill Pocket bag indicates the size of the pill pocket, not the dog. Large meds require larger Pill Pockets; small meds like phenobarbital (for seizures) require only the small pill pockets or perhaps a piece of a large pill pocket.<br /><br />By the way, please DON'T waste your money buying Pill Pockets for cats if you have dogs. The reason I point this out is that I read a review (listed under another seller) that stated that it was more economical to buy the PillPockets for cats because you receive 45 instead of 35. Well, the reviewer failed to notice that the Pill Pockets for Cats only weighs 1.8 ounces, and the Pill Pockets (Small bag) for Dogs weighs 3.5 ounces! Buy the bag that, per ounce, is the least money.

She actually slides across the tile that last few inches.<br /><br />These pill pockets are soft, moist, and REALLY stinky. Everything that a dog has ever wanted in a treat. I don't think there's a dog on this planet that won't eat these. Get them and you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Stress free administration of pills
review/text: After a failed attempt at forcing a pill down our new greyhound, in which he spewed dissolved pill all over us and our kitchen floor, we found Greenies.  My  husband was skeptical and expecting the worst, since we had unsuccessfully tried to hid the pill in yogurt and in dog food.  To the touch, the treat reminds me of the consistency of a fresh chewy brownie.  It was easy to insert the pill and squeeze the opening closed.  Our dog loved the treat and ate it without any problem.  Now when he hears me opening the bag he comes running to get his pill, oh I mean treat!  This is an excellent product that I plan to keep on hand.

review/text: Our dog is a little weird with food. He had a rough start in life prior to us getting him so now he's terrified of eating food in front of us. It's been a real trial to get him to eat treats at times but he gobbled this up right in front of us. We were really impressed. The pill fit in just fine and sealed off great. It's really stinky (in a dog approving kind of way) and I think you'll be hard pressed to find a dog who won't eat it.<br /><br />If our dog will eat it pill and all, any dog will.

I like this better then using lunchmeat or peanut butter because we keep the pills in a pill case and we can put the pill in the pill pocket and put the whole thing in the M-F pill case.

review/summary: Awesome for dog & safe for toddler
review/text: We used to put our dog's pills in his food dish and most of the time he would just eat them. That is not safe not that we have an almost toddler in the house in case the dog leaves a pill behind and the baby eats it. The dog LOVES these pill pockets and we love knowing our baby is safe from the dogs meds.

review/text: Our vet recommended Pill Pockets for a very intelligent dog who is on multiple meds- she can sniff out a pill in anything, cheese, peanut butter - etc, and spit them out.  But now, pill pockets are a treat - and 3 x per day she loves that green foil bag- Product is safe and soft enough to use piecemeal for small pills and capsules.  Remarkable help for capsules, and pills of all sizes!

review/summary: Pill Pockets work Great!
review/text: Our large dog (75 lbs) hates pills and even with putting them in the back of his mouth and holding his mouth closed and massaging his throat, he still manages to mostly spit out the pills. Pill Pockets are a godsend. I simply put the pill into the pocket, form the pocket completely around the pill, pop it into his mouth and he happily chews and swallows. Highly recommended for giving pills to pets.

review/summary: GREAT PRODUCT, but DO NOT buy Pill Pockets for CATS if you have DOGS!
review/text: First, Pill Pockets are a GREAT product that really works... before Pill Pockets, I only had a 50% success rate getting our three dogs to take their pills when we used hotdogs and even steak leftovers.  With Pill Pockets, the pill always goes "down"!  But DON'T waste your money buying Pill Pockets for cats if you have dogs. I read the review that stated that it was more economical to buy the PillPockets for cats because you receive 45 instead of 35.  Well, the reviewer failed to notice that the Pill Pockets for Cats only weighs 1.8 ounces, and the Pill Pockets (Small bag) for Dogs weighs 3.5 ounces! BUY the SMALL PILLPOCKETS FOR DOGS!  The Pill Pockets are like Beef Playdoh, and are easy to tear in half (we tear each one in half and wrap 1/2 around my dog's seizure medication).  So for the best ECONOMY, buy the Pill Pockets for Dogs (PS - the Pill Pocket's size indicates the size of the pill, not the dog.  Large meds require larger Pill Pockets; small meds like phenobarbital require only the small).  These things are Great!

review/text: WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  I was so impressed with this product, I just wrote a letter to the company (S & M NuTec)that developed and make them, telling them how thrilled I am.  I've got 3 elderly dogs all on daily medications ( two are on oral chemotherapy, one on Thyroid, one takes Arthritis Medications and one is on Antibiotics)....and they actually LOOK FORWARD to getting their pills!!!  I started out giving them an empty pouch or two then the one with a pill in it....and after the 3rd day, I didnt need the empty pouchs.<br /><br />No more wasted, half dissolved pills or capsules found in corners, no more dragging them out from under the kitchen table, no more cleaning the pill syringe after every use, no more prying open jaws.  NO MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS INFLICTED ON MY ELDERLY POOCHES ON A DAILY BASIS.<br /><br />I buy the LARGE size and cut them in half, then mold the pill around it, so I get 60 pieces out of the Large 30 chew bag.<br /><br />I see they now have Chicken available and will be ordering some of them too. THIS IS A MUST HAVE PRODUCT for Dog and Cat owners.

I did an internet search and found out about pill pockets.  I didn't buy from Amazon because I needed them right away, I paid $13 at Petco.  They are a lifesaver, we have the beef flavor and he eats it right up.  He loves them.<br /><br />Since the antibiotics will use up almost the whole bag I'm putting in an order through Amazon for more pill pockets to keep on hand.

review/summary: Worst smelling treat for dogs
review/text: My puppy loves Greenies pillpockets as a regular treat. When I first discovered this, it was at the vet's office and they used the beef flavored ones. Eventually, I decided to see how she would like the Duck and Pea flavor but when I opened the bag the odor from these treats made me, my roommate, and my boyfriend gag. Even the dog was less excited--and she loves (and I mean LOVES) the beef pill pockets. I set out one of each just to see what she'd go for and my vacuum cleaner of a dog went straight for the beef. She'll eat the duck one, but only if that's the only thing available. I had planned on trying the chicken flavor at some point too, but after this I think we'll be sticking with beef.

review/text: The pill pocket was way too large for the pill, and my crafty dog figured out right away how to get the pill out and eat the treat.  The pill pocket itself was overly oily and had a heavy smell that was difficult to wash off my hands after I handled the product.  After using two pockets -- and not getting a pill into my pooch, I threw away the rest of the bag.  Great idea, but a useless, ineffective, and nasty product.  If you want your dog to swallow pills without a fuss, roll the pill in homemade peanut butter paste (organic peanut butter and nutritional yeast); low-cost, easy clean up, and 100% success rate!

review/summary: BEWARE: terrible flavor of usually good product line
review/text: It looks as if the previous reviews are all for Pill Pockets in general, which are a great product for dogs.  This flavor variety, though, is horrible, judging by the packet I was sent.<br /><br />I opened the package, and they smelled exactly like (forgive the imagery) diarrhea.  And strongly.  I thought someone had had an accident until I realized where it was coming from.<br /><br />I thought maybe it was a flavor dogs like. You never know.  Some cheese smells bad too.  My poor dog spit it out and gagged when I fed it to him.<br /><br />This is either a very misguided flavor attempt, or the completely sealed package somehow went rotten (not a good sign), or they filled it with rotten product at the packaging stage (also not reassuring).<br /><br />Sickening, horrible, unfit to be put in the trash.  Had to flush it.

review/text: Giving pills on a daily basis at an animal shelter, I have found that these provide no advantage over either breaking up the pill and mixing it in with canned food, or pushing the pill into a chunk of meat (in chunky canned food).  Some crafty dogs eat the pill pocket away from the pill and leave the pill untouched.  I suggest mixing pills in with something with a strong odor and flavor.  One trick is to push the pill into a bit of hotdog--no dog can resist that.

review/summary: Complete failure with my dog
review/text: My dachshund recently needed to start taking pills three times a day. He figured out there were sometimes pills in hot dog pieces (something to try nonetheless) so he began carefully checking each piece and spitting out the pills. So I tried Pill Pockets. The first one worked, and that was the last time. He won't even taste them now. So for me, Pill Pockets were expensive and ineffective. I now cook him up some chicken hearts and conceal the pills inside every day as needed while he isn't looking, then trim them down to barely cover the pill. I get him excited by quickly feeding him the trimmings, followed up by the main piece with the pill inside. On occasion he still finds them, but he likes chicken so much that it works quite well, so far, anyway.<br /><br />Obviously Pill Pockets work very good for most people, but not for me and my dog.

review/text: My 1-year-old Shih Tzu, Missy, was recently diagnosed with a skin infection and allergies, so the vet prescribed an antibiotic and an allergy med twice a day.  At first, I thought it was going okay with my hiding the pills in a piece of banana or cheese...but then, I started finding pills all over the place...she'd been appearing to eat the food while in front of me and then going elsewhere to spit out the pills!<br /><br />I was seeing my money go down the drain as these antibiotics and allergy meds went anywhere (including staining my carpet!) but IN HER TUMMY!  Finally, a friend who has a cat suggested pill pockets, so I ordered a small packet of these beef flavored ones to see if they would work.<br /><br />WELL!  She not only takes her meds now, but she BEGS for them as soon as she sees me open the package of pill pockets!  I am FINALLY seeing her skin clear up because the pills are FINALLY getting into her system...today I gave her a bath and her skin is clear!<br /><br />My only issue with the pill pockets (the ONLY reason I gave them 4 stars vs. 5) is that they are very soft and mooshy...I guess this is necessary so that you can mold the pill pocket around the pill, regardless of its shape or size...but I find it a little yucky.  A few months ago, I may also have complained about the VERY strong smoky smell (like beef jerky), but I've gotten used to that via some treats Missy that loves.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering these again...in a larger quantity!

I purchased both the roasted duck, which is for allergies, and chicken flavored pockets and tried out both of the sizes (pockets for tablets and capsules) as well. My dog much preferred the chicken flavor. I preferred the pill pockets in the capsule size. This is because these pockets are larger. Even though the tablet sized pockets are large enough for any tablet, the capsule size allow me to get twice as many pill pockets for my money. I split them in two and can still fit a tablet inside each half*... just a TIP for those wanting to save a bit of $

Pill Pockets has an oily texture that she can just gulp right down.

The dog has a little sealed pouch of treat to eat. The large size can be cut in half for smaller dogs like our paps.<br /><br />If you have to give pills to your dogs and they are no longer fooled by the lump of peanut butter or the hotdog...

Then went to<br />thirds with no problem and now am on a quarter<br />of the pocket still with no problem. You just have to<br />manipulate it by spreading it around over the pill<br />(and its a large pill). Now I have 120 pockets from<br />30.

review/summary: Great for stubborn, pill needing dogs!
review/text: I have always loved these for giving pills to my dogs.  My Border Collie mix takes 4 pills a day, and this has been the only thing he will swallow with pills in it.  He's smart enough to chomp on whatever else I try and then spit the pill back out.  These, however, work great.  I wish I had read the product description closer, my fault.  This is only the 25 count.  I can get 30 for only a couple dollars more locally, so will probably just do that in the future.  Shipping was fast and my dog loves them, so its still a win.  Highly recommend them, as my dog sometimes has a sensitive stomach to treats and certain people foods.  He can take the beef or chicken ones, as well.

review/summary: these things are amazing
review/text: These things are amazing.  I wish someone would have invented them years ago.  all you do is slip the dogs medicine into the hole and give them the treat.  My dogs never even notice in there.  We use them daily.

review/summary: This *may* give your dog diarrhea, but they do their job.
review/text: My dog is 12, and has had constantly firm stool his whole life.  After a dental surgery, I used these, and assume the medicine was giving him diarrhea.  After he was better, and no more pills... I was still using these leftover pockets to smear into an old hollow bone (they are very pliable and many are cracked and smoooooshed, already, prior to opening the package), and he continued to have diarrhea.  I was just worried something happened due to the mediciation, but finally put two and two together.  Googling these pill pockets, diarrhea is a side effect.  So be aware.  These work well for the pill part, but the drawbacks are there too.<br /><br />Also, I haven't talked about diarrhea this much in my whole life.  I have heard the only time it's good to have diarrhea is in scrabble, because it's worth a crapload of points. I saw someone on Twitter ask Greenies if Diarrhea was a side effect.. the question is hilarious: [...]<br /><br />Anyhoo... we love our dogs.  We hate messy poop.  There may be better ways.  Making the poopy that loose makes me think it can't be too healthy?

review/summary: Great for Dogs on Hypoallergenic Diets
review/text: I have been extremely satisfied with the Greenies Pill Pockets Roasted Duck and Pea Formula. To clarify, this is the same as "Allergy Formula" (it's written on front of the package), although on amazon it is listed as a separate product.<br /><br />My dog is on a novel protein source diet and cannot eat the beef or chicken Pill Pockets, although he must take daily medications.  Getting him to take his daily medications was a huge hassle until I found out about these.<br /><br />I do agree with a previous reviewer about the smell and color of these duck/pea Pill Pockets.  The smell is unfortunate, to say the least, and the color is interesting-looking.  If my dog did not have allergic issues, I would definitely give him the regular beef or chicken flavor Pill Pockets instead.<br /><br />However, comparing the two products, I believe one reason the Allergy Formula Pill Pockets have a certain odd color is due to lack of added color. In other words, they have a more natural color. In the beef Pill Pockets, "caramel color" is one of the ingredients, but it is not in the Allergy Formula.  In case, anyone is interested, these are the ingredients in the Roasted Duck and Pea Allergy Formula: duck, glycerin, dried peas, natural flavors, vegetable oil, water, salt, potassium sorbate (to preserve freshness), xanthan gum, citric acid, preserved with mixed tocopherals (a source of Vitamin E).<br /><br />My dog likes the Allergy Formula Pill Pockets just as well as the regular Pill Pockets, so the offensive smell does not seem to affect him at all.<br /><br />Finally, I saw in an earlier review where someone said these were smaller than the normal "capsule" size.  I have NOT found this to be true. I have ordered several times and every time, the capsule size is the same as for the regular beef or chicken flavor Pill Pockets.  This means that usually you can break one in two, so they go twice as far.  The texture of these Pill Pockets is just as malleable as the normal ones and it's quite easy to hide a pill in them.  All in all, I highly recommend if your dog has allergy issues and can't take the normal ones.

review/summary: good for capsules, too - success depends on flavor
review/text: I got these because my local store was out of the capsule size in beef flavor.  I discovered that they work just as well for big capsules, if you use your fingers to press the treat around them.  My dog is very picky and yet he gets the capsule wrapped in this pocket without a problem.  This suits me fine, since the tablet pockets are cheaper.<br /><br />I took one star off because the ingredients are questionable, lots of chemicals, color, corn syrup and other crap.  If my dog were not that old that his comfort is more important to me than his health, I honestly wouldn't go near them.<br /><br />Also, he will not touch the duck flavor, though, but I reviewed this flavor separately.

review/summary: Great as training treats!
review/text: I took my golden retriever puppy to obedience school and these were the treats that they recommended for all the dogs for training! I break each treat into about four pieces so that after she does something right she gets a quick reward. My dog doesn't go wild for food/treats but she will do absolutely ANYTHING for one of these. Whenever she is running around outside and I can't get her to come back in all I have to do is hold up this bag and shake it and she will come running full speed from half a mile away.<br /><br />A MUST BUY FOR TRAINING PUPPIES OR DOGS!
