review/summary: So convenient
review/text: Couldn't find these in any grocery store, but wanted them for a very long plane trip so that I didn't have to worry about mixing bottles on a cramped airplane. It was a life saver. It did seem much thicker & darker in color than the powder formula, but my baby didn't seem to mind :) I was able to get it when we were in the states, but now that we are in Japan and planning a trip back to the states, I find that this item cannot be shipped to me & I am very disappointed.

review/text: I was buying this rawhide at Whole Foods for my dog. She loves rawhide but I refuse to give her the chemically manufactured toxin filled regular rawhide you can buy almost anywhere. These are WAY better priced however, and with my Prime account they arrive at my door within 2 days. Highly recommended; my dog loves to chew on these.

review/summary: Great product, but beware.
review/text: I definitely agree with all the good things that the other reviewer say about this product. I've used MRPs (mostly Met-Rx) for decades and also attest to their benefits. However, I gave it only three stars because I strongly object to the ad's omission of the fact that Labrada Nutrition's Lean Body contains sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose replaced aspartane---which from its invention at Searle was known to damage brain cells---as the no-calorie sweetner of over whelming choice by food packagers.<br /><br />Regrettably, sucralose is known to kill off our probiotics, the bacteria that enable food's digestion!<br /><br />We all have the right to take our chances. Nevertheless, the vendors of products that they encourage us to eat have the duty to inform of what those chances are.

review/summary: No Maltodextrin!!!
review/text: This product is the best meal replacement drink I have seen to date.  I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't.<br /><br />The main difference between this meal replacement and other meal replacement products I've seen is in the carbohydrates they provide.  Most other meal replacements I've seen either use sugars or maltodextrin as their main carbohydrate.  The problem with this is that they have a high glycemic index.  This means that when you eat them, your blood sugar rapidly rises and your body responds by making a lot of insulin.  Then in a very short time, your blood sugar is low and you have no energy and are hungry again.  This product is low sugar and no maltodextrin which is great.  Hopefully it has a low glycemic index.<br /><br />The oil blend is this product looks to be good.  They don't report the exact percentages of omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids but they do contain omega fatty acids.<br /><br />As for the protein, it's a blended protein that's 40 grams per serving.<br /><br />In my opinion, the taste of these products is great, but that's only an opinion.  Concerning the nutritional value of this product, everything I've said here is easy to validate with a little research.<br /><br />The only downfall of this product is the cost.  It's a lot cheaper to just blend protein powder, oatmeal and Udo's oil in a blender, but that obviously isn't nearly as convienent.  All in all, this is a great product, but be sure to shop around because the price can vary greatly.

review/summary: shake diet
review/text: Okay, I bought this product to do a shake diet. Instead of two scopes, I use one unless I was going to exercise, then I use two scoops. This is real good. I use water for my shakes so it won't be more calories. If you ever decide to do a shake diet, just know you're going to piss it off if you use water, milk have you on the toilet so it's best to do the water. I love this product! I've bought it two times and I've dropped off 20 pounds just doing a shake diet.<br /><br />Do one scoop [do two scoops thirty minutes to an hour before going exercising]<br />Do this every hour [you can have two solid meals but don't go over 250 calories, and no drinking shakes or eating after 8]<br />Use water instead of milk<br /><br />That's how I did it and I lost a lot. I would have gave it five stars but the price went up. When I first bought this product, I paid twenty-five dollars and some cents. Now it's almost thirty dollars. They need to go back down on the product. But if you're not doing a shake diet and just use this for workouts and stuff, I don't know how it's going to work you. Well I do know when you workout, you going to feel it like with any other workout but the next day, you will not be sore. That's why I love it. When I'm exercising, I feel the burn, the pain. I even feel it once I'm done but later that day or the next day, the pain is gone! If you buy this product, you'll love it! Great taste too if you know what you're doing.

review/text: This protein powder was highly recommended from a few of my friends when I started looking for something to help with my work out results.  This protein powder taste fantastic, especially when mixed with some frozen fruit and peanut butter, just like an ice cream shake.  It fills me up, it can be used as a meal replacement.  It also has helped me increased muscle size much faster then previously.  This product is great and I recommend it for anyone from an everyday Joe just trying to get into shape to people who are very serious about working out.

review/summary: Very nice flavor
review/text: I tired this product for the first time & have tried several others over the yrs. I found this one to be very nice in both flavor & texture. It blends well & doesn't have the chalky taste many others have. I tried it w/ just water & it was okay & tried it w/ lowfat greek yogart & also w/ some fresh fruit blended in to make it more as a smoothie. I work 12 hrs shifts & sometimes having this as a meal replacement works well rather than a lot of snacks with  meal while working or for the grab & go breakfast @ 4am (mixed the night before & chilled overnight & put in water bottle). I tied the strawberry flavor & will try others as i go along. ***HINT drink very chilled for best results.

review/summary: I use it as chocolate dessert replacement.
review/text: If one loves chocolate, this works great in a very low carb diet instead of sugar laden cake one can buy. I use 1 1/2 of the enclosed measuring spoon full of it and add very little water to it. Have it with my afternoon coffee like a small bowl of chocolate. My cravings for sweets have vanished. (1) Have taken the glamor out of chocolate. (2) Have made it practical. (3) In spite of being near the fridge all day working from home, I restrained myself to looking forward to this one dessert once a day. Now I'm used to it and feeling in charge.

review/text: I have just started using this supplement after workouts and it has taken me a bit to figure out a taste combo that I can live with. The milk-shake flavor may be a little bit overboard. I would probably like just a normal chocolate flavor. The recommendation is two scoops but I use one and I still feel the taste is quite strong. I mix one scope of this with 2 cups of almond breeze almond milk and sometimes some frozen strawberries - blend it in my blender and it is a great drink. It also provides enough chocolately flavor to cure any possible sweet tooth I might have.

review/text: I started this 2 weeks ago.  I have the strawberry flavor and I take it with almond milk since I have a dairy milk allergy.  It is very tasty at best!! Also, I have been having regular bowel movements since replacing my breakfast and sometimes dinner with Lean Body Protein Shake. I think I'm about to lose some weight too!!!

review/summary: Best so far!
review/text: Tried this product after doing a little research online (including here).  The product lived up to its good reviews.  Like most protein shakes, this is best cold.  I usually make a drink after exercising but with classes starting back up, I plan on switching to mornings since I'll be preoccupied during class.  The only downside to the product for me was trying to find the perfect amount of 10oz. of water to get the shake to taste perfect (I think I managed that feat twice), but nonetheless, it's still good.

review/summary: Disgusting
review/text: Look, I know there are nasty tasting whole earth raw shakes out there that are seriously nasty, and as an industry we've come a long way in flavor with these, but this vanilla ice cream powder is so nasty that I cannot describe it other than to say that it smells like a cheap "buttercream cupcake" candle, and it tastes like a whole truckload of quarters and fake Splenda sweetener rusting in your mouth...the way your mouth is cold when you haven't slept all night, like all that nasty at the same time.<br /><br />Now with all that said, the chocolate ice cream flavor is the best ever!! I make it as an after gym hot chocolate breakfast and it's just delicious and it works like even I can't believe. Get the chocolate and give it a little more water than it calls for, it's great.<br /><br />Gonna try the strawberry one next, hopefully it's like the chocolate one.

review/summary: don't like taste at all
review/text: I've have never had a good tasting protein meal replacement shake and this one is no better.  I know taste preference is all subjective.  But if you don't like the sickening sweet flavor of artificial sweetners and that nasty after taste, then you won't like this. Please note I hate the taste of diet soda too, just to give you a reference point.  After forcing myself to drink it once a day for a week, I just couldn't do it anymore. The articial sweetening is too much for me and the thought of having to drink it everyday..well I just can't do it.  I will continue making my own meal replacement shakes with plain whey protein with no artificial sweeters.  I like to mix in a little fruit( blueberries, raspberries or strawberries) or yogurt or honey to keep carbs low.

Now I can still enjoy this chocolate treat without fear of giving them up.  Riesen is perfect for any occasion, and I use them as cough drops.  Just pop one in your mouth and let it dissolve for great, smooth dark chocolate.

Also left an odd residue on my hand and stuck to the plate with a slick film.  The ingredients have corn syrup in them, something I had never seen in Marzipan.  While this is not the worst Marzipan I have seen (that one was hard "Plaza" brand with 3 types sugars, same as this one but swapping the corn syrup with the some other type of sugar), it is close second.  Just Yuk.

In my case, the nearest Filipino or Asian store is about 43 miles away since I live in the boondocks.  But for people like me who buy them on this page, you've proven your shopping savvy.  On a number of occasions, I've seen the same product on 2 different Amazon pages.  This 30oz Sky Flakes page is the "cheap" Amazon page.  The product is $9 and the shipping is $5.49 - for a total of $14.49.  But there's another mislabeled Amazon page that offers them with free shipping - but for $15.78:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009FHDB0">Skyflakes Crackers 28z</a><br /><br />On the product itself, Sky Flakes crackers are the best-tasting crackers I've ever eaten.  They do cost a bit more than domestic crackers.  But as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for.  Just be sure you pay for it on THIS page and not the other one (grin).

review/summary: Yummy - taste like sardines
review/text: Jack Mackerels are like big herrings, better known as sardines. They are headless and tailless, and they measure about the length of the can (perhaps by design).<br /><br />I saw a review in the listing for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GQ0W2Q">Chicken of the Sea, Mackerel, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> that said something like they were God-awful or whatever. That's obviously a subjective POV, but I personally couldn't disagree more. THEY'RE SARDINES. Someone was bound and determined to get people not to eat these fish for whatever agenda. Personally I don't distinguish them taste-wise FROM sardines or herrings; they're just about twice or 3x the size. If you like sardines, you'll like jack mackerel.<br /><br />How to fix them? I like to open the can and dump them into a colander to drain away the salt brine they are preserved in. I do that with any canned good. Once out of the can, I like to bone them and put them in containers such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009P67Y4">GladWare Deep Dish Containers with Lids, 8 Cups (64 oz) 3 containers</a> and put them in the fridge; I can make one can last a long while that way. The bones are edible, like those of other sardines; I just prefer not to eat them. If you need the calcium, though, that's a great natural source. Anyway, whenever I'm ready to use them, I can eat them as is, maybe warm one or two up in a pan. They're not at all salty. Sometimes I make a mackerel fried rice that's delicious too, with mushrooms, green peas, rice, then add one or two filets of mackerel. People have even made salmon croquettes except of course substituting with mackerel meat.<br /><br />Pick them up in your bare hand, and you see they have some heft to them. In fact, feeling how heavy they are in my hand makes me a little sad that they were once living creatures, but like all of us they were put on earth to serve a purpose. They come individually in a 15 oz or 425g can. Serving size is 1/3 cup - which is a dumb measurement. I'll say one mackerel is a serving. It says there are about 5 servings per can, and there are 5 fish in the can, so do the math. One serving is 80 calories, has 280 mg sodium, 12g protein, 40 mg cholesterol, & 3g total fat. A serving also has 25% daily requirement for calcium. So that's not bad really for one small fish!<br /><br />I know it's probably easier to find Chicken of the Sea brand products in the store than the other brands, at least in my part of the world, so if you've ever been curious about this inexpensive canned fish that's usually found with the sardines and canned salmon, go ahead and give it a try. People are feeding their pets with this, but trust me, it's perfectly fine for human consumption. Enjoy them, and I hope I've helped you make a decision that works for you.

review/summary: Try it with baked salmon
review/text: The lime & chili flavor is a natural for salmon; salmon is often served with a slice of lemon to offset the oily fish, and although not typically served with salmon, the chili is a particularly complementary spice. Who knew? It is a great way to get kids to eat the salmon that is being served to the rest of the family. (I have not tried it on other fish yet.)

review/text: We have never been to the restaurant, but we bought a small canister of this Stubb's Chili Lime Spice at a gourmet foods market.  We like chili/lime and wanted to put some kick into our salsa. Oh my. It's the best stuff out there, and I can say that with authority. Read on.<br /><br />During all of our futile trips down the spice aisle of every place in town, we picked up chili/lime spice mixes by other brands. Nothing compares, and believe me, I've tried them all by now.<br /><br />It's been pretty sad around here lately. We have tried to ration the Stubb's, and we watch each other veeeeery closely when it's being used. If someone accidentally shakes some on the counter instead of the plate, there is an uncomfortable silence for a few minutes while we ponder how many bites we have missed out on having properly spiced.<br /><br />So I'm so relieved to be able to buy this whole CASE of Stubb's for my boyfriend for Christmas. It's not the most expensive gift he will be getting, but it will definitely be his favorite. And mine too!

review/text: Stubb's Chili Lime Rub is a truly amazing spice, one which can lift almost anything it touches.<br /><br />From simple popcorn to the finest fillet mignon, this stuff really has the magical ability to enhance without overwhelming - and ain't that the whole idea of spice in the first place. Beyond it's own tangy sweet/spicyness, it seems to pull out the natural flavor of foods. I've even put in on sliced apples with great results.<br /><br />Last Christmas I made up spice and sauce baskets as gifts. I had a lot of interesting and quality products in the baskets, but this was the one that friends all raved about. It is really THAT good and unique.<br /><br />Anyone who likes to cook, and likes life on the spicy side, needs to discover this. Seriously.<br /><br />Sam

review/summary: For sugar-free, this is great!!
review/text: I'm trying to watch my sugar intake and I love flavored coffees however, I hate that most flavored coffees seem to produce a weaker brew of coffee.  This syrup adds the right flavor and perfect sweetness.  I don't even use creamer!!  I only bought one bottle of this but I plan to buy more and I want to try some of DaVinci Gourmet's other flavors.  I wish Amazon carried all the sugar-free flavors but I'm probably going to have to go to their website if I want to try others.  I have not tried Torani's caramel sugar free syrup and I'd like to - however, I hate to waste my money on an inferior product when this one tastes so great!!  =)  If you like caramel flavoring and are looking for a Splenda sweetened sugar-free syrup, then I highly recommend you try this!!  =)

review/summary: I love couscous
review/text: I bought a bunch of these on a deal @ Amazon warehouse (which gave me $0.11 an ounce). I was really impressed with the quality of the couscous, it cooks very fine, and my husband is from North Africa where they eat this all the time, so he really felt like he was eating "home cooked food". If you really wanna cook couscous good, don't follow the directions on the box, cook it the way the Mediterranean people cook it, by steaming it. You can look it up online, but basically you add only a little bit of water and then you cover it and put it in the oven to steam. Anyway, this is a great brand, great deal, cooks real nice, and the great thing about it is it's a really filling and healthy food (better alternative to rice or pasta).

review/summary: Spectacular aged Gouda
review/text: I've ordered literally hundreds, probably into the thousands, of items from Amazon and this is the first review I've ever left.<br /><br />As to the logistics of the whole process: The cheese was incredibly well-packaged, and I had a question that I shot them right after ordering (the 1 lb.) and it was answered a couple hours after I sent it to them. The customer service was fantastic.<br /><br />The actual quality of the cheese was unbelievable. Absolutely superb. If I could give this more than a 5 star rating I would...  The taste is unreal. The Reypenaer itself arrived vacuum sealed, in a package with cold gel packs, and the external packaging was so secure a 300lb. postal worker could've sat on it and it wouldn't have been damaged.<br /><br />It's rich and has a definite smoothness (even before you eat it you can almost tell it will - it has fine crystallizations as it should with this grade of aged genuine Dutch Gouda.) Creamy with several layers of taste... from caramel to a buttery fruit taste that's impossible to describe without actually having it. Thin slices over a decent dark bread while drinking a glass of good IPA (or 10) - insanely great. If you're into gourmet cheese, this is a 100% safe bet. The same bread with the same beer with a thin slice of this Reypenaer but also lightly dipped or drizzled with a killer EVOO (like Bariani,) awesome. Sipping an awesome Scotch (like Macallan) splashed with equal parts luke water and slices of this over good bread, equally as insanely great.<br /><br />This is the first item I've ever ordered that exceeded my expectations to this degree, so I'm tossing my review in here. Believe me; you can't go wrong ordering it.

This is essentially the same product as the condensed, but it's not condensed.<br />But if you're looking for a heartier product with more noodles and vegetables try the Campbell's Chunky series. The Chunky series will have more calories though.<br />This is a much easier price on the wallet then buying at the local super market.

Maggy knows to go over on one of the carpet runners and doesn`t just start chewing one in the middle of the carpet. For my previous Boxer several years ago, I would get her rawhide bone things and pig ears. She would chew for hours until it got real soft and swallow, or try to swallow that big chunk of soft pig skin, and chocked more than once til she got it out and tried again. I stopped giving her those, but hadn`t ever tried these chew sticks. I have various treats for good deeds she does, and give her one of these chew sticks every few days, sometimes one in a week. Maggy is happy with them, so I am too.

None of the chocolate notes noted at lower brew volumes remain.<br /><br />Overall, not much to recommend. These would translate well into a 12 GM pod for the "light" coffee drinker.
