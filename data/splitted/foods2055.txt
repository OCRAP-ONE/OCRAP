review/summary: Great All-Purpose Cat Treats
review/text: Our cat loves all the Party Mix flavors, but I ordered this bulk package since it was the best price at the time, plus it helped me get to the purchase threshold for the free super saver shipping!  We generally use these treats a few at a time to get her to bed at night (she sleeps in an extra bathroom with her litter box) or out from under couches, beds, etc.  I've used many of the Friskies products over the years and have liked them all.

review/summary: Scrumptious...a real cat pleaser
review/text: My two cats say "these are the best treats ever!"<br /><br />Our cat Wiggles is one who hasn't found need to grow up and although her poor pregnant stomach is near bursting stage she lets out a loud squeaky meow and comes running pel mel across the floor when she hears the treat bag open!  Our older cat, Cowboy, thinks he is quite refined and is very proper, even HE gets excited about these treats.<br /><br />Judging from the cat's behaviors these must be great treats!  Other treats just don't bring on as much enthusiasm, and to think I bought these on a whim and just grabbed any old bag.<br /><br />I'll be sure to buy the Wild West flavor from here on out!

review/summary: Beachside Party Mix
review/text: I've given my cats a few different kinds of treats daily & these are by far their favorites.... They love them more than any of the others and come running as soon as they here me get the package out. Really helps clean their teeth so it helps get rid of that bad kitty breath from eating other soft chewy treats. I won't buy the soft treats anymore as thier breath is so bad from it & they love these the best & so do I. They cost $1.50 a pack in the Walmart store so they are even cheaper here to buy & no sales tax, at least not in Iowa on these. I haven't tried the other flavors because these give them a variety so why bother with just one flavor.

review/summary: Party mix is now one of my cat's favorite treats
review/text: The various Friskies "party mix" flavors of treats really appeal to my cat's taste buds. They are his new favorites. Especially the Beachside Crunch version. He used to be a treat fanatic, but lately he hasn't been eating as many treats because he's been filling up more on wet food; that's sort of replaced his "dry treat" routine. However, he usually will still eat the party mix if I give it to him, even if he shuns other treats.<br /><br />And one other great thing about party mix - the price is cheap, but you get a lot for your money, since it is a good-sized bag. Great taste, great value - what's not to like?

The flavor is delicious - sweet and slightly tangy.  The only problem we have is that we go through an entire can in a matter of minutes!  I like that they are totally natural - no added sugars or preservatives and the kids love them.  Honeyville strawberries are awesome as well.

review/summary: Great in the larger diced cubes
review/text: I've ordered several cases of freeze-dried fruits from Honeyville and their products are awesome (my toddler loves their peaches, strawberries and peas).  My only reservation is uniformity of the product: I've had orders of the peaches where each little piece is about a 1/2 inch cube, and others where they are very tiny--like shriveled knobby flakes.  I definitely prefer the former for snacking (the company was excellent about taking back and refunding the "shriveled" order"). Overall, this is a healthy, natural snack that's perfect for kids, but beware of eating straight from the can--you'll be surprised at how quickly it disappears!

review/summary: Could anything else have made 1:45 in the morning as amazing?
review/text: I was coming back to Queens from a show in the city and I suddenly felt a hankerin' for something that would lead to cancer. I pulled into my friendly dimly lit market, strolled up and down the aisles looking for Bloody Mary mix, when suddenly the words "All Butter Loaf" jumped out at me like the Virgin Mary on toast. "All Butter Loaf?!" I exclaimed out loud. To not take that home would be criminal. So, after doubling back down the aisle and grabbing the salt-and-vinegar chips, which had also grabbed my attention, I boldly strolled up to the cashier, pulled out my charge card -- cha-ching! -- and they were mine. I opened up the bag of chips before barely getting my other foot out of the store, but I knew that the All Butter Loaf must be respected, and you gotta slide a plate under a puppy like that. So when I got home, and I took my first slice of All Butter Loaf and jammed the whole thing into my mouth, I knew that this was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Two a.m., All Butter Loaf and my hung-over arse on an ugly Ikea sofa. My life was never the same.

review/summary: Tasty, Sweet and Natural Treat.
review/text: Unlike what another reviewer said, brown rice syrup IS sugar, just an alternative to other types of sweeteners typically used in other products. Hey, I'm all on board for a natural sweetener versus the crap they put in most bars, but this isn't health food. Just because it doesn't explicitly state "sugar" on the ingredients list doesn't mean it isn't there and I think saying this stuff has no sugar can be mighty misleading and trust me, there's plenty of sweetness to this bar. I doubt much of it is naturally occurring--I eat unsweetened coconut in many forms on a regular basis and most people I've fed it to don't particularly like it without extra sweetener unless we're eating a real deal fully mature brown coconut. My first thought when I bit into the bar was that the sugar level was similar to the sweetened flaked coconut used for baking, if not sweeter. In any case, it's still a treat to be used in moderation, though it is quite tasty. I certainly wouldn't eat it everyday (or every week for that matter), but they're a nice backup snack to keep in my car if I have to run somewhere without eating and need something with enough calories and fat to keep me going another couple hours. I usually snack on fruit and eat a whole foods based vegan diet, so I personally thought these bars were overly sweet (my artificial sweet tolerance is much lower than the average Joe). But I'm fully aware that most people eat a lot more sugar than I do on a regular basis, and their artificial sweetener tolerance is probably much higher than mine is so this might be just perfect for the average shopper. Also, the pineapple is far more of a background flavor to the coconut, but I still liked it quite a bit. Overall, this is something I definitely stock up on when they go on sale in my local natural foods market.

review/text: My boyfriend and I love these bars. They have just 3 simple ingredients: coconut, rice syrup, and pineapple. These bars are sweet, chewy, moist and YUMMY! I forgot they don't have sugar. I was eating one, thinking, "Oh well, it is OK to have sugar sometimes... ", and then I looked at the ingredients, and was reminded that they don't contain sugar, just rice syrup as the sweetener. Since coconut is naturally slightly sweet, these don't even need much sweetener, just a little. Try these, for a healthy, natural treat! Especially refreshing in the summer, since coconut is cooling. Great for children, too, I would think.

review/text: I use these as energy bars when I am in school/at work. They are certainly not diet bars, but because they have the natural coconut oil in them, they fill me up and keep me going.  The flavor is very subtle, and the pineapple is nearly non-existant, so be aware of that.  They have a gentle coconut taste, and they are the texture of shredded coconut, similar to the inside of a mounds bar but FAR less sweet.  I find them to be a perfect balance between a treat and a splurge.

review/text: I happened upon this mixer because of the color on the shelf and purchased it because I love green apple flavor and enjoy having Appletinis when out with my friends for a girl's night out.<br /><br />Unfortunately I can't enjoy adult versions of such beverages anymore but I now add this green apple infusion to lemon lime soda for a sparkling spritzer and I also add it to sparkling apple cider.<br /><br />Yes, it can be a bit sweet but does add a tart/sour note to help that, and it's just so pretty in the glass it looks festive, just like an adult beverage when in a pretty glass.<br /><br />The other thing that I love about this product is the bottle.  When the delicious contents are no more, I remove the labels, wash the bottles and then decorate them as gifts for friends as olive oil and vinegar containers with the fancy pour tops.<br /><br />They can also be used to make designer decor, like filling them with dried legumes and grains of different colors, and then dip the corked top in melted wax and do a little raffia around the neck with a gift tag or dried flowers and, voila!  You have a hostess gift.<br /><br />I'm all about repurposing items whenever I can and these bottles are beautiful filled with their sour apple infusion as well as anything else!

review/summary: Great Product but Hefty Hefty Hefty Price
review/text: The packaging of this product (small cans) is perfect for cats who won't eat the entire standard can and will starve before eating from an open can several hours later.  The cats like the flavor and frankly it smells like human food.<br /><br />HOWEVER= while it shipped with a coupon for price savings on it I have to go to Target or equivalent to use the coupon, and AMAZON's prices are creeping up to a point where it is hard to find "bargains" as was once the case for bulk purchases.  I have stopped buying this as my two cats can breeze through the 24 cans in about two weeks (it supplements their dry food) and a $21 bi weekly snack for the cats is too expensive for these economic times.

review/summary: Magic Cat Food Brought My Old Cat Back To Life
review/text: I am very happy with this particular Fancy Feast. My 16 year old tabby was tired and failing. The vet said that she was just old. She didn't seem to like any of her food so I tried experimenting and found this White Meat Chicken Tuscany with Savory Sauce and Greens.<br />WOW, what a difference in 6 months. She is running around the house and going outside a lot more. She is no longer scared of other cats and seems to love sitting in the sun and watching the other cats play in the yard. This food combination has had a revolutionary effect and improved my old cat's life.

This flavor seems to be one their favorites especially my Chrissy Snow, she likes the wetter foods that appear to have more vegetables.

I bought two different energy shots years ago that did that and it made me nervous taking them.  I had my fingers crossed and gave this one a try at Duane reade one day.  It works like a charm without the downsides and crashing.  So I immediately bought a box here at amazon for a better deal! Another plus --it doesn't taste bad at all! None of that cough tasting medicinal taste. Will stick to this one.

I got so spoiled having a great cup of a coffee in less than no time that we began using these filter packs at home as well. They are way over priced when compared to the grocery store price but they sell out very fast so you can't always get them.

review/summary: Perfect for cold-brew coffee
review/text: During the summer, I like to keep a pitcher of cold-brew coffee in the fridge for iced coffee (cold-brew coffee is less bitter than chilled hot-brew coffee).  These coffee packs are the easiest, no-fuss way I've found to make that happen.  Throw 2-3 packs (depending on taste) in two quarts of cold water, let it sit for 10-12 hours at room temperature, then remove the packs and refrigerate the delicious brew.  Serve over ice, with or without milk (or, for the particularly decadent, some half-and-half, or better still, a splash of cream).

I used to suffer through sprinkling grounds all over the counter -- getting more on the sink than in the basket, and then I'd have to tolerate grinds in the bottom of the pot, but no more with these packs!  What a nice idea.  Sure, they a pricier than big cans, plus they are no joy for "coffee snobs," but they are perfect for us others...

review/summary: Inexpensive, convenient, organic, tasty. 5 stars isn't enough!
review/text: Had tried another flavrz product and was impressed so decided to give this one a try as well. This is my favorite taste wise - a very balanced fruit punch taste. Definitely does give me an energy boost so don't try this right before bedtime! :) Low sugar, low calorie. No artificial colors, flavors or sweeteners. Its organic so no pesticide residue and no genetically modified ingredients. The small foil packet is easy to transport and can be mixed to your taste preference: 8oz water for a sweet drink, 12-16oz water for medium sweetness, 20oz water for a flavored water drink. Cheaper than buying a bottled drink of this sort - especially with the subscribe and save option from Amazon. Absolutely love that this takes a disposable plastic drink bottle out of the equation! If you pack your children's lunches for school, this would make an awesome addition because they can just add it to their reusable water bottle. The packet is easy to open and easy to mix - just pull the perforated tab at the top off and pour into a glass of water or your own water bottle. Makes a great smoothie base. This also helped solve my problem of how to take psyllium husk and make it taste decent: mix a packet with 12 oz water, pour off 8 oz into a cup (save the other 4 oz to drink later), add 1 rounded tsp psyllium husk, let sit to thicken. You end up with what I would describe as a healthy jello that tastes more like a treat than a fiber drink. Can't think of any cons about the product, but pretty sure yerba mate has some caffeine content so would like to see caffeine content added to the nutrition label.

review/text: I've contacted stores in California, Colorado, and Texas, hoping family members could mail me Maxwell House Coffee Singles, but none could find them. They must only be sold in stores east of the Mississippi River.<br /><br />I've purchased this 4-box pack via Amazon several times, and the cost is less per single than if I bought Folgers Singles at a local store. This really is the way to go when only one person wants to drink coffee. You don't waste coffee grounds. Just boil 8 oz of water for one single or 16 oz for two; pour, wait 60 seconds, dip for 15 seconds, and you're done! If you like strong coffee, just let it sit longer.<br /><br />Maxwell House singles have a smooth, pleasant flavor that don't give me heartburn like other instant coffees.

review/summary: Best Seasoning Ever!!
review/text: For many years I have looked for a seasoning that would replace my old seasoning that went out of business almost 2 decades ago.  I have tried many different ones and none would compare.  Luckily a friend of mine lives in Missouri and sent me some.  I was really expecting it to be like all the others but low and behold,  I found my new favorite seasoning.<br /><br />I have been using it now for 3 years and still love it.  Each canister lasts about a year (with heavy use).  Its great for steaks and other beef but it's especially good for pork.  I have also tried their Steak Seasoning,  It's a bit different than the BBQ seasoning,  once a learned not to use it like a rub and more sparingly, it turned out to be perfect also.<br /><br />I highly suggest anyone trying this seasoning.<br /><br />My wife likes it also and she is not much of a meat lover.  She uses it for chicken and pork chops.

review/summary: My cat no longer needs insulin because of this food
review/text: I have a diabetic cat. My cat started exhibiting symptoms and I went to my vet who started him on insulin. He progessively got worse, as the insulin doses steadily increased. My super smart, very litter trained cat got completely out of his mind one night and climbed on top of a shoe box and peed. Poor thing didn't know where he was or what was going on.<br /><br />At that, I went to the internet and found yourdiabeticcat.com. I started reading and was so skeptical but out of pure desperation I started doing what the people on the boards there suggested. I started tracking my cat's blood sugar daily at home myself. I took him off of dry food and started feeding him fancy feast classics. His blood sugars eventually started leveling out.<br /><br />I went back to my vet and informed her of my changes with my cat and she was amazed. I asked her to research some concerns I had with the fancy feast. She researched it for me and told me the fancy feast is fine. My cat no longer gets insulin shots. I honestly couldn't believe it myself. He is back to his normal self: smart, energetic, and using his litter.<br /><br />I now buy this food automatically off of amazon in three different flavors for variety. I have two cats and they both love all three classic flavors that I buy. (Turkey, Chicken and Beef) I highly recommend this food for the health of your cat.<br /><br />Also, I have two large male cats and they eat an average of 3 cans a day each. Hopefully that will help you figure out how much you need for your cat. If for some reason, they get full and don't finish a full can in one sitting I have to cover up the left overs. They will not eat them if they have dried out, but they will eat them if I have covered them and allowed them to retain their moisture.

review/text: I rarely spend the time to review items on here, but this one is worth it. The price was about equal to what I would pay in the store (Fancy Feast has been running near 75 cents a can lately for some reason) and no sales tax or delivery charges (Amazon Prime). It is delivered to my door exactly as promised and my cat is happy - hence I am happy. End of story.

review/summary: Mmm, mmm, good!
review/text: Our fur babies love this product!  As an example as to how yummy it must be, not that I have tasted it, just compare having to eat a fried grasshopper versus ice cold creamy ice cream (OK, so you can choose your own favorite food).  Which one would you choose?  That is what the fur babies think about this food compared to other cat foods.  They go crazy over it.  They prefer the pate style over the sliced or chunkie.  Also, they love the gravy!  Too bad Fancy Feast doesn't sell a bottle of gravy too.<br /><br />We used to feed the "higher quality" foods and our cats would like them for a short time and then grow tired of them very quickly so we had to keep finding a new food they would like and on it went.  But we don't have that problem now with the Fancy Feast because they never seem to get tired of it.  When you look at the list of ingredients, at least the "meat by-products" is listed 5th down on the list and Beef, Beef Broth, Liver, Fish, is all before the by-products.<br /><br />We use the subscribe and save and have been so pleased with that service!  No more having to go to the store and pick up multiples of cans of cat food, put them all on the conveyer belt, bag them and lug them home.  With the subscribe and save, not only is there is no hassle, very fast shipping, we are saving money too since the price here is less expensive than at stores.  We would order two cases and receive free shipping.

review/summary: Used to be great....now makes cat puke!
review/text: My cat has eaten Fancy Feast for years (I'm a "subscribe & save" purchaser, which is great -- beats hauling it home from the store all the time!).  Same flavors (all "Classic") -- Tender Chicken Feast, Tender Beef Feast, and Tender Chicken & Beef Feast.  But within the past few months, I've gotten shipments of the Tender Beef Feast....popped open a can from the shipment, fed it to him...and about an hour later he was violently throwing up (multiple times).  To Amazon's credit, they did immediately credit my account and send a replacement...but just a fair warning that there could be a problem with the food (I've also reached out to Purina).  After this most recent shipment, I've cancelled my "Tender Beef Feast" shipment...and I'm planning on giving him chicken from now on.

You will have to try it with your own personal fur people.<br />It is a solid can of food and is not in little bites; it is pate style. It is very dark brown and does smell of beef. So if your cats like that type of food, they will probably like this. But if not, better pass on it.

Of course that makes them more expensive.  Xylitol is a "cool" sweetener which gives it a slightly minty taste.  Be careful with Xylitol around pets.  Its very harmful to dogs.

Furthermore, the gum tastes very plastic after a minute or two. Checking the ingredients nothing indicates the materials used for the gum ( the ingredients simply indicate "gum base" ). Overall, I did not feel confident about this product's quality

review/summary: Best in Class Dry Dog Food
review/text: Pet food has an immense range of quality that you can very roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars); (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product (3-4 stars); and (3) "price is no object" foods that make no compromises (5-6 stars).  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog food anywhere.  Period.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with the highest quality ingredients you'll ever find in dog food.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food there is.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product:  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for "hill's science diet dry dog food."  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.

I thought about what animals eat in the wild and decided that grains were not commonly eaten by canines. My daughter told me about this food and recommended that I try it. I researched this food on line and found it to be grain free. However, it was a little more expensive than I would like, so I searched for it at Amazon and found it for a lot less money. My dog was taken off of some medication that was suspected of causing her seizures and I started feeding her Orijen mixed with warm water, I wanted to increase her water intake, she was having difficulty lapping up water in the unusual way. She is much better now. I believe this natural food is better for her and she loves it!

When you open the bag it smells fresh and my dog, who is a very picky eater, wanted it right away.  As another poster recommended, slowly introduce this food to your pet.  I thought that I did, but she got bad diarhea, probably because she isn't accustomed to eating food made with the ingredients specific to dogs.  I had to back her off and we'll go back to it more slowly.  I will definitely buy again and recommend it to others.

review/summary: Beware of this food
review/text: About a year ago I decided to put my dog on a better food as she was (at the time) 11 yeas old and I want her to live the longest, healthiest life possible, much like everyone else, as she is not just a pet to me but also a daughter. I stopped at my local "mom & pop" pet food store and asked some questions. I knew little about the better brands as she's always been on grocery store brands. I was directed toward Orijen as it is one of the better brands out there, it's very high in protein, you can understand all of the ingredients and it's "so healthy, a human could eat it". Of course I bought it, and my dog loved it. Little did I know how damaging the food was to her, as quite honestly, she exhibited no symptoms. Back in January my dog had to be put in the ICU due to an accident. It was during that stay where the vet noticed how high her liver levels were. Her alkaline & phosphatase as well as her calcium levels in the kidneys were all very high as well. The vet put her on 3 different liver support medicines and we had to follow up every month with more blood work to reassess the situation. After the 3rd month, the vet was suspicious that cancer was present. When I hear that, I immediately did some research on the food. It was then that I noticed how high the protein content is and what that much protein could do to a body. I presented my research and concerns to the vet, who wasn't as convinced as I was. After the 4th blood draw, and still no changes, we made the mutual decision to wean her off of Orijen and on to Science Diet (although just about any other brand would have worked too). A month later after the switch, and my dog was presented with a clean bill of health. Her alkaline & phosphatase levels are still slightly elevated, but I'm told there is nothing to worry about now. We concluded it was the food that was damaging and slowly killing her, as she was deemed healthy at the start of feeding her the food, A few months prior to all of this, she went though a full work up in order to get her teeth cleaned.<br /><br />I write this not to slander Orijen, I only want to educate others on my own personal experience. While it happened to my dog, that doesn't mean it will effect all dogs the same. Just please keep in mind, my dog showed no symptoms while on the food that anything was wrong. If it weren't for her stay in the hospital, we never would have known how much damage this food was causing her. If your dog is presently on this food, maybe a precautionary blood draw at their next exam would be worth your while.

review/summary: Good mix if you don't have time or ingredients for homemade
review/text: We like this mix when time is shorter or I don't have everything I need for chicken curry made from scratch.  As noted before, it is a hot mix.  With Shan spice mixes though, you can use what you like, so if you're leery of the heat, I would suggest just using 1/4-1/2 a packet first. If you want it hotter next time, increase the amount.  I'm surprised at the price for this - we get these mixes locally for 99 cents a box.
