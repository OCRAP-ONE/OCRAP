review/text: These were easily the best-tasting protein bars I've had yet. The bars themselves are comfortingly hefty and substantial, there is no bad aftertaste (or any artificial taste), the consistency is brownie-like, and those who don't mind the amount of sugar in the product will be pleased.

review/summary: The best Salad dressing EVER
review/text: This is the BEST Salad Dressing I have ever had and it is Fat Free and Carb Free.  I found this in Florida while on Vacation but when I got home to Virginia I was unable to find.  I was determined to find it again and I did...go to this website [...] and you can buy directly.  I bought by the case and even with shipping charges it was still extremely reasonable.  I would have paid $10 per bottle...it is THAT GOOD!!

review/text: I had never purchased croutons before I found these at the grocery. Not only did they taste wonderful on salads, I have started putting them in soups and even using them as a quick munchie straight out of the bag! The Ranch flavor croutons are also excellent. When my grocery stopped carrying them, I tried other brands but none come close.

review/text: I've reviewed the peppermint truffle cremes before.  They're deliciously decadent.  I recently ordered this 24oz tub.  It didn't last a month.  What did you have for breakfast? truffle creme.  What did you have for lunch?  truffle creme.  What did you have for dinner? 2 truffle cremes. Can you say addictive?  My advice?  Have a family member who doesn't like mint, chocolate, or both, if such a person exists, hide the tub from you.  It's your only hope. ;D

review/summary: Closest thing to a Frango yet!
review/text: We found the 24oz bag at Costco last week.  This seems to only be around for the Holidays so stock up if you find them at your club.  That said they are about half the price at Costco as they are going for here at Amazon so if you have a membership head there fast.  As a long time Frango lover we are always looking for a Frango like chocolate since we only get to Seattle every other year or so to visit family.  Very happy to report that these truffle creme mints are the closest knockoffs yet.  Since Macy's bought out the Bon Marche years ago Frango's seem to have changed anyway (not as good as they used to be)  The secret ingredient that is slightly lacking in these mints is of course bad for you and that is salt.  These are just slightly less salty than the real deal but probably better for you as far as your blood pressure goes.  Of course if you want to make it taste like the real deal just grab your salt grinder and hit it with a light coating and pop in your mouth and you will have the perfect winning combination of chocolate, mint, sweet, salty in one glorious fell swoop.  WARNING:  As others have noted these things are ADDICTING!  But so well worth it.  Highly recommended!

Their pods should be the ones sold w/the machine as Senseo's coffee tastes like instant.  If you want the taste you expect w/your one cup machine, use Aloha Island Coffee.

review/text: Wow!  This coffee is so much better than the Senseo Dark Roast I've been using in my Senseo.  It's not even a fair comparison.  My only semi-gripe is that my Senseo machine doesn't seem to understand how much water to squirt out over the pod, which is meant to be used as a single in the double pod holder. I have ended up using the two cup button once, then using the same pod and cup, the one cup botton.  That gives me ALMOST a decent sized mug of coffee.

review/summary: A good, decent cup
review/text: The coffee that my Senseo coffee machine made never got beyond tasting plasticy and metallic, even though I rinsed the unit as directed when I first got it, and followed all procedures.  I had to give up on it and get a Cuisinart, which I love.  However, the flavor that emerged from these Kona pods, as far as I could tell (beyond the mask of the plastic), was rich and good.  Not smooth, because nothing tasted smooth with the Senseo, but as flavorful as I could get.  To use a clich&eacute;, I wouldn't throw out the baby with the bath water.  If your Senseo works and doesn't make coffee that tastes metallic or plasticy, you might really love this coffee.  I thought it had real potential, and I don't blame the coffeemakers for what the machine did to the product.

Having purchased 100% Kona beans from the islands I started there. Kona is good. Then I saw an add for Cool Beans. I sent for their sampler. Tried them all and knew I had found what I had been searching for. A large cup from a single pod holder - 10 full oz. of great coffee. Needed to press pod firmly into single pod holder and dent the middle - but the results are worth the slight effort.RE

I get to work and mix two packets of this in a Nalgene bottle and sip on it all morning. SO refreshing, delicious and gives you that boost of energy! Have been drinking this stuff at work and home for several years now. Peach Mango used to be my favorite flavor (could rarely find it in the stores), but since they've added citrus and grape, grape is my absolute favorite flavor now! The peach mango and citrus mixed is really good too. I like all of the flavors, actually, but grape is my fave. MUST give this stuff a try!

review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

review/text: I am a big fan of Knudsen's spritzers.  They have dropped the can size from 12 oz. down to 10.5 oz., but that's plenty for me.  I think this mango is one of their best flavors along with strawberry and peach (the lemon/lime is awful).  Their spritzers are mostly grape or apple juice, but this one has enough mango to produce a distinct mango flavor.  Even without added sugar, Knudsen's spritzers are very sweet and can bee better with ice, some seltzer and/or some alcy.

review/text: I bought this salt after reading Suzanne Somer's books. It turned out to be great because this salt does contain more minerals than "NA/CL", meaning you get a supply of important nutrients and does not have to ingest anti-caking ingredients in regular salt. But I do not know if Himalayan does supply iodine. The food tastes great, you can feel the difference. Great product!!

review/summary: Best Tasting Salt AND So Incredibly Good For You
review/text: This is the best tasting salt I've ever had.  I learned about this after starting a "raw" diet and I was obsessed about having everything raw.  I'm a condiment queen and it was really hard for me to give up a lot of my condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo).  I was never a salt user - I'm a self-described fresh pepper addict and connoisseur.  However, once I realized this salt was raw, all natural and got great reviews, I decided to try it.  This really does enhance almost every dish I eat.  In addition, there are a ton of articles online explaining why this 200 million year old natural nutrient is so very good for us.  Move over table salt with your history of ridicule and side effects; move in Himalayan salt.

review/summary: Excellent flavor
review/text: I do a lot of Cajun cooking. I have been making my own seasoning combinations for a while.. I try to keep MSG and sugar out of my diet. I decided to give this a try. I made a pot of chilly. The only change I made this time was this salt. It was AMAZING!! My only regret now is that I only ordered a pound. Next time it will be more.<br /><br />This salt is also a great for exfoliation in the bath!<br /><br />One note: do be sure to add several grains of uncooked rice to the package as soon as you open it. It does start to clump rather quickly.

review/summary: Product not as described
review/text: Package arrived in time.  I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery.  The salt was more like rock salt - the crystals being slightly larger than what you find in kosher salt.  I have to dilute it with water before I can consume it.  If you sprinkle it on a salad or similar semi dry food, you will feel the crystals, which is an unpleasant experience because it feels like you have sand in your food.  This salt is not like regular salt that dissolves easily with little moisture/liquid. The package it is in is also labeled "finely ground".<br /><br />I use it for cooking - where I have no problems with it.  The three stars are only because the salt was not what I would consider finely ground.

review/summary: Delicious Nutritious Non-nuclear Salt at a Great Price
review/text: I love salt and use a variety of salts to keep my blood pressure up in the normal range.<br /><br />This salt, I think, may be the same as that sold by David Wolfe's LongevityWarehouse but you get twice as much for roughly the same price.  Not only are the descriptions similar, but comparing the salts side-by-side, they have the exact same color, flavor, texture, grind, fragrance, etc in my opinion.<br /><br />Himalayan salt is definitely much cleaner than sea salt ever since the Fukushima plant began leaking radiation into the Pacific Ocean last year if not before.  Many people are unaware of this because the major television stations are not broadcasting information that would incriminate their owners but just google or YouTube search if you want to know what is happening and what your government is not doing about it.  I definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like ENENews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth.  If the sea salt wasn't harvested before Fukushima started dumping nuclear waste, it is just too risky to ingest.<br /><br />This salt is from the Himalayas which may be just as far from Fukushima's dumping ground as you can get!

review/text: We rate this right up with high"er" quality sea salts. It has a strong flavor, but tastes clean. Far better than any typical table salt for sure. I'd rather buy this than kosher salt (we don't use regular iodized salt) for anything you add salt to at the table. For cooking, though, standard kosher salt is preferred by us.

review/summary: SALTY  SALT I HAVE EVER TASTED
review/text: This salt is pink in colour and upon recieveing it I used a tooth pick and dampened the end of the tooth pick and stuck the tip, JUST THE TIP, of the tooth pick into the pink looking salt and tasted it, and WOW! The salt taste about knocked me off my feet! The 2 pounds of this salt will last a very long time! I can use a lot less to salt whatever I want to have a salted flavour. It takes very little sprinkled on food or when cooking to obtain the desired salt flavour. It is great salt and it will last much longer than normal every day salt from the grocery store down town that I usualy buy for 78 cents to a dollar something. I recomend all people give this salt a try. As far as Iodine as a nessary nutriant, just eat potatoes ever so often and you will get the nessary iodine that you need in your diet, so no worries there. I can not wait to try this Himalayan Salt on Popcorn. I have been very un-satisfied with the normal every day salt from the store for a long time. Even sea salt has no "punch" to it like this salt. This is salt as it was meant to be and taste. (my opinion)

review/summary: good salt, good price, but not fine!
review/text: I got this to hold us over because our usual supplier was sold out right when we needed more Himalayan salt. The quality is good, but the salt is most certainly NOT finely ground. The crystals are the same size as previous Himalayan salt that we purchased in the past, which is coarser than regular table salt. When described as finely ground, I was expecting smaller sized crystals. Our usual supplier is in stock again, so I probably won't be purchasing this brand again if not necessary. But the price is pretty good and the quality seems fine, so I would recommend this to people who are looking to try Himalayan salt.

review/summary: Very pretty, but would not buy again
review/text: I bought this as an alternative to the sea salts that I normally purchase.  I find that the salt does not dissolve fully - it leaves a gritty residue behind, whether in sauces, soups, pickles or pasta water.  The flavor is fine, and when cooked in dishes the grit doesn't seem to be an issue, but I like my salts to be versatile, and this one doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I've got a Himalayan pink salt cooking plate, and I'm quite satisfied with that, but I don't use any liquid when cooking with it.

review/summary: This salt blows away "Real" salt!
review/text: I went to the Sunflower Market in Dallas and got a bag of Real salt from Utah. It is way better in flavor than chemical salt however the dirt and sand are off putting! You see, I add salt to all my drinking water and right away noticed real salt was leaving a sand-looking substance at the bottom of the bottle so I could only drink 80% of the water before re-filling. Real salt is the laziest company I know for not using an evaporation/filtering process to remove the dirt and sand!<br /><br />I am now the happy new owner of 4 lbs of Himalayan salt and it's not only clean unlike real salt, it tastes 10 levels better too! The company also has something like 200 different salts for your salt tasting pleasure! I will be ordering much more and sending as a gift to all my friends and family! This stuff is the "real" deal unlike Real LOL. Real salt should use as their motto "Hey, just tryin' to keep it real"<br />LOL ...losers

review/summary: Couldn't be more pleased!
review/text: One reviewer  described The spice Lab Finely Ground Himalayan Salt  grains as being too  being large.  Not mine.  Mine  is finer than course kosher salt.<br /> I ordered a small package first to check it out and now I am ready to spring for a big one.<br /> It seems to take less salt,  it's easy to control with your "pinches", and it tastes great!<br /><br /> I love the consistency of this Himalayan.  It is in no way as fine as table salt but somewhere in between table and Kosher - leaning more to the Kosher.  Maybe half as fine as course Kosher.<br />  Some salts I have bought have just been too fine for me to predict how much salt I'm really adding.  I'm not good with really finely ground salts and end up over salting or under salting.<br /> I like to see each individual grain of salt if you will...and I can with this  Himalayan.<br /><br />I couldn't be more pleased and the price is good too.  Came in great shape nicely packaged...

I found them at my local Walmart.<br /><br />If you like the taste of pumpkin, seek out these cookies because they do taste like pumpkin. I'm guessing the cheesecake part of the cookie is what I originally thought were white chocolate bits. Great combo. It's a shame they have to be a limited edition item because they should be available year round.<br /><br />Tastes really good.

review/text: These Cookies are beyond tasty- They are heavenly & decadent! They have a cakelike texture with the perfect amount of pumpkin spices, and a cheesecake flavored white chip that completes the experience!  And, It is such a GOOD thing they are only available during the Holiday season (and I pray they keep it that way)or I'm telling you- I would be as big as the broadside of a barn.  That is no joke. Just one small cookie (approx. 1 oz with a 3" diameter) contains a whopping 130 Calories, 4.5 grams of fat (2.5 saturated) and 21 grams of carbohydrates (12 of those sugar carbs).  So, just like everything else yummy in this world, this tasty tempation should be enjoyed in moderation. Thank you Pepperidge Farms for this tasty treat during the Holidays, and my waist, hips and behind would appreciate it if you keep it as a special Holiday only treat. :)

Quinoa is more of a sprout than a grain and very nutritious (look it up on Wikipedia).

I tried several and they were all delicious. We even like to eat it like oatmeal in the morning. I'm not much into "new wave" food, but this is a winner.

review/summary: Like Brown Rice? Try Quinoa!!
review/text: This stuff's great.  Comparing calories, it's roughly similar to brown rice.  However, the glycemic index is lower, and the amino acid profile is more complete.  Plus, there is a lot more protein in quinoa, compared to brown rice!  Just check it out on calorie-count.com, nutritiondata.com, whfoods.com, and wikipedia.<br /><br />Amazon has the BEST deal on quinoa around--12 boxes of this stuff for $25.  Sure, it's almost twice as expensive as brown rice, but it's worth it!<br /><br />Did I mention that quinoa cooks in less than 15 minutes??  Try that with brown rice (and without pressure cooking, cheaters)!<br /><br />Substitute quinoa for any rice dish.  I make spanish rice with quinoa (the 'rice' becomes a misnomer).  Same thing for black beans and rice.  This stuff's delicious and well textured!<br /><br />Anyway, spread the word about this thing--it really needs to be a bigger staple in the american diet, along with rice and pasta!!

review/summary: Excellent Quinoa, Way Over Priced.
review/text: I love Ancient Harvest Organic Quinoa.  It is well picked over for twigs, hulls and debris and has been very well rinsed.  It is ready to cook right out of the bag as it is so you can toast it in the pan before adding the cooking liquid.  That makes quinoa taste so much better.<br /><br />It is way too over priced though.  Even the way over priced Bob's Red Mill brand is quite a bit cheaper.  Quinoa of this quality should not cost more than $3.99/lb.  If you live near a Trader Joe's or a good bulk food store get your quinoa there.  Currently, here on Amazon, Arrowhead Mills comes in at about that price if you sign up for Subscribe & Save but I've heard that it is not as well rinsed which would be a problem quality wise.  Eden quinoa costs over $4/lb here but is still cheaper than Bob's Red Mill or Ancient Harvest.<br /><br />So quality wise I'd give this 5 stars but because of the poor price/value I give it 1 star, hence the 3 star review.

review/summary: Healthy food, a nice substitute for rice to add variety to any diet
review/text: I started using quinoa as part of healthier eating plan. In calories it is similar to brown rice but with a lower glycemic index. It contains all nine essential amino acids, making it a complete protein.<br /><br />I like eating it in different ways:<br />1)  A like quinoa as a side dish. It takes sauces very well.<br />2) I  like it cold to add bulk to the salad.  My favorite is to mix it with spinach with tangy dressing.<br />3) I like as a home-made cereal in the morning. I add frozen fresh berries which I defrost in the microwave just until they are slightly warm.<br />4) Quinoa has fiber to bulk up stool, and phosphorus to stimulate bowel movement. If you combine it with prunes as your morning cereal you get a real cleansing effect!<br />Here is my favorite recipe for this treat - tasty and effective.<br />1 cup of water<br />1/2 cup quinoa<br />1 pinch of nutmeg<br />1 tsp graded ginger<br />1/3 cup of chopped prunes<br />1/4 cup rice milk<br />Bring the water, quinoa, nutmeg and ginger to boil. Reduce heat and simmer covered for 10 minutes.  Then stir in the prunes and rice milk. Cover again and cook for 5 more minutes.<br /><br />Quinoa naturally grows with a bitter layer of saponins, to remove the bitter test Quinoa is pre-washed before packaging to remove the bitter shell. I was pleased with Ancient Harvest quality, I did not detect any bitterness in their quinoa.<br /><br />Amazon deal on the 12 box of quinoa is very good but you get a lot!  If you are thinking of trying it for the first time I recommend trying one box at a more expensive price to see if you like and if you like it go with the 12 box size order. I have bought different versions of Quinoa at a local Trader Joe's and Whole Foods at about $4 a box.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/text: Quinoa cooks rather quickly and easily; it is tasty and there are many recipes, ways to fix it, and ways to season it; it is healthy, has lots of protein and iron; and I have heard that it is a "wise old grain".<br /><br />1) Quinoa cooks rather quickly and easily.  From what I've read, the harvesters or processors have to remove an outer bitter "shell" from it and wash the Quinoa really good.  Therefore, I guess it looks as if they do most of the work; all we have to do is cook and eat it!  And it only takes about 15-20 minutes to cook, which isn't bad at all.<br /><br />2) It is tasty.  There are many recipes and ways to fix it.  It can be eaten hot (as a side dish or as a cereal), or cold as a salad.  There are many ways in which it can be seasoned.  At the natural store, I ate some quinoa that was cold (in the form of a "salad"), it was seasoned with mustard (and I'm sure other seasonings as well); the mustard could be tasted and made it really tasty!  I mentioned it could be eaten hot as a side dish - it can also be eaten hot as a main dish.<br /><br />3) It is healthy.  It has lots of protein and iron.  You can the nutritional facts and see how healthy it is.  It is also considered a "complete protein", which is very uncommon among the plant foods.<br /><br />4) I have heard that it is a "wise old grain".  I know that it is several thousands of years old.  I have heard that it has a natural resistance against pests (which I guess means no pesticides are needed).  I would like to find a good, informative book about Quinoa and read about it, as I have heard that it is a wondrous food.<br /><br />I could be wrong, but I don't think it is something you can grow in your own back yard.  I think it has to have a certain type of climate, from what I remember reading about it.<br /><br />Anyway, this particular brand, Ancient Harvest, has good Quinoa; I've had no problems with it.  I plan to look and see what other products this particular brand has to offer.

We purchased another brand that wasn't pre-washed or rinsed and it kind of tasted like soap....Ancient Harvest does a perfect rinsing job and it tastes delicious.  I usually mix it with some elk or deer [lean hamburger would work great also], fresh and canned diced tomato, onion, brown rice and black beans.  One box makes ALOT and my neighbors are also enjoying the large portions that it makes.

review/summary: Bitter and full of detritus
review/text: I've been through many boxes of Ancient Harvest Quinoa, since I love quinoa and for a long time this was the only brand I could find. It suffers from two main problems.<br /><br />First, quinoa naturally grows with a layer of saponins, which are bitter and indigestible. Most brands of quinoa, including Ancient Harvest, are pre-washed to remove the saponins. However, Ancient Harvest doesn't do a very good job. Unless you rinse the grains even more, they'll still taste bitter. (If you cook it in a lot of water, as you would pasta, it's okay. But cooking it like rice requires more washing.)<br /><br />Second, and much worse, Ancient Harvest does a terrible job of sorting their grains. Every bag has little pieces of stem or other detritus. Even if you spend a bunch of time picking through the grains (and who wants to do that?), expect a couple of unpleasantly crunchy mouthfuls as you bite into a twig. This makes it unsuitable to serve to company, unless you like embarrassment.<br /><br />There are better brands out there that don't have these problems. I'd recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDG3UE">Bob's Red Mill</a>, which so far has had consistently good quality.
