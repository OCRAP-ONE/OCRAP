review/summary: Wrong kibble
review/text: I specifically ordered the Whiskas Dry Cat food in the original selection.  Recently the company has redone their kibble and my cats do not like it as well.  This was listed a :"original Whiskas" and one of the reviews even said they had the same experience.  they were glad to find the older version and so was I.  If I had wanted the new kibble,, I would have bought it at my grocery,,, incidentially cheaper than on this site.  Surprise,,,, guess what was sent,,,,, the new version.  Since I suspected it was the wrong thing,, I had to open the bag to verifiy it.  Of course,, it was the new smaller kibble I could get anywhere.  So I guess,,, you all are not very careful of your orders or you just think we are dumb.

review/summary: Not so great
review/text: The primary problem with this food is it's high concentration of corn--cats are meat eaters and ideally most of their food should be meat. This food substitutes corn as a filler. Over half of this product is most likely corn filler. This is pretty standard for cat food at this price level. They also use the less preferred method of safety testing their product. The best thing is to do actual feed tests where in a laboratory they feed cats the food and see if it's nutritionally adequate or if it kills them. Instead this product is chemically analyzed in a laboratory and certified "safe" that way. This testing is inadequate and results in death for many people's pets. No evaluation is made of whether the food is digestible or not, if it is contaminated with poisons, toxins, or heavy metals. Chances are this food won't kill your cat, but since they stopped feed testing, there's no way to know if future batches are safe.<br /><br />The nicest things I can say:<br />The high filler means it firms up runny stools moderately well.<br />It's somewhat better nutritionally than most generic grocery store brands

review/summary: Nothing but garbage.
review/text: There is nothing in this product worth feeding to a cat.  It will make your cat dull, fat, unhealthy, and sleepy.  Look at the ingredients and notice how much corn and other grain materials there are and not much real meat.  Look at the ingredients in pet food and avoid corn and wheat and by products.  Try Innova Evo, it is the best food there is.

review/text: We've recently tried a number of the other coffees from this brand (French Roast Paupua New Guinea - favorite!, Dark Brazilian - v. good, etc), and this one was our least favorite.  I gave the entire bag to a coworker, after making about 5 pots, and not enjoying any of them. The flavor is too light, and has a strange aftertaste.  This appears to be a lighter roast, and I prefer a darker French Roast.

review/summary: Good product, BPA fears no longer an issue
review/text: ****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6LVS">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM395E">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>, (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.

review/summary: Loyal Earths Best Customer
review/text: I absolutely love Earths Best foods. They have the largest variety of organic foods at the best prices. The 'gourmet' flavors are slightly more expensive at my grocery store, so I thought I would give Amazon a try. The order was perfect. My son (8 months) absolutely loves the gourmet flavors.  I also like the consistency of these flavors. It is 'mid-range': not too watery (like Earths Best Chicken & Rice flavor) but not too thick.

review/summary: Love the product but cheaper at BRU
review/text: I love these variety packs.  My only complaint is that you can get them cheaper at BRU (I found them for $9.99 for a 12 pack, regular price). That's the only reason I gave them 3 stars. But as far as the actual baby food goes, I don't feel like I could be buying anything better for my baby.  I make all of his fruit and vegetable baby food myself but I was a little overwhelmed at trying to do the meat ones.  I wanted to buy all organic but I live in a very small town and didn't want to mess with trying to find the closest place to get organic/hormone free/antibiotic free meat.  Not to mention the price and all the work to make it.  The ingredients in this baby food are all real, whole, organic foods.  No preservatives, nothing extra.  So easy!

review/summary: Favorite baby food set!
review/text: So far this has been my favorite baby food to serve my 10 month old.  We do a lot of homemade baby food, but being a busy mom of 2 I also buy a lot of jars now.  Will only do organic brands, and really like Earths Best brand because of their good combos and I like that they come in a glass jar.  I really like the gourmet meals pack, my baby liked all of the ones in this pack right from the start, even though he didn't love some of the plainer vegetable or meat dinners.  So I've been willing to pay slightly more to get the gourmet meals set.  Good way to get good protein sources into babies too.

Some absorbic acid. I highly recommend the product.<br /><br />I do not, however, recommend buying it here. The "regular" price that is crossed out is absolutely absurd. I have not seen this product over $10 in any store. Perhaps that's the price in NYC.

review/text: My 9 month old has been happily eating fruit and whole grain combo as well as veggie and meat foods from Earth's Best.  These "gourmet" flavors sounded fun but she spat out and flatly refused to eat any of the four flavors in this multi pack.  I tasted them myself and they were pretty gross.  Somewhat annoying since I now have the remainder of this multipack sitting around.  That'll teach me to buy a whole pack untested!

review/text: I just received a box of these and almost half of them were either frozen and thawed, or packaged wrong. They weren't a creamy consistency at all, but chunky and watery. I have used Earth's Best for quite a while and never had any like this. We did just have a snow storm and it might have come through some icy conditions, but I had to throw half of them out. The other half looked fine. All the lids popped open, so the seals were fine. I have no idea what was wrong, but I won't be ordering these again.

review/text: Purchased for my 6-month-old & as you know babies tend to fluctuate in their interest for what they're eating. My baby enjoys this gourmet food however he does not like the Tender Beef Spinach . . . no matter what I've tried in changing the flavor (such as adding a fruit as a side dish), he still won't eat it. It's strange because he loves spinach, go figure. I've tasted all 4 flavors & they taste great to me. I rated 4-stars for this product only because my baby did not like nor would he eat the Tender Beef Spinach (even though I enjoyed the taste).

It can be difficult to find baby food with iron-rich beef that our baby actually likes, so we're happy with this one.

review/text: I chose this brand of baby food as I dont have enough time to prepare my own. Organic and nice it seemed. It states from 6 months and up. My son is 7 months. All of a sudden he started drinking large amounts of water which lead me to look closer at the label. There is up to 20 mg of sodium in these things!! A baby under 1 year has no kidney function and cannot eat salt! THen all of a sudden he had break outs in his face. Happened twice. I looked at what he had eaten those two times. SPINACH! A baby under one year should NOT have spinach! I am absolutely puzzled how a company producing food for babies, have no idea about the most general of knowledge concerning babies. I have taken my son off this food and am making my own and can only hope I have not damaged his little body by these two weeks of eating "Earths Best Organic"!

review/summary: improper seal = botulism risk!
review/text: I ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it.  I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!<br /><br />These are 2nd foods but please note that they're much more watery than Gerber or Beech-Nut 2nd foods.  I think the watered texture frustrates my son and I spill it everywhere when I feed him.  He likes the flavors fine except for the Chicken Mango Risotto (hates it).

Well...these he will eat and I am very great-full! However, they do not have the best smell (definitely not something I would eat). :) Will be purchasing more.

review/summary: Corgi Cocaine
review/text: We cut these up into small pieces for our Corgi pup (so each treat actually becomes 8-10 mini treats) to prevent throwing off his diet.  This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!

review/text: These liver chunks are like crack for dogs. The niblets are magic for training dogs because the critters will do anything for these. Although freeze-dried liver is pricey, you can cut the chunks into tiny chinks and use while training, rewarding, or just saying, 'I love you, my good dog.'

review/summary: Liv-r licious!
review/text: My dog trainer recommended this to our obedience class. I found the best price here on Amazon, and my puppy LOVES the treats. Great training treats if used in moderation (too much organ meat isn't good for anyone). Also excellent if you put some of the treats in a container with non-liver treats/cookies. Use the container as a shaker to help train your dog to come, and the other treats get a liver flavored (dust) coating that makes your dog love them even more! No limit on liver dusted treats!<br /><br />Two paws up for this stuff!

review/text: My three very finicky dogs love this product, and I like the way I can cut them up into small pieces for training.  There is only one ingredient in this: liver, all sourced within the United States, so I feel confident and safe giving this to my dogs.  I buy this on a regular basis.  It's priced better than any pet supply store I've seen, even the larger chains.  Qualifies for free shipping, which is also nice.

review/text: My dogs love these... either straight up, or crumbled on food they would otherwise not eat.  They don't get sick of them and almost never ever reject them.  They do quite often reject other treats, and certainly after a while of the same other treats.  But then tend to always enjoy these. In fact, I have to be careful not to over feed them these because I don't know if they are healthy to eat in quantity.  Certainly not for my wallet.  They do last a LONG time though, especially compare to their weight.  However, dogs wolf them down quite quickly.  I highly recommend you reward you doggies with some!

review/summary: Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried, Best Part Of Rudy's Day
review/text: I was intially introduced to Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats at my veterinarian's office.  Rudy, our Jack Russell Terrior, usually not all that interested in dog treats, responded like I'd never seen before!<br /><br />I bought a couple of cans (they are pretty pricey), but gave them to him sparingly. The tricks he'd do for the Pro-Treats were really entertaining.  Now, Rudy has to take meds. for his glaucoma and thank heavens I found the large size here which is a good value, so he not only takes his medicine, but gives great tricks in return each day! He's a happy camper, despite the loss of sight in one eye.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a><br /><br />Rudy says, "They are the best part of my day!"  We think so too!  ~ CJ

review/summary: Great training treats!
review/text: Getting grain free treats for training usually leaves three options: hard biscuits (and who wants to work for those?), cooked meat (which is gross to handle), or commercial meaty grain-free treats which cost an arm and a leg.<br /><br />These on the other hand, are very affordable, not gross to handle, and the dogs think they smell AMAZING.  They work great when your dog's attention is wavering - a waff of freeze dried beef liver usually snaps them back to attention!<br /><br />Also, being as they're only beef liver, I don't feel bad feeding my dog as many as needed for training.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: I have a 2 1/2 year old black lab and these are her favorite treats! They are the best for training, my dog will do just about anything to get one of these treats. Even my 3 month old black lab puppy goes running to his kennel when I tell him to go to bed because he knows that a liver treat is coming his way. Since they are sliced small a large container of these will last a while. The only complaint I have is that my dog loves these so much that if she knows shes getting one she starts to drool, and she's not a drooler... So I gotta toss one to her quick!!

In situations where other treats fail to get our dog's attention - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019O5Z0Q">Charlee Bear Turkey Liver & Cranberry Flavored Dog Treats</a>, for example - these treats are impossible for her to ignore.  They are an incredible training aid.<br /><br />Big bonus is that they're also simple and good for the dog.  Liver is a healthy treat and is supposed to help combat weepy eyes.  Unlike most other commercial treats, this one isn't loaded with a bunch of other junk that isn't good for your dog (byproducts and the like), it's just a good ingredient that your dog will love.

review/text: I wanted a treat that was accepted and well liked for my rescue animals.<br />This is the only treat that is healthy and loved by all 4 legged beings in my home!<br />It does not contain sugar or grains or silly vegetables which virtually all treats contain. Dogs, cats and ferrets are carnivores they are not cattle to eat grain or rabbits to eat vegetables, and WHYYYY do companies add sugar,beet pulp or corn syrup to carnivore foods? It is dangerous and can cause the death of an animal with diabetes.<br />It is pretty easy to break into smaller pieces for cats and kittens with weak jaws and its wonderful to use as an aid to gain the trust of an abused dog as it will not cause stomach upset when given in common sense amounts.<br />I like that it goes a long way as it costs alot to heal and maintain and train abused and rescued dogs.<br />NO minus to this product other then the price,I can not afford to use it as much as I would like.

review/summary: dogs LOVE it--  best treat for rewards and training
review/text: Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%

review/text: When you first give them out, be careful, you might just draw back a nub! Our oldest dog was very nonchalant about her treats. We just about had to beg her to eat them. NOT THESE. She went nuts over these and looked forward to them every night. The vet said I should give her liver to build her red blood cells up. It helped buy us a little longer with her I think. Now the other 2 dogs are addicted to them also! It is a HEALTHY treat that they love. They would eat the whole tub in one sitting if I would let them! It has no awful liver smell either!

review/summary: Great product
review/text: These liver treats are great for training. We adopted a German Shepherd puppy and have been using these to teach her basic commands. She goes bananas for these and learned very quickly even though she's a VERY stubborn pup. Since she's still small I cut the large cubes into thirds or quarters(she doesn't know and doesn't mind)to make our training sessions go further since it's recommended that you give only a few treats a day to avoid digestion problems. Also, compared to other liver treats on the market, this brand only uses 100% beef liver, no preservatives, fillers, or other stuff your dog doesn't need. The treats also keep indefinitely in the container if kept in a cool, dry place. The 21 oz. bucket is the most economical buy. We've had our pup 2+ months and the bucket is still mostly full. (Psst! - KV Pet Supply has the best online price- $24.99 for a 21oz. container) Highly recommended!

review/text: I have been feeding my greyhounds these treats for years.  My hounds can be a little finicky, but they love these treats.  They are expensive, relative to other biscuits, but I find they are a good addition to their diet.  The treats are easy on the teeth.  Since they are protein treat, be careful not to overindulge your pet on a regular basis.  They are great treats to take on walks as you can stuff them in your pocket easily.  I have found prices can vary from vendor to vendor, so shop around.

If you carry some around in your pocket like I do when I'm working with them, watch out - you will have the neighborhood dogs wanting a treat too.  :) The price here is quite good also. It is definitly worth a try!

review/summary: Size inconsistent, needs water
review/text: My dog enjoys these treats in moderation.  Because they are dried, he seems to enjoy them less the more he eats them.  With water, the treats may be much more flavorful.  After having a fair amount, he starts to lose interest in them until he can drink.<br /><br />This brings me to a question regarding serving size.  The container recommends 2-3 cubes per day for a medium breed.  The issue I'm having is that the size of the cubes is so very inconsistent.  Some bits are the size of a pea while others of a grape.  The rest are a variety of sizes in between.  Some consistency would be preferred.<br /><br />Also, this product comes highly recommended for training because it is low in fat.  My dog certainly won't learn anything with just 2-3 of these per day.  Like most dogs, he is highly motivated by food so 20-30 treats is more accurate.  To make this possible, I have to dice them up into smaller pieces or shift through to find the little bits.<br /><br />At least these treats are natural and thus healthier than some of the other options.  I just didn't expect to have to prepare them first.

review/summary: Great for travel, but too expensive, too much prep
review/text: These are great training treats when you need something lightweight that won't make a mess of your pockets. I have a couple problems with them though. First, they are too expensive for every day training. Second, the sizes are so inconsistent that you need to cut some of the large cubes up (at this price, they should be ready-to-eat). Actually there is a third, which is that the powder leftover on the bottom is useless to me.<br /><br />I've found it much cheaper to just put some sliced beef liver from the store in the oven and bake till dry. Cut it up, put it in small portions, and freeze. My dog likes it better than the freeze-dried anyway. I do a whole bunch at a time so I am not prepping frequently. But I figure if I have to prep something, it might as well be something cheap!

review/summary: Two paws up!
review/text: My dog goes bonkers for these treats! They seem to be crazy delicious. Some of the pieces are so small, Lulu doesn't have to chew them; she seems to swallow them whole. I wonder how she even tastes them! But she must, because she whines and acts like a obnoxious brat every time I go near the bucket.<br /><br />I like that the treats don't have any additives. They really stink, though, and the smell stays on your fingers. The smell and the price are the only downsides. Also, I wish the container said how many calories the treats have so I could compare them to other natural treats like Fruitables. The vet said Lulu is getting fat (to which I replied "Yo momma is fat!") and that we should start watching her calories.<br /><br />If you're curious about the consistency of the size of the pieces, please see the photos I posted. There's some variation in size, and when I tip the bucket, I see more crumbly pieces at the bottom, but I don't foresee Lulu turning her nose up at them!

review/text: I buy a big tub of these for my dog about every 3-4 months. He loves them. I do mix them in with other treats, so he does not get a steady diet of them. They are given out as the "special" treat, being one notch above a standard, wheat-free dog cookie.<br /><br />While these are great treats, they are not as "hypnotic" as real meat is. And, given the price, and how inexpensive some good-quality meat is at the grocery store, if you truly want to mesmerize your dog, go with real meat. Its pretty funny that so many of us are paying $7-9 for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about $4-5 a pound.<br /><br />However, most of us don't want slimy hands all day, so we use treats. I use these out when walking my dog, and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes. I like them because they are feather light, but just don't get them wet or they turn to mush. My dog's interest in them after they get wet goes down a lot.<br /><br />I do wish the pieces were more uniformly sized, but they aren't too hard to break apart.
