review/summary: My daughter loves it !
review/text: We tried this product sample at my daughter's daycare and she loved it. So I ordered a pack from amazon (along with another item to get the supersaver s/h discount) and its a nice treat for her. She calls it "fruit jelly". I tasted it and like it too !

review/summary: not what I expected
review/text: We love Clif kid Z bars.  I decided to try these based on all of the great reviews.  We bought the strawberry and no one in the house likes them.  My kids are picky, so I always try the treats just to see if they are even worth trying.  I eat healthy and don't mind most healthy snacks, but even I did not care for these.  I am going to try another flavor, but the strawberry just didn't cut it here!

review/summary: Not clear advertising - just flavored apple in Variety pack!
review/text: This is for the variety pack. The good: it is all organic and contains no sugar, the taste is quite good. The 'wish I knew this before' and it is not mentioned in the product description online here, which I find misleading. The ingredients for ALL 4 flavors is the SAME: Organic Apple Puree, Organic Apple Juice concentrate, Organic Flavor, Pectin, (and coloring). I really thought that this was pure dried Mixed Berry, Strawberry, Tropical Fruit and yes, Sour Apple).But the ingredient list on the box shows it is all apple. I prefer the Fruit 'Ends & Bits' at Trader Joe's

review/text: These are alright, very sticky and chewy, a bit sour, way too sweet. My 9 year old guy is a candy junky, to the horror of his mother, but even with the awful sweetness of these things, he only ate the sour apple...said the other flavors sucked.<br />If you're into paying a ton of money for sugar with a bit of fruit and tons of plastic packaging, both these and Stretch Island fruit leathers would fit your needs. Although, Stretch Island has more fruity flavor without the sickening sweetness.

They love the taste and I love that they are a nice healthy snack for after school or on the go.<br />I must say though that both myself and my mom thought they had very strong "pucker power". Too sour of a taste for us. I guess it just depends if you like sour flavors.

review/summary: Children LOVE these!
review/text: The first time we ordered the Clif Kid Twisted Fruit Ropes we ordered the Variety Pack to sample all the flavors so we could make a better decision when ordering the next pack.  While my seven-year-old enjoyed every flavor very much, strawberry came out slightly ahead in taste.  This time when we received the strawberry-only pack he was thrilled to have a whole box of his favorite but still hoped for a bit of variety.  While he is an avid fan of the flavor of these fruit twists, I am a fan of the ingredients and am happy to serve them to him.  The wholesome ingredients of the Strawberry flavor are as follows: Organic Apple Puree, Organic Apple Juice Concentrate, Organic Flavors, Pectin, Colored with Fruit and Vegetable Juice.<br /><br />These fruit twists make a great alternative to the fruit snacks his friends seem to always get in their lunchbox but are a much healthier choice.  If my son is not able to finish his lunch (which seems to be the case most days with the school's 10-15 minute time allotment for lunch) after school during pick-up he will take the fruit twists out of his lunchbox and the other children beg him to trade with him.  Most times he refuses because he enjoys them so much.  I will be re-buying these and packing these in his lunch every once in awhile for a treat.  However, when ordering again I will probably choose the Variety Pack as you get a 24 pack for the same price as a single flavored 18 pack.<br /><br />My personal opinion of the product's flavor is that it is delicious but a bit too sour/tart/tangy.  I can't eat them on a regular basis but my child who loves sour/tart fruit and the occasional sour candy says it is perfect.  Additionally, the product does have a tendency to stick to the teeth.  My child's molars are sealed and he has never had a cavity so it is not an issue for our family but may be something to consider in your purchase.

review/text: This is a pretty good product -- scores well on nutrition, good texture (chewy, but in a good way), serving size is reasonable for a 70 calorie product. But, the taste is on the tart side and rather weak in terms of tasting like strawberry. It's not "pucker your mouth" tart, but dialing the tartness back would make it a 5 star product.

review/text: The fruit twists in the first package received were stale as compared to twists we have bought in a health food store. This months' automatic shipment was better, but two of the individually wrapped sticks were torn and/or open, so we had to discard them.<br /><br />We plan to keep the auotmatic shipment for one more month and see if the condition of the product is better.  The product itself is good, but if we find it fresher in the store we won't continue to buy it here.

Sticky/chewy/tart/odd flavor is how I'd describe it.  I bought it after reading the good reviews but it's just too strange a taste for us to ever repurchase or to justify that high price.

review/summary: Real fruit, unreal flavors.
review/text: I was expecting the  strawberry flavored CLIF kid Organic Twisted Fruit to contain strawberries, but the ingredient list doesn't mention strawberries at all. It is made from organic apple puree and apple juice concetrate and "organic flavors" (whatever that means).<br />The list of vitamins and minerals is rather extensive, and I don't doubt the "One Serving of Fruit" claim is valid. So it is a relatively healthy snack.<br />How does it taste? Very tart with a flavor similar to old strawberry preserves.<br />Will kids eat it? Yes. After trying one, my daughter took a few to school with her.

review/summary: Tasty, but doesn't leave you full; high calories, expensive.
review/text: The Clif bar organic fruit comes in a plastic wrapper that is easy to open so kids (or adults with frail hands) wont have any trouble opening it.  The actual piece of nourishment is only a few inches long as is very sticky so you don't want to get your hands on it<br /><br />There's a slightly spicy, fruity taste to the strawberry flavor I consumed.  I was able to chomp down on the stick in a matter of seconds and I was left not feeling full either.  I could easily eat several of these in one sitting -- but you wouldn't want to do that as these have 70 calories a piece.  If children are consuming these you really need to watch out that they don't have access to too many as they too could easily eat several of these in front of a TV (will make them FAT).<br /><br />Overall, I am not happy about the high calorie count versus feeling of fullness.  Even a granola bar leaves me far more satisfied, but these fruit sticks do no such thing.  The prices is also high, being about 90 cents a piece when bought in the bulk pack.  I would like to see the price decrease to 50 cents a piece at least.  As such, I am awarding only 3 stars to this product.

review/summary: Best thing since Sliced Bread....Awesome !!!
review/text: I am not a big fan of fruit roll-ups as they tend to be more like candy than fruit with added sugar. These Twisted Fruit ropes are a "whole" other story. They are Organic and provide ONE FULL Serving of Fruit! Each one is 70 calories and best of it, they are satisfying. And I love its dense, chewy texture. It's SO GOOD that I enjoy it as much as my children do ! So far, I have had the pleasure of trying the strawberry, sour apple, and tropical fruit twists. I love them all although the sour apple is indeed "sour". It will make your mouth pucker which I personally love but I buy the strawberry & tropical flavors for my children. I just wish that they were less expensive but I can see how they cost more to produce so I am willing to pay more to get a better, more nutritious fruit snack ! Btw, Amazon has the best prices on these esp. if you "subscribe and save". They are not yet readily available and at my Whole Foods Supermarket, they sell for 99 cents EACH !

review/summary: Meh
review/text: We got the twenty-four-piece multi-pack, which comes with four flavors: Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, Strawberry, and Sour Apple.<br /><br />The ingredients for the Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, and Strawberry are:<br />"organic apple puree, organic apple juice concentrate, organic flavor, pectin, colored with fruit and vegetable juice."  Also, some vitamins and minerals are added.<br /><br />Sour Apple ingredients are exactly the same, except there is no coloring added.<br /><br />The "organic flavor" ingredients are not specified, nor are the fruit and vegetable juices used for color.  We can assume that these ingredients do vary among the different flavored fruit ropes, but we don't know what they are.<br /><br />These fruit ropes do not have the fruit taste we thought they should.  Our family didn't like them very much.  They aren't terrible -- we just don't think they're good enough to purchase again; but maybe that's just because we're accustomed to natural foods.<br /><br />The ingredients aren't bad either, but they're nothing exciting -- as far as we can tell, they're just apple (pectin comes from apples) with anonymous color and flavor enhancers (and the supplemental vitamins and minerals).<br /><br />Additionally, among the Tropical Twist flavored fruit ropes were several that had not been packaged properly.  The ropes were sticking out the bottoms of the wrappers, having been squished along with the wrapper when the machinery pressure/heat sealed them.<br /><br />The reviewers who thought these were very chewy must have gotten stale ones.  The fresh ones are on the softer side, but still sticky.  (Braces wearers, beware.)<br /><br />For small, individually-wrapped dried fruit treats, I would recommend Stretch Island fruit leather instead.  These contain the fruits named in their flavors (e.g. the ingredients in Stretch Island's "orchard cherry" fruit leather are: apple puree concentrate, cherry puree concentrate, orange puree concentrate, natural black cherry flavor) and they taste like those fruits, too, without being too sweet or tart or sticky.

It's so hard to find snacks for him and we went to a birthday party where somebody packed these in the goody bags.  We were surprised when we looked at the ingredients and found out he can actually eat them and doesn't have to feel left out while the other kids eat it.  The hardest ingredient to get away from in these type of snacks is high fructose corn syrup which this product doesn't contain.

review/summary: Whether you're grown or growing, this is the YUMMIEST fruit snack going!
review/text: I'm not exactly a kid (born December 5, 1967, you do the math)but I had to try these things when I saw them in my local natural-foods market, and they are PLENTY OF YUMMY. Sweet yet zingy, fruity-fresh flavor, firm but tender texture. Each twist "candy" is 70 calories and 1 point on Weight Watchers, and unlike conventional fruit snacks, these take some time to enjoy, so they're more satisfying. These are a snack to be savored. Now I'm hooked on the things. I tried the Tropical Twist and the Mixed Berry so far (I like to buy them individually, so I don't mow through the box in one sweep!) Both are delish, but the Tropical Twist is an eyelash ahead. Looking forward to trying the other flavors.<br />  I don't have kids yet, but I would recommend them to my little cousin-nieces (my cousin's daughters)<br />  These are great to take on the go. Just slip into pocket or purse.<br />  A fitness-friendly, tastebud-tantalizing way to slap your mouth sideways with a wallop of fruit!  I recommend them highly

review/text: Finally, a great tasting fruit snack without added Sugar and/or High Fructose Corn Syrup. Clif has released something tasty that I can eat without being the equivalent of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NT69XU">Snickers Bar</a>. It makes a great late night and on the go snack. While it's strawberry flavored (Yes, The review is based on the strawberry flavor), it doesn't taste a thing like strawberries. It tastes as artificial <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OIT8T2">Skittles</a> but it isn't artificial and that's a beautiful thing. And While non-strawberry tasting strawberry flavor (At least I didn't think it tasted like strawberry) may be a minus for some people, for me, a person who doesn't like the taste of real strawberry, that's a plus. The shape of the rope is just like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UHADL4">Red Vines</a> and if you've had the strawberry red vines, the taste isn't that much different. And for kids, if you remove the individual wrappers and place them in a Ziploc Bag, I doubt a child would be able to tell the difference to this and a piece of licorice. I placed a few in an empty <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UHADL4">Red Vines</a> bag, my 9 year old nephew got into them, didn't know the difference.<br /><br />PROS<br />1. Great for kids lunches or a late night snack<br />2. 70 calories<br />3. No Extra sugar and/or High Fructose corn syrup or artificial sweetner<br />4. Organic And All Natural<br />5. 100 percent fruit with great taste<br /><br />CONS<br />1. Not so big on the strawberry flavor.<br /><br />To sum it all up, If you're looking for a nutritious snack for your kids, This is perfect

review/text: Great product. I have been enjoying them as much as my son. They are not too tough to chew like many of the natural fruit products I've tried. These flavors have a slight tart taste that we enjoy.  I'll be ordering more. The Cliff Kid's cereal bars are also a winner.

review/summary: Great product but now has more sugar
review/text: I used to order these for my daughter and husband since they had 9 grams of sugar in them which is comparable to the fruit chews you buy in the store but without all of the colored dyes. Sad to discover in my last order that the sugar is now up to 15 grams per stick which is too much. I confirmed with CLIF and they said they raised the sugar because that is what the customers wanted so we no longer buy these now. Just a note for those watching how much sugar their kids are getting.

review/text: I bought these Cliff Kids Twisted Fruit Ropes for my son.  He did not care for them, but I (his Mother) love them.  They should take the word  "kid" off the label and leave them as just Clif Twisted Fruit Ropes!  They are conveniently packaged so that I can put one or two in my purse for when I need a quick, nutritional snack while on the go!  They are about the size of a pen and just slip right in my purse.  I buy these for me now.....not my kid.  These taste great!!!!

review/summary: Good Alternative to Candy
review/text: I have been eating Clif Bars for years now, so when I saw that they were making fruit snacks I had to give them a try.  Each stick is individual wrapped and has 70 calories all from Carbs, there is also a gram of Fiber, some Potassium and a few other vitamins and minerals for good measure, so compared to just 100% sugar candy, this is not too bad of a choice.  The sugar is also from Organic Juices so you don't have to worry about pesticides or preservatives or anything like that.<br /><br />As far as the taste, they are a little tart, but not too bad.  They are very chewy and sticky, one of my friends has braces and they had a very hard time eating this without most of it just sticking somewhere in the braces.  So all-in-all, I would recommend these if you like chewy fruit flavored candy and want something better, but you should still use them sparely because eating just carbs only gives a very short energy burst and then without any healthy fats or proteins you crash soon after, so have a handful of nuts or something similar to help balance out the components some.

review/text: I try to choose healthy snacks when I have the option, and I was pleased to see this brand available in a variety pack.  While these fruit snacks are easy to tote around and very good for you, the taste and texture missed the mark with me.  All of the flavor varieties were a bit too tough and chewy.  The green apple was tart enough to make my eyes water, but the other three flavors were fairly good.

review/summary: fruit candy great idea
review/text: I personally like the flavor of these twisted fruit sticks and more importantly my kids enjoy them also. (two and four years old). Basically these are like fruit roll ups with a heavy concentration of fruit juice that gives him a strong tart flavor. Their texture is similar to soft licorice in addition they throw in a few vitamins but not so many that you have to worry about toxicity. I also tried their mixed berry flavor and would definitely recommend strawberry.<br /><br />I feel adults can use these as a healthier candy or my kids can eat these with a lower probability of creating a mess that sometimes occurs with fruit roll up treats.

review/summary: Two reviews in one! ...  from a mom & her son
review/text: MOM'S REVIEW:<br />Fruit rope doesn't sound all that appealing. Twisted fruit sounds a little better. It really doesn't matter what these little twists of fruit are called because they are YUMMY! Upon opening the package, I found a dark dark red twisty fruit rope. It looks as if you took good fruit leather, and rolled them up and twisted them. They don't LOOK delicious which maybe makes that first bite taste even better. It has this sweet, tart, pure strawberry taste and a texture that reminds me a bit of al dente firmness of pasta but these are much thicker, of course.<br /><br />I like that there are less calories than a can of pop/soda or even orange juice, and has a full serving of fruit. It's low in sugar, too. Now, REAL strawberries are much better for you but on the go, or in a backpack, these are a pretty good choice.<br /><br />KID'S REVIEW:<br />They have an awesome taste. I would recommend these to everyone. The texture of them kinda isn't that appealing to me but once I took a bite I was hooked. I think they could have been made a little bigger but could be a great snack for football games, soccer games, tennis meets, etc. That's all.

review/text: These strawberry fruit sticks are great!  Organic ingredients, the equivalent of one serving of fruit, 70 calories, and very tasty.  They remind me of Twizzler twists in the way that they look.<br /><br />These are not a really sweet snack.  They are actually a little tart.  One grandmother used to make homemade strawberry fruit roll-ups from dried strawberries (no sugar added, I don't think), and these snacks remind me very much of those.  I really like them, but if you are buying them for someone with a big sweet tooth, then they might not be as big of a hit.

review/summary: Tasty Snack
review/text: I got the Sour Apple version of the Clif Kid Twisted fruit, and even though I'm not a "Kid" exactly, I still take these to work for lunch.  They do taste good.  The first two ingredients are Apple Puree and Apple Juice, and the rest of the ingredients are added vitamins & minerals (plus pectin and wax to give the juice and puree structure).  Yes I know, these are full of sugar - apple juice concentrate is another way of saying "sugar - apple flavored".  But as far as a sugary treat goes, this one at least has some vitamins and even a smidge of fiber hidden inside.  It's tasty and I get my candy craving out of the way.  It's mostly organic, so I don't have to worry about my treat putting pesticides into the environment.  Maybe a real apple is better for you, but this will do in a pinch.

review/text: I realize that these snacks sort of straddle the line between fruit and candy, but they are better than most "fruit roll-up" type snacks with all the added sugar. At least these ones have no added sugar and are mostly fruit.<br /><br />My kids like all four of the flavors in the multi-pack, including the Sour Apple which I had thought they would reject. I personally find it way too sour for me but they love it!<br /><br />These snacks are individually wrapped which makes them great for tossing in a lunchbox or taking along on outings. And they are thicker and chewier than most "fruit leather" or similar type snacks, which makes them more satisfying to eat. I find them a pretty good compromise in terms of price, nutrition value, and taste.

We got the variety pack and haven't had a bad flavor in the entire box. They are super fruity, slightly tart, but still sweet. The texture isn't too soft or gummy. They're just right. These make great snacks for school or anytime. I'll definitely be ordering them again and again.

review/text: We purchased the variety pack (strawberry, mixed berry, tropical, and sour apple) and overall are quite pleased with these. My daughter really enjoys the strawberry, berry and tropical flavors. However, no one likes the apple. It's not the sour factor (I love sour things), there's a weird bitter aftertaste in this particular flavor that's not appealing. I love how dense and chewy each rope is; they're surprisingly filling and are a very nice healthy alternative to the regular 'fruit' rolls on the market. We'll definitely be buying these again, although next time I'll buy each flavor separately to avoid the apple.

review/summary: delicious and no added sugar!
review/text: I would highly recommend these in place of fruit rolls ups or other gummy fruit snacks that are full of sugar. These are all fruit, no added sugar and have a strong, excellent, fruity-tarty taste. I like them as much as my granddaughter. Walmart used to carry them. I requested that they continue stocking them but have not had any luck. So I have to purchase them from Amazon.com. A bit expensive but delicious and healthy!

review/summary: Great fruit snack!
review/text: These are absolutely wonderful.  Well- my son likes them, anyhow... I don't really.<br />But, they are so much healthier than the awful fruit snack you can buy in the grocery store.  There is nothing in these besides fruit.  I am not a 'health nut'- but I do try to avoid high fructose corn syrup, and unnecessary sugar.  Which makes getting things for my son's lunch very difficult.<br /><br />Anyhow, my son has one of these in his lunch almost every day.  His teacher noticed that his fruit snack was actually made of fruit- and so has been recommending them to parents- (his school has a 'no candy' lunch policy, and the fruit snacks that you can buy in the grocery store fall into the candy group).<br /><br />They are expensive.  I don't particulary like them myself (I've never liked fruit snacks of any sort though, so that isn't indicitive of the product's worth at all!).  I find that they leave my son with sticky hands.<br /><br />Even with those negative points- they are still a 5 star snack.  They are healthy, and my son loves them- what more I can ask?

review/summary: Great fruit snacks; not just for kids
review/text: It's nice to see Clif branching out into a different range of products (like not just energy bars) without sacrificing the quality of ingredients that go into them.  These fruit snacks were great; nice flavor, not too small or too big, and obviously made from real strawberries.  There's not much else to say, other than that I'm not a kid and I'd buy these for myself.  Don't judge me!

review/text: One of our favorite treats especially on the go and it's good for you.  One of these fruit ropes meets the daily requirement for a piece of fruit.  Obviously, it is best to eat fresh fruit.  If you don't have the time or have a little one who is picky, then these are great.  Mixed Berry and Strawberry are my favorites with just the right mix of sweet and tart.  Personally, I can't stand the Sour Apple, but luckily my kid likes it.  Looking forward to trying all of the other flavors!

review/summary: "Daddy the fruit rope makes my tummy hurt."
review/text: What can I say, I got caught up when this was a gold box item and I didn't take the time to research the product.  Essentially these 0.7 ounce about 60 cent each fruit ropes are pulverized apple guts and apple juice with a few other vitamins and flavors.  They may be organic, but they weren't well received in our house.  The line above is from my three year old after she ate one. We'll stick to real fruit (fresh and dried) from now on.

review/summary: our "candy"
review/text: While I was pregnant with my son I constantly carried fruit leather. Not this product, but similar. Remembering and wanting some I went searching for them and found these instead. My children LOVE them. They call them candy. They are even better than the fruit leather since the texture is easier for my children. THey are good for them, taste good, and now I can use them as rewards when my children ask for Candy. Personally, I like all of the flavors I've tried (have not tried pineapple). My children have one or two each that they do not prefer, but this is all a matter of Personal Tastes. I recommend these to everyone I know with children as a candy substitute and to all of my friends as a healthy snack to carry around that will also satisfy their sweet tooth. If you don't like the first flavor you try, try another since they really are a great product. I can not buy this brand locally for less than a $1 each, but they are worth it. Candy costs the same, so why not pay to get something Good for you?

review/text: My daughter loves these snacks. She doesn't care if something is sour she will eat it if she thinks or knows its a snack just for her. I love these because they are better for her than majority of the other fruit type snacks out there and they are organic. They aren't as sticky or messy as other items in their group either which I love. I can keep a few in my purse on busy shopping days and just hand her one is her car seat and she is happy for a good while. I recommend them to any parent looking for a healthy and tasty snack for their kids.
