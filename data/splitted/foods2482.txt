review/summary: Warning!! Valve popped off and I got sprayed in the face
review/text: Yes, Ortho Max kills bugs.  I used it once without any problems, and the leaf-hoppers, flea beetles, and mosquitoes disappeared from our yard for over a week.  But the second time I attached it to the hose, and began spraying, the red open-and-shut valve on the top of the unit popped off as water was squirting through the hose, and into the container of insecticide.  This caused the mixture to geyser upward and hit me in the face, instead of spraying out of the nozzle.<br /><br />I immediately went inside and showered and washed out my mouth (yes, my mouth happened to be open when the valve popped off).  The container was only about a quarter full of insecticide when the valve popped off, so maybe I lucked out.  At least, I didn't drop dead, immediately.  However, I strongly recommend that you don't purchase this product.  It's way too dangerous to use.

review/text: I just had the same sprayback issue as the above reviews.  The spray bottle was attached to the hose just fine but it popped off twice while spraying.  I got soaked.  I do not know how well it works killing bugs but if it takes me out I hope I take some bugs to the grave with me.

review/summary: Best stuff to get rid of ants and fleas
review/text: Sprayed a week ago and haven't seen an ant anywhere. I have to feed one of my cats outside and every time I used to put the cat bowl down, 5 minutes and the bowl was covered with ants. Now I put the cat bowl out and the cat can eat his food without any ants bothering him. He even leaves and comes back to eat his food and still no ants or fleas. AWESOME STUFF will buy this again!

review/text: Ortho needs to go back to the drawing board on this product.<br /><br />I have had nothing but problems with it and it's a complete waste of money and a huge aggravation. The yellow part that you screw the hose into pops off while you are using it causing spray back! The red cap that keeps the water shut off until you are ready to use..also pops off mid use. This product is so frustrating!!!!<br /><br />I'm also not sure any of the solution is coming out of the bottle because it's still full and I've used it every day and am covering my yard,around my house, garden beds in this stuff yet..it feels like it's only spraying water.<br /><br />In addition, when I pulled the instructions off the back the pages were stuck together and impossible to pull apart to read.<br /><br />This product is a complete Failure in design from end to end.

review/text: I read the earlier reviews about the red top coming off and spraying in face, but, since Ortho, decided to risk it as an anomaly.<br /><br />However, on the second bottle the hose connection came off several times (tried to reattach it).<br /><br />Ortho definitely has a problem with quality control on the container (and makes one wonder about the chemicals).  Expected better from this brand.  Will definitely pass over the brand name next time.  Also, price seems high.  So much for ordering online.

review/text: I have not had the sprayer issues others have mentioned. The sprayer works fine and in the thick of skeeter season this provides fantastic peace and freedom to have my morning coffee in the backyard without getting sucked dry. Not one of those little vampires in sight. It remains that way for a solid week, sometimes more. Depends on how much precipitation you get. I always apply it after dusk while fighting for my life. The next morning = :)<br /><br />It's a little pricey but worth every penny.

review/text: From the picture it looks like there is a new bottle with the valve on the side. The one I bought had the valve on the top. Just like the other reviewer, not long after I turned on the hose, the knob popped off spraying it all over me. Luckily I didn't have my face over it, only my arms and legs got covered with it. Maybe it works well, but it's not worth risking your life for.

review/text: If it works remains to be seen as I have just finished treating the exterior of my home.<br />Unfortunately the red on off knob that you rotate to begin spraying is not permanently affixed<br />to the nozzle housing.<br /><br />SO, as I am turning it off after finishing a section (30 ft away from the hose bib) the knob came off<br />resulting in------- THE SOLUTION SPRAYING FULL PRESSURE UP OUT OF THE KNOB HOLE DIRECTLY IN MY FACE!!!!<br /><br />After turning the pressure off I was easily able to reinsert the knob in to its hole and it functions perfectly.<br />No there is nothing broken. It is an obvious and potentially dangerous design flaw.<br /><br />Be careful using this product.

review/summary: No bugs on my face, hooray!
review/text: I attached the product to my hose and turned the water on, then picked up the bottle and its nozzle came off, exploding water up into my face. So I shut off the water, reattached the nozzle, opened the valve, and turned the water back on. Sprayed for a few minutes before the nozzle again flew off, spraying water and insecticide into my face and all over my body. Ran back to the spigot and turned the water off, couldn't find the gasket, so I switched to a second bottle of the same stuff. I then repeated the same experience with the second bottle. Finally emptied one entire bottle out, which felt like far too soon.<br /><br />Do not buy this product. The bottle design is determined to fail under normal use and the mixture is depleted far too quickly. I've never had these problems with Spectracide, which costs the exact same amount and covers more area. I only bought it because Spectracide wasn't available, but next time I'll just wait it out.

review/text: Me and my husband are always looking for responsible, healthy, by-product free treats for our sweet dog, but the problem we usually come across it lack of flavor and lack of excitement on our dogs part. These treats REALLY shocked us! The first time we gave it to her, she took it and bolted under the bed. The second time we gave one to her, she knew exactly what the treat was and did literally EVERY trick she knew, frantically one right after another! She is crazy about these things, so we will definitely be buying more! I would highly recommend these treats.

review/summary: Contains Carrageenan
review/text: I ordered "Super Antioxidant" Naked treats last week.  Both my dogs love them.  It's the only treat I've found so far that our dog with part of his lower jaw removed, due to oral melanoma, can and will chew.  The problem is that I now see that the treats contain "carrageenan".  Now, I will have to find another dog (or trash can) to give the treats to.  I just ordered two more bags  today.  Although common in many foods, carrageenan is supposedly a carcinogen, per healthyeatingadvisor.com.  I've read from other sources that carrageenan can cause stomach problems.  If my dog had not already suffered from oral melanoma cancer, I might not be concerned.  But, I figure why take any chances.  Per notmilk.com, it's not the seaweed that's the problem, it's the processing to turn it into carrageenan.  Just like with things like Nutrasweet, etc.  Maybe this company uses a safe process.  I'll skip giving it to my dogs, until I know for sure.  Wow, shopping for dog food gets complicated!

I give her one of these when I need to keep her busy and quiet, like while I'm working or when company comes over. I have also bribed my clients Chihuahua mix with half of one of these as she is a barker and wouldn't stop barking at people.. It worked like a charm, she took off under the couch and chewed away, ignoring everyone and making our meeting peaceful! Love these!!

review/summary: Only dental chew my dog will eat!
review/text: I've tried everything with my 7 month old corgi/chi mix.  Normally he would eat half of a new brand's bone and then wouldn't touch another one again.  He just finished this bag a few days ago... he LOVES it.  And I love it too because the ingredients are way better than most of the dental chews out there.  No animal by products; no corn, wheat, or soy which can create horrible skin allergies... just really awesome and healthy ingredients.  I already bought two more bags and will definitely be a long term customer.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />It's been a while since my dog has first tried these.  He is a SUPER picky dog, but the minute he sees me pull out this bag, he goes crazy and starts to whine for them.  I can't believe he hasn't gotten bored of it yet.  I am very glad Amazon has lowered the price on these.

review/text: Teddy (lhasa apsso) is normally quite disdainful of chew treats. However, the day I brought these home he took it from me right away and ran off happily chewing. He will normally go through about one a day (small stick), I switch it up between these ones and the  "Gut Health," by the same brand. It ordinarily takes him a few hours to chew through, but he's not the biggest chewer. I'm very glad to find a treat he'll actually eat, he's glad to chew it, and lastly, I'm glad that it seems to be comprised of quality ingredients.

I have been giving my dog these treats for over a year and he still loves them.<br /><br />Every night when I get home, he barks in front of the container where these treats (and two other dental chew treats) are stored.

He comes by, pulls them out one at a time and runs away to chew them.  He routinely chooses the Get Naked Chew Sticks first.  Later, he comes back for the other two.<br /><br />From time to time, my dog does tire of the Get Naked Chew Sticks and so, I stop giving them to him for a while.  When he tires of the other dental chews, I return to the Get Naked Chew Sticks and find he love them again.

review/text: Gnosis Chocolate is the most delicious chocolate!  And, the fact that it is a nutritious chocolate makes it even better.  On top of that, the Power Choc is packed with protein rich superfoods.  I can't say enough good things about Gnosis chocolate and the company.  It is so satisfying to finally find a product that truly raw, organic and does not contain refined sugar, soy, milk or gluten and their ingredients are of the highest quality.  Yay for Gnosis!  And, thank you for making a chocolate that I can feel good about eating!!

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: I never thought I could like canned peas. The flavor and texture are totally unexpected. A health food store owner gave us a can of these to try (for free) as he was convinced we'd love them. He was so right! Pick up a can and give them a try. You just might be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />(With regard to these being too salty, I haven't noticed that... I also don't pick up a strong aluminum taste from the can (but that's pretty typical of canned goods, I think). Maybe the company's changed some things. All I know is, we approve.)

review/summary: Quick, Easy and Delicious
review/text: I purchased this after having tried a similar product from TastyBite that comes in a pouch.  I would definitely recommend it as a quick and easy meal.  I like to throw a pot of rice on and heat a can of this for a fast and delicious meal.  They also make an easily preparable rice, but I have not tried it.  Some reviewers mentioned that it is too salty - for me, I find the seasoning to be just right (but always eat it with rice - on it's own, it would definitely be too strong).  The vegetables are quite soft, but the cheese maintains it's texture fairly well.  I believe this is the closest to "homemade" tasting food that I have ever bought that is heat and serve.

review/summary: horrible-- tastes like the can
review/text: First off, letme say  that I am not Indian, but I did live in India for 10 years. Many years ago I purchsed the Chana Masala (chick peas in sauce) and remember liking it. After many years, I recently came across Jyoti products again, and thought I'd give them a try. I bought Mattar Paneer, Sag Paneer and the yellow lentils with vegetables (carrots). All three were horrible. First of all, they all had an aluminum can flavor. They were all extremely greasy and salty. They smelled horrible. I managed to eat most of the Mattar Paneer when I mixed it with rice, but the others were inedible, mostly because of the can taste, as well as that the ingredients (vegetables, paneer etc.) being completely liquefied/mush from a can. I felt sad throwing all that food away, but I honestly couldn't get it down without feeling like I was going to get sick. I bought something from them a year ago and it was the same thing. I had just assumed it was a bad batch, clearly something else is going on with their product.

review/text: The flavor seems authentic and I liked the level of spice, BUT one serving is a whopping 510mg of salt and it tastes very very salty! If you had planned to eat the can as a meal we are talking about 2,040mg of salt. For me, the level of salt really detracted from the flavor and I hope they will consider lowering it.

review/summary: Tasty convenient meal
review/text: I've tried over a dozen different types of canned indian meals, and this is one of my favorites.  On its own, it is mild.  I always add a spoonful or two of a medium or hot indian relish or pickle (eg mango or lime).  It should be eaten with rice.  Once you mix one of these cans of food with rice, it becomes a large enough meal to be well worth the cost per can.  Like most canned foods, it has a lot of salt.  It is common for some of the cans to arrive dented (I eat them anyway).

review/summary: Love the product, consistently most cans are DENTED
review/text: I previously wrote a five-star review for this product because we really like it. We like it so much we order a case each month. We've done this for the last year. BUT, we are sooooo tired of getting a case where the majority of the cans are dented. In the last shipment, every single can was dented in some manner. It was not Amazon's fault because it was packed properly, so I can only assume that the vendor sends dented cans for those who order cases. So, this is how they treat their repeat customers?

review/summary: Excellent Indian food for Cheap
review/text: Today was my first day trying out these. I have already finished eating 3 cans of this Matar Paneer. So frickin tasty the were! I ate two cans warmed with rice and 1 just by itself. The taste comes from the spices and sour cream combination. Be warned that there is a lot of soy bean oil used to keep this from going bad. 1 can amounts to 560 calories of which 400 is from fats. I think a moderate quick meal can be eaten with half a can of this and some rice that will keep you filled for at least 3-4 hours. I found that there are only about 8-10 cubes of paneer in this thing, about as much as shown in the picture. That was kind of a let down as i like paneer. But the rest of the stuff with pleasant gravy were good enough eaten with rice. A must buy at $2.6 per delicious and fulfilling Indian meal.<br /><br />i find the salt not a problem as i work out daily and sweat away lot of salt anyway.

review/text: We were quite disappointed with this product. They arrived quickly enough but when we opened the box and viewed one of cigars it looked just awful. One can only describe it as mottled in the extreme. We then opened a second and third cigar and find they were all the same. Certainly not something we would want to pass out. The question was, 'could we safely eat these?'. We each had one and while they tasted good enough for what they represented, and we are still alive to report on the them, we still felt that by looks alone it would turn folks off. Was this a one off box? We don't know but have no intention of finding out. There are other sources for the same product.

review/summary: Suites My Needs Well.
review/text: This might seem a bit unusual, but I was in my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery and the goal was to pick up a variety of vegetarian items for use in a diet. They could be fresh, canned, pickled or dried. They all had to be low in calories and high in bulk. Of course, they would have low fat (if any) and, ideally, high fiber. To this mix, I added a variety of sources of protein. The idea was to get all ingredients the body might need, but an absolute bottom in calories. I eat all I want on this regimen and so far I've lost 9 pounds in 18 days.<br /><br />One of the items I picked up was a can of Dynasty Whole Baby Sweet Corn. I found it in the Asian foods section. I've had the baby corn mixed into a variety of Asian dishes, of course, but here I ate the mini-ears as finger foods to accompany my other items. They worked well. They were fresh and tasty and provided good bulk. They're rather bland tasting, but that didn't bother me at all. Will I come back for more? Sure, it's a good product and suits my needs well.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

The FDA says its investigation is ongoing and that it continues to test samples of the popular treats, which dog owners across the country say have caused kidney failure in their pets, resulting in severe illness or death.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: A Treat My Dog Loves
review/text: Happy Hips are one of my little monster's favorite treats.  She is a very finicky eater but she will obey and be sweet for a chance at these chip like treats.<br /><br />This product was recommended to me by another dog owner as a healthy treat because it contains no fillers, byproducts, antibiotics, or added hormones. It also has vitamins and minerals to maintain healthy joints, which for a French Bulldog that has problems with hips and joints, is a plus.  I feel better about giving the little critter a healthy treat instead of the garbage contained in brand name treats on the market.<br /><br />One huge red flag is they are made in China, which certainly gives me pause, but I will keep buying them.<br />I have only tried the beef liver variety and will stick with it since my little creature likes them so much.

review/summary: Three out of Three Dogs plus one Cat love these
review/text: I have been buying these chicken jerky treats every month via Amazon's subscription for the past six months and the bags aren't enough for the three dogs and one cat who love these treats.  All I have to do is shake one of these bags and all four come running into the kitchen.  Even the well-behaved old girl walks in hoping for her treat.<br /><br />These are the only treats I feed my dogs.  They don't get junk dog biscuits or fake sausages that smell like turpentine.  All they get are these treats, two a day per dog.  When I take them out hiking, they get extra treats for extra energy.<br /><br />The cat always insist on his own slivver, too.<br /><br />These treats are easy to pack, don't spoil easily, don't smell and are a lightweight and healthy treat for any four-legged pet. Sure, the treats are a bit pricy but my pets are worth it.<br /><br />UPDATE 24 Feb 2012:  My subscription over the past year kept going up, from a very reasonable USD 19 to a shocking USD 28.  That last price hike was just too much so I cancelled my S&S and am now buying a competitor's product that is much more affordable.  I took a star away because this product is now longer affordable.

review/summary: GREAT results with continued use at the prescribed dosage!
review/text: My 10 year-old black pug has problems with her back left hip and knee. Sometimes, the leg goes out on her and she ends up on her butt, unable to get moving again. I started feeding these Happy Hips treats to her a few months ago, but did not realize that I was not feeding as many as prescribed which is 1 jerky treat for each 7.5 pounds of body weight. She did show some relief at the lower level. However, after realizing my error and increasing the dosage to the recommended level, she now shows FANTASTIC results. After 3 weeks, she chases her squirrels, she and her cat brother play chase, and she hops right over puddles. She has not had her back leg go out on her this entire past month. She's a real dog again! Just know that you must be patient - it took 3 weeks of daily use at the recommended level to see the full results. This product has worked so well, I now have it on auto-order.

The vet told me she would probably have problems with arthritis so I give her one of these chicken strips daily and also give her liquid glucosamine choindroitin on a small piece of bread. My dog loves the chicken strips, the price on Amazon is better than me buying the indivdual packs from the store and having the glucosamine in it is another way for me to administer glucosamine to her in a way that is tasty.

review/summary: Outstanding dog treats (Not)
review/text: My dog loves them.  I purchased them way cheaper at Amazon than at the market.<br />Theoretically, they have an adequate amount of glucosamine and chondroitin.<br />My dog won't eat the pill (even in a ball of peanut butter).<br /><br />  MJG<br /><br /> Follow-up to my review of Dogswell Happy Hips. Since my original review, I have checked this product at Consumer Lab. According to their lab results this product has only 6% of the glucosamine and 14% of the condroitin that it claims. Don't buy it expecting to help your dog with joint problems<br /><br />  MJG

review/summary: This is a terrific product
review/text: This product is great.  First off, the dogs love it, they get it the same time in the morning, and they go crazy when I take out the bag.  One of my dogs has very bad allergies, he can only eat certain foods, specifically lamb and rice, and not chemical fillers. The Happy Hips fit the bill, they are quite wholesome.  My dogs are getting a bit up in years also, and it is good for them to get a dose of glucosamine and condroitin.

review/summary: Duck is very good for dogs that are prone to skin conditions
review/text: We have three dogs. One (Shaunty) is a Bishon Frise. Shaunty has had a tendency of developing "hot spots", a dermatitis type problem. Our vet recommended we switch to a duck and potato dog food, which we did. All three dogs love the  duck and potato dog food so the switch was easy...although the dog food is expensive. Anyway, when I saw these duck jerky treats I had to try them. We've been buying them monthly on Amazon's subscribe and save program and all our dogs look forward to their daily treat. You can buy this product with confidence.

review/summary: Caused diarrhea in one dog, vomiting in the other
review/text: I honestly don't know how this product could have garnered so many five-star reviews. I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats.  Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect. Internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty GI side effects with this product.

review/text: My great dane has two torn acls and has arthritis in her hips... and she is ONLY three. Well we have done one surgery and will be doing the second next spring when she is healed. In the mean time I needed to find some DIFFERENT way to provide her with Glucosamine. Since she is so picky I needed something in a treat form. These are her FAVORITE thing to eat! I went to Petco and was going to buy ONE bag for $35 and realized this offer was for THREE bags at the same price. I could not be happier and neither can she. She has only been eating them for three weeks and is not even limping on her surgical knee (its been 8 weeks and it takes 12 weeks to fully heal). Even our vet is surprised she is doing this well and the only change was these treats! I recommend them to anyone who needs to help their pet enjoy their life to the fullest! BUY these! You wont regret it!!!!<br /><br />PS - I also bought the duck and she loves those too :)

It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine. Too expensive for me. The dogs love them, so if you want to give them an expensive treat they'll love, go for it. If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere.

review/text: I hope this may help others whose dogs love this treat like my fussy Lhasa Apso but she's nearly 16 yrs. old and I found she suddenly developed an insatiable thirst; which then caused so many frequent late night forays to go outside to relieve herself we lost hours of sleep. Thinking it was her age we let it go for awhile then I decided to take her off the varied brands of dehydrated chicken breast (all without additives) and within a week she no longer empied bowls of water and had to go out all night long. It may react on her differently because of her age but for others who may experience this problem you may need to take your dog off this type of treat...I'm now using the Purina Chicken Carvers (I know chemicals) but she no longer is having problems..go figure... I guess dogs are all different too huh?

review/summary: not as good as the chicken strips
review/text: My dog is crazy for the Dogswell chicken strips but these she's not excited about. These are crunchy like a pressed cracker, not a meat strip, and not as chewy.
