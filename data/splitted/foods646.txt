review/text: Kefir grains purchased on Amazon.com.After 4 weeks I am just begining to get a consistent yield, during this time I have had everything from dirty water to soft cheese and the flavors are all over the place. It takes some trial and error, timing and temperature are critical and cause tremdous variations. However for 3days I have been yielding good consistent product and the nuts are increasing in size.

Stir about, not even close,<br />to 12 hours and bathing in another cup<br />of milk next 12 hours.  Already too thick<br />to strain thru bouquet garni bag ( just clear<br />whey came thru) and almost too thick to<br />strain thru one layer of cheesecloth.<br />Yellowish-clear layer of separation just<br />halfway down glass about 1/4" band and<br />fat kernels crusting up on top of milk when<br />time for bath.  Just let it sit on table with<br />papertowel tied over top.  Next time I shall drink some!

review/text: ive had kefir grains in the past and these were never solid.  there was not a clump that I could strain out to save for the next batch.  I tried working with it to make it work hoping they would "grow" so I could have a  grain to strain out.  this never happened.  when i wrote them about it they said i was past 90 days.  well i guess i shouldn't have spent so long trying to make it work.

I'm still giving it 3 stars because, maybe it's me doing something wrong to get funky kefir?

review/summary: OK, but do your research
review/text: I purchased these grains about a month ago.  The amount received was about a teaspoonful of very small grains.  It took a while for them to grow and they have finally reached a decent size to make a cup of Kefir.  After my purchase, I did some research about kefir. I even found people selling 2 tablespoons for $5 on Craigs List, offering the utensils to drain and store it for an extra $20.  I also found a webiste for free kefir and emailed the person living closest to me who had some to give away.  I met this kind lady from Russia and found she has been drinking kefir all her life, as has her family.  She gave me a huge grain, perhaps a 2 tablespoonful size, and I was able to make a quart of tasty, creamy kefir immediately.  The difference between the grain she gave me and the tiny grains from this seller was huge.  But I am now content with what I have and hope to share my grains.  The grains sold here are fine once they have grown but you need a lot of time and patience.

review/summary: It requires WORK people!
review/text: This is not for the weak! It requires work and I mean DAILY maintenance to grow your grains and maintain them. I can buy a few people getting "bad grains" but most are probably irritated by how much work it is. You have to keep them fed and alive and you have to care. It's ok if you give up and decide it's just not for you, but don't blame the seller for your own issues. My sister in law got me interested but her milk grains were suffering because she was using Raw milk. SHE researched (not me) that using low pasturized milk helped to grow the grains so when i bought my own (from this seller) I took her advice and used low pasturized milk only as a start. HOLY COW! I uploaded a picture of my grain and it is HUGE. That is just ONE grain mind you, I have either gifted the others, used them for making cheese or (sniff, sniff) tossed them in the disposal because I don't need that much kefir. Most of my grains I have gifted have been murdered because the folks who took them didn't like the maintenance they require. It is hard work people, but it's all about what you are willing to put yourself through for good health. It's ok if you can't handle it, life is hard enough but like I said, don't blame the seller just because you couldn't hack it! Just FYI (more sis in law research here) for a casein and lactose free diet you must let the grains sit for at least 25 - 28 hours. I screwed up and only did 24 hrs and my son is supposed to be on a casein free diet so be careful... It's a science after all. My grain is now large enough that I can use raw milk but I have noticed I still have to rock back and forth between low pasturized and raw in order to keep the grain healthy. I'm sure some folks would disagree with me but I'm just going on my own experience here and the proof is in the pudding so to speak. Have fun!

Believe it or not, I still found a way to screw things up (by using milk kefir grains to make water kefir!) and sent off an email to Seller. Actually I sent three emails, and all three were promptly answered, with all the help I could ever ask for.  As I had perhaps ruined my kefir grains (too early to tell), Seller offered to replace them!  I can't imagine anyone being unhappy with this Seller's service, and I'm betting I'll have some very good kefir before too long!

review/summary: Catit Cat Nip makes cats happy
review/text: The first time I gave my cats this cat nip, I put a little on their toys, scratching post and left to go to work, (my usual routine if I leave for more than a few hours). When I cam home,late that day, my most lazy and independent cat, Luna would not stop following me around. He cried and purred and wanted to be on my lap and in general, acted super weird. I phoned my husband in a panic - I was so sure he was ill! We retraced Luna's day together - I had forgotten about the new 'nip- My husband started laughing.."He's stoned!" What? "It's the new Catnip!" Oh. That was the only new thing and Luna was just super happy.<br />Well, I started giving waaaaay less catit nip in the morning before leaving or whenever, and now they are more normal, but even the other guy, Besos, actually climbs into the csbinet to try to find the catit 'nip if I don't give them some! They are acting younger again! they have never loved 'nip before, just kind of played with it, ate it and acted like, hey this stuff is pretty good, thanks.... Now they ask for it. Cute! Get some, but don't give too much the first time!

review/summary: I think it tastes just like Equal, but requires knowing how to use it.
review/text: This review is for the 1.7 ounce bottle.  I bought some, because I do not like the fact that over 95% of Equal is dextrose, sugar (only 1.7% is aspartame).  White sugar is a mix of dextrose and fructose.<br /><br />First off the white powder you get is sweet and tastes just like Equal to me.  For one gallon of tea I use 0.5 grams of the aspartame powder.  If you use too much you will get the bitter taste.  This is true also with Equal, if you put too many packets in it tastes bad.<br /><br />I fixed this problem long ago, I never use just Equal.  In the early days of my usage I added white sugar.  Then later I found I could drop the sugar and replace it with Sweet'N Low.  So to my tea I used 10 packets of Equal to 4 packets of Sweet'N Low.  You can drink as much as you like all day long without an after taste.  So with the aspartame powder, to my 0.5 grams of the aspartame I add the 4 packets of Sweet'N Low.<br /><br />The real problem with powdered Aspartame is it does not dissolve in water well.  It is a very fine powder and can't break the water's surface tension.  It tries to clump and even when not clumped it forms a cloudy water.  You solve this by the same method of making gravy from starch.  You put your powder in a small bowl and add water drop by drop and make a paste.  Then dissolve the paste in the water of your tea or whatever you are sweetening.<br /><br />But this is why the powdered Aspartame is packaged with dextrose in the Equal packets.  So the particles of Aspartame are separated by the dextrose particles.  Thus it dissolves.

These bones are a great alternative to rawhide, and Amazon & Co. have some of the lowest prices on them.  I have seen them sold for as high as $15.99 in some local stores.  The only downside is that they do not last very long, as they are so easy to chew through.  My dogs (Lab mix and Boxer mix) power through the medium and large sized bones in just a few minutes.  Still, all in all, worth the money!

It also has some rather odd- as French onion soups go- but flavorful additions such as carrots and tiny lentils.<br /><br />However, when made up it is easy and very good; it does not taste like it was made from a mix; it does have a lot of onion flavor- rather the point of FOS; and the added ingredient list is not excessive (to my recollection, it calls for a sauteed sweet onion in butter, 6 cups low-sodium beef broth, apple juice, and Worcestershire sauce).<br /><br />I served it with gruyere toasts: pieces of italian bread, toasted, with gruyere melted onto them, as a nod to the classic "croutons",and my family liked it very much.<br /><br />Sauteed browned mushrooms would be an excellent addition, which I will do if I make this again!

review/summary: Complex, delicious spice rub!
review/text: I'm a big spice mix fan and have to give a strong thumbs-up for Chef Tom's Bengal Masala Rub. Surprisingly, this is neither a 'burn your mouth hot' rub, nor is it even heavy on the cumin and curry flavors.  (Though why *wouldn't* you be surprised, given the exceedingly generic Product Description that Amazon lists for this mix!)<br /><br />There really isn't a single dominant note in this rub, it's a balance of cardamom, smoked paprika, garlic, and even (I suspect) cinnamon. I'd advise people who want to kick things up a notch to add a dash of cayenne or black pepper.<br /><br />This works very well on lamb, chicken, and (surprisingly!) fish such as catfish or snapper.  Tends to be lackluster on red meats and fish like tuna and salmon.<br /><br />Only the two standout mixes that Chef Tom sells: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a> are better than this one, mostly due to their extra versatility.

I love the masala, I cook with chicken breast, with ginger and cilantro, remove chicken, then add either coconut milk or 1/2n1/2 with chicken broth (also some cashews sauted in sesame oil on the side).  I agree with the other reviewer not too spicy but lots of flavor.<br /><br />For more spicy hot, I use the Tokoyo rub in my steak fajitas and use the Peri Peri on chicken cooked on the grill for spicy chicken sandwiches.

My human was thrilled to order it in Feb 2009 and have it show up on our doorstep (no hauling of heavy bag in and out of car) and it was actually slightly cheaper than if she'd bought it from our local pet megalomart chain store.  I don't like the megalomart all that much.  The floors are slippery and they make my nervous.  But then again, I do like to watch the ferrets.  Oh, little ferret, squeeze your squirmy body of of that glass case. I want to play with you soooooo badly......<br />Anyway... my human went to re-order and the price has jumped by $3 and the shipping and handling went from $6.49 to $19.01.  Her yelp of horror scared me out of sound sleep.  I was dreaming of open fields and frisky ferrets.  "Seriously?" she screeched? "The total price jumped from $41.62 to $57.50 in two months time?"  She's on a rant.  She's going back to the pet megalomart because she can haul her own bag of food for that price.  Oh, all you fine wee ferrets, get ready, I'm coming to seeeeee yooooouuuuuuu!!

review/summary: An excellent and TRUE barley grass JUICE powder
review/text: I've been using barley and wheat grass juice for about 20 years. I use to grow a lot of it myself, juice it, and drink it. In recent years I have travelled extensively and don't have the circumstances for growing and juicing barley/wheat grass. (from this point on I'll simply refer to barley grass, although all statements also apply to wheat grass).<br /><br />In recent years I have watched a multitude of cheap barley/wheat grass powders make their way onto the market. Please note that most of these products are, in my opinion, next to useless. They are made from whole dried barley/wheat grass--cellulose and all. The primary concept of having barley/wheat grass is to have the juice, free of the almost indigestible cellulose fibre of the leaf. All the early research on the many benefits of barley grass was from ingesting the pure, fresh juice. Then a process was developed (in Japan, as far as I am aware) to spray dry the juice whilst keeping most of the enzymes and nutrients intact. That processed involved using using simple sugars as a medium to help the juice turn to powder. The result is a high quality product, but one that is not pure juice powder.<br /><br />Fast forward many years, and I come across the grass juice products from Pure Planet. As you will see from my review on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011DRYF4">Just Barley - Organic Barley Juice - 80 gram - Powder</a> I give it five stars.<br /><br />Having used 5 or so jars of this product from Now Foods I have to say the product seems identical enough that I can't tell the difference. However, Now Foods gives you 118 grams for (currently) around $20 on Amazon. The Pure Planet product on Amazon is (currently) around $14 to $15. When you do the math, the Now Foods product is almost half the price.<br /><br />Obviously the many barley grass powders (not JUICE powder) as going to be a lot cheaper, but I really don't think it's worth it. Much of the nutrients in those powders are still going to be bound up in hard-to-digest cellulose, and they are far less concentrated. I've tried a few and they taste pretty poor and don't give me the lift I get from JUICE powder.

review/text: Buying direct from Amazon via a monthly subscription has ensured that this coffee arrives quickly and in the freshest condition possible. Oh, and did I mention that it is $5.00 cheaper than anywhere else?  And free shipping to boot!  Wonderful bistro flavor is now possible in my own home with this fabulous, rich, organic coffee. I am a die hard coffee snob and this is simply the best brew out there in my humble opinion!

review/summary: Cafe Altura Dark Roast was too bland for me.
review/text: My taste runs to a bold Dark Roast, with lots of flavor- i.e. Cafe Altura Dark Roast Peruvian/Sumatran.<br /><br />This is a bland/tasteless Breakfast type blend, with no distinctive flavor (2 rounded tbs per 6oz)- i.e. Folgers Classic.<br /><br />I like to switch around to different Organic beans (no burn-out), and was hoping to add this to the list?- NOT!<br /><br />Now I'm stuck using these beans up.

review/summary: Misleading product description
review/text: I'm from Greece and there's no such thing as "instant greek coffee". There seems to be a confusion among reviewers between "frappe" and "greek aka turkish coffee", we are talking about two completely different kinds of coffee. To make frappe,which is cold coffee, you can use ANY KIND of instant coffee, add cold water, milk (if you want), and ice cubes,shake and serve in a tall glass. To make traditional greek aka turkish coffee (the one served in a small cup like espresso) you need a DIFFERENT TYPE OF COFFEE (eg Loumidis papagalos greek coffee). This kind of coffee is made by adding coffee, sugar (if you want) and water in a tiny boiling pan (called ibrik) and slowly bring it to a boil until the coffee rises. Nescafe classico is a very nice coffee, but it's totally different than the traditional greek/turkish coffee.It can only be used for cold frappe or hot instant, NOT traditional greek coffee.

review/summary: Good stuff, needs experimentation
review/text: I've been looking for a decent instant coffee, and since I like Greek coffee, decided to give this a try.  Long story short, it's not bad stuff -- but since I don't read Greek, it's taken a lot of experimentation with amounts to get the amounts right.  I find that if I don't use enough of the instant granules, I get a thin acidic cup, so I personally use about two tablespoons per cup of hot water.<br /><br />Remember that this is intended to taste like strong Greek coffee, not drip-brew, and is best taken with sugar, no cream.  I normally take my coffee black, but this doesn't taste quite right to me without a little sugar.

Better than chips and candy bars to ward off their munchies and cravings, we subscribe to a frequent delivery of a case of these from Amazon to get an even better price, and keep our closet stocked with bars like this instead of junk foods.  Our kids grab these in the morning on the way too school, keep them tucked in their backbacks for quick nibble-fixes during the day, and if their friends come over after school or if they have team events to go to and have a quick hunger attack.  These are handy and filling, and a great Amazon Prime value.

review/text: These Nutri-Grain Kellogg's Cereal Bars aren't as horrible as you'd expect.  In fact they actually taste pretty good.  No, nothing will ever be able to replicate an actual bowl of cereal on a hungry Monday morning, but when you're late for work and having trouble getting the kids out the door and to the bus stop in time, you can count on a nice healthy cereal bar as a worthwhile alternative.  These are significantly more delicious than pop tarts too.  I never understood the appeal of pop tarts- whether in a toaster or eating cold, they still taste horrendous.  Cereal bars -especially these ones- are much better.  Your tastebuds will thank you... and thank me for the recommendation, haha.

review/summary: Too Much and Too Sweet
review/text: I would not recommend buying this product because of its large quantities and extremely sweet flavor. Caution: They may not be as healthy as they seem.<br /><br />When I first got these cereal bars I honestly thought they were delicious and great. I ate a couple every few days. It's true that this product would make a great snack or quick breakfast... but only for a short period of time. I soon got tired of these cereal bars and half of the box still exists (it was only me eating them).<br /><br />They are very very sweet and there's more of the sweet jam filling than the multigrain wrap. If you do not have much of a sweet tooth (like me) I do not recommend getting these. And if you really want them, buy the individual boxes in stores. They may be a bit more pricey if you count the individual cost, but you get more choices of flavors and there's only 8 bars per box so you wont end up with a ton left over when you finally get sick of them. And plus, leftover food is still money wasted.<br />Amazon has them but they only sell the boxes in 6 count packs like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYFCHW">Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Cherry, 8-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a> or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E77LT6">Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Strawberry, 8-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a> so you still get 48 bars.<br /><br />So I give this product 3 stars. It's okay, but not great. And they are 120 calories per bar.

review/summary: Use Zoe for baking
review/text: Zoe is made from big fat olives that are meaty and buttery tasting. When my husband and I went to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company in Pittsburgh, PA, the olive oil buyer guided us through our first olive oil purchase. She had us eat the olives that went into different kinds of olive oil and then pick the olives we liked best. Our first purchase of Zoe was the result. It is an olive oil with a distinctly buttery taste. I use it in baking cakes whenever oil or melted butter is called for. It tastes great! Absolutely great! Plus, it's heart healthy, which butter is not. Sigh. Other olives, particularly Italian olives that are made into olive oil are very peppery. Hence, their oil is peppery. This might be what other people are talking about when they say they don't like Zoe. Zoe is not a bit peppery. So please, you must try for yourself in this case. It is not a good idea to take anyone else's product review for olive oil to heart. (a pun!) You must decide what you like in an olive oil and buy according. Also, I want to mention that the buttery taste stays there even through a saute. We bought different types of Italian olive oil in smaller bottles that same first time at the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company, and then we came home and made fried eggs with all of them. In that venue the taste of the olive oils really came through and Zoe kept that buttery taste. Good eating!

Perfect for salad dressings, sauteing, baking, etc. There's nothing I wont use this oil in. Another plus is the size, no more trying to find a cabinet space tall enough for a tall bottle of oil. I've finally found an affordable winner!

review/text: The EVOO is as tasty as described in other reviews. I thought I'd comment on the container. It is hard to open at best. The green pouring spout is accessed by pulling a ring pull which is very hard to pry up. Then it takes considerable pulling to expand the pour spout. The cap then unscrews however it is very hard to pour without a large amount of residue accumulating on the top of the container.<br />I recommend the oil but also recomment decanting it into another container or pouring bottle.

review/summary: Tried it in many uses, but didn't like it
review/text: I bought this olive oil since it was organic, and went through 6 (750 mL) cans on a subscription, but in the end I decided to stop buying it. I bought this oil to be my basic mid-priced olive oil primarily for sauteing. I like all sorts of olive oil -- from soft and buttery to peppery and green. This oil has a heavy woody scent, not as fragrant as other good EVOO in this price range. Sampled uncooked, the oil has mild initial taste, not much olive flavor at all, but not unpleasant, but what I didn't like is its harsh after-taste. It was not good in salad dressings. With other flavorings, the harshness is muted but still remains. In cooked dishes any olive oil flavor mostly disappears. In the same price range, I've had better luck with obscure Spanish or Greek 1 L cans of EVOO from the supermarket.

review/summary: Almost perfect organic olive oil
review/text: The price and quality of this product are both fantastic. I love that the dark, tin container greatly protects the taste and integrity of the oil (versus the typical glass bottle). However, there is an inherent problem with the pouring spout. It is plastic and very short. This leads to oil dripping on the top during usage, which is both wasteful and messy. If the manufacturer would alter that one component, this would be the perfect organic olive oil.
