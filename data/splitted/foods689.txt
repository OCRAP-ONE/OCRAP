review/text: Love fig newtons!  These are really fresh individually sealed, unlike their 1lb counterpart packages that have a tendency to get stale rather quickly.  These are worth the extra cost for that reason alone.  But, they're grab and go snacks too that are somewhat healthy for you than a regular cookie.  They also make great treats for after ballgames and other sports.  We love these in our house, highly recommend!

review/text: I like Fig Newtons and have been missing them since I cut out white flour and enriched flour from my diet. These are made with whole grain and taste very good. The reason I can't give them five stars is because even though the advertisement does not list "high fructose corn syrup" as an ingredient, the actual nutrition label does. This is an ingredient that I try not to have in my food, but it is getting very difficult to find products that don't contain it.

review/text: I have to stay for long hours at school, and I've been looking for snacks I can bring that aren't too unhealthy. When I found out about these fig newton minis, I was pretty excited since I absolutely love the full size fig newtons. Since they're smaller, there is of course much less of the fruit filling.. but still, a delicious snack. The size of each individual bag is quite small (a little over 1oz) so it's not too great at staving off those hunger pangs, but it helps.

review/text: If this is the first time you've considered tasting a Fig Newton then, Welcome to; America, planet Earth, or back from the dead. Nabisco has been baking these little gems for over 100 years and they are a part of American culture. If you actually haven't tried a "Newton" they are small cookies that consist of a soft cake outer sleeve with sweet fig jam in the middle. These packages are half the size of a regular package of newtons and come in a rigid plastic tray, inside a plastic bag, inside a small cardboard box. These were fresh and well within the "best by" date.

review/summary: Dogs love it
review/text: Science Diet dog food is pretty pricey, but the overall effects of this product is great. I had been feeding my dog Iams Lamb and Rice for years (also a decent dog food) and after my local grocery store stopped carrying it, I decided to try Science Diet to see why my vet recommened it so highly. My dogs love the stuff. A big bowl of Iams would last a couple of days or sometimes three with my animals returning to the bowl to chow down here and there throughout the day, the same sized serving of Science Diet is scarfed down in one sitting with my dogs liking the bowl clean.<br /><br />It has produced better 'dog biscuits' from them as well. Not that they had terrible stool from the Iams, but it is noticeably firmer and they don't use the bathroom nearly as much which lets me know they are digesting more of the material and excreting less waste. After a few weeks of them being on Science Diet I have also noticed their coats getting a healthier shine to them as well.<br /><br />It is pricey stuff, but if my results are typical, I recommend the purchase.

review/text: This is a really lousy quality food made primarily of corn and byproducts. Corn is a cheap filler which offers little nutritional value and byproducts, well self explanatory (leftovers when all the nutritious bits have been taken out for human consumption). Dont let your vet talk you into feeding this to your dogs. Vets do not receive any nutritional training besides what is offered to them by sales reps from Hills! Whats ironic is that this "food" is no better then any low end grocery store brand, yet you're expected to shell out as much as better quality brands.

review/text: We have a picky eater who has allergies.  A friend of our clued us in to the fact that dogs with allergies could have problems with grain in dog food.  Researched a little on the internet and turns out there's a lot of merit to that.  We selected Rachel Ray's because it had more meat than most (we just walked Wal-Mart and compared labels till we narrowed it down to two).  Our dog goes hungry before eating food she doesn't like and she gobbles this stuff up.  After 9 months we have noticed her allergies are completely cleared up as well.  Eye buggars and profuse feet licking (the vet said she's allergic to grass - really!)  So after 6 years, apparently we don't need the eye drops and the foot spray.  Just needed to change up her dog food.  Vet didn't mention that either... amazingly the guy who sells us the medicines - go figure!

On the plus side however, her "Just 6" treats is one of BEST products out there, so I know she has the knowledge to make heathy foods for pets, just not willing to part with her money in her dog food line.

review/text: This is the only olive oil we use now.  It is a wonderfully flavored oil and is great for cooking but really perfect for using as dips or dressings.  I actually don't buy it via amazon because you can get it for $20 less and $0 shipping at vitacost, but it's worth every cent, no matter where you purchase it.

This bar is a good source fiber and Omega 3, made with many low-GI ingredients, non-GMO, dairy and casein free, low sodium with no transfats or cholesterol and certified gluten free and Kosher Parve. Only 190 calories. I win. Celiacs win. : ) (Also, usually the really natural bars (especially ones with nuts) cause break-outs on my face. I was just waiting for it to happen with this one and it DIDN'T. Double win!!!)

I started buying true bars last November 2011 from  Bakery on Main as a way to find better gluten free products if you know anything about being gluten free you will understand its very difficult to eat foods without being absolute sure they are gluten free. From a dedicated source Truebars are not only the very BEST ever tasting they are melt in your mouth best tasting, this is my favorite coconut cashew, so good I found it hard to not eat the entire sleeve of them, 1000% recommended by me.<br /><br />Celiac since birth.

review/summary: Haribo Gummi Bears BURSTING with FLAVOR!
review/text: First of all I would like to say that HANDS DOWN, Haribo makes the best Gummi Candies. It's true. If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears are just Bursting with Flavor! They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)! I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in about six different flavors and each one is yummy! You also get a good mix of colors and flavors. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a "chocolate-type candy" where you'd have to worry about allergies.<br /><br />They arrived at my home fresh and delicious. Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some.  But, I do recommend the five pound bag over the pack of twelve.  You get approximately a pound and a half more in the five pound bag for about .50 more!<br /><br />Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound! And these are the same exact bears, but you don't have to worry if everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag! That's a big plus for me!<br /><br />I definitely recommend these gummi bears, they are a sweet and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal! I will definitely be ordering more and different kinds. We all have our favorites!

review/summary: Haribo Versions
review/text: German Haribos don't contain artificial flavors and no artificial colors. German Haribos are all natural.<br />The Turkish ones however taste too sweet and less fruity, and look much more colorful because of artificial colors (FD & C yellow no. 5, red no. 40,blue no.1) and unnatural flavors.<br /><br />When you send a mail to Haribo, they reply that the Turkish Haribos, sold in the US, contain that artificial stuff, so that the Gummy Bear flavor survives the long shipping by ship. Looking at long shelf life duration of even the German Haribos that seems like a lie to me. Cost cutting and less restrictive US-Food regulation seem to be the real reasons ...<br /><br />Hungarian made Haribos (seen in India) aren't any better btw.

review/summary: Haribo Original Gold-Bears - Great Candy Snack with Less Guilt!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVT042">Haribo's Original Gold-Bears (Pack of 12)</a> is a great way to buy sweets that aren't always easy to find in the US. I wasn't always a Haribo gummi fan, but I have my ex girlfriend to thank for getting me hooked.  These come in sugar free versions as well, but I prefer the regular ones.<br /><br />I really love this 12 pack more than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVOSE4">Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears, 5-Pound Bags</a> that are also sold on Amazon.  The main reason is that the 5 lb bag is only ideal for a party with A LOT of kids eating them.  I know that the 5 lb bag gives you more candy for your money.  But these 5 OZ bags keep the gummis fresh and help with portion control.<br /><br />I always share when I eat these or save the excess.  For me a 5-oz bag is too much to eat alone.  1 5-Oz bag is good enough for 3 or 4 people to share.<br /><br />Haribo gummis are very chewy compared to others, but they also contain less sugar and more fruity flavor.  I personally think they are the best.  They have 5 flavors inside including pineapple, lemon, orange raspberry and strawberry.<br /><br />Definitely don't hesitate to get this.  I haven't tried all of the weird flavors (cola, etc) but I have had many and they are almost all great.  But these original bears are going to please most people.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Best Gummi Bears ever
review/text: I am somewhat of a gummi connoisseur of the gummi candy.  I consider the gummi it's own food group.  (If not, what group does it belong in?)  Anyway, after searching and sampling bear after bear across the globe, the Haribo are the best ever.  The flavor and more importantly the consistency of the gummi is perfect.  They are not too soft, so some of the cheap store brands and they are not too hard or solid to where you can't chew them easily.  I ate these overseas years ago and every time I traveled to Europe, I would bring home a stash.  I found that Amazon now carries them, so I am in heaven.  When I bring bags to work to share, they disappear faster than any other candy.  Really a treat.  People laugh when I tell them Haribo is the best gummi bear ever, but once they try them, they all agree with me.

If you're going to ship all the way from over there, why not give the American consumer something worthwhile...?

review/summary: the ideal gummy bear
review/text: i've had my share of gummy bears in my life (they're my favorite candy,) and these take the cake.  where to begin?<br /><br />the fruit flavors are perfect and well balanced.  no matter what flavor distribution i throw back, from one at a time to a whole handful, it always tastes great.  great flavor balance.<br /><br />consistency-wise they are on the firm side (which is a very good thing, nothin' worse than a soft/squishy gummy).  the beeswax coating is the best way to keep them from sticking together as well, no powdery or filmy residue after you eat them.  just your plain ol' mouth ready to eat more gold bears.<br /><br />they have always been pretty fresh to me, as well. sometimes the 5 lb. HUGE bag can get a bit stale, but this only happens with the last few handfuls and even the stale ones are better than most other gummies.<br /><br />finally, they have what i call a long betrayal period, meaning you can eat a large quantity of them before feeling sick of them.  this could be seen as a vice for their obvious dental and dietary drawbacks, but i'm giving points for their lasting quality.<br /><br />I like getting the 5 lb. bag over this box of 12 bags because it's cheaper by volume and i like the lack of excess plastic packaging involved.  plus as i stated before they don't go stale very quickly.<br /><br />very VERY good.

I feel it would be easier to carry with you to the movies, or work with smaller packages. The amount of money you save buying in bulk on amazon as opposed to stores in great and was enought o convince me. No other gummi bear compares in flavor and quality. Every other one seems to scratch my throat or taste too acidic and like cough medicine. Haribo on the other hand is gummy gummi bear goodness and like one other review said they are very versatile as they can be eaten by themselves, on top of ice cream, frozen in home-made ice cream, made in cakes, or part of decorative gingerbread houses you can do many things with this simple, great-tasting candy.

review/text: I used to buy these for my daughters when I was stationed overseas and would go on temporary duty assignments to Germany.  Everytime I came home they always knew they would have more gummi bears.  They have been doing nothing but remembering the gummi bears this year so as a christmas treat I decided to buy them some and if it's a big hit, it may be a new christmas tradition for not only them but my grandson too.

review/summary: It's not your average bear
review/text: The creme de la creme of gummi bears.  You can't find this product in any grocery stores. (*update: I found these at Long's but for a 5 oz bag they were taxing it at 1.40 a bag.) That alone says enough for me.  It's one of those things that you can only find in exclusive places ie CostPlus, Amazon, etc.<br /><br />Their product is created more of starch, not of gelatin like other brands.  This results more of a cleaner bite rather than a chewy one.  I also found that in other brands, the gummi bears tend to be oily where as Haribo coat theirs with beeswax.  The process of Haribos gummi bears take days to complete; the quality is detected once you bite it.<br /><br />Very enjoyable, fresh (especially when you have 12/5oz bags to enjoy).

review/summary: bad for heatlh - corn syrup - no original haribo
review/text: I'm totally disapointed by HARIBO and by the american product - produced in Turkey. They called it original and its not, because they use the corn syrup in the Haribo for the Americans. I'm German living in the US and ordered it for my 2 year old daughter. But I'm totally disapointed. They dont use fructose or syrup made out of fruits. The corn syrup goes into the lever of our kids and turns into fet. Its a grazy thing what Haribo does and I throw all the Gummib&auml;rchen into the trash. Its not ORIGINAL Its against kids and its not a sweet in somehow a good way - its a sweet in a very bad american way where people are used for the experiements of food industry and there profit.

review/summary: The best gummi bears out there!
review/text: From my experience as a gummi bear lover and amateur connoisseur, I have found that Haribo consistently makes the best gummi bears. However, if you purchase a big bag and fail to eat them quickly, they will get hard. That's why this 12-pack of 5-oz bags is perfect for those who want to satiate their gummi bear cravings without overindulging. Subscribe and Save also allows you to replenish your gummi bear stock periodically at a lower price than most grocery stores or discount stores (e.g. Walmart or Target).

Since I had not seen this brand in  the US, I searched online and came across this product on Amazon.

review/summary: 12 Pack Order Helps to Limit My Intake
review/text: This is the first time that I have purchased Haribo Gummi bears and they are chewier and the taste is more subtle than other gummi bears with which I was familiar.  However, they quickly become addictive and that is why a 5 lb bag would spell disaster for me because I would be unable to stop eating them.  I like the fact that the gummi bears are chewier because it slows me down.  Initially I ate several gummi bears at one time and it was hard to distinguish the different flavors.  I currently find the taste to be more distinctive if I eat the same flavor at one time.<br /><br />I will buy Haibo gummy bears again because I like the consistency and taste which I think is more subtle than others that I have tried.
