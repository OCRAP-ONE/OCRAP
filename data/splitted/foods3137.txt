review/text: Ever since I started and finished my hcg diet I've been hooked on this stuff. Yes it is FARR more expensive then buying regular sugar, but this is natural/healthy, ZERO calories, and it tastes pretty damn good. I wish amazon sold the spoonable tub but hey I'm saving like $20 bucks on here. I usually have to pay $7.99 plus tax per 80 count packet box, so amazon for now on!!

review/summary: Not the real deal.
review/text: I was delighted when I found another sweetener that seemed to be based on stevia and not aspartame or chlorine (clorinated sugar, that is, as in Splenda). But after I used up my first box, which was not the most enjoyable experience (had a bad aftertaste), I decided to boycott the stuff.<br /><br />The mix of erythritol and rebiana goes through a patented process that is controlled by the same big companies that manage aspartame. Some of it starts out with stevia but the same could be said of Splenda and sugar; the whole ends up being truly artificial in substance. Just say 'no'. Look for a stevia sweetener that consists of stevia, not some big company's invention.<br /><br />The stuff I'm using now is absolutely wonderful. It's called SweetLeaf.

review/summary: Good product, great value
review/text: I really like Truvia.  Mostly I use it to sweeten tea (hot and iced), but I am sure that it would be good for other things as well.  I find its taste to be pleasantly sweet, and I prefer this to other artificial sweeteners such as Sweet'N'Low or Splenda that sometimes have a slightly "funny" taste to me.  This is a great deal for the amount of packets that you get- the price per packet is much better than buying in any stores where I am, plus at most I could only get 80 packets in one package at the store.  It's nice to get this large box full of packets if you use it frequently.

review/summary: One of the best sugar substitutes I've found
review/text: I think I've tried every sugar substitute that exists, at one time or another. I pair Truvia with Stevia powder for my coffee but use it alone in oatmeal or cereal. I've never noticed an after taste and I don't become desensitized like I did when I used Equal. I was requiring more and more Equal to get the same sweetness level. I don't know how "healthy" Truvia is or isn't because you can find research and articles to support either side. I've been buying it in large boxes for a while now on Amazon and am quite pleased that this lasts me for quite a while.

review/summary: Good price
review/text: I had tried several stevia products in the past and always threw them out because they were awful. This one is pretty good.  I admit, it's not the best-tasting sweetener, but I suppose it's the healthiest alternative (so far as we know anyways), thus it's the one I use. I use to use Equal many years ago, but it gave me a headache and I found out it was a neurotoxin. Then I started using Splenda, which is the best in my opinion as far as taste goes. But now you hear about it not being that great either (healthwise), being chlorinated and all, so I stopped using it. Then I tried Truvia. Like I said, it's not the best - it does leave a bit of an aftertaste with tea, and using it for whipped cream did not work at all, I ended up having to add a bunch of powdered sugar to the cream to make it edible. I primarily use it to sweeten my greek yogurt with berries, as I still need a touch of sweetness, so one packet is great, tastes good. I also use it for my other low carb dessert - 2-3 oz cream cheese with a few berries and one packet of Truvia, also good.

review/summary: Great for natural low impact sugar whether for diabetes or diet
review/text: I used to be a sugaraholoc who is now, surprise!, borderline diabetic; therefore, I have gotten to know a few of the newer low impact table sugar substitutes. While Splenda is sweet and is cheap, it is not very natural with the chlorine added etc. I won't hesitate to use while out at a restaurant if they have it, but for home use I wanted something  more natural for the long term health benefits. Sweet and Low is very sweet, but who needs the whole chemical trip, right? Agave is natural, but high impact (low compared to table sugar, but still nowhere near these sugar substitutes).<br /><br />Truvia finds the perfect balance. It seems to be the safest for the long term while keeping the impact almost trivial. It has a very nice flavor, I can eat it right out of the pouch, or on top of stawberries and other fruits. It sweetens my daily tea and coffee with no alteration to the tea or coffee flavor--that's vital,--and it comes in these packets that make using the sweetner easy to moderate and measure.<br /><br />Give yourself a little time to get used to Truvia, and remind yourself of the benefits of it compared to the others, and I think you may find it to be the best of all of the low impact table sugar substitutes, of which you won't have to feel guilty eating and enjoying.

review/summary: Great tasting natural sweetener
review/text: Stevia is a natural sweetener from plant roots. This Truvia is a great tasting sweetener, with big granules. It is nice to know it is not made from petroleum products or chlorinated sugar, etc.<br /><br />Truvia tastes good in coffee and tea, and well, I tried mixing it with unflavored yogurt and it helped too. It has a slightly different taste vs. sugar, but you can always just use both in the coffee to save $$. The Truvia packets of 80 are about $4 to $5 at the store, so this 400-ct. box is comparably priced. I have no time for those who sell it for double the cost and then add exorbitant shipping.<br /><br />So thank you Amazon for this item, it is great tasting, natural, and a great price.

review/summary: Bitter, nasty aftertaste
review/text: I saw the large amount of good reviews but, unfortunately, my experience was different.  Everyone's taste buds are unique, so my opinion may not be the norm.<br /><br />I put it in my coffee and it was sweet but the coffee became undrinkable.  I actually had to pour it down the drain.  It also left a very bitter taste in my mouth.<br /><br />I went back to the store and bought Splenda (which I didn't want to, due to the artificial ingredients) but then my coffee, and then a cup of tea later, were fine.  Since I'm diabetic, I had to find something that would work, since I can't drink coffee that hasn't been sweetened.  I will be giving the Truvia away but if I can't find any takers, it will, unfortunately, go in the trash.<br /><br />I hope your experiences are better than mine.

I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.<br /><br />I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.<br /><br />As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia!

review/text: For years, I had been taking Aspartame (NutraSweet) and Sucralose (Splenda) with my coffee, until I read how unhealthy and potentially dangerous they are. All the details and general concern are delineated in a great book titled 'Sweet Deception' by Dr. Joseph Mercola (highly recommended read, by the way). I was hoping for the longest time that a non-toxic, safe and natural alternative to artificial sweeteners would hit the marketplace en masse. Enter Stevia, and Truvia. I add Truvia (half a packet) to each cup of coffee, and it tastes just like sugar! I detect no bitterness or other off tastes at all. And I feel very good about knowing that this is a much healthier and safer natural alternative to dangerous artificial sweetners, and that it has been consumed for centuries in Asia, South America, and other areas worldwide.

review/text: This product came up on a search for stevia, but it does not contain any stevia, just chemicals I wanted to avoid. The name seems deliberately deceptive, sounding some what Like stevia.Also,the product description is all about stevia. The taste doesn't matter, it's not what I wanted.

review/summary: terrible after taste
review/text: I bought this product based on the reviews I saw on this site, but was completely dissatisfied. I have been using XyloSweet for years and thought this might be a good substitute. It left such a bad aftertaste and was way too sweet. If you are looking for a good sugar substitute with no aftertaste.. buy XyloSweet.

review/summary: Great taste w/o the cancer!
review/text: I just started using Truvia in conjunction with my HCG Diet, and surprisingly it tastes great! Truvia sweetens up my coffee and tea just right, without the weird aftertaste that other stevia type sweeteners tend to have. The only downside to Truvia is that it has 3 carbs per packet, and no fiber to justify the carbs. Such a tiny packet, with no calories, but so many carbs when you're on a low-carb, restricted diet. If it didn't have any carbs (or even just one carb), I would've given it five stars, but until then... Still, it tastes great, has no calories, and doesn't cause cancer, which makes it pretty darn near perfect!

review/summary: Must be genetic
review/text: After comparing my own sense of what sweeteners taste best with that of others, I have concluded that there must be a genetic explanation for why some brands have an unpleasant aftertaste for certain people while being perfectly flavorless for others. I have a strong aversion to Sweet n Low because of what is for me a most unpleasant aftertaste, but I know that some people enjoy it.  Splenda and Equal have very little aftertaste for me, and blended in with other ingredients, I cannot detect any unpleasant taste from either, although I have friends who cannot stand to use them. Many years ago, I bought liquid Stevia sweetener, but the aftertaste, which to me had an anise flavor, was a turn-off. In the quest for a healthier sweetener, I decided to purchase a small box of Truvia, thinking that the powdered form might be more inviting.  Instead, it has the same disgusting bitter aftertaste that I remember from Sweet n Low. But like that sweetener, many people seem to enjoy Truvia and other Stevia products. If you aren't able to try just a sample of Truvia and therefore are considering spending your hard-earned cash on an entire box, then be aware before you buy that you may have taste buds like mine that can detect bitterness in this product.

review/summary: It tastes awful
review/text: I avoid sugar like it's the plague. At first, I used Splenda, and it was to me the best tasting sugar substitude in the market. Then I read a couple of articles about it's side effects, then I switched to Equal... again I read about it's side effects, that are as scary as killing braincells and might be linked to cause alzheimer's. I already have a bad enough memory, which has gotten worse (and I'm only 36!!) so I obviously got spooked. Then I read that Stevis is the best 'natural' no calorie sweetner out there (I wonder how long it will take for some article to come out and tell you how bad it is for you?) Anyhow, I bought PureVia, and it had an awful after taste, it was truly as if this was some chemicaly fabricated substitute rather than 'natural' I though: " OK, maybe is the brand."<br /> Then I bought, Truvia, same thing, that after taste again. Finally I bought Sun Cryslals -- which is not quite sugar free, each packet has 2g of sugar-- I figure, "they know how bad this thing tastes that is why they are mixing it with actual sugar." It's just as bad.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say, but I rather have the Splenda and Equal anyday rather than this product. I tried to be positive about it and give it a little while to get used to, but I just can't, and I can't help but to think that somewhere along the line some study is going to claim that it will make you bald, so I rather not sacrifice. I'm still looking for an alternative to the 'big 3' sweetners, but for now, I'm having my coffee black.

review/summary: Horrid tasting stuff
review/text: I find this to be the most offensive-tasting substitute for sugar. It does not resemble 'sweet'. It's a strange taste that made me recoil when tasting it; and, I had to spit it out. Then it left a bad taste in my mouth. The price is expensive compared to other sweeteners. I will NEVER purchase this again. And will continue to use saccharin (Sweet & Low) as it comes the closest to resembling a sugar taste.

review/text: It doesn't taste bad but i had to measure out the same amount of this as i used to measure out sugar in my coffee. I'm trying to cut down on sugar and i put a lot of sugar in my coffee. 3 heaping tablespoons to be exact and that's if i'm trying to use less sugar. So i basically have to put that much truvia in my coffee. It tastes good but i'll stick with my Ideal. It is very sweet, tastes better then truvia, and It's also cheap. Also i'm not scared of chemicals tested on lab rats that caused problems in extremely high doses. I've eaten McDonalds for Christ sake!!! If i didn't die from that i doubt sucrolose is gonna kill me! =)

review/summary: Fresh Nutty & Fruity On the Go Snack
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised that this bar actually tasted like a handful of fresh nuts & fruit. Usually snack, protein or energy bars taste chemically. Not this one. It would be a convenient food to take to eat on-the-go. But, be warned. It's a bit on the sticky side (and I didn't carry it in the sun or in a car...). So either bring along a moist towelette or use a squirt of those towel free hand sanitizers to eliminate sticky finger syndrome. I'd suggest not eating this particular bar while driving because of that. The calories were not too high for this class of food product (190) and the sodium wasn't obnoxious (20mg - I've seen worse), but I wish they'd get the sugars to under 9g (they're 12g). While I wouldn't eat these bars every day, for nutritional & calorie reasons, it's a brand I'll keep on hand for quick emergency hunger fixes.

You can buy them at kroger but they are much cheaper at amazon (almost half the price if you get a subscription).<br />I also had the dark chocolate cherry bar but I didn't buy it from amazon. It's really sweet and not to my liking. It's a good replacement if you normally eat a candy bar but that's just my opinion.<br />Go order some you won't regret it.

review/text: I've never had anything gluten-free before and these bars are awesome! Note: you really have to like cranberries because it can overpower the almond taste.

review/text: Cranberry almond KIND bars are my favorite flavor.  The bonus is that they have a low glycemic index.  I give these as tips & gifts.  People are so appreciative because these bars are so healthy.  I keep a couple in my purse at all times - for me & to share.

review/text: Kind Plus, Peanut Butter, Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars are really good!  They're so good I've doubled my monthly order.  They're better than Snickers, and certainly better for you.  I've been diagnosed with celiac disease for 18 years, and these bars are a favorite snack.

review/summary: healthy treat
review/text: This bar is the perfect snack for late afternoon or whenever you feel lethargic or hungry, especially when you know you are eating something good for your body. I guess they are a bit expensive, but for a product that has added antioxidants, and is gluten free, i guess that's about right. At least Amazon offers a great discount.

review/summary: Should be called "Peanut bar with Almonds and Other Nuts"
review/text: While this bar (Almond Walnut Macadamia with Peanuts) is really tasty, I was surprised by the misleading description because Peanuts are actually the first ingredient (you have to lift the marketing flap on the packaging to discern the actual ingredients), yet they say "Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein with Peanuts". Their description would tend to let you think peanuts are way down on the list. Shame on you - how Kind is that? Just rename it for what it is.

review/summary: Kind Bars
review/text: Kind bars are awesome.  I'm a hiker, figure skater and I also travel quite a bit with my job.  I prefer KIND bars for hiking because they are GOOD.  So often hiking food in general is loaded with salt just to give it taste and then it's still not very good.  I actually crave Kind bars.  They are good energy for skating and excellent to throw in before a meeting or take on the airplane in case I'm delayed.  Just good stuff and gluten free.

review/text: I didn't buy this product off Amazon (sorry, guys!) but I normally buy it at school for a quick and mostly healthy snack in between classes. I'm surprised at all the negative reviews. I am a very picky eater and I really like these bars. They  satisfy my craving for something sweet while still being healthy. I also love the fact that one bar really fills me up, as it normally takes 2 fruit or granola bars to do the same.

review/summary: Love these bars!
review/text: I discovered these bars some time ago at my local grocery store - they were on this little display with some other things. The next time I went there, I couldn't find them. And I couldn't really remember what they were called. So, I was very excited when I saw them at Starbucks probably a year later. They are, of course, way too expensive there! I wasn't able to find them reliably anywhere around town, so I found them online and now I have two boxes (two different flavors) auto-shipped to me from Amazon. Now I have begun to see these in stores more often so I've been trying some other flavors.<br /><br />I used to eat Kashi cereal each morning but now I have one of these bars with my requisite Dr. Pepper. I'm not sure how long ago I changed my breakfast choice, but I have lost about 15 pounds (that needed to be lost) since I changed over to the bars. I definitely didn't change earlier than November, 2010. And, instead of being starving at 11 a.m., I don't get seriously hungry until later.*<br /><br />* These claims have not been evaluated by anyone, and no animals have been tortured to prove them.

review/summary: Too sticky, messy
review/text: The bar is a sticky mess inside a wrapper that can't be pulled away from the "bar".  The flavor is good, but much of the contents remain stuck to the wrapper.  If you do manage to pull the wrapping away, the contents sag and fall apart.  I have had other Kind bars and liked them, but will not buy this variety again.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: Nuts. 500mg of Omega-3. The package has all the appeal of an average healthy snack bar. It also touts Non GMO ingredients, and they donate 5% of their profits to PeaceWorks Foundation. Bonus. So, I picked up a few on close-out at my local grocer.<br /><br />Made in Australia, stored on a shelf, put on close-out, and traveled around in my bag for awhile... not even close to expiration, but still... it has been around.  I expected a mediocre nut bar. Not so. It's so good I felt compelled to look online for more.<br /><br />Looking over the ingredients list, nothing stands out as "The Flavor" that makes these so tasty, so I'll just leave it at that. Simple, sweet and soft, crunchy and flavorful. I wish I would have bought the rest of the ones I saw on close-out. These are good.

review/summary: items were not as fresh as they are in the local grocery
review/text: ... I was excited to find these on Amazon, but i was a bit disappointed.  Unlike the bars I have purchased locally, the bar cannot be extracted from the wrapper intact; they stick to the wrapper as if they had not been kept in a cool dry place.  Except for the annoyance of peeling them off by pieces from the wrapper, they are still quite tasty.

review/summary: Not my kind of flavor
review/text: I've only eaten the KIND bar once, and it was definitely not this flavor but I didn't realize it until I opened it up and tasted it.  I love mango. I love macadamia. But in this bar, together, they are not great.  It's not bad... just not my cup of tea. The mango is a little too artificial and I don't get the macadamia crunch so I would say try another flavor.

review/text: This is not the first time I've purchased KIND bars although it is the first time I have ordered this particular flavor combination.  I just love them.  These bars have a wonderfully nutty flavor and are delightfully delicious to me.  Reminds me of a blend of a nutty granola bar and sweet peanut brittle, only better and much healthier for me.  I will definitely be ordering these again.

review/summary: delicious
review/text: I am gluten-free and dairy-free, so there are not a lot of "on the go" food choices.  Some, like the Lara bars, are really dense and don't resemble real food.  The Kind bars however taste fresh with a nice mix of flavors.  The Cranberry Almond is my favorite, followed closely by the Almond Apricot.  They are resilient enough to be carried around in my purse for "food emergencies".  They get a little flat, but hold up much better than a banana and still taste great.  Good price on Amazon, I pay over $20/box at local stores.

review/summary: Healthy Candy Bar!
review/text: Of all the KIND bars (and I've had them all) this one will hit the spot if you're craving the taste and texture of caramel and nuts. What's nice is that the fat content is relatively low for something that really can qualify as a comfort snack, while the nuts and other unprocessed goodies will give you sustained energy and the important OMGA-3.<br /><br />I've removed all the junk snacks from our home and put in boxes of KIND Bars; this one is the one I have to restock most often. If you're curious, go to your local health food store and pay $2.00 for a single bar; I promise you'll be back here ordering it by the box.

review/summary: Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants
review/text: First got turned onto these bars at Starbucks. Our favorite is the blueberry vanilla & cashew but Amazon does not offer this combo for some reason. So I ordered the  Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants as well as another type, figuring that even if the kids did not like it my husband would take the remainders to work to snack on midday. Well no one likes this flavor. It consists of a lot of the puffed filler grains used in cheap bars, almost like smaller firmer rice crispies. I even had the box in the car to pull out when the kids were starving as a snack but no go and husband doesn't like them. The other kind I ordered was the fruit and nut delight which everyone will eat, but our favorite remains the blueberry vanilla and cashews.
