review/text: My baby boy loves eating this food, better than some Earth's best Stage 3 foods.  It doesn't taste too bad either.  I love the sweet potatoes in the food.  The pouch is great for on the go, not having to worry about glass food containers breaking in the diaper bag, especially when we go for hikes.

review/summary: Doesn't taste good.
review/text: I make my own baby food but when we travel I give my daughter plum organics and happy baby food. She likes them a lot so i wanted to try something with meat. This product has good reviews so I ordered it thinking you can't go wrong with sweet potatoes and chicken. But i was wrong it taste bad.My daughter won't eat it even when she is starving. She actually didn't want to eat anything for few hours after she tried it first time. I even spiced it up a little bit hoping that she likes it but nope:(I don't blame her.I don't like it either.<br /><br />Update: Few months later I reintroduced my daughter this product and she seems to like it now. She ate it well for week when we were traveling. I ordered another one for our upcoming trip.

Chick Chick is great, Beef Stew is wonderful, but Gobble Gobble is weird.  My daughter didn't mind the taste, but I could not get over the texture.  It looked like a giant blob of wet dog food.  It was more putty-like than any other flavor.  I actually had to cut bites off of it.  I am grossed out just thinking about it.  Good thing there are other flavors.

review/summary: Too Thick
review/text: I bought this flavor along with two others and was surprised at how different the texture was compared to Chick Chick and Super Salmon. It is so thick that my daughter grabs it out of her mouth after putting a bite in, which usually leads to a big mess. I now have to modify the texture by adding water to it, which does not make it a convenient food item when on the go. Since the pouches don't reseal this is even harder when traveling.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor seems good, just too thick. I still love the pouch design for the most part, since I can sometimes break the glass jars of other brands. I will just need to remember to pack some sandwich baggies in case it not working out when trying to eat it on the go.

review/text: This stuff is so good I seriously almost ate it myself.  I don't know why people are saying that it is gross or bitter.  It tastes like ministrone (an italian tomato-based soup with pasta and veggies).  My 7 1/2 month old loves it.  He is a really good eater in general but actually makes little "mmms" when he eats this meal.  Definitely warm it up.  It is really yummy!  I like the suggestion to serve with Avacado.  We give him avacado almost every day and the creamy texture is a wonderful compliment to the tomato/acidic flavor of this meal.

review/summary: Reformulated for the worse
review/text: I used to be a huge fan of this.. wild salmon, 4g of protein, other great ingredients.. just ordered another 16 pack and discovered they have reformulated it to be completely different. It is really liquid-y.. impossible for an unskilled/careless self-feeder to have much left on the spoon by the time it gets to her mouth (may be okay for younger babies who aren't self-feeding yet though). Also it only has 1g of protein now - not sure why / if there is less salmon in it? Anyway, it's off the menu here, and I am disappointed to have lost a healthful, convenient option.

review/text: I have been making my son's baby food but needed a break since he's starting to eat more.  I only buy organic food for him and Chick Chick is one of his favorites.  I tasted it and it's a little bland for me but I'm also not a baby.  He loves it and as long as he does, I'll keep it stocked for him.  I love the Happy Baby/Happy Tot brand and the variety they offer.  I prefer jars for convenience but I just empty this into a jar to heat.  I did find that one of the pouches had a leak at a seam.  I'm glad that I saw it before I gave it to him.  Now I check them each thoroughly before I open them.  If I can squeeze food out of a seam, it gets pitched.

review/text: The Happy Baby Beef Stew was not much of a beef stew.  The second ingredient behind water was tomatoes and it was evident in the taste of the product.  It didn't seem to have even a trace taste of beef.  Because of the high tomato content, the stew was very acidic.  I was a bit disappointed by this product.

review/summary: Easy and Baby Loves It
review/text: My daughter loves Gobble Gobble.  I was a little surprised to see the reviews that said it is dry and tastes bad.  I wonder if those were bad packets.  The ones we've had have always been moist.  The food is a little bit bland, but it is not recommended to feed babies salt or spices, so it's about what I'd expect.  I like this better than the Chick Chick because it has a firmer texture.  To me, the Chick Chick is runny.  I normally spoon feed this to our baby, but if I don't mind cleaning up a mess I sometimes allow her to eat it with her hands.  We've never had any problems with gagging or choking.  When the packet is empty she's still looking for more.  I make most of my daughter's baby food and am very particular about what packaged foods I give to her.  I feel okay about this one because there are no weird preservatives and I can identify all of the ingredients.

After tasting it, I had to agree with him.  Maybe he does not like green peppers either.  If I recall correctly, the ingredients do not have yellow or red peppers as shown on the picture, but rather there are green peppers.  I was very disappointed as it looked good in the picture, it sounded nice & healthy, and my baby loves all their other products.  I'd suggest you try ONE pouch to see if you like it before you purchase several.

review/summary: Icky mama grain
review/text: First, the other happy baby flavors have been a hit with my baby and me.  But this mama grain is indescribable.  I knew it as soon as I opened the pouch...The smell is awful...But I figured we would try it anyway.  I only wish I had the video camera out...Baby didn't like this one at all and I can't blame him.  Recommend buying one pack regardless of the price before getting the 16 pack.

review/text: This should be called Sad Baby--it's awful. My baby absolutely hates it! I tasted a tiny bit<br />and it was bland to the point of gagging. Besides I assumed (wrongly obviously) that Stage 3<br />food--for babies 7+ months--would have some chunks of real food. Unfortunately, it's just glop,<br />and unfortunately, incredibly tasteless glop. I tried other flavors from this brand and they<br />were just as disgusting, my baby wont eat any of the flavors at all.

Since it comes 16 packages at a time, I have several packages leftover and now that he's almost 2, I still give it to my kid as a big appetizer while we order and wait for the food to come at restaurants.  He still loves it (despite being able to eat all sorts of "regular" food).  Much better than just loading up on tortilla chips at Mexican restaurants!

review/summary: My cats love this product
review/text: I really do like the Healthy Baby Baby foods.  I buy them with the Amazon Prime free shipping.  I also "subscribe and save".  I get 16 at a time.  The baby doesn't mine eating the same flavor each day for 16 days, but at the end of 16 days, he smells like cat food.  Most cats will run at the sound of a can opener, mine have learned to listened for the tearing of the pouch.  If you get this flavor and your baby hates it- you can always use it as cat food.  The texture of this particular product is pretty good for my now 10 month old.  I got a Sprout product with lentils in it and he spit the lentils out.  It is kind of hit and miss with the textures of these foods because their rating has no consistency.  That's my one- and constant- complaint.

review/summary: Blend your own baby food
review/text: I loved the stage 2 Spinach Mango Pear, although I found it too watery.  I had to add rice to get baby to eat it.  I got the stage 3 mama grain based on the fact that it is suggested for 7 month olds.  My baby is 9 months old and won't eat it.  I disagree that it tastes awful.  I'd eat it myself, but it is way too thick.  I got a case of it, so I'm going make it work.  So- I put the too watery stage 2 spinach mango pear and stage 3 mama grain in the blender and voila! Perfect texture.  Easy enough fix, however- I buy premade baby food because I don't want to blend my own.  I did with my 1st baby, but this is my 4th, and the novelty of making baby food, and the time required to do it- is long gone.  Happy Baby would do well to be more consistent in their labeling.  Their Stage 2 food should be 1.5, and this stage 3 should be 3.75.

review/summary: Recipe changed with no warning - packaging pictured is out of date
review/text: My twin boys have loved this product - they gobbled it up.  And as a mom, I loved it because it was very tasty and unique.  But also because it used a lot of veggies that my boys don't often get in their diet, like peppers and eggplant.  Since I last bought this product on Amazon the entire recipe has changed and there is no indication of such in the Amazon description.  It now is almost all carrots (something that my boys eat constantly) and quinoa.  No eggplant.  Only red peppers as one of the last ingredients.  And amaranth, for which it is named, went from ingredient number two, to the end of the ingredient list just above the spices.  It is not nearly as tasty in my opinion, either.  It looks and tastes a lot more like the Super Salmon.To be honest, this is just an entirely different product.  My boys still eat it, but I was disappointed and might not buy it again.

review/summary: Original Recipe was better.....baby no longer likes
review/text: Unfortunately they changed the recipe up on our baby....he looooooved this, it was a great trainer food as it was thicker now it's just runy like the chick chick one which we stopped buying.  One taste of the new formula and baby turned up his nose and didn't want anymore....I was presistant and eventually the only way he'll eat it is with bread dipped in it or his veggie stix dipped in it and I have to sneak in spoonfulls here and there.  It's just too runny for our baby boy now, he's older now but we still want to make sure he's getting salmon atleast once a week.  This is the most convenient for us so we still give it to him at 20 months.  I'm going to hunt down the original forumla's and stock up whenever I see them!  Other than that, we are a 100% HappyBaby family and love all the wonderful products they continue to make!

review/summary: Thumbs down for the new ingredient
review/text: I was a big fan of this product since it was the only baby food that contained salmon until the ingredient was changed. The decrease in the protein content from 4g (old) to 1g (new) makes me wonder how much salmon is actually in this pouch. I can even tell from the smell of the new version which doesn't smell like fish at all that there is very little salmon in it. Also, the new version added apples and increased the sugar content from 0g(old) to 3g(new) which I am not happy about.<br />My son still loves this pouch, but I purchased this product for nutritious reasons - very disappointed with the change!

The first bite was ok... a little different, the second bite..

It was kind of like chewing up a cardboard box... you can chew for awhile until it gets nasty and then almost have to plug your nose to swallow (if you can).<br /><br />I'm so sorry to give these a poor review because they really went to lengths to make a great product.

review/summary: I really wanted to like them
review/text: I did - I really wanted to like them, but was unable to get there. The first I had was untoasted, with lox and cream cheese. It was inedible. The second try was toasted, with lox and cream cheese - thus configured, it was edible, but not in any way enjoyable. I'd rather put the stuff on low carb scandinavian crisp bread. My wife reports a similar experience but she's not quite as negative as I. Even she can't take more than 1/2 a bagel at a time. So we've sliced them in half and frozen them, and plan to take them out 1/2 a bagel at a time for her to put strong flavored cheese on (such as an extra sharp cheddar or gouda) when she wants. She reports that with a strong enough flavored cheese, they are edible enough. That's not a sterling endorsement but if you want to try them 1. toast them 2. Put something strong enough to overcome the sawdust-like aftertaste 3. Repeat step 2.

review/text: This is a great flavor. It last a long time. Buying it in the multipack will save you a lot of money. This gum is addictive so you will be glad you bought it in bulk. I eat it half a stick at a time, the flavor is so strong. The mint chocolate chip is also the other best long lasting flavor in this series, Dessert Delights.

review/summary: great kit - better flavor
review/text: I always have a lot of ground venison at the end of the year and like to turn it all into summer sausage.  The summer sausage you get from the deer processing places, is nasty.  Having used a few different kits, as well as my own receipes, I have found this is the best for me.  You MUST used a cure, and what I like about this kit is the flavor, easy to mix and NOT TOO SALTY.  It has two 15lbs packs of cure/season and the casings for 30lbs of meat.<br /><br />I cold smoke first (like 120) then bring the temp up to finish.  The key is to NOT let the meat get above 170 (or all the juices run out).  The kit has exact directions, just follow them and you are good.  You do not have to smoke and, I also have done in my oven (convection oven works best), or a combo - where I cold smoke, then finish in the oven, where I can really control the exact temp.  Plan on 10 hours of total cook time.  I also sub 1/2 the water in this recipe for honey as it gives a nice flavor. (but I'm a beekeeper so I put honey in everything - that's just me)

review/summary: Great pretzels (too bad Amazon packed 'em so poorly)
review/text: These are yummy pretzels! A wonderful mix of traditional pretzel with a delicious peanut butter center!  I have to limit myself because once you start eating them, it's hard to stop.  Everyone at work loves, loves, loves these!  One MAJOR set-back - Amazon didn't pack 'em very well so they came with lots of broken pieces and really, who wants to eat peanut butter pretzel crumbs?  I'll buy them elsewhere but not from Amazon again.

review/summary: ENJOY GOING TO DENTIST
review/text: I loved Haribo candies when I was young living in France. I was disappointed to not see much of choices besides the gummy bears in stores. Amazon saved my life by introducing some great flavors. The sour colas are so good (I like it better than the regular colas). It's my favorite along with the strawberries.

Sweet and sour and chewy, sugar,<br /><br />yes. However.. no flour, butter or dairy...this was it!  I was addicted that day and spent two years trying to find them.<br /><br />They are addictive...hence the beware notice.  The grapefruit isn't a disappointment either.

review/summary: addicting flavor, a bit tough to chew
review/text: yum... these are a delicious alternative for those who like sour patch kids and other sweet/sour gummies, and they are definitely haribo quality.  my only complaint is the requirement that your jaw have the constitution of a bear trap to clamp down on some of these.  they're only slightly tough at first (and misleading with their deliciousness,) but once you've had a few your mouth puts up the white flag until you've given your choppers a chance to cool down.  i guess this can actually be seen as a good thing, because you are less prone to gorge on them (unlike the haribo gold bears, i just don't know when to quit with those).<br /><br />overall, very good.

review/text: So.  GOOD.  I eat candy all the time, and this is one of my favorites.  It's infinitely munchable, which is good and bad for self-control. ;)  Normal gummies bore me because there's just not that much excitement going on in your mouth.  But the fizzy sour powder provides a serious carbonated kick and I can alternate sucking/chewing for a PARTY IN MY MOUTH.  So good I ate way too much at once and was burping the entire day.

review/text: Haribo makes the best gummy candy. I love their regular Happy Cola and I love Trolli Sour Brite Worms. This is a sour version of Happy Cola to give you the best of both worlds - a double whammy bliss!!! And the fact that it's so hard to find around town makes me appreciate being able to order from Amazon.  The only bad thing is that they are so addictive.  Obviously not good for your body or teeth :(

review/text: I've ordered this fizzy cola three times. Two packs each time for the free shipping, so a total of 72 bags; yes I do love this candy with a passion.<br /><br />However, it seems the texture varies with each shipment. Twice I've received them soft like normal gummies. The third shipment was notably harder (not stale tasting, just not with the usual softness); I assume that's what some of the other reviews are talking about. To be honest, I'm not sure which texture I actually prefer. Both are delicious in their own way. If you really hate the harder style, I'll be happy to take them off your hands should you choose to throw them away. :3

review/summary: Fizzy Cola tastes like Coca Cola
review/text: I've bought every candy possible. I've tried every one of the top 50 candies Amazon sells. Haribo Fizzy Colas are the best IMO. Fizzy Cola and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7SYLG">Zotz Fizz Power Candy, Cherry, Apple, and Watermelon Flavors (Pack of 48)</a> are my 2 favorites. I've tested these out with at least 20 people and everyone agrees that Fizzy Colas are awesome. They have a very distinct cola taste. The usual reaction is "Mmmm, these are good, do you have more?" Great for making friends with co-workers.

review/text: I am a big fan of most of the Haribo products. My dad brought them back from Germany for me and I always bought loads when I was over there. So, finding these so close to home has been super (for my taste buds, maybe not so much for my waist :-)  I had never tried the FIZZY COLA even tho the regualr HAPPY COLA was my favorite...well, step aside Happy, FIZZY's definitely are now my #1 faves. Great gummi texture that is perfectly chewy. The sour coating is beyond belief, with just the right amount of sweet, making the sour just this side of not tolerable - which is exactly how I want my sour candies...of course, with the gummi being sweet, the sour is just an initial pucker and the whole blending of flavor is the ultimate in satisfaction.!  Haribo Rules when it comes to Gummi candies!!

These are my new favorites.  They have the firm Haribo gummi texture that I love, and the flavor is yummy.

I like it, but I have to use it in moderation.<br /><br />The consistency is great, the sour with the coke bottle flavor is a unique experience.  Again, you can't go wrong with the Haribo line  (except for some of their weird fruit lines)
