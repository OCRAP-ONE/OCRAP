review/summary: great for dogs of all sizes
review/text: I would say that these are perhaps even better for small dogs than you'd think, because they're so huge that they can't be swallowed. The only problem is if your pup tries to eat the whole thing in one sitting, it may cause a bit of intestinal grumbling.<br /><br />My Jack Russell Terror loves them, and she NEVER chews anything, so that's quite an accomplishment. It keeps her busy, does a number on her teeth, and is just generally a great time-waster all around. They are a bit smelly but as long as I give her an appropriate surface to chew on (ex. a towel on the floor), she doesn't try to bring them up on the furniture.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that there are a LOT of tiny pieces left in the bottom of the bag, which aren't so useful because I have to supervise my dog pretty closely when she eats these.

review/summary: My dog likes them
review/text: My 10 month old Boxer puppy really likes these.  They do have a stinky smell, but it doesn't waft throughout the house so it doesn't bother me.  I wish they lasted longer.  She makes pretty short work of them, and I'd really like to find a chew that would keep her busy longer than 15 minutes!  Price was fairly reasonable in comparison to other similar products I've purchased.

review/summary: The dogs LOVE these!!!
review/text: The dogs prefer this chew treat over any other! (and I've tried at least 30 different treats/chews in all sizes.) Even though they like most treats, this one wins for chew time and flavor. I have two Lab mixes (both 4 years old) and they both stay occupied for quite a while with these. My female tends to chew them into less large pieces but still good sized chunks then swallow fast so she can have another. At first I have to watch her and make her realize she needs to "chew." My male absolutely savors them. He gets one, finds a good spot, circles, then settles in to chew and absorb the flavor. My dogs are big - 85 and 95 pounds - so it takes about 3-4 pieces each for them to settle down for a nap.<br /><br />Yes, as other reviews mention, these chews have a scent. But it is a BEEF scent. I actually don't mind the "aroma" and as long as the dogs don't leave one lying around (never) then the scent isn't going to linger. I don't even notice it when they are sitting next to me chewing. I think that if your dog is very tuned into you and your emotions, moods, or thoughts, and you scowl and think you don't like the scent, your dog might have a hard time taking to this treat because he/she will sense your disapproval.<br /><br />As for digging around in the bag or tin to find the right size piece, I agree that I do this because my two dogs are different. But I've solved this by using a sandwich baggie on my hand like a glove. The baggies with a fold top are fairly thin and easy to use and of course disposable. This prevents the scent from lingering on my hands. So I hope you try this chew - these are the perfect treat for the DOG. (In my opinion of course.)

review/text: Our Boxer girl loves these and sometimes she won't chew a larger pizzle/bully stick... She's not typically picky, but seems to particularly love these, and they occupy her for about a half hour or so.  Be advised: They're smellier than your typical bully stick in progress, so we send her out to the deck or yard with them.

review/summary: Great treats for dogs!
review/text: We have a little 35 pound pit/mix and he eats these in about 3 minutes.  He grabs it, then goes to a certain spot on our rug to chew it up.  So if you have a breed with a powerful set of jaws, you shouldn't have a problem with them stinking or being left around the house.  Most dogs love these things, because they are more appetising, and easier to digest than rawhide (they are also more nutritious).  Other great thing about these things, is that it helps clean their teeth, and lets them expend a bit of energy.<br /><br />A doggy's jaw needs some excercise, which it doesn't really get chewing on kibble.  These make great treats.  Our dog used to get separation anxiety when we left, but we started giving him treats right before leaving, and he'd go chew it up as we left, and he stopped getting getting anxious about us leaving.

review/text: I have 6 little dogs so I know dog treats! I usually order the chicken sticks but thought I would give these beef sticks a shot. My dogs take them but then drop them on the floor, which is where they stay. But on the chicken sticks, they are gobbled up quickly, which reminds me, I need to order another barrel of those tasty treats today! As for this experiment, I won't buy them again, dogs know what they like and it isn't these sticks.

review/summary: Softer than Bully Sticks. Perfect for smaller dogs.
review/text: I purchased these as a low cost alternative to Bully Sticks. They are too soft for our 48lb PitMix who simply crunches them like tortilla chips, but perfect for our Mini (11lb) Dachshund who loves them. While softer than bully sticks, it still takes her several "sessions" to finish a single tendon strip. They have a slight odor, but more like a smoked Slim Jim than the "stink" of a bully stick.

review/summary: My dogs' favorite treat
review/text: I cut these in half and my small, spoiled, often fussy dogs line up for their pieces and dance with joy.  So cute!  They usually get bored getting the same treat again and again -- except for these, which I suspect they'd gobble every day if I let them.  I keep it to 3 times a week, usually as a lunch meal for them, so they digest it fully before dinner time.  No one's ever had a tummy ache from it and they slowly chew away at their pieces for a long, happy hour.  One note to humans: wash your hands carefully and thoroughly after handling these.  They're kind of greasy and yucky, which is no doubt part of their charm for my dog babies.

Our holistic vet advises to never feed irradiated or "high-pressure pasturised" products to animals.  It's not worth the risk and it definitely puts more toxic junk into their systems.<br /><br />Merrick is not great either.  They own their own rendering plant in TX.

review/summary: Cadet Beef Tendons Canine Treats Not as Depicted!!
review/text: First, I waited for over two weeks to get what appeared to be a good alternative to the chicken sticks that my Shih Tzus love. Imagine my disgust when I opened the box of Cadet Natural Beef Tendons Canine Treats and found black bugs in the bag and in the packing box. In addition, the Cadet treats are not as depicted in the picture. I expected sticks, not these humongous strips, fit for a Great Dane. I immediately dumped the whole box into the trash, called Amazon, who were very apologetic and immediately refunded my purchase. Thank you, Amazon!  But shame on Cadet! I am boycotting all of their products and will never buy another item from them, ever!!! The lesson for me is read the customer reviews.  Had I done so, I would have avoided the whole horrible experience and I wouldn't be making chicken strips for my Shih Tzus right now. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BY50BY">Cadet 1-Pound Bag 100-Percent Natural Beef Tendons Canine Treats</a>

review/summary: Rigid and Pointy, Take Care
review/text: These chews are quite rigid and they have some sharp points on them.  We have had some bloody stool with these so I will not be buying again.  Part of this may be my dog not chewing them thoroughly so if your dog chews carefully you may have a better experience.  I have a beagle that's kind of a chow hound so probably the pieces get swallowed before they're truly ready to go.  But I also buy bison or buffalo tendons and have never had that problem with them.  They seem to be softer, more fleshy.  This is also true of things like bully sticks and yak milk chews, whether they are not as sharp or they digest easier, I'm not sure but we've had no problems.  I may look for another brand and see if we have a better experience with those, as the beef tendons are definitely more cost effective than the bison tendons.

I keep these and the bully sticks in my freezer.  The frozen bully stick keeps my labrador busy for a few hours.  These treats are gone before my car has left the driveway.  For the reviews that say this product is smelly, keeping it in the freezer in a freezer baggie solves that problem.

review/text: These are made out of dried beef tendon, which besides being tasty for your pup, is great for their dental health.  These are very competitively priced and are of high quality.  The only drawback is that they are a little rich if you have a small dog, so I would limit to 1 a day if you do.  More than that you could cause loose stool for your pup, but you get that with any rich treats you give your dog and is not unique to this item.

review/summary: where made?
review/text: I haven't purchased this but giving 3 stars because its description doesn't specify where they're made. There have recently been dogs dying from eating dried chicken products from China (such as those chicken wrapped apples and yam treats my dog loved so). That's not the first dog food product from there that there's been an issue with. From now on, just to be safe, I will only purchase USA products and I won't buy unless I know that's where it's made.

review/summary: Best grass fed Beef around!
review/text: Do not buy grass fed beef from Australia or other countries where we only add to the carbon footprint by importing foreign grass fed beef. America has some of the best beef in the world, and Rocky Mountain beef sells for the same price as upscale grain-fed beef, with a better flavor and a healthier content. I recommend ordering over $200. of beef- try the ground beef as well- as you save on shipping. It arrives frozen and stays fresh in your freezer until use. Excellent customer service.

review/summary: Strawberry and Cream Is My Favorite Flavor!
review/text: The strawberry and cream is my favorite flavor among all the offerings. See my review on the summer peaches flavor for more details.<br /><br />I just wish the company would sell a mixed pack rather than one flavor among the 12-pack. 12 bags of one flavor is a lot to order at one time (but I share it among family members so it goes quickly), so it would be nice if this option were available.<br /><br />Anyway, these goodies are made with sea lettuce, although you would never ever guess! They are not has hard as the "real" gummi bears but just as tasty. Probably more tasty because there is no artificial after taste.<br /><br />These gummis are gelatin free, fat free, dairy free, gluten free and have all natural colors and flavors. Yeah!

review/summary: +Super Food +Great Taste +Weight Loss Tool -Bloated Price
review/text: This snack food is terrific and highly recommended. The taste is great. Even our stubborn teenage son likes them (after strongly resisting trying them) and we're a red-blooded, All-American meat eating family.  They have a nice lightly roasted, slightly nutty flavor that along with their crispiness make them a bit addictive like potato chips, but they're way healthier.<br /><br />Seaweed is a Super Food and great for snacks as well as incorporation into your cooking.  Search the web.  Try "Nori wiki" and/or "Seaweed Nutrition by LiveStrong.com". You'll find that "Seaweeds generally contain ten to twenty times the minerals of land plants and many other vitamins needed for metabolic processes."  It's particularly high in iodine (combats hypothyroidism) calcium, iron, potassium, selenium, Vitamin A, B12, C, and Folate.  And when it comes to it's fiber to calorie ratio, its hard to beat.  Each 30 calorie serving contains a full gram of fiber and is essentially carb free.  Few convenient and delicious snack foods can boast such nutritional value.<br /><br />The 30 calories per serving come from relatively healthy unsaturated fats and protein.  This has the benefit of satiating your appetite.  A few servings with water will actually take the edge off your hunger -- rather than spiking your blood sugar and feeding you hunger as many carb based snack foods do.  This ability to curb hunger pangs without a lot of calories, great taste and the handy individually wrapped crush-resistant trays (4.25"L x 3.25"W x 1.75" H) which can be easily stashed in the car, backpack, lunch bag, etc. make them a great tool in any weight loss or maintenance program.  Reach for one when you get a craving and you'll likely avoid pigging out on expensive, high-calorie junk food.<br /><br />We give Jayone's product 5+ stars at the $6.79 Costco price for the same quantity.  Jayone's current $18.65 online price (~3x as much!) is partially justified because of convenient shipping, but is at least $5-6 too high to be good value online which we'd give only 3 stars. Buy if you can afford to, but you'll likely need to restrain your consumption well below the optimal level.<br /><br />Come on Jayone price this product fairly and make them more popular on Amazon.  You'll likely make a lot more money by satisfying a public hungry for delicious & healthy snack foods that don't promote weight gain.

review/summary: Exotic Seaweed...
review/text: I never consume any process food since I stay away from fat, sugar and salt. The only processed food that I consume is organic soy milk. Seaweed is not something that I can prepare myself. It comes with ingredients that I could care less for like canola oil which is a man made product since there is no seed or plant created by god called canola and that is why you will never see ORGANIC canola. Furthermore it is not produced in US either. I consume Jayone since it has less salt than Sea's Gift Seaweed although both are owned by the same company. Seaweed is great with beer or stand alone. The way it comes in small packages is great since I give away as a treat to everyone and majority of people never ever had one so it is a good surprise. It is a very unique food and worth trying it out. Seaweed snacks are sheets of dehydrated seaweed that has been roasted. Thin like paper sheets cut in 2" by 3" and there is like 10 of those in each package. It is not fulfilling since it is not a snack, it is more like a treat. I consume this any time that I want a gum or something different. Since I do not have to keep it cold, it is great since I take to the beach and mountain biking. I leave some in my car as well. Exotic is the word for this processed food. Bravo.

review/summary: I really love these for snacks at work.
review/text: I hate that people are giving these a low rating because of cost . . . since you aren't rating the seller. Different sellers can have this, the rating appears on all of them. YOU decide, when you buy it, that the cost is good or bad for you. It has nothing to do with product review.<br /><br />That said, I think that this is a great product. I eat these at my desk every day, as I have blood sugar issues and can't eat high-carb snacks. There are just *so* few crunch snacks that don't have carbs. These have a great extra flavor from the sesame oil, and are lightly salted (only 2% of daily salt intake, as compared with 250% more for a small bag of chips . . . and 50% less than the seaweed that comes in the little condiment-sized packets). Yes, the packaging takes up WAY more space than the condiment-sized packets, but the flavor and crunchiness makes up for it. They are much thinner, and much bigger sheets, and more natural (rather than pressed perfectly flat).<br /><br />It is true, you can buy them for WAY less at Costco. However for the people who bought them here and complained about the extra price, why did they buy them? There's no gun to your head. The honest truth is that I'm looking online for snack food . . . I'm lazy and want my snack food delivered to me. If I wanted to get up and go to Costco, I'd also probably be less lazy (and perhaps not eating snack food). :)

review/summary: Best puppy treat out there
review/text: My Cavalier King Charles Spaniel will be 8 years old next month and I still give her these. I bought these when I first brought her home when she was 8 weeks old and began giving them to her for training purposes. On the advice of the woman running the puppy training class, I didn't give her the entire biscuit. I take each biscuit and break it by hand into 6 pieces. Each one is just bite size for a puppy. I still keep a jar of these by the door and give her a treat when she comes inside after "doing her business". Even after almost 8 years, she still loves them.<br /><br />I do go through and break up about a jar's worth of biscuits at a time so I don't have to mess with it each time. It also has the advantage of reducing the amount of calories she is consuming since Cavaliers have a tendancy to put on too much weight. She feels like she is getting a treat without actually getting all that much.<br /><br />The is the second dog I have done this with and these are the best treats out there for that purpose.<br /><br />I, too, came to Amazon to look for these as my Walmart has discontinued carrying them/

review/text: When the first ingredient is water, I have to ask myself what I'm paying for?  I have tried two of the six dressings so far and I'm not impressed with the flavors or ingredients.  The Cilantro Lime didn't taste like either and the Feta cheese and Calamata olives was lacking in taste too.  My suggestion is to buy some good extra virgin olive oil and a vinegar you like and make your own dressing.  I will not be buying this again and will probably end up using it as a marinade since it's not good on salads.  If you add some salt the taste is a bit better but far from what I expected.

If you are someone who has trouble with certain textures of foods, I would recommend buying a smaller-sized bag of quinoa to make sure the texture is bothersome.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /> - A fantastic product! As someone who is a very involved with weight training, this is going to fit my dietary needs perfectly.

Those of us who eat complex carbs for weightlifting purposes, eating six to seven or more meals a day, know the daunting task of getting enough complex carbs through food without eating cup after cup of bulky brown rice, this is the perfect replacement, in my opinion.

review/text: I bought this about 4 months ago when Roland products were on sale. I just finished my 2nd semester of college and came home. A few days ago I opened the bag, which was sealed extremely well I mean its sealed, but it also has a thin rope to hold it together.(Might take a bit to open depending) I used one cup of quinoa and two cups of water. I made it like rice; adding sea salt to the water. 20 mins later, it was done. The quinoa does expand 3-4 times its size. The taste and texture is something that grows on you. When I first ate it I couldn't finish it. It was very filling.(which is a good thing) While it was cooking I grilled green pepper and onion in olive oil. I added some kalamata olives to the mix as well.  I don't think I'd eat it by itself just yet.<br /><br />In terms of Cooking, it cooks almost like rice. Using the left overs from the day before, I made fried quinoa like I would make fried rice. It was delicious!<br /><br />It is definitely healthy and with the rate seasoning and foods, tasty.<br /><br />Best Wishes,<br />  E.A.C

review/text: I was a little hesitant about ordering such a large bag of quinoa after reading so many stories on different brands having to be rinsed so they wouldn't be bitter and to wash out debri. When I got it, I didn't think I would be able to rinse it without washing much of it down the sink because the grains are very small and they float. So I took my chances, and cooked it as is. I had never tasted quinoa before so I didn't know what to expect. I prepared it in the same way that I do rice. I use chicken broth instead of water, and add a couple of bay leaves, onion and garlic powders, a little salt, olive oil, and a little ground cumin. My husband and I both liked it very much. So I now have a subscription for delivery every other month. Since quinoa has so many health benefits and enough amino acids to provide a full protein, I also add it to the cooked food that I make for my parrots. Since I also make all of our bread, I plan to add cooked quinoa to some of my bread recipes to increase the nutritional value of my bread. At the rate we are using it, I may have to change my subscription to 25 lbs. every month.<br /><br />Roland quinoa is a very clean and quality product that I would recommend to anyone trying to provide a healthy diet for themselves and their family.

review/text: Now we have this super food in bulk for less than half the price offered per pound at Whole Foods ($6 a pound). This is the white quinoa, which is our favorite. It is now even on subscribe and save. What a deal! With a lower glycemic index than brown rice and much more fiber too, this food will help me lose pounds while making my body feel great.

review/text: I absolutely LOVE this flavor!! It is so nice to be able to drink a "diet soda" and not get a migraine afterwards. It is all natural and there is little to no aftertaste. For my taste, this could have a bit more of the grapefruit flavor, but it is by far my favorite of the Zevia line. It reminds me a bit like Fresca in that nice crisp, refreshing flavor.

review/summary: Disappointed!
review/text: For some time, I had been waiting for a stevia-based cola. I took a risk when I found this Zevia on Amazon.com, especially since you had to put out almost $30 for a 24-pack.  My initial order was for the Black Cherry and the Caffeine Free.  Thankfully, they were great tasting and well worth the expense.  Without hesitation, I returned to Amazon.com to try the Grapefruit Citrus, as I have been a fan of Fresca for years but not the aspartame they use.  Sadly, this did not measure up to expectations, not even close.  The taste and odor are pungent (almost "bodily fluid"-pungent) and I could not finish even one can.  I will probably reorder the caffeine free but, unfortuntely,  will not be able to return this cola because of Amazon's return policy on grocery items.  I don't begrudge the policy, just the loss.  In fact, it is this loss which inspired me to write this review because I (and I'm sure I'm not alone) base a good amount of my purchases on the online reviews of a product.  It is not my contention that I speak for everyone; but, if my opinion helps someone's decision-making process, it would be worth it.

review/summary: I don't like the way this product tastes.
review/text: We've got three people in the house, and we're all quitting sugar (at least as much as is possible).  We all agree that the aftertaste in all of these products is utterly terrible.  I've gone to straight water, with a bit of lemon juice.  My wife and the roommate are drinking NutraSweet and Sucralose, respectively.  Let's just say that the search continues for a non-caloric sweetner that doesn't taste like a punishment.<br /><br />I think it's great that there are some people out there who can learn to drink this.  But for my household, the unanimous response is that this product is a no-go.

review/summary: Better than other Zevia
review/text: I've tried the Mountain Zevia (yuck) & the Ginger Ale Zevia(partial yuck).  The Grapefruit Citrus is better than the other two.  By better I mean that I could actually finish the can.  The flavorings in the soda are pretty good, but could be a little stronger.  It leaves an odd aftertaste that must come from the stevia.  All three flavors I've tried have an aftertaste.  The aftertaste seems to vary from flavor to flavor though.  I love stevia & use it all the time, but it just doesn't taste right in the soda.

We use sea salt and kosher salt, and the containers they come in make it very hard to get a "pinch" of salt.  This server makes getting a pinch or a teaspoon so easy!  Plus it looks nice on the table.<br /><br />My only wish is that it was easier to keep the stainless steel lid clean and free of fingerprints.

review/text: As another reviewer pointed out, this is NOT the same salt cellar as AB uses. I have both, and this one is better.<br /><br />Unlike AB's this one has a silicone gasket on the inside of the lid, which effectively seals out moisture, and more importantly, smells in.<br /><br />I purchased this one to use as a sugar bowl, hoping the seal would keep the ants out. My previous sugar bowls did not have air-tight lids and had to be retired during the summer, lest we find black six-legged critters happily munching on the contents. For the past two summer "ant seasons" this bowl has kept the critters at bay.<br /><br />While AB's is fine for salt, this would be better than his for that, too.<br /><br />Choosing between AB's and this one? I recommend this one. Well worth the extra $1.06!

Some reviewers stated that this server was hard to hold and others said it did not have a thumb tab on top for opening, it does.<br /><br />I can't imagine a better product, unless the server was made out of solid stainless. But then again, it would cost much more than this one and you really can't tell from the top unless you turn it over to look at the bottom side. Of course you wouldn't want to do that when it has salt in it.

I couldn't find any solder or a weld joint.<br /><br />To echo the some of the other reviews this is most definitely NOT the one used by Alton Brown. The lack of the vertical handle is a shortcoming when you try to open it one handed off of the counter.

review/text: This is a great salt container. Extremely similar to the one used on Good Eats. It comes with a little tiny spoon that does not keep the lid open if the spoon is in the container. There isn't a hole in the lid or in the glass rim either for the handle of the spoon since it fits nicely inside the glass container itself. That's a great thing, so the lid completely closes on the glass rim.

review/summary: Sort of what I needed
review/text: I purchased this so that I could have kosher salt out on the counter and easily accessible. It is sort of awkward to hold because the base is bigger than the bowl, the glass bowl is a bit heavy, and the holder and tab for opening is close to the bowl. It takes some getting used to and now I don't really pick it up to use it. I just keep it close and open it. There is a rubber band along the inside of the lid and it has these weird dots along the rim that show on the outside. They keep the rubber band in place but look silly along the outside, I didn't know what it was at first and tried to scrap a 'dot' off not realizing it was part of the band. In a high moisture area I'm sure the salt would get clumpy, I use the kosher salt with no caking agent. And the spoon, it is so small it is useless.

review/text: Have been using this for a few weeks. I like how it looks on the counter, and I like having the salt within reach while cooking. However, it came out of the box with the lid hinge bent, and so the lid didn't lay flat on the glass bowl. We had to bend it carefully to get it to lay properly on top of the glass. (I didn't want to hassle with packaging it up to return it.) I'm not convinced it is a tight fit and I'm worried about moisture in the summertime. My 2 year old daughter adopted the teeny little spoon as soon as I opened the package, and I haven't seen it since. I usually just pinch the salt out with my fingers anyhow.

review/text: I bought 2 of these 3 years ago after seeing it in an episode of Good Eats. I am happy with the purchase, I've used it mainly for salt - kosher in one and a rotating special sea salt with the other. The only downsides I could think of is the clinking noise it makes when you put it down as an earlier reviewer mentioned. That could be fix if you use a coaster (I'm thinking of picking up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ASUGLM">Gama-Go 45 Coasters, Set of 4</a> as it looks like it would keep it in place. I also wish that there's a place to put the spoon since I don't use it often but if I put it away, I know I'll forget about it so maybe I'll fashion some sort of pocket for it underneath. I like this one a lot.

review/text: It may not be exactly what Alton uses but it's close enough. Despite a warning against putting it in a dishwasher, I put the spoon, which is Stainless Steel, and the glass bowl through a cycle (the glass in the upper tray) and they did fine. I'm not sure if it would be safe to put the base in a dishwasher but that part is not likely to need cleaning often. It's nice the spoon is small enough to fit inside the bowl and stays with the salt server while it is closed. The reviews of similar products with larger spoons complain that the spoon sticking out of the bowl makes it impossible to close tightly and the salt clumps as a result. The smaller spoon fitting inside the salt container eliminates that problem. Though I wish the bowl of the spoon was a little bigger.<br />All and all I'm pleased. It's exactly what I needed.

review/text: this is the classic "alton brown" salt cellar - almost. it consists of a glass cup that sits in a steel frame with a steel lid that is kept tight by a silicone gasket.<br /><br />however - be aware that, unlike alton brown's model, this one does not have a curved, trigger-style handle. this means that opening it and holding it up at the same time cannot be done. you must first open it and then bring it up. i have a  cheaper model with a trigger handle, and while it's much, much easier to use, it lacks the silicone gasket and it has a notch for a small spoon, both of which pose a problem in keeping salt from the elements. so i have chosen to keep this one. had it had a trigger handle, it would rate five stars.

review/text: Had been looking for this item for a long time, but was a little worried by the statement in some of the reviews that the handle design causes a problem.  Since the handle is flat, it is difficult to pick up the server and then open the lid with one hand.  The secret is to place the thumb on the lid tab with the fingers under the handle, and then open the lid by pressing the thumb down before, or at the same time as, you lift the server.  This is very stable and you can then carry and use the server easily.

review/summary: Exactly what I wanted
review/text: I bought this based on Alton Brown's recommendations.  It works well, keeps the salt clean and dry.  No clumping.  It comes with a tiny little spoon that fits inside the container.

review/summary: Alton's version still the best one out there
review/text: I was looking for three things in a salt container:<br /><br />1. One-handed operation. Somehow one hand is always wet during cooking, so I wanted to be able to use one hand to get at the salt. You don't have to use the metal handle near the hinge because the lid flips open with one finger very easily.<br /><br />2. A non-removable lid. Because I intended to keep this on the counter, some dust protection was necessary. Also, some containers have fully removable lids, which is terrible design because once the lid comes off, it takes up precious counter space.<br /><br />3. Easy to clean. Sometimes things get spilled on the counter and the glass and metal are much easier to keep clean than wood or bamboo.<br /><br />The tiny spoon is cute, and it's nice for precise salting. The inner glass container can be very easily lifted out for pouring and refilling. Overall a really smartly designed container.

review/summary: Excellent Salt Cellar
review/text: I am very pleased with the salt cellar from RSVP Endurance. I like the fact that it seals in freshness, I had purchased a different one years ago and it had a slit in the lid that didn't keep my kosher salt fresh. If you are looking for something to keep your condiments in, you won't go wrong with this item. It looks beautiful on my counter.
