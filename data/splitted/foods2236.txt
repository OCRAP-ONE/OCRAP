review/summary: Must taste good :)
review/text: I fed this to my grandson and he ate the whole pouch. I couldn't believe it. When I read it was garden greens and pear juice I thought it sounded nasty but my grandson loved it. Of course I have never found anything he doesn't like but he seemed to really eat this up much faster. and its nutritious :)

review/summary: Well-liked at our house
review/text: I tried a little bit before handing it over to the baby (20 months old), and I was surprised at how tart it was.  The first ingredient is pear, so I expected it to be a little bit sweeter.  But, the little guy didn't even seem to notice.<br /><br />Not sure if it is the novelty of eating from a pouch, or if he didn't notice the tartness, but it was gone in under 2 minutes.<br /><br />I like the pouches as they are easy for babies to self-feed (less messy!) and good for times when we are out.<br /><br />The current price (at nearly $2/pouch on S&S) is a bit high for my budget.  I've compared to the varieties at the store, and they tend to be cheaper, even for the organic ones.<br /><br />However, I felt good knowing that there were no "funny" ingredients in these pouches.  I would certainly recommend them.

review/summary: Snuck Veggies on my older kids!
review/text: I have extremely picky little boys. I give them vitamins every day, but I would prefer they get what they need from their foods. I passed this off as "pear sauce" with dinner and both children ate every bite of it. The 5 year old said it was great and the 2 year old declared it delicious! They both dipped french fries in at and said it was great that way.<br /><br />I tested a couple of spoon fulls. The color was kinda greeny brownish and that was a little off-putting. I don't know how neither boy noticed the green flecks in it. I couldn't tell if that was the spinach or broccoli. Didn't matter though. The overwhelming flavor was the pear. It was sweet enough to cover the veggie flavors, but it didn't completely mask them.<br /><br />I consider it a success. And no, I don't feel bad about giving them baby food. The product is organic, gluten free (we may have an allergy), unsweetened, natural and full of good stuff. This flavor has no fat, sodium or calcium. It does provide (1/2 package is serving size) 2% DV Protein, 25% Vitamin A, 70% Vitamin C, and 2% Iron in each serving.<br /><br />Just a note, we served it room temperature, but I've put a pouch in the fridge for going with breakfast tomorrow.<br /><br />UPDATE: We tried it cold and they both thought it tasted better. I didn't notice a difference, but the kids ate more of it when it was cold. They dipped tortilla chips in it this time and said it made them "taste fancy".

review/summary: Well, the baby likes it
review/text: After figuring out how to open these little pouches I have discovered that our baby seems to love them. While some people say they can "drink" them right out of the package, I squeeze mine into the bowl and use a spoon. Either way he loves them. I don't know that they are any different from baby food in a jar, but they are convenient for on the go and disposal.

review/summary: Tastes great, Me and Baby agree!
review/text: I am not usually a fan of green vegetables, personally.  In fact, it is a joke around our house that I will not eat anything green.  I tried this product first, myself, before feeding it to a friend's little one.  It actually tastes great!  No sugar, all organic, lots of vitamins and babies like it too!<br /><br />My only complaint is with the cap.....it's small enough to be swallowed, so pay attention when feeding.  Maybe the company will find a way to keep the cap attacned to the package, by a tab or something, to make it safer.<br /><br />Tastes good, good for you both.  Can't ask for more than that

review/summary: Not just for little babies
review/text: I work in a special needs clinic, and sometimes our babies/toddlers are really picky, have massive food allergies. A lot of the parents are now ONLY feeding kids Organic to make sure there isn't any processed nonsense and pesticides in the food.<br /><br />Most of the kids have not turned down this baby food, and its so easy to just squeeze a bit out, replace the cap and send it home with the parents if they love it. I have even seen kids carrying it around like a sippy cup and just squeezing away!<br /><br />It doesnt have to be refrigerated until you open it. And also make sure to check the expiration date because the batch I got was only good till June.

review/summary: Nutritious for baby
review/text: Baby Gourmet has come up with a wonderful, healthy, delicious way for my baby to get the nutrients she needs with none of the artificial additives that she doesn't need. It is organic, unsweetened, unsalted, gluten free, nut free, BPA free, dairy, egg and lactose free, and has no fillers or thickeners. The pear makes it taste slightly sweet and masks any bitterness from the broccoli and spinach.<br /><br />The packaging is convenient if you want to serve just a portion and save the rest for another time. You can squeeze the amount you want out of the 4.5 ounce package and screw the lid back on. I do worry that the lid could come loose or the package get punctured in my diaper bag, but I tend to put all soft foods and liquids in a Ziploc bag for extra protection in the event that happens. I do not have that concern so much with Gerber jars, but this Baby Gourmet packaging seems less likely to lose its lid than the common plastic Gerber containers do.<br /><br />My baby enjoys the flavor of the Juicy Pear and Garden Greens food and will usually eat the whole package in one sitting. An added bonus, my five year old thinks they are Crushers and eats them too. So it can be a healthy snack for older kids as well. This is a baby food I feel good about feeding to my kids.

review/text: I have to say that this baby-food was a nice surprise. It smells like real food and babies love it. I like that it is easy to feel a bowl, take how much you need,then put the cap back on into the fridge. My daughter loves the Garden Beans as well. Really nice surprise because she is a finicky eater.I really liked that its easy to heat up as well take on the go. I am always out so this fits great when out to the park or friends house.

review/summary: Good tasting, portable, and convenient
review/text: When it comes to our little ones, we want to make sure they're getting the best. This Baby Gourmet product is a high-quality product, manufactured in Canada, and certified organic by QAI and USDA, it is made from organic, all-natural ingredients (organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinic, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), organic lemon juice concentrate). There are no added fillers, added sugars, or any artificial additives. The taste is good, with about the consistency and color of apple sauce. It's got enough sweetness to make the blend palpable. The broccoli does have an overcooked taste to it however.<br /><br />The soft pouch is durable, compact, and portable. It's ready to serve warm or cold. To serve warm, stand in some hot water for a few minutes, or microwave the contents in a separate bowl. The pouch itself is not microwavable. Nutritionally, this product doesn't contain much besides Vitamin A (25%) and Vitamin C (70%). Protein is 2%, Iron 2%, Calcium 0% of the recommended daily value.<br /><br />It is gluten-free, nut-free, daily/egg/lactose free, and kosher. As the cap is a choking hazard, parents need to keep it away from baby. Additionally, the edges of the pouch are very stiff, which may poke sensitive baby parts.

review/summary: Awesome! Not Just for Babies, Also for those ordered by Doctors to be on Soft Diet
review/text: This is truly amazing, once this arrived; opened box, found them in nicely stacked foil pouches. Small enough for a baby's mouth and yet at the same time is fitting for an Adult likewise who have been ordered on soft food diet (Stage 1 - Puree) or depending on what the Physician has instructed.  I am already on well-known brand name products but there is no comparison with this Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1. Literally had to grab the boxes to compare what's in there and was literally shocked to find out so much of artificial and natural, plus fillers, and concentrate, and yadda, yadda, yadda ... on these brand name products. Not only that, the label on the Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1 was very simple; while the shelf life itself will be short because it is all natural.<br /><br />All in all; it is fitting not just for babies, but also for those who have been instructed by Surgeons to Physicians on Soft Food Diet - who are literally sick of this canned repetitive "Broth, Liquids, and Jell-O" when one has a craving for "REAL FOOD", like Steak, Lobster, Salad, Cheesecake, for example ... stuff "Big People can eat".<br /><br />The differences was remarkable! It was not watered down, but yet, was very tasty and addicting. It neither upset my stomach or digestive system even after the harsh medications after taking it, was very soothing.  The other brand names, were kind of frustrating for me (due to nature of injury and then having fallen on Sunday, the day before this arrived from my walker which result more injuries as if I needed it - which result a trip to the hospital that which the photo image shows the Hospital tags) also was instructed to continue on the medications and stay on the soft diet since not able to handle solid foods yet.<br /><br />My elderly mother went out to look for more of these, later then informed me that she wasn't able to find them anywhere only then I noticed they hailed from Canada. Oh Canada, can you teach America to make great foods like these? For not only they are delicious but I will be upfront and first to admit... I was unsure about having Pears, Broccoli, and Spinach all mixed together - I love them all, but together? I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, but really, it is very, very good.<br /><br />In my humble opinion - this is excellent for people not just restricted to soft diet with the Doctor's approval, but those with specific medical conditions but not in the late stages where choking is a hazard.<br /><br />It needs no refrigeration unless you had opened it and didn't use it all, it can be closed and used up within 24 hours. It also can be served at room temperature or cold.<br /><br />All in all - I strongly recommend this, the bad thing about it is, I wished this was around when my son was a baby nearly 28 years ago - for this would be the proper food for babies, after having read the packaging and what's all in there, scared me; I never did pay heed to it at all, for I only stuck to the brand name I trusted because it was the same ones that my parents fed my sister and I or have times changed?<br /><br />I also asked my married son to pull out his baby spoon, while he knew not why I asked for it; but what I did was a comparison between the brand names and this on that spoon.  After I squeezed this into the spoon, The looks of it was very appealing to a baby (I know because I have often fed my granddaughter when she was a baby), the other brand names, were so watery, that I found myself constantly having to wipe the spoon which then gave me flash back memories of how many times I had to wipe my granddaughter's face with a spoon, the leakage, and same way with my son when he was a baby. But once I put it into my mouth, each one, there were no differences, the only differences here was that Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees State 1 Juicy Pear and Garden Greens was very tasty over the others where if I were a baby, I would want more.<br /><br />As an Adult on soft food diet, this is a huge relief - where Pears tastes like you just chomped on a fresh Pear, and Broccoli - tastes fresh like one just boiled it fork tender just for you, and Spinach tasted exactly like cooked spinach. Not acidity, no salt, pepper, or any seasoning. It's the way Mother Nature intended it to be; the Pear's own sweetness makes it all the more desirable.<br /><br />All I can say is - elaborately well done and well rounded meal.

review/summary: Side spout works better for little hands -- less squirting
review/text: I'm not sure why, but this side spout design seems to handle little hands squeezing it better than the other ones that have the spout in the top center. That in itself is enough reason for me to buy these again! Beyond that, all the ingredients are good and organic. Getting greens in babies couldn't be easier. These pouches are great for a diaper bag. It makes it much easier to pack food and take on the road. The best part is the baby loves them and enjoys feeding herself. It's far superior to jarred food. Let the baby feed themselves! Love it.

review/text: I was reluctant to try this since Most green babyfood comes back out one way or the other in my household by the babies around here. However I was surprised when this was delightedly swallowed and kept down without a frown by my nephew. He is just 6 months and this was his first solid. I expected him to spit it out period being a first offering. But he loved it and smiles now when he sees the package coming his way. I even tasted it myself and it was not half bad.

review/text: Not only does this product taste great, it is good for baby.  These are very handy to carry in a diaper bag, and can be eaten without a spoon.  Remember to keep an eye on the expiration date because their shelf life is relatively short due to the fact that they are organic.  I just rec'd this last week and it expire in July -- only 2 months. I would highly recommend this for anyone interested in organic baby food, but it is rather expensive.

I got a batch of these to try and to my surprise....he ate it! It has a great consitancy and a great taste (I like it) and you could seen the garden greens in the food.  I really like the pouches! They did not have these around when I had my daughter and make it so easy to travel with little ones (the glass jars can be heavy).  The screw on top is nice and does not leak.  A friend's son who is 1 acutally sucks the food out of the pouch! I would recommend this to everyone!

review/summary: Delicious and nutritious...yes, we tried it ourselves!
review/text: We frequently have young visitors so thought it would be nice to have some of this around but before giving it to anyone, tried it ourselves.<br /><br />The first thing you should know is this tastes really good! We had the pear and green puree and it was a nice blend between a bit of sweet but also obvious garden greens. Perfect for babies/toddlers or even elderly persons with a sensitive stomach.<br /><br />All organic, no BPH, nothing bad to worry about so you have the full confidence that what you are feeding is healthy. It comes in an odd little pouch type container with a knob that is fairly odd/new to use but quite useful once used.<br /><br />All in all - a superb baby food!

review/summary: Baby loves it!
review/text: This was the first mixed baby food I gave to my seven month old daughter and I was unsure if she was going to like it, but she loved it!  She had no hesitation in eating it and eagerly opened her mouth for more.  I loved that it was healthy and all organic.  The only two downsides were, unlike Gerber which can be kept for 2-3 days in the refrigerator, this has to be used within 24 hours of opening, and also unlike Gerber, it does not come in a container which you can feed out of.  You need to squirt the baby food into another container which you can then spoon it out of to feed your baby.  Those are two minor quibbles though, and overall I am very pleased with this food.

review/summary: Passed the baby and adult taste test. Also, best occasions to use it
review/text: I have to start off by noting that I am not a fan of packaged or jar forms of baby food. Fresh and homemade is my preference.<br /><br />But having noted that, Baby Gourmet is a winner and the major plus for us is that it is so portable and light. Each pouch is only 4.5 ounces and a pouch or two is all that is needed for even a relatively long day trip, although you'll probably want to bring along some extra snacks from the other food groups.  Depends on how long you'll be gone. Even the standard box of 12 is simple to tote along.<br /><br />Of course, any baby food has to pass the taste test and the Pear and Garden Greens was eaten eagerly, not only by a baby but a pouch was consumed by an older child (poured over some sliced bananas). So it will be  a staple for a 6 month old and a snack for the older child - when carrying along homemade food isn't possible.<br /><br />Unlike baby food in jars, young fingers can grasp the Baby Organic package, although parental supervision may be necessary to help aim the spout into the mouth. Of course, you can always squeeze the puree out of the pouch and into a bowl and serve it that way.<br /><br />Baby Gourmet doesn't need refrigeration until opened and an entire box isn't the least bit heavy. A shelf stable product is a major advantage when refrigerator space is at a premium. It always is at our home.<br /><br />Since Baby Gourmet encourages parents to taste the product, I did. It was appealing and not overly sweet. This made sense because the Pear and Garden Greens is noted to be unsweetened. I could definitely taste both vegetable and fruit flavors and to my adult taste buds it had a slightly sweet but mild flavor.<br /><br />It didn't knock my socks off but I'm not the important user here...the baby is. He loved it! We did taste test this on a friend's baby. Also a success. She plans to get more Baby Gourmet as her baby is normally a picky eater.<br /><br />What about nutrition? Each pouch has 80 calories (40 per half pouch) and hefty amounts of Vitamin A and C. The package needs to be refrigerated and thrown out after 24 hours, presumably because of the lack of preservatives. There are also no fillers or thickeners and this seems safe for those babies who are prone to allergies...no gluten, nuts, dairy, egg, lactose, etc. The packaging is BPA free. It also meets the USDA and other organizations' standards for being an organic product.<br /><br />Maybe I didn't look hard enough (and would appreciate the info if anyone else has it) but I couldn't find a recyclable symbol on the individual pouches. Does anyone know if they can be recycled? I assume the cardboard box can be recycled. I am knocking one star off because I wish the recycling info was more prominent. I'm winging it on that and not putting the pouches into our recycle container. Odd as it may seem, we have had packages of other foods which have a similar plastic feel and appearance and which ARE recyclable.<br /><br />One tip: Pay attention to the expiration date as the new box I received notes that the product expires in July - and this is May. I'm actually comforted by the fact that Baby Gourmet doesn't last for months and months because many baby foods which do have added preservatives and chemicals. The list of ingredients is relatively short: organic pear, broccoli, spinach, Vitamin C, Lemon Juice. Only the lemon juice is in concentrate form.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this product for convenience, portability, ease of storage and nutritional value. We'll still primarily make baby food used but this is a wonderful option when we can't have our own on hand.

review/summary: My Whole Family Fights For These!
review/text: Although I do prefer baby food products in jars, because I reuse them for many things, I have to say that the Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1 Juicy Pear and Garden Greens Baby Food is one that I will buy despite the lack of jars.<br /><br />The texture is just right- not too runny, not too thick, and the color is very natural- shows a lack of manipulation or alteration.  The taste is absolutely perfect.  The food is very sweet like fruit is but not artificially so.  The greens are in the perfect balance.  Not too much to be overbearing, but the pear fruit taste balances it out perfectly. It was gobbled right up!<br /><br />The container is very interesting- it is flat with that screw on top.  The top has a seal on it, and is very easy to remove, but not so much that it will come off if you have to transport it.  Once you open it, the spout is easy to get the food out of, and then if you need to re-cap it, you can do so and keep the rest until the next day.<br /><br />I doubt that this food would last that long, however. It is so delicious that it will be finished most likely.  The packet is also fairly easy to get most of the food out of too, leaving little waste.<br /><br />This food is so good that my entire family right up to Daddy kept trying to eat it all instead!  It would make a great snack for traveling even for plder kids on the go (even moms).  Just enough for an energy boost and a great little snack.<br /><br />I can not recommend this food highly enough. It truly is fantastic.

review/text: These organic pouches I believe are less sweet than others. They are on the pricier side but I got them on sale when they offered a coupon on Amazon so they were affordable. if they were not so expensive I would get more of them. I do not like that the pouch opening is on the side but I think that they are not meant to be eaten out of the pouch like the other types like earths best or plum organics which have spout on top which my daughter is use. They are also bigger pouches than most other types. My daughter is a pretty picky eater but she seemed to love them. She was hesistant at first of eating them but after a couple times she went for them when she saw them.

review/summary: Baby Gourmet Pear & Garden Greens - Great Tasting Quality Product, But Packaging Could Be Improved
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051COPH6">Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1(6 Months+) Juicy Pear and Garden Greens Baby Food, 4.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> is a great tasting product that has been well-thought out.  The product is mostly pears, and tastes that way.  But the included vegetables is enough to cut the sweetness slightly and add nutritional content.  The texture can be a little gritty.  That doesn't bother me, and it shouldn't bother the average baby.  There's enough sweetness to get them to swallow the pill, so to speak.<br /><br />The pouch is rather large, with enough for 2 portions.  But it is resealable, so you can refrigerate what is left.<br /><br />The only real disappointment I have with this product is the packaging.  The pouch has enough corners in it that it is impossible to get all the baby food out of it.  And the cap, while large, is not so big that babies can't get it into their mouths.  So I think they could improve the packaging somewhat.<br /><br />It should be noted that because these pouches have metal foil in them they can't be heated in the microwave.  You have to heat them in warm water.  That's pretty standard for this kind of product.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This is a high quality product that tastes good.  It has a limited amount of preservatives, so the shelf life is not very long.  And the packaging could be improved.  But the contents are nutritious and delicious.  I think you could do a lot worse than this.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Baby sucked it right up, relatively convenient package
review/text: We just used our first pack of this food (Pear and Garden Greens flavor) today at a lakeside picnic. Our son, who is seven months old, was launching himself towards the container and trying to grab it. So I think it's safe to say he found it palatable (I tried a bit and it was pretty decent - not very bland, and a good strong pear flavor). We liked that it contains pear, broccoli, and spinach, since it's been kind of hard o get broccoli into the kid thus far. I will say the recommended serving size on the package is small - he probably would have eaten twice what was contained in the package, not half.<br /><br />Anyway, this brand will definitely remain on our list of portable options. It was a hit.

review/summary: BPA Free, Convenient, Great taste, somewhat pricey compared to other brands.
review/text: I LOVE the convenience of these baby food pouches over bulky jars and I really appreciate the lack of concern for broken glass during the manufacturing process.  Pouches also mean there is less air within the container hence the food should remain fresher - this is a big plus in my book! At just over two dollars a pouch or a buck per serving I feel the pouches are somewhat on the pricey side however the safety, convenience, quality, nutrition, and taste makes these pouches more affordable.

review/summary: Decent food but it's the packaging that really sells it.
review/text: Well I will start out by saying that the pear is there but flavorwise it is second to the spinach. This is not terrible but will be the main reason that a child will take pause to the first taste.<br /><br />That being said it is perfectly good & depending on the mood of my guinea pig it goes down just fine.<br /><br />I like the nutritional value of this product and it is a decent serving size, but I will have to admit what I like best is the packaging. It is re-cappable, can be refrigerated and thanks to the pouch it fits in easily to narrow fridge/cabinet space and it's portability is ideal for travel, camping (toss it in the fire when empty) or for going to the sitter. And can actually be much tidier as the child can actually 'drink' from the pouch rather than mess with a spoon or bowel.<br /><br />This is a winner.

review/summary: Good flavor, ingredients, packaging...
review/text: This little packet (okay, it's not really a "little packet;" at 4.5 ounces, it's actually fairly hefty) is pretty much exactly what nature intended -  and parents that actually care about quality have been searching for.  With organic ingredients that you know exactly what they are, rather than some cocktail of chemicals, the first impression is a good one.  Each pouch has a screw-top lid that the kid can suck the contents out of...and reseal if it's not finished.  May not be the most sanitary of practices, but as long as you make sure it doesn't sit around for days before reusing, it won't be a problem.<br /><br />Then there's the flavor.  Yep, I had to try it.  It basically tastes like an "earthy" apple sauce made with pears.  Which is exactly what it should taste like, since it's made from pears and spinach (among a couple others.)  And the texture is very similar to apple sauce as well, except it's much creamier...none of the "grit" feeling.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for snacking, a meal unto itself, or mixing with other foods (oatmeal flakes) to make them more appetizing to your baby.  Good stuff!

review/summary: A Great Alternative to Homemade Baby Food!
review/text: I am a pretty crunchy mom. I tend to make all my babies food from organic fruits and vegetables. My son at one time was given baby food that was not  homemade nor organic and hated it. I'll leave that particular brands name out but even I agreed with my son that the food tasted terrible.<br /><br />I was pleased to try out Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees and was very to happy that my son enjoyed it cold or warm! These packages have been wonderful for us when he is cared for by a sitter or when we are on the go and need to bring along something for him to eat. The individual packages make preparation, meal and clean up time a breeze and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Compared to other baby food, there is a shorter lifespan but that's to be expected with a product that has no preservatives as well as no food dyes, no artificial colors or sweeteners. 100% organic ensure you are giving your baby the very best.<br /><br />The price is debatable as it does cost more than other baby foods out there. But this brand is 100% organic and it's pouch packaging makes it super easy to just throw in a diaper bag and be on your way. I would say it one hundred percent worth it for times sake and the health of your child. Plus getting this product through subscribe and save can save you money!

review/summary: Organically sweet but healthy
review/text: I ate one of these pouches so I would know what to expect from them.  Honestly, all I could taste was pear so although I believe the other ingredients mentioned are in them, they are pretty sweet, and I worry about creating a baby with a sweet tooth as a result.  There are few ingredients (good in my book - I prefer to eat nothing that has more than 5 ingredients) and they appear to be of a high quality.<br /><br />I miss the old baby food jars which seem greener to me.  If you didn't recycle the glass, you could at least save the jars for storage of small items.  The BPA-free packaging of these does make it easy to get the contents out, and the lid can be screwed back on so that the pouch can be finished later, but overall, there is a lot of trash generated from them.

review/summary: Concerns of product expiration
review/text: I was excited to try this out but disappointed to see that it was about to expire less than a month of receiving it. This is not the first product I've had problems with expiration dates through Amazon. It's been anywhere from Taco Seasoning to Dog Food. I understand that this is organic, but I received this in June and it expired this month. I also understand that it is a problem with Amazon, but since this is an Amazon review, I'm bringing it up.<br /><br />I did try it, and I have to say after trying the food, I was super disappointed that my baby wasn't going to be able to because I thought it was pretty good myself. I was honestly surprised that it wasn't bitter or gross. I loved the packing of this product but wonder if we aren't paying more because of it. The price to me seems a bit on the high side. I will say that Amazon does have the cheapest price at $23.38 (if you subscribe & save) but I see other organic food for less.

review/text: My baby absolutely loves this food! He's been eating Earth's best and Gerber purees regularly, and he will eat those just fine, but when I've given him the Baby Gourmet food, he practically wolfs it down. I've tasted it and it actually tastes pretty good! Now, my only issue with this food is how ridiculously expensive it is. We received about 10 packets for free at an event, and that's pretty much the only reason we tried them. I wish we could buy more but the price point is just a little too much.

review/summary: Baby and Mommy approved!!!
review/text: I make my daughter's baby food because my previous experience with store-bought foods (granted it was many years ago) was that they were overly processed, foul tasting, and inconvenient.  The food never tasted anything like what the label proclaimed it to be and usually tasted rather flavorless or sour, and they were only available in clunky containers that were annoying to pack or store.  This looked different so I decided to give it a try and I am glad that I did.<br /><br />First, and most important to me, the food is made of all natural and organic ingredients.  Second, I can clearly taste the vegetables and fruit in each bite, and I can identify them as greens and pear.  Third, the storage container is extremely convenient.  I don't have to worry about the package breaking open in her bag and it is easy to serve her exactly the amount I desire.<br /><br />The packaging recommends that the product be consumed within 24 hours and in my house that is no problem. My sometimes-reluctant-to-eat 6 month old had absolutely no difficulty polishing off a container in a day.  And if she did, it tastes so good that I would probably not mind finishing it off.  She loves the taste and the consistency is great for someone just starting on purees.

review/summary: The little one couldn't eat it fast enough
review/text: As we were preparing for the arrival of our 7 month old grandson, I ordered this Vine selection for him.  He is not a picky eater, but he does have some foods that he will not eat.  He gets this funny face, gags, and then spits it up.  It is quite cute actually - as the grandparent many more things are cute this time around.  So after a round of gags with a new pumpkin organic something or another, we tried this pear and garden greens food combo.  It is made up of a blend of organic pears, organic broccoli and organic spinach.  He face went from gags to smiles, his hands starting to whirl and his mouth kept opening until the packet was empty.  And I stood there with my mouth open - no, not for this concoction, but because who in the world would think that these three foods would be anything that a human would like.  But like it he did.  We fed him 7 packets in 7 days and he never tired of it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: organic fast food-not just babies
review/text: The packaging of this product makes it a quick fix for travel, a snack on the run or a day out at the park/beach etc. Easy to open, easy to squeeze and can be resealed. Just keep the cap away from babies, as it is a choke-able size. It does not have to be refrigerated unless it has been opened.<br /><br />Each squeeze pack is 2 servings, so double the amount of sugar when computing the ingredients. One serving of the Juicy Pear and Garden Greens has 9g. of carbs and less than 1g. sugar, no fat, no sodium, no protein. That is why I called it Organic fast food. It's nice for a fill in snack, but I don't think I would make it an infant's entire diet. I'm not sure if other varieties of this brand have more food value.<br /><br />I actually ordered this box of food for my grand-kids who are 5 and 6 years old. They go to boxing and Kung Fu school and are always looking for a little pick-me up in between classes. They like the taste and asked for more. I also passed some on to a 70 year old woman who attends my tai chi for seniors class. She has had a brain incident and lost her ability to swallow liquids or speak. She chokes on water and this is the perfect thing to quench her thirst without choking. We had been giving her the squeezable yogurts that kids like so much. This will add a little variety to her choice.<br /><br />It taste like sweet pears, even though there is no added sugar. The consistency is like applesauce.<br /><br />Very pricy to use for everyday meals, but I will use it as a fast food pick-me up for both the kids and seniors.

review/summary: Delicious & Nutritious / Easy to Use Great when travelling
review/text: Years ago I always made all the baby food my kids ate to ensure they only had high quality, fresh food with no additives and no preservatives.  I was very curious about this new squeeze dispense baby food, and rather skeptical as well.  The ingredients are nice & simple : Organic Pears, Organic broccoli, Organic Spinach, Ascorbic Acid & Organic Lemon Juice.  I like it so far<br />Next the taste test was not as sweet as I expected considering pears was listed first.  This is great because I don't want baby to develop a sweet tooth this early.  The flavor tends more towards the spinach than the broccoli.<br />I'm not a fan of this packaging.  The cap can easily be a choking hazard and it seems as though this pouch could easily be redesigned without it, it serves no meaningful purpose to me.  A tear strip would be much safer.<br />I tried this and like it, my nephew willingly ate it, but I don't think he was a huge fan.  Overall I like this product and would probably purchase this for travel convenience.  Amazon's price especially with the available coupons make this a very economical healthy choice.

I'm happy that I'm giving her something that actually tastes good rather than just raw, disgusting vitamin goo (which I half expected it to be). It is, of course, full of vitamins, and seems to be the perfect thing to give your baby. It's the perfect blend of nutrients and flavor to give to any growing child. I'd recommend this to any parent looking for a good baby food brand.

review/summary: Here's Another Use for Baby Gourmet...
review/text: I no longer have a baby, but I do have a preschooler who avoids eating fruits and veggies. Therefore, I look for ways to "hide" them in other foods. That's where purees come in very handy. It's hard for me to find a variety of organic produce locally, so I was glad to see this Baby Gourmet online.<br /><br />Here's what I made this morning (good for the whole family!):<br /><br />Pear and Garden Greens Protein Pancakes<br /><br />1 1/2 cups of Aunt Jemima whole wheat pancake mix<br />1 1/2 cups milk<br />1 Baby Gourmet pouch<br />1 scoop vanilla protein powder<br />1 tbsp vegetable oil<br />1 egg<br /><br />Mix 'em up, and make your pancakes (or waffles). I made the same recipe with canned pumpkin the other day and it came out great.<br /><br />The puree makes the pancakes thicker (which is why I added a little extra milk, too), and in this case, offers just a very light, nice pear flavor. Next time, I think I'll try adding two pouches-- I think it could take it.<br /><br />I think it's very handy to have small portions of purees around for just this purpose-- you can sneak them into lots of meals so your kids don't even realize they've just eaten fruits and veggies.

review/summary: A great fruit item for when you need something quick
review/text: I don't use a lot of commercial baby foods as I tend to make most of what I feed the grandchildren. However, there are times when you want to be prepared with something quick and this fit the scenerio of "the baby needs food NOW" very well.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented on the ingredients, the nutritional value etc. So I won't go into any of that. What I like about Baby Gourmet Juicy Pear and Garden Greens is the on-the-go ability. I keep a diaper bag packed in the car at all times as well as a diaper bag that I take places. This product along with several others (yogurt snacks, baby cookies, jars etc) comes in handy when you are out somewhere longer than you expected to be or if you are going on a picnic at the park or somewhere that doesn't offer baby-friendly foods--you know no apple juice or mac and cheese. The container is heavy duty in that nothing has punctured it yet, squirts well into a small bowl, and the baby likes it.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone that is a busy on-the-go mom or dad or grandparent. Because it is organic though, make sure you watch the expiration dates. And if you do keep some in the car for hunger emergencies, if any is left it needs to be stored in the refrigerator.

review/summary: Much more than food for babies
review/text: I have no more babies at home, but was curious to try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051COPH6">Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1(6 Months+) Juicy Pear and Garden Greens Baby Food, 4.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> for several reasons.  Firstly, I bake a lot and use applesauce or pureed prunes instead of oil and/or sugar in some recipes.  Secondly, my mother is unable to chew much these days, and I was thinking of sending some purees to help my folks achieve better nutrition.  Thirdly, having recently experienced some GI problems, I wanted to have pureed foods in my pantry in case I have another flare-up that necessitates a temporary change to soft foods in my diet.  Since I had relied on some pureed baby foods in the past, I liked the option of BPA free packaging that appeared to take up less storage space and the ingredient list was enticing.<br /><br />Well, the glowing praise I read about Baby Gourmet Organic foods on the web has it right!  Stage 1 foods are sold for 6 month old infants, and I wish these had been available when my daughter was young.  I would have saved so much time as I routinely pulled out the Happy Baby Food Grinder to prepare her nourishment!  I find the green vegetable flavor in this puree to be slight, not as strong as plain broccoli and spinach, with the pear sweetening it just right -- good combination for newly developing baby palates.  Now on to my experiences... I used this product in baking zucchini bread and it was outstanding!  I've frozen a couple pouches, then sliced them open for an "instant sorbet" of sorts.  It was quite good and I'm sure that if one has dental work done or is recovering from an ailment, this will be a welcome food source.  Regardless, it's a swell summer treat.<br /><br />The removable cap is small, so if you do have kids as most consumers likely do, I'd recommend taking care with its safety.  Being able to easily close the pouch is a strength, particularly since each pouch contains two servings for an infant.  The pouch should not be microwaved, but placed in hot water if warming desired.  This food has gained my approval and I'm preparing to order some for my mother.  I'll likely send <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051COPGW">Baby Gourmet Organic Yummy Combos  Stage 2 (7 Months +)  Baby's Sweet Potato Pie Baby Food, 4.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> because I think it will be a great addition to her morning oatmeal!

The pouches are no problem to toss in your cute Dooney and Bourke purse, or your already messy diaper bag, or your car or even your pocket!! What a brilliant idea.

review/summary: Pear and Broccoli-licious
review/text: As a terribly forgetful and busy mom, it never hurts to carry a few extra snacks in the car, purse, diaper bag, backpack, or in my jacket pocket.  Seriously, kids seems to be hungry ALL THE TIME.  When I got the Baby Gourmet Juicy Pear and Garden Greens baby food, I figured it wouldn't be a bad snack for my kids.  Ingredients are fairly simple:  organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinach, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and organic lemon juice concentrate.  When I tried it, I have to admit that it's not bad.  The puree tastes like pear and broccoli - it's a little sweet, but not overly so.  The texture is like Mott's Applesauce (or any other applesauce without chunks).  I didn't like it enough to finish a pouch, but my preschoolers LOVED the stuff.  At 4.5 ounces per pouch, I can't imagine giving a full pouch to a 6 month old, but this is just the right size snack for a toddler or preschooler.  In fact, Trader Joes has applesauce in a similar pouch - my kids love those things, too.<br /><br />The pouches don't require refrigeration, so I just toss them into my bag and we can go out and have a quick and healthy snack while we're out.  The cap allows for the pouch to be resealed, just in case a pouch isn't finished in one sitting.  Baby Gourmet should really consider marketing this towards preschoolers - who can go wrong with convenient AND healthy that young kids like?  Recommended!

review/summary: Packaging a plus for portability and serving size, older kids like it too!
review/text: If you're paranoid  about food allergies, you might want to stick with single ingredient baby food until your baby is perhaps 9 months old.  Otherwise there's a lot to like here.<br /><br />This review is based on our experience and those of a friend.  My wife and I tasted it and it was actually very good.  Our 4 year old wasn't keen on it but one of her close friends thought it was as good as a smoothie, and drinks it right out of the pouch, kinda like a Capri Sun, but much healthier.  I'd suggest this isn't the best way to use organic baby food.  Her little brother (7 months old) thought it was very good.<br /><br />The containers are great for portability (Won't break like glass) and resealing unused portions for later use - the glass baby food jars never close that securely.  I'd suggest these are worth it for the travel value.

review/summary: Great as a treat within a well-balanced baby diet
review/text: I agree completely with other reviewers stating that the ideal food for babies up to one year is mother's milk, which is mostly fat. That being said, like most parents we started our son trying solid foods at six months. We try to keep his diet balanced, never forgetting that his nutritional needs revolve around mother's milk, or formula if that is not available.<br /><br />As a supplement while keeping the above in mind but still getting our boy up and running with solid foods, we found this Baby Gourmet product is great. We try to keep the solids we give our son healthy, and we have turned mainly to our own cooking -- organic vegetables, potatoes and meats pureed for him at home. This is one of the few processed products we have kept on the menu. He loves it, and we can't blame him having given it a little taste ourselves.<br /><br />The packaging is great, resealable and BPA-free. The food is a nice treat (e.g. dessert in limited quantities) for baby. Recommended.

review/summary: Organic Baby Food in Convenient Packaging!
review/text: Baby Gourmet organic baby food comes in a convenient squeeze feed packaging, which allows you to use as much as you wish, as long as you use all of the package within 24 hours.  It's better than the glass jars, in my opinion.<br /><br />This particular flavor is Juicy Pear & Garden Greens, and is recommended for babies 6 months and over.  It's gluten free, with no dairy, eggs, nuts, fillers, thickeners, sweeteners or salt.<br /><br />I am disappointed that the case I received has an expiration date in two months.  So I suggest anyone who buys this item check the expiration dates on the individual packets and make sure you can use the product before the last sale date.<br /><br />This is a product I would definitely recommend and use for feeding babies ages 6 months and up.

review/text: My two-year old likes to have a pouch of apple sauce when we on the go, so we decided to try this one. First, we tried it ourselves. It tastes very much like pear puree would, but you can definitively feel the broccoli taste. It does have some grittiness as any other pear baby food, though. Our son loved it, asked for more "green apple sauce".

review/summary: Tasty and handy for a quick snack
review/text: I use these as quick snacks for my 18-month old and he enjoys them. This particular flavor took a few tries before he took to them, but after that they were great to throw in my purse and take with.<br /><br />The taste is a little tart at first and my little one had a little too much fun with the squeeze factor at first, but we soon adjusted and they've been good healthy snacks!

review/summary: Okay I guess
review/text: The kid likes this stuff.  Me, I thought it tasted pretty...well, not great.  But it isn't for me, so that doesn't matter.  Since the baby liked it, I suppose it is good stuff.<br /><br />The resealable package is useful.  The fact that no sugar or salt is added is good also.  So add that to the fact that babies like it, and I would say it's good stuff.<br /><br />It's baby food.  I can't think of any more to say about it.

review/summary: Good Stuff for Babies
review/text: Babies love it and it is made with some good ingredients.  It is very convenient to take around with the soft packaging and easy to re-close top.  Although you might be able to recycle the packaging (it does not have the RRR symbol on it) in some places not many in my area take this material.  This is a product of Canada for those that care.  As far as taste goes...  babies might like it but, I and my 4 and 5 yo tried it and it tastes pretty "interesting" in a not so good way.  Keep it for the babies who don't know any better.

review/text: These pouches are very handy, and compact.<br />The flavor or Juicy Pear & Garden Greens, does not sound like a very good flavor combination.<br />I had to taste it before feeding it to the baby...<br />I was extremely shocked, it tastes very much like pear and the texture is very smooth.<br />Tastes extremely similar to just plain pear baby food- but better and fresher tasting!<br />Ohhhh  and the baby loved it too!

review/summary: juicy pear. greens?
review/text: This baby food has very simple ingredients: no sugar added, no preservatives (lemon juice only), no coloring. It is mostly all pear however. There is very little iron (2%), that I though it should have had from spinach, and virtually no protein - again, I though broccoli would add protein to this mix. It does have 70% of vitamin C however. Taste good: not over the top sweet from the pear and not over the top tart from the lemon juice.  I really wish it would have more greens in it though.

review/summary: Nice packaging, easy to use
review/text: These Packages of organic baby food come in very convenient containers, allowing you to squeeze the amount you want into a bowl and refrigerate the rest for up to 24 hours. While I have found many uses for baby food jars over the years, it is nice that these bpa-free containers fold flat making them easy to dispose of.<br /><br />This particular variety contains pear, broccoli, and spinach. Since this is rated stage 1, for six months and older, I suppose it is ok to combine the three. However, for allergy and tolerance purposes, it is best to introduce your infant to single ingredient foods before choosing multiple variety foods.  Also, having sweeteners like the pears in with your vegetables teaches your children that sweet is necessary.<br /><br />If you are into organic and healthy, these are great to bring along in your diaper bag, however you might want to consider making your own using a blender or food processor if all natural is really important to you.

review/summary: Very tasty indeed, and organic
review/text: In order to review a baby food product one needs a baby, right?  since I do not have one and wished to participate in said review I needed to borrow one.<br />Knowing me, my good friend allowed me to test Baby Gourmet Juicy Pear & Garden Greens on her little girl. Since I am a green smoothie advocate I found it interesting to have a product that mimics this food choice.<br /><br />My first observation was that it is packaged nicely and is a very convenient way to carry your baby's food, a lot better that the bulky and oft times dangerous glass jars.<br />I opened one and actually took a swig, well if we are going to feed out babies with it, it should be good enough for me.  It was, very tasty, it was nice and thick just enough to be able to hold on a spoon and it was also very sweet so I looked at the packaging to see how much sugar was in it.<br /><br />Nutritional facts:  Per Serving:<br />Serving size 1/2 package<br />Calories 40<br />Total Fat 0<br />Sodium 0<br />Carbs 9<br />Fiber 2<br />Sugars less that 1 gr. (sugar is from the fruit and not added.)<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Organic Pear,Organic Broccoli, Organic Spinach,<br />Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) Organic Lemon Concentrate<br />Plain and simple<br /><br />Also:<br />No Fillers or Thickeners<br />Unsalted & Unsweetened<br />No Dairy, Eggs or Lactose<br />Gluten Free<br />Nut free<br />BPA Free Packaging.<br /><br />OK the nutritional part is fine now the little one.<br />Sarah is about 15 months old and very sweet child that has no big issues with food she has her likes and dislikes.  I poured some of these baby food in a bowl and started to feed her, just a little at first and she opened wide anticipating something good, when it hit her tongue she made a funny face, I hung there waiting for her approval, and I got it.<br />She liked it.  I continued and she gobbled up the whole portion.  Later her mom asked if I could let her finish the rest I brought it over and we let her "suck" it out of the tube and it was fine, the only thing is she was not able to get the entire contents, mother had to assist.<br /><br />Findings: I think this is a lovely way to feed a child with this on the go, I just hope people don't just buy it to take off the lid and hand it to the child and walk away letting the child feed itself. I do not think most mothers would do that.<br /><br />I have seen these packages with juice etc.  The babies seem to like it. The packaging is also something I would like to comment about, it stands on itself without tipping and is reseal able.<br /><br />Overall, I find this is very tasty and seems to have a good nutritional base for your child.<br />Mom says Sarah is enjoying her new tasty Baby Food.

review/summary: Better if thicker
review/text: My nephew seems to enjoy these purees.  My only comments are:<br /><br />- it is a bit watery.  If it was slightly thicker, it would make feeding much easier as it would be much easier to get it into his mouth.  To make it thicker, I blend the puree with a little banana or steamed yams to give it a thicker consistency and make it easier to eat.<br /><br />- Another note is that each pouch is so large.  The instructions indicate to use within 24 hours of opening.  In my nephew's case, he's 6 months old.  There is no way he will be able to finish a single 4.5oz pouch in 24 hrs in addition to drinking his milk.  I have had no problems with using the packs over 2-3 days.

review/summary: Not too sweet, but the little guy loves them!
review/text: Our son has been a fan of fruit/veggie pouches for a while now and these are no exception. We knew he would like them as pears are one of his favorites and he does, but I was surprised to discover that pear is not the dominant flavor. The broccoli dominates, but still he will always chooses these ones over any others (even the ones that are purely fruit). Obviously, this is great news. He has always done a good job eating his veggies, but his enjoyment of these particular pouches has still been a pleasant surprise. And best of all: they're organic!

review/summary: Tasty organic pear baby food
review/text: Baby Gourmet Juicy Pear & Garden Greens is a typical pureed baby food.  It has the appearance of honey mustard sauce in both color and texture and tastes predominately like pears with a barely detectable hint of raw broccoli flavor.  It's not overly sweet and has no added sugar.<br /><br />There is a lot of packaging involved in the handy little pouches but it is nice that it is easy to squeeze out just the amount you want to serve and then to empty out the pouch completely without having to scrape around in the corners of a jar with a tiny spoon.  It's very easy to warm up in a bowl of warm water.  Don't microwave the pouch and don't let the baby play with the cap as it's a choking hazard.<br /><br />Ingredients:  organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinach, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), organic lemon juice concentrate.<br /><br />Each pouch contains 4.5 oz. (128 g) which is two 2.25 oz. (64g) servings.<br /><br />Each 40 calorie serving has 9 g carbohydrates including 2 g dietary fiber and no fat, sodium, or protein.

review/summary: Great for on the go
review/text: I am always looking for convenient and healthy snacks for when we are on the go.  I got these and gave them to both my 2 and 4 year old.  My 4 year old was not interested (I was not surprised because she is a very picky eater).  My 2 year old, who is a better eater, drank up one and asked for another!<br /><br />I love how easy it was for my 2 year old to eat these on her own.  There was very little mess involved (she did dribble a little on her shirt) and I was surprised at how much she was able to get out on her own.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give these 5 stars is because they are a bit pricey, but I plan on having these around for special longer trips and occasions when it is harder to pack food.

review/summary: Great package design
review/text: My baby (9 months old) is usually pretty picky, preferring mostly pears, apples, and squash, and she does very much like this juicy pear and garden greens flavor, but Since every baby's taste is different, this review is more about the packaging than the flavor.  It comes in a pouch with a great little screw top that, when removed, reveals a straw sized opening for you to squeeze the food through.  This is GREAT because it allows the baby to suck the food out, thus avoiding the SUPER messy alternative spoon feeding, however, you can't simply hand it to the baby and allow her to feed herself, because as soon as they squeeze it all squirts out.  That's not a big deal, I just hold onto it as she sucks, which is still easier than spoon feeding! The package also reseals by simply screwing the top back on, so you can store it for later feedings. Another thing that's really nice (for older babies) is that the package size is a larger 4.5oz, instead of the typical 4oz glass or plastic jars made by Gerber, Beechnut, etc. The package is great for traveling as well! It takes up a lot less space than the glass or plastic containers, so it's easy to toss in a diaper bag for a quick trip or pack a lot for a longer vacation! Overall, I like them a lot and would recommend them to any parent on the go!

review/summary: Exceptional, High Quality Baby Food
review/text: Baby Gourmet really is exceptional, high quality baby food.  It is delicious too (I ate a pouch!).<br /><br />The fruit and vegetables are totally organic, which is nice, and the ingredients are pure with no fillers, sugars, starches, fats of any kind added.  Only pure organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinach, vitamin c, organic lemon juice concentrate.  You can't do much better than that.  I also appreciated the BPA free packaging.  This product is free of common allergens for baby like dairy, egg and lactose.  Gluten free as well (nice for moms for who have celiac and wonder if baby is intolerant as well).  No need to worry.  There is no gluten at all in this product, which leaves me to believe it was manufactured under gluten-safe conditions).<br /><br />Highly recommended if you're looking for a superior baby food brand.

review/summary: My infant loves these!
review/text: There's really only one measure of how good a baby food is: does your child eat it? After all, s/he isn't going to give you a detailed critique of what the stuff does to her/his palate, and while you can taste it yourself, it doesn't really matter what it tastes like to you.<br /><br />That being said, the pack of 12 purees that I got disappeared quickly, as our littlest one couldn't get enough of them. She even finished one and immediately asked for another, which doesn't usually happen with these kinds of foods. So either they are not filling (not likely) or they taste really good.<br /><br />So, you've got her endorsement--I hope your child likes these as much as mine did. I have to confess that I sampled a little, too, and it tastes pretty good.

review/summary: My picky baby loves this
review/text: Ever since I introduced fruits to my 8 month old daughter, she almost always refuses her vegetables. This  Baby Gourmet food is the perfect solution. I received the Juicy Pear and Garden Greens flavor which consists of Organic Pear, Organic Broccoli, Organic Spinach, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Organic Lemon Juice Concentrate. I tasted it before I gave it to my baby and it's surprising tasty and kind of sweet, I would have never guessed that it had spinach or broccoli in it. She ate it without a fuss and I was so relieved. She also suffers from a milk protein allergy and this baby food is dairy free. It's also free of egg, lactose, gluten and nuts. The plastic packaging is BPA-Free and very handy to throw in my purse or diaper bag, as opposed to the glass jars I usually carry around. I'm so impressed with this baby food and I highly recommend it to others.

It is a nutritious pouch of healthy foods that will teach babies good eating habits and develop a taste for healthy natural foods.<br /><br />Among this product's many good points include that you don't have to worry about high carb counts and sugar and your child is eating a balanced meal.

With Baby Gourmet Purees, you are feeding your child REAL food and not sugar or articial sweeteners or fillers.  Kudos to Baby Gourmet for their honesty in marketing and labeling.

review/summary: A tasty treat for a growing baby...
review/text: My wife and I have always been of the belief that it is best to give your children food you have personally prepared and so we tried to stay away from excessively feeding them `baby food'.  We have kept food on hand for convenience especially when we're on the go.  One thing my wife and I have found is that these Baby Gourmet pouches are certainly the better `baby food' product out there.  Sure, you're talking about pears, which are rich in natural sugars and may not be the food you want your little one gobbling down, but in my eyes it is far better than many of the processed foods parents feed their children regularly.  In fact, if you glance at the list of ingredients here you'll see organic fruits and vegetables that (shocker) actually match up to the description on the front of the pouch.  My youngest still gulps these down when we're out and about as a hold me over for dinner (yeah, these really aren't `meal' worthy, but more of a snack).  They are tasty (yes, I've tried it)...you can really taste the pear.  All in all, this is a good product that I'd recommend to parents looking for a healthier alternative to their child's snacking.

review/text: We tried these with our son when he was six months old. He loves them! The pear flavor makes them sweet and very effectively masks the vegetables. The pouches are easy to carry and are very convenient since we could squirt the puree straight into our son's mouth. Unfortunately he doesn't tolerate them very well; they make him very gassy and fussy. If it wasn't for this we would be the biggest fans of Baby Gourmet Purees because our son loves them and they are so convenient.

review/summary: Easy packaging for baby food, especially if you need to feed your little one on the go!
review/text: For starters, let me be honest that while the organic label and simple ingredients list (Organic Pear, Organic Broccoli, Organic Spinach, Ascorbic Acid, Organic Lemon Juice Concentrate) is a plus, I'm not one to seek out packaged organic products. Why? Because the "organic" label isn't clearly defined by the FDA or others, so it's hard to know what products are truthful and what aren't. That's why I usually choose to skip over anything prepackaged with an "organic" label and instead buy fresh produce from local farmers who I can check out more easily.<br /><br />However, convenience makes packaged products necessary from time to time. While some moms are able to stay on top of making their own baby food and having it packaged and ready to take with them on outings, that's not my reality. With each addition to our family, I am eager for shortcuts to make my life a little easier. This product is one of those shortcuts.<br /><br />The flavor is sweet - from the pear, ascorbic acid, and lemon juice concentrate - so I think this product could be great for breastfed babies (who are used to the sweeter taste of breastmilk as compared to formula). The convenience of these makes them handy for older kids too - once in a bind while we were out without other snacks, I gave one of these to each of my preschool-aged kiddos (ages 3 and 5), and they really liked them.<br /><br />I've seen packaged like this one with little spoons screwed on to the end where the cap was, but I keep forgetting to look for something like that at a local baby store. I don't see any online, so I'll have to ask one of the moms at church who I've seen with attached spoons. (If anyone knows what I'm talking about, PLEASE leave a comment :))

review/summary: Organic goodness, but they shouldn't be mixed
review/text: My adult daughter's review: Love the fact that it's organic, and it actually tastes pretty good (I taste-tested it for the little one). I usually make my own baby food for the first year, but with three kids and no time, I thought I'd try the Baby Gourmet organic baby food. The easy squeeze packaging is nice (though I kind of like to reuse baby food jars for sewing supplies and nails and screws, etc.). My main complaint is the mixtures they come in. I wish that the Stage 1 foods were single fruits or vegetables, not a mix of three, like this pear-spinach-broccoli combo. Pediatritions always say to introduce just one new food at a time when your baby is in Stage 1 and to check for reactions for three days before introducing another. These multi-food meals make it impossible to do that. For Stage 2 and later, it would be fine, but mixes are a pain at the 6-month mark.

I loved the unique combo of foods (pear, spinach, broccoli), the pouch packaging (great for squeezing out onto a spoon for on-the-go feeding, or just to save the trouble of washing a bowl!), and the fact that my baby devoured it. She absolutely loved it! I tried it as well, and it does taste good. It does have a predominant pear taste. Really the only negative thing about this (and the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is the astronomical price tag. I'm not sure the "organic" label warrants it being about four times as pricey as its jarred counterparts.

review/summary: Happy baby, happy mama!
review/text: My son just recently started eating baby food, all made at home. I wanted to try something that was a bit more portable and didn't require refrigeration, so when we travel it's still easy to feed. These purees definitely fit the bill. They're healthy, totally portable, easy to throw in a bag, and my son loves them. We've tried two flavors now and have enjoyed both.<br /><br />My son even feeds himself, straight from the package. He's anxious to eat it as soon as he sees the green packaging! I do remove and discard the cap immediately, as it's quite small and could pose a choking hazard.<br /><br />The serving size is great and I love that they're made with organic ingredients. I'm not thrilled with the price, which is why I knocked this down to 4 stars, rather than 5. It's a great product, but super pricy for what you get.<br /><br />I would love to see more flavors that don't include fruit as a sweetener. Veggies can be fine on their own and my son loves to nibble on the veggies I've made him at home. Fruit is great, but some plain vegetable flavors would be nice too.

review/summary: Mom and Dad say it Tastes Like Real Food and Baby Loves It!
review/text: It's about time that baby purees started tasting like real food. Not sure what happened but there's been a baby food revolution in the last 5 years <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051COPH6">Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1(6 Months+) Juicy Pear and Garden Greens Baby Food, 4.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> is one of those 'revolutionary' foods. It just tastes better than the stuff in the jars and it looks better too (bright appetizing colors).<br /><br />I hate to do this but I'm knocking one star off because I'm realizing that many of the manufacturers are starting to add pears to sweeten what would otherwise be just vegetables (and vegetables can be sweet on their own, right?) So of course it makes it taste good and babies love it but I worry that they'll have a hard time adjusting to food combinations that don't have that extra sugar kick (already happened to a niece of mine).<br /><br />So if you can make your own purees good for you but if you can't this isn't such a bad alternative and I'll definitely be buying more.

review/summary: very big kid friendly!
review/text: I got these originally planning on trying them when my youngest was ready to begin solids.  I had another month or so, but I figured they would be nice to have.  Well, he never got to try them-- my daughter (3 years) gobbled the entire box up before my son ever reached 6 months.  I never even got a chance to taste a little bit, so i don't know if my daughter enjoyed them because they taste mostly like pear or if you can taste some of the spinach, but there were no complaints from her.  I love that it was so easy for us to sneak some extra veggies into her diet, and that these pouches are so easy to take on the go-- the perfect thing to cram into our diaper bag in order to have a quick snack without worrying about crushed crackers or spoiled fruit.<br /><br />I do find it kind of interesting that the nozzle part is to the side on these foods instead of on the top like some other "squeezy food" (as we call it) products.  I guess that makes it a bit easier to squeeze onto a spoon for young babies, but it was unnecessary with my 3 year old.

review/summary: A Life Saver
review/text: We love that these are Organic. It's unfortunate that even in some formulas there are HFCS. It's unbelievable. So these pouches are great being organic and healthy.<br /><br />The true benefit though is the packaging. These are so convenient to use on the go.<br /><br />We made a trip to Disneyland, and these pouches were a life saver. In the past, we've used just a little container and a spoon to feed the baby, but it really ends up being a mess. On the trip, the baby could just snack on the food straight from the pouch with hardly any mess (we would hold the pouch so it wouldn't get messy).<br /><br />You take the green cap off and then it's perfect for the baby to just suck on it and get the baby food out.<br /><br />Highly recommended for using when you're on a trip or in a restaurant and the baby wants some food, but you don't want to create a mess.

review/text: My little one loves this baby food, and I love feeding it to him. I love organic baby food, and this puree is a great first food. Organic - so you don't have to worry about whats in it, and tasty enough that they will love it (yes, I tried it myself!) The pouches are sturdy enough to stand up to floating around the diaper bag without being punctured, and they are just the right size for a full serving. If you are feeding this along with something else the leftovers keep in the fridge just fine. Great baby food!

review/summary: Convenient,naturalm and  good way to get veggies in
review/text: These screw lid pouches are very convenient and much better than jars.  It is easy to squeeze out the amount you need, put on the cap and put back in the fridge.  The other option, for older babies, is to let them suck it straight out of the pouch, without the need for a bowl or utensils. The packaging is also more space saving, won't break, and very portable.<br /><br />I tasted the Juicy Pear and Greens (I taste anything I give my kid) and was surprised at how good it was.  The sweet pear is the dominant flavor.  The ingredients in this baby food are all real foods, with no fillers or unpronounceable additives.<br /><br />The only problem with this pouch baby food is that it is expensive.  Unfortunately this seems to be the case with all of the baby foods packaged like this (as opposed to jars).  Hopefully as more baby food brands move over to this type of packaging, the price will come down.

review/summary: A Home Run!
review/text: Tried this out on my 9 month old grandson.  The flavor here is Juicy Pear and Garden Greens.  His mother was present to confirm my evaluation. HE LOVED IT!  He gave it his flapping arms endorsement after the first bite, and gladly ate the entire serving offered - with gusto.  I tasted this myself, and it is GOOD.<br /><br />Comes in a heavy foil pouch with a screw off lid.  The lid is unusually large and there is a choke hazard warning regarding it on the package.  As I pointed out to my daughter, if it was smaller, it would be even more of a hazard (It's possibly "too large" for baby to swallow, so I believe they put some thought into the design).<br /><br />2 servings per 4.5 Oz pouch, 40 calories per serving.  Must be refrigerated after opening, with a 24 hour shelf limit at that time.  There are ZERO preservatives in this product.  Contains: organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinach, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), organic lemon juice concentrate. Nine grams of carbs, no fat and no protein. No chemicals or preservatives.<br /><br />A bit pricey, but a very healthy and very tasty addition to baby's diet.  We'll be trying the other Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Puree flavors.

I guess that when scanning product reviews of things like this you have to apply them to the preference of your kids before you plunk down money. So I'll just say that if your child is particular about organic, unsweetened fruit (and I really thought mine weren't), know what you're getting into.

review/summary: Picky eating daughter approves
review/text: My daughter has become a picky eater the last few weeks on anything with vegetables so I was pleased when she loved this.  It's green and smooth stage 1 food. She's been eating it at room temperature but it can be stored in the fridge for later.<br /><br />It does warn about the choking hazard of the cap but even so I find this packaging very convenient.  It squeezes like toothpaste and can be closed up just the same.  I've found this easier than getting food out of baby jars.  The package is portable in a baby bag.<br /><br />At a year, my daughter eats the whole package at one sitting but for a smaller child you'll use less. She seems to be trying to figure out this new source of baby food after being used to the jars.  Just be careful your child doesn't squeeze the bag or you'll probably have too much come out at once.<br /><br />So for this mom, I'm happy to see something good for my child that she likes to eat!

review/summary: Good for the older kiddos too.
review/text: My 16 month old likes this product very well.  It is the consistency of runny yogurt, so sometimes we add a bit of cereal if we want a more solidified texture - but other times we just let him eat it as is.<br /><br />The color is a light green-y yellow with brownish tones.  Not entirely pleasing to the eye but really - what baby food is?  The smell is just what you'd think - a dominant pear smell with some vegetable smell a little like green bean but hard to identify.  My husband tasted it and he said it was ok but he'd probably not want to eat a whole container of it himself.<br /><br />I like the packaging and ease of opening and dispensing.  My only concern would be package rupture if we were going to take it with us while traveling and if things got packed on top - would it be durable enough to not burst open at the seams?  I don't know the answer to this one.  Glass jars of baby food and even the plastic ones they have out now are very durable for travel and I have traveled with them with great success.  I'd probably take a little extra care with these and not pack them on the bottom of any bag.<br /><br />Bottom line though, is that I would recommend these to friends.  My child likes them and that in the end is what counts most to me.

review/text: okay, these are more expensive than jarred baby food, but they're so much more convenient. when your kid is older, s/he can suck the food out of it - try doing that with jarred food! also, with jarred food, if your kid doesn't finish the food, the rest have to be thrown away if you didn't spoon it out first. but since you squeeze the food out, the leftover can be stored for future consumption by simply putting the lid back on.<br /><br />the product is organic and promotes "green" health, but i don't want anyone to get fooled that this is healthy like a green smoothie. the first ingredient is PEAR, so it has more fruit than anything. it's yummy, probably because the product contains more pear than anything else, so i don't know how much broccoli and spinach are in there. but then less pear means it won't be as yummy for the baby. so don't think this is a good way to get more veggies into your baby - it's a fruit snack with some veggies pureed in there.<br /><br />still, a great product to tote if you don't want to puree your food.

review/text: My 8 month old son is just starting to eat solids regularly.  I try to make most of the baby food, but sometimes you need something that is easy to grab or easy to transport.  This product serves both those needs. I love that it is fruit and vegetables together (I haven't seen garden greens anywhere else) and I love that it's organic.  The lid is easily replaced when the baby is done and I don't worry about leaking at all.  The baby loves the flavor and gobbles the stuff right up.  This seems to fit easier in my purse or diaper bag than those square baby foods and it is lot more fun to use!

review/text: My 21 month old loves these served up room temperature.  There's something fun about the pouches though you have to help them squeeze the last half out and the day care doesn't allow them because the tops of the first pouch brand were a choking hazard (didn't notice anything problematic about these tops).  The ingredient list is pear first, then broccoli, then spinach (ascorbic acid and lemon juice concentrate are the only other ingredients).  Definitely tastes like pear so I wonder how much garden greens are really in there, but at least it's something...  Good for finicky young eaters of all ages.

review/text: My twins quickly gobbled this up in a relatively short time. It's a wonderful mix of vegetables and fruit that had my babies eager for me. The only issue I had was the packaging. I didn't quite understand it. Were they supposed to feed directly from the package? They didn't seem to like that, so I squeezed it out into something else to spoon feed. This was the only drawback because then it's not really portable if you have to squeeze it out prior to serving. Not to mention you are probably loosing some of that yummy goodness by not be able to get all of it out of the packaging.

The first squirt came out kind of fast and flew onto my sleeve so watch out for that. I agree with what others have said about these expiring fast. It may be due to having received it from Vine but I hope that we can use it all up in time. I'm thinking of buying other flavors from this brand in the future.

Although he hasn't quite learned to squeeze the pouch, he does like to hold it while I squeeze.<br /><br />The first try with the Juicy Pear & Garden Greens wasn't a huge success.  Baby is so-so on it and didn't really go in for more.  The 2nd and on times, though, he has eaten almost all the container in one sitting.  Since he isn't as into purees as he used to be, this is a success.<br /><br />I can see these being a good choice even as he is older and wants a quick snack he can feed himself.<br /><br />Overall, a simple way to feed baby (less mess for me to clean up) that baby enjoys!

review/summary: Tasty Product, Good Quality (My daughter agrees)
review/text: With a 3and half year old son and a baby daughter, I've seen my fair share of baby food.  Some of them have been barely palatable--bland but watery.  Some of them have been decently sweet and tasty.  Some have been simply dreadful to the point that I have had to apologize to my child for trying to make them eat any of it.  I had never before tried the pouched foods like Baby Gourmet, however, so this was a new experience in our household.<br /><br />Ever since the truly dreadful baby food incident, I make a point of tasting all new brands and flavors of baby food that come into our house.  Anything I can't stand doesn't get served to the kids.  So, when I opened the first pouch of Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees: Juicy Pear and Garden Greens I tried it out first.  Wasn't quite convinced that pear and garden greens would be a nice meld . . . and the green color didn't quite convince me.  However the taste was  sweet without being overwhelming.  It's obvious there's greenery in the puree, but the bitterness of the greens doesn't come through.  The puree itself is creamy without the kind of textures that bothered my picky eater son when he was a baby.  When I served this up to my daughter, she wolfed it down in no time, quickly eating an entire pouch and wanting more.  Now, my daughter will admittedly eat a wide range of things, but this food is clearly a favorite and she recognizes the pouches now when I get them out.<br /><br />For parents wanting quality store-bought baby food, this is a great option.  If you can't make your own food because of time constraints etc.  This one hundred percent organic babyfood has no added sugar or salt.  It's also gluten free and nut free, which makes it a good match for children with food allergies.  The pouch packaging is BPA free, which adds to the appeal.  These foods can be served hot or cold, and the screw top opening can be reapplied to close the pouch and use it later. If serving it warm, either heat the pouch up in a bowl of warm water, or remove the food from pouch before microwaving.  I do admit the pouches can be a little frustrating to empty: like squeezing out a toothpaste tube really: squeezing the last of the food out can be a bit tricky.  However, these containers pack easily and store well.  If you're not an arts and crafts inspired parent who can find endless uses for baby food containers, these might be easier to dispose of and are excellent for food on the go.  The variety is also fantastic.  I've only tried the one food, but looking over what Amazon has to offer, there are plenty of other flavors to explore.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that this baby food is not inexpensive.  It's well worth the price if you can afford it, but for the regular grocery budget, it's just not viable in our household to buy this as more than an occasional treat or travel option.  If you've the money to splurge and want to find a tasty organic baby food for your little one, I'd definitely recommend this!<br /><br />Happy Eating ^_^ Shanshad

review/summary: VERY NICE
review/text: A co-worker and I tried a packet of this gourmet, organic pureed juicy pear and garden greens before we gave it to the baby.  Honestly,  baby food never seems to taste spectacular to me.  This tasted better than most of the stuff that I'd feed my own children years ago.  Over the years, I've tasted some baby food that I immediately spit out, and never fed to our children.  This wasn't bad and, in a pinch, I'd eat it again.  I think that the price is about $1.50 a pack ... is it worthwhile to you?  The taste is better than most, in my opinion, and it was very well received by the baby who ate it and wanted more.  It's packaging is convenient.  As parents, we can put the lid on a refrigerate as needed, although lids can easily get misplaced.  Since it is shaped like many juice containers today, kids are "primed" to accept this.  The nutrients appear to be very good.  The only "downside" that I see is - "plastic" containers that'll sit in landfills for ages whereas the old glass jars would be recycled easily.  I give everything that I review a grade, and I believe that this merits an "A-".  I'd try this or one of the other flavors to see if your child likes the taste.  Review the contents first to make certain that there are no known allergies.  I highly recommend this pureed baby food (something I'd never imagined that I'd ever say before).

review/summary: Perfect to-go pack for the little ones!
review/text: What I like about it:<br />1) Can fit in even a fairly small purse, or throw several in your diaper or bike bag, and you can leave the house totally prepared for spontaneity...no worries about being home to avoid missed meals (or near a market to grab a bite)!<br /><br />2) Fairly neat as the children eat, and no super messy spills.<br /><br />3) Even toddlers love it - the one at my house declared it "Good!", though she also claimed it tasted like peppermint and pepper, so we may have to take her opinion with a grain of salt! Her younger sister is also a fan; she kept trying to shake down her sis for the rest of hers...hence, a word of caution: watch your little ones, as they may be sneaking out of their cribs at night to raid the cupboards for more...<br /><br />4) Healthy and organic.<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br />1) Hmm. Doesn't really taste THAT great to me. Oh but wait. No, I am not exactly the target demographic.<br /><br />2) Environment - each little packet contributes to the landfill debacle. On the other hand, used in moderation (road trips, bike trips, camping (?)) these are no worse than other things we consume which are not biodegradable.<br /><br />3) A little pricey, but again, we often pay a premium for the convenience of other consumables, too.<br /><br />So realistically, 4.5 stars. 4 because of the drawbacks, 5 stars for its likeability.

review/text: I got this Baby Gorumet Simple Purees for my daughter. I've just started her on solids a little while ago, so thought it would be nice for her to try something organic. She loved these! She loved the taste and how easy it was to eat. I had no problems with giving it to her. I tried the flavor too (for this review) and it's not bad at all. The smell is also okay. I would recommend this to anyone with organic feeding intentions, espically if you don't have time to make homemade! Great product!

review/text: Its hard to get our niece to eat much when she's over at our house every week.  She likes Cheerios, and that's about it.  I can't ever get her to eat fruit or vegetables.<br /><br />So thank goodness for products like the Baby Gourmet Organic Puree!<br /><br />She has gobbled one of these down each of the past three time's she's been at our house, even asking for one last time instead of Cheerios!<br /><br />The pouch is really toddler safe as well, which is a bonus. The lid goes on securely and definitely takes an adult to open, so she hasn't been able to get into them without our knowing.<br /><br />Really great treat for a toddler!

review/summary: Tastes great.....
review/text: I like to try the food I give to my kid and this taste real good. Maybe it is real good since its mostly pears but it taste great and has very little texture. It is not runny like some baby food and it is not firm either. It is almost like pudding but not smooth. My son really enjoyed this flavor so I will probably try out other flavors. The whole pouch idea is great too. I carry these in the bag and car for certain emergencies. Sometimes I forget a spoon but since its a pouch with a little nozzle it is pretty easy to get some out and feed my son that way.

review/text: What's not to love. My son loves it and it's organic. I like that they include healthy leafy greens with pear so it is palatable yet very nutritious. There is no sugar added so it's good for baby too.  No complaints and it's cheaper than many of the other organic brands that are comparable.

review/text: The only things my 8 month old daughter has not wanted to eat have been green (peas and spinach and potatos)so I was a little worried about the Pear and Garden Greens being green, but she loves to eat this! I think the pear gives it a nicer flavor, and of course I had to try it too- it was tasty! The packet is convenient and just the right size for her, and I really like it that it is organic. She will gobble up the whole packet when I feed it to her, and I will purchase this brand again.

The package is easy to carry arounn and small enough to be placed inside a diaper bag.  The cap allows you to recap so you can feed teh reamining later, not throw away the left overs.

review/summary: Pouch Baby food is fast and convenient
review/text: I am so sad that these pouch baby foods weren't around for my older two children.  I've been able to use them with my youngest, and I have to say, the convenience factor is amazing. I make a lot of my own baby foods, but they don't travel well.  With these, you don't have to worry about them breaking in your bag...or even packing a spoon.<br /><br />For flavor of these particular packages, I do like that they are a fruit and veggie combo.  More often, they are fruit only.  Pear and garden greens sounds disgusting, but actually doesn't taste too bad.  (Yes I tried it)  My daughter loved it and asks for them regularly.

review/summary: Tasty take-along for moms on the go
review/text: This is one of the best baby foods I've ever tried. I really appreciate the simple ingredient list.  Nutritionally, Vitamin A and C are the only nutrients ranked high enough to count on but calories are important for little ones too.  Having it packaged in the foil pouches makes it perfect for traveling with babies and small children.  They can eat it by sucking on the spout and the top screws back on so keep it clean and mess free when the kids are on the go. It can be warmed but room temp was the best, and straight from the fridge as a cold snack was also acceptable by the little ones. Both of my grandchildren(ages 12 mos. and 2 1/2 yrs)liked the taste and gladly ate these over the sugary applesauce squeezers that are commonly sold as snacks.  Of course I had to taste this before feeding it to the kids: the pears makes a nice base but the most dominant taste is broccoli with a greeny spinach undernote.  Each pouch has a 2 generous servings for a baby and once opened should be refrigerated.  Most of the time the kids  ate the whole pouch as a snack, the baby also ate part of one as a side dish during meals. These have become the go-to for supplementing a meal and to tuck into the diaper bag as a backup snack or to accompany a meal while dining out.  We went through 2 boxes of these in 2 weeks while on vacation.  I am ordering more today.

review/summary: Tastes good, great package design
review/text: My grandson loves this Baby Gourmet Organic baby food.  He seems to prefer it over another brand my daughter tried and we both feel good because he is not only eating healthy fruit, but broccoli and spinach as well.  The package is awesome.  It stands up well on the shelf in the pantry and in the fridge after opening.  It is easy to open and the screw top allows you to just squeeze out the amount you want to feed your baby, then replace the cap and place in the fridge.  Because you don't put a spoon into the package, there is no contamination like you get with a regular baby food jar, and the squeeze package allows you to get it all out of the package.<br /><br />The price is somewhat higher than with Gerber, but the Gerber comes in either small plastic containers that are not resealable or in glass jars that require you to either dip a spoon in to feed the baby or use a spoon to scoop some out to place in another dish.  Either way, you are putting something into the jar which increases chances of bacteria getting into the food.  With the Baby Gourmet packaging, nothing gets inside the package.<br /><br />I tasted the food and so did my daughter and we were both surprised that the greens and pears don't clash.  In fact, it tastes mostly like pears.  While I wouldn't probably put broccoli, spinach and pears together for my meals, my grandson does enjoy it.

review/summary: Baby and Mommy Favorite
review/text: I asked my nephew's wife and their 6 month old for help with this review, because I was not going to eat this at rate it!  She said,<br /><br />"This is one of the first "solid" foods my 6 month old has tried, and she absolutely loves it.  I didn't taste any myself, but my little one almost convinced me to take a bite.  She is always ready with an open mouth when this is on the spoon.  I served it at room temperature.  In general, this meal has definitely been her favorite of the veggies and fruits she has tried.<br /><br />As a mother, I love the convenient packaging.  The squeezable pouch and twist-off cap make dispensing the food very easy.  The cap on the pouch is re-sealable, which is great for storage or traveling.  This brand is less messy to open/close than other brands I have tried.  I also love that this food is 100% organic, has no fillers, and the packaging is BPA free.<br /><br />What great peace of mind to know you're feeding your baby the best!"<br /><br />Thank you Erin and Lilly!

review/text: The only reason this gets four stars and not five is because it is a little messy.  A six month old or even a year old will be able to suck and swallow this product.  The straw is short so when it pops out of their mouth it becomes a pear explosion if it is still being squeezed.  The product tastes good.  It has a flavor that tastes natural and does not feel as if there has been the toxic sweet additives that are in most products.  The resealable cap is beautiful.  It is also thick enough that you can squeeze the small remainder of the product at the bottom of the pouch onto a spoon to avoid any waste.  I would recommend buying this product.

As moms, we often try to incorporate veggies into things we are cooking to make sure our children are getting their veggies.  Like most babies, my daughter loves fruit and this tastes mostly like pear but also include broccoli and spinach.  I can feel good about feeding my daughter this because it is made with organic fruit and veggies and includes no added fillers.  I make my own baby food typically but the pouches are a wonderful option for being out or traveling.  They also include a whole ounce more than other brands which are usually 3.5 oz.  I am a fan and so is my daughter!

review/summary: Huge Hit
review/text: I thought that my 17 month old would like these purees, but I had no idea what a huge hit these would be for him! He's definitely on the older end of the children that this product is marketed towards, but he couldn't eat them fast enough! I loved them for several reasons. 1) They are all fruit/veggie products. Extremely healthy with no yucky additives. 2) They taste good. And yes, I tasted them - as did my 8, 6 and 4 year old. We all thought they were good! and 3) They gave my little guy some independence in eating so that I could prepare the rest of his food or we could wait for something to cool down. He's no quite ready for a bowl and a spoon yet, but he sure figured out how to quickly slurp this stuff down.<br /><br />I'll definitely be on the look out for these as we have upcoming trips over the summer - these will be fabulous to stash for healthy car snacks!

My 2 � year old will eat it in one; he sees his younger brother with one and wants one, too. I like that it has garden greens so he's getting vegetables and doesn't even know it!<br />-Price is comparable to other brands.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Of course these things could always be more affordable because you go through so many of them.<br /><br />Great product!

review/text: Okay, I can admit this. I occasionally, feed my dogs baby food. It was a recommendation from the vet after one had a long bout of pancreatitis and had a hard  time digesting food. After the pancreatitis, I visited a vet about a special diet for my dogs and organic fruits, vegetables and baby food along with a special food came out of the decision.<br /><br />I love that this product is organic, BPA free, and has a mix of fruits and vegetables. Surprisingly, my dogs prefer vegetables to fruit [perhaps it is only surprising because I prefer fruit?] and this is a great balance between the two. This product has a great balance of sweetness and the dogs really enjoy this food.<br /><br />Usually I will give the dogs a fruit and vegetable mix during the late afternoon for a snack. But, when I am in a hurry, this is an easy alternative that I don't feel guilty about. I can also admit that I have taken this product along with me on a long  bike ride and easily enjoyed it while riding. It was easy to open and enjoy; best of all it was healthy!

review/summary: good consistency and flavor
review/text: While making baby food is the often the preferred option, it is so convenient to have pouches of food at the ready for busy nights and days on the go.  This product is a good way to introduce little ones to healthy fruits and veggies.  The flavor is definitely more on the pear side than the garden greens, however, the sweetness may help to persuade hesitant eaters to dig in.  This product is not overly thick - definitely thicker than a broth but not thick like a smoothie.<br /><br />The product is packaged in BPA free packaging.  My packaging indicated that the product should be used by July 20, 2012.  From receipt of product to the best buy date, this would be about a five month shelf life.  Like other baby foods, it is recommended that the product be refrigerated after opening and used within 24 hours.<br /><br />This product is vegan and therefore vegetarian.  It is also gluten and nut free.  Ingredients:  organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinach, ascorbic acid, organic lemon juice concentrate.<br /><br />This product is made in Canada.

Apparently you can microwave this puree, yet it's possible it may lose some of its potency. Even if you get this product for free, like I did, you will likely end up buying it afterwards. I don't have any complaints to the product - I wish the packages would be larger, but then again, they're supposed to be for babies, not hungry adults.

review/summary: Simple Goodness
review/text: Baby Gourmet promises to bring organic goodness to baby food without added sugar, salt, dairy,eggs or nuts.  Additionally it is free of fillers, thickeners and gluten.  The packaging is BHA free but not recyclable. The food is packaged in convenient pouches with a plastic screw top.  This design makes it easy for taking one the go as well as for storing the unused portion.  (Should be refrigerated after opening) But the litmus test of any food is the flavor.<br /><br />This food can be served either warmed or cooled. (Package is not microwaable.)  I sampled it both ways.  Cold it tastes like a not very sweet apple sauce.  The greens, especially broccoli, come through more when it is heated,but are not overwhelming.  It is pureed and smooth. The taste isw very mild. My friend's two babies seemed to enjoy it both warm and cool.  I also gave some to a relative who has suffered a stroke.  She has difficulty eating and has lost her taste for veggies.  This was palatable and easy for her to swallow.  I could see giving it to ailing adults or older children as well as utilizing for babies.<br /><br />I applaud this company for using organic, healthier ingredients in baby food.  It is costly but an early investment in a baby's health is one with lifelong benefits.  The pouches are perfect for babies on the go and this is an easy way to intorduce greens into the diet.
