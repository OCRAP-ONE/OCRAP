review/summary: My new favorite tea!
review/text: This indeed is the best tea ever. I've been a big tea drinker all my life, but don't remember ever being vowed by a new brand of tea as much as this one. It smells wonderful and tastes even better.<br /><br />It's suitable for drinking in the evening as it is very mellow. For those who like strong black tea, this might not be their cup of tea. Those who appreciate subtle mellow tea will find this tea is just wonderful. It has no bitterness at all, maybe even a slight hint of sweetness (without sugar added).<br /><br />I can see myself buying a lot more of this tea in the future.

review/summary: Fragrant and Uplifting
review/text: Rishi is my favorite tea company as their quality is excellent and consistent, and most of their teas are organic and fair trade.  I started drinking white and green tea mainly for the numerous health benefits, but now it's become such an enjoyable part of my daily routine that I drink it just for that.  The Peach Blossom has a wonderful fruity fragrance and is slightly sweet.  It makes an incredibly delicious iced tea as well.  It does have elements of citrus in it, so it may not be as "peachy" as you might expect.  This makes it a bit lighter and less syrupy-sweet than it might be if the peach predominated.  This is neither good nor bad, it just depends on your personal preference.  One thing I like about Rishi is that all of their teas taste very natural...because they are natural! There are no artificial flavors or sweeteners.  I would purchase it either from Rishi Teas website, or perhaps at Whole Foods Market, as the price they have listed here on Amazon is very high.  Also, on Rishi's website you can choose from different sizes, including some samples if you want to try a variety first before buying a larger quantity.

review/text: This was one of my favorite Rishi teas..... until this year.  They removed the flavoring and now it tastes like plain white tea.  So if you like scented unflavored white tea give it a try.  I like flavored white tea so I'm not buying it anymore.  I'm now hunting around for flavored whites I like from other sellers since Rishi also discontinued the honeydew melon flavored white tea last year.  I never thought I'd have to leave Rishi tea because I loved their stuff but the day has come.  Bummer!

review/text: We've tried repellent and gas bombs but with no real success (we did kill one gopher with the gas bombs but out of 20 bombs we only got one gopher)<br /><br />I set the trap and that night got a gopher, I live in Colorado's front range and we are inundated with the little buggers, on my five acres, I have at least 4 active gophers. So one down, three to go.<br /><br />The traps are pretty easy to use, you do need to dig a hole but if you don't get rid of them your yard will be trashed so a hole here or there is no big deal.<br /><br />As a follow up we have killed all the gophers on our 5 acres (at least the active ones), we did this in 3 days. We spent 3 months trying repellents and gas bombs.

review/summary: The Gopher Eviscerator 5000
review/text: I will say up front that this works.  If you have  a gopher in your yard, this will put an end to that.  Just know that this is the end of the gopher/human relationship here.  This is where you escalate things after all attempts for a peaceful resolution have fallen through.  After all, would you play nice with a neighbor that leaves bear traps at your front door?<br /><br />Setting these takes some work, you push the center bars down until you can "hook" the back of them with the hinge portion of the setting rod.  I had to look this up since the package didn't explain that well.  Then, just wander out the the most recent mound of fresh dirt in your yard and start digging.  You should find 1, or hopefully, 2 tunnels.  Place the trap so the Gopher can't go around it and try to cover the hole, don't fill the hole just cover it with a tile or something.  The box says to move the trap after a couple of days if you don't get anything.  I suggest to actually check them every couple of hours.<br /><br />I got one within about 4 after setting the trap.  Likely good that I checked often since the trap doesn't land a killing blow.  Take a close look at the working part of the trap and the tripline.  The distance on them basically tells you that this thing will hit low on the gophers body, thus the catchy name I chose for the review.  Just try to check the trap often.  I am not a fan of gophers, but I am also not a fan of making little furballs suffer.<br /><br />Cleanup is simple, worthy foes may deserve a viking funeral.  Build a small, mole sized ship and immolate it on the water.  Or, place your foe up on a pike in the yard as a warning to others.  Just make sure you get them all before this last idea, last thing you need is an angry gopher child coming back to get you.  We have seen too many revenge movies based on the villain missing a few stragglers.<br /><br />In all, this trap does exactly what you want.  Happy hunting.

review/text: I was beginning to feel the gopher was mocking me.  I used several boxes of gopher gassers (I had used them successfully in the past few years).  and would come back to find a new mound less than a foot away from when I put the gassers.  Then I tried using a kind of box trap and the gopher shoved it full of dirt.  By this time between the gopher and me half my yard was dug up. Then I checked out youtube and found out about these traps, plus some good videos on where/how to set them.  I set the traps in the afternoon and by next morning I had the gopher.

review/summary: Just plain works
review/text: I had a running battle for years with gophers in my front yard.  This is in a suburban development in Northern California.  There is a canal and greenbelt right next to my neighborhood with a massive number of gophers so they sometimes migrate over to the houses (although they skipped several houses to choose mine!)  Over the years, I've tried: fox pee salt repellents, flooding, smoke bombs, poison, digging out their tunnels and I forget what else.  Nothing worked.<br /><br />Finally, I got two of these Sweeney's traps and two of the Victor traps.  I set two of each type in various holes that I found, baited with peanut butter.  I know the instructions say to dig into the main burrow and set the traps going in each direction, but I didn't see any way to do that without massive digging (previously, I'd dug down nearly 4 feet without finding any main burrow).  So I just dug the exit holes wide enough to fit the trap and let it spring without getting caught on the tunnel walls.  Some of them, I could just get it into the very end of the tunnel so the trap would be stuck vertically into the hole.  Others, I could dig enough out so the trap sat horizontally into the tunnel.  I used cable ties to attach it to a stake or a nail which I put in firmly on the outside of the hole.  I covered the hole with a clod of dirt, ball of newspaper or paper plate to keep the light out (if they see light, they will push a dirt plug in front of them, which will set off the trap without catching the gopher).<br /><br />Results were that I caught 2 gophers within a couple days and another within a week.  All of these were with the Sweeney traps and none with the Victor traps.  I did find that they Sweeney ones fit and sprung better in narrow tunnels than the Victor ones, which would get caught on the tunnel walls easier.  A few months later, another gopher moved in at the other end of my lawn and I put a couple Sweeney traps there (don't bother with the Victors anymore) and caught that one in about 3 days.<br /><br />So I would say that the Sweeney traps are the best way to deal with a gopher problem.  They work better than the Victor ones and trapping in general has the advantage that you know when you have caught something.  With all the poison, etc. methods, you never know whether you got them until there is the indirect evidence that there aren't new dirt piles for a while.

review/summary: Great idea but are now poorly made
review/text: These traps work and they require less excavation and knowledge to use than say the black hole. However, I have had three out of six break (the metal just broke) without even a caught gopher. I suspect these are now made in China and therefore are of poor quality. Only buy them from a place where you can return them if they break. Mine broke just because of the tension of setting them ( they were only used for one day!). Buy the more expensive brand of this type of trap which is made by McAfee.

review/text: This trap works.  Figuring out how to set the trap takes a minute or two, but once you get it set, it's easy to place in the tunnel.  Make sure you have gophers first.  Gopher tunnels are off to the sides of the mounds (not in the centers).  Tie a rope to the end because the gophers try to drag themselves deeper into their graves.  Fast and effective.

review/text: I got rid of the gopher which was in my backyard for more than 2 months in just 2 hours after setting the trap. My only concern with this trap is the nuances involved to get rid of the dead animal from the trap spikes. The spikes literally went through the gopher as if somebody had stabbed it.<br /><br />I found it gross to take out the animal from the spikes and decided to throw the trap away. If you are not squeamish about handling dead rodents, then you can reuse them. I highly recommend them and be sure to watch youtube videos on how to use them and set the trap. It helped me a lot.

review/text: If I only knew these traps worked so well I would have done it before they attacked ten of my new trees !!!<br />These traps are nasty and effective, and MADE IN USA !!!!<br />Heres how I used them;<br />1. take a shovel or rake and flatten all the mounds in your yard<br />2. wait and watch (next day )for a fresh mound (activity)<br />3. scrape the mound and look for a grass free patch, or the tunnel<br />  entrance, it will be covered in dirt, if this doesn't work just dig down<br />  a foot or so (two or three shovels full) then probe the sides of the hole with a big<br />  kitchen table spoon till you find the tunnel(s) usually there are two.<br />4. use your spoon to scrape out the tunnels to enlarge them a bit inside so the<br />  trap will fit and operate well within.<br />5. Tie your traps to a piece of chord and stake it outside the hole, then set and insert<br />  in the tunnels about a foot or so (till you can barely see it).<br /><br />I didn't cover my hole up, I was told by a friend that the gopher will come back<br />to plug the hole and get trapped, which seems to be the case. If you miss the first time<br />they will usually bury the trap so just dig it out, clean the tunnel and reset.<br />Stupid Gophers....

review/text: When we first got this product my husband was in a hurry and tried just placing it at the top of the gopher holes. 2 days passed and nothing. Then when we had time, we went out and installed them correctly, digging out the tunnel and placing it in, then reburying it with some twine attached so we didn't loose it. We left it buried for 24 hours before checking it and sure enough, we had caught the gopher. It looked like it would be pretty nasty to try and get the gopher off the trap so we just buried the whole thing. We still had another trap if needed and at this cheap price, I didn't mind.

review/text: One of the two traps was able to be set as it came out of the box. The frame wire on the other was bent out of shape and kept flexing while trying to set it.  During the 20 minutes I spent trying to set the second trap, the first one was tripped by a pocket gopher (without snagging the gopher). The wires on on the first had flexed so much after that use I was unable to get it to set again.<br /><br />I purchased a single Victor 0610 at the same time this model, but tried these first. I set the Victor in the same tunnel that the first Sweeney had been in, and caught a gopher within 10 minutes. I then replaced the second Sweeney, which had been tripped (but no gopher caught) with the Victor 0610, within twenty minutes another gopher had been snagged. I then placed the Victor in a third tunnel and again snagged a gopher within 20 minutes.<br /><br />The Sweeney's have been relegated to the tool shed, and I have ordered two more of the Victor 0610.

review/text: Pro: Effective when used properly: trapped the pest within a day of properly setting it.  Inexpensive: compared to the damage done by the pest<br /><br />Con: Not for everyone: Required some hand strength/dexterity to set the trigger and to remove the victim.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I live in a perfect location for moles and gophers to thrive, rural enough to have open fields nearby yet suburban enough to keep their natural predators (e.g. snakes, coyotes and bobcats) from effectively intervening.<br /><br />Moles invaded my pristine lawn a few years back and were caught using scissor traps.  However, a year ago, my mole trapping prowess waned as my entire landscape, not just the lawns, was ravaged.  Believing that a new generation of "smarter" moles had evolved, I stepped up my trapping regimen while I evaluated "smarter" traps.  My past moles inadvertently damaged plants but never destroyed them.  As my ornamental scrubs continued to fall prey one by one, I theorized that the culprit was perhaps a gopher, which unlike a mole eats roots, gnaws on the base of plants and chews up grass around its mounds.  A couple weeks back, as I stood on my front porch, a gopher popped out from a freshly excavated hole and stared me down with its beady eyes -- it felt like a scene from Caddyshack!<br /><br />I placed my order for these traps within the hour. Although most traps seemed lethal, these traps seemed the least invasive yet preserved proof of "habeus corpus."  I chose the Sweeneys because they could be set at the mouth of a fresh opening that the gopher would eventually backfill.  This would eschew both the guesswork of finding the ideal location as well as the unearthing the trap when checking or resetting.  I suppose the equivalent Victor traps would have sufficed.<br /><br />As soon as they arrived, I anxiously unpacked and familiarized myself with them.  When setting the Sweeneys, I found the opening diameter made by my gopher prevented the trap from being placed entirely into the hole.  Moreover, it kept the sprung trap from clearing the top of the tunnel.  This was remedied with a bit of trowel work, though.  The trap itself required some hand strength and simultaneous dexterity to set and arm.  I practiced a couple of times arming and triggering it.  The entire trap was placed inside the hole but the metallic trigger plate was purposely left visible.  The trap was tethered to a stake at the mouth of the opening in case the trapped gopher was still able to retreat back into its burrow.  This also made it easier to extract the trapped critter without digging up the entire trap.<br /><br />The next day, the trap was sprung and the gopher was done.  Removing it from the trap required a bit more manual coordination given the carcus prevented clear access to the pincers.  I inserted the shaft of a screwdriver under the gopher across the arms of the trap and stepped down on both ends leaving my hands free to extricate the deformed, lifeless body.  Even though I have had no more visible signs of gopher activity since then, I have reset the trap and placed it in a less conspicious location for peace of mind.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

review/text: The traps have already paid off.  One gopher was caught within the first 24-hours of setting the pair out.  Traps are fairly easy to set, took a youtube video to help because the instructional drawings are a bit hard to understand by pictures alone.  The only downside to this trap is the width of it.  Our gopher holes are much narrower than this trapping mechanism so it took time to widen the hole enough such that this trap would work properly when placed in the hole.

I bought it here at Amazon and set up the trap on a Friday afternoon.  I checked the next morning and one of the traps caught one!  Hopefully I only have one.  But I went ahead and reset the traps again to make sure.  I haven't seen any new mounds so I'll see what happens in the next few days.<br /><br />Setting up the trap is a little confusing on how to get it up and ready.  But this is my first time doing any traps so it could be just me.  But once you figure it out, you'd bonk yourself on the head wondering why it took you so long to set the trap.

The line went taught within 24 hours...though when I dug up the traps the gopher had chewed through the string and carried the trap deeper into his tunnel.  Next time I'm going to use some steel wire to stake them above ground.  The trap I didn't lose somewhere under my lawn ended up with a broken spring.  But no more signs of a gopher, so ultimately I was pleased with the results.

review/summary: My favorite spice
review/text: I got addicted to this stuff when I was living in Japan, and one of my big regrets about being back in the US is how hard, and how expensive, it is to lay my hands on some yuzu kosho.<br /><br />Yuzu kosho is made from the citrus fruit yuzu, which has a distinct flavor, different from a lime or lemon.  Kosho basically means "pepper", and this paste has a peppery flavor with a distinct yuzu bite.  It is soooooo good, and goes with almost everything.  It is especially good on chicken and fish, which is what I mainly use it for.  I also use it for a ranch-style dressing that is fantastic.<br /><br />This brand here is a high-quality version, rather than the ubiquitous cheap tube form you can find anywhere in Japan.  You don't use a lot of it when cooking, and a little goes a long ways, so this little jar will last awhile.  I am really glad to have a place to buy it here in the US, because frankly I don't want to go back to cooking without it!

review/summary: Really interesting flavor.  I love it.
review/text: This is a Japanese relish/flavoring, which I came across reading manga and wanted to try.  They suggested it is awesome in soup.  Gently spicy, with rather a hint of tansy ragweed flavor with major grapefruit, and citrus generally.  Such an interesting new flavor, I can't wait to try it in different things.  It has an amazing transcendental quality which I didn't expect.  Probably good with anything.  Very fun for the enterprising home chef.  To start off with, I tried it with some sweet potato.  That was yummy.  Not really sure who I bought it from.  Someone in LA.  Nicely packaged.

review/summary: I love this better than steel cut oats due to the full-body texture
review/text: I've been eating cooked oats all my life and have tried rolled, instant and steel-cut oats (McCann's, Quaker, Silver Palate, Bob's Red Mill, and Country Choice).  I fell in love with the McCann's steel-cut oats for the last 12 years. Well, last week I read a book that mentioned groats which I've never heard of before.<br /><br />Oat groats are the harvested oats in its pre-processed form before they have been steel cut.  To me each oat looks like the size of a fat grain of rice.  However, they have a  nuttier flavor because they are the full kernel and are as good for you nutritionally as steel-cut (if not slightly better)  and also lower on the glycemic index since they are unprocessed.<br /><br />These oats are my new love and once I finish the several pounds of steel-cut still in my possession, I will buy groats instead.  The only drawback to groats is that they take longer to cook.  I always steam one serving of Oatmeal in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00073HLMU">Oster 5711 Mechanical Food Steamer, White</a>.  For the steel-cut oats, I use � cup of oats to � cup of water and steam for 17 minutes.  For the groats, I use the same measurements but have to steam them for 22 minutes (5 minutes longer).  Since I can set it and forget it in my electric steamer every morning while I'm getting ready for work, the extra 5 minutes do not matter to me.  If I were cooking  them on the stove in water that would be different because then I would have to attend to them and the cooking time would probably be around 30 minutes.  (NOTE - When using this type steamer I remove the drip tray or the oats will take longer to cook.  The drip tray is not needed when I am using the rice bowl or another bowl inside the steamer bowl.)<br /><br />In summary, groats are lower on the glycemic index and have a more robust / nuttier / meaty texture due to the larger size pieces.  The only negative is the cooking time.  This is definitely my new morning oatmeal and I doubt I'll purchase steel-cut oats again.  It's also delicious with ground flax seed, fresh fruit, and skim milk.  I gave a bag of these oat groats to the same friend who turned me on to McCann's steel cut oats.  He has now become a convert as well and loves the full-body texture.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, McCann's, Quaker, and Bob's Red Mill steel-cut oats are delicious and nutty and are five-star products (except for Country Choice) as well; it's just that these groats take the taste and texture further along the taste stratosphere making it a five-star-plus product to me.

review/summary: Oats make for Healthy Horses and Healthy Men
review/text: So I bought these being a bit uncertain.  I have liked thick rolled oats for the last year - eating them almost daily. The thick rolled oats are great but the glycemic index is a bit high.  I was looking for healthier options, and learned about these Whole Groats - They are essentially the oat before it gets rolled.  It still undergoes a bit of steam (heat) processing but not anything as severe as quick oats.<br /><br />These oats are amazing.  The taste is full and the texture is not mushy like rolled oats.  I could eat these day and night.  I have found that cooking them in my "rice cooker" also an Amazon purchase...works great.  It has a built in timer.  I put these oats in at night, with water.  And in the morning the rice cooker kicks in around 6:15 and by 7am my oats are perfect.<br /><br />I dont even eat these oats with sugar anymore,  a few blueberries or banana on top....delicious.  The taste is awesome!

review/text: I have a daughter with a peanut allergy, so we're constantly on the lookout for products that she can enjoy.  Sun Cups are fantastic! What a great idea, to produce an alternative to that old standby of the peanut-butter filled chocolate cup. This product is far superior in flavor and quality to any similar product I've tried, with or without nuts etc. This is a gourmet product that stands on its own - not just an "alternative". The chocolate (especially the dark chocolate) is really as good as any gourmet chocolate I've had, including Belgian and French chocolates - in combination with the sunflower seed filling, it's just amazing. To boot, you can feel good about the socially responsible and sensitive way they're sourced and manufactured. Can't wait to see what they come up with next!

review/text: As someone with nut allergy, I was so excited to try these!  I bought three from the local health food store after finding them on Amazon.  I didn't want to commit to a whole case before trying them.<br /><br />Although the package was sealed, the chocolate in each was hard and looked like it had fat bloom.  It didn't taste like real milk chocolate (the ingredients list it as a mixture of milk and white chocolates, which explains the taste).  The filling was very dry and not creamy at all.  My husband said it wasn't like Reese's cups.<br /><br />They were fun to try, but the quality was lacking quite a bit in my opinion.  I'd rather dip a chocolate bar in Sunbutter than buy these again. Maybe it was just a bad batch, but I was quite disappointed, especially considering the price.

The dark chocolate is good, but I definitely seek out the milk.

review/text: (1)The price is much better on Del Monte's canned diced tomatoes ($13.26 for 12 cans) than on Muir Glen's canned diced tomatoes ($18.70 for 12 cans).  (2)Muir Glen's canned diced tomatoes are certified organic.  Del Monte's are not organic.  (3)As of June, 2012, Muir Glen still uses cans that have a white plastic inner lining containing Bisphenol A (BPA) for their canned diced tomatoes (but not for their canned tomato sauce).  Del Monte's inner can lining is shiny, metallic brass.  Thus, Del Monte's cans are better.  (4)The taste of Del Monte's canned diced tomatoes is good but not quite as good as the taste of Muir Glen's canned diced tomatoes.  Why?  (a)Because Muir Glen adds tomato sauce, which is thicker, while Del Monte adds tomato puree, which is thinner, to their canned diced tomatoes.  (b)Because the skin of the tomato fruit and the tough part of the tomato fruit which connects to the stem is somewhat more noticeable on the Del Monte canned diced tomatoes than on the Muir Glen canned diced tomatoes.  (5)Del Monte adds high fructose corn syrup to their canned diced tomatoes, making it too high in calories.  Muir Glen relies on the natural sugars already contained in the tomato fruit, making their canned diced tomatoes very low in calories.

review/summary: Nice, healthy snack
review/text: Wheat Thins is a nice snack for the right person. They can be eaten by themselves, or eaten with stuff on top - cheese, hummus, salami/sausage, vegetable spread, etc. The cracker itself is fairly small, so you can't put as much stuff on it as you would say, a Triscuit, but it is still a great snack, and healthy, with fairly low fat and a decent amount of fiber.

review/summary: My daily breakfast for 25 years
review/text: I first had Familia when visiting Switzerland in 1977. That's where we ate it the traditional way, soaked in milk with grated apples. In 1985 I found it again at a friend's house, and have been eating it daily since then. I just love it....sometimes I have it as a snack in the afternoon, too. Familia (no sugar) is the only breakfast food I've found that gives me a burst of energy that lasts throughout the morning. This was recently corroborated by an article I read a couple of weeks ago that said that muesli was the best breakfast food because the carbohydrates are so complex (raw oatmeal was a factor) that they break down very slowly, giving you a long energy burn. I don't eat sugar, and find that there are enough natural sugars in Familia to make it a treat for me. It sounds crazy that I've been eating it every day since 1985, but it's true, and I will continue to do so as long as they make it. Finding this at Amazon on the subscribe and save program has made it much more affordable for us -- please keep carrying it! Thank you Amazon!

review/summary: Usual Swiss Quality
review/text: As a frequent visitor to Switzerland, I have enjoyed many fine Swiss foods, including several brands of Muesli. I am particularly fond of Migros brand 'Farmer Croc,' but it is unavailable in the US. Familia is a tried and true high-quality brand I have known for many years. Food in Switzerland - with notable exceptions like yogurt - is generally 50 - 100% more costly than in the US, which fact prompts this review. Purchased as a 6-pack of 32 oz. packages, Familia is very competitive on price with many lower-quality US breakfast cereals. It is, at the same time, much more nutritious. Hint: prepare it with some pureed apple, fruit, a few tbsps. of yogurt, and milk and/or cream - cream turns it into a fabulous dessert. Sweeten to taste if you wish. Prepared fresh, it is chewy. If you prefer soft cereal, prepare it in advance and eat after an hour or so. It keeps well in the refrigerator. As the dollar has just hit new lows against the Swiss franc, you can expect a price hike of up to 20% in the near future.<br /><br />Addendum: I was wrong about the price increase. It went up by 30% in 8 months since a dollar now buys only 83 Swiss cents.

This muesli is delicious to eat (Even without yogurt or milk) and healthy so I can stock up for those long nights at work.<br />Now, if only Familia can bring my two favourite flavours - Erdbeer n Jogurt chips (Strawberry and yogurt chips) and Schokolade chips - chocolate chips - I can die a happy man :D.<br /><br />There is some truth to the reviews that muesli is flaky due to long shelf life- but I'm far too happy just getting this at a reasonable price to complain much.(0.16c/oz is better than any healthy cereals I can find here)<br />Perhaps one thing they can improve on with the package is ensuring the box can be closed again once it's open.

review/text: With disparity between the Dollar and the Euro, the price of this cereal has been rising where a lot of groceries have simply dropped it.  I was glad to find it on Amazon; actually it was pointed out to me via an e-mail to Switzerland.<br />I have been eating this cereal for over 20 years on a daily basis.  They have changed the formulation over the years a little [more oats initially]but it still the closest to true Swiss Muesli since I was introduced to it in the 1950's.<br />Only one local store comes close in price but they do not always have it.<br />***They ran out of this on Amazon and through one of their vendor it is now $72 per carton with shipping!  That's $12 a carton!  You can get it typically for under $9 in the store.  I tried a carton of the Original (Orange) formula.  Still the old price.  But it is very sweet.***

Unless you've tried this particular brand before and find it appealing, save your money and find a better reviewed variety.

I use to send my kids to school with a water bottle and 3 bags in it, they loved taking it with them and help them through thier day when not feeling well. I enjoy this tea even when I am not ill too. Ive not bought in bulk like this ad shows. I do not know this seller, I just know the product is very good.

review/summary: Wasabi Peas Good
review/text: I'm no roasted wasabi pea connoisseur, but these are very tasty to me. Just be careful not to eat too many at one time. A friend of mine ate a bunch at once, and then she started tearing up, then everyone thought she was upset about something, but she wasn't. It was just the wasabi peas. On the other hand, if you want people to think you are sad about something, say, the death of your mother-in-law, you could eat a handful of wasabi peas and start crying and everyone will think you cared about her a lot even though you really didn't like her at all.

review/text: Good buy.  I love wasabi and wasabi these coated peas are very good.  Sometimes the peas are a bit hard -- maybe not dried /roasted quite right.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: After having pup on Taste of the Wild and Solid Gold Barking at the Moon, did some research to find another premium grain-free food but at a lower price and found this.  Excellent stuff.<br /><br />My year and a half old chihuahua has been on it for a few months now and couldn't be doing any better.  Both he and our two cats (who are on Purina but steal the Epigen, which they seem to prefer, out of the dog's bowl) seem to love it. And pellet size is just right for them all, very small.<br /><br />Just purchased a second bag and will continue purchasing this. Very happy with the product and it's price!

review/text: This is the first grain free food all 4 cats like.  AND it is starch free to boot!  Looking forward to having them try the fish and the venison. My cat with EGC is 90% clear of issues and has stopped chewing on his fur/skin. We are all SO happy!

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: My cat loves it!  I think I have him convinced that these are treats and not actually 'food'.<br /><br />The pellets are a quite small.  So if you use treat-balls (as I do) try to get one with a smaller or adjustable opening.

review/summary: Be Careful!
review/text: With an enormous range of essential ingredients, including krill oil, a super-antioxidant rarely found in other pet foods, this product is ostensibly ideal for both cats and dogs. THE PROBLEM is that it contains so many NON-ORGANIC ingredients, including corn protein. Newer studies just released point to a greatly increased risk of tumors in animals that are fed corn, simply because ALL of the corn grown in the USA has been genetically modified (courtesy of one very large multi-national corporation whose name is familiar around the world.) You can't escape it. So until Wysong decides to produce an all-organic version of their Epigen WITHOUT any GMO ingredients, we won't be buying it anymore.
