review/summary: Did Kraft discontinue thsi product in 2008?
review/text: I found this in my local Good Stuff Cheap store for $2.00, but since they're pretty careless (or underhanded) with expiration dates, I contacted Kraft for information on reading the expiration code.  "08M13C8 16:07" stands for August 13, 2008.  Imagine my disgust to find it online for 3 times that price and see the identical date code!  BEWARE OF CRAPITALIST PIGS!

review/summary: Great product with great convenience factor
review/text: I found these for sale at Wal-Mart, and I would recommend getting them there unless an online price changes and happens to out do the convenience of buying local.  For 24 bottles I paid about $30.<br /><br />Onward to the product review.<br /><br />So I have been using these off and on since our baby boy was born in the hospital, where they supplemented him using this product while his mothers breast milk came in.  Today almost a month later we are still using this product.<br /><br />I have had some mixed results with this product, causing my son to have some gas, reflux, spit-ups, and rare vomiting (although not exclusively Enfamil's fault), but for the most part he seems to keep this down and enjoy it.  It also seems to mix fairly friendly with his moms breast milk, so if my boy is really hungry I can confidently give him both and not cause issue.<br /><br />If you can get around the price, reason with yourself, because let me tell you how convenient this product really is: The product comes in a ready-to-go bottle, and all you have to do is attach a screw-on nipple.  This is perfect for when you are up at 3AM feeding your baby (when you are tired as hell) and you have no breast milk around, or when you're out and about and you just want to quickly feed your baby.<br /><br />I have had great success using this product with my son versus using another powdered make-it-yourself product, wherein my baby was much more pleased to drink and digest this product from the latter.<br /><br />The shelf life is pretty good because you can keep this bottle out at room temperature for an hour, and store it in the refrigerator for about 2 hours or so.  Honestly, that's great because it is often the case that your baby is going to drink the entire bottle or close to it when you start your feeding anyway.<br /><br />So although the price is not as cheap as some others... the convenience factor, paired with the amount per bottle for a feeding, really makes this product worth it.  This is the only formula product I buy my son at the moment, and it seems to be working quite well.

review/summary: Can't make them this good at home!!
review/text: I'm very particular about what I feed my dogs. I often make my own "canned/wet" food and treats at home to ensure the quality and safety of the food I'm feeding my dogs. After looking at the ingredients in these biscuits and checking out the price when purchased in the 12 pound box, I realized I could not make biscuits of this quality at home for this price. My dogs really love these biscuits, and I feel good about the quality of this product. I also love that I can divide these biscuits into various sizes, as I have dogs that range from 6 lbs to 130 lbs. Even with 5 dogs this 12 lb box lasts a long time, and it is packaged in 3 heavy zipper bags, so you don't open all 12 lbs at once and they stay fresh. I would recommend these to anyone who cares about what they feed their dogs.

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE These Biscuits
review/text: I have known for a long time that Canidae is a great product, and is not usually sold in stores, so when I saw these biscuits on the Amazon website, I immediately ordered them.  I have two Eskies (miniature American Eskimo Dogs) so I had to have enough for both of them.  This is a big package, so it was definitely enough.  Canidae is so highly rated for both dry and "wet" food that I didn't have to worry about these biscuits containing anything that might not be good for my Girls.<br /><br />It has "Balanced Omega 6 & 3 Fatty Acids" and they are advertised to help control tartar and plaque.  Can't speak to that yet (neither has had a dental for a year) but I do know they love them.  It's a single biscuit that can be snapped into 4 separate pieces.  My Girls, both under 26 pounds, receive 2 half-pieces in the mid-afternoon (that's 1 biscuit broken into 2 pieces) and although one of them trots off with her half-piece as soon as she gets it, the other stands right where she is and crunches down the first half-piece and looks for the next one (just about demands it!).<br /><br />As the package ran low I knew I had to have more for them, and so re-ordered from Amazon.  Another package duly arrived, before the first one ran out, for which I was thankful.  And so were The Girls!

review/text: The Canidae Dog Treats, Lamb and Rice flavor, is the best treats for my dogs.  I have been feeding these treats to my dogs for years, and they are still the best.  They are snap biscuits so I can regulate how much I give them at a time, and guard against weight gain.  I use the Lamb and Rice because one of my dogs has an allegery to chicken and wheat.  I have never had a problem with Canidae Dog Treats, as they are healthy and safe to feed my dogs. I have been feeding the Canidae Dog Treats for well over 20 years and I plan on continuing to do so as long as I can still get the 12 pound box, as I have Big Boys to feed.

review/summary: Canidae Dog Treats
review/text: The Canidae dog treats has been well received by my 1 year old Presa Canarios.  The "snap" configuration of the treat works great since you can break off as much or as little as you want.  I liked the nutritional content of the treats.  So many times the dogs may love the treats but they are not the healthiest for them.  These treats are good for them and they love them.....  I have switched my dogs to the Canidae dog food as well.....

I feed them the same formula Canidae kibble and canned food, so these treats fit in well with their diet - no worry about upset tummies.  They smell kind of nice too, almost like cinnamon.  There is usually a good amount of crumbs at the bottom of the bag which I just sprinkle in their food bowls at dinner time.  I'll continue to buy these for my dogs for as long as they make them.

review/text: I have fed Canidae All Life Stages food for several years to my mixed dog collection, with great results, but for some reason, had not offered the Snap Biscuits.  Finally, I purchased a bag and offered them up.  Well, they must taste treat-like because they gobble them up, and have evidenced no digestive upsets.  Safe and tasty is the verdict.  My test group is aged two years through 10 years, size eight to twenty-five pounds, in generally good health.

review/summary: Great Value, A Little Broken Up
review/text: I was looking for a bulk price bargain on my preferred premium dog biscuit for my two Vizslas & this definitely met that criteria. Canidae's Snap Biscuits always have some bits and pieces in the bottom of the bag, which is understandable since the biscuit is a snap variety. I was afraid the larger quantity might mean more waste & I was right. There were three (3) plastic 4# bags in a large single cardboard box to comprise the 12#, so they must shuffle a bit & in the end the amount of tiny bits & powdery crumbs in the bottom of each bag was a significant amount of waste. Though I'm sure I could use the wasted crumbs in their food bowl, I am very careful to watch their food intake at meal time.<br /><br />I love the nutrition & quality of Canidae's Lamb & Brown Rice Snap Biscuits, but I will likely stick with the single 4# units in the future, which are packed in individual bags.

review/summary: Dog did not like them
review/text: I decided to try these treats because the reviews were so good and the price was great. That and the fact it is such a well known brand I had high expectations.  I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that I thought would love them, however he rates it a 2 star. I was hoping he would be a little more excited about them. They are a larger treat so I break them up into smaller pieces. They also have good things in them.  Most of the time he will eat the treat. Others times he will take it and then drop it in the living room and come back to it later. I will not be getting them again.

review/summary: Great natural product to clean the liver
review/text: I have always deposited a lot of faith in natural remedies, mainly because they work. A sour orange, boiled which water is drank in the mornings for seven consecutive days... or boldo leaves are my best option. And this brand has great fresh boldo leaves that clean my system in a most natural way. The tea bags are very well presented, they taste like old teas (grandma style) and I recommend this brand for selling what is a great product and even if boldo doesn't taste great, that's how it must be, with its own way to clean bile and a fat liver. I have bought other brands and at times they are almost tasteless. This one is pure and natural. A great remedy through a most healing mother nature. Thanks.

review/summary: Excellent for gallbladder symptoms
review/text: If you have gall bladder symptoms this is a traditional South American herbal tea that can help. Some people have no gall stones and yet they have right quadrant abdominal pain. (One possible cause is a Candida infected Sphincter of Odi.Yes there is such a valve, just Google it!) Taken between meals two or three times a day for about two weeks should do the trick. Also see my review of Natures Way Primadopholis. I have not heard of any side effects from this tea, other than it's unusual natural taste. Of course if you have severe pain in the gall bladder area you should be checked by a doctor as an inflamed gall bladder could burst. And you should have a scan to see if you have gall stones. I have found this tea to be very effective using it in 2004 and 2012. Salud!

review/summary: Didn't last 6 minutes
review/text: I purchased this product as an alternative to a rawhide. Our 5 month old German Shorthair Pointer puppy ate it in a matter of 6 minutes or less. She loved it, but it was more of an expensive treat.<br /><br />With a puppy, I needed something to satisfy her chewing urge. The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs.

review/summary: Safer than rawhide, don't last as long but also cleans teeth
review/text: I picked these up from my local pet shop for a bit cheaper than what they are on offer for from Amazon, so you might wish to shop around.<br /><br />Over all I am quite satisfied with these "bones." They are much safer than raw hide chews given they are made from dried chicken, which means unlike raw hide you know these are actually digestible. This is the biggest reason I bought them. My vet recommended not giving my Sheltie raw hide as they aren't properly digestible. Whether this is true or not, I've heeded her advice.<br /><br />Baird, my Sheltie, really seems to enjoy them. When he sees one coming out of the bag, his tail is wagging like crazy. He enjoys these as much as our old family Sheltie McGyver enjoyed raw hide. The only difference I see between these and raw hide is that raw hide lasted roughly 30 minutes longer in chew time than these. I'd say Baird can chew through one of these in about 30 or so minutes, while our old Sheltie could chew on a single raw hide for an hour, at which point we would throw away the little nub. There is nothing left of these bones after 30 minutes.<br /><br />As far as the dental application goes, it does smell of mint, so I assume it should, if nothing else, help with doggy breath, though to be fair Baird has never really had "doggy breath." I also use some dog mouth foam so I don't know what really keeps his breath "fresh" between the two.<br /><br />If you aren't too sure about raw hide for your dog and want something you know can be digested, these are definitely worth it.<br /><br />For those that try to keep track of where the things they give their dog come from, these are made in China. I've tried finding something similar not made in China, but it seems such a thing doesn't exist or I just can't find them.

review/summary: A Pleasant Surprise.
review/text: Celestial Seasonings Roastaroma tea has a intensely coffe-like aroma.  There is a distinctive flavour, which hints at something like coffee.  There is a somewhat bitter aftertaste if steeped too long.<br /><br />I am a Mormon and do not drink coffe or black/green tea.  I enjoyed coffee for years...quite the coffee lover as any of my family and friends would agree.  Giving it up was a hardship and I truly missed the flavour.<br /><br />Herbal teas are nice, but get old in a hurry and they need a bit of sweetening to really taste good.  Roastaroma can take a bit of sweetener, if that's how you liked your coffee.  I always use cream alone and it mellows the roastaroma nicely into an enjoyable cup.<br /><br />Overall a good product. Only drawback is it is nearly impossible to find at your local grocer.  Buying the product online requires the additional shipping and handling fees which really make the product quite expensive.

Steeping it in mik is precisely what ended up making it taste like coffee.<br /><br />I was then unable to quit making cups for myself! I've gone through boxes so quickly, I know that I will have to start buying this product in bulk.<br /><br />Using water, you get black water with a faint hint of cinamon and other spices.

Another drink I would compare it to is a black stout beer (not Guiness, something darker).  I can't wait to try it with milk.  It's bold, dark, has a nice roast flavor, and is not sweet.

Of coarse I did add my favorite creamer Coffee Mate Belgian Chocolate Toffee and a little Hazelnut stevia to it that made it so yummy. It wasn't weak like some teas can be when you're use to a bold cup of coffee. I believe I've finally found the coffee substitute that I will be able to use to stop drinking coffee and save a little money not going to Starbucks all the time. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to have a great substitute for a good cup of coffee. Celestial Seasonings out did themselves with this incredible coffee substitute.

review/summary: an all time favorite
review/text: One of my all time favorite hot beverages. Rich flavor that can be enhanced with creamer and sweetener as one would with coffee. I often serve it at dinner parties and get raving reviews and new converts. Some have said they like the taste better than coffee.<br /><br />Natural food stores usually carry this. I suspect grocery stores will catch on soon as they are increasing their healthy choices to meet population demand. If they get enough requests, they'll add it to their herbal tea section.<br /><br />This is one I try to keep in my personal stock at all times.

review/summary: Kicking coffee was easy!
review/text: Ive been trying to give up coffee, even decaf (sad face) for years but I always go back to it because finding a decent "coffee substitute" that gives that same warming comfort and mouthfeel is impossible.. you coffee drinkers know what I'm talking about.  I ran across roastaroma by accident and decided to give it a try.  The first cup wasnt bad! I actually loved it.  The cinnamon and anise are perfectly blended and you get that coffee-like aroma from the chocolate and chicory as well.  But I played around with it a little to perfect it to my taste and now I use 2 tea bags and steap for 5 minutes (I like a richer, bolder taste) and add my regular vanilla coffee creamer to it.  The creamer has just enough sweetness so that nothing else is needed.  As long as I can get this tea I'll be able to quit the coffee, it's just that good.

review/summary: Perfection in a cup
review/text: Landsakes, where has this tea been all my life?  I stumbled upon this tea at my local healthfood store just the other day and I had never heard of it before.  I am nursing at the moment and love coffee and tea.  However, I'm trying to stay away from caffeine and I know that decaf is not always healthy/tasting as good.  So I decided to try this.  Wow, its so delicious.  This tea actually does taste like coffee alot and smells great. This tea is very full bodied and tastes great with cream and honey if you want a delicious treat.

review/summary: He likes them, but I don't think he loves them...
review/text: To be fair, our dog is spoiled.  He gets treats regularly.  Among his favorites are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007A0AP8">Zuke's Jerky Naturals Dog Treats, Lamb, 6-Ounce</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews</a>.<br /><br />I thought I would try out the Wellness treats because we just switched him to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HYB2P0">Wellness Super5Mix Dry Dog Food, Small Breed Adult Health Recipe, 12-Pound Bag</a> and he LOVES it.  Before that, he was on Science Diet.  While he does like these treats, I have seen him snub away from them before.  He will, however, never snub away from a Zuke's.<br /><br />I will say that the Zuke's are more potent so maybe that's why he's drawn more to them.  The Wellness WellBites are a good product though.  The ingredients seem to be good and Wellness brand is recommended by our vet.<br /><br />I think we're going to stick with the Zuke's.  He likes them more and they're cheaper.  I would suggest trying both out for your pet, that's what we did.  There isn't too much of a price difference so it's worth a shot.<br /><br />I knocked one star off because he does not love them as much as the Zuke's.  I will probably try another flavor out in the future though to see if he likes those.

I first tried their wax paper tubes that were about 8 inches long when I was about 7 or 8 years old. Goes to figure that my 8 year old is nuts about these. We used to take our change to the local conveniance store. They came in grape, cherry, and orange, lime and other fruit flavors. Those were very good. But these are the big 21 inch thick plasitc tubes that hold the equivelant of 20 of the paper ones. This offer gets you a case of 50 of the big plastic tubes, in grape, maui punch, cherry, and orange flavors. Lots of fun from the Wonka factory.

review/summary: quite good!
review/text: I was really surprised by the good taste of this mix. The only downside is that it is grainy- at least, it is for me, but I simply dump a packet in water and stir it in. Perhaps using a blender and adding ice would lessen the graininess of it, but I bought it in the individual packets for the on-the-go convenience. I make green juice or green smoothies nearly daily, so I'm quite used to a much "greener" taste than this provides- this is actually quite sweet and I consider it a treat! I'm going to reorder this and keep it on hand.

review/summary: Create Your Own Favorite Dressing
review/text: Had a bit of a time finding this product locally, but was finally successful. It was a bit less expensive than ordering online, but the frustration of trying to find it... I would have been better off to order it online. I LOVE the taste of the product which helps me to eat more raw vegetables and salads. I hate hate hate making salads at home (though I will eat them at restaurants), but the taste of the Good Seasons dressing is a motivator. Raw carrots, cucumber slices, sliced Heirloom or grape tomatoes, lightly steamed broccoli - I'll eat them as long as I have my Good Seasons dressing to dip them into. I also use it as a marinade for chicken and turkey breasts to keep them moist and give them much needed flavor.

review/summary: New flavor of rice mix ~ Coconut Raisin Rice
review/text: This rice is what I like ~ whole grain brown rice with a hint of coconut, and the best part is there is no artificial ingredients in it ! That makes it one hell of a healthy meal.<br /><br />I saw the recipe on the back of the box for coconut shrimp rice. Although I did not follow exactly the recipe, I added sauteed shrimps with mushrooms & peas plus a splash of lime juice. Then I experimented by splashing lime juice over the cooked rice and it taste fabulous !<br /><br />However, I wanted to point out the cooking time seems to take more than 25 mins than what it said on the box....it took me 35 mins to cook the rice and I added exactly 2.5 cups of water as per instructions. After all, I am very happy I bought the rice and will continue to do so and bring something different to my dinner table.

review/summary: This is what I've been looking for!
review/text: It seems like all I ever drink is water and I know I STILL don't drink enough. It's just so boring after awhile. I've been trying to find a water I would be able to drink more of every day without missing Gatorade.<br />I tried vitamin water but it's made with so much sugar and the zero version has stevia in it which has the WORST aftertaste IMO. I looked into a few different drinks and then I found this. No sugar. Nothing artificial, just water and flavor--actually a bit more than a hint.<br />I've tried many of the flavors and, I'm sure some people would disagree with me but these are my thoughts on them:<br /><br />This flavor (pomegranate/tangerine)-- really nice. Refreshing. I drank it during a hard work out and it tasted clean. I actually finished it halfway through the work out (a first for me) and wanted more. ordering a case right now.<br /><br />Blackberry -- really nice. A teeny bit sweet but Not overly so.<br /><br />Hibiscus/honeydew -- CLOYINGLY sweet. I actually double checked the label to make sure there really was no sugar in it.<br /><br />Watermelon -- not as sweet as honeydew but still a little too sweet for everyday drinking for me.<br /><br />Cucumber -- if it's really cold, it can be somewhat refreshing in a spa kind of way. But mostly I had to pretend it didn't taste like water filtered through grass.<br /><br />Strawberry/kiwi and grapefruit-- blech. Not my favorite flavors in anything so I'm not a good judge.<br /><br />Pom/tangerine and blackberry were best IMO and now I'm trying lime too.<br />Really like this product. Hopefully there won't be some upcoming expos&eacute; about how the "natural flavors" cause cancer or something (as seems to happen with many things I like) lol<br /><br />UPDATE: tried the lime...UGH!!! Tastes like there's something wrong with it. Almost chemical flavor but not. Weird. I hated it and I wasn't the only one.

review/text: As I have said in other reviews, I normally hate flavored water. Hint is just the right amount of flavor to give water a delicious edge.<br />It has the added benefit of satisfying a craving for something sweet without going to soda or candy.<br /><br />The water is a much healthier alternative to other forms of flavor indulgence.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Pomegranate-Tangerine flavor. I think it is their best flavor.

As everyone knows, we're all being harped upon to drink more water,  Something most people are remiss in doing,  I drink a fair  amount, more than most, I bet,  However, this line of hinted waters makes it a whole lot easier.  It stymies me HOW they do it,  With no chemicals, no added weird and noxious things,  Best maybe they keep the secret to themselves,  Try it, you'll like it,

It very much had that orange oil, bitter taste.<br />I won't be buying this flavor again.

review/summary: Refreshing delicious way to get your water
review/text: I've become a fan of Hint water over the last year and tried a couple of the flavors.  I like the Pomegranate-Tangerine but am also partial to the Grapefruit flavor.  It's more of a personal preference than anything else so if you know you like these flavors, chances are you'll find these waters delicious.<br /><br />I enjoy how these taste when chilled.  I have also drank them at the gym a little less cold and find it is much better when straight from the refrigerator since the flavors are more strong.  As the name implies, it is just a hint of flavor, not meant to taste overly sweet or like a juice.  I prefer this, but some people might find the flavor not intense enough for their liking.<br /><br />Purchasing these on Amazon is so helpful since you can order in bulk and get a great deal and not have to carry or transport a heavy case home.

review/summary: Was Not Impressed
review/text: I seldom if ever give a negative review, but to put it bluntly, this stuff was bad. I tried this product based on its label of "Premium Essence Water", and the flavor sounded good too (Pomegranate-Tangerine). The first thing I noticed before opening the bottle was the amount of debris/particles/sediment floating inside the water while the sun was reflected into the bottle. I decided to still go ahead and try it and was quite unimpressed. The water had a flavor of industrial tap water, the kind you get in a large city, that is processed at the water plant nestled next to the sewer plant. There was a 'hint' of some flavor, though I couldn't pinpoint it. I gave the high 2-star rating because it would probably still be effective at dousing a fire.

review/text: I received a sample of this from the San Francisco Vegetarian Society's table during the 40th IVU conference.  Each packet has individually gold foil wrapped bouillon cubes which gets big points for keeping the cubes sanitary and safe.  I decided to try it as a cup of soup.  It took a little bit of stirring because the cubes are pretty solid.  The wait was worth it because the soup/broth was delicious and tastes so much like homemade chicken soup.  I love how I can have the flavor with out the saturated fats and cholesterol.  I can hardly wait to try the beef and veg cubes.  I will be using this in my cooking also but I love how I can have a nice warm cup of soup whenever I want now...guilt free!

review/text: This is soy sauce, people. It's black and salty; and it's in pretty much every Asian dish there is.<br /><br />At least for Japanese people, Kikkoman is the gold standard. It's hard to describe what soy sauce is supposed to taste like, but Kikkoman is it. No funny after taste... no tinny flavor like some of those other cheap-o brands.<br /><br />The only time I would even think of using anything other than Kikkoman is when I'm cooking something that wouldn't do well with the addition of liquid (e.g. stir fried veggies. Extra liquid makes them soggy.) At those times, and only at those times, I use condensed soy sauce; which Kikkoman apparently doesn't make.

I save a small fortune every year by making my lattes at home.<br /><br />That being said, the Nespresso capsule offers posted here are from a third party who is putting a large additional margin on their price.<br /><br />You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $0.55 each (half the price here).
