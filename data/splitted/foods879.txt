review/summary: good product but mostly fat calories
review/text: There are a good product and nice size, they are quite oily, but that is just due to the high nut content and nuts are high in fat.  They taste good but I tired of them quickly.  I think the ingredients are high quality and as long as you are expecting the nutritional content of these being mostly fat, they are a "healthy fat" then these are a good product and something you can't find easily elsewhere.

review/summary: Not as good as other EB food
review/text: My 7-month old son liked it but... some jars were better than others. I'm not sure why but some of them had a very thick consistency and I just had to throw them away. I started my son on solids when he turned 5 months and EB is the only food he's had. We are generally very happy with them and had this issue with this and one other flavor only. EB also makes Beef & Spinach dinner and we liked that one better.

Helpful hint ' you might want to save two large used glass jars before they arrive, so you can put olives in them. remember to add a little more water to top them off. The olive mixture is just right. (not salty). All I can say is enjoy.

review/summary: Going, going, gone! We thought there would be too many.....
review/text: We love the Byzatine Country Olives, 5-Pound Unit but admit that we love the Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto, 5-Pound Unit even more. Because I'm not usually fond of too much rosemary, I doubted that I'd like these as much, but I was oh so wrong! The assorted olives, garlic and red peppers are heightened by the large caperberries which I've rinsed off and deposited into a martini on occasion. This is a lovely assortment of Greek olives, each having its own unique texture and taste. If you are an olive lover, I think you'll enjoy this selection which arrives in a vacuum sealed package inside a cardboard box. As soon as I open a bag, I transfer the olives into very clean jars and share them with friends. I also add olive oil in some of the jars because there's not much liquid surrounding the olives. I also keep a jar for the mixologist to use, free of added oil.

review/text: If you don't like olives, don't buy this.  If you don't like the finer things in life, don't buy this.  I have to say I was skeptical given the rosemary, but this blend made me realize that it was when rosemary was used too much that I didn't like it.<br /><br />I first purchased the country blend by the same folks and it was awesome as well.  You can't lose with either, but this mix is something I know I'll be enjoying for at least a month.  I suppose I have an unhealthy relationship with olives, but it's hard not to when they are this good.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and try these out.  Oh, and don't listen to everyone else...don't share.  You can eat them all, trust me.

review/summary: Olives, Olives, Olives
review/text: Delicious and a good value.<br /><br />WHAT IT IS<br />I was at first put off by the description "antipasta".  I've purchased Spanish mixes which were mostly pearl onions and tiny cucumbers---tasty, but not cost-effective for the olives.  I've purchased "Mediterranean" mixes which were bare edible because the flavor was dominated by hot peppers and garlic.  However, this "mix" is almost entirely olives, with some tasty capers, a few garlic cloves, a few slices of bell pepper and some spices.  It is flavorful, but the mild flavoring does not overwhelm the taste of the olives.<br /><br />COMPARISION TO "BYZANTINE COUNTRY OLIVE MIX<br />The similar "Byzantine Country Olive Mix"  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAPLS6">Byzantine Country Olive Mix, 5-Pound Bag</a> is about the same product without the capers, garlic, and bell peppers, and larger ratio of green olives (about 50% green with the BCOM, 40% green with the BFOA).  Although I like the green olives better, I like the flavor of the "Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto" better, so the choice is is a close call.  (I have subscriptions for both, on alternating months).<br /><br />PACKAGING<br />The packaging (into a heavy plastic bag) apparently consisted of draining the olives and then coating them with olive oil.  Amazon packages the bag (folded in half) in a standard ca 3" x 8" x 12" cardboard box.  The first order I placed (about 9 months ago) arrived with some of the softer olives a bit mashed, but Amazon has been improving packaging.  The plastic bag is now wrapped in large bubble-wrap packaged in a box which is packaged in a larger box.  The improved packaging greatly reduces damage to solf olives.<br /><br />REPACKAGING<br />The olives are very salty, saltier than the "Byzantine Country Olive Mix".  You may be tempted to soak them in plain water to reduce the salt content.  Unless you plan to eat the olives in the next few hours, resist the temptation.  First, you'll leach out too much salt and flavor.  Second, the olives will rot in a few weeks.  Really.<br /><br />MAKING YOUR OWN BRINE<br />I suggest gently but thoroughly rinsing the olives when you receive them, ideally in a bowl of warm-hot water (to cut the excess olive oil).  Then drain and repackage them in your own light brine and white vinegar mix in your own jars, and refrigerate.  The light brine will reduce the saltiness of the olives to an appropriate level in a day or two.  It will take about 5 cups of water, about 1/4 cup (4 tbsp) of salt, and 1/3 cup (6 tbsp) of white vinegar to your taste.  Some people like olives salty, some like them vinegary, so adjust to your preferance.  It is best to use "sea-salt" or pickling salt (if you have any handy), because brine made from regular processed salt can get cloudy.<br /><br />EVALUATION<br />Some of the olives are firm, some are soft---that's simply the nature of a true mix. Most Americans (like myself), raised on pimento-stuffed queen olives think that they don't like soft olives.  Indeed, mushy queen olives are yucky.  However, some types of olives are meant to be soft, and are best soft.  It is an acquired taste, worth acquiring.  The mix includes a large variety of olives, both firm and soft.  It is said that the key to oriental cuisine is variety---a variety of colors, textures, and flavors.  The same is true of an olive mix meant for snacking or as the basis of a light meal.<br /><br />If you eat olives regularly, Amazon's subscription service is worth considering.  I'm signed up for monthly shipments and have recieved 3 shipments so far, with no problems.<br /><br />ADDITIONS<br />The bell peppers go so well that I often slice up another red bell pepper and add it to the mix.  I also often add Cerignola and Queen olives to the mix to increase the variety.  I've never seen "American style" ripe olives in any European olive product (although they probably exist).  What Americans call "black olives" (more accurately ripe ripe olives) are entirely different from the black and brown olives in this mix.  American-style ripe olives (black or green)(both are Queen olives allowed to ripen, but in different ways) are a nice addition to the mix, but are preserved in brine only and so, are best mixed when served for a greater contrast of flavors.  Ripe black olives are found in almost any American grocery.  Ripe green olives (see below) are hard to find outside California.  Unpitted are always more flavorful.  I'm not a great fan of Kalamatra olives (also brine-only olives), but a few are a nice addition to a mix.<br /><br />Recommendation 1:  A half-can of chick-peas, a diced tomato, a half-cup of these mixed olives, all mixed together with a little olive oil is a wonderful, tasty, health, lunch.  Alternatively, I often eat these with a dish of mixed nuts, diced cheeze squares, and apple slices.<br /><br />Recommendation 2:  There is a whole world of olives out their worth exploring.  As just example, Grabers Ripe Green Olives are more different from stuffed queen olives than you can imagine, but are marvelous.  Mild and nutty.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P8HPCI">Graber Olives Size 14 7.5 oz. Can</a>

review/summary: Really didn't like this product - disappointing
review/text: After reading all the hype in the reviews I had great expectations.  I'm practically an olive addict, able to plow through nearly a pound in a sitting, but I've been pushing myself for the last few weeks to finish these. That big unsealable bag is staring me in the face every time I open the fridge door.<br /><br />Save the caper berries, which I wasn't crazy about either (though I LOVE capers), the flavors and textures of the various olives weren't very distinctive or exciting.  And I didn't love the flavor of the marinade, which was also more syrupy (had less oil) than I'm used to.  Almost all of the olives were huge (not good in my book) and many I didn't expect to be mushy were.<br /><br />Definitely would not recommend unless you have no higher quality, reasonably priced alternative nearby, or plow through large quantities in a hurry. These are institutional grade with quality to match.  At roughly the same price, my local grocery store's olive bar is a much better option in terms of quality & variety, and specialty stores are better yet.

Not realizing that was the culprit for the seizures, she was placed on seizure medication. We completed the class, we stopped with the pup peronis. We just purchased another pup, and began training with him. Because he was getting the pup peronis, so was the 2 year old dog and she began having seizures again. In researching this, we found there is a link between pup peroni (propylene glycol) and seizures. Poisoning....Buyer beware.

review/summary: Where are these made
review/text: I wish they would indicate where these treats are made. DO you really want to give your dog anything made in China. If its not fit for human consumption how can it be good for your dog. Of course my dog loves these treats, But I wont buy again until and unless they indicate they are made in the USA

review/text: Our dog loves Pup-Peroni.  Ever since he was a small puppy, he has opened the packages himself.  He now has it down to a science.  Hold the pack with one paw, rip a small hole in the top and pull the pup-peroni out one at a time.  There is no mess, just an empty package when done.  Only problem is finding the 1.2 oz packages.  We like to order by the case but can't seem to find anyone who has available stock.

review/text: We order lean Pupperoni by the case her on amazon. Our Shih-Tzu, Tina, loves it. Not only do we give it to her as a treat, we break one up in her food in the morning to make it more palatable to her. We put medicine in her food which deters her from eating it, but the Pupperoni always fixes that.<br /><br />Tina is very finiky and will eat very few types of treats. Pupperoni is her favorite. We've even modified songs in our family to honor the Pupperoni ... "I can't smile without Pupperoni" (Manilow) is a favorite!

review/summary: I can't give them to my dog anymore
review/text: My dog used to really like these, but I can't give them to her anymore because I'm afraid they're poisoned by the Chinese. The Chinese poison dog food you know. Anyway, I used to feed them to her all the time, until the Chinese started poisoning the food. Then I was afraid. I decided that I would have to test all the food before I gave it to my dog. I tried one of these and it made me really sick. I didn't feel well at all so I knew it was poisoned. Now I don't feed them to her anymore. Now all I feed her are Pillsbury Croissants. She really seems to like them a lot. Of course, I still test them before giving them to her. They all seem OK, I would recommend feeding them to your pet. The only peoblem is that she seems to be gaining quite a bit of weight.

review/summary: GREAT TASTING ! !
review/text: I have been trying to eat healthier, but its hard when the things that are good for you cost more then junk food and sometimes the taste makes you wonder if its even worth it. I have tried other soy milks especially in the dairy case and did not like them. I bought this one on sale the low fat vanilla flavor(not in the dairy case)and am amazed at how well it tastes. I am even mixing it with a protien diet shake and it comes out smooth and creamy, which is better then the water that is recommended, no clumps. Tried it in my coffee and its great! This is the product to get it you want to incorperate soy into your diet.

review/text: This is the first protien powder I found.  I thought it was OK.  I tried others, they did not dissolve as well, had more gunk in them I didn't need, and tasted bad.  Really, you can drink it with just water.  It tastes like milk, mostly.  Easy to get used to.  I usually put it in milk.<br /><br />Another thing, this is not just for bodybuilding.  I had a nagging shoulder injury for months, after I started taking extra protien, it healed rapidly.  It really does make a difference for soft tissue injuries.<br /><br />I also find that it kills my appetite.  It's 100 calories (180 with milk), but I don't feel like eating anything else for hours.<br /><br />Check the nutrition info, and how well it dissolves; this is the only choice.

review/summary: Great taste, Good for lean muscle growth
review/text: This is my go to source of a clean protein. It is comparably low in calories, carbohydrates, and sugars which makes it great for building lean muscle. This is not the supplement to take if you want to bulk up and gain mass. The natural-unflavored version that I always get tastes a lot like milk when mixed with water, and does not have chemicals or artificial sweeteners which a lot of other brands use to make their product taste better. The only complaint I have is that the powder doesn't mix very well with just water, and requires a lot of mixing especially if you follow the recommended amount- which to me seems like too much.

review/summary: Builds muscle? Yes. All natural? Yes. Delicious? Ugh, no!
review/text: I wanted to buy a whey protein that didn't have artificial sweeteners and was all natural. Jarrow makes great products. This whey protein has 17g of protein per scoop. It's sweetened with Erythritol which is a sugar alcohol. It's in small amounts so it shouldn't affect people sensitive to sugar alcohols much. If anyone is wondering, the amount of sugar alcohol from what I understand, can give you gas and laxative effects. It's also sweetened with the sweet leaf stevia/rebiana which is calorie free.<br /><br />My only gripe with it is the taste is horrible! Yes, I chug it down fast, but it tastes and smells like cherry cough medicine!

review/text: This is a great product that normally is not available at nutrition stores or discount stores, given that it has NO flavor. The other Whey proteins on the market are either Strawberry, Chocolate, or Vanilla - and make your drink taste nasty. Having the option of no flavor is wonderful, your other ingredients come out of the drink when mixed. Outstanding product and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is actively needing to take protein for dietary or workout purposes.

review/summary: mmmm Milkshake
review/text: I got the 1 pound french vanilla flavor. I haven't tried a lot of protein powders but the few that I have had either a very grainy texture, were chalky or just plain unpleasant. Not this powder though. I mixed mine with cold milk and threw it in the bottle shaker. It dissolved easily, no clumps or grainy texture. It tasted like a vanilla milkshake and along the same lines for consistency. There were no hardships trying to choke it down with big gulps.<br /><br />The reason why I gave it four stars instead of 5 is because after I finished it up, it eventually made my stomach hurt a little from the sweetness. But I have a sensitive stomach so it will take a few more shakes before I'm used to it. I might try the unflavored next time but I'll wait and see what my reaction is after I've finished the whole pound. This will definitely be a second time purchase though.

review/text: Ok, yes, this particular whey protein doesn't contain artificial sweeteners or other stuff you don't want in your diet but it really tastes awful and I haven't found a satisfactory way to dress it up.  I tried putting it in my coffee...it just ruined my normally delicious cup of coffee.  I tried putting it in juice but I had to make the juice (from frozen) really concentrated to make it taste ok..and then it still smells awful.  Jarrows whey may be better than 30 others out there but it's still not good enough to make me happy to take it.  I always like it when other reviewers tell me what's a better option so here's my advice.  Buy a jug of Optimum Nutrition Solid Gold.  It has fake sweeteners which I don't like but it tastes really good in a glass of skim milk! I'll probably throw the rest of this Jarrows whey in the garbage (unless I figure out how to cook with it or something).

I have raved about all of these flavors to everyone who will listen. If you're considering buying these, just do it, you won't be sorry.<br />PS the raspberry flavor is nice and subtle, not overwhelming, and lets the chocolate flavor still come through. Perfect.

review/text: Although these are fat free, they were much to sweet to my taste. Sugar can be just as bad as fat for you... but for being fat free, they are good for those of us who get an hunger attack for something wont make you feel TOO guilty. I can only take it in very small portions because of its sugar content.

review/summary: A delicious and wonderful treat!
review/text: While the notion that you can cut them into 12 tiny 100 calorie servings is a bit silly..these brownies are wonderful, fat free heaven.  I am willing to mail order these beauties just to have the nonfat treat.  Try them hot with frozen cool whip on top and send your diet into taste overdrive!!

review/text: I love these fat free brownies. My 17 yr. old daughter watches her figure and is a healthier eater with a sweet once in a while, yet is picky, and loves them, and my 14 yr. old son is a junk food junkie and will not eat anything that he thinks is diet or has something in it that doesn't sound good (and he saw they I added yogurt), yet he raves about these brownies and they are excited whenever I make them!! I love them because they help my chocolate craving and keep me on trake with Weight Watchers-I've lost 11.8 lbs. so far!! Yeaaaaah!<br /><br />michelle from MI

review/summary: Hard to stop snacking on these!
review/text: I recently purchased these hemp seeds in the Caribbean Crunch flavor and didn't know what to expect. These quickly grew on me and I found myself unable to stop pouring them into my palm and eating them. The flavors are delicious, with just a hint of heat and a hint of sweet. I was pleasantly surprised to find out these little powerhouse seeds contain a lot of calcium and iron as well as being easily digestible proteins. I am thinking the plain ones could be really yummy and fun in plain yogurt mixed with honey and/or fruit. I am on the SCD diet so I really don't eat grains anymore, and I hate to eat a lot of meat so I am using seeds and soaked and dehydrated nuts as a bigger part of my diet. These are a bit pricey but are very nutrient-dense. A serving is 3 tbsp. There are 6 servings per container. Will be buying these again and trying all varieties.

review/summary: TASTES AMAZING, PRICED LOW
review/text: This is an amazing, reasonably priced, flavored coffee--$9.50 for 16 ounces ground-much better than Starbucks at around $11.50 for 12 ounces. The flavor is delicious and we never get tired of it.  The Sunberry company makes excellent coffee that is served in all Sarabeth restaurants in NYC, where we fist found it. It is a well run, family business that is very service oriented.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this Brand and this flavor. We buy 24 lbs a year for our in-home business use. When there was a problem with Fedex Ground delivery once, they even delivered it personally.<br /><br />WOW. Now THAT's  service!!!!

review/summary: Inconsistent Quality
review/text: I bought these to pack with other "quick snacks" (nuts, licorice, trail mixes, chips, etc) for my co-workers who were going to be working long days with little opportunity to eat regular meals.  While most of the boxes were fresh and delicious (according to my co-workers), I did see that a few boxes appeared to be stale and the contents were stuck together (you had to smashed the box in order to break-up the contents).  The fresh boxes were delicious but the stale boxes took away from the overall quality and satisfaction of the entire purchase!  Wish I would have read the other reviews before purchasing...looks like the quality/consistency has remained the same.  Should have been 2 stars instead of three.  Still love the prize inside!

review/summary: One out of nine packages was NOT defective
review/text: The defective packages have holes or ripped areas in the bottom. This let air in and caused entire contents to solidify. Some of these opened packages had been re-sealed with scotch tape. The outer carton was in good shape, so the defects must have been at the source, rather than at Amazon. I will not permit any of the Cracker Jacks in the carton to be consumed because of the risk of contamination.<br /><br />Also, it appears Frito Lay, the people who produce Cracker Jacks, is using Amazon as a place to dump the products. The expiration date on the packages was November of 2008. Looks to me like Amazon got dumped on and I was left holding the bag.<br /><br />Cracker Jacks is apparently not a returnable item.

review/text: This product is labeled "3 oz boxes".  This is not true.  They are 1 oz.  I would not have purchased these had I known they were the small 1 oz.<br /><br />Also, they expire in 10 days.  This is misleading.  What they are selling as current stock is actually "salvage".  This should be disclosed to the consumer so they could make an educated choice.  Product that is unsellable to wholesalers should not be dumped on consumers via Amazon.  I would have paid more at another site rather than get a product that is ready to be thrown away.

review/summary: Tasty treat far from home!
review/text: I recently had been living in South Korea for over a year, and there we have Seaweed we use to wrap and make Kimbab, Onigiri wraps or Sushi.. This stuff is a smaller version of what we use here. It is roasted/salted just like the good old flavor of what we have here, for those of you familia with the taste. I just wish it came in a larger size! This is a smaller "snack size" which is more likely to be used for finger-food sized servings. If you do like this product, look for a local Korean market in your town. There isn't one near me here in Palm Beach Gardens (yet) hence the shopping on Amazon. Cheers!

review/text: First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.
