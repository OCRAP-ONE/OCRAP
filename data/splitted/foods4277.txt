review/summary: I disagree!
review/text: I have tasted the entire line, and this was the only one that I was disappointed with. With a name like "Mate Chocolatte," I expected chocolate or cocoa flavor. If there is any, it is awfully subtle. It is still a decent cup of mate, it's just that the other flavors in the line are true to what they claim to be -- mint, orange, chai, red. You can read an extensive review of the line here[...]

review/summary: Love Pop Up Bowls
review/text: I'm not really sure about the review that talks about having such a bad time with these bags- I've gone through upwards of 20 boxes of them already and haven't had a single problem with them.  It took me a try or two to figure out what time worked best, but since my "microwave button" never worked to begin with, I was already used to taking the extra ten seconds to do it myself.  For my microwave, 2:22 works perfectly.  It pops almost every kernel and doesn't burn a single piece.<br /><br />I've noticed that with these pop-up bags, the butter seems to be more evenly distributed, and the popcorn has a less dry consistency, so I'm a HUGE fan of that!  I also love that I don't have to make the choice between getting a bowl dirty or getting my hands buttery anymore.  It takes a time or two to get used to tearing the top off the popup bowl, but once you get it it's pretty darn easy.  Just do it SLOWLY to make sure you don't rip the bag.  It may be a pain to get it off, but you have to realize that if it wasn't attached so securely, it would come apart in the microwave.  Five stars!

review/summary: An improvement over bags
review/text: I really like this new popcorn bowl design. It's not perfect, but I think it's a lot better than the traditional bag. I have always liked to put my popcorn in a big bowl to mix up with some toppings (Sriracha or popcorn seasoning) and avoid a greasy smear from the outside of the bag, but that can be inconvenient sometimes. This product solves that problem.<br /><br />I had a hard time opening the bowls at first and spilled a decent amount of popcorn while figuring it out, but I got the hang of it after a few tries and no longer spill any. The trick is to go slow and peel off both sides separately before the middle. I use my microwave's popcorn setting and have had no problems with the popcorn burning or not popping completely.<br /><br />I don't think there's anything especially good or bad about how this popcorn tastes. It's like any other brand of 94% fat free popcorn that I've ever had--dry and not especially tasty until you add something to it. It's similarly priced to other popcorns at my local grocery store, so it's definitely worth buying for me. All in all I like this product and hope it sticks around!

review/summary: You have to love hulls
review/text: I will say it is not overly salty or greasy and the taste is mild. When the kernels pop the hull is the most notable part.  It's sort of like eating nuts with the shell still on.  I also wasn't that impressed with the bag/bowl.  Everybody wants their popcorn to be hot but that very heat makes it hard for me to open properly.  Yeah, yeah, I'm a wimp. But think about your ten year old grabbing a baked potato without a mitt.  Apologies to those who love this product but I won't pay for it again.

review/summary: Orville Redenbacher's Pop-Up Bowl Smart Pop Butter Microwave Popcorn
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PXBBP6">Orville Redenbacher's Pop-Up Bowl Smart Pop Butter Microwave Popcorn, 6-Count (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />I bought this on Amazon and actually subscribed to have the product delivered monthly.  However, once I received it my husband and I noticed a distinct difference in the taste so we compared the box to a box we bought at the grocery store.  It appears that O.R. may be changing the recipe for the smartpop pop-up bowl.  We noticed in the upper left hand corner of the box (from Amazon) it says, "New and Improved Now with No Saturated Fat", higher sodium levels and another difference is the large ear of yellow corn behind the red label on the front of the box.  Now, the other box we usually buy (from grocery store) has bold blue and white fanfare stripes behind the red label and no mention of the saturated fat.  I'm guessing this is the original "bowl" when they first came out.  Anyway, there is a distinct difference in the taste.  The "big ear of corn" box leaves a nasty tasting residue in your mouth.  The "blue and white fanfare" box is DELICIOUS and I sure wish they had left it alone!  The nutrition value difference is .05g of sat fat...that is point zero five grams difference plus it has MORE sodium.  This new formula has ruined the flavor for me.  I just can't go the "new and improved" popcorn.  Don't just take my word for it, give it a try and you will see the huge difference in taste (and aftertaste)!  Here is a link to the good popcorn, so you can see the difference in appearance.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FSAV90">Orville Redenbacher's Pop Up Bowl Butter Popcorn 3 pk 8.7 oz (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Pop Up Bowl is Terrible
review/text: The bowl bag does not pop in the same amount of time as a normal bag so it makes your microwave's popcorn button useless. Additionally, about half of the bags are faulty and open when popping resulting in very little popped popcorn. Last, I have found it almost impossible to get the bag to pop completely even when watching it pop (since I can't use the popcorn button!). Overall, this new bowl design is terrible and I would recommend switching to another brand until they go bag to the old bags that work.

review/text: This new feature of popping corn in a container that can be turned into bowel should appeal to most everyone, but in this case they should have spent more time trying to improve the taste of the popcorn. It's dry and tasteless. You could be eating sawdust and not know the difference. Their powdered butter flavor is worthless. Wonder why companies don't spend more time trying to improve the flavor of their food rather that how much and how fast they can get it to market?

review/summary: Deliciously similar to the real thing!
review/text: I found the new Crystal Light mocktails at my local grocery store for about three bucks each marked as "temporary" and now they don't have them. This is the only place I know of to get them.  Crystal Light's new flavors are Mojito, Margarita, and Appletini.  I love real Mojitos and Appletinis and I also love Crystal Light (though I had been a bit bored of most of the flavors at this point).  The Appletini mix is like drinking Jolly Rancher green apple candy. It has that fake-apple taste and a slight sourness, which is very similar to the less expensive appletini mixes.  If you make your own appletinis using things like sour apple pucker, you might not appreciate this as much.<br /><br />Each canister has 5 packets, and each packet makes two quarts.  An 8 ounce glass is 5 calories.  Keep in mind that a real appletini (3 to 4 oz) can be about 160 calories.<br /><br />If you want something similar to Appletinis and delightfully different from other Crystal Lights, you'll love this!  I have several non-drinking friends who come to our dinner parties (which have lots of alcohol flowing), and this is a great option for them.<br /><br />I like the Mojito and Margarita better. This one gets old rather fast.<br /><br />UPDATE: this is the response I got from Kraft when asking if these would be available.<br />We are delighted to hear of your interest in our CRYSTAL LIGHT Mocktail Powdered Soft Drink Mix. As you may already know, this product is only being manufactured and distributed for a limited period of time. For that reason, we are unable to provide any additional information on the stores that may still have the product in stock.

review/text: My husband and I recently purchased a Sodastream machine to make our own sodas and we have discovered that making sodas with powdered mixes works quite well.  After trying a soda with the Appletini flavor, I have found my new favorite soda!  For those people who say the flavor is too sweet, it's very easy to dilute the flavor by adding more water.  We do this all the time with our soda because my husband likes a sweeter soda than I do.<br /><br />Please don't discontinue this flavor!

I love this flavor; it's one of my favorites put out by Crystal Light (it's still available at some stores as well as on Amazon).  When I was a child, I loved Sour Apple candy like Jolly Ranchers.  The Appletini tastes really similar, but I think an Apple Martini tastes the same.  If you like the sweet "Sour Apple Candy" flavor, you'll probably love this drink mix.

review/text: I love sour apple tastes, and that's exactly what I got when I bought Appletini out of curiosity. I find it to be just tangy enough and quite delicious (so much I'm writing a review, which I pretty much never do). However, I don't know how much water I put in it (I eye it) and tend to put in a bit less so it doesn't taste too watered down, if that affects anything. But basically, if you love sour apple flavors, you'll love this.

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: My husband and I drink a good amount of Crystal Light powdered beverages. I was initially leery of purchasing this particular flavor but after trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and finding it great, I thought I would give this one a try.  In terms of flavor, I think a kid (or the kid at heart) would enjoy this more than an adult.  It is very sweet and very green.  I immediately thought I was drinking a liquidized green jolly rancher but it also reminded me of the green ooze in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show.<br /><br />If you live near a Meijer, you can buy a five pack canister of the  Appletini (as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LJ04">Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>) for about 2.79.<br /><br />If you recycle your plastics, be aware that Crystal Light sells its product in a #5 container. Unless you live in a relatively progressive place, #5 plastics are typically very difficult to recycle.  Whole Foods engages in a recycling initiative to collect #5 plastics but if you don't live near one and you care about recycling, these can be a challenging item to deal with.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is a beverage I would not buy again.  It is too sweet and not as good as other Crystal Light options.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E53TMQ">Crystal Light Sunrise Ruby Red Grapefruit, 3.4-Ounce Unit (Pack of 6)</a> are my two favorites and I would recommend them before this one.<br /><br />2.5 to 3 stars

review/summary: Doggie Crack!
review/text: I love the Plato line of products as they allow me to just mindlessly pick from the line and know that I am feeding something good to my dog(s). As for "Smart Dog Snacks" with Ginkgo Biloba and DHA...I'd better watch out, because my dogs love these treats so much that the treats just may make them smart enough to figure out how to open the "treat cabinet" take the container down and unscrew the lid to help themselves!<br /><br />While the treats themselves look like beef jerky, they are made with all natural, organic ingredients. The dogs don't care what's in these treats, they just know they love them. As I am typing this they are both sitting at attention, staring at me and whimpering while trying to do the Jedi Mind Trick of "you want to give us more Smart Dog Snacks, pick up your hand from that keyboard and reach in the container and hand us more. Do it. Do it now."<br /><br />There's so much junk out there and plenty of junk food that claims to be natural (just like people food) but this stuff is the real deal. Much like the food that I feed to the humans in the family, I know what each of the ingredients are and love that the first two ingredients are duck and brown rice. There aren't cost cutting fillers in these treats; it's a straight up high quality product. As an aside, I've bought from the seller, The Whole Healthy Pet many times, and I am always impressed with the products they carry. Just as I know that I can trust the Plato brand, I know that if a product is being carried by The Whole Healthy Pet, then it is a high quality product and I feel like a good parent getting it for my dogs.

review/summary: Plato duck "cookies"
review/text: My dog underwent allergy testing a month ago to determine why he's was so itchy and losing hair.  He's now having allergy shots and the vet recommended we limit his diet to duck and potato for now.<br /><br />I bought duck and potato biscuits at the pet store but there was nothing on the package that stated where this product was made; although my dog liked them, I was bothered that a smoke flavoring was obviously used.  Then I found duck jerky at the pet shop but it is made in China.  The store clerk said none of the customers had complained about it and my dog seems OK with them but I decided to look around<br /><br />I was relieved to find these duck treats as they are made in the U.S.  They arrived yesterday and as soon as I opened the bag, my dog was right there.  His eyes light up when he sees the blue bag and I call these his duck cookies.  My only wish is that these didn't have salt.<br /><br />Just wanted to alert people planning to order these - the first time I ordered these, I bought four bags and all of the bags were fine - however, the second time, I bought two bags and I just noticed that there were a number of strips in the bottom of the second bag that are covered in mold - I had to chuck the moldy ones in the trash (with my dog watching wide-eyed) - so I'm glad this is now available through the subscribe and save program - I hope ordering one bag at a time will avoid the risk of this happening again

review/summary: Made and packaged in USA...
review/text: I purchased these as an alternative to the duck jerky (made in China) that I no longer wanted to feed to my small/medium dogs.  Since one is allergic to chicken my choices are limited.  These arrived today and my 3 dogs sniffed them suspiciously.  I broke them in half for them and they decided to give them a try.  They seemed to like them...they are different then I thought they would be.  They are almost the texture of a soft granola bar and not like jerky at all.  They are about 2" by .5" and the  contents of the bag were not crumbly like some have described.  All in all, I think these will work to replace the  jerky and since they are made and packaged in the US, I feel better about giving them treats.... Oh, and the  cost is pretty good too...

review/text: My boxer has food allergies and I looked all over the internet for duck products. I finally found Platos. She loves them and they are made in the USA. No reason to fear these products. I only buy dog products from the USA, I will not chance my pets life to save a few bucks. Besides, Amazon sells them cheaper than every other site I found them on.

She doesn't like to have her nails clipped so we reserve these strips as an extra special way of rewarding her for letting us clip her nails.  These strips have worked magic with allowing us to be able to clip her nails.

review/summary: Excellent treats and made in the USA
review/text: I've tried all three (and yes, the Salmon is fishy smelling and a bit greasy) and the dogs love them all. It is hard to find dog treats worth buying that are made in the USA that don't cost a fortune. These are reasonable. Don't be fooled by companies that are based in the US but the actual manufacture is in a country not to be named. I also will buy treats made in Canada. I think most pet stores, including ones like Petsmart and Petco are charging way too much for DOG TREATS. I found mine at a human health food store (Fruitful Yield) and was surprised at the cost. Now I see I can order all three from Amazon, shipped for a comparable price. Just wish I could order items in the US and have them shipped from Amazon to say England or Australia. Would love to easily send these to my friends' dogs.

review/summary: very good value for organic treats-good for your pupper
review/text: These are very inexpensive at this site because they are usually twice the price in all the typical pet stores you usually go to.  They are an awesome deal for organic.  I try to feed my dog only organic food and treats as close to all organic as I can.  I had a dog that was very young, 2 1/2, and he died from cancer and ever since then, I have been very cautious of what I feed my dog now.  Organic does make the difference and these treats are low in calories so they are a good treat to give your dog if you are trying to control his weight.  You don't have to feel guility giving him/her these treats, they are small and as I mentioned low calorie.  I would reccomend these to any dog owner and I have also purchased the chicken, duck and salmon treats made by Plato, all good choices.  The Salmon ones are very very stinky though, beware of those, good for your dog though, lots of Omega 3's in them.

review/summary: My Chihuahuas HATE This Product
review/text: My two Chihuahuas loved "Cadet Gourmet Pet Treats Duck Breast Fillets", the 32-Ounce package I had been buying at Costco.  However, I discovered it was made in China and feared this product could make them sick or cause death.  So I started searching for a company in the USA that made dog jerky treats.  I found Plato Natural Duck Strips and ordered a bag.  This product does not look like or smell like duck jerky strips.  My Chihuahuas sniffed it and just walked away.  It doesn't even smell like duck.  Rather, it smells somewhat fishy.  A waste of my money!

review/summary: These are duck chunks not strips
review/text: My darling dog can only eat duck snacks, she is allergic to everything else. I had ordered Plato duck strips before and they are excellent. (Seriously, is there anything a dog won't eat?) But these are CHUNKS, thus the FOUR stars instead of five. They are about 2 inches long and an inch wide, preformed snacks. The Plato strips I bought before were duck strips, not preformed. Of course she loved these but they are covered in a bit of "duck dust" for lack of a better term, so I didn't like to handle them as well as strips. Shipping was quick. The packaging says that these are made in America, important to me. If I am going to pay premium prices for dog snacks, I don't want to kill her with Chinese products! If you asked her, she would give them FIVE stars, because they smell "duckier".

review/text: These are expensive (I would guess the 24 oz pkg contains maybe 20 sticks), but you can cut or break them in half (harder to break smaller pieces off) to make them last longer.  They're a huge hit with our two big guys - have to admit I was shocked at how quickly our big dog consumed one when we first opened the package!  I like varying protein source, so they split one each morning along with a mix of other snacks - it's a real treat for them, and Made in USA is a BIG plus for me as "Mom."

review/text: I got these from my local pet store, where they carry quality items (made in USA, no grain fillers, etc.).  I brought my pooch in one day for his regular food and the shop owner gave the pooch two of these.  Needless to say, I am a sucker for my pooch so of course I bought them.  After my dog had one of his legs amputated due to bone cancer, I switched from the common store brands to higher quality items like this.  I have noticed a marked improvement in my dog's overall recovery.  Even if your dog isn't suffering any kind of terminal illness, I recommend that you consider these sticks.

All of the Italian dressings that I found had high fructose corn syrup and/or soybean oil. I am in the food manufacturing business and I know how cheap soybean oil is and personally I'm not a fan of the taste, which is why I went to Amazon to find a good Italian vinaigrette made with real olive oil. This is my favorite Italian dressing that I have ever tasted. I like it better than Newman's own, Bernstein's, Ken's Steak House, and Wishbone. There is one version of Bernsteins that I like as much as this, but I can't seem to find it anymore. In any case, this is about as good as it gets I think.

There is a good balance between the herbs and olive oil to make this salad dressing taste good in different types of food. If you like vinegrette, you will find many uses for this product. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: I do care...BUT...
review/text: I do not mind paying a little more for environmentally-friendly products.  Most of the time they work well, just as good as their unfriendly equivalents.  It is worth it, to me, to budget for the extra expense in hopes that I am leaving a lesser footprint on the planet.  That said, as much as I hate dumping disposable products into land fills, I also hate paying *so* much more for something that doesn't deliver good results.  I have used several If You Care products (love their baking paper in sheets) and have been satisfied with the performance of those products. In my opinion, these gloves are super expensive and they are *not* worth it.  They thin out - sort of wear through - in spots rather than get holes like other gloves. Where my fingers do not reach, the rubber gradually turns a different color and cracks.  I've had this happen with four pairs.  I would not buy these again, nor would I recommend them to a friend.<br />UPDATED 11/2011:  I have added a star to my former review as I have found a way to extend the life of these gloves.  It doesn't change my opinion that overall they are grossly expensive for their performance, but I thought it was fair to report added product  performance.  I have found that if I dry the gloves off with a towel then they last longer.  My tendency was to allow them to drip dry. I think the pooling of water on the tips as they were hanging prematurely eroded the tips of the gloves.  Since I have dried them and not allowed drip drying, they last longer.  I am toying with the idea of buying more of them.

review/summary: Like overpriced soda that doesn't taste good...
review/text: When will the price of energy drinks stop being so high?  It's ridiculous..and I wish the "phase" would be over so these were actually priced at what they are worth.  I'd have just bought just one to try it if I could but I don't see these around here.  Not a good taste...some-what citrusy but sour and hard to choke down.  I've had many sugar-free energy drinks that actually taste GOOD.  Tiny cans, not much in them but carbonation and some added vitamins..not even that much caffeine.  I tried drinking two at a time..no effect.  I won't be purchasing again.

Yes your dog may love them but even if you put them outside to eat them your dogs face/fur smells like the hoof of a horse that has been standing in poop for months. I bought these because the price of "flossies" tripled but I would rather give my dog an expensive flossie version treat once a month than one of these stinky things once a week. I will never buy again and will be tossing 15 of them in the garbage!

review/summary: These are NOT "Low Odor"
review/text: Be advised, 20 Bully sticks for $35 is a good deal, but these are NOT Low Odor, they smell absolutely atrocious. Another review said the same thing but I figured I'd give them a chance anyway.<br />The first warning sign was when my mailman delivered them and asked what was in the package because they made his whole truck smell. I opened them once inside and GAGGED... I honestly don't know how they get away with calling them Low Odor, if I were to be asked Id say they were Extra Stinky... they really were terrible.<br />My wife said to leave them outside to air out so Ill let you all know if that helps, but I have smelled rancid, putrid meat that smelled better. If overnight airing doesn't help at all I WILL be returning them.<br />Not reccomended unless you have NO sense of smell.

review/summary: Better than EVERYTHING
review/text: 5 stars, 10 if it were possible.<br />2 mini-doxies who ate homemade from birth to 2, then went onto 'natural' kibble (Holistic Blendz, Hund n Flocken) and developed urine crystals, then went to a vet kibble that got rid of the crystals but developed another crystal.  I needed a solution that wouldn't take all day to prepare, and without grain (dachshunds are better off with potatoes as their starch, no rice or corn).  First impressions - smells good helped by garlic and oh look! I can actually recognize the bits of potato, broccoli and carrots! - add water, so far pretty easy.  Add beef?  I can't bring myself to do the raw thing, but I get organic ground beef from Costco, poach it, and when it's cooled down I add it to the Europa.  Store 3-4 days worth in the frig, and it's done.  Doggies used to sniff at the kibble and swallow enough of it to sustain life.  Now they can't wait to eat.  They're down to healthy weights, which is key for doxie backs, and the vet proclaims the smooth is the "best looking dachshund" he has ever seen.  They're running and playing like puppies at the ripe old age of 7.  I give them Missing Link Plus supplements, Cosequin DS to keep joints in good shape.  I feel like I'm doing a good thing for them, and I want them around me for many more years to come. I can't thank Sojourner Farms enough for understanding the need for grain-free food, let alone the absolute purity of preparation and ingredients. Someone there actually thought about the dog first.  I'm sure it takes longer to prep and dehydrate the vegetables than to pulverize and kibble-ize something far less healthy, but Sojos is doing it anyway and I for one am grateful for the product.  Costly?  I can't even calculate the value when I see the difference it has made in my dogs after just 2 months.  They ship it free from the Sojos web site, and so does Amazon.  Friends, just do it.  You can make it in the time it takes you to cook supper. You'd do it for your kids.  And your dogs don't talk back!!

review/summary: You Gotta Try this!
review/text: I have a beautiful 3 year old black and white Cocker Spaniel.  During the first several months with her, she demonstrated some puzzling symptoms...jerking and shivering, even in 100 degree summer weather...I took her to the vet. but he could find nothing wrong.....Instinct told me otherwise....So I tried giving her what we give our patients in the ER, when they have ingested something toxic...Activated charcoal....the shivers and jerking stopped.....I suspected immediately that something in the kibble type food I was giving her was toxic to her nervous system.....up to this point she would stare at the Kibble type food and eat only enough to survive.....I began a search for a substitute...thanks to a knowledgable pet store owner who showed me a bag of Sojos Europa...I now have a pet that no longer shivers or shakes, her coat is very healthy.....she has the energy of a puppy, and her breath no longer stinks....I mix Sojos with cooked chicken snapper and salmon, not all at once.  She loves it.  I'll try some other meats soon.....bottom line is this is really good stuff.....Read the list of ingredients,  this stuff smells so good,I have been tempted to taste it myself...but remember tasting lemon soap the Fuller Brush Man brought when I was a kid, but that's another story.

review/summary: My dogs love it
review/text: I love this product but the vegetable pieces are a little too big for my dogs to digest.<br /><br />Every time I get a new bag of Sojos Grain Free (previously "Europa") I grind up the whole bag using my spice grinder.  This makes it easier for them to digest and I don't have pieces of bright orange carrot in their poo anymore.<br /><br />When I grind it up like this it also hydrates much more quickly, which is important. If it's not properly hydrated, the dog can get constipated.<br /><br />I always feed this with raw meats such as chicken, beef, or lamb.  I sometimes add it to cooked fish or scrambled eggs, but I don't do this more than once a week.  Also, I add a little bit of organ meat a few times a week.  You should use organic liver because this is where the toxins build up.<br /><br />To make it less expensive, I get chicken necks and trim meat.<br /><br />I hope this helps!

It made me uncomfortable with their quality control and what actually goes in the food.  I won't purchase again.  The presence of this plastic is utterly unexplainable!<br /><br />*********************************<br /><br />I think this is a fabulous product, but I do have an issue with the inconsistent product quality.  This last batch was really slimy and some previous batches had a lot of excess green flakes (broccoli?).  Most of the dogs that I know of that eat this product at some point stopped eating it (probably sick of it).  I would suggest alternating with other types of dog food.

review/summary: have been using for several years but.........
review/text: Enjoyed this product for several years.  They have however made changes to the recipe...changing the type of calcium added and other ingredients that seem to have changed. Seems like there is more powder added to the vegetables in the Europa.  So white with calcium you can't even tell the colors of the vegetables. I have written them to inquire about the ingredient changes but haven't heard anything back yet.  My dogs don't care for it much anymore.  It always seems that when a company has a good product they eventually change it to cut costs and it goes downhill from there. Hope this isn't the case with SOJOS.<br /><br />PS. Did hear back from Sojos after resending and asking for a courtesy response. They have changed the formula from calcium carbonate to tri-calcium phosphate with added Vitamin D.  For folks with kidney patient dogs..please do your homework about the effects of the tricalcium phosphate (phosphorus)on kidney patients.Sojos makes a good product.  I hope they reconsider this recipe change so that it will be safe and healthy for all dogs.

review/summary: The best food for any dog!!!
review/text: Like the last review, I have a mixture of dogs.  The 2 Chihuahuas can eat anything and fair pretty well. Our mini long haired mini dauschand is another matter. He suffered terribly from skin rashes and ear/yeast problems.  We put all the dogs on this diet and Volia! no more skin or ear problems.  I do not cook the meat before mixing it, since I have never heard of a dog cooking in the wild.  They are domesticated, but their basic anatomy has not changed, so raw made sense to me.  When my vet first found out, she gave me a lecture about the dangers of raw meat THEN examined my dog.  She changed her tune very quickly, saying that my dog was one of the healthiest she had seen: great muscle tone, perfect weight, great teeth, ect.  All 3 have much higher energy levels and their coats are so pretty and soft now. AND no "dog" smell to them which is a great change from the skin and ear/yeast odor the poor dauschand suffered from.  All 3 dogs love this diet and take turns relicking each others bowls for a good while before I finally pick them up. It has been a good 4-5 years now and they are all doing great. We previously had a golden who suffered the same as our dauschand his whole life (10 years) I wish I had known about this food then!

review/summary: Sensitive dogs love this stuff!
review/text: I've got two greyhounds.  One can eat anything and be fine.  The other has an ultra-sensitive stomach.  He's suffered from diarrhea since Day 1 and has kept us up night after night with an upset stomach.  We've tried everything: way high-end kibble, Urban Wolf, tons of different canned dog foods.  I saw this in the pet store one day and decided to try it.  I mix about 1 pound of mix with 9 lbs of boiled hamburger and sometimes add a little cooked brown rice. Wow!! Both dogs go crazy for this stuff.  It smells so good I'm tempted to eat it myself.  Mr. Sensitive Stomach sleeps all night, has solid stools, has a great coat and practically knocks me over when I open the refrigerator to get his food out.  The other one loves it, too.  I never have to worry about washing their bowls because there isn't a speck of food left. I'm thrilled I found this product and I highly recommend it to everyone.

review/summary: This stuff rocks!
review/text: Since I have started feeding Sojos Grain Free to my two 10 and 12 yr old poodles, I have noticed that they are very enthusiastic about their food, their coats look better, and my 10 yr old Standard who was a poop eater has shown much less interest in doing that.  She also used to have near daily episodes of urping up undigested food, and that has totally stopped. They also have nicer breath, and less gas.  I add poached chicken or raw beef, canned salmon, eggs or cottage cheese to the mix.  The result does look and smell like I could eat it myself.  I supplement with a probiotic and enzyme powder, and salmon oil.  My only complaint is that it is expensive.  So, I just remind myself of how much time, energy and money I save not having to shampoo my rugs constantly!

review/summary: Easy and healthy homemade dog food
review/text: Sojos is a dog food mix made up primarily of dehydrated and freeze dried vegetables and fruits.  Sojos is the third dog food mix I've tried, and it comes in second place for simplicity and palatability.  In order to make the mix into dog food,you add water, meat and any other ingredients you'd like.  I typically add leftovers like rice, stew, stir fry, oatmeal, veggies and similar healthy additions to stretch the food.  I usually make a large batch and then freeze all but two servings per dog.  Then I feed the "smoosh" twice per week with fish oil, nutritional yeast and probiotics on top.<br /><br />My favorite dog food mix is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030JFYYA">Honest Kitchen Preference, Grain-Free Foundation Diet For Dogs, 7lb</a>.  The Sojos is less convenient because it needs to sit for at least an hour between mixing and feeding ("preferably overnight"), while Preference is ready in about 20 minutes.  Preference contains a lot of alfalfa and kelp (which STINK during preparation) and chelated vitamins, so it's my number one choice.  Both of these diets are very healthy, so either one is an excellent choice for your dog.

review/summary: changed formulation?
review/text: My Sheltie suffered from chronic constipation, my Border Collie mix had unexplained bouts of cramping diarhea (sp?) about once a month while on their trainer's recommended high-quality kibble diet from a feed store, supplemented with home-cooked veggies and chicken.  Once I switched to serving SOJO Comlete for one of their daily meals, both GI problems disappeared for good. They both loved the product and any 'pickiness' in their eating habits disappeared. Their coats are remarkable and they're all-around healthy, active dogs.<br /><br />BUT - I noticed a bag-to-bag inconsistency of the proportion of powder vs. chunks.  The company explaiuned to me about six months ago that they were aware of that and were about to make a change that would make it more consistent. Then about  4 months ago I noticed what I suspect was a change in formulation.  The product smelled strongly of broccoli.  My sheltie began nosing the pieces of broccoli aside, and then stopped eating SOJO food altogether.  I gave him back his kibble plus veggies, and after two months began substituting some of the SOJO back in.  Same result - not eating it.  So I began picking out the larger pieces of broccoli. I was surprised to find that his 1-cup portion of food contained nearly 1/4 c broccoli - fully 20% to 25% of the product.  For nearly $75 per bag?  Can you imagine your human diet consisting of one quarter broccoli?  I'm not happy and will again contact the company about this.

It's much more convenient than preparing real home made food, and cheaper (if you buy the meat in one of those big family packs) than buying premium canned dog food. And it's real, healthy food! We have to feed our dog, who is a thin breed, more than the amount recommended on the bag. I'm not sure if my dog just has a really fast metabolism (lucky her!) or if this is true for everyone.

review/summary: hounds have stopped shivering, scratching their coats and getting goopy eyes
review/text: I bought Sojos because of the reviewer who mentioned that their dog would shake uncontrollably. My 3lb dog (hound was a joke) would do this all the time. She also had constant dried sleep in her eyes; I'd wash her face every day. My other dog would scratch herself constantly with her back legs. My vet recommended Science Plan or some such kibble designed for dogs with sensitive skin. I asked why the normal kibble they sold would aggravate it. No answer. And clearly--- it's time for a change.<br />I love Amazon and that I could find this food. Talk about a 180. They LOVE this food. They can't wait to eat (they both sit and squeak if I'm even 10 mins late with it- they used to look at me with total nonchalance when I put the kibble down)and my littlest one has put on nearly 2lbs which she desperately needed. They are both healthier, happier dogs. No more skin scratching! No more eye goop. I mix it with ground turkey or chicken breasts. Also eggs are awesome with it and they love them.<br />God knows what goes into kibble. I would NEVER feed it to an animal again. Vets who shill that stuff should be ashamed.

review/text: I rescued two Korean jindos over the past 12 months, and the female had really bad food allergies. Since the breed evolved on an island off South Korea - subsisting on rice, veggies, meat scraps and fish - I definitely wanted to take them off kibble and onto something more "native."<br /><br />After a couple of weeks on Sojos and meat, they are now enthusiastic eaters, licking their bowls clean after every meal. I can also see a vast improvement in their energy levels, skin and coat. Their eyes are much brighter, and they don't have any more eye discharge. With kibble, they would half-heartedly graze and leave a few behind in their bowl.<br /><br />So thanks Sojos for this product...it's fantastic!

review/summary: My dog's favorite food!
review/text: I have been feeding my dog, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, a raw or home-prepared diet since she was around 6 months old. She is now almost 4. At the beginning I fed a variety of "high end" kibbles and canned food like Orijen, Solid Gold, Merricks etc. She would have runny poop, crusty eyes and was never that into her food generally, she would not always eat it all, and I didn't like the idea of all the processing, the 5 million ingredients and I have general distrust of pet food manufacturers after all the recalls and problems there have been.<br /><br />When we switched to home cooked things got better, but when we switched to raw it was amazing! She very rarely has any issues at all (except when she eats a take out menu that comes under the door or something!), her coat is beautifully soft and shiny, lots of energy, perfect weight, no eye goop. I feed Sojo's very frequently, usually with beef, and alternate with various brands of ground raw patties like Stella and Chewy's, Primal, Nature's Variety, and whole raw chicken bones, and various organ meats, raw eggs, canned sardines (no salt packed in water), occassional healthy human leftovers like fruits, veggies, yogurt etc. I have also tried The Honest Kitchen mixes, which are good too, but I can tell that she likes Sojo's more. She will sit in the kitchen the whole time I am preparing a batch sniffing the air and getting excited. I mix up a big batch at once and store in pre-measured containers of four serves (two meals per day) in the freezer and thaw one in the fridge at a time. Sojos is very easy to use, even with the change to the calcium I do not find it especially messy and it is important to shake the bag before use to get an even distribution of all the ingredients. I have ordered it from Amazon and also from their own website (where shipping is also free) and have always found their customer service to be great. I am glad to support a small company that makes their high quality product in the USA. I am so glad that something that makes it so easy to feed dogs healthily is available.

review/summary: Was a 5 star product.....
review/text: I loved this product until they changed the formula.  The newer version, while they claim it offers more calcium (which is great), has caused the product to be extremely messy.  I know it sound minor, but when the ENTIRE area surrounding the container or bag is completely covered in dust, you will be annoyed.  In addition to the mess, the additional powder/nutrient essentially cut down the amount of food in the bag since the weight did not increase. When I scoop out a portion now, it is hit or miss as far as whether I am going to get 60% or more powder & I worry about the caloric intake my dogs are or are not getting now.  If you are okay with a huge mess and paying more for less (I have two dogs, so the difference is significant), the product is excellent.  Unfortunately, this new change probably result in me looking into other food options for my dogs.

review/text: Ingredients: sweet potato, carrots, broccoli, celery, apples, whole egg, tricalcium phosphate, flax meal, parsley leaf, carob powder, dried kelp, dried alfalfa, ginger root, garlic, vitamin D3.<br /><br />The ingredient list was not on the Amazon product page so when I ordered it I thought it consisted only of dehydrated fruits and veggies. When I received the product I learned it contained whole eggs and garlic in the formula.  My dog is on a low-fat Vegetarian diet to control her cholesterol levels and allergies <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000634HD2">Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula Dog Food, 28-Pound Bag</a>.  I thought of adding this mix-in to make her meals more palatable.  While Sojos is a tasty and natural mix-in that helps my little carnivore miss her meat less, I was disappointed to learn that it has these ingredients in it:<br />1- EGG - is highly allergenic. My dog is allergic to poultry and since this is a poultry product, I'd rather not have this in the formula.<br />2- GARLIC - published as a substance that is toxic to dogs.  My references:  both the ASPCA web site, and the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813819857">Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion: Small Animal Toxicology</a>.  I am including a very short excerpt from the book, "The Allium species of plants belongs to the Alliacae family and includes onions, garlic, chives, and leeks.  These plants contain propyl disulfides and can cause Heinz body anemia when ingested by companion animals.  Cooking, drying, processing, and spoiling do not negate the toxic effect.  Pets on diets with Allium supplementation (e.g. garlic or onion powder) may be chronically poisoned."  Detailed info on pages 457-460.  When I learned this, I quickly stopped feeding my dog this product.  This didn't come cheap and that also adds to my disappointment because now it will have to be thrown out.<br /><br />If the manufacturer changes the formula and removes those two ingredients, I might consider buying this product again.

review/summary: My dogs changed completely on Sojo's
review/text: After all the problems with dry food from other countries and scared that I was making my dogs sick, I started them all on solo's grain-free with raw meat diet.  They love it. They have normal, firm stool and less of it to Poop Scoop.  It seems expensive at first, but the results  are worth it, really.  I mix a large batch of solo's with water as instructed, and put it in the refrigerator, then I mix with assorted raw beef or cooked chicken and turkey.  BE CAREFUL..every dog is different and you have to gauge each dog differently, just like humans.  I have 2 Chihuahuas and a Pom, one chi blew up like a balloon and the other hasn't gained or lost weight.  If you have more than one dog I would have a bowl for each and feed separately and observe! because I found my little fatty was eating what the others left behind in their bowls.  The amazing thing is they no longer beg for treats like they used to.  I always felt like they were starving all the time.  And the big ++++ is that they have actually calmed down quite a bit, not nearly as hyperactive as they were before.  My husband and I sit down for dinner and we never hear or see them.  I'm not a paid spokesperson and I was highly skeptical about this type of diet for my fur kids.  But after seeing previous pets have health problems for no apparent reason, I have to think the dry food is not healthy for them.  Also...very important...I do give them the dry biscuits to help with tarter control on their teeth.  That is the only daily treat I give them now.  I do not feed them anything that is imported from china, nothing against them, it's just not what I feel is best.  The results are in front of me and I see a huge difference.  Just don't get frustrated at first with the preparation of the food.  My chi's and pom each weigh 5 pounds full grown.  I give them a 1/4 cup raw hamburger and 1/4 c hydrated solo's twice a day.  They are very active so that's what has worked for us. Hope this helps you make the change.

review/summary: Great Dalmatian Food
review/text: I have a Dalmatian that can not have meat (due to the fact that he is a stone forming Dalmatian)and this food is better and cheaper than the prescription food (UD) that the vet had him on. Instead of meat I use Egg, Cottage cheese and why protein powder as a protein source. He also can not have oatmeal, beans or peas which most of the vegetarian dog foods use for protein.

review/summary: Quality ingredients, but gives my dog serious gas
review/text: This dog food has quality ingredients, but it gives my dog serious gas, for along time. Also, you're supposed to add the water and let it hydrate overnight, which I didn't expect to have to mess with. I'll be looking for something abit different from this in the future.

review/summary: AMAZING!
review/text: This dog food is awesome.  It smells so good and it could easily be consumed by humans! Speaking of... funny story... I told my husband to smell the prepared dog food I had made and he thought it smelled wonderful.  SO GOOD that he took a big spoonful of it and ate it!  Then I told him it was dog food...  :-  My dogs LOVE this stuff, but a little goes a LONG way. I didn't want my dogs to get a stomach ache  when we first switched so I put a few spoonfuls in with their regular dog food.  That seemed to work well and prolongs the last of both.  The shipping was fast and the service was courteous.  Would order from again.

review/summary: Sojos dehydrated food is great
review/text: Love the idea of grain free - dehydrated food.<br /><br />Switched to raw a couple of months ago and wanted to add in veggies for fiber and fill as I also wanted my dog to loose some weight.<br /><br />He's thriving on the raw and I love that this product is delivered to my door (I hate shopping) and it is less costly to purchase through Amazon than most other on-line and retailers.<br /><br />The veggies are high quality.  I tend to make my dog's food in small batches and I also run the ingredients through a blender to make it easier to digest for my dog.<br /><br />Great product - will continue to buy - wonderful option to high quality dog food.

review/summary: our Standard poodles love this
review/text: Our dogs were having problems with ear issues. We had been feeding them Innova red meat then Evo grain free kibble and although they liked these foods, they still had the ear issues. WE went to a new vet who a  practices Chinese medicine for pets as well as his long standing traditional vet practices. He suggested the SOJOS grain free with non-heat producing meats or fish  or cooked eggs . Since we have been using these foods, our dogs have been clear of ear issues and they love the food, It is easy. Although as others have said, there have been some changes to the food, I do not believe this is a negative. I think the changes have been improvements. I also find the quality to remain high, no problems there either.

review/summary: great but dogs get tired of it
review/text: This is one of the only foods that our border collie has been successful with in terms of allergies and other unwanted side effects of various other high quality grain free foods. We have tried many things but always come back to Sojos. Only problem is she gets tired of it after a while even though we switch up the meats. This is why we keep trying to find something she wont get tired of that will work for her itching allergies. So far no luck - and it seems to be back to Sojos grain free every time.

review/summary: Prefer this to Honest Kitchen Grain Free - Low Phosphorous content
review/text: Although a canine nutritionist insisted Honest Kitchen was better than Sojo's grain free, I like this better.  The Honest Kitchen is ground very fine to aid digestion (I assume) but it just doesn't hydrate as well.  The Honest Kitchen Preference is essentially the same as this product but even though you add the proper amount of water to hydrate and wait the necessary time, it remains dry and powdery.  If you add more water then it gets soupy.  This Sojos' hydrates very nicely, the bit of vegetables are small enough that a human could digest.  So if you are looking for something to add meat or canned dog food to this is the best product that I have I've found.  I was looking for a low phosphorous food to reduce to load on my dog's kidney since she is now a senior.  After 5 years of age it is now recommended you reduce the phosphorous content in your dogs food since so many, many dogs are dying of kidney issues which some say is linked to dry kibble.  If you like dry kibble, Royal Canine makes a senior food which has the lowest phosphorous content of any kibble I have researched.  I'm switching back to Sojos.  It also appears to be kinder on my dog's stomach than the Honest Kitchen.  HK makes great products and I will still use some of their with the meat already added.

review/summary: Sojos almost killed my dog
review/text: My dog, a 3-year-old chocolate lab with no history of allergies, had a severe allergic reaction to Sojos and required weeks of treatment to recover from it.  I took my dog to two different vets, both of whom said the change in his food was almost certainly the cause of the illness.  When I took a closer look at the remaining Sojos food I found that it contained bits of wood, twine and bulap sack material.  When I changed my dog back to his old food, the allergy went away.  Sojos refused to admit that their food was the cause of my dog's illness, and refused to refund even the money I had paid them for the food, let alone reimburse me for over the over $700 I spent for veterinary care.  Don't risk your dog's health with Sojos.  If you want to make home-cooked food, ask your vet for a recipe.

review/summary: Caution, Not as High Quality as they would lead you to believe.
review/text: I was very excited when my local store started carrying this product. I saw this as a relatively cheap alternative to the raw diet I had them on which was great quality but took a lot of work to prepare (the pre-prepped one was even more expensive).<br /><br />For anyone who's done research on dog food, we all know that raw is the best diet we can feed our dogs, it gives them nutritional content, probiotics, moisture, all the things that they need to thrive. For anyone who's been on high grade dog foods, you also know that you can switch foods for your dogs without any concern about stomach/bowel issues. Be forewarned, this is NOT the case with Sojos.<br /><br />I had been feeding my dogs Nature's Variety Instinct Raw (switching as I please between the protein varieties) and Orijen (I switch between all the Orijen flavors). I normally did half in the morning and half a night using one type of food for each feeding. I figure, why not throw Sojos into the mix to give them some variety and save some money. That's when problems instantly began.<br /><br />They liked the food at first, it was new and exciting and they gobbled it up, then when it made its way through their system, they had very runny stool. It was still not too bad and I could understand minor transition time, but by the end of day 1 it was full on diarrhea. I spent an entire weekend (and then some) nursing them back to health, fully on Nature's Variety Instinct mixed with organic pumpkin to settle the stomach. But I spent the majority of my time walking them, and being heartbroken to see bloody stool (knowing I had caused it by carelessly choosing a poor quality dog food product).<br /><br />I know some will argue, 'you didn't transition your dogs,' but honestly, when you stay in the high quality spectrum of dog foods you don't have to. Especially when you know your dogs don't have problems. I've fed them Blue, Candiae, Nature's Variety, Great Life, Orijen, Acana, Nature's Variety Instinct Raw, Earthborn, EVO. And that's not even adding to the mix the versions of those foods that have grain and grain free varieties. I've NEVER had a problem with switching them back and forth.<br /><br />So, this is certainly a better option that Science Diet, but it isn't for everyone, and it certainly isn't for people who want to feed their dogs the best stuff they can. This is NOT a replacement for a raw diet. Please take caution before switching.<br /><br />(Also I read a reviewer who cooks their proteins before feeding it to their dog, how does that not completely defeat the purpose in feeding raw in the first place?)

In fact, I would call it Kitty crack, I have to watch out for my top cat Buddy, he will open up cabinets or climb up on shelves and maybe knock something over trying to get at it.  Just wish they sold it by a big bag at a lower cost per unit weight, expensive for 8 cats. I have bought some alternatives that most of them reasonable like, but they know the difference between the real stuff, and the 2nd te alternative, and a few of them turn their nose up at any alternative treat.  But nobody turns their nose up at this item.
