review/summary: Perfect for basement camel crickets
review/text: I have a moderate camel cricket infestation in my basement and detached garage. I purchased a set of these traps for use in the basement initially and was flabbergasted at the rate at which I trapped those little buggers. Durring the first week that I had the traps down, I must have replaced all of them at least once because they were completely filled. The crickets must have crawled across other crickets to reach the sticky areas in the back corners of the trap! After my success in the basement, I put a few in the garage and caught so much the traps were significantly heavier. Highly recommend this product for medium to large size bugs. It failed to trap tiny spiders as I figure they are just too small to sink into the adhesive.

review/summary: Works great!
review/text: These traps work great for household bound insects. These are glue type traps with a scent block to attract insects. Each unit is actually two smaller traps that you may separate if desired or use as a larger trap. They have entrances on the sides and top for any angle of approach.It is important to move the traps around until you find the insects path. In our case our home was built in 27 and they are coming through the old coal chute area. Once the area was defined and traps placed we have not seen any insects in the basement or upstairs. The best part is that our dog and parrot are not in any danger from poisons. The insects go in and don't come out.

review/summary: Traps full size American cockroaches, nymphs, spiders and flies
review/text: One reviewer stated that these don't work with full size adult roaches, however I've captured three using these traps. I was also surprised to discover that these work great to control small fruit flies, coffin flies, and gnats. The key is to always place them along the wall or in corners. Theyre good to place behind furniture and especially near electrical outlets, as these are the most common paths that insects take when navigating through your home. If you catch nothing at all, move the traps to other areas around the house and try again. They're cheap enough that you should buy more than you think you'll need and then place a couple in each room. Keep in mind that the more you place strategically around the more likely you'll trap insect that treads close enough to catch the scent and investigate. Good luck!

review/text: Bought this thing out of curiosity to tackle some roach problem but ended up regretting it. No roaches entered the boxes for a whole week (checked everyday) despite the "pheromone formula". It did however start trapping roaches after I added some "bait" (Doritos crumbs). So don't expect it to attract roaches on its own. I gave it 2 stars cos it does work when there's something inside attracting the roaches but I found something similar at my local 99c store that worked just as well.

review/text: 2012 March 27 -- I don't want to put a good thing down, so for now I'm giving this 3 stars -- neutral, with hopes for improvement in the future.  We'll see.  I purchased these traps in order to capture some large, winged ants that are literally coming out of the woodwork in my bathroom ceiling.  I know, ugh, gross..  So far, not a single one has been enticed to enter any of the four traps I have placed both high, medium, and low at different sites.  It's been about four days, so I'm thinking this will not work for my particular critters.  (Thank goodness I don't have roaches though...  I won't complain too much.)

review/summary: Traps are working well
review/text: Ordered a 12-pack of these traps from Amazon after reading the reviews.  We just purchased a 120 year old house over the summer, and have been seeing a lot of cave spiders in the basement.  I put all 12 traps out in various parts of the basement (crawl space, laundry area, utility room, and living area).  For about a week I kept checking them but only found one or two bugs, somewhat disappointed but at least it didn't cost me much.  I checked again after about 2 weeks, and was shocked to see that several of the traps were almost filled with bugs (spiders, crickets, beetles).  There are a few traps that haven't been touched, but I will definitely be ordering some additional traps to replace the ones that saw a lot of activity.

review/text: I was going to try boric acid, then I'd have boric acid and dead roaches all over the place. Then I tried Victor Roach Traps. At first it looked like it wasn't working. I then started scooping up the roaches with the traps and then sat them back down. The next morning one trap was almost full. I looked at the other traps and they didn't have as much in them but the roaches were starting to come to the traps and get stuck. The third morning was when I noticed a big difference. About 9 of the 12 traps were almost full. A couple of traps had the big palmetto bugs in them and they couldn't move. And like other reviewers wrote, a couple of the roaches had their eggs hatch while in the trap and it stopped the baby roaches too. I bought more traps and put them all out. All the traps had roaches of all sizes in them. This is a great product!!

review/text: Let me start by saying I don't normally write reviews and I buy almost everything via Amazon so I am compelled on this one. Ok so I have my nice flat panel tv mounted to a brick wall in the house we just moved into...over the course of the last two weeks noticed a big very very ugly silver fish coming out of the wood beam above the brick wall and running to the back of my TV. He or they continued this for the last two weeks. Fire up the Amazon prime and find the solution. Read one review that said this will only attract more silver fish, eggs, infestation and so on. The rest of the reviews were pretty solid. Got these boxes and declared war (placed 4 of them along the brick wall). Brewed a pot of coffee and ready to rock. First night nada. Tonight yes tonight (it's 2a.m. as I write this) I have just watched 5 different silver fish pay the wall a visit and hover near the boxes...so I am thinking sweet. The whole time I think they were laughing at me. They did not got any closer to the boxes and would not go in them. Then they returned to their beam. After about 5 hours of watching these horrible creatures laugh at these boxes I broke out the fly swatter and took care of these nasty guys. Sorry guys these boxes maybe drew out a larger problem that I have but caught nothing!!!!!<br /><br />Sorry for the long review.

review/summary: Ineffective
review/text: If you are pondering whether or not to purchase this product - first mostly, do your research. The reviews on this state some insects were caught - however, some say they weren't effective. Just take a moment and realize that yes, they cost cheap - however, did you know that they use pheromone technology? Did you know that pheromone's only work on certain types of insects? For instance, sure you can get a pheromone to attract women but however, only a few women will respond to the pheromone product for women. This concludes that pheromones that this product contains is less effective with certain insects. If your home is infested with centipedes and home spiders - the best recommendation that has worked for my wife and I is Raid Barrier. It's very effective and over for a past week we seen dramatic results in the reduction amount of spiders and centipedes. You may have greater results by spraying Raid around the outside and some inside (isolated rooms). Do yourself a favor and pass this product up and go now purchase Raid Barrier. Works like a charm and will keep your home safe and comfortable.

The bones were falling out when I got them... a little concerning.

review/text: My 30 pound puppy goes crazy for these, he really loves them.  He's just in heaven when he's chewing on one of these, but they only last about 20 minutes.  If you're looking for something that lasts much longer than a biscuit but doesn't need to last for hours like other rawhide treats then this is perfect.

review/summary: Another fantastic ZiwiPeak product!
review/text: It should have been no surprise to me that the ZiwiPeak canned venison is a hit with my dog as he already enjoys the ZiwiPeak Air Dried Venison Dog Food...but I was indeed surprised at HOW MUCH he loves the ZP canned.  I've been feeding my dog, Titan, another brand of canned dog food so that I could hide his different medications and get him to eat them without having to wrestle his powferful jaws like the late beloved Crocodile Hunter.  While he enjoyed this other brand of 100% venison canned food, he was on to me with the whole pill hiding thing and would root around his bowl and eat around the pills.  Titan is a food motivated dog (you'd think he was a lab rather than a pittie) and usually I could count on telling him to sit, give me paw and then literally drop the ball of wet food with the pills hidden inside into his mouth and he would gulp them down.  Well, a couple of weeks ago, he wouldn't eat the wet in his dish, and when I tried the old 'drop in his mouth' trick, he let the ball of wet food hit him in the snout and didn't even lick it off; he just watched me pick up the mess and waited for me to wipe off his face.<br /><br />Enter ZP canned.  First, this stuff doesn't look like normal canned food.  It has such a fresh quality to it.  Titan loved it instantly.  In fact, I don't even have to hide the pills anymore.  I feed him just like an 80+ baby, spoon feeding him right from the can, except that I place a pill on the spoon as it goes in his mouth.  No getting my hands all messy with shaping the canned food around a pill to conceal it from him.  Titan knows the pill is in there, and as long as he gets a mouthful of the ZP canned, he doesn't care.<br /><br />Oh, and he won't even touch the old stuff with or without pills.  He knows he's moved on up in the quality of food  and there's no turning back!

review/text: If you use gatorade as part of your training than it goes without saying how much of hassle it can be to be buying bottles of the stuff and having to lug cases home. Especially if you're in a big city and don't have easy access to a car.<br /><br />Well these individual packets contain the exact same stuff you'd get pre-made. They're super easy to mix with just a few shakes or stirs (i.e. no clumps of powder) and tastes identical. It's nice to be able to just be able to throw a few in your bag, keep some at work, etc. for when you're on the go.<br /><br />Much cheaper than buying pre-mixed too! This is the only way to go in my book.

Because of the maltodextrin, it does not have the sweetness of high maltose, also the product has its own intrinsic flavor, so you cannot use as a flavor neutral sweetener.<br />The only high maltose vendors I can find are located in China - it would be good to have a US retailer

review/text: This soup is by far the best tomato soup I've ever eaten! Not only is it superior to Campbell's and taste great on it's own (especially with a grilled cheese sandwich) but it is awesome as a base in vegetable soup!<br /><br />I make huge batches of vegetable soup by mixing 1 gallon of water, 2 bags of organic frozen mixed veggies, 1 bag of organic baby lima beans, 1/4 cup of frontier beef broth powder, 1/4 cup frontier veggie broth powder, 1 Tbsp. Onion powder, 2 tsp. Garlic Powder, 1 Tbsp. Kosher Salt, 1 Tbsp. Black (or white) Pepper and 3 cans of Wolfgang Puck Creamy Tomato soup in a slow cooker. I allow this to cook on high for about 1 - 2 hours then I simmer on low overnight. By morning I have the best veggie soup you will ever eat!<br /><br />I buy 1-2 cases of this soup each month and I hope they never discontinue this flavor.

It's addictive, especially because it's so quick to serve (no struggling to dissolve milk or water into it).  I can polish off a whole can just as a snack.  I've also mixed in brown rice or whole wheat pasta for a healthy feast.  Great stuff!!

You can buy cheaper, but you can't buy better tasting soup.  Rich and creamy with enough butter to blend and mellow the flavors.  This is soup like you wish Mom made.  What's best is it is ready to eat right out of the can.  No mixing, nothing to add--just heat and eat.<br /><br />Puck's recipe is simple--a few organic ingredients and fresh Roma tomatoes.<br /><br />Try it with a grilled cheese sandwich (use extra sharp cheddar and add sliced sweet pickles).

review/summary: Over the past several decades, a classic soup went dim, but is now redeemed.
review/text: Wendy Tobler's review pulls out the strong points of this soup.  The tomato flavor is indeed richer because of the butter.  I admire Wendy's courage [risking the soybean gestapo] to mention that, lol. What a joy from heaven it is to have organic, true butter in a soup!<br /><br />[THANK YOU Dr.'s Bruce Fife, Mary Enig, Sally Fallon, and others who have shed light on the dark roots of cholesterol phobia, a phobia pushed since the late 50's, which I immediately dismissed, knowing instinctively, without doubt that for me animal fat, butter, cream, etc., were healthy except when my taste buds and stomach said "no" to them.]<br /><br />I agree with Wendy that the soup is addictive; to me it's addictive in a quiet, good way, which I was pleased to discover.  The simplicity sneaks up gradually, so I can understand those who found these soups more bland than they had anticipated.  I appreciate those opinions, because they prepared me to not expect something seething with saucy spice.<br /><br />Appreciated Wendy's comment about "no struggling to dissolve milk or water into it"... I hadn't thought of that, but it's so true.  At first I thought the amount in the can without water or cream added might not be filling, but it is, absolutely.  Of course I wouldn't be adverse to adding heavy cream, but haven't needed to yet.  Been eating it straight out of the can... microwave heated in a tempered clear-glass bowl... I haven't even added parsley like I do with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM2PGG">Wolfgang Puck Organic Chicken with Egg Noodles Soup</a>.  Usually I don't even need to add my cherished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1SOG">Organic Saltine Crackers</a>, though I used to pack tomato soup with loads of saltines.<br /><br />[Now I save the saltines for other soups, cheese, peanut butter, etc., and my precious, DELICIOUS <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB8AZC">Wild Planet Sustainably Caught Wild Skipjack Light Tuna</a>.]<br /><br />With that experience of increasing satisfaction, added to the effects of Wendy's "no stir struggle" comment, I'm sold on these non-condensed soups.<br /><br />As noted, if I want to alter Wolfgang's soups I can, but the base is easy and good to work from.  I can't delete from something too rich to begin with, but I can quickly add to it, in varieties of ways.<br /><br />Providing canned goods is a different paradigm than cooking "live" for diners who know that a chef's offerings might be richer or spicier than the general public might prefer.  What's interesting, though, is that chefs are often more about subtle, than they are about sassy... when parlaying flavor.<br /><br />Personality is a separate ingredient, LOL!<br /><br />I bought this tomato first [among Wolfgang's offerings] because I had been having trouble finding any type of canned tomatoes [including organic] which tasted okay to me for making spaghetti sauce or a quick tomato-flavored topping.<br /><br />This soup works great on/in meat loaf. I had quit baking Ketchup on top of meatloaf when I discovered how inimical soy products are to me, along with certain types of additives, especially citric acid.<br /><br />Now, thankfully, I've found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4KYQ">Annie's Naturals Organic Ketchup</a> YUM, and can alternate the differences in flavors in this soup and ketchup, for cooking or conventional use.<br /><br />I've been gradually stocking up on 100% certified organic products [without soy] from Amazon.  My friends, neighbors, and postmistress are gaining along with me [gaining health and flavor, not weight], because sometimes they get gift samples of what I order here.  I'm not yet strong enough to begin cooking heavily again, and with just one to cook for, I don't use up extra quantities quickly.  I enjoy sharing this type of honestly good food, especially since it's been so long since grocery stores and restaurants had many alternatives which weren't packed overwhelmingly with soy and its accompanying additives and genetic alterations, leaving very few choices [almost none when you consider other how many goods in addition to foods are impregnated with GMO soy] for those who need to avoid soy of any type.<br /><br />I don't want to limit the marketplace to my own preferences and beliefs; I just want choices available for what I need to survive with enough health to WANT to survive.<br /><br />IMO, no one yet knows for sure what "items" provide essential nutrition to humans and which are either "empty" or deadly toxic, so having clear labeling and choices seems a good way to go.  Thankfully for me, Amazon is continuing to develop tremendous varieties of economic choices, in almost any and everything.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon and Wolfgang,<br />Linda Shelnutt

review/summary: Oh. Thank Goodness!!!
review/text: i came to discover the wonders of tomato soup somewhat late in life, but became fixated. I was very sad when Costco's Kirkland brand stopped selling their tomato soup, which i just loved. I learned it was actually made by the Campbell's Company, but the ingredients appeared to be specially mixed for Costco, and I've found no equivalent in other Campbell's many tomato soup offerings, which don't taste so good. I don't know why Kirkland's canned tomato soup disappeared from my Costco, but it has now been a long, sad, taste journey for me, through many many cans of brands and tubs of specialty-type tomato soups. I was a bit leary of the Wolfgang Puck label, because I tried one soup variety previously, and found it extremely salty.  However, this was on sale, and i had not found a reasonable tomato soup substitute.<br /><br />so, WOW.  i'm so relieved i found this soup. It's delish and rich. The consistency is great (smooth, but with texture) and you can really taste the blend of cream and butter that really complements the tomato to make the overall flavor soooo delicious--almost cheesy (my son asked if I had added parmesan).  it's also a great plus that the ingredients are simple and clean (and organic). I heartily recommend this soup. i certainly will be ordering it from now on using subscribe and save.  Great job, Mr. Puck.

review/summary: The Spice Islands Adjustable Grinder, a Fine Addition to the Table and the Kitchen
review/text: For casual dining, the kind most of us do most of the time, here is a marvelous item for the table or breakfast bar: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M6EP1W">Tone's Spice Islands Disposable Grinder Indian Malabar Peppercorns (Black Pepper Seasoning) Net Weight 6.5 oz</a><br /><br />I love this!  The pepper is fresh with a slight bite.  My friend found this for me, and I was delighted to receive it for a gift. I believe he paid less than this in the store. Although we enjoy many other seasonings, freshly ground black pepper remains our favorite.  It is the perfect spice for white potatoes.  It is great mixed with crushed red pepper. The grinder can be adjusted for fine or coarse texture.<br /><br />These peppercorns are from India's Malabar region and are "noted for superior aroma and robust flavor," as the label says.  The peppercorns are large and uiniform so that they will grind well.<br /><br />If you plan to use a large amount of black pepper in your food, you'll have to work a bit, but if you leave the cap on you can grind pepper and collect a large amount of pepper to be measured and added as you follow recipes.<br /><br />This tall attractive pepper grinder.  is ideal for the table or the kitchen. The grinder is brown, and the bottle is hard clear plastic.<br /><br />I believe you will enjoy using this pepper grinder.

review/text: I like the Spice Islands products and this pepper grinder is a nice addition to the kitchen. It's a disposable grinder so don't expect it to perform like a nice pepper mill. The ability to adjust the grind from coarse to fine is a nice touch. The pepper has a very nice flavor. The major problem comes from the fact that if you like a lot of pepper you'll have to twist quite a few times before enough comes out. Again this is a disposable product so I am not knocking it too much for that.<br /><br />I highly recommend you shop around though. Normally Amazon has the best prices but I found this for about half this price at a local super store.

review/summary: The Best of the Best
review/text: Back in 1959, I sailed to India on my first trip to sea as a Deck Cadet.  We anchored sequentially off several towns along the Malabar Coast, and loaded tons of burlap bags filled with locally produced peppercorns from wooden sailing barges that came out from these coastal towns, and tied up alongside our ship.  At our first of these port calls, the Chief Mate gave me a bunch of empty coffee cans, and told me to go down onto the barges, make notations on any broken or ripped bags, then fill the coffee cans with the spilled Malabar peppercorns, and return the cans directly to him.  I said, "What if none get damaged?"  He replied, "You're learning to be a seaman, and your lesson today is to always carry a knife."  That sparked my curiosity, and I subsequently learned, through extensive sampling around the world, that there is no finer peppercorn than that of the Malabar Coast of India.  Recently, I discovered the Spice Island disposable grinder containing this product and could not have been more delighted.  People who appreciate this marvelous spice can do no better than to have this product handy at every meal at home.  Your first whiff of the aroma will make you a devotee.  It is truly a culinary joy, as well as a "renewable resource" ... thank God!<br />  One further thought:  During my 44 yrs marriage, my sweetheart and I have purchased at least 14 pepper grinders.  Most of them came with a "lifetime guarantee."  Yeah, right.... Try to get your money back when they break down.  Apparently, the guarantee was not for our lifetime, but rather for the lifetime of the grinder itself.  So ... when it broke down, the guarantee was invalidated.  The disposable grinder with this product lasts longer than its supply of peppercorns.  I like that!

review/summary: amazing
review/text: I originally found this Indian Malabar Pepper at Sam's Club.  I absolutely loved it!  When I used it all and tried to find more, I couldn't find it.  No grocery store carries it.  I even asked Publix manager to special order it for me, (no response).  In desperation, I ordered it online.  I'm cheap and didn't want to pay the outrageous price for shipping me pepper.  However, it's worth it.  Once you try this pepper, no other compares.  The flavor is amazing!  I never was much for pepper until I tried this.  I fell in love with it.  :)

review/summary: Good Grinder-Not refillable
review/text: I had both the pepper and salt grinders and was very happy with both until they ran out and I had to throw them away. Be aware they are not refillable. I'm buying refillable grinders now so I dont have to keep buying the whole thing all the time. If you dont mind buying the grinder as well as the pepper every time then these are a good choice. Just gets expensive in the long run, especially if you cook a lot.

review/summary: Pepper Worth a Gift
review/text: I live on a remote Island in Alaska and stumbled on this black gold.  We use pepper like most, but also need it for smoking salmon, seasoning game meats and just making sure our burgers taste decent.  I grow many of my green spices (oregano, basil, chives....etc) but must rely on the local grocer for my other spices.  This pepper has real kick, advise you use it sparingly, but frequently.  It's truly good.  I like it so much that I'll gift it this Christmas to friends who enjoy the real art of cooking, and thought to check Amazon for availability......not terribly surprised to find on their site, but surprised to see I pay 3 dollars less here in Alaska.  No matter, I'll still shop them (Amazon) for gifting this wonderful pepper, but take serious note on pricing disparities.  No matter where you shop this, buy some, check it out and judge for yourself.  I really think you'll appreciate the kick this particular spice provides.  Sadly only only 5 reviews as I type this, but all are 5 star, and so mine as well.  Give it a shot, and take a few minutes to input your thoughts...it's one of the reasons we shop here.....and no, I'm employed in the military, not Amazon.  Take care all, spread a smile wherever you are...it actually matters. And use spices in your cooking!

review/text: I use to purchase Spice Islands at a well known super market, until someone brought them out, and then I looked for them at the new market, but they were not their. So that's when I decided to go on amazon.com. I was so excided that I found the peppercons. I love this product, all the other ones I tried break when they hit the tile floor, but not Spice Islands pepercorns, because they come in a plastic container, I am not worried that I need to spend money on another pepper mill. Thank you, Spice Island.

review/summary: Endless possibilities
review/text: I used these bouncy balls for a senior prank at my school. I had the balls suspended in a bucket above the celling and with a pull of a string the bouncy balls fell down and through a ridged celling tile onto the tile flooring. It was a success, the student body voted it the best prank in the history of the school, very little pick up, and over 100 kids grades 3-11 had a handful of bouncy balls to play with all day.<br />So how much is 2000 bouncy balls? Well the lot of them will fit in a 7.5 gallon bucket, and they weigh about fifty pounds. The bouncy balls have a good bounce more than a 50% bounce back. The verity is quite pleasant, the picture is fitting. I did get one (only one out of 2000) that looked like a pool ball.<br />Also, the price is rather reasonable my class split the price and I only had to pay 14 dollars for my share. That is about 7 cents a ball, afar better price than 25 cents from gum ball machines.

review/summary: Kimbo Vs. Illy Moka (Brown band)
review/text: I live in Sicily and I can tell you that there's no reason to pay $13.80 for the Illy espresso.  This this a great product that many (if not all, come to think of it) of my Italian friends use in their moka espresso makers.  This is great for your afternoon espresso, latte, cappuccino or any other of the american style coffee drinks you wish to make.<br /><br />For those of you who do not know what a moka espresso maker is----it's the espresso maker that goes on your stovetop.  Bialetti makes the best in my opinion---just know that their makers are rated in terms of 2 oz. espresso shots.  Therefore, a 6 cup maker produces a max of 12 oz.  These makers can be used on electric or gas stovetops.  If you have to have the crema form on top of your espresso to be convinced you've produced a quality brew....this is NOT the method of espresso production for you.  You need a high quality machine for that----very pricey.  Italian families use the moka method (for generations) and produce excellent espresso.<br /><br />If you were wondering----yes, you can use this in the machines too!  It will produce the crema as pictured on the can.

review/summary: for mercury detox, easy on the stomach
review/text: I bought this to detox from mercury (bad dental work).  It is an alternative to chlorella which made me so sick I threw up all night.  Yes even the so-called split-membrane chlorella made me just as sick.  EDTA did not make me throw up but made me so nauseous I had to stop taking it.  I had no problem whatsoever with the sodium alginate.  I bought some empty capsules (large), fill them up, and take one or two a day.  From the start my mental clarity has improved.  Without the constant brain fog I can actually plan and get things done.  It is not a miracle improvement but I can tell the difference. I do take cilantro sometimes too which is helping to get it out of the tissues, and then the alginate binds to it to flush it out of the body so it doesn't just recirculate.  I still have one huge filling left which for various reasons I am not ready to have taken out right now.  So I don't want to take huge doses of anything that will start pulling mercury out of the filling.  The sodium alginate is gentle with no side effects. As far as physical symptoms that might be tied into the mercury, they are improving gradually. (Chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, adrenal fatigue.)

review/summary: He loves it, and so do we!
review/text: This dry kibble was the third try in our quest to find a balanced kibble for our Bernese Moutnain Dog. There is plenty of technical information about what to feed your dog and, nearly overwhelmed, we entered the pet food market with an idea of feeding a quality kibble, but chose to avoid high-end designer food, high protein (>26%), bi-products, wheat, soy, and corn. We decided that whole grains, fruits, and vegitables would be an acceptable source of carbohydrates but wanted the ratio to be 40% or less (hard to do when you avoid high protien foods). We also believe chicken is the easiest protein source for our dog to digest. Lastly, we wanted to be near 24% Protien and 14% Fat. Keep in mind that our review below is based on our pet, and every pet will react to food differently.<br /><br />We fed Precise, which was only a great puppy food. We fed Canadae, which resulted in loose stool, gas and a pretty lethargic pet. We did some more research and decided to try Nature's Variety, the result was shocking! Our BMD had ZERO gastric upset during transition and became energetic again. Nature's Variety has produced nearly half the stools, which are small compact and virtually odorless. He has NO gas and his coat is shiny and feels conditioned. People are noticing the change and we couldnt be happier. Add this to the fact that Amazon will ship it to my door with free super saver shipping! Oh, one last thing: The 15lb bags have a decent zipper to lock out air.<br /><br />Thank you for this quality food at a reasonable price.

review/summary: AMAZING Dog Food at a reasonable price.
review/text: We have a mixed breed dog; likely a Walker Coonhound/Great Dane mix. He's a 85-90lb lanky, goofy, lovable example of a canine, but he has a digestive system that is more temperamental than my own weak stomach. As a pup, we had continued him on the original shelter's choice of food for the sake of consistency: Purina Pro Plan, but that food is a misleading, expensive upgrade to a standard grocery store food, which I wanted to get him off of as quickly as possible. From research, and experience, I've found that you either pay for your dog's health through your dog food bill, or through the vet bills that you'll inevitably get from feeding them junk food. We chose the former. We had tried other high quality foods like Wolf King, Solid Gold, and some samples of Wellness.<br /><br />Nature's Variety Prairie, although not their highest level kibble (Instinct), is an affordable and healthy alternative to the low grade grocery store brands. I was unbelievably happy to find this on Amazon now, after feeding this to our dog, Toby, for the past 6 months - and at anywhere from $10 to $5 cheaper than the few pet supply stores near us that sell this brand.<br /><br />I'm not quite as scientific about our choice of food for him as some other reviewers/owners out there, but I did want to keep his diet free of low quality grains/wheat, and disgusting, bottom-of-the-barrel, meat and protein sources. With this food, I know the meat and protein is a primary ingredient (as it should be) and is complimented with healthy fruits, vegetables, minerals, and oils that would theoretically be found in the wild. I would love to begin rotating the food at some point soon to explore his interest in the other meats, specifically lamb.<br /><br />To be blunt for a moment, his stool is now dense, dark, and smaller in quantity than it was with the low grade food he was started on, since the majority of the food is healthy and absorbed through digestion. When he goes, it's not the gamble that it once was when his stomach was being bothered by the junk food full of fillers and unnatural ingredients. His coat is shiny, his energy level is high (maybe too high, haha), and he continues to be the happy, healthy dog that he should be. I owe a lot of this to Nature's Variety, and I'll continue to purchase their food (now through Amazon Prime with two day shipping) as well as their treats, which I bought for the first time yesterday.<br /><br />This food is worth every penny, and it's still cheaper than many of the other high quality holistic foods out there.

review/summary: No More Hotspots!!
review/text: My Golden Retriever has had hotspots all his life. They are definitely food related and once I find a food that works for him, we stick with it. He originally was eating Dr. Andrew Weil's food, Promise, and was very healthy and happy. Well, the company folded and I had to scramble to find dry dog food that was comparable to what he was eating. Prairie matched almost perfectly! He has never had a hotspot while eating Prairie. He loves the food. It even smells good to me and the cat. The cat will eat out of the food bin if I leave it open. She is also a Prairie for Cats fan but that is another review. Now, a word of caution about mixing flavors...mixing flavors is OK if your dog is young and active but be very careful about reading the labels and noting the amount of calories that vary from flavor to flavor. You WILL need to adjust the amount of food!!! I switched to the beef variety and didn't check the calories and was shocked to see how much weight my elderly Golden gained in just one bag of food. Overall, I am very happy with this food and highly recommend it!

review/summary: This one made her sick.....
review/text: Let me start by saying...I am a huge supporter of the Nature's Variety brand.  My cat, Flea, is on instinct and my dog, Mystie, is on prairie dry.  I've tried nearly every variety of both product lines and I love how they have been so great for my fur-kids.  However, when I began to feed the Chicken Prairie to Mystie, she would throw up the food every morning after eating. She hasn't had a history of sensitivity to food and it's a real shame because she LOVES this flavor the most.  It just keeps making her sick.  We have given her the Lamb and Beef versions of this that we have on hand to test and see - but it seems to be only the Chicken that causes an issue.  She does not get sick on any of the other flavors we try.  Let me say again, I love this brand!  However, I felt I should share my experience should there be any other consumers who may be having the same problem with this flavor of Prairie.

review/summary: Reasonably Priced, Cruelty Free, High Protein and High Quality Dog Food
review/text: Nature's Variety is on a very short list of dog food given my requirements: Cruelty Free company, Quality Ingredients, High Protein, and Reasonably Priced. At $45 for a 30 pound bag, it fits the bill. Good luck finding any dog food in this price range that meets these requirements. There are certainly other dog foods with higher protein content, but not at this price. I did have an issue with one of my dogs having excessive gas, but I cured this by slightly adjusting (decreasing) the amount I was feeding him on a daily basis.<br /><br />The ingredients list includes "Montmorillonite" Clay which is naturally occurring and has numerous minerals (it is approved for use by the USDA in organic certified products). Reported benefits include the binding of certain mold-based toxins and even controlling diarrhea. The ingredients also includes probiotics and chelated minerals for improved digestion and immune system function.

review/summary: Top quality dog food, excellent price
review/text: I have been feeding my dogs Nutro for years.  Many times we tried to switch to a different, "better," dog food, but my dog's coat would not look so shiny and they would become ill.  One of my dogs has a very sensitive stomach and she tends to throw up several times a day. It's so common, I've trained her to go outside to puke.  Switching her food seems to make this worse.<br /><br />However, I realize that I have been paying $45 for a 30 lbs bag at the pet store for mediocre at best dog food, so I've been on the hunt for a better, and preferably cheaper, alternative.  I've literally spent days online researching all the different dog foods.  There are many good ones out there, but most of them cost $2 and up a lb.  My food doesn't cost $2 a lb!  This is the only top quality dog food I've found that I can afford.  I'm absolutely certain it is the best value as it is currently $1.27/lb. with subscribe and save.  I also love that I don't have to haul 30 lbs. bags from the store anymore!<br /><br />My dogs love the food.  It does not exacerbate my Sheltie's stomach issue and we save money: almost $10 every month.  Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too!<br /><br />April 15, 2011 update:  My dogs have been on this food for a couple of months now.  My Sheltie's stomach is upset much less often and my short haired dachshund is very noticeably more shiny.  I can't wait until my Sheltie sheds her coat so I can see the new one. One surprising thing is that my dogs eat considerably less of this brand of dog food.  I'm estimating that it's at least 30% less food (and less poop too).  I'm still on the first bag with two small dogs and I used to purchase one (30 lbs) bag of dog food a month before.  I couldn't be more pleased.

review/summary: Great quality food from a trusted company
review/text: This food is not grain free, but the company does commit to making sure the ingredients are mostly meat.  They do not use any grain fragments, which are cheap fillers in many foods.  It has a moderate amount of protein, but I also supplements my dog's diet with some raw meat on a nearly daily basis. My dogs love the flavor of this food and seem to enjoy it a lot. I rotate this with other flavors and the Nature's Variety Grain Free Instinct line as well. I guy this on Amazon.com because the price is really good, especially because I have it set to deliver every two months with Subscribe and Save. This is an all life stages food. Simply feed more to puppies about 4 times a day or once or twice a day to adult dogs. It's healthy food, but your dog can still get fat on it, so don't overfeed.

review/summary: Didn't help hot spots but better overall quality
review/text: One of my dogs has skin allergies and I wasn't sure if it was from Gluten or filler found in other commercial grade dog food.  Someone on here mentioned a dog food analysis Website that rates all dog food ... thank you for that!  I went on there and found that the food they had been eating for the past 3 years was 1-star!  So searched around a little and found that this Prairie food was 5-star (out of 6-star total).  Based on that and the subscribe and save price on amazon and being a prime member it was a done deal for me.<br /><br />I switched their food cold turkey as both my dogs are very large breeds and have no stomach issues.  They took to it right away with no issues.<br /><br />After 1 month of use my dog still had his hot spots and the only thing that seems to work for him is the fish oil pills.  The food didn't do anything in that area.  They both have great coats so I didn't really see a difference.  I just feel better knowing that it has more protein and not so much filler and comes from good ingredients.  Plus it gets shipped right to my door so no complaints here at all.<br /><br />Was going to rate it 4-star due to no immediate noticeable difference but will rate 5-star since the dog food analysis site also gave it 5 -stars for quality ingredients.

review/text: This is a great product.  Keeps my dog's skin allergies under control.  I used this for a year until the price went wayyyyy up.  It has no corn, wheat, or junk, so the increase in the cost of the ingredients cannot be because of the corn shortage.  It went up from $37 to 46.  crazy for 30 pounds of dog food.  southern states coop makes an identical one which is 40 pounds for $30 and they often have coupons for their store.  I switched.  no brainer.

review/summary: Love the dog food but price has increased too much over the past 12 months
review/text: Over the past 3+ years I have fed my dogs 3 different dog foods.  I previously fed my dogs Blue Buffalo lamb but after 7 or 8 months I was not happy with the results and the dogs did not seem to like it very much.<br /><br />I then switched to Natural Balance Dry Dog Food, Grain Free Limited Ingredient, wanting to see if feeding them a grain free product would help with their shedding. After about a year I again was not satisfied with the results (large and soft stool and no help with the shedding).<br /><br />My next dog food was Nature's Variety Prairie.  They like the smaller dry kibble and I liked the technical information about what to feed them, looking for a certain range of protein and fat by using an independent dog food advisor site. Also, through my research I noted that Nature's Variety was noted to add probiotics to enhance a dog's digestive functions and also include certain minerals that make them easier to absorb.<br /><br />Enough technical though.  My dogs really like Nature's Variety Prairie and their stool has improved.  Shedding is still an issue and both my vet and groomer say some dogs just shed regardless of what you feed them.  My dogs have been eating Nature's Variety Prairie for the past year.<br /><br />I have 2 very large mixed breed rescue dogs so we do go through a lot of food each month.  I love getting it from Amazon on subscribe and save mainly because the price was right for a very good quality food and it arrives at my door with free shipping and without me having to think about it at all.  My dogs eat slightly more than 30 pounds each month so every 3 months I need to order an extra bag so I never run out.<br /><br />Yesterday I went online at Amazon to place my extra order I was surprised to see how the price has increased over the last few months, going from $37.90 in May to $43.17 in August to its current $49.38 in September.  This price has now increased to more than I can buy it locally and I no longer have the tax free in California.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I will either change again or just buy the food locally since I do like Nature's Variety.  I am considering one of Merrick's dry foods as I like the fat-to-protein ratio of about 50% but I hate the gradual process of switching dog food.

review/summary: Great dog food on paper but dog will NOT EAT!
review/text: I researched many brands, and read reviews and was happy with this choice, as it sounded great/healthy/quality food for my rescued dog.  We switched off of the Science Diet, to this... slowly.  My dog ate every morsel it could find of the Science Diet leaving all of this behind.  So when we went fully over to this dog food, she went on a hunger strike!  She wouldn't eat it at all, so we added some meat juice and then she'd eat.  She is NOT a picky dog at all.  So now we've switched her to California Naturals Herring and Sweet Potato, and she devours her food.  In the switch over part, I actually witnessed her grab some of this kibble and then spit it back out to go for the California Natural.<br /><br />My other complaint is the kibble size is TINY.  These are NOT chunks that dogs can bite into and chew.  This is almost as small as cat food.  So if you had a dog that ate fast, this would just be inhaled.<br /><br />Good intentions and sounded great on paper, but taste was a resounding NO from our adopted pooch.

review/summary: So far I'm impressed
review/text: When I adopted my dog, she was 9 months old, and on Diamond Naturals Lamb & Rice puppy and her foster mom recommended she stay on it.  I bought one large bag of it which lasted about a month, or maybe even 6 weeks.  The dog was doing okay on it but she didn't seem terribly interested in the food.  Many meals sat untouched and although she would eat when she really got hungry, she is an incredibly active dog and I was concerned she wasn't getting enough to eat.  So when that bag was gone, I reverted to a cheaper food that we had fed our previous dog.  She liked this better but it didn't take long to notice how much she pooped on it.  I'm talking EVERY time she went outside she both peed and pooped and that seemed excessive.  Also, we had to start watching her closely or she would turn around and eat what she had just discarded.  Ewww.  I know some dogs do this but....then she'd come in and lick me and I was totally grossed out.  The breath smelled pretty awful too.<br /><br />So - back to the drawing board.  For the first time I actually did some research into dog nutrition and ingredients and spent literally hours analyzing lots of different foods.  In these tough economic times, I simply can't afford to pay $5/pound for dog food, when I'm scrimping and saving to feed my family on the cheap.  I do care about my dog though and wanted to feed her the best food I could afford to feed.<br /><br />When I found this, it seemed to meet the criteria - a higher quality food that has meat as the first ingredient (instead of corn or soy or wheat), but didn't require that I take out a loan to buy it.  I've had it a week or so but wanted to finish up the bag of feed we're on first so it doesn't go to waste.  Yesterday, as I watched her poop for the 6th time in almost as many hours, it occurred to me that I could go ahead and switch her right away since our other dog doesn't have the pooping issue, so can finish up the cheap stuff.  Last night I opened the Prairie and immediately had my dog's attention.  She lay down and polished off the entire bowl without once leaving to see if the other dog had something better, as she typically does.  When she finished the kibble, she licked the bowl clean.  I let them both outside and as soon as she came back in, she ran over to the bowl to lick it again and check that there wasn't a crumb she had missed the first time around.  Honestly, I've never seen her this enthusiastic about a food before.<br /><br />So I think I've found a winner: I'm pleased with the ingredient list and the cost, and my dog loves the taste.  It is too early to tell if it solves the pooping issue but I will update with that in a week or so.  For now, I'm super pleased.

review/summary: Excellent Dog Food
review/text: I am buying the second bag of the Prairie food for my 18 months old German Shepherd Dog. I started him out on a different brand of dog food, as an 8 week old puppy. He grew very fast eating that one and then the vet switched him to adult dog food at the age of 6 months to slow down his growing (to avoid joint problems). He didn't like that one very much, so I tried a different one which he wasn't too fond of either. After reading all the favorite reviews for this dog food, I bought it for my GSD this past spring. I like the fact that it is made of natural ingredients and most of all I like the chicken and rice ingredients in it. My dog has a sensitive stomach (like most of the GSDs do) and, whenever he has to take medicine, he ends up having a bad case of diarrhea. When that happens, I feed him steamed chicken with white rice to stop the diarrhea (vet's advice). My dog has been  enjoying his first bag of Prairie food and I am buying him the second one before he runs out of it. Purebred dogs need an excellent nutrition in order to strive and stay healthy, and I think I found the right food for mine.<br /><br />My dog is now 2 years old and he loves his Prairie with chicken meal and brown rice. I once tried to switch him to a different dog food and, as my vet put it "he went on a hunger strike." He refused to eat that other dog food. I had to order the Prairie dog food with next day delivery because my dog didn't eat for several days. I gave him milk bones treats just so that he had something in his stomach. So Prairie has been his food for most of his life since it is the one and only one he wants.

He has had absolutely no health issues. Shiny coat, no infections.  A good food like this is a little pricey but well worth it.  In the past, I've fed dogs cheaper foods but they would end up with ear infections, hot spots and dry coats.<br />I use Amazon's automatic delivery feature and this big, heavy bag is delivered right to my door on a schedule that works for me!

review/summary: Well worth the extra money
review/text: First, go to this website: [...]<br />Look for the rating section, and find the food that you are feeding your dog or cat right now, (they have a cat food link). Look for the ratings, and see what your food is rated. Then go up to the next rating, and see if you can find a better quality brand, for about the same price (this is exactly how I found a better rated brand). Do the research, and see what you can do to, get your pet the best possible rating, that you can AFFORD. Keep in mind too, that with less fillers, your dog will get more use out of the food, and it actually goes further than the cheap foods. The doggie waste is also much less in the yard. AND,,,lets just say that he has a much smaller problem with room clearing gas problems, when eating a premium food.<br /><br />This brand is one of the few that gets a five star rating on [...] - this website has proved to be indispensable for help in picking out a decent food for our dogs, but nothing is fool proof, when it comes to how that food is produced, and that is the fault of the government not having enough oversight over what can be put into the food. It is sad, because our pets deserve better. After using a "premium brand" food brand Iams, for year, I was very sad to learn how terrible the food actually was/is for the high price. Again,,,you don't have to purchase THIS brand, but get the best food for the money that you can afford for them. Having a website like Amazon, is actually the most helpful because just about EVERY brand mentioned on the dog food site, can be purchased and delivered to your door - something for me that is well worth, not having to lug around that huge bag.<br /><br />Yes it  [this brand], is expensive. However, in light of all of the Salmonella outbreaks happening to even the BEST of dog food companies, (like Buffalo), I chose this company, because they have not had a recall on their products, that I could track down. I was using Premium Plus (another expensive brand,,but they have had a few recalls, for unclean factories and fungal tainted batches). If you are like us, your pets are no less important to you, than your children. Truthfully, unless we hand cook everything for our dogs, we have no control over the way the food is made, or what goes into it. Sadly, there is also no oversight, as to what they are allowed to put into that food. This often includes any and all scraps and pieces of whatever "animal product", that will be the base protein, being used for that type of food, (any of these scraps qualifies for "meat").<br />Because of the recalls on so many brands, I still keep a watchful eye on the company, and hope that they keep up their standards for a clean facility, on a regular basis, to try and keep up with the quality and safety of his food, to the best of my ability. Better to be safe than sorry with a sick pup. Or worse yet losing him to a food born illness caused by tainted food.<br /><br />Be warned though, if you have a very large breed dog, the kibble size on this brand, is EXTREMELY small! We have since put his food into a "Kong Feeder" that he has to roll around, to get the food out, which forces him to, take his time in eating it. If we didn't do this, he would totally gulp down an entire bowl, within minutes, often getting sick, because it was not chewed up at all.

There are just two problems, the price literally jumped like $10 a bag and our dogs aren't digesting this well.<br />We recently moved to a much smaller house with a less secure yard, and as a result the dogs are spending a lot more time with us indoors and we have to walk them everyday twice. I noticed that they were constantly farting and their stool was loose. Honestly, I'm a little disappointed. It took a lot of time and research to find a all around good dog food, but I can't argue with their stomachs.

review/summary: Best Dog Food on the Market.. Period
review/text: I have had several dogs over the years and now am fortunate to have a Rottweiler and a Pomeranian.  I say both of the breeds only for the purpose of showing the ability for this food to span not only drastically in breeds but size as well.<br /><br />With that said, this is the only dog food that my dogs literally love to eat that is HEALTHY.  And that is a huge point especially considering that both of my dogs health are a primary concern considering the nature of what they do for a living e.g. Service Dogs<br /><br />A great additional to being just dog food, it doubles as a healthy treat.  I generally use frozen billjack dog food for a treat, but that is not always the best to use in the heat or really in any situation that is not for immediate consumption.  With that said, this dog food is tasty enough for my dogs that they go nuts for it while performing training.  It is likely a combination of gratification for pleasing me and taste for them.  Either way I jokingly refer to it as "puppy crack" for my dogs mainly because they literally can't get enough.<br /><br />That brings to the cons- It is important to watch a dogs weight and maintain a healthy lifestyle with your dog.  It is easy to just fill up a bowl and leave it and let your dogs eat.  And if done with this food, your dogs will eat the heck out of it which is a con in if consumption is more than what is recommended by a veterinarian.<br /><br />And don't let the price scare you away.  If you wouldn't feed your kids fastfood everyday then don't skimp for your dogs!<br /><br />***ALSO GET TO SAVE 15% IF YOU SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE!!!<br />Seriously a sweet deal!!!

They couldn't bring it home sooner because the puppy was just too young and I guess at that point they want to make sure all the shots and paperwork are in order.  This is going to be a fantastic day!  Anyway this Nature's Variety Prairie Dry Dog Food is going to be the main dish I serve to our puppy, but perhaps he's too young to eat it just yet.  I'm not sure.  I'll have to check out the size of the chunks.  I want to make sure the puppy can digest the food properly, haha.  One thing's for sure- when you raise your dog on the dried food, they won't be mooching for table scraps!

We have been using this food for our two dachshunds for almost a year now & they seem to really like it.  I prefer the chicken version mainly for their weight control.
