review/summary: Excessive Packaging
review/text: I tried this item for the first time after having purchased from Walmart. I thought it would be good, especially I noticed an "award" emblem on the front of the package. After opening and trying this product, I don't really know what that award was truly for. Being very environmentally conscious, I feel that the packaging is too excessive, the rusks are individually wrapped in non-recyclable something(?), and all the individual packets are packaged in non recyclable plastic film, all contained in a carboard box. I also didn't realize that this was made in China at the time I purchased it (I was in a hurry). My 9 month old can't eat these right now - I will go back to other dissolvable foods like "puffs" for now. My four year old, however, wants to eat these more than my 9 month old and since my four year old is so skinny, these are not the ideal snacks for her either, since they don't have much nutritional value if you read the side of the box. I love Amazon, but I would never order this particular item from them and I would not reccommend this item to new parents.

review/summary: Made in China & No nutritional value
review/text: I went to BRU today to buy these after seeing how great a 6 month old was able to handle them. Every time I give my son a teether biscuit (Gerber or Earth's Best), he ends up chewing off a huge chunk and almost choking.  The 6 month old who was eating these today had no choking problems because they melt.  I was so excited to buy these.  As I was walking to the register, I saw that they are made in China. Also, if you look at the ingredients, they have nothing of any value in them.  Just empty calories...no protein, no vitamins, no fiber, no nothing.

review/summary: choking hazard for little ones
review/text: I've been looking at all the local grocery stores for teething biscuits for my 7 month old daughter. When I didn't find any there, I ordered a case of these. Unfortunately it's a total waste of money. I tried giving them to my daughter twice and both times she instantly broke off a piece that was perfect choking size. They're too easily broken to be good gnawing biscuits, and don't melt in the mouth fast enough to overcome that problem. It's back to the drawing board for me while whole boxes of these sit unused. For what it's worth, they're also really bland flavored.

review/summary: Made in China - NOT worth the risk
review/text: While these seems tasty and have a good texture, they are made in China. Despite what the manufacturer or anyone else says, while I might let my child play with a toy or wear clothes made in China, I would not let my child ingest any food made in China.  My colleagues at work have visited with manufacturers of all types of products in China (including food) and based on what I have heard from their first hand accounts as well as the known incidents such as melamine milk, I would not let my baby put food made in China is his mouth.  Sorry, not worth the risk in my opinion.

review/summary: Made in CHINA!
review/text: I'll buy clothing and electronics if it's made in China, but NO WAY I'll food - it's just too risky. Even some of the middle class there have started their own farming because they know they can't trust the government to regulate food safety... So, I'm hugely disappointed to learn that about these especially since I love how my little one is happy to be able to hold the cracker by herself. Won't be buying any more of these!

review/summary: My son likes these
review/text: This is what my wife wrote about these on her blog:<br />Pros: Great as a first finger food, low choking risk, tastes good, not very messy, packaged conveniently for on-the-go snack, does not contain wheat.<br />Cons: Not sold in most supermarkets (have only found them at Walmart and Sam's Club and on Amazon.com), caused me temporary panic b/c they are made in China and contain skim milk powder BUT there seems to be no cause for concern.<br /><br />I've been giving Baby Mum-Mum rice crackers to SB as a snack since he was about 7 months old, and it was love at first bite. I taste all the stuff I give to SB to see how edible they are, and I have to say that they are pretty darn tasty. The crackers are very light and airy and sort of melt in your mouth as you chew (or mash in SB's case). They have a lightly sweet taste that makes them easy to eat. The box contains 12 conveniently wrapped packages of 2 crackers each - perfect for sticking in your diaper bag for snack time on the go.<br /><br />After SB's bottom front teeth came in at about 6.5 months, I started looking for a teething cracker or biscuit that doesn't have wheat in it (I read that it's better to wait until baby is 9-12 months old before introducing wheat due to the allergy risk) and couldn't find anything in the grocery aisles, surprisingly. Then I came across Baby Mum-Mums at my local Walmart, which are made of rice, not wheat. Although Baby Mum-Mums aren't exactly a teething cracker, they were close enough for me. I mainly wanted something that SB could practice biting and chewing on. They've turned out to be the perfect starter finger food.<br /><br />Initially, I would hold the cracker for SB as he chomped on it, but after a little encouragement, he started taking the cracker in his own hand and feeding himself. Yay, his first successful attempt at finger food self-feeding! The crackers were great for giving him finger food practice, since they are easy for his little hands to clasp and big enough for him to find his mouth with it. As you can see from the picture, they have a long oval shape and are pretty thin, so it's easy to bite off pieces. And they don't create much mess at all - a few crumbs here and there. I've found them to be a great distraction for SB when he gets fussy on car rides or in his stroller.<br /><br />There are a lot of things to like about Baby Mum-Mums. The box highlights the following:<br /><br />-No Artificial Colors or Flavors<br />-No Preservatives<br />-Gluten, Egg & Peanut Free<br />-Baked, Low in Fat & No Trans Fat<br />-No Added Fats or Oils<br /><br />But there is another important thing to note about these crackers. They are made in China AND contain milk powder. About a week after the melamine-tainted milk scandal came to light in China, it suddenly hit me that my SB's beloved Baby Mum-Mums might be one of the foods affected by the tainted milk. I went straight to the web to see what information I could dig up on Mum-Mums and the melamine issue, and...it seems that they are safe. A big sigh of relief. This is what I found:<br /><br />Statement from National Importers (importer/distributor of the product): This basically states that Mum-Mums contain milk powder imported from New Zealand and that food authorities in China, Australia, Canada, and the US have tested batches of Mum-Mums with results all coming back negative for melamine contamination.<br /><br />The full post:  sammybearsays.blogspot.com/2008/10/baby-mum-mum-rice-rusks.html

review/summary: good brand from Taiwan
review/text: My husband and I came from Taiwan and have been living in the US for over 15 years. Normally we only buy Chinese snacks that are brand names and made in US or Taiwan. However, I was very glad to find this product in Amazon even though I just bought it today and haven't yet received it. I do know "Hot Kid" very well and used to have it for snack growing up in Taiwan. It was one of my few favorite snacks made by a well reputed Taiwanese company. I trust this brand just as I do General Mills or Kraft. It was already a major food company in Taiwan back then and "rice rusk" was the most popular product. Now, this company has made its way to becoming one of the three biggest food companies in China. Interesting enough, these three companies are all Taiwanese companies. I think the main reason is that people in China do not trust their own brands. I believe that "Hot Kid"is a quality food product. I think the worry is overdone and the red flag is unnecessary. My son is 7 months now and it was a pleasing surprise to have found this product in US.

review/summary: I heart mum-mum
review/text: Oh my, as the mother of the world's crankiest teether, I should have been on the lookout for something like this. Honestly, I'm smacking myself in the forehead for not trying mum-mums earlier. Because my son? He loves him some mum-mum. They let him happily gnaw away before dissolving into non-choking hazard goo, and this kid has been pretty unimpressed with all those other teething products out there. I know because I own them all. Seriously, all of them. Sophie? Berry teether? Water ring teether? Bead teether? Mesh feeder-teether thing? Ice cube in a washcloth? They're all garbage in my sons eyes. Some asian rice rusks with a funny name=LOVE.<br /><br />Pros: I can find them at my local Walmart. They're perfectly portioned with two to a package (like poptarts), and they're easily tossed into a diaper bag. I break them in half before handing them off to my son, but that's just because he has a tendency to randomly chuck things out his stroller, and this keeps him from wasting an entire precious mum-mum. I personally think they taste pretty good (I haven't tried the other flavors). Also, they're cheap, much cheaper than all those teething products I just listed up there.<br /><br />Cons: While somewhat sturdy, they are not crush proof, as evidenced by the large amount of mum-mum dust in my purse. They hold up much better if given their own diaper bag compartment, rather than tossed in with all the rest of your stuff. Also, while they dissolve into goo, that goo is gross, and it is super sticky as it dries. Nothing a couple of baby wipes can't fix, and fortunately, the goo doesn't stain.

review/summary: Nutrition Informatoin Needs to be Updated
review/text: The nutrition information is not what is on the box. The box does not list skim milk powder as an ingredient but does say that the product may contain traces of milk. I tried giving it to my 6 month old. She liked chewing on the rusk and only gagged a couple of times. However, it must contain milk because she is milk-protein intolerant and had a rash on her face and behind that evening. Too bad I can't return the other 5 boxes.

review/summary: Not Just For Babies
review/text: I first discovered this product while stocking the baby food aisle of my local Wal-Mart where I work. I'm always on the look-out for low fat, low carb products and this fits the bill. There are 12 foil wrapped Mum-Mums containing 2 crispy wafers each measuring 4 1/2 by 1 1/2 inches.A serving is two of these easy to open packets,just zip them open from top to bottom along the side. They dissolve easily in your mouth and are still sturdy enough to spread peanut butter between for a sandwich that even a toddler would love, or top with tuna or egg salad without getting soggy. Great as a salsa dipper.They are bland taste wise but they're made of rice and they're a healthy alternative.

review/summary: Gluten free snack!!
review/text: As other reviewers say, these are great.  My baby loves them, they're not very messy and they're cheap!  The Amazon price is the same as the price at our nearby Walmart.  However, both Amazon and Walmart are frequently sold out of these because they are so popular.  So, stock up when they are available.<br /><br />Another plus (for us anyway) is that they are gluten free.  It is extremely hard to find good snack/finger foods for babies that don't have wheat flour in them.  Additionally, I've found that any that didn't have wheat usually had corn instead, which I'm also a little wary to give my baby for the first year at least.  These are just rice!  They are perfect.  I can't recommend them enough.

review/summary: Best infant/toddler snack!
review/text: As a mom of four, I probably should've bought stock in Gerber considering how many Puffs we've gone through in the past 5 years.  I noticed these while shopping at Target and gave them to my son as his first self-fed food at about 7 mos. and he absolutely loved them.  He is now 10 mos. and prefers these to any other snack, including puffs.  They are easy to hold, dissolve quickly, don't leave too much mess, and are conveniently packaged in packs of 2 (great to toss in your bag).  I would highly recommend this to any mom.  They are hard to find in most supermarkets so I'm thrilled that Amazon has them now and at such a good price.

review/summary: Great Beginner Food
review/text: I am so glad I gave these a try.  At first I got scared over the comments about them being made in China, but I checked the company website and did some research, and these seem to be more carefully monitored and tested than most baby food available in the states.  My baby is a bit behind in areas, with feeding being one of them.  I couldn't get him to even try self feeding, even though he is nine months.  Enter Baby Mum Mums...not only does he like them (I've tried them, they have a very mild slightly sweet taste), but he was able to hold onto them and self feed. Within days he was feeding himself smaller items such as Cheerios and yogurt bites as well.  Yeah!!! They melt quite easily so I do not worry about choking and as long as I monitor him he does better with these than any other food he can feed himself with.  However, always watch your baby while feeding these as there have been some babies who choked because they ate too much too fast and it gelled up in their throats--they can get somewhat sticky and dry.  My baby and I give mum mums 2 thumbs up! Also, Amazon's price can't be beat and I love having them delivered right to my door.

review/summary: great product, watch expiration date!
review/text: My kids love baby mumums like you wouldn't believe.  So it was a no brainer when it came to buying them at a great price on Amazon (free super saver shipping...).  Knowing that when i buy them in the store, they have about a one year shelf life, I wasn't worried about not going through an entire case of them in that time.  To my surprise, the box must have been sitting in Amazon's wherehouse for a long time, because BOTH cases (the veggies rusks and original rice rusks) were manufactured in AUGUST 2007, expiring in August 2008.  Yup, this is the mont of May 2008...  so i now had 2 months to get my 9 month old and 2 year old to eat 48 packs of baby mum mums!!!!  wow.  Called Amazon, they sent 2 more cases.  same deal, same dates.  They say as long as they aren't expired, they can't control the dates of expiration for you.  bummer.  I am now in the possession of way to many baby mumums.  thankfully, I have a lot of friends with little ones..... they are great for the teething baby.  very crunchy. not as messy as teething biscuits! Amazon was very quick to try to help out and I give them credit for their understanding.  Just watch those expiration dates... ;)

review/text: We started giving my daughter Mum mums at about 4 months of age. They were the only thing we were not afraid she would choke on, as they dissolve instantly. It also helped her learn how to feed herself and, before she had excellent dexterity, she could hold Mum mums herself because they were so large and easily graspable. My daughter is ten-months old now and still loves Mum mums. She knows the packaging and gets excited if you simply show her a pack of them. I would recommend these for growing infants over any other products.

review/summary: Baby Rusks
review/text: Our 14 month old twin daughters loved these rusks when we were living in NZ, fast forward 2 weeks and we're living in Riyadh with no gluten-free baby products available. Luckily we were able to buy from Amazon and have shipped here to Riyadh. Whole process only took 6 days, so will definitely be ordering again. So much easier to order a box of 6-packs rather than previously buying from supermarket every few days back in NZ. For anyone unfamiliar with this product, the rusks turn soggy yet hold shape when they come into contact with liquids (i.e. saliva), so they were safe for our bubbies right from the start of solids introduction. The shape is a long wide oval, so easy to snap in half when appetites are small, yet come in two-packs wrapped in foil, so easy to keep fresh. The texture is kind of like foam, so no crumbs to clean up and therefore easy to eat when out for a meal.

review/summary: Love them
review/text: I got a sample of these from a friend for my 6m son.  He LOVED them.  He doesn't like the puffs or other first 'solid' snacks because he chokes on them and they don't melt fast enough.  This was perfect.  He can hold the food himself so it doesn't slip down his throat.  It melts very quickly once it's in his mouth to prevent choking.<br /><br />As a mom, I love these.  They are PERFECT for when you have a little one that gets cranky watching everyone else eat.  When the whole family goes out to a restaurant we put him in the high chair and give him one of these rice snacks when the food is served.  It keeps him occupied and happy and lets everyone else enjoy their food while it's hot instead of playing 'pass the baby' and taking turns eating.<br /><br />Just ordered a bunch on Amazon.  They are also sold at Target and Wal-Mart.  I haven't tried any flavors with him other than the original and Banana.  Can't wait to buy some of the others and see what he thinks of them.  This is a wonderful product.... Oh and its Gluten free!! :)

review/summary: Mum Mums are great for young eaters
review/text: Great snack for young eaters.  These are tasty, and interesting, for my almost one year old, she loves to "bite" foods and is avoiding baby foods, but still loves MumMums.  Started giving them at about 4 months old, and never had any issues with choking.  A really great snack, that does NOT make a big mess.

review/summary: My 6 month old teething, food craving angel loves these!
review/text: My 6 month old broke through two bottom teeth, began chewing on anything and everything I let her get her hands on and also would scream and cry when we started eating our meals everyday.  I was too scared to buy her teething biscuits for fear she would choke if she bit off a piece.  So, I found these and tried them out.  These Rice Rusks dissolve instantly almost and keep me worry free as she grabs a hold of them and eats them with out my help.  I still hold her and watch her of course, but she loves the freedom of holding them herself and chomping down on them.  They are also really tasty.  The original taste sweet, the banana taste like banana and I haven't tasted the vegetable one yet.  I have recommended this to my friends and gone on and on about how much she loves them. If you decided to try these out, I hope your baby enjoys them as much as mine does.  Also, shop around for prices they seem to overprice at certain stores.

review/summary: Love Mum-Mums
review/text: I have tried teething biscuits with my eldest child when she was an infant, and boy were they ever a mess. Not so with mum-mums. I won't say there is NO mess at all. I started giving these to my second daughter on the recommendation of a relative. She had just started sitting up unsupported -- about five months old. At first, she made a bit of a mess with them because she would drop them and pick them back up, drool all over them, etc. Now that she is seven months old, she really has the hang of the rice rusks, and although she does manage to get a bit here or there stuck to her clothing, she can self-feed herself and be done in a jiffy. (Which makes it less of an activity, but oh well. She loves them.)<br /><br />We tried the banana flavored mum-mums and they did seem to make a bit more mess than the originals.<br /><br />Rice rusks weigh about the same as air. They feel kind of like a rice cake. They don't smell like anything (well, the banana ones do, I guess). But the baby likes them a lot, and they are very handy to take along when traveling or shopping.

review/text: We love love love the Baby Mum-mums. My son (9 months) bites into them and cracks them off the way an adult would bite into a candy bar. They are fairly flavorless (like a rice cake) and dissolve easily (like a puff), but they are so much more portable than a puff. We couldn't get through life without them!

review/summary: We love them, but a lot are broken
review/text: Mum mums are easy to feed our infant- he can do it himself! He stuffs these things in!<br /><br />They can get a little messy (like all infant food) and stick into things when wet.  If you clean them up while wet- no problem- but if they dry into clothes or the carpet they are pain.<br /><br />They taste pretty good (better than infant cereal!)and even my toddler asks for them- and in a pinch I've snacked on a few too.<br /><br />The only problem-  the packaging.  I ordered them by the 6 box case and more than half the crackers are broken.  The box was just the individual boxes of rusks in a cardboard case-- no padding.<br />Its very frustrating because the long shape is one of the reasons they are so easy for my 6 month old to feed himself. The pieces end up dropped much more easily than the original shape.<br /><br />Overall rating for the product= 5<br />for the condition in which they arrived- 3.

review/summary: The whole family loves these
review/text: I just love these rice rusks.  I found them when my older son was a baby and he continues to love them to this day (he is four).  I always have them in the house because they are perfect for a light snack (not too filling), provide a satisfying crunch, and are *just* sweet enough.  My 16 month old loves them as well.  As a mom, I like them because they don't really crumb as much as a traditional cracker - though they do tend to break easily.  The cleanup is easier if they DO break.  Amazon.com has a great deal with the case as well, we usually order them every other month or so.

review/summary: Baby Mum Mum
review/text: My son (15 mo.) and daughter (3 y/o) both LOVE Mum Mums. We first tried these with my daughter when we started looking for teething biscuits. She had one teething biscuit, which made a nasty orange mess all over her and her clothes, AND a big piece broke off which she choked on. After that, I threw the rest of the box away. I then found Mum Mums, and they have been a fixture in our house/car/diaper bag/stroller since. We lovingly refer to these rice cakes as a "little piece of our sanity." When the kids were first on finger foods, they would slowly munch on these while we fixed meals or were waiting on our meals at restaurants. They disolve, so if a little piece breaks off, it's not a big deal. Their shape is good for little hands that are learning to get food to their mouths. As they have gotten older, they simply enjoy them as snacks. I buy these by the case, and I give a box to my friends as their kids get to that stage where they are wanting to feed themselves. 5 STARS!!!!!

review/text: This was my son's first finger food and at 10 months remains his favorite.  It is great for when you are on the go.  It isn't messy because it is one big piece rather then other traditional finger foods that are small pieces that get all over the stroller, car seat, and the ground.  This is easy for him to hold and feed himself from day one.  Great product!

review/summary: great first finger food
review/text: When my grandson was teething he desperately wanted something to chew, but anything we gave him he would break off a bite and choke on it.  Mum Mums disolve in their litle mouths, especially since they are drooling so much anyway.  I could give him a Mum Mum and he was so happy, especially when we were in restaurants and he wanted food to eat too. Naturally you have to watch children when they eat but the chance of choking with these is slim to none.  And even better their little faces are not covered with cookie slime that dries like concrete.

I recommend this snack over the normal mushy stuff that's out there even though this is not a good teething biscuit.  Granddaughter likes to practice biting so this is great.  We don't have to worry about choking; it melts fairly quickly in the mouth.  Enjoy. It comes in different flavors too.

Ony gripe would be that they are very delicate and tend to break into tiny pieces when toting them aorund in my diaper bag. no big deal though. Oh, and they are hard to find....walmart has them but not consistently so I just order them in bulk on amazon

review/summary: Be careful - they're addictive for babies AND moms!
review/text: I recently found these rice rusk cookies at my local WalMart, and was immediately drawn to the fact that they are nearly the only thing I could find for babies that does not contain any wheat, which I am trying to limit in my toddler son's diet.  The easily-graspable size and loud CRUNCH were an instant hit with him, and I have no qualms about handing him one without the necessity of watching him like a hawk to be sure he doesn't choke on it.<br /><br />I like to try the stuff I feed to my baby so I know what it tastes like, which turned out to be a mistake with these... because I love them!  They are light and airy, mildly sweet and browned just a tiny bit which adds to the flavor.  I now find myself looking for excuses to 'help him finish them up' (i.e. Now that the package has been opened, they'll go stale in the next 15 minutes if they're not all eaten right now!)<br /><br />I have a friend whose 9 month old is ready to try chewable foods, but mom is too afraid she will choke - I'm going to recommend these to help the transition proceed safely!  I was disappointed to find only two boxes left on the shelf during my last shopping trip, so signed up for Amazon's subscription service.

review/text: This is a great product and treat.  My son loves the fact that he can hold onto the biscuit and devour the rusk.  It has a similar dissolving consistency as gerber puffs but are great for some of my sons little friends who can't have gluten

review/summary: Great melt-in-mouth cracker!!!
review/text: I found these while I was visiting in Florida. My 9 month old loved them! They are easy to handle and melt in his mouth quickly, so no fear of getting a large piece stuck. He can break off a large piece, but he just sucks on it for a few seconds and it's soft enough to manage. Once back in MA, I couldn't find them in any of our grocery stores, so I ordered a case on Amazon. I have no doubt that he will eat all 12 boxes in the nex couple of months. We are tyotally sold on Mum-Mums!

review/summary: Baby Mum Mum's are not only for babies!!
review/text: When my daughter purchased this new item for my 8 month old grandson, little did she know she was finding his 58 year old Grammaw a wonderfully edible gluten free food also.Once I tasted them I immediately purchased 2 boxes for myself. I have Celiac Disease, as does my 5 yr. old granddaughter, and my grandson has not been able to tolerate gluten thus far either, so this is a treasure for all of us to find. They are difficult to find, and am so grateful to see them on Amazon! They certainly are not only for babies in this family. They are absolutly scrumptious with gluten free ready to use cheesecake filling spread on them, and I am going to try dipping them in melted semi sweet chocalate with a hint of peppermint extract, and then I will try a thin layer of peanut butter spread on them before dipping in semi sweet chocolate .... as far as I can tell .... there is no end to their use for me! I am so happy to find them on here, so that my 5 year old granddaughter can try them also!

review/text: These "cookies" are the best for your little one that is learning to feed hand to mouth.  They are able to gum it around in their mouths and it dissolves pretty quickly.  I like them because they don't make a huge mess like biter biscuits or zwiebeck toast.  They are a great little snack and they don't go stale the day after you open the package.  If I could give them 6 stars, I would!

review/summary: The Perfect First Snack
review/text: Mum Mums were my son's favorite snack as a baby, so I was bummed to learn that my local grocers no longer stock them.  Thanks to Amazon for coming to my rescue!<br /><br />These are wonderful snacks for babies just learning to feed.  Because they are thin and dissolve in the mouth very quickly, babies are less likely to choke on them than the teething treats you typically see in stores.  I began feeding Mum Mums to both my son and my daughter within a few days of starting them on rice cereal and have never had them choke on one.  I also love that they are much less messy than other baby treats.

review/text: I found these crackers in the baby food aisle at my local supermarket while looking for a nutritious, easy to chew, snack for my 12 month old. Because my son had not cut many teeth, at that time, it was important to find something that he could chew easily.  Needless to say, my son is now 14 months old and completely addicted to them.  They are crispy, but dissolve easily in the mouth.  He loves the crunchy noise that the crackers make.  I whole-heartedly recommend this high quality product.  The crackers are well worth the price.

review/text: After reading all of the great reviews, I purchased these for my daughter.  Unfortunately I couldn't just buy one box, so I have way too many of these!  I like that they are light and safe for babies to eat.  However, the ones that I purchased were unflavored.  My 10 month old does not like them at all.  She'll play with them and then throw them on the floor.  This was a complete waste of money for me! Thankfully they weren't very expensive.  Maybe I would have had better luck if I had purchased these when she was 6 months old or if I had purchased a flavored brand.  I would advise you not to purchase these for babies older than 8 months.  If you do purchase them, you may want to consider the flavored ones.

review/text: My son is 6 months old and I was so happy to find this product. I thought it would be like farley's rusks but it's more like a wafer. I tried it before giving it to him. It does not melt in the mouth on contact. This 'rusk' can easily break or be squished by a 6 month old. Thinking that my baby will have a better experience I gave it to him and he was biting on it like a teether and a small piece broke in his mouth. I quickly took it out as I could see that it was a hard piece and it failed to melt in the mouth on contact. I will return this so called rusk and get Farley's rusks instead.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: I have 3 different flavors on these and they are : jalape&ntilde;o , apple wood ,a and hickory. I so far think hickory has the best smoke taste but apple wood has more bacon flavor. Jalape&ntilde;o is good but not the best . All these products do and will add complex flavor to your food. They add great smoke and subtle bacon flavor. You can smell the bacon and taste it on most foods. I think it is the best on chicken. I disagree with the people that say there is hardly any bacon flavor and I think you guys have poor palates. Do not expect this to make your food taste like it was wrapped by 90 pieces of bacon for Pete's sake! No seasoning is meant to achieve this level of flavor and if you want full bacon taste then buy bacon and eat it! But JD's bacon products are amazing and my wife and I love it on most BBQ meats and I like to add it to chili's and anything you wish to add extra flavor to. Highly recomended and it will always be in my spice cupboard .

The applewood flavor is not very strong but that is fine with me because it has an excellent bacon flavor. I use it as the secret ingredient in my steak seasoning. Mix it with some kosher salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and a dash of cayenne and BAM!!!! Everything is better with bacon salt!

review/summary: Where is the applewood smoke and bacon flavor ?
review/text: I tried the applewood smoked bacon flavor salt to see if it was better than their standard bacon salt.<br /><br />I love bacon. I like it well done and crispy. I often add the fake bacon bits to salads or pasta. The flavor is okay, bacon like but not as good as the real thing. I have started using the packaged crumpled bacon by Plumrose, or Oscar-myer. That gives a very nice real bacon flavor to anything you put it on.<br /><br />So when I received the package, I couldn't wait to open it and try it on some food. What a disappointment ! It tastes like salt and MSG with a slight smoky applewood yeast flavoring... not close to a nice bacon experience. I tried it on a sandwich, veggies, etc.... still a far cry from a nice bacon taste. Just salt, MSG and a little smoke flavor ...

review/summary: Great, tangy, somewhat filling
review/text: I grabbed these for a light lunch while our office fridge wasn't working. I was happy to see there are only 280 calories in the whole can for 6 of these. They are very tangy, which I like, and the leaves are soft and not stringy. The texture of the rice is a little mushy, but it's pretty good considering it sits in a can for so long. Two cons, one is that the lid is not easy to pop off. I didn't have a can opener and almost broke the pop top thing. So if you don't have access to a can opener, these might be a problem. The other con is that one of the oils in here solidified making these look very unappealing. But they taste good, so that's really all that matters. There is no fruit or anything in these, it's just the grape leaves stuffed with tangy rice. Very yummy, I wish I'd brought some bread now to dip in the oils that are left over!

review/text: As a vet tech with tens years experience it is my opinion that this is the worst dog food on the market. Yes, of course dogs love it, just like people love greasy, terrible-for-us fast food. In general, people should choose foods that contain only a few ingredients, and as little soy as possible, especially if your pet has any GI problems or any sort of allergies (which mostly manifest as red, itchy, gunky ears), and if so, corn, wheat, and even chicken may be a problem as well. Getting your pet on a better diet will make them happier and healthier and will reduce vet bills.

review/summary: great product
review/text: excellent product. this is the second one i bought in the past 6 years. we use it almost every night. it is very quite,  the auto humidity setting are very basic but works well. we have not found that we need the antibacterial accessory and it holds up to the occasional dishwasher cleaning. i would recommend this product

review/summary: Worst Rum Cake Ever
review/text: I've tried several brands of rum cakes over the years.  There are differences between them, but their usually minor.  This was a totally different experience.  First the presentation is bad.  I thought the can was a novel way of protecting the cake... No, it was cooked in the can and its hard to present it as anything else.  Next the taste and smell were not appealing.  It was a VERY dense cake with fruit overtones.

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: This powder has a rich smoke aroma and flavor. I love that it does not have that bitter aftertaste that I have found some liquid smoke products to have.  I agree with a previous reviewer that it does tend to clump when rubbed on the wet surfaces of meat but I was able to easily remedy this by combining the smoke powder with my other spices such as garlic and onion powder, seasoned salt etc., before applying it to the meat.  Also, drying the surface of the meat helps as well.  I highly recommend this product. Its great.

review/summary: Smoke
review/text: I make a lot of jerky and grill a lot of meat and liquid smoke can get expensive, so if you mix a little of this with water it goes a long way. Very good aroma and flavor.

review/summary: Smoke yes but mush no!
review/text: I enjoy grilling and making the related side dishes like baked beans etc. I am guilty of using at least 2 or 3 bottles of liquid smoke each month. After finding this product on Amazon I thought I would give it try. I have used several products from Colorado Spice and they have been good. This product was clumpy and does not sprinkle like a pinch of salt or anything else. If you try to rub onto or into meat it turns to a sticky paste which sticks well to your hands but not the meat. The smell is strong hickory and so is the taste (to strong or maybe the paste is too thick) I am back to liquid smoke. After 40 years of cooking it is still the only item that consistantly works.

review/summary: The best of Cameron's
review/text: We sent Woods and Water as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ESMHOI">Cameron's Gold Cup Whole Bean Coffee, 32-Ounce Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ESS8D2">Cameron's Intense French Whole Bean Coffee, 32-Ounce Bag</a> to my husband's parents as a gift.  They typically only drink Starbucks coffee but we went out on a limb based on all the good reviews for Cameron's coffee.  They like all three coffees, but they said in particular they like Woods and Water the most.  Once we move back to the US, we're going to try Cameron's out too!

review/summary: great coffee with a great price!
review/text: I have enjoyed this coffee flavor for a couple of years now and recently gave it for a gift to my son in Indiana who is a coffee-lover also. He really misses the northwoods in Mn so this was a perfect gift and he loved it also. It has a refreshing woodsy flavor like when you are making traditional campfire coffee! Price was very competitive also.
