review/summary: Awesome Sea Salt
review/text: We are learning that sea salt is better for us because of the reduced sodium content. This brand of sea salt has 400mg per 1/4 teaspoon which is even less than some other sea salts.  I find that the saltiness in Roland seems more intense than regular table salt, so am able to use even less of it and still have all of the flavor enhancement.

review/summary: I've had better sea salt
review/text: The product description did not include the fact that this salt also contains magnesium carbonate.  Despite that, it seems "moist".  The crystals don't make hard lumps but they also don't flow freely like some other brands of sea salt that I've had in the past.  It is difficult to use this salt in a salt shaker.<br /><br />This is the only Roland product I've purchased that has been less than satisfactory. I do not believe I would order it again.

review/summary: Wonderful fun making homemade candies for Christmas!
review/text: This chocolate is so easy to work with for making homemade molded chocolates.  We have used it for years for our traditional chocolate making at Christmas.  It melts easily in the microwave, and it molds beautifully.  The molded chocolates have a nice shine and a crisp bite.  I was very disappointed when I could not find it locally, so hurray for Amazon.  And this price is great. Direct from Ghirardelli's, it's $10 a box!!<br /><br />For a great chocolate treat, mix some rice krispies in some of the chocolate and fill a nice-sized mold halfway.  Lay a small piece of caramel apple wrap in the mold and then fill the remainder with plain chocolate.  Voila!  a home-made $100,000 bar.  These are our favorites.

It is also, to me, fairly stimulating so there is definitely a fair amount of caffein or caffeine like substance in it. But still not sencha as we know Japanese Sensha.

Well, needless to say, I immediately went to our friends Amazon and did a search and found these delights once more.

The bits of nuts made a great difference between this candy in the 60's and this castrated recipe today. But it is a light, sweet and chewy caramel even if it has been altered, but it would be more descript to name them Eunuch Caramel Chews and let the customer know.<br /><br />And...who names a band Squirrel Nut Zippers? ? You're screwing up Google searches for my fav treat.

review/summary: This is not a miracle health cure!
review/text: This is not a miracle health cure!<br /><br />I think some people have unrealistic expectations when it comes to products like this. They expect a sachet of powder  to be the basis of their nutrition regimen.<br /><br />I first experienced EBOOST when flying on Virgin America a while back. This product is available from the in-flight menu. I tried it a couple of times and found it to be a sweet pick-me-up. Did it have a health benefit? Maybe. It can't hurt to get the extra vitamins listed on the packet can it?<br />I take a range of supplements and while EBOOST is not as comprehensive as some others it does contain a decent amount of vitamins.<br /><br />I like the convenient sachets - I keep one or two in my carry bag and then shake it up in a bottle of water when I want a sweet taste. The taste reminds me a bit of Tang I used to have as a kid.<br /><br />I like this product - but please don't think it is the key to good health...

review/summary: Performance and Flavor--both are equally important
review/text: Now matter how effective a sports drink is, if you're riding a bicycle for five or more hours over a hundred mile course, whatever is in your water bottles has to taste good too.  I generally use Gatorade, not because it's the most effective but because it's more effective than just plain water AND it tastes good.  For comparison, the most effective sports drink I've ever used is Accelerade, but I wont put it in my water bottles because I can't stand drinking it hour after hour as I'm cycling up and down mountains over a 100 mile course.  Accelerade isn't bad, I just don't want to drink a gallon of it, all day long, in 90F+ heat.<br /><br />EBOOST has all the qualities I look for in a sports drink--for doing actual sports--which is simply that it's palatable (so I'll actually want to drink it) and effective at maintaining my endurance.<br /><br />Besides that, EBOOST comes in single serving packets which I can put in a jersey pocket and use throughout the ride when I visit water stations at rest stops rather than starting the ride with something I like and then having to drink whatever is available that I can tolerate.<br /><br />Flavor alone makes the difference between consuming enough fluids during an all day effort and energy-zapping dehydration.

review/summary: Gives The Right Kind of Boost
review/text: EBOOST gave me the right kind of boost. It made me feel energized, alert, focused, and ready to get through my day. What it didn't do was make me feel anxious or jittery like many other energy drinks.<br /><br />Full of B vitamins, Vitamin C,and other essential nutrients, EBOOST gives your body what it needs to enhance your immune system and keep you going in a good way.<br /><br />The taste is ok. It tastes a lot like an orange drink with a dash of salt. The salty taste most likely comes from the bicarbonates. But, it's really not that bad at all. Getting the desired effect far outweighs the slight salty taste.<br /><br />A cool glass of EBOOST will clear your mind and make you feel more refreshed than you've felt in a long, long time. Definitely a healthier choice than one of the popular canned energy drinks.

review/summary: I hope you're happy.
review/text: I recently gave up drinking soda and have been searching for a calorie-free alternative.  I'm a big fan of Tea2Go, but like most sweet-tasting mixes it has Splenda in it.  So even though I've replaced my Diet Pepsi addiction with watered down tea, I still feel a little guilty about it.<br /><br />So when EBOOST came along I thought it was a perfect opportunity to inject some vitamins into my diet.  And, let me tell you, EBOOST sure did.  I just didn't expect it to blast those vitamins through my tongue and out the back of my skull.<br /><br />You see, the folks who produce EBOOST believe that more is better.  And therefore, something that's good for you in large quantities is even better.  And while we're at it, why not just multiply the good stuff by a THOUSAND, because hey, how can it hurt, right?<br /><br />I take a daily multivitamin already and even the efficacy of a multivitamin is questioned by the FDA.  The reason being that different minerals are absorbed by the body differently, and often require fat in your diet (usually at the time of consumption) to be absorbed along with the vitamin. In other words, just sucking down a vitamin with water isn't going to do you much good.  And, in case it's not clear that this review is going down the toilet, dumping thousands of milligrams of certain vitamins into your system is going to pass right through you.<br /><br />Don't tell EBOOST that.  EBOOST has 1,000 mg of Vitamin C, which is 1,667% the daily recommended value.  Let me repeat: one thousand six hundred and sixty seven percent of the daily recommended value.  And here I thought I was okay drinking a glass of orange juice in the morning! I drank a full eight ounces of water with EBOOST and I'm surprised my head hasn't exploded already.<br /><br />In fact, the only vitamin that EBOOST doesn't include insanely high amounts of is potassium at just 14% of the daily recommended value, because that would reduce the efficacy of the 2,500 mcg of Vitamin B12.  Do you know how much of the recommended B12 daily value that is?  41,667%.  I read the label twice: FORTY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT of the daily recommended value.<br /><br />A quick search of several health sites explains how ridiculous this amount is. "Vitamin B12 supplements do not appear to improve energy or athletic performance, except in people with a vitamin B12 deficiency."<br /><br />Please folks - if you want to take care of these fragile bodies of ours, drink plenty of water, eat healthy, and exercise. There is no magic formula that will make you healthier except a healthy lifestyle.  There are plenty of other ways to get your vitamins, but EBOOST isn't it.<br /><br />Also, it tastes like metal shavings off a dirty muffler mixed in with an orange rind. But I have only myself to blame -- EBOOST fizzes when you pour it into water.  That's Nature's way of telling you not to drink it.

review/text: I took a long time to try EBOOST after I received it, because I was worried it might be bad to take it with a multi-vitamin (I hadn't considered this when I ordered it). But today I was feeling a bit tired, so I thought I'd go ahead and try it. There were no warnings on the package, so I figured it was probably ok.<br /><br />I sound like I'm building up to some kind of terrible reaction, but nothing happened. There was no effect at all, good or bad, because I just couldn't drink the stuff. I tried, but it was so nasty. It's very sweet on the surface, like artificial sweetner. This didn't bother me so much, though. What bothered me was the bitter, flat under-taste it had. It tasted like the lemon-lime laxative doctors force you to chug when they want to clean you out. Really awful. And it didn't go well with the artificial sweetner. It was bad enough to make me shudder.<br /><br />I'm sorry I can't write about how beneficial I found this drink mix. But it can't do me a lot of good if I can't drink it in the first place.

review/summary: good source of vitamins, but could taste better
review/text: Orange-flavored EBOOST is a fairly standard energy/vitamin drink.  It has 50% our the daily recommended value of zinc, 1667% of vitamin C, 100% of B6, 41667% of B12, 75% of niacin, as well as several other vitamins and nutrients, with only 5 calories per serving.  The B12 amount in particular is very high, and I'm not sure how if that is really necessary.<br /><br />It is supposed to be orange-flavored, but it also contains green tea extract, and I didn't think the orange taste was very authentic.  In fact, I found this drink to be overpowering and unpleasantly bitter.  The first time I tried it, I followed the directions and added 1 package to about 8 oz of water.  However, I found this unpalatable and had to dilute it until I had used 4 times as much water as instructed.  Because the vitamin levels are so high, I don't really have a problem diluting it to such a large extent, but other people might prefer something that is drinkable after following the directions.

review/text: I recently tried EBOOST for a four day trial period, with what I would consider "mixed results." The product provides a good orange/citrus flavor and I really like that it also provides the essential vitamins of Vitamin C, B6, B12, Zinc, Green Tea Extract to supplement a person's dietary requirements. However, as far as the "energy boost" that is suppose to accompany the use of the product . . . well I am more than a little skeptical. Overall I think it may be a helpful/easy way to supplement your diet, especially if you are not receiving the appropriate and necessary vitamins/minerals, but I am not convinced it will add to a person's vitality or daily energy level.

review/summary: Where's the Boost?
review/text: This product describes itself as a "Daily Health Booster." I'm not so sure about that, but it does have an array of vitamins and minerals, and an insane amount of B12. Since it is billed as a "dietary supplement" they don't have to substantiate any of the "health" claims. Like many "dietary supplements," it is overpriced.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the effervescence is all about. You pour the powder into a glass of water and it foams up, but doesn't seem to add anything to the resulting drink. The powder does dissolve completely, leaving no residue after mixing and drinking.<br /><br />The drink itself tastes like Tang (which is not necessarily a good thing) with a slight artificial sweetener aftertaste (which is definitely not a good thing). I got about the same "boost" from this as I did from drinking Tang, which is to say, "not much."<br /><br />If you need a "health boost" save your money and buy a bottle of multi vitamins. If you need effervescence, take the vitamins with a glass of orange soda.

review/summary: Tang + Green Tea + Fizz= EBoost
review/text: I handed out the packets to all ages in our house for their opinions.  My reaction was that it tastes like Tang with a fizz, my 12 year old said it was Tang + fresh, "Can't you taste the green tea at the end?" he asked.  I could and it does leave a pleasant lingering green tea taste.  My thirteen year old liked it equally well.<br /><br />We used smaller juice size glasses and filled with water and ice.  The EBoost fizzed and tasted great.<br /><br />My older son took a packet to college and during lunch drank EBoost instead of soda for a much healthier and still refreshing drink.<br /><br />With only 5 calories and no sugar, you get all the Vitamin C, B6, selenium, chromium you need for a day.  You get 50- 75% of niacin, folate (great for pregnant women), zinc, and 14% potassium.<br /><br />Here's what the packet tells you: EBoost's naural proprietary blend delivers energy that is unyielding, focus that is unclouded, immunity that is derived from vitamins and minerals, and a means of recovery that is not only sugar-free but delivers essential nutrients.  EBoost gives all those who rely on it a healthy comptetive advantage.  At work, at play, at life.<br /><br />Whew!  I don't know about all that but if it is true my son is sure to ace the physics test today!<br /><br />The taste is good enough to make a regular appearance at breakfast.

There's no harsh crash afterwards.<br />The drink comes in three delicious flavors ACAI POM, orange and pink lemonade. I chose the orange flavor and highly recommend it. Proceeds go to National Breast Cancer Research.

review/summary: Convenient change of pace
review/text: Dissolving Eboost Orange in a glass of water results in a mildly carbonated beverage with a Tang-like taste.  Although it is supposed to be an energy drink, it is not fortified with caffeine beyond what is in the tea extracts it contains, so I would not say that I felt an 'eboost,' but nor did I get the caffeine jitters.  It has amazingly high levels of vitamins C and B, most of which will likely go out in your urine.  However, since it is a powder Eboost is convenient to keep on hand and transport, unlike other sports and energy drinks with the water already added.

review/summary: Excellent Taste - No Jittery Energy Burst
review/text: First, the most important thing in my mind - taste. These orange flavored packets punch a wonderful citrus/orange flavor. Not too tangy, and not tart at all, they convey a perfect orange flavor. While not supplying a huge energy burst, they do make a noticeable difference. What they do NOT do, is give you that jittery feeling a lot of energy drinks do.<br /><br />Each packet contains a powdered flavor that completely dissolves in water. Each packet also contains the following - supplied by the company website :<br /><br />Anhydrous Caffeine<br />  * Increases Energy<br />  * Aids in Focus<br />  * Augments muscle strength<br />  * Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Chromium<br />  * Increases Energy<br />  * Regulates hunger<br />  * Reduces cravings<br />  * Helps protect DNA and RNA<br />  * Important to heart function<br />  * Helps control fat and cholesterol levels in the blood<br />  * Compliments of Suite101.<br /><br />Copper<br />  * Increases Energy<br />  * Aids in Focus<br />  * Augments muscle strength<br />  * Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Glucuronolactone<br />  * Increases Energy<br />  * Aids in Focus<br />  * Augments muscle strength<br />  * Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Potassium<br />  * Increases Energy<br />  * Aids in Focus<br />  * Augments muscle strength<br />  * Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Selenium<br />  * Increases Energy<br />  * Aids in Focus<br />  * Augments muscle strength<br />  * Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Sodium<br />  * Increases Energy<br />  * Aids in Focus<br />  * Augments muscle strength<br />  * Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Vitamin B12<br />  * Increases Energy<br />  * Aids in Focus<br />  * Augments muscle strength<br />  * Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Vitamin B6<br />  * Increases Energy<br />  * Aids in Focus<br />  * Augments muscle strength<br />  * Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Vitamin C<br />  * Increases Energy<br />  * Aids in Focus<br />  * Augments muscle strength<br />  * Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Zinc<br />  * Increases Energy<br />  * Aids in Focus<br />  * Augments muscle strength<br />  * Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />And all of the above come in a wonderfully flavored drink mix.

review/summary: A Boost of Energy
review/text: EBOOST:  Daily Health Booster provides the essential vitamins of Vitamin C, B6, B12, Zinc, Green Tea Extract to supplement one's dietary needs for the day.  As the label suggests:  energy, immunity, recovery, and focus are the necessary elements as well as the tangy, natural orange flavor that one packet possesses that is not quite as Crystal light or powdery as Tang but tasty enough to drink with as much as 5 calories.<br /><br />The packet is convenient and easy to mix into a water bottle or a full glass.  However, when dispensing the item into a water bottle, make sure to slowly pour the contents rather than quickly because what may result is an overflow of an orange colored mess that almost looks like a lab activity gone awry.<br /><br />Overall, EBOOST has a desirable taste that is satisfying and healthy.

review/summary: the best!
review/text: My cousin-in-law is Thai and she cooked an amazing curry for us.  I had to have the recipe and she said it was really very simple.  Just get the green Mae Ploy curry paste, some Asian basil, and some coconut milk.  A little salt, sugar, chicken, some bamboo shoots and rice were the only other things I would need to make it.  Well, I couldn't believe it was really THAT simple, but it was!  The paste imparts several subtle and delicious flavors to the curry.  Tastes like you slaved for hours.  I never have leftovers when I make this curry.  The paste is so low priced I plan to stock up so I'll always have some on hand.  Plus-- no preservatives, no wierd ingredients.  It's all food stuffs, albiet some of the ingredients I don't recognize... what is a galangal?  Whatever it all is, sure tastes good!

These make super yummy curry with or without coconut milk (we've recently started using chicken stock instead of coconut milk to cut down on the calories)<br /><br />A definite MUST HAVE for curry lovers<br /><br />Add some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016UX0K">Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce, 25-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)</a> to your pantry too!

review/summary: I don't have to beg my son to cook for me anymore....
review/text: Everyone who has had the opportunity to eat this loves this - I like this a lot with green and yellow zuccini, carrots and bamboo shoots with thin sliced turkey breast. Living too far from any real good oriental restaurants is no longer such a bummer...just came back to order more... price went up a bit but it's still well worth it.<br /><br />I see some complaints about too salty - I don't think it is salty and I do NOT use any salt when cooking nor do I eat any salty snacks so my taste buds would complain if this was too salty. Too hot? The way we make it, it's at most medium hot while the flavor is excellent (not diluted with coconut milk)...the hot sensation goes away very quickly...we love hot food - almost to a point of burning lips, eyes and nostrils hot but this is medium hot. Maybe it's less hot for us because we use a lot of veggies and eat it with white rice which always turns down the heat.

review/summary: just packaged curry paste quality; nothing to rave about
review/text: Many people are unnecessarily intimidated when it comes to making curry paste.  I am always disappointed by the people who are impressed with the taste of curry paste manufactured between 6 months and 18 months ago.  Its not hard to find the fresh ingredients and make it fresh.  It takes me less than 15 minutes to make something that is far superior in taste and nutrition to this product.  This product is widely used in Thai restaurants where the cooks don't want to cook, and don't want to invest the time in training workers who change restaurants every 6 months...they just want to hire untrained laborers who can open cans and scoop pre-made mixes out of containers.  It takes a bit of time and practice to make curry paste, but do it a few and you can master the art of working with the spices.  You will never go back to the cheap, low quality substitutes used in most Thai restaurants and sold in Asian grocery store. If you want the real thing, learn to make it or find a restaurant to support that makes their pastes from scratch.

The product mix in these packages should be closer to 10 vanilla, 10 lemon and 10 chocolate with the balance in the crackers.  I have half full cases of crackers sitting in the store room and the customers are screaming at me because I don't have any cookies on the shelf.  Kellogg's....are you listening?  Time to wake up!

review/text: I bought this because I am on a diet and I like to buy things in small packages to control portions. Once I got them and read the nutrition information I discovered that these are very high calorie for their size (around 220 calories). I am going to stick with Ritz Crackerfuls, double the flavor and half the calories (120 calories). The flavor of all of these Austins was bland and boring and there was never enough filling between the crackers or cookies. Most of the packets I opened had crushed pieces which spilled cracker dust all over the place. I tried one of each variety in this package and took the rest to work to give away to co-workers.

review/text: Not bad but not great either. My children of course love the cookies but when it comes to the crackers they just tell me they are extremely dry and pasty. You def. get a lot food for the money but when the children turn to them as the last resort snack when everything else is out... just doesnt make me want to repurchase.

review/summary: Great cracker and cookie snacks. Gets you through Chirstmas, Easter or Finals
review/text: I ordered my first set of Austin cookies and crackers right before Christmas time: Cards to write; presents to buy; presents to wrap; presents to deliver; gotta get decent clothes fixed up to go; shoes need to look nice; Pandora Christmas Bracelet Must be ready:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005PIGUS8">Authentic Biagi Decorative Cross Bead Sterling Silver European Charm</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044B1HGC">Swarovski GREEN and PINK Flowers Crystal Pave European Charm Bead AFTER CHRISTMAS BEAD SALE</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007IY276G">(Free Shipping!) " Jesus Raised Letters " Antique'd Silver Bead Charm Spacer Pandora Troll Chamilia Biagi Bead Compatible</a>. I snacked away as I did all the important things, slipped the beads and charms on my bracelet and went out to celebrate Christmas. The 26th (my birthday)...not a single cookie or cracker left to quench my hunger. All gone. Must have been good.<br /><br />I was celebate until Easter drinking only Muscle Milk <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DUD7JG">CytoSport Muscle Milk Light, Ready-to-Drink Shake, Chocolate, 14 Ounce, (Pack of 12)</a> until then, but the Holidays once again: Got to cook dinner for all 28 of the family members who will be in Phoenix for that big day; got to get a nice Easter outfit; get to church early to save 28 places; send out Easter Cards, and get the Easter Lilly. Better get some AUSTIN COOKIES AND CRACKERS FROM AMAZON BEFORE I start these tasks plus get the Pandora Easter Bracelet ready. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006YJUG8W">Antique Silver " Easter Egg " Charm Spacer Beads fits Pandora Troll Chamilia Biagi Bracelet</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DLEVNS">Sterling Silver Bunny Bead</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0077L0X0W">Jesus On Cross Against Flower Beads Fits Pandora Charm Bracelet</a>. Bracelet is ready, cards are sent, time for church, lets all have a snack of AUSTINS so we will hold out til dinner. Drat...not one left for me!<br /><br />Ok, It is time for Finals. There are not cards to send, meal to fix, or presents to buy. Will have to get a bracelet ready. It is tradition. But now so is AUSTIN COOKIES AND CRACKERS. But there are books to study; nights to be up reading all those books; now where are my class notes; where are my friends? Time to all pull together and get thru this Trig and this Chem. I will haul out the Austins, I know we will be up all night. Get the coffee pot on and the soda is ready also. Here we go guys: it is Engineers or bust: Pass me the cheese crackers.<br />Two days later we are all studied up. Engineers we will be, no worries there, but gotta order more Austins and do the bracelet thing:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PAFUO2">Bling Jewelry 925 Sterling Silver Wise Owl Scholar Books Bead Compatible with Pandora Bead Charms</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OSQSVQ">Zable(tm) Sterling Silver Graduation Cap Bead / Charm</a>.<br /><br />Well, a girl who is an engineer has to be graceful and wear her charm braclet to all important occasions. Also gotta provide the best Snack Foods whether it be time to get ready for Chistmas or cramming for finals. I found this huge box of snackers on Amazon and the are like "comfort food." I have eaten them since I was a kid. I do not imagine they are packed with good things for the body, but they make the body happy because they taste fine and bring back good memories. In fact, the crackers never contained much filling and today there is less than when I was a kid. The cookies certainly do not taste fresh baked, or anything like Mom's (Or today Mine) but they are sweet when sweetness is wanted. I would say that mostly these bring back good memories, taste pretty OK in the cracker line because of the salt not the fullness of filling which is actually spare. And the cookies are sweet. That is about it for the cookies. Filling and sweet. But good comfort food, and with those good memories, they get 4 stars.

review/text: I added this to my grocery wishlist as an Amazon recommendation which popped up after I had added something else. I really should've taken a minute to look at the product page, or to realize what would happen before it was too late and someone bought this for me:<br /><br />Nearly HALF THE STUFF IN THIS THING HAS PEANUT BUTTER.<br /><br />To which I am deathly allergic.<br /><br />Peanut allergies are fairly common, so why the hell is half of this thing peanut butter crackers? I can see putting 10 packs of peanut butter crackers in here, maybe 12, but TWENTY?! WHY?!<br /><br />Let this be a warning to people with peanut allergies -- AVOID this product. You'll be stuck with a massive pile of crap you can't eat.

review/text: This is excellent.  The cherry taste isn't very pronounced though.  My teenage son is happy about that as he dislikes cherries ever since the cherry flavored cough medicine he had when he was little.  My kids all love this.  We eat it plain, with kefir, and with milk.  The peanut butter granola is good too, but I prefer this one with kefir.  We've tried the pumpkin/flax granola and the peanut butter.  While the others are good too, this one has the best taste according to my family.

review/summary: Where are the cherries? (plus, it isn't real granola)
review/text: Bought this "granola" because it looked good on the box with the dried cherries in it.  It turns out it is "granola" in only the loosest sense because it has just a bit of real granola (ie; rolled oats) mixed in with a whole bunch of rice crisps.  Cheap.<br /><br />The worst part though was the complete lack of cherries.  The photo on the box shows dried cherries interspersed in the spoonful of cereal depicted.  But when I poured out my first bowl of cereal no cherries whatsoever were visible.  I wondered if maybe they had all settled to the bottom, so I took the bag out of the box to look... no cherries at the bottom either.  I poured the entire contents into a mixing bowl and eventually found a single chunk, about 1/8 the size of a pea, that might have been a tiny chip off of a cherry at one point.  That was it.  Putting "cherries" in the name of this cereal is thus a total lie.  It should read "there might be a remote chance that you'll find a tiny chunk off of just one cherry in this cereal".  What a ripoff.

review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Great for bean salad. Just add your favorite organic vinaigrette salad dressing and serve. Wonderful and easy for potlucks or dinner parties. Garbanzos (chickpeas) with pintos and kidney beans is a great combo. 375kcal and 26g protein per can. Made with only organic beans, sea salt, and water. Labeled "vegetarian," but is vegan also.

review/text: Ordered in November 2008 and have opened 6 cans.  So far, inspite of the product "content" and label, all six have contained almost all pinto beans, only a few kidney beans, and absolutely NO garbanzo beans.<br /><br />I can only assume this is so because pinto beans are the cheapest of the three and garbanzo the most expensive.<br /><br />Very disappointed in Westbrae, and won't purchase this product again.

review/summary: So delicious and versatile
review/text: There are so many ways this can of natural goodness can be served. I find more ways as time goes along, but I fall back on my favorite. I open the can, drain the liquid in a cup, drink it, yum, pour the beans in a bowl with the bottom lined with crushed organic saltine crackers to absorb moisture, fork on organic sweet pickle relish and chopped ginger (from a jar) and chow down. I don't heat it up, I like it room temp with the relish and ginger cold or just out of the cabinet. I buy as pack of 12, 15-ounce cans a month from Amazon. I used to buy 4 packs of 12 (48 cans - so I wouldn't every run out), but I have found other treats to fill in and I was liking them too much I think. :)

review/text: I absolutely love these gummy worms (and the gummy bears). The texture is super yummy, and they are not overly sweet (since they are made with natural sweeteners) which doesn't give me a stomach ache like conventional ones. These fulfill my craving for chewy candy without the guilt, and they are fair trade and organic- which both support good causes. I can't see where you can go wrong with these! Also, the slightly higher price is worth it since (like i previously mentioned) they are healthy, yummy, and for a good cause!!

The Yummy Earth Gummy Worms are made from real fruit juice and nothing artificial. The flavor also tastes unprocessed, almost as if you are eating real ingredients! The sour coating is just right -- not too sour. The worms are smaller in size than most conventional worms but that doesn't bother my kids one bit.

review/text: The finest ginger beer I've discovered anywhere. It is strong and leaves others behind in taste tests. I'd recommend it to all ginger beer lovers.

review/summary: Best Dark n Stormy ever
review/text: I ordered this brand because I like a real bite in my ginger beer. Supermarket brands like Reed's or Barritts are syrupy and sweet with no ginger bite and Fever Tree has the perfect balance.

review/summary: Can do better
review/text: I like that this juice is organic but it is weak on the actual cranberry content due to the "blend." Too diluted by apple juice. I can buy pure organic cran juice at my supermarket for less per bottle. Take that, splice with some water, add a splash of orange juice for a nice mix, and you have a better value per ounce.

review/summary: Great product but beware expiration date
review/text: My dogs LOVE these treats.  They're soft, chewy, smell wonderful, they're low cal and seem to be a very healthy choice compared to a lot of other dog treats on the market.  I break them in half and use them during dog training class.  I give the product itself 5 stars.  But overall I'm only giving a 3-star rating because I ordered 6 packs of these treats in mid-Oct, shipped via two day shipping, and three of the six packages expire at the end of Oct.  Very disappointed with the vendor who fulfilled this order.  Definitely will NOT order from this store ever again.

review/summary: Dogs go wild for them
review/text: The dogs just love them and actually start barking after dinner just to get them.  They love all the flavors.  Having very few teeth, the puppy mill rescue especially loves the softer ones.

review/summary: awesome
review/text: These (and all the fruitables) have got to be the yummiest smelling dog treats ever!  They have great ingredients and the dogs love them!  They are a little on the pricey side though.

review/summary: Nice small snack
review/text: Both of my dogs (chihuahua & corgi) love these snacks.  When they see me grab the bag, they start whining for one.  These snacks are small enough to give a few to your dog each day.  I think they are a little too large for training snacks.  They smell absolutely wonderful, just like blueberries.  I will reorder for my little guys.

review/summary: Good enough to eat!
review/text: I've been buying regular Fruitables Cookies for awhile and intend continuing.  And now, I'm in love with the minis.  At a little over 3 calories, and with a fragrance that draws our dogs into the room, I see these as perfect training treats, especially if you are working to teach a good habit, like "Stay" and need to give several rewards.<br /><br />My four dogs love them.
