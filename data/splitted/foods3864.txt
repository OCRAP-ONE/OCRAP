review/summary: Nice, savory, and natural
review/text: I tried this first, attempting to find a replacement for the Knorr Vegetable bouillon groceries in my area quit carrying.  I was a bit concerned at first with the texture.  it comes in foil wrapped cubes, but they seem sticky compared to other cubes I've seen, and didn't know if this was a quality issue.  The no-added salt part seems to mean no salt at all... you have to add some to bring out the flavor.  i think i will try the sea salt version next time.  overall, quite happy with this one!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I searched all over the place for an affordable, no salt added, vegetable bouillon that didn't contain all kinds of extra ingredients.  I was very happy to find this product and use it so often I have signed myself up for a recurring shipment of it, which saves me even more money!  It is tasty and adds the perfect touch to the many soups I feed my family.  It does contain naturally occurring sodium, of course, but nothing beyond that.

review/summary: Delicious, healthful bouillon!
review/text: The Rapunzel no salt added vegetable bouillon is very tasty, both as a stand alone broth and as a fabulous alternative to cooking with oil. Instead of sauteeing our vegetables in oil we now add a bouillon cube to water (with garlic and other spices to taste) to sautee mushrooms, spinach and all other manner of vegetables. Dishes are less greasy and oily, and this bouillon subtlely enhances the natural flavors of food with minimal added sodium. An excellent, versatile, low-caloric healthy product. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Great way to jack up flavor without additional salt
review/text: I like these because not only are they clearly vegan, but also no salt has been added (I think there's a minimal amount of natural sodium in there.) So it doesn't make foods more salty just more flavorful. Fortunately I can find these locally but the deal on Amazon is pretty good.

review/summary: Contains MSG (called yeast extract)!!!
review/text: When I first discovered this product, I was in heaven. Finally, a wonderful "clean" VEGAN bouillon. And then-----came the realization that the product has an additive they call "yeast extract," which is another name for MSG.  I contacted the company and asked the question. They sent me a document I was unable to open. I wrote again . . . and again . . . no answer.<br />Though they do claim "no MSG added," they are not being transparent or honest. There is MSG in this. And while MSG does occur naturally in certain foods, like tomatoes, etc., the fact is Rapunzel DOES add it through yeast extract, to "improve" the flavor. It's really disappointing. I want to love them. But I don't like being misled.

review/summary: I want salt!
review/text: I mistakenly bought this instead of the with salt product that I absolutely love.  I have been using it, though, and have been adding my own sea salt.  These no salt cubes do not dissolve as well as the version with salt; therefore, making a cup of broth is much more difficult.  I typically add a cube to the cooking water when I make rice or quinoa, and the cubes with salt dissolve before the water boils, while these cubes stay intact during cooking and need to be mixed in after the grains are cooked.

review/summary: Possibly my Favorite K-Cup
review/text: I recently purchased Tully's Full City Roast, as well as Tully's House Blend.  They are both excellent, but personally, I prefer the House Blend by a small margin.  I like several of the extra bold k-cups, especially Gloria Jean's Black Gold, Timothy's Rainforest Espresso and Midnight Magic, and Coffee People Donut Shop.  But I find the Tully's House Blend to have a great mix of being rich and flavorful, but still very drinkable anytime.  It may be my favorite k-cup right now, and I will definitely keep a stock of it around our house.

review/summary: I'm a Tully's Fan! The House Blend Is Becoming One Of My Favorites.
review/text: If we had a 'I'm A Fan' button to push, I would definitely be a fan of Tully's K-cups.<br /><br />Usually I drink lots of Tully's French and/or Kona, and Italian is a new favorite that I know I'll be drinking now that I've tried it.<br /><br />When I think of Tully's Coffee House Blend, I think of going into a restaurant and smelling that wonderful aroma of freshly-made coffee. It tastes delicious!<br /><br />At first I didn't think of it as one of my all-time favorites, because it's just an excellent cup of coffee. Good flavor and aroma, not too dark, not too strong, not too bitter, just delicious. I just came back to edit this review and say that it is becoming one of my all-time favorites, just another great option from Tully's.<br /><br />I used to say that I like to keep it around to drink after I've burned out my taste buds on stronger blends and want to calm my taste buds down a little. Now I've found that I enjoy it pretty much any time.<br /><br />One thing I would say about Coffee House Blend is that it will probably please more people in a household or guests visiting than my all-time favorites, which are way too strong for many people. This is a good choice to please more people. It should please just about everyone!<br /><br />EDITED once more. I came back later to say that with all of my other K-Cup options available to me, I keep reaching for the Tully's House Blend. I don't know if it's just a mood I'm in right now or what, but the others just seem like they are trying too hard. Whatever the reason, I'm enjoying House Blend.<br /><br />EDITED still once more to say now my favorites are House and Italian, both Tully's. It's the best!

review/summary: Bold But Not Extra Bold.  Smooth, Flavorful & Not Bitter..
review/text: Tully's House Blend falls squarely into the Bold category, but it is definitely not an Extra Bold coffee.  It is smooth, flavorful and does not have a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />**** For those medium blend coffee drinkers, this blend may be too strong.  For those that like a jolt in the morning, this coffee may not be bold enough. ****<br /><br />This blend, taste-wise, is not quite as full-bodied as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M62D5S">Tully's Italian Roast, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> yet it is bolder than the Kona blends, which are no longer available.  I also find that it has a just a little more kick than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GVA4">Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>, which is one of my favorite blends to-date.

review/summary: Great coffee, excellent price
review/text: I've been drinking the Tully's House Blend K-Cup coffee for a few years now. I occasionally buy a different variety just to try it out, but always find myself wanting the Tully's more. I have to admit, I do like the new Starbucks K-cups, but they are almost as expensive as going to a Starbucks and buying coffee there, so I'll stick with my Tully's. I find the blend to be just the right mixture of smooth and bold. I can use a single K-cup twice to fill my 16 oz to-go mug and find that it's still strong enough.

I recently tried Tully's Kona Blend and it's good but expensive and not available via the "Subscribe and Save" program.  So I took a chance on their House Blend and like it even better than the Kona Blend!  It's a "Bold"<br />K-cup so contains enough coffee to make the larger size cup without it's being weak and the flavor is nice and rich without being bitter or chalky-tasting.  It's my new favorite K-cup!!!

It's absolutely *perfectly* balanced, without a hint of bitterness. Just smooth as silk, it's the kind of coffee that makes you take a sip, curl up in your chair and sigh in satisfaction at the taste. This coffee is actually prompting me to buy a Keurig of my own now, and this will be the very first blend that will go in it.

review/summary: Simply the best K cup out there
review/text: I have been thru them all and Tully's simply makes the best K cups out there. The house blend is great, breakfast blend as well and the hard to find Kona is in a class by itself. Better than Green Mountain, Timothy's, Gloria Jean and Newman's Own. They simply use better coffee beans and the cups are all very consistent. All of their coffees are "Bold" (even the breakfast blend) but the are never bitter like some other Bold varieties. The superb reviews on this brand are accurate.

review/summary: Solid Gourmet Cup of Coffee
review/text: Its just dark enough for my tastes to be brewed on the 7.25oz setting. It has a dark chocolate and brandy aroma. The house blend has a boldness falling in between a medium brew (gloria jeans hazlenut) and a lighter bold brew (newmans organic). The taste is pleasant and has notes of cocoa and malt, and an aftertaste of walnuts. I would recommend this as a keep around the house brew, but not for something to impress guests.

review/summary: Less expensive alternative to the Kona Blend
review/text: I have long been a fan of the Tully Kona Blend coffee. I was disappointed when my local retailer quit selling Kona products!<br /><br />I actually ordered this house blend by accident, thinking that I was ordering the Kona Blend. I had more than 4 cups of coffee before I noticed on the packaging that it said House Blend instead of Kona Blend. I would not have known that it was not the Kona Blend had I not seen the packaging. One caveat: I make "lattes" by adding an equal amount of steamed milk to my coffee, so the coffee flavor is probably diluted for me.  Someone drinking it straight up may notice a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />My bottom line is that it is much less expensive than the Kona Blend, due to vendor and shipping costs, and it is more than good enough for me.  I've since ordered another box.

As a new Keurig owner, I taste-tested a variety of brands (since it was so easy to do) but my local favorite, Tully's, came out on top.  If smooth, rich, full-bodied coffee can be called comfort food, Tully's has it nailed.  Happily, Amazon shipments arrive promptly.  Yes, K-cup packs are pricey, but life is short.

review/summary: One great cup of coffee
review/text: I've purchased many different K-Cups over the last year or so that I've owned my Keuirg.  I was always looking for that smooth great cup of coffee.  Not too weak, not bitter, not smokey.  Tullys House Blend is smooth and rich.  It's my "go to" coffee in the morning.  Ahhhhhh<br /><br />Amazon makes it a great deal purchasing through them.  I make sure I never run out.<br /><br />Love it!

review/text: I'm having a cup of this coffee as I am writing this review. It was the deal most of all that made me buy this Tully's blend. I think Tully does make some of the best kcups I have had though. Love the Kona blend but now is quite expensive. This has a nice flavor to me but could be a bit stronger. That being said, if I get another deal on this blend, I will definately by it again.

review/summary: Tully's Coffee House Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)
review/text: I've always appreciated my Keurig brewer but didn't realize how much until I was away from home, no brewer and NO K-cups! I hadn't anticipated the level of 'separation anxiety' I suddenly experienced. Undaunted, I purchased a package of Tully's freshly ground coffee and returned to a conventional coffee maker.  The result was ok - :} but not really the usual great.  Then came reality.  THE GROUNDs.  What a mess! Not only totally inconvenient to measure, but annoyingly difficult to confine to the basket since they always seem to prefer the counter, the sink, the floor, anywhere but where they're supposed to be.  Then, the challenge of disposal-what a mess. Next,the mixing. TOO weak(like "stump-water" I over-heard,) TOO strong...ugh!!!! It was back to that awful trial and error period  which had been so quickly forgotten.  Oh, and don't even ask about the bottled water.  Fortunately the trip was abbreviated and I was soon re-united with my Keurig brewer and my treasured Tully's K-cups.  Lesson learned.

This house blend has been a good replacement.

I really recommend you try it if you are looking for a strong but smooth coffee!

review/text: As many others have stated, the taste of this coffee is fantastic.  Flavor wise, it is by far my favorite.<br /><br />My concern is that these K-cups keep jamming up my coffee maker.  Every time I make this brand of coffee, I have to use a paper clip the next morning to un-jam the Keurig.  I've noticed that these K-cups have a unique behavior about them.  After making a cup of coffee, I go to eject the empty cup.  The empty cup has a large amount of coffee grains on the top of it.  I have never seen this before in my 4 years of using a Keurig.  I am guessing this behavior is directly affecting the coffee maker by jamming it up.

review/text: Like some of you said, I only got 48 also.  Why do they advertise 50 and then send 48?  It seems minimal to us but 2 times the number of orders adds up for them really fast.  I don't like feeling cheated probably won't order again.  The coffee was strong.  I would compare it to Starbucks.  The order information says they have three different strengths and I didn't see where you can choose the strength so they shipped me Extra Bold.  I usually drink coffee black but with this, I make a 10 oz and 4 oz with one k-cup and then add some cream so I guess that knocks down the per cup price.  Still with feeling cheated, I will look for something better.

review/text: Sometimes I'm a bad mom and I accidentally run out of our regular dog food, and since the big and little pet stores in my area have stopped carrying it I am relegated to the supermarket to feed my boys.  Most of the big brands at these stores feature a horror show of ingredients (read the ingredients on a bag of Ol' Roy if you want to make yourself nauseous), but not the Purina One Beyond.  The first two ingredients are meat, and there are no by-products or corn products anywhere on the list.  My one guy with a sensitive stomach does just fine if we have to switch to this for a few days.  While the Purina One Beyond doesn't have the extra UMPH to make me switch from our regular food, I feel totally comfortable using it when I need a back up, and that's saying a lot.

It's also quite a bit cheaper and more readily available in typical grocery stores than the best brands.<br /><br />My dog in particular didn't seem to like the healthiest brands (I collected some samples to offer to her to try to figure out what she might enjoy and tried buying a couple I couldn't get as samples as well). This food is the best compromise I've found between price, the dog's preferences, and my desire to make sure she's eating something that's decently healthy.<br /><br />I still tend to supplement it with bits of things from my meals like (dog-friendly) steamed vegetables to help keep it interesting and vary her diet a little with healthy things, but it's been working out well.

The fact is, the bottler probably buys casks of whatever Islay distiller has over-produced.  The result is that the flavors change from bottle to bottle.  Not bad, just different. A cheaper way to sample the flavors of Islay.

And I LOVE the Tassimo Gevalia Latte pods (T-Discs).<br /><br />What I like best:<br /><br />-- There's two discs used for each cup of coffee (latte), one is the REAL MILK creamer, the other espresso.<br /><br />-- This gives you the option of having an espresso ONLY, should you choose. Simply don't use the included creamer disc.<br /><br />-- The strength of the espresso or milk is separately adjustable. Simply hold the big, shiny button when the green light is flashing (flashes after the initial brew) and the unit adds more steamed water to the espresso and/or the milk.<br /><br />-- The milk in this latte pack is real milk, not powdered crud like other machines use! IMO it imparts a better, more genuine coffee house flavor to the latte.(Bonus Tip: The milk has been pasteurized at extremely high temperature. That gives it a longer shelf life, but still only about six to 10 months - do NOT refrigerate or freeze. So if you buy these off of eBay or here, ask the seller the date code on the side of ANY package containing dairy (hot chocolate, creamer discs, etc.) since you do not want to get a package close to the shelf life expiration or worse, with expired dates.<br /><br />-- If you want a latte quick, you can be sipping a just-right (not too hot, not lukewarm) in about two minutes from adding the first disc. To avoid fisticuffs on who goes first in the morning or in the break room, there is a dual coffee maker that brews two cups, side by side.<br /><br />-- Unlike other machines, the Bosch Tassimo machine(formerly made by Braun) has a bar code reader that reads the bar code on the label on each disc. The machine reads the bar code and knows what it is supposed to do in terms of how much water to add, how long to heat, etc. How cool is that! Very! For example, if you insert a 12 oz. coffee T-disc, the machine automatically knows to add 12 ounces of hot water to the brewed coffee. If you insert an espresso disc (which comes in this latte package) the machine adds just the right amount of water to make an espresso like you would find in an Italian cafe (about three tablespoons of water). If you need to wake up in the morning have an espresso, you will be gritting your teeth, driving 80 mph in the car to work).<br /><br />-- COFFEE FLAVOR IS EXTREMELY SUBJECTIVE. One man's elixir of the Gods is to another Satan's poison. So these coffees are like romantic relationships. Only you know what you see in someone and you are not going to base a relationship on what friends, family or co-workers think of your significant other. Same goes for coffee. Why on earth would you buy coffee, or not, based on what a total stranger (that's me) thinks tastes good. You need to make up your own mind on what tastes good to you.<br /><br />So what I recommend is that you buy a sampler and find out what you like. After that, then buy packs containing 8 to 14 cups of brew. (Because I like a lot of Half/Half in my way-too-strong coffee shop coffee, I ended up loving these Gevalia Latte T-Discs (but I also happen to like Gevalia coffee). You may like the Maxwell House coffee or the Gevalia Morning Roast blend (I find the Gevalia Morning Roast way too strong for my tastes. I found that with the 12 oz T-Disc I was cutting the 12 oz brewed coffee in half and adding 4 ounces of Half & Half like I had been doing at Starbucks, for example. So that coffee is NOT for me.)<br /><br />-- These individual coffee machines are the rage for making coffee. It is great in the office break room, or for couples who want fresh cups of coffee each morning but not a full or partial pot (making a partial pot is a hassle). I predict that all other coffee makers, except for making big pots for four to ten people, will fall by the wayside. Even with large groups I predict most people are going to want a coffee made to order.<br /><br />-- It is also a fantastic way to save money. Each cup of coffee costs less than a dollar, on average. That's far less than paying $3 to $5 at Starbucks.<br /><br />Bonus Info:<br /><br />-- The package indicates the product is made by Kraft Foods. IMO that's a name you can trust and it will back up the product.<br /><br />-- Do NOT refrigerate, do NOT freeze (the creamer disc will explode rendering them unusable).<br /><br />-- The date code (expiration date) for the creamers (that are a real dairy product, not powered MRE cr#p) is clearly displayed on the side of the package. On mine just bought on 12/02/11 the date code is Aug 05, 2012.<br /><br />-- You can also lose weight with these machines? How is that? Well I don't know about you, but when I used to get my morning and afternoon cup of coffee at Starbucks I would also cave and get a sweet roll of some type. So by not going to the cafe I cut out the temptation (and eventual desire) to get a lemon bar or carrot cake. Cutting out two sweets a day, that has to result in significant weight loss.<br /><br />-- These are cheaper online than, for example, at my local supermarket. For an Eight Latte pack (8 espresso, 8 creamers) I paid $12.99 at my local Safeway. Of course at Safeway I had the latte pack in hand immediately, no waiting for shipping. So for me in an emergency Safeway will do albeit that significantly increases the PPCOC.<br /><br />Sidenote: These machines are a win win. The coffee machine manufacturers and producers make a lot more money because these discs give us far less coffee (per pound if you want to use that measure). But we win because of convenience, weight loss, and also saving money by not spending $10 daily at the cafe (coffee and a sweet). Even a coffee by itself cost about $3 to $5 here in San Francisco, so cutting that expense is significant.<br /><br />Office managers, this is a reason to get one of these types of machines. And arguably productivity will go up since employees won't be leaving the office to get a coffee. And making a coffee with one of these machines is fun. So it might even boost morale (the first few months will be trying because you will have to determine which T-Discs people want. There might be fights if two employees argue over who gets the last latte in the pack.

review/summary: Tassimo Disc Malfunction
review/text: I have been using tassimo gevalia espresso for at least three years and LOVE it.  The pods now have a new foil covering.  For some reason, when I lift the handle to take out the pod it explodes with hot grounds, making a gigantic mess and ruining the cup of coffee.  I would say at least half of each box does this.  Irritating!

review/summary: For Those Who Like a Sweet, Mild Coffee
review/text: I must be missing a chromosome somewhere, because I never learned to drink grown-up coffee, and if it were going to happen, it would have done so by now.  If you like your coffee really strong, don't buy this.  It is expensive, and it will disappoint you.  This is for coffee wimps like me who like a mild-tasting coffee with some other sweet, dessert-like taste.<br /><br />I am a teacher.  For years, I have had students walk into my classroom and say, "What smells so good?"<br /><br />Lowering my coffee cup as they pass by me to enter the room, I ask, "Does it smell like this?"<br /><br />"YES!  What IS that???"<br /><br />It's mine!  And it is growing harder to find all the time.  Dear, dear Maxwell House, please expand your supply in major West Coast markets. It's my one vice in life, and after 35 years, I have to have a delicious International Coffee.  You discontinued the yummy white chocolate flavor, as well as the Kahlua one that was to die for.  But I'll be just fine, as long as I can get more of this.<br /><br />I have just ordered a great deal of this coffee from Amazon because they say the supply is low; this frightens me.<br /><br />One note: although I prefer full calorie, full caffeine style, I find that the low calorie variety is actually not bad, especially when cut half and half with the full strength type. It's an instant coffee, and that's how you prepare it...but it tastes so much better.  This stuff will improve your morning like nothing else.

review/summary: Amazing Tea
review/text: Orange Pekoe tea is the best tea to use for sweet tea, in fact its what the commercial teas use. I'm also including the recipe I use to make my tea. With this recipe I have to make a new batch every 1-2 days because everyone loves it.<br /><br />Recipe (Makes 1 Gallon | Est. Total Time: 2 hours 30 Minutes)<br />1 Gallon Filtered Water<br />2 Cups Sugar<br />6 Orange Pekoe Tea Bags<br /><br />1. In a large pot bring water to a rolling boil then remove from heat.<br />2. Place six tea bags in the water, and let steep for 1 full hour. Be sure to cover with a lid!<br />3. After 1 hour, remove tea bags and add the sugar. Stir to dissolve, recover and let sit for another hour.<br />4. Dump tea into a one gallon pitcher, then refrigerate.<br /><br />Note: If you don't like your tea too sweet try doing 1 and a half cups first and then do a taste test. If you feel you need more then add the other half. I also recommend you serve this tea cold.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br /><br />This tea also makes me heart race, that being said I limit how much I drink of this tea. I mainly make it for other people to enjoy. If you have problems with caffeine or sugar making your heart race as I do then I suggest you stay clear of this unless you're going to drink a small cup. The first time I drank this I had a big glass of it and my heart rate went over 100. You may also want to look into caffeine free tea.

review/text: I love this "Real" Tetley tea in convenient round bags. No annoying unwrapping and de-stringing. Seems to me that the same brand of tea made for the US market is decidedly insipid in comparison to the Canadian Tetley tea. Although I could drive up to Canada to buy this tea, the trip and hotel stay would bring the cost up considerably. Now if you could start importing "Bick's Sweet Mixed Pickles", I would be in heaven.

review/text: I love tea, but never been a fan of Chai tea. Then my sister sent me this brand, and it is delicious! A wonderful rich flavor similar to hot chocolate, but not so sweet. No transfats, no gluten, no hydrogenated oils. 99% caffeine free, so you can enjoy it in the afternoon. I haven't tried the vanilla or chocolate yet, but am sure going to. Try it by buying the smaller packets, and if you like it, it's available at Sam's Club in a big can for a very cost-saving price.

review/summary: Taste the RAINBOW, a lot of RAINBOW
review/text: UPDATE: Amazon has lowered the price to under $6 x2 a bag which is around $1 less per bag than what we've seen at Wal-Mart.<br /><br />What can I say, it's two giant bags of SKITTLES.<br /><br />You get two 41 ounce resealable bags of SKITTLES, you may have seen these in the Wholesale Clubs or in the candy aisle at your local WAL-MART. Amazon is thankfully selling these themselve's instead of what was previously only available from 3rd party Marketplace sellers who inflate the prices by 2x, 3x, 4x or even more than what you'd pay in a physical store NOT including shipping/tax. Buying direct from Amazon offers you FREE shipping, $25+ of more purchase, or FREE 2 shipping day if you have PRIME, which is great.<br /><br />Our Skittles were double sealed in plastic packaging within a cardboard box with plenty of air pillow bags. The two bags Skittles and thee Skittles themselves were in great condition and weren't expired.<br /><br />Given that WAL-MART charges about $6.50 per bag so this price for two from Amazon is great since you don't have to go down to Walm-Mart or the Wholesale Club and feel like an idiot buying a MEGA bag of Skittles when you bring this up to the cashier.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: These bags of Skittles are of the Gluten Free, Gelatin Free variety.

review/text: We all know what the product tastes like, so no need to review that.  I was initially concerned these wouldn't be shipped in time, since a lot of the other reviews described cancelled orders, etc.  But I noticed that many of them seemed to be referring to buying them as part of a manager's special or something and figured I'd give this a try.  I received the Skittles in 2 days (Amazon Prime, 2-day shipping) with no problems.  They were packaged well and they are otherwise just as described.  So while I can't speak for the problems that others had, for me this was a flawless order.  5 stars.<br /><br />Edit: I ordered this a second time recently.  Just like the first time, which was several months prior, they arrived promptly and in excellent condition.
