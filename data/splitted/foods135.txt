review/summary: My new favorite coffee creamer!!
review/text: I wanted to try something new, as I was getting tired of the same old coffee creamers (French vanilla, hazelnut, etc..) this vanilla caramel is great! Since it is powdered you don't have to worry about spillage or breakage during shipment, which is a problem with the liquid coffee creamers. I will definitely be buying this again!

review/text: I love yoo-hoo.  it's one of my favorite 'gas station' buys...meaning, i don't buy it from the store, but if i'm going on a trip or something, i'll pick up a yoo-hoo.<br /><br />I was super surprised to find this drink mix.  It was cheap and I thought the kids and i would like making our own yoo-hoo at home.  i was totally disappointed.  it does not taste like yoo-hoo. it tastes nasty.  almost too sweet?  and it doesn't dissolve well in milk.  you can stir and stir, and you still have nasty clumps floating on the top of your milk.<br /><br />i did give it two stars because...well, it's drinkable.  and my kids kind of like it.

review/summary: SIMPLY DELICIOUS
review/text: I first tasted the donut house coffee's while waiting for an MRI. I am not a coffee drinker, at least I wasn't at that time. I made a cup of the donut house cinnamon roll flavor coffee. I didn't plan on drinking the coffee... I just wanted to try out the coffee maker. To my surprise the coffee was delicious. I came home and kept thinking about that cup of coffee. 3 months later I bought a Keurig coffee maker. I'm a little sensitive to caffeine so I decided to try the donut house decaf coffee. The donut house cinnamon roll used to be my favorite flavor coffee, well now the donut house decaf runs a close 2nd. I live in Michigan and on many cold nights I'll make a cup of the donut house decaf coffee before I go to bed.

They are just "okay", where they used to be FAR superior, heads and shoulders above the competition! I'm extremely disappointed. They taste so BLAH now. I won't be buying them anymore.

review/text: I have tasted many packages of brownie mix, most of them contain hydrogenated oils, propylene glycol, and lots of other nasty ingredients. These brownies are by far the best tasting, with all pure ingredients. I love to bake a batch, cut them into small squares, and put them in the freezer for a great treat. Anyone sensitive to wheat will absolutely LOVE these brownies. You won't be disappointed! Great with walnuts too.

review/text: The Gluten-Free Pantry Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix is so easy to make and tastes heavenly.  I combined two packages and baked the brownies in a large cake pan, then cut them into serving size and froze them.  They taste as good after being frozen as they did the day I baked them.  In my book, these brownies taste better than anything sold in the supermarkets as regular wheat-containing brownies.  I recommend the mix to anyone hungry for the real thing!

review/summary: Absolutely delicious brownies
review/text: My son is allergic to milk and wheat on on the ASD spectrum so he's been on the Gluten-free Casein-free diet all his life. He loves these brownies. I make them with egg white and water instead of the oil to cut out the added fat, but they are still great and easy to make. The only drawback is that they are full of sugar, which makes my son hyper-stim so we have to dole them out one at a time.<br /><br />We buy them buy the case from Amazon every few months. Thanks Gluten Free Pantry.

review/summary: They will never know they're gluten free...
review/text: I have made these brownies for family and for a den of cub scouts and no one would have known they were gluten free and everyone asked for seconds!  These brownies have a fudgy texture and have bits of chocolate chips in them which are delicious.  I would say the mix is very thick and a little difficult to work with.  The cooked brownies are slightly difficult to cut into very neat edges as the edges tend to crumble a little and I would also say that they make a slightly thinner layer of brownies than most of the store brand gluten containing but they taste just as good, if not better.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />(For those wondering, this mix requires 2 eggs OR 4 egg whites and 7 tbs melted butter to prepare.  They do have suggestions for lactose free and low fat preparations)

review/text: These are great brownies that just happen to be gluten free!  Everyone loves them, including wheat eaters!<br /><br />I have Celiacs disease and cannot eat gluten or I get very ill. I have NEVER gotten ill from these brownies!  This means they are 100% gluten free and safe for those on gluten free diets.<br /><br />NOTE: Be careful to not overcook them! It can happen quickly if you are not being observant and dry or burnt brownies are not very palatable = P<br /><br />BEST STORAGE: Do not leave them out on the counter, in a cookie jar, or in the fridge.  Gluten free foods dry out quickly. Instead you should cut them into squares while still a little warm and freeze them. Then you can defrost fresh nummy brownies whenever you would like to eat them!<br /><br />I consider these the best brownies i have ever eaten and the only brownies I will ever buy.

review/text: Wonderfully tasty brownies for those of us who can't have glutens in our diet.  These are so good, very moist, great taste and I can't tell them from the regular brownies I use to make from scratch.  I add about 1/2 cup of chopped nuts sometimes to the mix and so far not one person that I have shared these with can tell any difference from regular brownies.  One friend actually ask me for my recipe and when I told her what they were she didn't believe that they were gluten free.  Will be back to buy more of these for sure.

review/text: This mix makes the best brownies, you can not even tell they are gluten free. My husband would not even try them when I said they were gluten free. I put a bite in his month and then he proceeded to eat 2 more brownies.

review/summary: You won't miss the wheat, but you may want some ice cream to go with it!
review/text: Believe the reviews--this is seriously awesome--I didn't miss the wheat at all, better than the mixes I've used that had gluten beyond a doubt--the only thing its missing is a scoop of vanilla ice cream!  I am a newly diagnosed Celiac, and am so grateful I have something to bake and share with friends and family!

review/summary: Tasty but Crumbly
review/text: These are tasty enough.  Indeed, if you mix in a tablespoon of raspberry jam or a half-teaspoon of cinnamon, these are QUITE tasty.  But they have no cohesion.  We try to cut them, and they crumble in the pan.  I know gluten-free baked goods tend to be more crumbly than the conventional stuff, but we made Betty Crocker, and they held together just fine.  As tasty as these are, I can't arrange them on a platter and serve them to my friends.  So I'll stick with Betty for a while, but thanks anyway.

review/summary: NIRVANA!
review/text: After using the Gluten Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread mix for some time (and loving it), I decided to check out other Gluten Free Pantry mixes.  I have been using the Betty Crocker Brownie Mix for over a year and have had mixed (no pun intended) and often disappointing results.  Well, I am SO glad that I gave this one a try!  The brownies are chocolate-y and just the right consistency when baked for the amount of time recommended on the package (I never knew with the Betty Crocker brownies...sometimes they were done, sometimes they weren't).  I don't have to add extra chocolate chips to this mix to get the richness I want in a chocolate brownie.  Another plus is that this mix works just as well with substitutions (I use canola oil instead of butter).  I even baked one batch using applesauce and yogurt instead of oil (moist, fat, brownies were the result).  I like that I can "de-fat" them if I want to do so!  I've tried almost every GF brownie mix on the planet and this one is the BEST!  One strange recommendation in the directions is that you freeze the brownies for an hour for best results.  Since I am always in a hurry when I bake these, I haven't done that as yet, but, it hasn't seemed to be a problem!

review/text: I was skeptical of this mix because I enjoyed the Betty Crocker version.  However, after tasting this version, I would definitely recommend it over the Betty Crocker mix.  Absolutely delicious!  The original version is not low-fat, but there is a lower fat recipe on the box so I am looking forward to trying that recipe.  I can tell no difference between this and gluten filled.  All in all, a big YUM!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I bought the six pack case and after baking the first two boxes I am confident that I won't be purchasing this again. If you are looking for chocolate decadence, you won't find it here. The next box I will try with regular oil not melted butter/margarine as directed. Maybe then I'll get that chewy, gooey richness that this products claims. There is a strange aftertaste, not one that I wish to linger. Betty Crocker G/F brownie mix is by far a better tasting brownie and less expensive. My vote is G/F with Betty C!

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: These are soooooooo delicious!  I just baked these this evening and they were a huge hit.  We all agreed that they taste just as good if not better than some of the best wheat flour brownie mixes out there.  They were moist and very rich with a crunchy (but not hard, just right) top. I cut back a little on the margarine.  It calls for 7 tablespoons of butter but instead I used 4 tablespoons of Earth Balance with 3 tablespoons of applesauce.  Also, I baked them in cupcake liners because I like to freeze them and take them out as needed.  It tasted perfect this way but I can't comment on how this modification compares to the original recipe since I haven't tried it the other way.  I will be sure to stock my pantry with this mix!

review/summary: Took Top Honors
review/text: We have been baking these brownies for several years as I have a gluten-free son who is the pickiest of eaters.  If there was a change to the recipe when the company was acquired by Glutino, it did not affect its taste to our family!<br /><br />These are fudgey and chewy not at all dry or cake-like.  We tried freezing them to make them last longer, but they are just as good if not better frozen.  We cut ours after baking and freeze them already cut in a zip-lock bag.<br /><br />A few years ago, an organic living magazine did a taste-test on all brownies and these placed first.  Incidentally, Gluten-Free's chocolate cake mix which used to be called Danielle's decadent cake mix also took first place and it makes the best chocolate cupcakes I have ever eaten!  Try topping them with Pamela's dark chocolate frosting mix. The best!  NO ONE will ever suspect either mix is gluten-free.

review/text: We've tried many brands of GF brownie mix, and this is by far the best. While many others have a powdery mouthfeel, these are rich and chewy and most of all, chocolatey! We also add finely chopped almonds to the mix and bring them along to picnics, bake sales, etc. No one can tell that they are GF! Amazon's subscription price is good, so we'll be buying from here going forward.

review/summary: Great brownie mix (if you're a little creative)
review/text: I can make the best gluten-free brownies you've ever tasted without using a mix.  But that recipe calls for melting chocolate in a double boiler.  It takes multiple mixing bowls.  So, sometimes, for convenience, you want a mix.<br /><br />One box will make an 8" square dish of gluten-free brownies that I readily serve to my wheat-eating friends (and I get very positive feedback).  You want to take the brownies from this mix from "good" into the stratosphere of "awesomeness"?  Here's my tip, stolen from the Paula Deen website.  Mix up the brownie mix.  Pour half into a baking pan.  Chop up a toffee bar (the supersize symphony bar works well) and spread over the bottom half of the batter.  If you're feeling like a super-delicious extra-heavy brownie, just lay down the whole bar and get another half of a second bar to make a complete layer.  Then pour in the other half of the batter and bake according to the directions.  You will soon be eating the best from-a-mix brownie you've ever eaten, gluten-free or otherwise.

review/text: This is the best brownie mix we've found. Too bad Amazon can't keep them in stock. --Or maybe it's a good thing, since I go way over my RDA of sugar and fat whenever we bake a batch. Great to take along on ski trips or long hikes.

review/summary: Awesome brownies
review/text: These Gluten Free brownies are incredible.  They are so rich and moist they almost taste like fudge.  With so many GF products out there that crumble or taste horrible or both, these brownies are about the best GF item I've tried so far.  They are easy to make--it is well worth the effort.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Nice Green Tea Blend, Fine Flavor
review/text: ****<br /><br />This tea is good---it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea, Japanese green tea, Chinese green tea, Assam green tea, Darjeeling green tea, and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its [...] effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas. White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />****

review/text: This mat is worthless. It is tiny and doesn't stay put so the cat still gets litter every where. Like others said the mat is uncomfortable and the cat just jumps over it. So instead of having litter right in front of the box, she tracks it all over the room. Don't buy!

review/summary: cat litter mat
review/text: Finally found this item and was very excited to buy because of its low price and because I have messy kitties. Was happy about the fast shipping but was not happy that I recieved a blue mat when I wanted the silver one pictured. Also it was mailed rolled even though the package it was sent in was large enough to lay it flat. Now it has a kink in it. Overall, I like this product because it does elminate some of the mess the cats track out of the litter box. However, now my kitten, who doesn't want to step on it for whatever reason, just jumps over it when exiting the box. And leaving more litter sprayed over the floor. lol Kittens......

review/summary: It is not large enough
review/text: This product is very cute - I have it in the tan color and the cat graphic is nice. However, it does not cover enough square footage. The narrow end is particularly troublesome. However, it is durable - mine has lasted for two years. Yet because of the mess that inevitably winds up near the mat but not on the mat (because the mat is too small), I will be replacing this item.<br /><br />Additionally, if you are neat freak, you probably won't like this item because certain debris can become tightly lodged in the prongs of this mat - you can clean it with a power hose outdoors, but that will be a pain to do every few days. Just a paper towel and/or a dust pan are not sufficient to thoroughly clean this item.

review/summary: Not Big Enough
review/text: The thick plastic that this mat is made of is really easy to clean, as you can just vacuum up any excess litter.  Some cats may not like the pointed surface of the mat; my cat doesn't seem to mind.  The main problem is that the mat is so small that most of the time my cat ends up exiting from a different side of the litter box, and thus the mat doesn't do any good.  I'm looking to purchase a different mat, because the small size of this one renders it all but useless.

review/text: This product does exactly what it's intended to do. Unfortunately, it is not a very large mat, and my cat just steps out on the side of the litter box sometimes rather than onto the litter mat. However, when he does step out onto the mat, it does a great job of catching the litter off his paws. Good value for the price. Fast shipping!

review/text: This mat is just fine... by me. My cat, on the other hand, avoids it like the plague. It must feel funny to her little toes. I don't think she has stepped on it a single time. Her entire room will be littered with litter (sorry, couldn't resist), but this mat will remain perfectly clean, because she avoids it so religiously. I find myself wondering why I keep using it. I really should just throw it out.<br /><br />I'm sure there are cats out there who might not mind. But, for my cat, this was a no go.

review/text: This mat is so small, and as others have noted, the "turf" is pointy - so it probably hurts cats' paws (it hurts my knees!)  My cat jumps right over it and I end up with litter kicked up all over the place.  Seems like a good concept, but I would bet it doesn't solve most people's problem of trying to contain the litter.<br /><br />I just bought an extra large Petmate Litter Catcher that has 4-1/2 stars.  Hopefully, I'll have more success with that!

review/text: Inexpensive little mat. But it's so small and doesn't help when my cat kicks litter out of anywhere other than right in front of the box. And like others have written its got little spokes poking out so my cat didn't even like to step on it so it made even more of a mess. It needed to be cleaned daily and it was just overall more hassle than the small price tag.

review/summary: Great value!
review/text: With peanut butter prices going through the roof, I've been looking for a more economical way way of buying it in bulk.  We have four kids, and I eat a low carb diet, so we eat a lot of peanut butter.  When I saw this 35-pound bucket offered with free SuperSaver shipping, I leaped!<br /><br />The product itself is very good - just like Fisher's other nuts and products, it has a great flavor, and it's creamy and not too salty.  The lid on the bucket fits well, so I can reseal it after transferring some of it to smaller jars for the kitchen.  It's a little messy having to dip it out that way, but well worth it when I save $1-2 per pound over buying store brand peanut butter at the grocery.  I spray a one cup measuring cup with cooking spray, to keep it from sticking too much, and use a rubber scraper to get it all in the jar without any waste.<br /><br />I notice the price has risen from $60 to $90 since I bought my bucket.  I probably wouldn't have purchased this bucket at $90, but I'll be watching the price and will buy it again when it's a great bargain like when I purchased it.

review/summary: Finally.... I found my tea!
review/text: I see there are no other reviews for this item yet. There need to be! It is great, and with recent changes in Twinings lineup, I'm sure more people like me are out there looking for a good replacement-- so I hope this will be helpful to some who are doing as I have done. I took a blind chance on this tea-- and I am so glad I did. I've been a fan of black currant iced tea ever since I first tried it. For years I used Twinings brand, but they have changed their formula and I have read many negative reviews, so I decided to look for a new brand. I tried several others and Mighty Leaf black currant has been the best so far.  If you are a fan of Twinings Black currant (the original) and/or you like the black currant iced teas served by Jason's Deli or Corner Bakery, you will probably really like this tea as it has a very similar taste. It is slightly stronger and has a little more of a "bite" than Twinings version did, (which I like)  and it is an excellent quality tea all around. There are several brands out there whose interpretation of what black currant tea tastes like is very far removed from this flavor I am familiar with. A few of them I tried were just downright weird. I am not really sure which black currant taste is more "authentic" to be honest, I just know what I like and I am very very happy with this tea. I will be buying this brand from now on for making my iced tea. It is well worth having to order it.

Learned my lesson - pay a bit more at the grocery store for quality jumbo lump crab meat.

review/text: I ordered this product for my wife who remembered these things from childhood. Originally she wanted some Circus Peanuts, but upon seeing this product, she remembered the enjoyment she had as a child. At any rate, the Brach's Chicks & Rabbits was $9.99 for a 10.5 ounce package. I thought this was a little pricy, and could not easily determine how big of a package this actually was, but bought it anyway.<br /><br />We got the candy after a few days with Amazon Prime, but when it came, I was thoroughly disappointed. The package (not shipping material, but actual bag of candy) was in battered condition, but not being punctured, we kept it. The candy itself was very stale - and exactly like Circus Peanuts candy (just a different shape/color).<br /><br />In short, go for the $1.00 package of circus peanuts before spending $10 on this. My recommendation is to buy this product for nostalgia, not enjoyment.
