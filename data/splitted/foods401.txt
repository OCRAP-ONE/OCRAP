review/summary: She'd stand on her head for this!
review/text: I ordered both this type and the Paella for our Akita, and I have to say hands down, this is the only food that she gets excited about about EVERY time. She is a picky eater, and sometimes the other food, has to be put in the refrigerator because I don't want it to spoil. I don't give her this "flavor" all the time though, because I want it to be more of a reward type meal. Have not tried the Kobe flavors yet, but am looking forward to...am waiting for the economy to pick up a bit more to try these ones just in case she is not as crazy about these as she is the pork version.

review/summary: Makes my dogs sick
review/text: While the ingredients look good (though the water content is 80% while most of the better brands have 78%) this food has managed to get two of my dogs sick!  Vomiting and uncontrollable bowel movements.  One dog is 17 yrs old and the other 4 yrs old.  I stopped feeding the older girl this food some time ago but discovered I still had cans so I gave a can to the 4 yr old.  After two days on the food he became sick.  He is now on rice and chicken for the next few days.  I cannot recommend this food to anyone.

review/summary: Healthy food for healthy kitties!
review/text: I switched my kitties to Weruva a few months ago, and I'm so happy with this product. The food looks/smells/feels like actual chicken a human would eat, and the kitties love it. While they've always been healthy cats, their coats have gotten even shinier since I've started feeding them an all-wet diet (including Weruva), and they're maintaining a healthy weight and activity level. I'd highly recommend this food to other pet owners, and Amazon's price (with the free shipping) is the best I've seen.

review/summary: decent dog food, but Fromm's is better
review/text: This brand is not bad, the ingredients are all good. However, compared to Fromm's canned dog food, I was not impressed. There seemed to be more liquid in the can and the can was not as full. Also, my puppy's stool turned more runny after eating this. I did not have this problem with the Fromm's canned food which definitely was more solid and less liquid. I give the company credit for using quality ingredients but the food truly looked more watery and filled with liquid. Maybe that is good for cats but I tried their dog food for our puppy.  I will go back to Fromm's and exchange the remaining cans of Weruva.

review/summary: Worst Shipping EVER
review/text: I love Weruva for my dogs, let me say that up front. I ordered 2 cases of this food, and out of 24 cans FIVE were usable. The rest were so badly dented that they were opened and molded. When I tried to return it, I found that This food has a NO RETURN policy. I ended up paying more than $10.00 a can for those 5 cans. NOT ACCEPTABLE. I have been ordering my dog food through Amazon for some time, and this shipping problem is getting worse. Much of the product arrives dented, but unopened. Instead of throwing money away like this, I will pay a little more and pick it up myself! Buyers, please be aware of this NO RETURN policy!!!!

review/summary: Good food, easy delivery
review/text: I have two small-ish dogs (both should weigh about 12-15 pounds each), who are 9 and 11 years old. Feeding them never used to be an issue; we used a nice quality dry food, and they ate out of one bowl together. A few years ago, though, one of them became dangerously ill, and is now diabetic with heavy cataracts in both eyes, so being sure she gets enough to eat at the right times has become much more important. I mix a quarter of a can with a half cup of our dry dog food for each dog twice a day. This gives both of them the right calories (the other dog is more plump because when food falls, she is the only one who can see it!), and the wet food ensures that my diabetic pup eats everything in her bowl. Amazon's price is better than what I pay locally, and it arrives sooner than what the delivery-by date is.

review/summary: My pup's favorite brand of canned food
review/text: My pup, a corgi/chi mix who rarely gets people food yet somehow is so very picky, LOVES weruva. He has tried other very high quality brands and has now been turning his nose up to those after he has tried this. He has so far tried and loved the paw-lickin chicken, grandma's chicken soup, and wok the dog.  These are especially great if you like to have something to mix in with kibble because they have a good amount of sauce in it, though not too much in my opinion to feel like you're getting jipped.<br /><br />I have not yet purchased them from amazon so I cannot comment on the shipping quality.  Although I have bought online elsewhere and it arrived via fedex, some a little dented but all cans still useable.  Glad to see weruva is on amazon, will have to order from here next time I need to purchase.

review/text: My Cavaliers absolutely love this product.  I give it to my nursing moms to keep weight on them.  Some of them tend to get picky when they're nursing, but this brand of food is always more than appreciated by my little mamas.  :) I would like to explain just a bit further.  My largest expense with my show dogs is for their top quality food, even more costly than our vet expenses!  If my spoiled fur family loves this food, I, for one, am convinced it's a top-notch product. I wish it were cheaper, but all things considered, it's an acceptable price for the quality.

So keep the non-instant brown rice around for those times when time isn't of the essence, and keep this around for when you need a quick, delicious bowl in less than two minutes.  It's really that simple.

review/text: I started a High Fiber diet in order to lose weight/feel better at the beginning of the year. I am not a vegan or vegetarian,just a woman on a busy schedule who is trying to overhaul my eating habits.<br /><br />This is a very good product,easy to take to work,school,etc.It is a lot more convenient than cooking brown rice for close to an hour,especially on nights when you are busy and/or cooking for one.I throw some stir-fry seasoned veggies on top,and just eat it from the bowl.Also,with a little brown sugar,pecans and raisins it makes a great alternative to oatmeal in the mornings.Before this,I had tried Uncle Bens quick brown rice pouches that you microwave,which were nasty--salty ,oily and too much fat. All I can say is just try it,you will be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Wow!  You all were right - this is great stuff!
review/text: First, my sincere thanks to all of the others here who took the time to post a review.  I never would have tried this rice bowl except for the overwhelmingly positive reviews here.  Even so, I really felt like it was a gamble.  So I'm happy to say this stuff is great!  I'm not a big health food nut or anything, but I am trying to eat healthier.  I do like rice, so I was looking for a simple, quick, instant rice type product when I came across this.<br /><br />Yowzer!  This is great stuff.  In my 1000 watt microwave, 60 seconds was all it took and I had a hot, steaming bowl of slightly sticky brown rice that was close to perfect.  For the purposes of this review, I started out eating just the rice "as is" right out of the microwave.  The texture was great and the taste excellent.  Now rice alone does not have a great deal of flavor, but the subtle flavor was very good and exactly how I would want my brown rice to taste.  So all good and I'm already thinking 5 stars for this rice for being so handy, convenient, easy to fix, and tasty.<br /><br />Next I was thinking about having some salsa and chips, and I thought, hmmm...salsa and rice?  So I spooned some medium salsa into my rice bowl and stirred a bit and voila!  A very tasty meal!  I don't think it gets any easier than this.  This stuff will make the perfect base for a variety of tasty meals and fairly healthy ones at that.<br /><br />A big thumbs up and 5 stars for this one!

review/summary: Good rice, incorrect nutritional information
review/text: This rice is super easy to prepare.  I like it with a bit of Frank's Red Hot sauce added.  I'm<br />deducting a star, however, because the nutritional information on the site is wrong.  I dislike nutritional information that divides a single portion serving into fractions on the label but, at the very least, it should be accurate information.<br /><br />The nutritional information above indicates that it is 115 calories per "serving" or 230 per bowl.  When in fact, the label on the bowls indicate that it is really 170 calories per serving or 340 per bowl.

review/summary: Quick and delicious!
review/text: I hesitated buying this product because it's a bit on the pricey side, but I do enjoy brown rice and it's such a pain to cook.  I was impressed by the glowing reviews of this product, and finally decided to take a chance.  I was not disappointed.  The rice is cooked perfectly, and has that wonderful nutty brown rice flavor.  This rice is perfect with steamed veggies when I am not in the mood to cook a decent meal for myself.  I love it!<br /><br />Be sure to note that the serving size is 1/2 bowl when looking at the nutritional information.  I particularly liked the fact that the product is very low in sodium.  Contents of the bowl are listed as Organic Brown Rice, Water, Calcium Carbonate. From that it seems safe to assume that the fat and sodium levels are those found naturally in the rice.<br /><br />I will definitely buy this again.  Yummy!

review/summary: Wonderful Rice
review/text: I have this rice on Subscribe and Save because I like it so well.  It has a wonderful natural flavor, and it's healthy, too.  It is so easy to prepare.  It's delicious as an accompaniment for several regularly prepared dishes - beef stroganoff and stir-fry being two.  I also use it to make rice pudding with raisins and cinnamon.  My favorite, though is this one-pan meal:<br /><br />1. Brown half a pound of hamburger (or veggie burger) with chopped celery and onions until the burger is browned and cooked through.  Drain grease thoroughly. If it is especially greasy I will drain the meat on paper towels before proceeding.  (Other meats work as well - chicken and pork, especially, but use a little olive oil during browning.)<br />2. Add a cup of frozen mixed veggies ( the kind with corn, peas, lima beans and green beans) and a cup of salsa (I like medium Pace best).<br />  Reduce heat and simmer until frozen veggies are cooked.<br />3. Top with grated cheese of choice to just cover, and continue to simmer until cheese melts.<br />4.  Spoon some over half a bowl of the heated rice for each serving.  This recipe makes three servings, or two for big eaters.<br /><br />I don't know what to call this recipe, but it is tasty! And soooo easy!<br /><br />Then-I can't resist mentioning this silly thing - the empty bowl the rice comes in is a favorite toy of my two miniSchnauzers. I toss it for them like a frisbee, sometimes, but most often they play with it by themselves.  One of them enjoys holding the bowl in her mouth, putting one foot in the bowl, then skating the bowl around the room that way.  Craziest thing you ever saw!  The plastic the bowl is made of is tough, and doesn't come apart at all when they chew on it.  Okay, this is goofy, I'll admit, but it is a way of recycling isn't it?  ;-)

review/text: I am not easy to please when it comes to rice, but this stuff is fantastic. The bowls are just right for adding some edaname or chicken to, maybe a dash of chili and wham! my lunch is the envy of everyone at work. Rice is nice and moist, not crunchy or dry at all-- mmm, mmm! The size is probably enough to serve 2 "average" individuals, but hubby and I eat a lot more than the average person (gym people), so this size is perfect as a side dish. I like that the flavor is very mellow, so you can mix it with just about anything (sometimes tofu, sometimes spicy chicken, sometimes organic black beans, sometimes I stir in some organic butternut squash soup).

Use your imagination; but I think you'll be happier using this as a starting point.<br /><br />Then you have a very nice lunch, prepared on a good and easy rice base.

review/summary: Perfect portion size and heats up fast
review/text: Recently I've been looking for a way to include brown rice into my daily diet for the health benefits. I've been trying to cook some, but that doesn't always work when I'm short on time or at work. These steamed brown rice bowls are WONDERFUL for those times when I need something fast. I pre-cook some chicken and have it ready in the refrigerator. So when I need a fast lunch, I spend 90 seconds heating up a bowl of rice and 60 seconds heating up my chicken and instantly I have a super lean healthy lunch, with fresh organic rice instead of stale reheated rice.<br /><br />I appreciate that this brown rice is organic, since there are studies suggesting that non-organic brown rice is suspected to have 1.4 to 5 times more arsenic than organic brown rice. Because of this I always try and buy the organic version.<br /><br />A quick and healthy meal, these microwaveable bowls of brown rice are a terrific way eating a healthy food even when you don't have time to cook it yourself.

review/text: This stuff is FREAKIN AWESOME. I stumbled upon these a month ago, ordered them asap. They got to my house in a week and I've been eating 2 a week since. You don't have to season this or anything, it's perfect straight out of the microwave.<br /><br />Making brown rice in a pot is a bit of a hassle--not nearly as easy as making white rice. It takes a long time and it's hard to get a decent texture (not too mushy, not dry). This takes all the guesswork out of eating healthy. 90 seconds in the microwave and you have 2 servings of brown rice. I'm seriously never buying brown rice any other way.<br /><br />If you're even considering buying this, DO IT.

review/summary: Very good rice
review/text: I gave this 5 stars because it is exactly what it is advertised as - brown rice. I am trying to eat more healthy and as a result, have to push my palate a bit. While I can't imagine trying to eat this alone, this rice has been very good combined with other stronger flavored ingredients. I had this with fresh grilled salmon combined in it and with just a bit more seasoning of the rice, it was a very good and filling meal. I love that in 90 seconds I can have a healthy addition to any meal. Brown rice is not something I have the time or patience to try and learn to cook and it would almost double the time it takes to put most meals I prepare on the table. The rice bowls are small enough to be an individual meal, but 2 bowls is enough to have a nice healthy side dish for my family to enjoy with meals. The price, especially with subscribe and save, is very much in line with what you pay in the grocery store for other microwave rice dishes, if not cheaper.<br />With this product, I see brown rice become a much larger part of our diet (especially because we had not incorporated it into our diet in the past). The flavor was mild, slightly nutty, and the sticky texture was really pleasing. A great product and it is nice to see healthier options enter the convenience food market.

review/text: Our family loves these rice bowls! We have a rice cooker for making white rice, but it takes forever to cook the brown rice, so we found that these bowls are an easy and convenient way to have brown rice with our dinner.<br /><br />You don't have to store them in the refrigerator and you just microwave them for 90 seconds. It's so easy and quick to pop this in the microwave once the rest of the meal is ready.<br /><br />Note that it is ONLY rice. There are no added flavors, so they're not meant to be a meal in themselves. (I noticed that people who gave it low ratings said that they don't taste good because there's no flavorings. I guess they thought it was supposed to be a meal?)<br /><br />They are very tasty with the nutty flavor that distinguishes brown rice from white. I would definitely recommend this product!

review/summary: brown rice
review/text: I must say the rice is easy to make and good tasting. The only problem I had was with the calories. On the advertisement it states, 115 calories per serving, but on the label of the product it says 155. Being that Im watching my weight this could be a problem. I bought the product thinking that the calories was within my limits, only to find that I was understating it.

review/summary: Delcious and Easy!
review/text: We got hooked on this delicious, heat-and-serve brown rice when Costco sold it . . . then they stopped carrying it (at least in our area - on vacation earlier this year in Hawaii, we found it at Costco in Kona and brought back 2 boxes . . .) It just has the perfect texture: slightly chewy, not dry, not soggy - and perfectly delicious! We heat it in the microwave or pan saute with mushrooms, onions, and seasonings. Even our teenage boys have been converted from ordinary white rice to brown - much better nutrition for all of us.

review/text: This brown rice is some of the best I have tasted.  The consistency and quality are excellent.  Cooking raw brown rice can be challenging in my experience; either it comes out crunchy or mushy, which makes this brown rice so convenient, easy, and delicious.  For breakfast, I just add milk, raisins, and cinnamon; for lunch, add steamed veggies and tamari (low sodium, organic); for dinner, add shrimp, shallots, and peas.  Cannot beat the price, either.

review/summary: I am a vegan and love his rice
review/text: Sticking to a vegan diet is difficult if you are hurried for a meal.  It only takes 90 seconds in the microwave for this Steamed Brown Rice Bowl to heat up.  This rice has a good nutty flavor and it is the same quality as the name brand at a lot less.  At $1.50 a serving (subscribe and save - this makes a very thrifty and healthy meal.<br /><br />I add salsa or black beans or Indian chick peas or bean soup...you name it.  I have a rice cooker and hardly use it. This steamed brown rice bowl does the trick with a lot less hassle.  If you are concerned with the plastic, you can remove it and heat it in a sealed bowl.

review/summary: Makes rice EASY!
review/text: My wife and I have been using these for quite a while, and they are now a major part of our diet.  We used to avoid rice because, quite frankly, it was tough to cook.  Even with a steamer.  These are not cheap, but for organic brown rice with no boiling, overcooking, or time, they can't be beat.<br /><br />And they're tasty to boot!  If you're looking to go Gluten free, or to manage blood sugar, this is a great way to add brown rice to your diet.<br /><br />I do wonder about the whole plastic container in the microwave thing, but I'll overlook it for the convenience!

review/summary: Tasty but like breaking into Fort Knox
review/text: First, I would have been overjoyed to just give this 5 stars.  It's got good texture and flavor being slightly sweet with a meaty consistency.  It cooks perfectly in the microwave although I've never tried the boiling method.  I use it for all sorts of meal bases.  You could just eat it plain though.  It's that good.<br /><br />The batch I just went through though was a real trial to get into.  I've ordered this brand before with no troubles but this batch (all dozen) was a real pain to open.  You are supposed to just vent the lid by peeling it back slightly before you microwave it but that was pretty much impossible.  The seal between the top and the bowl was so strong, you just couldn't.  I ended up just cutting the top free.  I've got to tell you, microwave packaging isn't generally much of a challenge for me but this was.  Just beware it's possible that, if you have a physical infirmity, this packaging might be a challenge.

review/text: I was a bit skeptical about precooked rice in a microwave bowl, but I was pleasantly surprised. The grains are separate and perfectly cooked, and no need for messing around with the rice cooker or washing a pot.  I've also used this in a stove-top casserole, where I added it at the end and allowed a few minutes for it to heat through- it separated nicely.  It's short grain brown rice, for those who want to know that !!  I plan to try other items of this brand, and buy this item again :)

review/summary: Tasty, fast, and convenient
review/text: I like these brown rice bowls.  The rice is delicious and brown rice is good for you. I prefer brown rice to white rice because it is a whole grain, with brown bran layer intact, so it has fiber and antioxidants not found in white rice.  These bowls contain plain brown rice (no herbs or flavoring), so you can do whatever you want with it.  It cooks very quickly so I like taking it with me to work as lunch side dish.<br /><br />This rice take 90 seconds to prepare. By comparison regular brown rice takes 40 to 50 minutes to cook. Regular price costs about 17 cents per once, and Gogo rice bowls in this 12-pack package cost 23 cents per ounce.  This seems like a pretty fair price for convenience of speedy cooking, with the taste being practically as good as slow cooking rice to my taste buds.<br /><br />If there is a problem with this product and for some reason can not get satisfaction from Amazon, you can search for the company on the internet, they will replace the product directly.<br /><br />Overall, I like the taste and convenience of these brown rice bowl and recommend them.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

Also no heating of the house, making it perfect for warm weather and the single rice-eater :-)

review/text: I first found microwavable, organic, brown rice at Costco. They stopped carrying it and I found this brand on Amazon. We use it as a staple of our diet now. Incredibly easy...really is done in 90 seconds. The taste is great, kind of a nutty-rice flavor. It can be a bit sticky. One relative of mine does not like microwaving in plastic, such as the bowl the rice comes in. It also works fine to move the uncooked rice to a bowl, add a few drops of water, cover and microwave for 90 seconds. We get 12 bowls delivered each month to take advantage of the quantity discount. Most months we're nearly out when the new shipment arrives.

review/text: I haven't been able to find any coffee flavored syrups in area supermarkets for years now, so I ordered this product.  The flavor is good, although I wouldn't mind if the syrup was a little thicker, especially when used on ice cream.  I enjoy mixing it in a glass of low-fat milk, adding a shot or less of Kahlua or Tia Maria, and putting it in the freezer for several hours.  Makes a tasty frozen treat.<br /><br />I especially want to thank the Amazon seller from whom I purchased this product.  In addition to shipping the six squeeze bottles in a cardboard box, Lil-BigShots took the time to wrap them in pairs inside protective bubble-wrap mailing envelopes.  I've had some products from Amazon sellers arrive in poor condition, and I appreciate the extra time and effort taken by this seller.

review/text: I used to buy Camp Coffee (Chicory and coffee essence) in England, and that stuff was lovely! I found this in a small store today, and thought I would try it as I really miss Camp. I'm drinking it now and it is bloody awful (which I should have known) because it is sweetened with corn syrup. I do not understand how anyone in this country - USA - can find it acceptable to have everything sweetened by foul CORN SYRUP which tastes DIFFERENT to sugar and leaves a weird feeling?/taste in ones mouth. If you demand real sugar, then you probably won't like this product.
