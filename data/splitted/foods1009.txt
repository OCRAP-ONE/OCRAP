review/summary: Great flavor of SA, fine tea!
review/text: As an American who traveled to Cape Town, SA two years ago for business, I picked this tea up for my wife as a 'bit of the flavor' of the country as several of my Cape Town peers suggested it. When I brought it home I was glad that she enjoyed it as much as I had hoped. Well, the fall is here now and we reached for the vacuumed sealed tea box and we where both sorry to see we only had a few bags left. I'm so very happy to find this product here. I'll be getting a few more boxes to surprise her!

review/summary: Not as good as the organic
review/text: While it does have the flavor, it also has an after taste that the organic product does not.  The fair trade organic version is a little more costly, however their process is different and it gives a crisper cleaner taste than this product offers.  I thought I could save a little money, turns out like most things, you get what you pay for.  Equal Exchange carries the organic, fair trade verison if you want to try it)

review/summary: My favorite tea!
review/text: My husband and I did a safari in South Africa in August'09 and I had some rooibos experience here in the States but it was always mixed with something else.  Freshpak is what the South African's buy.  It has a great flavor and is cheap even here!  I picked up Lipton's Rooibos while in SA but I found I liked Freshpak much better.  That tea became my friend there as I did have a day of being under the weather, it made me feel better.  The people there swear by it.  A little honey, some lemon and you can drink it all day.  I brought tea for family and friends here but I haven't heard if they have even tried it....might have to steal it all back!  :)  Down to my last bags...need to buy more!

review/summary: The best decaffinated tea anywhere!
review/text: I discovered this product on a trip to South Africa and have found nothing else like it, even other so-called "red bush" teas sold by other companies.  This tea is entirely distinctive, subtle and delicious and has no caffeine.  Unlike many decaff teas, it is not fruity or sweet.  It has a slightly smokey flavor, a bit like Lapsang Souchong, but no bitterness at all.  It makes a great pot of tea for any time of day or night and tastes great iced.  I was so amazed to find I could buy it outside of the one South African restaurant I know of.  Hooray for Amazon!  I buy it two boxes at a time.

review/summary: Perfect Morning Tea (Caffeinated)
review/text: *****<br /><br />Numi Tea's Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified organic high mountain Yunnan Black Tea FOP (Flowery Orange Pekoe). There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "This noble tea is grown in the mist covered mountains of Yunnan province. What distinguishes this fine, organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance, exquisite tiger's eye color, and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day. Like a complex wine, it is the perfect tea for food, marrying well with a wide variety of dishes. It has a distant and hard to place floral quality, yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water. And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees. We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf."<br /><br />Although this tea says "orange pekoe", it does not taste citrus-y, but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones.  It is like a regular orange pekoe upgraded many, many times, with something delicate, lovely, and flowery added.  It's the perfect morning tea, or for anytime you want a high-quality pick-me-up.<br /><br />The price is super, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love regular black, this will probably be the best you've ever had, and you'll wonder why you ever drank the "old stuff"!<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Unusual, delicate yet flavorful.  I began developing cravings for it!
review/text: This is the perfect tea for breakfast or any time of the day. Numi's Yunnan Black tea has a distinctive aroma with a strong apricot top-note fortified by a nice oaky, grassy base. The brewed tea flavor is clean and yet complex, slightly rich. There is a an very slight edge of tannin which perfectly contrasts the subtle woodsy and floral flavors. Excellent with a dash of cream. Unfortunately Numi does not list the amount of caffeine it contains on the box. It appears to have less caffeine than the usual English breakfast from its effect on this taster.<br /><br />Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. The boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees, reduce landfill by 131,200, and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions. Numi uses only 100% natural ingredients without added oils or "natural flavorings".

review/summary: Smells like a barnyard
review/text: I'm a big tea drinker.  I grew up in a tea drinking home- my grandmother always seemed to have a pot on the stove.  But all teas are clearly not equal.  And this is one of my least favorite black teas that I've had.  I thought that Chinese Breakfast sounded delicious, but I've noticed strong grassy notes.  At first I thought it was the milk we get.  We drink grass-fed milk for our daughters (Farmer's Creamery) that tastes amazing.  I thought we had gotten a batch of particularly grassy milk- but nope.  The Numi Chinese Breakfast tastes very grassy by itself, and it smells fairly unpleasant.  I'd say like a barnyard.  I don't mind the smell of a barnyard, I just don't want that of my tea.  I've tried most other Numi teas, like the Golden Chai (which is a spiced Assam) and the Honeybush, and they are , admittedly better.  They are about the quality of, say, Tazo.  That's to say they are not much better than regular black tea bags like Lipton or P.G. Tips.  And compared to Two Leaves and a Bud (delicious!) or even Lipton Black Pearl, Numi is not nearly as enjoyable.  That is especially true of the Chinese Breakfast.  I have 36 Chinese breakfast teabags and I will drink it all. I just won't be buying any more after that.

review/text: I fell in love with sumac after using it at a Persian restaurant.  I had to ask what it was, and then I found that some of the international groceries in my area didn't carry it, so Amazon is the way to go.  I tried Zamouri sumac first, which was amazing.  I am trying to reduce my sodium intake, and its a good replacement for salt on popcorn as well as for its traditional uses on rice, etc.  After finishing 4oz, I thought I'd look for a good deal in shakers and saw this.  Sumac is sumac, right?  This sumac is ok, but neither as tart nor as flavorful as Zamouri's, at least not the batch I got.  I'll enjoy it, but do plan on getting my favorite next time.

review/summary: Great find, good as is, very good with just a little work
review/text: My wife and I have been very pleased with this purchase. This is a great tasting, truly easy meal. Bring to a boil then simmer 20 minutes. There are a number of different vegetables and a great spice mixture. And not too much salt, but I would not call it low salt.<br /><br />We add a little chicken (pre-cooked after it reaches a boil) and finish it off with cheese and sour cream. Also for me I add a little pepper flakes, but my wife likes it as is. A hearty, quick, easy meal, good flavor profile, and fairly healthy. As a hint go to the gold box page. Look at the top and you will see a coupon tab. Now when you are reading this review it may not apply at all, but we had an 'Amazon coupon' that gave additional savings. In any case you might never have known that tab was there, so check it out. It might lead you to great finds like this one. We have already ordered another variety and are looking forward to that as well. Recommended.

review/summary: My sister's favorite soup!
review/text: Leonard Mountain 3 Amigos Enchilada Stew is my sister's favorite soup---so easy to make and quite tasty.  I met the nutritionist and her husband at an arts festival in Maryland a couple of years ago where they were providing samples of their soup products.  Can't go wrong with this product.  Keep them in my pantry for quick suppers.  Top with sour cream, cheddar cheese, black olives, and whatever you like!

You can add just about anything from canned/dried beans,  fresh or frozen vegetable, and you get a lot of bang for your buck since you can really stretch with stew with lots of easy additions to serve a big crew.

Both my puppy and mature dog, LOVE these biscuits, and I am confident that they are made of the finest ingredients.  I had some in my pocket while I was in the barn, and my horse started nuzzling my pocket, so I gave him one, and he loved them too!  All natural ingredients make this an appealing treat for horses and dogs alike.  Thanks, puppy-mama, for turning us on to Wellness Wellbars!

review/summary: Good Ingredients & The Dogs Love Them
review/text: I have respect for the Wellness brand and have previously bought my dogs other Wellness treats.  These WellBars are marketed as "bite size."  My corgis love them!  And, they can certainly eat them in one bite.  But, for a medium dog, I consider these larger than bite size.  Luckily, the bars are easily broken in two to provide a smaller snack.  (Weight maintenance is a high priority with my chow hounds.)<br /><br />Each bar has 24 calories.  The first few ingredients are:  ground barley, cane molasses, ground brown rice, whitefish, and sweet potatoes.  There's no wheat, corn, soy, artificial preservatives/color/flavor.<br /><br />This is a big box of treats.  I do wish that the bag was resealable, but that's a quibble.

review/text: Both of my dogs love these bars.  They smell good too - like apples.  Wellness has a reputation for using quality ingredients, and the ingredient list for these bars is no exception.<br /><br />Eating these bars made one of my dogs itch, though.  He does have some food allergies (corn & wheat), so I didn't detract from the treats' rating.  My best guess is that he reacted to the cane molasses because he's never eaten it before.

review/summary: Bad for teeth
review/text: Wellness is the brand I go to for dry and wet food for my dog, so I thought I'd try the chicken and cheddar bars.  The second ingredient is cane molasses... I honestly don't know why this is, and it seems odd.  As soon as you open the bag inside the box, you get a whiff of an overwhelming sweetness.  After my dog has one, he's constantly trying to get the caked treat off of his back molars.  It sticks on pretty hard.  I have to help or I have to brush his teeth to get rid of it.  This can't be good for his teeth, and I don't know if he needs the extra sweetness in his diet.  I would recommend Old Mother Hubbard wheat-free treats, such as chicken and apples, before this.  They're also made by Wellness.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B9GNPM">Old Mother Hubbard Classic Oven Baked Chick' N' Apples Dog Biscuits</a> Or, Get Naked dog biscuits, which are also very good.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L80MZ2">Get Naked Super Antioxidant Biscuits for Dogs, 12-Ounce</a>

review/text: This smells so good . Doesnt' smell like cardboard boxes. Comes in thick plastic bag to prevent puncture and letting the freshness go out.  There's no sealable zipper or anything so I have to use a clothing pin.<br /><br />My dog eats it when she wants to.  I leave it next to her bed she won't touch it sometimes. But sometimes she does eat it up.  She should eat it up fast or else it will become stale.<br /><br />Smells fruity and a hint of gingersnap cookies.  I gave it to another dog and he ate it like there was no tomorrow.  I gave my dog a wellness lamb jerky .. she ate it like crazy. I gave the other dog lamb jerky... he ate it like crazy.<br /><br />My conclusion is that not all dogs like fruity gingersnap cookies. Still have 60% left.<br /><br />Wellness brand is very good but I should stick to a guarantee treat....the lamb or any line meat jerky offered by Wellness.<br /><br />Not sure if I can eat it . lol

review/text: First Impression: Well the kind folks over at Wellness Pet Food heard about my website and sent me some treats to try! They ended up sending me a big box of their WellBars that have Yogurt, Apples, and Bananas in them. Totally vegetarian, oven baked with lots of vitamins! I'm sure you have read one of my other reviews about Old Mother Hubbard, they make outstanding healthy treats. Turns out that WellNess is owned by Old Mother Hubbard. Who knew? As usual Dad ran me though a barrage of tests to see how much I really wanted the treat. Let's just say I had to work very hard. Those silly "sit ups" that little dogs do, roll over, sit, stay, down, etc, just to have him put the treats in my Everlasting Treat Ball! I made short work of it and devoured my new delicious and healthy treats. The only thing I'm a little disappointed about is I found out that they have WellBites that are soft treats. They even have one that's Lamb and Salmon flavored... Those are two of my favorite things in the world. Now I have to talk Dad into buying them for me...<br /><br />Conclusion: Outstanding healthy dog treats! A must buy for a healthy pup.

review/text: We can't change our dog's diet much.  Unfortunately he is highly food motivated and loves to visit our local hardware for treats.  In fact, he keeps a supply at the hardware.  He had never been diagnosed with any food allergies but after buying a large box of commercial treats to keep at the hardware, we started to notice some problems.<br /><br />A local pet store recommended another flavor of these treats.  He liked them but we didn't notice an improvement in his symptoms so I tried these.  After all, apples and yogurt are some of my boy's favorite things!<br /><br />He loves these treats.  Although his symptoms have not cleared up entirely, they did improve.  His friend at the hardware likes to feed him a lot of treats at once so we consider them well tested at this point and we just ordered our third box.  Dogs like 'em and mom approves!

review/summary: The clam chowder for people who hate clam chowder!
review/text: Do you suffer from flavor intolerance? Are you recovering from major surgery? Or maybe you just hate yourself. If so, then this is the clam chowder for you. Imagine a rich, creamy, thick soup with tons of clams. Now, forget that because this junk has nothing to do with clam chowder. The "soup" is flavorless because there's no fat. It's the consistency of fat-free milk. The potatoes taste like nothing. What clams there are are the size of toenail clippings. No amount of salt can give this slop flavor. Avoid at all costs.

review/summary: Incredibly fragrant, but not of chai
review/text: While I was very excited to see an herbal chai variety available on Amazon, I was let down by the product itself. After my doctor told me to cut our black tea (something about caffeine), I was anxiously waiting for this product to arrive. As soon as you open the bag, the smell hits you, FLOWERS! And you think, flowers? That can't be right.  It was overwhelming, but I decided that it was concentrated  . . .to make up for the caffeine?<br /><br />But once you brew it, no better. It certainly would work much better at spicing up a room than a beverage. I tried mixing it with other, more simple herbal teas, hoping to tame the flower power. Sadly it didn't work. There just isn't enough cinnamon and cardamon in this mix when compared to the floral notes to make it still be chai. Needs more spice, less flower.

Having purchased before and expecting at least 6 packages of rice, I was very frustrated to see only one.  For the price of $6.75 fo one packet.  I would say this was a rip off.

Too bad it's impossible to find in the grocery stores near me.  I have to purchase it on line and usually get a year's supply. Try it!

review/summary: They don't work when you drink the whole bottle...
review/text: Okay, these things are horrible...when you drink the entire bottle. I wondered why sometimes they worked wonders and other times they nearly killed me (by nausea).<br /><br />Unlike other energy drinks, these are harsh. You must eat something before you drink it and you MUST NOT drink the entire bottle in one sitting. If you do, you may feel tired and sick! You can however, drink the whole bottle in a day, just wait a couple hours before you drink the second serving and you will be good to go.<br /><br />These things also taste great (at least to me). They are tart and have a refreshing kick (the triple berry flavor).<br /><br />Easy steps for maximum effect:<br /><br />-Eat a mid-sized snack or meal<br />-Drink only HALF the bottle<br />-Enjoy the high<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone suffering from the devastating effects of accounting classes!!

review/summary: The ONLY energy drink that works.
review/text: I discovered Redline by accident and am glad to this day that i did discover it. I have tried every energy drink on the planet and non work, I'am able to drink 5 Redbulls and still feel nothing. Redline on the other hand WORKS! It has a great taste, tastes super sweet when its warm. If you ever need a quick energy rush Redline is for you, sip it over time to get an intermediate energy hype or slam the bottle and in about 20 minutes you will be bouncing off the walls and will not be able to stop. The only problem is if you do slam it after about 2 hours you'll crash pretty hard, but to counter that drink a lot of water and eat spoon fulls of peanut butter (not joking). All in all Redline works unbelievable wanders for those in need of amazing amount of energy, this stuff should be sold illegally in alley ways its so powerful. What could it hurt to just try it?

review/summary: Best Energy Drink I've Found
review/text: I've tried quite a few different energy drinks and Redline is the one that works best for me. The only thing I would change is to remove the Yohimbine because it causes jitteriness in larger amounts. That can be mostly avoided though by sipping small amounts over a longer period of time rather than drinking a lot at once. That also minimizes any energy crash effect. The taste is quite good as well.

review/summary: Great product--make sure to read the label!
review/text: I love this drink--I work full-time and go to school, and sometimes it's the only thing that keeps me on task.  It's also great right before a workout.  The taste is acceptable; I think it's a little lighter and sweeter than Red Bull, without the fizz.<br /><br />Warning: This is NOT just a variation of Red Bull or Monster--it's many times more potent.  The label lists it as a dietary supplement, not an energy drink.  I recommend starting with 1/4 bottle or less on a full stomach, to see how you tolerate it.  I rarely drink more than 1/2 bottle per day.<br />I've seen a lot of "reviews" that say that Redline is dangerous, because they had a bad experience; read further and they invariably say they didn't read the label before using it.  If you ignore the label (and the cap warning you to read the label) and drink a full bottle on an empty stomach, you will probably go to the hospital.  You might even die.  Of course, you could say the same thing about Motrin.  You have to use it responsibly.<br /><br />As for the 24-pack, I like it--I was going through a 4-pack every week or so, and they ran me $10 or more.  The 24-pack will save you a lot if you use the product regularly.

review/text: I've tried many energy drinks. This one is like no other.<br /><br />I bought mine at a convenience store. I was looking for something strong to finish up my paper after a pretty long night out.<br /><br />On the label they said '2 servings per bottle'. I have to admit I smiled and downed the whole damn thing.<br /><br />I could not believe how jacked up I was. That thing is *wild*. I don't know what they put in it, but let me tell you folks this is the absolute sh@t.<br /><br />The only problem is (1) sleep disruption --- got to work your tolerance up --- (2) potential crash after the effects have expired (3) a bit expensive.<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars, totally worth it, one the sickest pick-me-ups out there.

review/summary: Death Bottled Me Some of Its Blood... And I Love It!
review/text: The title says it all, really. It works. Though its effects are different on different people (for instance, I don't get the "shiver feeling"), it wakes you up and keeps you awake. I haven't tried taking more than 1 bottle a day and I strongly advise against it, as it has enough caffeine to permanently damage your body, but really, one bottle is more than enough. I'll take a little sip in the morning, another in the afternoon, and one on my hour-long drive home in traffic (Love L.A., Hate the Traffic). This usually leaves me with half a bottle to 2/3s of a bottle left.<br /><br />Its taste is kind of strong, and you can tell it's a bunch of chemicals altogether, so if you can't stand it, I suggest pouring half a bottle of this into a 20oz cup of Sprite or another tangy, citrus soda. If you don't like soda, maybe some fruit juice or something. You really only need a little bit to wake yourself up and stay awake for a while and I'm not sure that much caffeine all at once is good for you anyways. Then again, we're talking about blood from the God of Death here, so if you really value your health over everything else, I don't suggest taking this at all. Not that I'm suicidal or anything, but I've got work to do. 14 hours worth. 6 days a week.<br /><br />I've been encountering this more and more at gas stations, so please, before you buy a whopping 24 bottles' worth here (VERY GOOD DEAL), try one first. See how you do with it. And please don't try it on an empty stomach. (I have, with no weird effects, but that's just me. I don't recommend anyone else try.)

I felt somehow lightheaded while I was walking home. Then, about 10 minutes later, after getting home, I had another quarter. My heart started racing, and suddenly I had a bowel movement. When I came out of the bathroom, I felt a little better. Then, I took plenty of water to flush it down. In total, I just had half a bottle, but it still was too strong for me. I was lucky that I read the direction before opening the bottle, but the direction on the bottle was not clear and I am afraid that it is unreadable for some people.

review/text: I bought one of these to try after reading something online about how it works great and has no crash.  Cautiously, I drank a small sip from a bottle.  Probably less than a 16th of the two serving bottle.  Very soon I was tweaking quite extremely and my friend noticed how irritable I had become from the drink.  However, it did seem to wear off a few hours later without a crash.  I gave it a tentative try the next day, only drinking a tiny sip twice during the day.  Similar effect, so far so good.  The third day I tried a tiny sip in the morning and developed an excruciating headache and nausea that has lasted for two days now.  I feel extremely overwired and unable to come down from it.  Very very sick.  I feel horrible still two days later and I hope I improve soon.

I have used dry yeast in 2 previous batches, Wyeast in an American wheat I just brewed, and White Labs liquid yeast in a raspberry cream ale I just did. The problem with White Labs is that it comes in a test tube looking vial, and you really have no idea if the yeast is ok. With the smack pack, it inflates to show you the yeast is healthy and incubated. I will use only Wyeast from now on!!

review/summary: Suprisingly good.
review/text: Walden Farms salad dressings are a hit and miss.  Some of them are a bit off, and some of them are really good, so I decided to try 'Asian' and was delighted.  Wasn't sure what I was expecting, but the taste is very much like soy sauce with a slightly thicker consistency.  I love to pour it over chicken or fish and then pop it in the oven.  The only downsides have nothing to do with the quality/taste.  1, Sodium.  This is to be expected with most salad dressings.  If you eat it in moderation it shouldn't be an issue, but since it's zero calorie, some people think it's ok to pile it on.  This isn't the case.  2, Price.  The price tag might turn off the average consumer, but for me it's a trade off for the taste that I love and the zero calories/zero sugar advantages.<br /><br />If you're curious, and just want to try it out, I say go for it.  If you're a dieter and are looking for a serious way to cut calories, I say DEFINITELY try it out.

review/text: I won't eat most light or fat free dressings because if you read the label, what they take out, they generally replace with sugar and sugar spikes my appetite big time and yet, a 1 TBS serving of my favorite regular Hidden Valley Ranch dressing doesn't even begin to cover my salad the way I'd like. I'd need at least 3 TBS to make it how I want and that's just too much fat for one meal. It's almost the RDA for an entire day so that's not really feasible for me.<br /><br />What to do??<br /><br />I was THRILLED to find this dressing at my local supermarket. I think it tastes "okay" right out of the bottle but to my tastebuds, it does leave something to be desired. To make it into something I look forward to eating, I do the following:<br /><br />Hidden Valley Ranch has such a strong flavor so I can take 1 TBS of it, 2 TBS of Walden Farms Ranch dressing and approximately 2 TBS of water. Mix well and I have enough dressing for a good sized salad - about 1.5 to 2 cups of greens and it tastes GOOD to me. I don't feel at all deprived and I'm getting fewer calories (there are 70 calories in 1 TBS of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing) and it's plenty thick for what I want it to do and that's cover the salad. I don't want it drenched exactly but I want that ranch flavor with every bite. I eat this dressing almost exclusively now on any kind of salad - turkey taco, chef, asian greens, etc.<br /><br />Sometimes I'll add 1 TBS of flaxseed oil to the mix to get the benefit of the omega 3's however, be aware that 1 TBS of flaxseed oil has approximately 120 calories in it so if you're watching calories then take that into consideration.<br /><br />The above recipe is also not a bad dip for veggies though it is somewhat thin in consistency. I like it best on salads.
