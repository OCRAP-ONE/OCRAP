review/summary: The best flavored k cup of decaf coffe I've tried so far!
review/text: I really wanted to pick up a box of decaf k cups for those times when you come home late after a long day and want a cup of coffee but don't want the jolt of caffeine keeping you up all night.  I tried a few of the options in a sample box we got with our Keurig machine, but they all either tasted rancid or flavorless.  I did my research online and read a bunch of reviews for Van Houtte's decaf hazelnut option and decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />Those reviews didn't lie or exaggerate: this stuff is awesome.<br /><br />Even standing alone as a flavored cup of coffee, this blend is delicious.  Add to the fact it is decaffeinated and that is even more impressive.  This has a bold, full body to it and is quite enjoyable.  Definitely satisfies my craving on colder evenings.<br /><br />Sure, unless it's quite late in the day, I'll probably choose another blend over this one every time, but it's nice to know you have a decaf blend on hand that you don't feel like you just have to settle for when you're faced with the prospect of brewing it.<br /><br />If you need a decaf blend on hand, this is your best bet!

Mix a tablespoon with 1/2-1 cup of water in a squirt bottle, pour it on your head, scrub and wash out. It's weird without suds at first but it does an amazing job! I'd be careful if you color your hair as it will cause fading but as a natural blonde, I love this stuff! Super cheap, no crazy shampoo chemicals and it does the job!

review/summary: The perfect treat for my wedding.
review/text: My two 5-lb bags of Blue Jordan Almonds just arrived, and I am pleased. They taste a little different from the ones at the grocery store: there is an almond flavor in the shell itself, it is crunchier, and the sugar shell seems a little thinner (in a good way, I do not enjoy the jawbreaker quality of the store bought ones).  My final verdict is that they are delicious. The only candy shop in my city that has jordan almonds available in blue, as opposed to a mix of colors, is charging $12.99/lb. These tasty treats from Superior Nut Company came out to $5.39/lb (including tax and standard shipping). They shipped within a week, the color is a beautiful pastel blue, and there was not a single broken piece. I highly recommend this item.

You don't really taste the blueberries per se, as they just set off the lavender, which is subtle and perfect. This is Dagoba and organic chocolate at its best. Not only is it incredibly pleasurable to eat this bar---it's good for you as well, full of anti-oxidants. I'm thrilled that Amazon offers them so affordably in a twelve pack. If you enjoy dark chocolate, you will NOT be disappointed.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

This Latte Candy has a strong creamy-coffee taste (not diluted like many candies) and has a very smooth taste.

The other Bali's Best candies are equally as delicious and have unique flavor profiles.

review/text: We bought this product because we were testing out formulas for my newborn. My wife has to attend school and we wanted some formula on hand in case our baby wouldn't take to a bottle with her breast milk in it. One morning our baby woke up and since my wife hadn't gotten much sleep that night I decided to try it out and see how our little girl liked it. What a big mistake. I prepared the bottle EXACTLY how the instructions on the label say, but as soon as I put the bottle to her mouth and started tipping it, it squirted her in the eye and made a big mess all over her clothes. The same result happened when we tried a couple more bottles. Just goes to show you how much effort they actually put into their product. We will never buy from this company again and we highly recommend everyone to stay far away from Enfamil due to the poor quality and bad experiences we have had with their products.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/08/2011: It turns out that the bottles were defective and had to be recalled due to the rubber part of the nipple not being made thick enough. The company contacted us to apologize and even gave us some coupons for free products. They were a little slow to respond to us, but they treated us with respect and were very helpful. We now use the Enfamil Gentlease and are very pleased with the results

review/summary: Best Affordable Dog Food On The Market
review/text: Without a doubt, Diamond Naturals is the best affordable quality dog food on the market. They sell the 40 pound bags where I live for around $22-25, so I do get it a little cheaper. What makes Diamond Naturals so great is the fact that it does not contain corn, wheat, or soy in the ingredients. Corn and wheat are what causes skin irritation, dryness, loss of hair, and loose stools. All of the other brands around this price contain corn or wheat as their first or second ingredients, like Purina, Iams, Science Diet, Pedigree, and other cheaper brands. Also, Diamond Naturals actually has considerable portions of REAL meat instead of fillers and by-product that the other brands have in them.<br /><br />Is Diamond Naturals the best dog food on the market? No, but some us of cannot afford the $60-70 holistic dog foods. Diamond Naturals rated 4 out of 5 stars on a top dog food review website and a 3 out of 5 stars on another top dog food review site. Some people will say it's a so-so dog food, but do not listen to them. They are quoting from old reviews or they are reading reviews for "Diamond" dog food.<br /><br />My Rottweiler use to eat Purina (bad I know, but I hadn't done the research yet!), but he had loose stools, skin irritation, and had a TON of shedding. When I switched to Diamond Naturals Chicken and Rice, the irritation, loose stools, and the major shedding all stopped.<br /><br />However, the cheaper brand "Diamond" is not of the same quality as "Diamond Naturals," so be sure you have the right brand before you buy. Also, if you're spending $35-40 on this dog food, then i'd upgrade to the Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul dog food which is $40 for 35 pounds.

review/summary: No wheat or corn!!!!
review/text: I SPENT WEEKS RESEARCHING DOG FOODS.IT HAD TO BE FREE OF WHEAT AND CORN,CAUSE SOME GRAINS DON'T AGREE WITH DOGS, IF YOUR DOG HAS A AWFUL SMELL TO HIM, TRY TO ELIMINATE WHEAT AND CORN FROM THIER DIET AND YOU SHOULD NOTICE A DIFFERENCE. SINCE I HAVE THREE DOGS IT HAD TO BE REASONABLY PRICED.DIAMOND NATURALS IS A PREMIUM DOG FOOD MUCH BETTER THAN SOME HIGHER PRICED WELL KNOWN DOG FOODS. MY DOGS LOVE THIS FOOD, THIER COATS ARE SHINY, THEY HAVE MORE ENERGY AND NO LONGER HAVE THAT FUNKY SMELL!!!!!!

review/summary: BEST VALUE
review/text: I've been using Diamond Naturals for almost two years, and it really is the best value on "good" dog food. My local pet food store sells this item for around $40 (incl. tax), so ordering over Amazon is a really good deal, plus it gets delivered to your door, so you don't have to carry a 40 lb bag back and fourth from your car. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade to a no corn no wheat no soy diet for their dog without wanting to spend a lot of money.

review/summary: The best affordable nutrition for your best friend.
review/text: I'm a breeder of Champion Bird Dogs. Our Dogs have been winning on national stages in the field and in the ring for over a decade.  We have tried almost every form of canine nutrition available. We have done more research than I care to admit, and I have concluded that the Diamond Naturals Brand of Dog (and Cat) Food is the best value in the market today.  This company does not sponsor us, or anyone else. They don't have a breeder program or advertise like all the other brands do, they just make great food and keep the cost as low as they can.<br />I feed almost the entire line of Products offered by this Brand <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFKDT6">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Puppy, Large Breed Lamb and Rice Formula, 40 Pound Bag</a> , <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OCQ6DY">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Dogs, Chicken and Rice Formula, 40 Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFIWXU">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Senior Dogs 8+, Chicken and Rice Formula, 35 Pound Bag</a>.  This food will keep your Dog fit and trim, healthy and keep their coat looking as it should. I highly recommend it.<br />If you're reading this, then you obviously care about your Dog.  Buy this food, follow the recommended feeding instructions and enjoy your best friend for a long long time. God Bless

review/text: We have a lot of fosters coming in and out of our home. As much as I would like to feed them what I give my dogs, it's just not in our budget. After much research and going to dogfoodadvisor.com we found this to be a good dog food without all the junk but for far less than other brands of comparable ingredients. We can actually get this 40lbs bag for about 26.00 at a pet food store about 40 minutes away. So, if we're in a pinch, I do order on line. A lot of fosters come in completely neglected and starved, the amount of food we go through can be mind boggling..lol, thanks diamond Naturals, not regular Diamond!

review/summary: Great Dog Food
review/text: I would continue to purchase this dog food from Amazon.com, but their prices have gone through the roof on this product. The product is fantastic. I actually did 2-3 hours of research on dog food on the internet before changing to this brand of dog food. I wanted to make sure my pups were getting the best without breaking the bank; and I felt I could beat the prices of the garbage bag chow in the grocery stores. Unless you want to sink your paycheck into a good brand like Blue Buffalo, then you may find that you are pleasantly surprised (maybe at other web sites) with the cost and the good value of Diamond Chicken & Rice as well as Diamond Beef & Rice. You can find the Diamond Beef and Rice at MrChewy.com website for a decent price, but the chicken and rice version is still high. All of my dogs tolerate both versions very well, even my rottie that has an overly sensitive stomach.

review/summary: great price, great food
review/text: I ordered this for my 2 girls after doing a little research. It's healthy, WITHOUT THE "HEALTH FOOD" price! They have been more active since eating it. And they went from "starving" with eating 3+ cups a day, to only 2 cups/day. And no more begging! That's my favorite part. They love it, and behave better at meal times. They used to jump all over me, and now they sit patiently and wait for their commands. Okay, okay, part of that is training, sure. But not entirely. It's just good food  :)<br /><br />And of course, it helped cut done on bathroom times and clean-up, bonus!

I have also noticed they do not have such a strong smell anymore, and to me that is a sign of a healthy dog.  The dogs have tons of energy and are looking lean and healthy.  I wish I had done more research and had them on Diamond brand since we brought them home!

review/summary: SKY high price even after RECALL
review/text: I too did my research before buying this product for my dogs.  I was a little nervous about buying a Diamond product after their prior toxic mold recall, but I thought that this company would be the most diligent after an event like that.  The dogs like it, I liked the price, the free shipping was good too.  But, the PRICE has crept up $12 on Amazon in 3 months!  And, now the company is in the midst of yet another recall.  I was going to start looking around again for something new due to the price hike, but now I definitely will due to the recall.  I have lost faith in this company.  I may try something local like Blue Seal feeds as they've never had a recall.  In trying to find an optimum food for my dogs, I'll probably end up killing them with kindness with these recalls.  I think I'm ready to give a locally produced feed that's been around forever a try.

review/text: My dog suffers from extreme shedding so I decided to try a different food for her. I liked the ingredients in Diamond Naturals and just started transitioning her food change so its too soon to say if it will help but I probably will not reorder since the price went up twice for more than $6.00 higher in the last week. Part of my choice was based on the original price of this food and now its priced around the same as other foods just as good if not better so I will keep looking. Disappointed because of this reason.

review/summary: Good until the outbreak of recalls; my poor dogs got a bad batch
review/text: When I put my dogs on the new diet, it took about 4-5 weeks for their stomachs to adjust because they were getting extremely bad farts. After that, they were fine and healthy on it with shiny coats.<br /><br />HOWEVER, upon receiving my third Diamond Naturals Chicken & Rice, they developed awful diarrhea and stomach problems (April 15ish). A couple days later, I found out the Lamb & Rice formula was recalled, but I suspected something was wrong with the Chicken & Rice. Amazon refunded me, and I insisted they should talk to Diamond Naturals and put a warning on their site. I called Diamond Naturals and they said our dogs probably received a bad batch unrelated to the Lamb & Rice and they would be happy to pay for our next bag. We didn't want to risk it and decided to make our own food.<br /><br />Now the cat is out of the bag, and Diamond is recalling ALL SKU's (as of May 4, 2012, today), including several other brands they distribute. Humans have become infected with salmonella from handling the dog food. This is absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. I am hoping that after this event, there will be more regulations for dog food so that we know our pets can have healthy, affordable food. For now I'm not trusting any dog food brand (that I can afford) and will have my dogs on a raw diet.<br /><br />SOURCES:<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: RECALL
review/text: This is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.I too love Grain Free dog food and love that the first ingredient is actually the real meat.<br />My baby girl loves "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison mainly.<br />I searched relentlessly for a reasonable priced food that has no by-products, dyes and are grain free. Which my lil' white Maltese needed for her allergies and tear stains.<br />But, now Diamond Dog Food has been RECALLED for "Salmonella"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled too.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying.

review/text: You can buy chicken in 10# bags for 5 to 7$ tops.  So thats about 32$ for 40 pounds of REAL meat. Boil it or bake it and now your dog has REAL food when you have some time to defrost it and give it to him.<br /><br />Bones?  Chickens are like rubber now, and so are their bones. I have have had 100 years worth of dogs eat chicken bones and never have had a issue. I eat the bones too, so I know well..<br /><br />Give them a good dog food, but look for the meat bargains at the big markets and your dog will live 14 to 20 years like my German Shepherds have.

review/summary: Cool beans
review/text: In baked beans, I'm used to home made baked beans, in a recipe at least four generations old in my family, that are delicious. Anything short of that is just a quick fix substitute, including most of the Bush's flavors.<br /><br />These are different in that they don't taste close enough to our own "secret family recipe" to remind me of it while falling annoyingly short of it. They are not sweet and brown sugary, but they are good. They're also not too bad in terms of calories for a side dish. The listed half cup serving is 110 calories, which is much better with a sandwich than a less filling and completely nutritionless 150 calories for eleven potato chips. In truth, with a sandwich you're fine with a smaller serving than that. A third cup keeps you under 100 calories and gives you a few good spoonfuls along with a hot dog or sandwich.

I eat these with skim milk so I hope my cholesterol level can come down soon.<br /><br />My complain is these are packed into a large box and some of the cups at the bottom were crushed from the weight and probably rough handling during shipment.  Out of the box, two cups were completely gone and one cup had the thin cover open so I wasn't sure if the food quality was still acceptable so I had to throw it away.

The net weight of a bowl of plain Special K is 1.5 oz, whereas the other cereals weigh in at around 2.5 oz.  Special K is also the cheapest cereal to make of the four, making it extremely suspicious that many shipments of this "assortment" seem to be unbalanced in its favor.<br /><br />I'm pretty upset that I purchased a "4-cereal assortment" that ended up containing only 3, and an undesirable mix of those.  Be warned; based on the reviews here, you're likely to have a similar experience.

review/summary: Still a great "Adult" selection of cereals, but
review/text: I first reviewed this product last year (now 2008, but showing original date for some reason). I used them for traveling, eating on the go, and for portion control. Great! Amazon has since raised the price by more than $5 and it is cheaper for me to buy them at the grocery store individually. Also, they took out the Kashi. There is too many regular Special K containers. The Smart Starts, which I do eat, are similar so it doesnt feel like an "assortment" any more.

review/summary: Scam
review/text: In the listing it lists four types of Special K Cereal. But when you receive the order you get alot of different Kellogg's cereals. Like Mini Wheats, Granola with Raisins, Go Lean Crunch, these are not listed, only the Special K is listed. So if you want a varity than this is for you. But I wanted just the Special K and Smart Start as listed. So I feel I was Scammed with a misleading add.

review/text: I've read the reviews and I should have probably listened. When I received my product I noticed right away that some were opened as the cereal was filling on the sides of the box. They were orderly cramped in, but the lids on 18 of those were half-way opened. After checking to see what and how many of each, I counted 12 Raisins w/ Granola, 11 Smartstarts Original, 11 Special K Fruit & Yogurt, 14 Special K Red berries, and 8 Special K Original cereal which in grand total added to 56 cups, NOT the 60 as advertised. I probably won't order this again unless Kellogg's can get their act together when distributing through Amazon.<br /><br />3 stars as the cereal does taste great, especially the Red berries

review/summary: Good value, easy to use, nice selection
review/text: The product is a bit expensive, however, for the convinience it's worth it.  Never need to get a creal bowl again, good portion for guys / grown ups.  It's a bit too much for my wife to finish in 1 shot, it's actually perfectly fine for 2 breakfeasts, so it works out.  Luckily I have 2 nephews, so 1 cup is perfect portion for them as well.<br /><br />Personally, I like the convinience of pouring milk right in it, no need a bowl.  Good for someone who eats breakfeast at work.  Deducted a 1/2 star because it could have been a bit more variety, on my 2nd case now, getting a bit bored of the taste.  Deducted another 1/2 star because the cups really could have been made of paper instead of plastic for environment sake.  I try to find uses for the plastic cups, but after 1 case of these, there's really nothing more I can use the cups for.

I bought these when they were running on the extra specials and it is great, I just pop one in my lunch bag, buy either milk or yogurt at work and i have breakfast.<br />Because of the sale, the price was right, the product is awesome.<br />Could not ask for more.

Great to keep at the office if you need a quick lunch that's not loaded with calories.  The selection is also the healthier versions of cereals on the market.  Delivery was quick and the package arrived undamaged.  If the price is right, we'd definitely buy these again.

review/text: This is a great tea.  It helps with cardiovascular health and is also calming. No sweetener is needed since it has Stevia in it.<br /><br />I started drinking Hawthorn teas for my heart; specifically palpitations. Also, I am under a lot of stress right now because my 85-yr old father has recently been diagnosed with Dementia and he was sent to a skilled nursing facility from the local hospital after falling and breaking 5 ribs.  I am the oldest (and also disabled), and this was all left to me to deal with. My stress level has been extremely high, I have been having anxiety & panic attacks which include palpitations and a very unsettling,uneasy feeling. I had some Xanax that my Dr. had previously prescribed, but I ran out of it. Quite by accident, I found that this particular tea had a very calming effect. It is also really good tasting.  Bija teas carries another Hawthorn tea called Heart Health, but I have not tried it. When reordering I had to be careful to get this exact same one. Also, when looking it up online, most of the time it went to that other Bija Hawthorn Heart Health tea.

If you don't know much about ghee then you probably won't be missing anything, but it's better to buy a good quality product when it comes to food items. Try Taaza by Meghana Foods, Purity Farms, or Liquid Gold instead.
