review/text: I wasn't sold on this idea, having bought bottles of this dressing in Kauai, but this mix turns out great.  Tip- make it in advance.  It's too runny immediately after mixing, but if you put it in the fridge for a little bit it thickens up exactly like the bottled stuff.

review/summary: Love this dressing!!!!
review/text: I picked up a package of this dressing in Maui last October.  I had never tried it before. I just got around to making it.  I got the dry mix and followed the directions.  This is absolutely fabulous.  Now I want more.  I would never purchase it at the price of $7.95 per pack. That is crazy. You can purchase it online at Hilo Hatties or the ABC store for around $2.39 per pack or $7.95 for a pack of 3.  Now this is reasonable. There are also other places that carry it.  The problem is the shipping.  It is so rediculously high. Around $14 to $17 dollars for 9.  Does anyone know if anyone carries it in California?<br /><br />Hilo Hatties reduced my shipping to only $6.50 instead of the $14 originally quoted.

review/summary: Delicious but too expensive!!!
review/text: Papaya Seed Dressing is absolutely delicious but the price is outrageous! I bought a packet in Hawaii for $2.95 at an ABC store(known for tourist pricing) and could not resist buying it on Amazon. With a price of $6.93 and a shipping weight of 1lb. I though that the box would contain 2 or 3 packets of dressing mix. I was very surprised to open the box and find 1 packet. As a Prime member I didn't have to pay any additional shipping charges instead I only had to pay a $4 premium to get this dressing -- never again!

As I did not know it was broken so the fish source was dropping around on my carpet upon my kitchen. This packing was so out of my imagination. It was over sized box without a proper cushioning. So the cans and glass bottles in conjunction to empty space composed a perfect rattling. My lesson to learn here was that I shall never combine the glass bottle and can in one order.

review/text: I own 6 of these and they perform flawlessly. Plenty of shocking power and perfect for protecting your precious garden from marauding critters looking for a meal. There are a lot of cheaper fence chargers/energizers on the market; don't waste your money on ones that short out when one blade of grass lands on it! You pay for what you get.<br /><br />If you need one with plenty of punch that delivers a good jolt, the SS-1000X does just that. My pet goat and sheep respect my electric fences when I have one of these operating them, too.<br /><br />Key features: low impedance, solid-state, imtermittent current and a joule rating of 1 or higher.

review/text: The force will definitely be with you, if you install one of these chargers.  This fence charger is perfect for keeping predators out, and strong enough to pack a punch, for those enclosed by it.  After one or two times of testing it, my rough and rowdy bulldogs want no part of this system.  We've had this charger now for several months and it works like a charm.  Also, like the other poster says, this unit is what the old-timers used to call weed/grass burners.  It is not susceptible to shorting out, like other weaker units are, when it comes to taller grass or weeds.  The heavy duty definitely applies here.  If you are looking for a good, strong fence charger, look no further.  I would give it 6 stars if I could!

The results were pretty sensational.  I've tried this paprika in many other dishes since then, including a Sunny Anderson Mac-N-Cheese.  Everywhere it goes, this paprika clearly outclasses it's rivals.  This paprika has some real punch.<br /><br />I have a big kilogram jar of inferior paprika from an small mom & pop shop around the corner.  I don't know what I am going to do with that stuff now.  It is flavorless and lifeless compared to the real thing.  Don't waste your life with the inferior stuff.  Buy this instead.

review/summary: Delicious, smoky, subtle, not too hot
review/text: As the description says, don't be put off by the word "hot" in the name.  It has a kick, but it's a lot less hot than cayenne.  I dipped a finger tip into it and put it on my tongue, felt a little heat rise slowly, then fade away slowly, leaving a nice sweet, rich smokiness on my palette that lingered for 10 more minutes or so, long after any trace of spiciness was gone.<br />The smoke flavor is fantastic- sweet, mild, pervasive.  Just a small pinch in whatever you use it for is plenty for a subtle smokiness and a little kick, or you can use more if you really want smoke.  Mix it into a spice rub, sprinkle it on any kind of food before you cook it, add a pinch to a salad dressing, make your own BBQ sauce or hot sauce, add it to eggs, use it in goulash, whatever.  With few exceptions, I like to add just a little of any given dried spice to foods such that it adds complexity, if you search really hard you might pick it out, but unless you try or someone tells you, you wouldn't know it's there.  This is a great product for that purpose, if used very sparingly.  This is a very high quality spice, worth the money.  It was produced by artisans, not hacks.

review/text: Hot Smoked Paprika from La Chinata is delicious. It gives chicken, fish, eggs, vegetables like broccoli, spinach, caulifower, etc.a smoky taste that is moderately hot, (hardly for me) not overpowering the flavors of the foods and the other spices. I discovered it at a home of a cousin who let me cook in her kitchen. She did not tell me anything about it. I tried it first with chicken that was lightly fried and cooked maily with salt and pepper. it enriched greatly the flavor of the chicken and everybody in my family loved it and asked what I had used.

review/summary: I love this stuff!
review/text: OK, let me start out by saying that chocolate is always in my house and office. I always have milk chocolate and dark chocolate, sometimes white chocolate. I bought this because I have tried a bunch of the Lindt flavors and sent them to my pen pal overseas. Yes, people in this day and age still have pen pals! I was explaining in one of my letters that our grocery store has a span of 5 to 6 Lindt bars in various flavors at all times. She asked me what I was talking about because chocolate comes in milk and dark where she lives. So... I bought up what my grocery store had then sent it off to Northern Europe. My pen pal's family loved trying the various flavors.<br /><br />So... when my local grocery store ran out of "new" flavors to send I came to Amazon for help. I put this in my cart, along with every other unusual chocolate flavor I could find (from Lindt and others). When each box of 12 arrived I shared a few bars with the office staff and sent a few bars to my pen pal. This box of chocolate bars DISAPPEARED right before my eyes! I think I sent 3 bars to Europe and the remaining bars were devoured at work. Any buyer of chocolate for an office crew KNOWS when the chocolate is way above par because the pleading eyes come from every corner of the building to grovel for more chocolate.<br /><br />I would buy this again, and again, and again. The box has 12 bars so it should last a few days depending on how many mouths there are to feed. I would certainly stock up in April or May for the warmer summer months (unless you live in the extreme south of the USA, then I would order in the coolest months and stock pile for all the rest of the year).<br /><br />This is a smooth, creamy chocolate. The aroma is fantastic and certainly reminiscent of chocolate. It has a subtle creamy, milk flavor without feeling or tasting burned. The bar is sufficiently sweet without being cloying. The vanilla aroma is pure and delicate but noticeable. If anyone likes white chocolate I think they will LOVE this particular white chocolate.

They have an awesome flavor that really adds to your plate and yet it doesn't have that bitter edge to it.  That being said, I've ordered green peppercorns from a couple of different spice companies and you can't beat the price of these!  They have excellent value and quality, and I can't recommend them more!<br /><br />Green peppercorns are especially good on fish, eggs, pasta and other light-bodied foods.  I will NEVER go back to black peppercorns again!

review/text: I have only one complaint, I would have ordered 10 lbs if they sold them in 10 lb bags that is...  Ok, time to be serious, this is exactly what I wanted and they arrived the same week I ordered them.  I highly recommend to you green peppercorn fans.  Now I just need to perfect my green peppercorn steak sauce...  (any advice will be greatly appreciated.)

review/text: These peppers have good color, aroma, and taste. I ordered a pound and am quite pleased with the amount of product per dollar. We use green peppers for many things: poaching salmon, flavoring corned beef, ground in salads, etc. So far I've found the peppers competitive with any other green peppers I've bought and they are less expensive to boot.

review/text: This is the best ever of making a great Chicken Ceasar Salad!  We have always found the bottled creamy dressings too thick and not tart ... I marinate chicken breats all day in the dressing, then grill them ... slice and top a tossed salad of romaine, shredded parm cheese and bacon ( we use bacon bits ) add coutons if you like them and you have a GREAT meal!  If the dressing for the salad is too tart or not creamy enuf for you, you can mix with a creamy variety of Ceasar dressing, we use Marie's.<br /><br />I am SO VERY EXCITED to have found this on amazon.com as it can't be found anywhere here in North Florida!  And at such a GREAT price!  Yea!!!!  :)

review/text: I had read the reviews and so I ordered the Good Seasons Caesar Dressing.  I was really disappointed that it didn't taste at all like Caesar dressing.  I do remember reading that one person said that he/she didn't think it tasted like Caesar, but with all the good reviews, I took a chance.  I am just as disappinted in all bottled "Caesar" dressings as well as in the many recipe's I've tried.  Wish this had been "the" dressing, but sadly, it wasn't.

review/text: I've used this powdered dressing mix both as a salad dressing and a marinade for chicken. One of the things I like about it is that you don't need to use nearly as much oil for the marinade as is called for on the package directions.  I marinate boneless, skinless chicken so I can grill it.  The chicken stays moist and tender and has a great flavor.  I highly recommend this dressing.

I combine the two packages with just enough white vinegar (about 1/4 cup) to make a thinnish paste and marinate either beef or chicken with it. Then I bake, bbq or broil the meat.<br />I can't find any store anymore that carries it. I found it on Amazon.com and placed an order that came FAST. Hopefully they wont' run out.

review/text: Our little dog had really bad skin allergies and was on California Naturals for quite a while with no relief. We decided to switch her to the Innova and a week later she is not scratching anymore and her hair is growing back. Hopefully this is the last time we will be switching dog foods because she had a very sensitive stomache as well. Im not saying this will cure your dogs, but it had worked for us. It might seem a little expensive but all in all it will last you longer so its really not very much more in the long run and is nutritionally better for them than store brands. We are so glad we decided to give Innova a chance and she is too!

We fed her this for about two weeks until I found Innova's Low Fat formula and she's been fine since.<br /><br />Innova's Evo has extremely high amount of fat in it which my oldest can't take so I didn't want my second oldest to also start developing pancreatitis as well so I switched her to the next best thing in my book which is from the same exact company but with a formula which has grains in it.  I agree that dogs do not need grains however the formula helps to lower the amount of fat and protein which some dogs need.<br /><br />I have had no problems on this formula and my second oldest (the one who is on this) has never turned her nose up to it.<br /><br />I trust Innova, they are an independent dog food company which has their own manufacturing plant unlike hundreds of other dog food brands which produce their products in the same plant along side other brands. Some which maybe use the same exact recipe and call it different things or even the same source of ingredients.<br /><br />Innova also has won quality certifications from companies I've heard of before this shows me they really do care for their product.

review/summary: Glad we switched to Innova
review/text: I fed Nutro Lamb & Rice to my Min Pin for about 8 months because it was on the recommended list at the county shelter. Recently someone suggested that I stop feeding it to her, and I learned about recommendations at a DogFoodAnalysis site.<br /><br />While eating Nutro, my dog's pee was entirely clear and her poop was hard as a rock (she actually looked uncomfortable).<br /><br />Based on recommendations, I switched to Innova Adult Small Bites. Within a day, my dog's pee was appropriately yellow again and withn two days her poo was normal (not rock hard, with less straining). I don't know if there's a link, but I'm glad we switched.<br /><br />This is top quality food.

review/summary: It's worth the extra cost
review/text: Our dog is now 13.5 years old.  In the past few years she had become slightly lethargic and her face has started to show her age (I can relate to that). I decided to start taking better care of her by giving her better food. She loves the Innova dry food and has been eating it for 4 months. Plus, the changeover did not upset her digestive tract. Perhaps my wife and I are experiencing the placebo effect in regards to the new dog food. But, our dog now looks and acts like she is 10 years old as opposed to 13.5.  Maybe I'll try some Innova myself (just kidding!).  If you don't mind spending a little more on your dog's food, plus the cost of shipping, I highly recommend Innova.  I just wish that the local stores carried it so that I wouldn't need to pay postage.<br /><br />Update:  As of mid-2011, "PetsMart" now carries Innova products in their stores.

review/summary: Love this tea!  Tastes as good as homemade
review/text: I have been plagued with viruses & sore throats & sinus infections a lot this year. I'm not a big fan of hot drinks, but hot tea really does help soothe sore throats and helps sinuses drain, too.<br /><br />My favorite hot tea when I'm sick has been homemade Ginger-Lemon tea--heat the water, chop the ginger & lemon, put all in a teapot & let sit for 10 minutes and then add honey or sweetener.  It's great.  It tastes (and smells) yummy.  I would make it in big batches & put in the fridge to microwave by the cup.<br /><br />This Twinings Revive Herbal Lemon and Ginger tea brings the workload down to a simple heat water, steep tea bag, add sweetener. No chopping, no clean up.  No going to the grocery if you're out of lemon or ginger.<br /><br />When you are sick, faster and easier is way better.  This fits the bill nicely, thank you.  The taste is exactly the same as my homemade, too, and I was really surprised by that.  I was expecting it to be weak or either too lemony or too much ginger, but it's not.  It's very tasty.<br /><br />It's also caffeine free, of course, which is a good thing overall, but especially when you are sick and need to rest.<br /><br />There is a little overkill on the packaging.  The box is cello-wrapped, and each tea bag is individuall wrapped, too.  I don't know that it's necessary to do all that, but I'm sure it extends the shelf life considerably, and nobody wants "old, dried out" tea.  I think Celestial Seasonings has a waxed paper solution that seems to work and seems a bit more "green", but they didn't have this flavor.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: A Strong & Spicy Matcha
review/text: This definitely nails the flavor of a strong Gingerbread cookie! Lots of ginger of course, along with cinnamon and a touch of rich molasses. It's very spicy, much like a gingersnap, and makes a great latte--especially with a pinch of brown sugar, which really enhances the hints of cookie flavor. This is a great holiday treat, especially when combined with Red Leaf's Eggnog matcha!

review/summary: Yummy Gingerbread!
review/text: I didn't eat a lot of gingerbread as a kid.  When I was growing up, gingerbread wasn't a huge tradition ... to me, gingerbread was nothing more than part of a story about a cookie that came to life and got the whole town running after it.<br /><br />But I did eat gingersnaps.  And I loved them!  And since my childhood, I've tried a few different gingerbreads - some were cookie-ish, some were more cake-y or bread-y than cookie ... but I've only tasted a very few that I would say tasted as good as the sharp, peppery snap of a gingersnap.  That warm, sassy spice of a gingersnap - that's what I like!<br /><br />And that's what I taste with this Gingerbread Matcha from Red Leaf Tea.  It is warm and spicy, but not in a hot spicy kind of way.  More of a warm, exotic spicy taste.  And while I did not taste a lot of "bready" or "cake-y" or "cookie" kind of notes to the Matcha when it is prepared traditionally with water, after preparing it traditionally and taking a few sips, and deciding it needed something more, I added just a splash of milk to it, and that did the trick!  Now I have a gingerbread Matcha latte that is absolutely ah-mazing!  I love it!

review/summary: Great holiday tea!
review/text: Ah gingerbread. Is there anything more comforting than a chewy ginger cookie around the holidays? Well yes, probably (haha realism!) but that is definitely one of my favourite things! My simple pleasure. One of my other simple pleasures is a perfectly golden brown grilled cheese! Hmm all of my simple pleasures soon to revolve around food... I digress!<br /><br />Simple pleasures in matcha form! Way quicker than to bake a cookies, cheaper than buying a batch, and I can drink it! YES! I am very pleased with this matcha. : )<br /><br />The first time I tried it was shaken in a waterbottle! This was not the way to go haha. It tasted like ginger water - definitely tasted like it was good for me! Just not too palatable.<br /><br />Whisking it up hot with a pinch of brown sugar is *definitely* the way to go! Holy moley that's good! Sweet and gingery (VERYgingery) with the depth of molasses. I tamed the ginger with a splash of cream and was more than happy with the result.

review/text: If you like gingerbread but not all the sugary sweetness of it - this is the matcha for you. This has all the spices you would find in ginger bread - or ginger snap cookies without the sugar attack.<br /><br />For me its not sweet enough so I have to add a little something but it is good enough I could get away without adding it.<br />There is a slight bakey flavor in this tea but its mostly ginger, and an all spice blend sort of spice note in it.

review/summary: Braaaaaiins....
review/text: This tea gave me the best idea ever: Zombie Gingerbread Men. Every year for Christmas, I make cookies for my wife and sister-in-law to decorate and they are insane with it. In the past years we've ended up with Ed Wood, an Orion slave girl in a Star Trek uniform, a Purple People Eater, and many, many other cracked decorations. These two really shouldn't be trusted with pastry bags. But yes, this year I am definitely making sugar cookies with gingerbread matcha and letting them go at it. I should get some of those gingerbread men cookie cutters that look like they already have a bite taken out of it. I need to do a trial run to be sure they taste alright, maybe for Hallowe'en.<br /><br />Anyway, yes, on to the matcha. Well, one thing is for sure, it is definitely GINGER bread. The ginger is very, very strong, but I'm not entirely sure that's a bad thing. Maybe a touch of brown sugar will help round out the edges, because right now I can't really taste anything but ginger. I tried it witht he brown sugar and while it did bring out the molasses goodness of gingerbread, it's still a bit too gingery for me. But the taste that remains on my tongue is amazing...maybe I'll get used to that bite of ginger over time.

review/summary: This stuff is the crack of salad dressings.
review/text: Seriously, this stuff is addictive.  My family argues when it runs out, the same way we would over who finished the last of the milk.  The flavor is hard to descibe but it inspires a certain fanaticism in most people and I've never heard anybody who wasn't impressed after trying it.  The Sesame and Miso has a stronger, spicier flavor, but this is light and really improves mild lettuces like iceberg.  Another advantage is that a little goes a long way.  It isn't the healthiest (but what dressing is?), as it's high in salt and has about 7.5 grams of fat per tablespoon.  On the other hand, it is cholesterol free and has no preservatives added.  I figure, since I enjoy salads now and wouldn't touch them before, that it's a good trade off.  And, really, it tastes amazing.

review/text: I found the Pietro dressing at a food show years ago and was so annoyed that I couldn't find it in stores. Now, thanks to Amazon it's available on line delivered to my door! Here's how I first got hooked. The demonstrator had a bowl of lettuce. He put two pieces of the cut up lettuce in a small cup and then added TWO DROPS of this dressing on top. I tasted it and it was HEAVEN! It has a VERY high fat content but that's not BAD. The secret is to use just a LITTLE. Don't just "pour it on". The flavor is so intense that you will taste it immediately. This is my favorite flavor of the 4 they offer. Miso & Ginger come next. Even the Pickled Plum is interesting.<br /><br />The company ships fast and has A-1 Customer Service. With the convenience of ordering on line, you don't need to search. Thank God for the internet.<br /><br />Steve

review/summary: The best salad dressing ever!
review/text: Wow, I whole-heartedly agree with the two other reviewers.  I tried this dressing for the first time only a couple of days ago, in New York.  I have to say that I'm not big on American-style salads (i.e. and in general, a ton of lettuce with a bit of carrot and tomato, plus croutons and cheese) and am indifferent to most salad dressings (Ranch, Italian, French).  But when I tried this dressing on a rather average salad, I was so blown away that I had to stop the conversation at our table after the very first bite in order to ask what the dressing was.<br /><br />I am from Texas, so I was a little disappointed to hear that the dressing was purchased in New Jersey and that the person who had it has never seen it in New York City.  I was about to purchase the dressing online when I saw on their website that it appears they carry these dressings at Fiestas!  I'm really excited about that and hope it's really so, it's going to be the first thing I do when I return - run to a Fiesta and purchase that dressing.  I also should mention that the title might be a little misleading: I am not particularly fond of soy sauce myself, but I think that there is so much more than just soy going on in that dressing, that I'd recommend you give it a try even if you generally don't like soy.<br /><br />I'm never using another dressing in my home!

review/summary: Too heavy on the onions and garlic, but tasty otherwise
review/text: I'll admit it: I'm a freak. I don't like onions or garlic. Shoot me.<br /><br />Other than the evil alliums in this dressing, though, it's like serious salad dressing crack. There's something sweet and salty and vinegary about this dressing that combine in perfect harmony to make a really awesome dressing.<br /><br />Strangely, I like it OK in salads, but I like it even better on a sandwich. Ever get oil and vinegar on your sandwich? It's like that, only better. There's gotta be MSG in this stuff, because - wow, it's addictive.<br /><br />The onions and garlic definitely cheapen the flavor to me, so it only gets four stars, but if you like dried or granulated onions and garlic, you'll dig this dressing. Also good to dip soybeans in.

review/text: We are so glad to be able to order Angelo Pietro salad dressings from Amazon.  We used to be able to buy them in Atlanta but the specialty food store that carried Angelo Pietro dressings closed and we have had a hard time finding them since.  As other reviewers have said, a little bit goes a long way so don't worry about the fat content.  It is delicious on salads or on sliced vegetables like home grown tomatoes or cucumbers.  The ginger dressing is just as delicious and is very low in fat.  Once you try Angelo Pietro dressings, you won't go back to your old salad dressings.  We highly recommend both the Shoyu Soy Sauce dressing and the Ginger dressing.

They have a nice grapefruity taste without being overly sour. They do however tend to get kind of hard if sitting around for awhile, so I was pleased that the bag I got from Amazon was very fresh and all the candy still nice and soft. 5 pounds though is a lot of candy!

The flavor has a wonderful, natural bite to it that is about as far from artificial as you can get. The thickness and sour sugar distribution all harmonize in what I find is the best candy PERIOD. I love to throw a bag of these on gift orders for friends or family to ensure I get free shipping and to blow their minds with 5 pounds of pure indulgent heaven.<br /><br />If you are hesitant to buy such a large bag of only one flavor don't be shy. You will wish you had bought two. If you really must insist on variety go for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVQWK2">Haribo Gummi Candy, Fruit Salad, 5-Pound Bag</a> but I promise you the white grapefruits will be the first to go.
