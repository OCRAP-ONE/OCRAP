review/text: What is wrong with the quality control???  My last 6pk of peppermint altoids had about 40% wintergreen intermingled.  DISGUSTING!!! There's nothing like expecting peppermint and getting nothing close to it. It's like expecting beer and getting unsweetened tea.  Please do something about your QC!

review/summary: way cheaper than local retail; not as good as COSTCO
review/text: For myself, COSTCO is way cheaper, but this came with free shipping and so was cheaper as a gift to be sent than purchasing at COSTCO then packaging to wrap and postage/shipping costs. Still: the cost from this supplier is significan;y better than purchasing where no COSTCO is available, such as local pharmacy/grocery--and you know friends and family who like this product will like the quantity because the product is one that he/she never wants to be without, so there's always the want for a tin in the car, in a pocket or purse, etc.

review/text: There really is no better mint.  Don't get fooled, though... the other ones are not all that great and C&B kind of "sell out" sometimes and use artificial flavoring and the like.  However, the plain old Peppermint ones are just awesome... and the tins are super handy for keeping all manner of tidbits.  To my wife's horror, I even take and tape hooks on the back of them and hang them on the Christmas tree.  Look at that... great mints, and the cases double as wonderous ornaments.  What a deal!

review/summary: "Curious" mints indeed...
review/text: Ingredients: Sugar, Gum Arabic, Natural Flavor (Oil of Peppermint), Gelatin<br /><br />I was a fan of Altoids mints until I started researching ingredients and found out how gelatin is made. It's not surprising that the tin doesn't advertise, "Contains boiled animal skin, tendons & bones," since most people would not consider these desirable. You don't have to be a vegetarian to have an objection to congealed animal scraps in your breath mints. Altoids may be 100% natural, but they are not made with 100% quality ingredients.  I suggest trying VerMints, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVT18">VerMints All Natural PepperMints, 1.41-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>, instead.  They are animal by-product free & taste delicious. And if you're looking for sugar-free mints try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FIWIWA">Emerald Forest Ricochet Sugar Free Mints with Xylitol, Peppermint, 100-Count Tins (Pack of 6)</a>. They are sweetened with xylitol, a natural alternative sweetener, so they don't promote cavities like sugar does. Both of these products come in convenient tins like Altoids and are made with all natural, more appetizing ingredients.

I don't know if it was on the shelf too long (as with alot of products in these boutiquey low volume markets), but it was soooo not even close to sweet, just pure tart vinegar.  It went straight into the trash.  I didn't see any expiration date jumping out at me.  Would have been nice to see one prominently so I could have been warned.

review/text: Brownie says she likes this food and Big Red is willing to eat it but prefers canned. What does my opinion matter if the cats say YES. However, I do have an opinion on the dry companion product, Filet Mignon Flavor With Real Seafood and Shrimp. The cats really liked that flavor but I won't buy it because it has a food coloring(?) in it which turns the carpet pink when Brownie upchucks on the carpet. If you have a regularly upchucking cat you might want to choose this flavor and avoid the Filet Mignon flavor.

review/summary: Oh my goodness, this tea...
review/text: Cranberry. Cranberry is another one of those flavors that brings out very distinct memories for me. Thanksgiving at my grandmother's house, not for the cranberry sauce (which I loathe), but for the cranberry juice she always had on hand. I loved it! And she'd mix it with a bit of ginger ale for me and oh, I felt so grown up...my first cocktail! Virgin, of course. We lost her the year I started college, so every time I taste anything with cranberry, I think of her. Then growing up, my mom taught me how to make this delicious cranberry-orange bread with fresh cranberries, and that bread is why I always have cranberries in my freezer. I made it for my in-laws the first Christmas after the wedding and now they look forward to it every year. Maybe after I've tried this straight I'll need to try it with some orange juice. But cranberry is a flavor very near and dear to my heart, so I am very much looking forward to trying this one. The health benefits of cranberries aren't such a bad thing either, and since I don't drink juice anymore, this might be a good way for me to get them.<br /><br />This blew my socks off. The scent when the package is opened is a sweet cranberry, not the tart berry I was looking for, but I can't bring myself to complain. I put about a quarter of a teaspoon in a small mug, added about 75-80 C water, some sugar, and frothed it up. Then I added robots (by which I mean ice in the shape of robots) and a touch of cold water to make a beautiful iced tea. I am so far from disappointed it hurts. This is lovely. I didn't expect to like this one nearly as much as I do, but I am in love. I'm definitely seeing the berry in cranberry, but there's also a hint of tartness in the middle of the sip. I am so surprised, I honestly didn't expect to be wowed by this. But I am and I am going to restock on it ASAP. I can't wait to try it blended with some vanilla matcha or some orange juice...yum. I don't have a lot of experience with cranberry outside of the little fruits baked into muffins, but I think I need to branch out and try some new things!

review/summary: Great convenience, but stuck with quality for entire shipmant
review/text: I eat sunflower seeds almost every day, and David's is my favorite brand.  Just finding the large bags in the stores can be difficult, and the price has been creeping upwards for the past year, so I am getting a great deal and wonderful convenience in buying bulk via Amazon.  The only problem is that the quality of the seeds varies naturally, and in getting a dozen bags at a time, one gets the same quality in that entire shipment.  My first shipment were all large, tasty seeds, which was great.  My second shipment seems to be all small seeds; still tasty, but not really as good as the larger ones. I guess it's really no worse than buying five bags at a time at the store, and then hoping for the same or better quality the next time.  The savings are significant, and if I can finish a shipment before the next one is due, I'll definitely stick with it.

review/text: I was raised up on these animals. As a child I used to go down to the farmers market and buy them by the pound. Now they come conveniently delivered in just the right size package.<br /><br />The neat thing about Sunflower Seeds in the shell is that they are like buying three different products or tastes; you can eat them in the shell, out of the shell. Or just suck on the salty shells after consuming the seed.<br /><br />Opening the shells is a skill in its self. Some people pry it open with their finger nails. Others bite down on it sideways making a cracking sound.<br /><br />Another gross fun thing to do is spit the shells all over the place.<br /><br />Any way you look at it there is lots of fun from this little package.

review/summary: Delicious with wonderful PACKAGING
review/text: I love David sunflower seeds.  They have that genuine sunflower seed taste & smell.  The big bags are a real plus.  After the first bag, I use the empty bag to put the shells in for the second bag of seeds I enjoy.  Then I use the second bag for the shells from the third bag, and so on.  The trouble is what to do with the shells from the first bag?  I thought about it and put the shells from the first bag I enjoyed into a candy jar, to save until I finish enjoying the twelfth bag, which I will then fill with the shells from the first bag, which are now in my candy jar.  The bags are very colorful and air-tight, which can cause mildew if the shells are moist.  So if you are going to save the bags of empty shells I recommend that you split the shells with a tiny nut-cracker (or needle-nose pliers) which is what I have always done after an unfortunate experience some time back with mildew in the bags.  Don't split them in your mouth or they will become moist and then you have to dry them in your oven set to low heat (I don't have an oven!).  If you can't afford a fancy Japanese pillow filled with oat-husks for your posture, the bags of sunflower seed shells make a great substitute.  While I definitely CAN afford the Japanese oat-husk pillows (I'm a PROFESSIONAL person) I think the David bags add a lot of color to my bedroom, plus the waterproof plastic doesn't absorb my night-sweat (avoids more mildew).  My group and I discussed theories about which David these seeds are named for, it would be nice if the company would put a picture of the right David on the bag so we would stop arguing.  Other than that, this is the perfect food, the perfect product.  Put a picture of whoever David is on the bag and I will give you a fifth star!  Thank you so much for bringing these sunflower seeds (and the colorful reusable airtight packages) into my life!

These seeds truly are a "snacktivity" as they say on every bag. Enjoy every last seed in these big, money saving bags!

review/summary: Baseball & David Sunflower Seeds ... Favorite Pastime
review/text: I am of the opinion that this is a very good buy for the "seeder" ... it has worked out to be a considerably better value per ounce than purchasing at the grocery store; particularly if a buyer subscribes for periodic deliveries.  This may not be the case for everyone, but I have also had difficulty finding these bigger bags at local grocery stores / retailers.<br /><br />Eat. Spit. Be Happy!

review/text: I'm a fan of David's original style sunflower seeds. The only place I have found the larger packages near me was the regular grocery (Safeway). These are the same thing, and much fresher tasting than the small packages in the multigallon container that is a different option. When on the subscribe and save program, they even come out cheaper than I could get them for on sale in the grocery market.

review/text: I don't think the packaging is misleading for this at all.  Sunflower seeds are roasted in the shell, not without. If you wanted unshelled seeds, then look for a package that says that.  You are not to eat the seeds with the shell on, so I feel really bad for the earlier reviewer who was having all the trouble.  I wish that the low-sodium version was available for order, so I will only give this 4-stars.

review/text: This product should not be called sunflower seeds, it should have been called sunflower shells.  Yes, there are seeds inside the shells but the package is misleading saying its salted and roasted making it seem like they would be shelled first.  The product should say unshelled somewhere in the information about it.  If you want unshelled seeds using this brand's bizarre lingo you want "kernels"  not seeds, I mean everyone knows to ask for sunflower kernels right?  What was I thinking.  Too bad for the uninitiated

review/summary: Deliciously good for you!
review/text: Working with Eden Grove Organic White Tea Rub with Ceylon Spices for Lamb is a wonderful experience! The tin is attractive and tight sealing keeping your beef rub fresh! It makes lamb delicious!<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Organic White Tea, Lemongrass, Black Pepper, Clove, Dry Lime, Cumin, Rosemary, Salt<br /><br />Tea has been used as medicine for centuries. Now modern science is discovering what people in China and throughout the world have long known: tea is good for you. While green and black tea are very healthy, white tea is the least processed tea and has the highest antioxidant levels. It may be the supreme Drink of Health.<br /><br />Antioxidants are nutrients that protect the body from damage by free radicals. Free radicals are nasty things that go around wreaking havoc on your body, damaging DNA and accelerating aging. Antioxidants scoop them up and neutralize them. White tea is loaded with these protective nutrients.<br /><br />White tea may have profound power against cancer-causing cells and against many different types of cancer, such as colon, prostate, and stomach cancers. Flavonoids, a class of antioxidants, inhibit the growth of cancer cells and prevent the development of new ones. In some cases, white tea has been found to work as well as prescription drugs, but without the side effects.<br /><br />Studies show that white tea can thin the blood and improve artery function. It helps lower high blood pressure and maintain a healthy one. By promoting strong and healthy blood vessels, white tea guards against the ravages of stroke.<br /><br />Catechins, another group of antioxidants, have been found to reduce cholesterol, and white tea is teeming with them. Cholesterol is a special type of fat and is necessary for health. There is good cholesterol and bad cholesterol, and white tea increases the good while decreasing the bad. This helps prevent hardening of the arteries and blockage of blood flow.<br /><br />By thinning the blood, lowering blood pressure, and reducing cholesterol, white tea protects the heart and the entire circulatory system. Researchers have also discovered that people who drink 2 or more cups of tea a day are almost 50% less likely to die after suffering a heart attack. White tea is truly a remarkable heart tonic.<br /><br />Studies have found that people who drank tea regularly had greater bone density and strength than non-drinkers. White tea may also have beneficial effects for sufferers of arthritis and osteoporosis.<br /><br />White tea is a natural killer of bacteria and viruses. The antioxidants so abundant in white tea tone the entire immune system, providing protection against a variety of invaders and a wide range of diseases. Its helps guard against the common cold and flu, and can ease the symptoms of HIV.<br /><br />White tea contains small amounts of fluoride and other nutrients which keeps the teeth strong and healthy. It also kills the bacteria which causes plaque, tooth decay, and bad breath.<br /><br />Free radicals from staying out in the sun too long, stress, and a poor diet can damage the skin and cause it to prematurely age. By scavenging these free radicals, white tea protects the skin and helps to reverse some of the damage. Drinking white tea promotes healthy and radiant skin.<br /><br />White tea has many other benefits to offer. It may reduce blood sugar and help prevent and alleviate the symptoms of diabetes. It reduces stress and increases energy.<br /><br />White tea may or may not aid in weight-loss. Studies suggest tea may increase metabolism and encourage the body to burn more fat, but a balanced diet and regular exercise are more likely to produce results. Still, adding white tea to your weight-loss plan can't hurt.<br /><br />White tea protects against cancer, heart disease, and stroke, the leading causes of death in the industrial world, as well as numerous other conditions. It eases the symptoms of illness and promotes recovery. White tea strengthens the circulatory and immune systems as well as bones and teeth, and builds healthy skin.<br /><br />Lemongrass inhibits candida, alleviates fevers, improves kidney health, and augments GABA.<br /><br />Black pepper aids digestion, relieves gas, and augments Dopamine neurotransmitter.<br /><br />Cloves suppress some forms of bacteria, improves digestion, alleviates pain and augments GABA neurotransmitter.<br /><br />Cumin lowers elevated blood sugar, cholesterol and elevated triglycerides, alleviates intestinal cramps and augments acetylcholine and dopamine neurotransmitters.<br /><br />Rosemary lowers blood pressure, alleviates allergies, reduces inflammation, helps to regulate menstruation, and augments dopamine.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: CaJun or Creole?
review/text: Those who have never experienced life south of I10 in Louisiana for an extennded period, rarely see any difference between the two, CaJun or Creole.  Creoles are and were the upper class in New Orleans.  Their background is upper class French mixed with American Indian and hints of other races.  Cajuns are french refuges from Canada who were forcefully removed from their homes and after multiple harrowing experiences were finally forced, by the British, into Southern Louisiana west of New Orleans.  The cooking styles of the two very different ethnic backgrounds are also definitely different even if they do overlap in some areas.  This product "Louisiana Fish Fry - Cajun Jambalaya Mix" is real Cajun style jambalaya mix.  This is the mix used by many of my Cajun friends and is the only one I've found that tastes like from scratch Cajun jambalaya.<br /><br />For truly Cajun style jambalaya, whatever meat you use with the mix (They use a VERY wide variety of meats.) should augmented with andouille sausage.  We all have our favorite andouille sausage but no general agreement on which is the best. Andouille sausage was brought to Louisiana by German settlers.  It both quite smoky and spicy hot but not too hot.  Hot is Cajun; too hot is for tourists wanting Cajun but not knowing suffering hot is not necessarily or truly Cajun.  The average Cajun dish is hot enough to bring out the pepper's other flavors but not hot enough to cause permanent physical damage to the tongue or other mouth parts.

Last ones I bought in Delaware were about $1.89 each.<br /><br />One pack is 7.5 oz.  I have one sitting in front of me, so I know.  When I find them, I buy several because they are very popular at potluck parties, and even as gifts.  Too bad this Amazon offering at $9.95 is about 5 times the going price!<br /><br />This reflects badly on Amazon.com as a whole.

review/text: I love "hot dogs and beans" but this product isn't so good. The wieners and beans taste much the same like the flavor was leeched from the wieners into the beans. For emergency food a better alternative would be to add Vienna Sausages to pork and beans. The only problem with the Vienna's is they taste bitter when added to the beans but that's easily fixed by adding some brown sugar or honey. My favorite "hot dogs and beans" recipe is to cut-up some real wieners, microwave them for a minute, add pork and beans, brown sugar, catsup, dehydrated onions and a dash of ground ginger then microwave that mixture.

review/summary: One Treat My Dogs Really Love
review/text: I found these quite reasonably priced here at Amazon.  I have two golden retrievers who I spoil and have been buying these treats for a few years.  They like bones and I like the added feature of chicken with them (obviously the dogs like the chicken too).  Last time I bought these I bought a few jars as with two dogs and me giving them one every time they come in, they don't last long.  Thanks Amazon for a good price on these when there was a special.

review/summary: Over Priced
review/text: Great product, my dogs (Collies) both LOVE these snacks.  With that said, I had been buying the Wrapped Biscuits from BJs for $9.99, BJs ran out so I bought them on line for over $25.00 almost 3 times as much so like I said great product but way over priced at Amazon.com

review/summary: Dog Loves them but Cost is Way too high
review/text: My dog loves these treats but I found that this company charges way too much for this item.  I usually get the same size jar for $9.99 at BJ's, they were out of them for a few weeks and I thought they weren't going to get them so I ordered them from here...for 25.00...didn't realize the cost was so much higher, thought it was a bigger jar than I usually get but it wasn't.  Way overpriced in my opinion.

review/summary: Afraid to give to my dogs.
review/text: I ordered these treats as they looked similar to the Waggin Train Chick'n Biscuit. Well, they are nothing like them. My dogs love the product from Waggin Train, but would not eat these. The chemical smell was overpowering. Not sure what they are made of, but they went into the trash can. I hope I don't get fined for dumping toxic waste.

review/summary: Nice flavor without missing salt
review/text: I have tried both the Tony Charchere's Originial and the Tony Chachere's Salt Free Creole Seasoning.  This review is for the latter (salt free). It seasons very well. The ingredients listed are: potassium chloride, maltodextrin, red pepper, garlic, spices and silicon dioxide. There is a disclaimer that advised people with diabetes, heart or kidney disease or to those receiving medical treatment to consult a physician before using the product. The seasoning is not overpowering.  A little goes a long way.  It gives food a nice seasoned flavor, and salt is not missed.  There is no bitter,sweet or artificial aftertaste. The flavoring is not overpowering.

review/summary: Revolting
review/text: I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00161DVFS">Tony Chachere's More Spice Creole Seasoning - 7 oz.</a> and so gave this a try.  It's has a very salt-like taste due to the KCl (potassium chloride) used instead of NaCl (sodium chloride, real table salt).<br /><br />I used it to flavor some Ramen for a test.  The first taste was more or less like regular salt with a tiny dash of mild pepper.  I noticed an odd aftertaste, which I assumed was due to the salt being KCl instead of NaCl.  Unfortunately, the more I ate, the worse the aftertaste became until I felt like I was licking muck dredged from a Louisiana bayou.<br /><br />I'd recommend tasting this before you buy it, if possible.  Definitely try it on food you won't mind perhaps ruining and be wary of serving food up to guests that has been pre-spiced with this.<br /><br />I was going to throw mine out, but on reflection, I decided it would be fun to ask my friends to try it, "OMG, this is awful .. here, tell me what you think!"  ^^<br /><br />--<br /><br />Hotness: extremely mild, almost bland (nb. I consider Tobasco to be mild)<br />Salty: very salty, with an unpleasant aftertaste

review/summary: Good but not as good as others
review/text: I am a huge spicy food fan!  I put hot sauce on just about everything and have tried probably a hundred different sauces.  While this one is good, I find it a bit boring compared to others.  It does add a little kick but the flavor is lacking.  There are a lot of sauces that add pure heat but either the heat is overwhelming or the flavor is completely lacking.  My number one favorite hot sauce is:<br /><br />Yucatan Sunshine Habanero Pepper Sauce - [..]<br /><br />It's about as spicy but the flavor is fantastic!  I put it on Mexican food, pasta, etc.  I always have a few bottles of this around and give them away to friends pretty regularly.

review/summary: Favorite of the planters.
review/text: This is definitely my favorite Planters trail mix.  With a good mix of crunchy and spicy you'll eat one of these and go back for another bag.  I used to order the bigger version of this but I would wind up eating the whole bag in a couple sittings, so in order to help curb my addiction I buy the smaller bags and limit how many I have around at a time.  That being said I think if you're looking for a different type of trail mix with a little heat and a lot of crunch buy this.

review/summary: Great spicy snack
review/text: We go backpacking and camping a lot.  This snack is perfect for those types of activities because it takes the edge off hunger, provides much needed calories (each bag has 310 calories), and is spicy enough to give that little extra "kick" just when you need it.  If you don't lead an active lifestyle, you may want to consider snacks with a lower calorie count.  If you are constantly on the go, however, this snack will help get you from meal to meal.

Instead of the package being sealed it was melted, in several cases it was melted and left the product exposed. Much of the order was lying loose in the box. No where in the description did it say this was a salvage item. Had I known ahead of time that these were factory rejects, salvage or damage products I would have reconsidered this purchase.

Great Smokey flavor, they just get more and more hot. I ate 4 in one night and had a stomach problem but that was my own fault. Definitely don't eat them in excess. A buddy of mine didn't use his brain too much when it came to eating these. He was under the water faucet for awhile cuz he couldn't handle the burn. Anyway, great product. Add them to your food!

review/text: My friends all love my chili, no beans spiced with 3 kinds of dried chilis,fresh ground cumin etc.  Usually I leave most of the seeds but this time I was meticulous about picking them out.  For spice I added 2 of these (in a tea ball)  When the chili was done I removed the tea ball and mashed the peppers with 2 oz. of finished chili.  Iwould not let anybody use more than 1/4 teaspoon per bowl to spice it up.  Most of these guys are heat freaks but no one asked for more hot and three went and added more chili to calm it down.  I was proud,

review/text: I just received the peppers today in the mail, and I must say, they're hot! Three of my friends including myself split one in thirds to try it, and that was already hot. We plan on eating a full one each in a few days.<br /><br />One thing with these being dried, is that they're not really flavourful, but they really pack a punch and I have plenty to go through. The shipping did take one day short from the maximum they said, but it was definitely worth waiting.<br /><br />Great product! Shall be buying from them again.

review/summary: Not as good as the 18 gram batch
review/text: These are good, and if you like ghost chili's then don't get me wrong you have a good batch here. However this batch screams quantity > quality, because smelling the peppers as a whole smelt like cardboard in some parts. And a few peppers I ate tasted like that (still had the spice though), so it feels like with this batch someone takes all the bhut jolokia peppers they harvest, ignoring the strange smelling ones. So while it's a good batch overall and most of the peppers are good, the 18 gram is all perfect quality peppers, all of them ripe and not giving off the musty cardboard smell. So if you want quantity this is perfect, but if you want quality buy a couple of the 18 grams.

These peppers will mainly be used for topping off my pizza and other foods. I ground most of it up, and the peppers will be used to spice up dishes. These are a lot hotter than Thai chillies, however I love the flavor from the ghost chillies. I saved a few in the original package since since it came in a Ziploc type package. Thanks for the fast shipping and I'll be buying more!

The peppers have a rather citrus like flavor with ample capsaicin to spice up any dish. However, I must warn that these peppers would be excessively spicy to the average person. Please use and handle them responsibly.<br /><br />I received my shipment very quickly with absolutely no problems. I will gladly order from this seller again in the future.

It SMELLS like a really hot sauce, it has that kicking burn, but only in scent. Its kinda warm in the taste department, but its not a lasting heat at all. Amazing flavor. and I should mention the nutrition facts are surprisingly healthy as well, 40 cal for 2 Tablespoons.<br />Could easly be used as a salad dressing.
