review/summary: Not bad
review/text: I am by no means a coconut expert but, I do know taste. Roland's coconut milk is light and creamy, with a hint of coconut. It is relatively sweetless, so if your looking for something that has very little sugar with a nice after taste, this is it. It is very smooth but the only thing which is a downer is there are tiny bits of coconut milk that have condensed. Not bad but if you don't use enough sugar it will be a bit disappointing.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  E.A.C

review/summary: Creamy, Smooth, Better Than 'So Delicious'
review/text: This brand was suggested by my nutritionist because of my milk intolerance. He doesn't like the 'So Delicious' box brand because it contains carrageenan.<br /><br />I was so glad for the reviews that said this needed to be diluted. I diluted in 2 quarts of water like another reviewer suggested and used a wisk to get the solidified fat to disperse evenly. It came out so smooth and silky, I just loved it.<br /><br />I did add some simple syrup to it to make it a little sweet. Perfect!<br /><br />One can did come dented. I used that one first.

review/summary: Good coconut milk
review/text: I really liked this product. I have so many cans that I don't even know what to do with them all! Each can contains coconut milk (organic) and guar gum (as a thickening agent). I wish I would've known about that extra ingredient but other than that, if you want coconut milk, this is where you should get it. Everything arrived on time and the packaging was just right. Oh by the way, it arrived on time too. :)

review/text: The product inside the can is very good. I use it for cooking.<br />The packaging is inadequate. Half of the cans arrived severely dented. I opened the most mis-shapen can and saw no breach in the seal of the container; so I still used it despite misgivings.<br /> I saw that Amazon does not accept return of this canned product. Also I got no request for feedback except as to the adequacy of the packaging, so I feel they must be aware of the faulty and inadequate packaging.<br /> Roland Coconut Milk, Organic, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)

review/summary: Not one can was usable.
review/text: Inside the undamaged Amazon shipping box, we found an already opened, but undamaged, 24 can Roland case container. The end had been cleanly cut from that box and then re-fitted over the opening, without being taped. Inside the Roland box were 24 damaged cans. Not a single can was not damaged in some way, the majority of them being severely dented. The sheer number of damaged cans, and the variety of that damage, in an undamaged box, was such that we concluded these were previously damaged cans collected into the case container we received. We contacted Amazon and their response was immediate and gratifying, as has always been the rule with them. As for the product itself, it is not one we would consider ordering again.

review/summary: Thick and delicious!
review/text: I bought the product before and the "coconut milk" came out to be watery and very greasy... NOT milky at all. I complained to Roland, they told me the problematic batch I bought was from Sri Lanka, and they have stopped buying from the supplier since. They also sent me new cans, this time from Thailand. Upon opening, there's thick layer of cream at the mouth of the can, and also more thick coconut cream on the bottom of the can. After mixing the coconut cream and milk together, the result is VERY creamy and luscious! I made a variation of sweet Malaysian dessert soup, Pulut Hitam, with black rice and pumpkin, very tasty!! The warm sweet coconut soup is perfect for the cooler fall weather!

After opening, every can was dented, even the ones that were in the middle of the case.  I could maybe understand if the outside parameter of cans were dented. I believe from the look of this case they are sending these out of factory already damaged.

review/summary: The canned tuna of smoked salmon...
review/text: I'm afraid this smoked salmon is too mushy...too watery and bland. My cat goes crazy for it though so I guess this is going in the kitty treat section. It's not awful (I love canned tuna) but, it's definitely not like the vacuum packed smoked salmon you can buy locally which is much firmer and doesn't have a ton of water (lame).<br /><br />At least this is wild caught and it could be worse which is why I'm giving this 3 stars. This would probably be fine for a recipe but eaten on its own leaves something to be desired.

review/summary: WONDERFUL snack, side, dessert, or salad  or stir-fry ingredient
review/text: These mandarin oranges are extraordinary.  First, packed in water, they taste like real oranges, not like sugared soda with fiber in it.  Second, juicy and flavorful, they're great for adding to yogurt or cereal in the morning, eating as a side dish or dessert at any meal, or adding to delicious salads or stir-fries.  Third, they're so good that, when I'm craving cookies or a chocolate bar, instead I eat these oranges right out of the can and feel completely satiated!  I now keep extra cans plus a can opener in the car and grab one whenever too much time on the road is prompting me to think that a quick swing through a fast-food drive-in line might be appropriate.  :)  Drink the juice, too:  it keeps you hydrated and has many fewer calories than straight fruit juice, since there's so much water.  A lovely, refreshing snack, a sort of fruit-flavored water with extra fiber and great mouth feel!  :)<br /><br />When the first case of 24 arrived, I was a little perturbed.  So many?  and how long would it take me to finish them?  I was thinking years...  but now, after 2 weeks, they're almost gone, and I'm worried because they're no longer in stock.  Will Amazon get more in time to fill my next order in only 2 weeks???  A case of 24 is starting to look awfully small indeed.<br /><br />(I shouldn't be telling you all how good they are -- you'll just be competing with me for the limited number Amazon seems to stock!)  :)

review/text: Who needs sugar or syrup to cover up the real fruit taste of juicy mandarin oranges? We were pleased to find this product and enjoy the quality of the large firm segments.  Once we tasted the pure unadulterated fruit we realized that most of the sugared up versions were masking or dressing up their lower quality pieces of fruit.<br /><br />Recommended not just for those who need to watch their sugar intake, but for any concerned with eating for health and taste.

review/text: What a great find! I am addicted to mandarin oranges and eat them nightly and love that a whole can of these only have 135 calories vs. 300 or more like the other brands with heavy syrup or even light syrup. There is also no added sweetener so you can sweeten them with the sweetener of your choice if you choose to do so. They are delicious just as they are but sometimes when I am craving something really sweet I will add a little Splenda. These are good quality mandarin oranges and I am about to buy my second case! This comes out to about the same price I pay for mandarin oranges at the grocery store only these arrive at my door! Can't beat it!

review/summary: Smaller than expected, but still good
review/text: Purchased this because of the special offer from Amazon (4-for-3.)  When I received them in the mail, I was surprised at how small they were.  Each sliver seems to be about 1/3 the size of the pig ears I used to buy.  But each bag weighs a bit over 16 oz / 1 lb (bag included, I'm guessing about 14-15 oz of actual ears.)  So compared to what I used to buy at Wal-Mart, this is a pretty good discount.<br /><br />Oh, and the dog (terrier) seems to like them alright - and I'm pretty sure that's what actually matters.

review/text: Overall, I'm pleased with the quality of these chews. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because a number of the strips are cut in such a way that they have sharp slender points. I have 2 Springer Spaniel pups that love these things so much that they try to gulp them down without much chewing. I keep a close eye on my pups while they eat these chews to ensure that they don't get caught in their throats. We have had one get caught in the roof of the mouth. I sometimes smash the points with a hammer just for my own peace of mind. The dogs love 'em. I have to keep them in the laundry room because they can smell them (I can't) if I keep them in the kitchen which leads to begging and pawing.

review/summary: Dogs are happy, therefore I am happy :)
review/text: We own two dogs who are drastically different in sizes. I've always preferred the slivers because my smaller dog can manage them better, and I pick out the larger pieces for my bigger dog. I normally get them from the pet store but needed an extra item to add to my order to put it over 25 bucks ( yay for free shipping ). The price is cheaper here than I normally pay and my smaller dog, who is WAY more picky seems to like these better than the ones from the pet store we shop at. The size of the slivers are more constant as well. There are still some bigger than others but none of the tiny crumbs of pieces you can sometimes find in other brands.<br /><br />Overall if my dogs are happy with them, I am happy with them and they seem to be. Plus the price is great just another bonus.

That may be a generous ratio to give.<br /><br />So all in all in my opinion there are better deals for this type of item...<br /><br />So where do I get my dogs pig ears--<br /><br />ALDI grocery store--- they have a company "SHEP" that produces some dog items for that chain of stores.<br /><br />About $3 or $4 buys you 5 regular (LARGE) pig ears.

review/summary: Made in USA, but Very Sharp Pointy Edges
review/text: After reading the reviews here about made in China, I was pleased to find that they must have been mistaken, ..... that the product is clearly labeled, Made In USA.<br /><br />The product is fun for the dog, I have a 3 lb chihuahua, and he loves them.  They are varying sizes, I'm sure ANY size dog could enjoy them.  My worry is that they are VERY pointy - sharp as a knife.  I watch him very carefully.  I have also filed down some of the points with a commercial metal file.  That was an easier option for me than returning, no matter how easy Amazon returns are, I hate to have to return things.<br /><br />I see other Smokehouse products that I can try instead, so all in all I'm happy with the Manufacturer and the product quality.<br /><br />So, while I give the product 5 stars for flavor and appeal, being made in USA, quality fresh when received - I have to deduct 2 stars for having to file down points.<br /><br />For those that want a list of dog-treat/food Companies that are certified MADE IN USA, check this website: [...] and then find the area that is dog-made-in-the-usa.  On the left, they have two brand lists, the top list is for the USA page, refine by company, etc.  Click see more to see the entire list - - the ones they carry that are NOT made in the USA are grayed out.  NOT made in USA, those include Beefeaters and Busybuddy!!!!  - much to my surprise.  I could have sworn Beefeaters said it had it's facilities FDA and HACCP certified on their About Us on their website.  That would say to me that they are USA, but no where on their site does it actually state Made in USA, so hmmmm.  Guess it's good to investigate.

review/summary: My Lab loves them.
review/text: THE GOOD:  My Lab loves these.  They are slivers not the whole ear which is easier for my old dog to chew on.<br /><br />THE BAD:  It would be better if the bag would be a zip-lock type - but they don't last long.  So that really is not a big con.<br /><br />OVERALL:  a good purchase, would buy another.

review/summary: My dog loves these
review/text: I have a 8 month old mixed (mutt) poodle that current weighs in at about 15 pounds. The package arrive while the dog was outside. I took a piece out and placed it in the dog's bed. When I let the dog back in, it sniffed around a few seconds and then made a bee line for the bed. I swear, this little dog acts as if these pig slivers are treats.<br /><br />Good enough for me to recommend them. :)<br /><br />Ken

review/summary: My dogs love them but there's not much chewing involved
review/text: So far none of the 'chew' items I've found anywhere give my 2 crazy dogs any significant chew time...they just eat them in about a minute and a half (same thing for those huge expensive 'rawhide bones'.)  I guess I need smaller dogs, but meanwhile my 2 canine cannibals love these...so more are in the re-order hopper.<br />Sigh.

review/text: I was a bit surprised as some of the reviews here complained about the size. While not nearly as big as a standard pig ear, these make great tasty treats for my 60lb dogs. Much larger than I thought and I'm going to order a bunch more. Great price and product. A big 'Paws Up' from my two Boxers!

review/text: The product is very economical, as far as pig ears go. If you have a large dog or are really wanting to keep your dog busy for a while, get the whole pig ear. Our terrier puppy finishes the strips pretty quickly, but our older Sheltie likes the strips better than a full pig ear.

review/summary: Smelly+Crunchy=Puppy's favorite treat
review/text: Our 4-mo old terrier is teething so she really lives up to her breed's rep. I got these after reading the reviews on Amazon, and our pup loves them. She goes off by herself and gnaws on one strip for about 30-40 min. We can clean the house, do laundry in another room, and eat dinner in peace with these silvers. It's almost like magic!<br /><br />It is very greasy and there is definitely a smoky-sort of scent to these things. I think that's why she likes it. I hide a silver in one of her toys, and can leave the house without her even noticing that I'm gone. Highly recommended if your dog is teething, a terror (sorry, terrier!), and likes crunchy smelly treats!

Often used to flavor food or treats but should be used sparingly.<br />Products sweetened with Xylitol This common artifical sweetener can cause a sudden drop in blood sugar resulting depression, loss of coordination, and seizure<br /><br />Some additional foods to avoid<br /><br />Baby Food Could contain onion powder so read label carefully (see onions, above).<br />Cherry, Peach, Plum, & Apricot Pits, Apple & Pear Seeds Contain cyanogenic glycosides which can result in cyanide poisoning. It is best to avoid all pits and seeds unless you know them to be safe.<br />Chicken or Fish Bones Can splinter, causing lacerations and can also cause obstructions. (please note that RAW chicken bones are okay...its the uncooked ones that splinter and cause major issues)<br />Green Potato Skins Contains a toxin, solanine, which is only found in green tubers and green potato skins. Cooked potatoes are safe and nutritious for dogs.<br />Hops (used in making beer) Causes panting, increased heart rate, elevated temperature, seizures and death.<br />Milk and Dairy Products Like people, some dogs can be lactose intolerant, resulting in diarrhea.<br />Mushrooms Depending on the mushroom, toxic effects include damage to the liver, heart, or kidneys causing death.<br />Turkey Skin The high fat content in turkey skin can cause acute Pancreatitis in dogs.<br />Raw Salmon Those feeding their dogs a raw diet, please avoid raw salmon which can contain a parasite that causes an illness (SPD) with a 90% mortality rate.<br />Raw Eggs Best to avoid since it can cause a depletion of biotin and be contaminated with salmonella.<br />Sugar Bad for teeth and could contribute to the onset of Diabetes.<br />Tomatoes/Tomato Plants Contains toxins known to cause dilated pupils, tremors and irregular heartbeat. The leaves and stems of tomato plants are the most toxic followed by unripe (green) tomatoes and ripe (red) tomatoes.<br />Walnuts & most nuts Walnuts are poisonous to dogs. Many nuts are not good for dogs in general; their high phosphorus content is said to possibly lead to bladder stones."

review/summary: Tea-riffic value & quality
review/text: While looking online for bulk organic loose-leaf tea, I came across this brand and pouch size here on Amazon.  It's the lowest cost I found, especially for an organic tea.  I can't vouch for its use in IBS, not having that problem myself, but I know that the oil content is very good, and the flavor is reasonable - a bit coarse and slightly bitter, but definitely palatable.  It's soothing and relaxing, settles my stomach, and opens my nasal passages.<br /><br />I have two recommendations when using this tea:<br /><br />1. Use a BUNCH of it; be generous with the amount of leaves when brewing.<br /><br />2. Use quite hot but /not/ boiling water to brew; when I boiled a teapot of water and then right away poured it on the leaves, I vaporized the essential oil.

review/summary: Great tasting tea
review/text: This is one of the best peppermint teas I have ever tasted.  It is much stronger than the bag teas you will find in local grocery stores.  I purchased it to help calm my IBS and it really does a good job of calming the GI.  My only complaint is that I wish the bag was resealable.  I had to purchase a tea canister because you cannot keep it in this bag without loosing the effects of the tea.  If you want really strong tea, then (in my opinion) follow the package directions.  I have had to water it down a bit because the peppermint oil is a bit too strong for my system.  The bag is huge and a little really goes a long way.  I am sure this will last for several months.  Be sure to by a nice tea infuser - this is the best way to enjoy this tea.  I purchased the Adagio Teas Personal sized tea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket and it is working well.

review/text: This has been my yummy summer treat as part of my iced tea creations I've been making with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J5FN48">Mr. Coffee TM70 3-Quart Iced-Tea Maker</a>. This is the most potent mint flavor you are likely to experience. I use this as part of a mix with either <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0IS">Eco Teas Organic Yerba Mate, Loose, 16-Ounces (Pack of 3)</a>or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OFJ79S">Bigelow� Lemon Ginger Herb Plus Probiotics (Box of 18)</a> most of the time. But I'm still experimenting.<br />I can't address how this product works for Irritable Bowel Syndrome.<br />I can say though that the difference between this and any other mint tea I've encountered so far is dramatic. This is some of the tastiest stuff in the world. I don't see myself willing to be without this product.

review/summary: Awesome Tea!
review/text: I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother, who has a terrible time finding good assortments of decaf tea.  She called me just the other day and asked me where I found it, because she had already tried 3 or 4 different varieties and loves them all.  I highly recommend Davidson's tea, and will definitely be making future purchases from them.

These cheaper kits give you a quick turnaround with a decent wine(a lighter variety than the better kits produce-a little less balanced). So far the whites have tasted better to me.  The first 3 kits were made as to instructions, with the next 2 (Pinot Biano and Rosso Magnifico) I reduced the water added to make about 5.25 gals of of must and racked off into a 5 gal carboy. Don't know what to expect but will follow up this review. I did notice that the reduced water version takes much longer to degas.

review/summary: Useful at home too
review/text: This product can be very useful for anyone who prepares low calorie sweetened drinks in larger than single-serving amounts.<br /><br />My family and I drink a lot of iced tea. Bottled teas cost a lot and powdered tea mixes taste pretty awful, so I began to brew fresh tea one gallon at a time. Because we also prefer to avoid empty sugar calories, I was tearing open 20 little packets of Equal for each pitcher of lemon iced tea. That was tedious and I didn't like throwing away a zillion little blue paper shreds either.<br /><br />My solution? I bought this one pound bulk package of Equal. Now I just pour 20 grams of Equal into a gallon of tea (I use my kitchen scale to get the sweetness just right) and add lemon juice. Bingo! I like it better than bottled teas -- fresher-tasting, not so sweet -- and it's much cheaper, there are no empty bottles to throw away/recycle and I can serve as much tea as I want at the moment.<br /><br />One pound of Equal sounded like an awful lot for home use until I realized that we were already buying boxes of 800 Equal packets from the local big box store -- there's more than a pound of Equal in each of those boxes. One pound of bulk Equal is enough for 23 gallons of iced tea sweetened to my taste -- about 4 months worth, though obviously Your Mileage May Vary.<br /><br />Now I'm even thinking of buying Amazon.com's bulk Equal in six-packs. That would get me a better price per pound plus free shipping -- a 60% drop in price for buying a two year supply of Equal. Hmmm...

review/text: Fiddyment Farms' products are simply amazing.  My favorite, the Butter Toffee Pistachios, which come in 1LB bags, have to be hidden from plain sight to make sure no one eats them.  Why?  Because everyone who has tried them, keep coming back for more.  My recent order came mid transit during our seasonal temperature change and thus were in bad condition.  One email to Fiddyment Farms and Adrianna from customer service took care of me.  She sent out replacement bags in advance, emailed me a prepaid shipping label for the ones I was returning, and she even sent out a sample bag of one of their other products (Mandarin Orange Pistachios) that I was inquiring about.  Don't be afraid of their shipping charges.  If you order in bulk, I usually order at least 5- 1LB bags at a time, they will discount the shipping charges.  Great products and great customer service will make me a Fiddyment Farms customer for life!  I'm warning you in advance, the Butter Toffee Pistachios are highly addictive.

review/summary: Hooked on Rubschlager European Whole Grain
review/text: Great bread...period. When I was stationed at Thule Air Base on the Danish territorial island of Greenland, I would always see this bread placed in a large aluminum-serving tray next to the breads all of us Americans were familiar with. The Danes ran the mess hall, and most of the other infrastructure on the base, and they served many dishes that were Danish. I finally tried the thin and darker bread, and for the rest of my tour I devoured a ton of it. In the many intervening years between then and now, it was a rare treat to find it in supermarkets. Rubschlager makes other kinds, but this is my favorite, and it was the one that always sold out first. I couldn't understand why the buyers for the supermarket didn't notice the trend, and buy more of the European Whole Grain. So, I was forced to wait until the next shipment...until I found it on Amazon. Now it's always on hand for sandwiches, as dinner bread, and a quick evening healthy snack with some light health smart spread.

review/summary: Flavor okay, not great
review/text: I struggled with rating this bar a 3 or a 4.  Taste is only about a 3, but quality of ingredients in providing a healthy and edible alternative to a candy bar rates it a solid 4. Below is the gist a a review I wrote for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ENWSBW">Larabar Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Cherry Pie</a> comparing it with the PURE Wild Blueberry Bar.<br /><br />When I was searching for a healthier between meal afternoon snack I read a lot of reviews for a lot of products.  I wanted something with few ingredients, not "fortified" and with some nuts in it.  I settled on the Larabar Fruit & Nut Cherry Pie bars and the PURE Bar Organic Wild Blueberry Living Food Bar.  I love cherries and I love blueberries so they seemed like good choices.<br /><br />The stats of the bars are very similar, weight (both 1.7oz, not 1.8), calories, fat, sugars, etc.  The PURE has more protein at 6g vs 4g.  The Larabar has no sodium while the PURE has just a bit at 5mg.  The Larabar is thicker, the PURE bar is wider.  Visually the Larabar appears to have more nuts in it, which doesn't seem to jive with the protein stats.  The PURE bar has a grittier texture while chewing so maybe more of the nuts are finely ground.<br /><br />1st ingredient is dates for both followed by almonds and then cherries for the Larabar and followed by blueberries and various nuts, organic agave nectar, rice protein and lemon juice for the PURE bar.  One would think with the extra ingredients in the PURE bar they were added to tweak the flavor or give it a fresher taste, but the flavor of the Larabar is better than the PURE by a pretty good margin.  It has a much fresher and lively taste.  I have to say the PURE bar is a bit cardboardy tasting to me and has a drier mouth feel.  It is not bad, in fact my 2 youngest kids eat them readily, just not nearly as good as the Larabar.  I think the tartness of the cherries in the Larabar kick up the flavor vs the milder blueberry flavor of the PURE (maybe the lemon juice add as an attempt to kick up the PURE bar flavor and tartness?).  In fairness I should probably review the PURE Cherry Cashew bar but I much prefer almonds over cashews so don't plan on ordering any from Amazon.  If I stumble on the PURE cherry in a regular store I will give one a try though.  I still get both auto shipped from Amazon for variety sake, but am looking for a better tasting blueberry bar w/ basic ingredients including nuts.<br /><br />For grins here is a comparison of the Larabar, PURE, Snickers, Hershey's and Maruchan Chicken Ramen noodles in a few categories.  Stats are listed in the order I listed them in the previous sentence.<br /><br />Calories:  190, 190, 280, 210, 380<br />Total Fat:  8g, 9, 14, 13, 14  Saturated Fat:  0.5g, 1, 5, 8, 7<br />Sugars:  21g, 20, 30, 24, 0<br />Protein:  4g, 6, 4, 3, 10<br />Sodium:  0mg, 5, 140, 35, 1540 !!!<br /><br />UPDATE Nov 11, 2009  PURE has changed this bar.<br /><br />I got my regular shipment and noticed the bars came in a newly shaped box and new packaging.  Total fat went from 9g to 8g and they eliminated all sodium.  Total carbs edged up to 26g from 25g.  Protein remains 6g and calories at 190.<br /><br />The BIG CHANGE is that "Organic Wild Blueberries" drops from the 2nd item listed on the ingredients list to the 5th!  Blueberries are now after not only dates but walnuts, cashews and rice proein concentrate.  Bumping up the nut content would not be a bad thing, but since the total fat actually decreased and carbs increased, I think the nut quantity actually decreased along with the blueberries, but the date quantity increased.  This seems to basically be a date bar w/ nuts now and some minor blueberry content.  I'd love to see the actually quantity of blueberries in this bar.  Ironically, I can actually see blueberries scattered in the new bar, whereas the old bar was more of a dense blended mush.  The bar is noticeably lighter in color now (and density)...more tan than blue.  The new packaging implies a longer slimmer bar shape, but oddly the actual bar is shorter, wider and a tad thicker...package marketing?  The total weight is unchanged at 1.7oz.  I'm still looking for an alternative blueberry bar...I imagine cost is a big factor in blueberry content.  My 2 kids will still eat these but they noticed the change right away and are not impressed.

review/summary: Exactly as Advertised
review/text: This bar is the closest thing I've ever experienced to eating a brownie fresh from the oven in a packaged food.  I have no idea how the folks at Pure Bar managed to make a chocolate bar that tastes so much like baked goods, using only raw and living ingredients, but it's wonderful that they have, and I mean to buy several more cases.  Any of the store bought brownies you've had won't satisfy you like this will - Entemanns and Hostess are not nearly as delicious and warm-tasting, and the health food and energy bars I've had that are chocolate flavored always end up tasting like wheat germ or oats.  It's easy to carry, one bar fills me up, and as a chocolate fan, I am happy to see that Pure Bar uses raw cacao powder - the real deal, and not carob chocolate substitutes.  You can definitely taste the difference.  This particular Pure Bar product makes for the best tasting snackfood or dessert I've ever eaten out of a wrapper, and unless you're on a completely raw vegan diet, it's going to be better for you than whatever meal you ate just beforehand!  If you like chocolate like I do, you're going to love this.  It's a soft, gooey brownie, pure and simple, walnuts and all.

review/text: Allow me to give you some frame of reference on me:  I'm not a vegan or even vegetarian, or sufferer of Celiac Disease.  If I fell into either one of those camps, I would instantly raise the rating at least a star.  But since I'm not adverse to occasionally ingesting an artificial ingredient or two, I'll give you the straight dope on this very healthy snack bar.<br /><br />The ingredient list is quite impressive, if only for the fact that someone who doesn't have a chemistry degree can understand it.  That in itself is refreshing.  They've even got a YES/NO breakdown printed next to the ingredients that goes something like this:<br /><br />YES!:  Certified Organic, Gluten-Free, Full Serving [of] Fruit, Organic Protein, Rich in Omega-3s, Good Source of Fiber, Raw, Vegan<br /><br />NO!:  Refined Sugars, Gluten Dairy or Soy, Cholesterol, Trans Fats, Preservatives, GMOs, Artificial Nothin'<br /><br />WOW!  5-STARS SO FAR!  Let's tear this thing open!<br /><br />At first glance, it looks just like holiday fruitcake that's been mashed with a rolling pin.  Mmmmm...  Maybe that's why it doesn't need preservatives and the expiration date is almost a full year in the future.  Smells a lot like fruitcake, too.  I lost my first test subject (my wife) on looks and smell alone.  (Minus 1 star for lack of family appeal -- I don't count the kids' outright rejection.)<br /><br />The first bite redeemed the bar.  It's tastier than I'd anticipated, full flavored and sweet without being powdery or sugary.  I think I might like this.<br /><br />The second bite lost the other star instantly.  I felt like I almost broke a tooth on a rather large fruit pit.  Guess I should have paid closer attention to the disclaimer on the wrapper that states, "May contain pieces of nuts, shells, stems, or pits."  I found a stem in the other half of the bar.<br /><br />As good as this fruit bar may be for me, I don't think I should have to strain it prior to eating it.  I have enjoyed similarly nutritious bars in the past and not one thought of seeking a dentist.<br /><br />Though the PURE BAR is EVERYTHING they promise (pits and all), I'll probably do some more "research" (read: taste tests) on other healthy snack bars before buying a case.  I will, however, recommend this bar to a family member who needs a Gluten-free diet, because it tastes significantly better than most Gluten-free snacks I've sampled.<br /><br />Just be careful and take small bites.

review/text: The best part about this bar is that (unlike most others) I cannot taste the dates.  They're a little sweet, but not too much so; the tartness of the cherries helps balance things out.  I take these with me for breakfast or a snack to classes, and it helps fight off any hunger while I get some protein.  I've also found that it is more filling if I drink it with something (juice or a bottle of water) and can make a quick meal.

review/text: I tried Pure Bars after seeing them reviewed on a health website. The site waxed poetic about the flavor, as well as the extremely high quality ingredients, but I figured "right -- these bars all end up tasting like dates no matter what flavor they are". Well, I stand corrected, the flavor on these bars is excellent and is by far the best I've tasted (and I've tasted quite a few). That's a real bonus, considering the fact that the ingredients are completely raw and organic and the whole bar is relatively low on the glycemic index. To those unfamiliar with raw food bars, take note: if you're expecting any of them to taste like "granola" bars or candy bars, you'll be disappointed. Think fruit sweet instead and your expectations will be met. I can also vouch for the fact that my 2.5 year old daughter loves them. On to the chocolate next...

They looked somewhat like ants, but I wasn't sure what they were.  Just gross little crawly things creeping around inside and outside of the box.  I say beware because the bugs are tiny and you might think that they're not there when you open the package.  My advice would be to let the internal box of bars sit outside your cupboard on a counter for a day and see if you notice any bugs before you co-mingle the box with your household food. Gross, gross, gross.  So unhappy because other than that, these bars are great.  But I will never order them online from Amazon again.

review/summary: small bar for a high price with an untrue claim and hidden fructose
review/text: As a person who is more involved with health and nutrition than the average person that has also purchased raw food bars before, I was happy that this was offered though the Amazon Vine program and I glady ordered the sample.  It tastes good and it claims to contain "nothing cooked, nothing processed," but that is not the simple truth.  The bar contains "agave nectar" which does not occur naturally.  It is not unprocessed and it is in fact, a highly cooked and processed sweetener.  It is derived from processing and cooking the core of the blue agave plant for many hours in order to break down its starches into sugars.  Agave nectar was originally touted as a "healthy alternative" to table sugar, but it is potentially much worse than table sugar on your body.  It is essentially a super high fructose syrup, just like high fructose corn syrup, but with a much higher fructose content.  Typical high fructose corn syrup used in soft drinks is about 55% fructose while agave nectar contains a whopping 85-90% fructose.  First of all, I don't understand why they thought they needed to sweeten this "raw" bar, and second, they used "agave nectar" which sounds good to the uninformed, but it is not a raw ingredient and it has a very high fructose content.  I think they used "agave nectar" to hide the additional fructose (or sugar) on the label.  There is controversy, but fructose and particularly agave nectar may be bad for you.<br /><br />You can research for yourself, google "agave nectar bad"<br /><br />and look for entries from "foodrenegade," "nourishedkitchen" and "living-foods"<br /><br />You can also google "fructose bad"<br /><br />check out the hits from "about" and "the american journal of clinical nutrition"<br /><br />Fructose and in particular, High Fructose Corn Syrup are the subjects of much controversy today.  There are studies that conclude that there is no appreciable difference between sucrose and fructose to our bodies (and of course, fructose is a component of sucrose).  There are also studies that indicate fructose may be problematic.  Regardless of which camp you're in, "agave nectar" is a hidden source of fructose in this bar and it is not raw.  The fact that the manufacturer of this bar claims "nothing cooked and nothing processed" is nothing short of fraud.

review/summary: Not terrible but I won't purchase again
review/text: Usually, I go to Whole Foods and try to buy a single bar of a brand or flavor I haven't tried before purchasing an entire box... & I should have followed that rule before making this purchase.<br /><br />Ordinarily, I love the tart twang of cranberry and orange together - but the additional ingredients in this bar made it overly sweet for my taste.  I also found the texture to be quite gritty and overly moist.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars for the quality of the ingredients and because it would likely appeal to those who enjoy REALLY sweet fruit treats.<br /><br />I think in the future I will go back to Lara Bars.

review/summary: These Are Soooo Good!
review/text: I don't know how these would taste if one is used to eating junk foods and cooked foods, but I have been eating only raw foods for two months and these bars are really a special treat.  The chocolate in them is as pleasing to me as any chocolate cake, brownie, or candy bar ever was when I used to eat junk foods - even more so because I know that they are healthy and I am truly satisfied once I am finished with the bar!

review/text: This bar is like having a piece of apple pie without the guilt!!! I would highly recommend this bar!  I have tried so many "health bars" and when I opened them up they all tasted dry and like cardboard....YUK!  Not this one!

review/summary: Delicious and Handy! (And ridiculously cute!)
review/text: If you like the taste of strawberry Pocky or strawberry Yan Yan, you will like these.  My fiance and I have an  American palette, but we were hooked on Hello Panda ever since he bought the "Milk" (Vanilla) flavor on a whim from the international aisle of a supermarket.<br /><br />They arrive in individual boxes packed in a display box (like at a store).  The individual packaging make them easy to throw in a bag or purse on the go (easy for pacifying fussy kids too!), and the individual outer cardboard package means these creme-filled cookies don't get crushed by your water bottle. :)

review/summary: Hello Panda Chocolate Cream Filled Mini Cookies.
review/text: These little chocolate cream filled cookies are pretty darn good.  I sent a few boxes with a friend of mine to take to work with her.  The people she works with devoured what she handed out and they were asking for more.  Looks like those folks will be placing orders with Amazon.com for more of these little chocolate cream filled devils.  Thanks Amazon.com.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I bought these when I couldn't find the Choco-Koala cookies we usually buy. These are great little cookies and seem just like the Choco-Koala cookies. A light crunchy exterior with a wonderful chocolate center. They are small, so you can quickly chow down quite a few. Very, very yummy. Santa always remembers to bring some for the kids. Don't buy just a few boxes, get the whole case!

review/summary: Toddlers & Pre-Schoolers love them!
review/text: I bought these for a Halloween party with a lot of 2 & 3 year olds.  My kiddos treats were the hit, all the kids loved them and asked their parents for more.  Several parents said they snuck some of the cookies from their kids and loved them.  A fun snack for all!

review/text: Saw it at F.Y.E. At there unlike Amazon it was only $3.00. It was worth buying after I tryed it out. Taste like a fortune cookie with vanilla filling inside of it. Love it and yes would highly recommed.

review/text: These are made with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil; an adult can make the choice whether to eat them or not.  But why give them to kids with a perpetual sweet tooth who don't know any better?

review/text: I was very unhappy with this purchase. The almonds were shriveled up & actually chewy. I have never had almonds this stale. I didn't even know that almonds could be this stale. There is no packing or expiration date on them...so, god only knows how long they have been hanging around.  I got 2 bags of them & they are both crap. I will be sending these back. Humph!

review/summary: The Best Seasoning
review/text: This seasoning is so tasty. Just pour about a tablespoon over Ramen noodles. It has the perfect blend of spice and sesame. Once you try it you will be hooked. Excellent!!
