review/summary: Liked Numete? Try This
review/text: This is a solid peanut/corn meal/soy loaf you push out of the can and slice. You can also mash it up with mayo and make a sandwich spread. My aunt used to bake it with tomato sauce and onions. If you remember and liked Worthington Numete or Loma Linda Nuteena, which are no longer made, this is very similar. Cedar Lake also makes "Nutee Supreme" which is similar to this but darker, denser and has more of a soybean flavor whereas this is lighter and more cornmeal flavor.

review/summary: White corn even though it looks yellow in the picture
review/text: Yup, it's 10 pounds of clean, white corn.  I was looking all over the place for this stuff to make authentic tortillas with the masa grinder we got when we were in Nicaragua.  When we nixtamalize the corn with piclking lime, the corn does turn yellowish, unlike the white corn we used in Nicaragua, so we still haven't been able to get the pure white tortillas that we liked so much there, but this still tastes good, and it's one of the better prices I could find for only 10 pounds.  Otherwise, you have to buy 25-50 pounds of corn bulk, and I'm not going to do that until I find just the perfect corn.

review/text: Hi! I bought a case of Bean & Body Coffee Anti-Ox from Warehouse Deals. Thus the price was reduced. The drink was very good. I'd say flavor would have been better if item was not approaching the best by date. Fresher if newer but more expensive. That's my reason for 4 stars. Full price is a bit much in these times. Otherwise for a change from the more commonly found brands Bean & Body is a refreshing drink treat. I recommend you try this drink.

review/text: Mauna Loa Dry Roasted Macadamias with Sea Salt<br />You can't find these in most places so discovering them at Amazon was a stroke of luck. Costco used to carry them and now do not which forced me to look elsewhere.  These are the most flavorful and salted with sea salt for a special treat.  The secret is they are authentic Hawaiian.No other macadamias taste like these!!!

review/text: I used to dislike macadamia nuts until I tried these--These are absolutely amazing.  They taste nothing like the macadamia nuts you buy at the supermarket.  These have a velvety outer texture, some saltiness when you bite in, and then a buttery center that turns creamy in your mouth.  They should put a picture of these next to the word decadence in the dictionary.

review/summary: Some Costco's have 'em
review/text: Costco does sell them, just not all the Costco's. I'm in San Diego and have bought some in one location, then it disappears only to reappear in another location. They used to be $13 but now are $16 in the store (for those members who might be curious). Just bought a few 2 days ago in the store. Still a good deal on this site when you take into account shipping costs for the sellers which they are only passing on to you in the form of a higher price. Still, they aren't making but a few bucks on these after Amazon's 15% commission. The nuts are great but VERY salty. A trick to get rid of some salt, put them in a colander with a lot of holes and shake the nuts. You can also rinse them, but I found they absorb a lot of the water even if you let them sit out to dry. Others have recommmended washing them and then putting them in the oven for a few minutes. Worth the effort though. I like salt but holy cow these are consistently over the line.

review/summary: Tastey Nuts
review/text: These macadamias are the tastiest nuts you can get.  I'm not sure what the craze about "sea salt" is currently.  Isn't salt salt?  Does it have some sort of additional minerals?  I don't know and don't care enough to research it.  If someone wants to let me know in the comments section I will read it and be grateful that you solved the mystery for me.<br /><br />These nuts are expensive.  They have to be imported from Hawaii.  But they are round and have a meaty chewy quality and delicate flavor.  There are several nuts that only grow in the south Pacific and they have health properties in the oil when applied to the skin.  I can attest to that, being a surfer and out in the sun a lot.  I imagine that they are also healthy when eaten.  Macadamia nuts are the only type of nut allowed on a high protein diet.<br />One serving has a whopping 16 grams of monounsaturated fat, the kind that's good for you.  It also contains 2 grams of protein.  There is also traces of calcium and iron in them.  Of course there is all that sodium, 110 miligrams to be exact.<br /><br />I love them and am not allergic to them as I am to some other tree nuts.  They cost a lot but to me it's worth it.

review/summary: The REAL thing
review/text: These macadamia nuts are the ones I remember from my childhood.  They are dry roasted - not at all oily.  They have a silky and velvety crunch that is unlike any other food I can think of.  The taste is outstanding - toasted but not burnt, and salty but not in an overpowering way.<br /><br />The first macadamia nuts I ever ate were on an airplane.  They came in a little pyramid shaped container and they were the best things I had ever eaten.  These nuts taste just like those from 45 years ago.

review/text: I bought this product as a gift for a friend who likes to try various foods, but I noticed that it is way too salty.  Perhaps if you could wipe it off, or but the unsalted one it would taste better, but I simply think that if they reduced the salt to nut ratio, this would be a much better product.  I would not buy it again, but if you are dying to have some macadamia nuts from amazon that comes with good value, this would be an okay purchase.

I am very careful about the type of food I eat.<br /><br />Apart from this item, I buy all of my food at Whole Foods or local health food stores, so normally I would not be buying something from "Kirkland"<br /><br />However, I have to say these nuts are awesome - roasted perfectly (without oil - just dry roasted) and with only sea salt added. And since I eat a lot of them, have to buy in bulk. The Whole Foods brand macadamias are inferior to these - just not roasted enough - and cost significantly more.<br /><br />I give these 2 thumbs up!

review/text: I am fat, but I'm currently trying to change that. Not being a body builder I wondered if this product was for me, and I was very happy with the results. I keep these with me on days that I can't prepare a meal or when I am tired of my diet food and want something that has a little more hearty flavor. Caveat is: just like turkey-jerky, if you didn't know you were eating ostrich you might think that it tastes a bit different. Keep in mind that ostrich tastes more like chicken than beef.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Compact (will fit in cargo pocket)<br />Tasty<br />Fairly low salt<br />Semi-Moist (good or bad depending on your taste)<br />80 calories<br />Great for diets<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Hard to open sometimes<br />A bit large to fit in pocket (won't fit in standard pants pocket)<br />Co-workers think you are weird to eat Ostrich<br />A little expensive<br /><br />So, with all that said, I keep a box of these in my cupboard at all times just in case I need a snack and I don't want to go off-diet. Buy a box and see what you think.

review/summary: Has Sucralose!!!
review/text: This is suppose to be a "healthy" snack. Then they shouldn't sneak artificial sweeteners in. I do like the taste, but I'm going to have to go with another flavor. I got the applewood also and it looks like it doesn't have sucralose. So just be aware that different flavors will have different ingredients.

review/text: The jerky GODS sat high atop Mt. Olympus and pondered how they could make a delicious jerky that combines both beast and foul.  The solution was OSTRIM and the result is amazing!  This high protein, low fat tasty stick of goodness is the perfect snack on the go.  I pack this in my kids lunch boxes, in my workout bag and in my bedside drawer for a late night snack (kidding- but I totally could!)!  If you havent tried this yet- do it!

review/summary: Tasty source of protein
review/text: I didn't order these snack sticks from Amazon, but decided to give my review anyway. I'm required to get 60 grams of protein per day, so I have to be resourceful. I thought I'd try these sticks based on the many positive reviews. At first I was reluctant to eat them because of them being made from ostrich, but I couldn't taste anything different in them. They are delicious! They remind me of Slim Jim's but a lot better. They're not greasy and they're thicker. They are a bit difficult to chew, so be careful about that. Also, they're very filling. I could only eat half a stick at a time. I highly recommend this low-cal, high protein snack.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: Usually I don't bother to review products, but in this case I feel consumers should know that they're getting. I recently bought a jar of Polaner All Fruit with Fiber Raspberry jelly. The strange thing was it didn't taste like raspberry, nor did it taste good. I finally looked at the ingredients list, and found the following: Juce concentrates (pear, grape), maltodextrin, raspberries, fruit pectin, natural flavoring, citric acid. Raspberry was third down on the list, after maltodextrin.<br /><br />What I was tasting and had paid a premium price for was grape jelly! I thought Polaner produced premium products. No where on the front label did they say grape and pear were the predominant fruit. To my view, false advertising.

review/summary: Delicious taste, but you pay a premium to substitute fructose for sucrose
review/text: This jam is quite tasty and, like many other people who consume it, I choose it rather than a normal type of jam because it is lower in calories. However, I don't deceive myself that it won't raise blood sugar. Yes, this jam is, as the label states, "sweetened only with fruit juice." However, any jam which is not made with artificial sweeteners--which this one is not--inevitably derives the vast majority of its calories from some type of sugar. Because of this, the sweetener will appear first in the ingredient list, as is the case with this jam: "Juice concentrate (pear, grape), raspberries, maltodextrin (dietary fiber), fruit pectin, citric acid, natural flavor."<br /><br />This product is essentially almost 100% fructose because Polaner has substituted fructose for sucrose as a sweetener and it also is made from whole raspberries. This is a reduced-calorie jam because, since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose, the producers only need to use half as much of it as they would have of sucrose. Meaning that this jam has about half the calories of regular jam.<br /><br />If you have never had this jam before and are used to regular jam, this jam may taste different to you and initially you may think it isn't quite as sweet. To my own taste, though, since I'm used to eating this brand of fruit spread, it tastes quite sweet enough to me.<br /><br />As stated above, this product contains no artificial sweeteners of any kind. Virtually every artificial sweetener ever sold to the public has been associated with health hazards, including the most serious one of all, cancer, and less serious but quite aggravating problems such as headaches, allergies, brain fog, and digestive problems. This jam also contains no high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) which is currently the principle sweetener in processed foods in the United States. Fructose that occurs naturally in fruit--which is what is used in this jam--is one constituent of a whole food that has many other healthy nutrients within it, such as potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese, and zinc. In contrast, the fructose in HFCS is made from a chemical process. Not only is the fructose stripped entirely from the corn it used to be part of, it now contains unnatural chemicals as well, so nothing healthy remains for the body to utilize to nourish itself. In addition, when HFCS is consumed, it cannot be digested in the small intestines as fructose from fruit can. Instead, the liver has to process HFCS. The liver turns it into triglycerides which cause two main, interrelated health problems. They either are immediately stored by the body as unnecessary fat, leading to obesity, or they clog the arteries, which promotes heart disease and cancer. In addition, digesting HFCS is harmful to the liver, one of the most vital organs in the body.<br /><br />Though this low-cal product has sidestepped those two main issues, I do have a couple of health advisories about it for consumers. First, since the fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber, I am not sure why Polaner opted to add in maltodextrin and call that "fiber" too. Anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam. The producers claim on the label it is "gluten-free," but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn, and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten.<br /><br />A second problematic ingredient is its "natural flavor." It is possible that the producers have added raspberry extract, a chemically derived substance that has a taste similar to real raspberries, in order to get away with using less real raspberries, which are more expensive than flavoring. The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: "The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is anything but "natural," and shrouded in purposeful mystery so that the consumer is lulled into believing a product containing it is far more healthy than it actually is.

They said the simplest thing would be to return them for credit. This did not seem economically feasible, so I am breaking each one into small pieces which is very inconvenient.

review/summary: My all-time favorite bagel-chips.
review/text: I've tried a few varieties of Bagel chips, and by far, this is my favorite.  Most bagel chips use mini-bagels, cut horizontally.  You can tell because of the hole in the center.  Bagels are typically seasoned on the outside, sliced, then baked as chips.  If you get a chip that is close to the exterior of the bagel chances are good that you will get the seasoning (usually too much).  If you get an interior chip you will likely get too little seasoning (if any).  Some brands season the chips after they are cooked as well, which almost guarantees that you'll get far too much seasoning.<br /><br />Stacy's starts with regular, whole bagels; the same high-quality bagels that you will find on a supermarket or baker's sehlf.  Because these are sliced vertically, you get round chips that are all seasoned correctly on the outside ring.  Each chip is round and perfect for dipping or spreading.  I love regular bagels toasted with cream cheese, which is also good with Stacy's bagel chips.  However, these are good enough to warrant more creativity.  Try them with hummus, salsa, melted cheese--use your imagination.<br /><br />Yes, this is the same Stacy's that makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KGW2BY">Stacy's Pita Chips</a>.  All of Stacy's products are very high quality.  If you are a fan of everything bagels, you will love these.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZ2AZ0">Simply Naked Bagel Chips</a> are similar to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KGW2BY">Simply Naked Pita Chips</a>--simple, and delicious with dip. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZ3XKG">Everything Bagel Chips</a> are standard everything bagels, covered on the outside with seeds, onion, and garlic.  These are my favorite out of all the Stacy's bagel offerings.  If you like a bit of seasoning and don't like all of the extras, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P8FUXA">Toasted Garlic Bagel Chips</a> (I like these, but I miss the extras of the everything chips).

review/summary: Better than Tabasco
review/text: This is the best mass market hot sauce available. It's a tad more expensive than the big players such as Frank's or Tabasco, but the flavor is far superior and not overwhelmed by excessive heat.  There are hundreds of specialty hot sauces out there to choose from. Most are sold on the heat or the packaging but are rarely sold on the flavor.  My husband uses this sauce constantly and it works at every meal (even scrambled eggs).  He also uses it in his chilis and his spaghetti sauce.<br /><br />Here's a hint: In my husband's superb spaghetti sauce, he goes for intense garlic and basil.  He adds ground black pepper for a standard heat-- but just a hint.  He also adds a tablespoon of Cholula, too.  The Cholula lends just a slight touch of heat but adds a lot of complexity to the flavor, so the sauce remains an Italian spaghetti sauce, but certainly is tweaked so that there is no other sauce like it and few better!<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful and the wooden top is a nice touch.  When compared with any Tabasco, Cholula is superior!

review/summary: Versatile and not overpowering.
review/text: This is one of the best easily available hot sauces for regular people with normal tolerance<br />for spice.<br /><br />Cholula uses a blend of arbol and piquin peppers. Piquin peppers are actually very spicy, so I'd<br />imagine that the amount of pepper per batch is fairly low, because this sauce has no spice at all<br />for Heat Freaks like me, but a decent little kick for regular civilians. I would compare the spice<br />to a low-level, mild kick, similar to a standard Tabasco sauce or vinegar/cayenne/arbol pepper<br />combination.<br /><br />What it lacks in burning heat, it makes up for in solid flavor. Like basically all hot sauces, it<br />has a tangy vinegar base but contains a generous amount of spice for a robust, smokey tomato sort of<br />flavor. Piquin peppers are very flavorful in addition to being hot. I think they did an excellent job<br />of retaining flavor, even if they downplayed the spice.<br /><br />If you live on the planet Earth, you're in luck. Cholula is available just about everywhere. I'd honestly<br />like to push for this sauce to become the go-to hot sauce instead of the less flavorful, just-as-spicy<br />Tabasco sauce. This sauce's wooden cap makes it stand out just a bit more than the standard hot sauces<br />gracing the shelves of grocery stores and bodegas. Can be found locally for under $3.<br /><br />Good for pizza, salsas, chicken, steaks, sandwiches...with xanthan gum thickening this sauce, it works<br />really well as a strong alternative to ketchup or mustard without being like either one of those. Very<br />low heat rating so conditioned for most palates. If you are looking for flavor more than spice, this is<br />a great alternative to Louisiana style sauces. I highly recommend it! BTW, after rediscovering this great<br />sauce (after 20 years as a Tabasco snob) I have upgraded this review to .....5 Scovies

review/text: For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Cholula Hot Sauce Original has set itself apart from the others and has become a favorite.  It is not too mild and not too hot and has an exceptional flavor.  I tend to only use Cholula Hot Sauce Original for special occasions since I value it so much.  Also, the bottle's wooden top is aesthetically pleasing.  This is a recommendable hot sauce.

When someone says, "Pain is good", I answer, "No, it ain't."<br /><br />I like hot sauce for the taste.  If I'm watering at the eyes, burning in the mouth and gasping for breath, I'm not tasting diddly.  Peppers have wonderful flavors.  They can be combined in many fine sauces that enhance on those flavors.  Cholula does this well.  This is one of the great hot sauces around.  I'm a hot sauce fanatic.  I love Tabasco, Tapatio, Melinda's, Original Louisiana Hot Sauce, Texas Pete, La Costena, El Yucateco and many, many more.  I cannot pick a favorite.  But Cholula is in that group.

review/summary: Flavorful, balanced and one of the best
review/text: "Hey, just because this is a highly recognized, readily available brand doesn't mean it doesn't deliver the goods" according to Scott Roberts. Who is Scott Roberts? I didn't have a clue until a recent NPR show. It turns out that he is the unofficial head of the chili-heads, the hot sauce movement.<br /><br />On my own, I've been taste testing hot sauces, unaware of Roberts or an entire movement of "chili-heads". I've purchased about 30 hot sauces and began taste testing them - day after day - week after week - writing up notes. (Everyone needs a hobby)<br /><br />What I found is Cholula is one of the best and it is in my top four! BTW: make sure you DON'T purchase one of the Cholula variants that add lime or garlic to the mix - get the "Original". These variants are a bit heavy handed and lack the fine balance of the original sauce.<br /><br />Taste: I'd call this sauce low to medium heat. You'll need a few heavy drops for a Bloody Mary and much more for a family sized dish. But it is not so hot that a few extra drops will ruin a dish. It has a nice blend of tastes, and as noted, has low to medium heat. It has a hint of sweetness and overall this blend is just about perfect. However, unless you have taste tested a number of different hot sauces you may not appreciate how good and well balanced this one is. It simply does its job nicely, adds some heat to a dish without adding any off-tastes. If you have taste tested a number of hot sauces you will detect just a hint of vinegar but no where near the overpowering presence of this stuff which ruins so many other hot sauces (Tabasco, Franks, etc).<br /><br />There are a dizzying array of hot sauces available on the internet but most are difficult to find and expensive to purchase (given shipping costs). This sauce is readily available not just here on Amazon but also in your local grocery store too. That fact alone should encourage you to try it.<br /><br />My three other favorites are: the often recommended Huy Dong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (readily available on Amazon and in stores), El Yucatan Jalapeno Hot Sauce, and Tabasco's Chipotle sauce. The Sriracha is far hotter with subtle garlic notes. The El Yucatan Jalapeno has the freshness of Jalapeno peppers and the Tabasco Chipotle has the concentrated sweet, smoked taste of the Chipotle pepper. These four recommendations really represent a very wide spectrum of hot sauces with fundamentally different tastes - yet - each in their own right - is superior. For about $30.00 why not explore this universe of hot sauces by trying all four.<br /><br />ADVISORY: This sauce does its job quite nicely which is to add some heat to any dish. Does it magically make a mediocre dish better. No! What it does do is add some heat without introducing off -tastes. Now, to many, that may seem to be "a given" but the truth is very few hot sauces actually do that.<br /><br />One last tip - this sauce is sold in a 12 oz and a much larger size and these larger sizes are often the far better buy!<br /><br />And a final word of Warning: Watch out for sellers that get to the top of Amazon's sellers list by offering a low product cost and then make up for this with high shipping charges on a per bottle basis (regardless of how many bottles you order at one time). Check your shipping costs just prior to confirming your order. They may be much higher than you were lead to believe, even if the seller publishes a shipping chart.

review/text: With this sauce, what you get is solid, wonderful flavor. The heat is not important here(even though there's plenty of it for the general population), the flavor is the star of the show.<br /><br />Most foods will mask the hotness, but the flavor complements everything, from wings to pizza to burgers. This is a very, VERY good thing, because you'll want to pour this wonderful substance on EVERYTHING. Do yourself a favor and buy the 12oz bottle, because the 5oz bottle won't last a week.

I can't get enough of this stuff. I put it on omelets, pizza, potato chips, tortilla chips, tacos. It's just that good. If you can get it at Costco, I think you can get two bottles for like 7-9 bucks. Its a bit pricier than other hot sauces but its totally worth it. I haven't tried the other flavors but I might in the near future.

review/summary: Perfect Combination of Flavor and Heat
review/text: I enjoy food that's pretty spicy, I can't say this is the spiciest hot sauce I've ever had (I'd be lying).  It's definitely a medium on the spice scale from high-to-low.  What it does have is flavor though!  It's the perfect blend of Spicy and Flavor, and I've yet to come across another hot sauce that does it better.  I use this on everything I can: Grilled Cheese, Tacos, Eggs, Potatoes, Wings, Pasta, etc.  It works on almost anything you'd normally put hot sauce on, and some things you wouldn't.  If I could describe the flavor I would, but it's unlike anything I've ever tasted before and that's a good thing in this case!<br /><br />All I can say is, do yourself a favor and try it.  The people I've had try it loved it.

review/summary: Ekobrew and Solofill cups are PERFECT for brewing!!
review/text: I did alot of research before buying cups to replace the 'My k-cup' that comes with Keurig.  Their 'My K-cup' did not have enough thought put into it in order to make it a great item...and perhaps they did this so people would continue to purchase single use, throw-away k-cups, rather then using your own ground coffee in your own reusable k-cup!  I researched both the Ekobrew Cup and the Solofill Cup and then bought both and they are BOTH great!  They both take about 2 tablespoons of your own ground coffee which surprised me since the Solofill is overall smaller then the Ekobrew but that is only the design.  If you fill to the line they recommend for maximum...they used the same amount!  And Even though some reviewers said otherwise...they BOTH empty easily.  The Solofill when you fill it with coffee must be held due to it not being flat at the bottom like the Ekobrew.  Unlike the My K-cup from Keurig, these Cups have hinged lids so when you are done brewing and want to empty the grounds, simply turn the cup upside down and tap a couple times on the counter...shake it, open, dump in your recycle/compost bin, rinse the cups for reuse.  Periodically put in dishwasher.<br /><br />For us, we use the tallest setting, 12 oz, and it's perfect strength.  To get a stronger cup, we push 'brew' and once the coffee begins to stream out, we hold up the handle just a little bit so that the coffee stops dripping out...then we wait about 30 seconds or more...so the coffee can brew a bit longer in the water, then we let the handle back down.  The rest of the coffee comes out and it's a bit stronger then if we let it just pour through without the PAUSE.  Everyone has different coffee tastes so it's fun to sample different ounces in your coffee mug.  I actually find i can run a tiny cup following the 12oz cup and thus fill my travel mug to the top...using the same k-cup.  My husband does not do this but I like to put creamer and mocha flavoring in my coffee so having an extra tall cup is plenty strong enough for me.  I also use half regular coffee and half decaf by alternating the 4 - half tablespoons i use... one coffee, one decaf, one coffee, one decaf.  YUM!<br /><br />Ekobrew or Solofill cups....we heartily recommend either of these 'k-cup' replacements for equally great coffee!

review/summary: Ekobrew is awesome.
review/text: I bought this "set" because I brew both tea and coffee in our Keurig. Having a green Ekobrew I could use for tea and a brown one I could use for coffee is perfect. These are light years better than Keurig's My K-cup. So easy to clean and they sit flat. Plus you don't have to pop out the K-cup holder to use them. Just pop'em in like a normal K-cup. Very happy!!!! (Been using a couple months). The peppermint tea is good too.

review/summary: Great cups and tea
review/text: I love the Ekobrew filter cups. They work great with my Keurig brewer, and are easier to use than the Keurig brand reusable filter, which forces you remove the cup holder, and tends to leak. I also find that they are easier to clean than the Solo-fil brand filters. The fact that they help to save me money on the cost of coffee, and give me the ability to chose to use my favorite local coffee brands, are great bonuses. I would highly recommend the Ekobrew filter cups.<br /><br />We haven't tried the tea yet, but we do use Stash brand teas, and enjoy them.

review/summary: MMMM, Yummy
review/text: I just tried these yesterday and they are fantastic.  Tastes just like the Chai Lattes that you get in the restaurants.
