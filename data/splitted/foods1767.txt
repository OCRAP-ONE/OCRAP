review/summary: Very  old stock
review/text: I received this product from Amazon who sent me the oldest stock possible. The postage alone cost about $60 and i ordered about $60 worth of the product. Most of the items I received were only 2 to 3 weeks from their sell by date and are rancid or stale. It was a huge disappointment receiving these and I will never order this product again.Neither will i recommend anyone buy this product from Amazon. It makes you think that Garden of Eatin products are not good but I have bought them before at my local grocery store and they tasted great,so I know for sure that the problem is with Amazon stock. For me, thats $120 wasted as returns are apparently not possible. very very disappointed with Amazon.com, because i shop at Amazon.co.uk very often and have rarely been disappointed and even when there have been disappointments, they are immediately rectified. Amazon.com does not allow refunds or returns on this item, so beware!

review/summary: Jelly Belly's are the Best
review/text: Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!

review/text: This stuff is the real deal--I discovered it in a grocery store deep in Montego Bay.  It's not a hot seasoning though.  Add a scotch bonnet pepper sauce (or, in a pinch, habanero) and you too can make authentic Jamaican meals.  Use it on pork, fish, chicken, in cous cous or rice, it works on almost anything.  It's also not overly salty like some American seasonings (I'm talking to you Zatarain's!  Grace's Jerk Seasoning has about half its sodium).  It's also sweeter than Zatarain's Creole Seasoning.  It does tend to clump at the bottom of the can.

review/text: Used it in a recipe for pulled-pork.  Had never heard of it before and couldn't find it locally.  Ordered it and Himalayan sea salt from Fairies Finest.  I'd procrastinated and was afraid it wouldn't arrive in time, so I called and they promised to get it in the mail right away.  Showed up in 3 days.<br />The salt has undertones of clay, which gives it a deeper flavor and was used as a rub it the recipe.  The liquid smoke overpowered it, but the flavor was there.  I think it best used as a rub or finishing salt.<br />There is also black Hawaiian salt... somehow mixed in with lava!  Have to try that next...<br />P.S.  The salt was well packaged in a jar.

review/summary: Not Maynards, but...
review/text: I was expecting these to taste close to Maynards wine gums, but they simply just don't. That said, they're enjoyable. The pieces are bigger and denser than their Maynards counterpart. The flavors are *as* distinguishable if you don't look at the color before eating, but they're still pretty good.

review/summary: Not too hot...
review/text: After a friend of mine let me try his &quot;Dave's Insanity Sauce&quot;, and I loved the heat kick. Since Dave's can only be purchased on-line, I had a limited choice from my grocery store. I was suprised to see Ass Kickin' Cajun Hot Sauce on the shelf, and from looking at the name I guessed it would be hot. Well, after trying it on a burrito, I can say it is not that hot. And the bottle only lets you put a drop on at a time. I spent more time trying to get hot sauce out than eating. And since it was not as hot as I wanted, I kept putting more and more on tyring to get some heat which lead to another problem- the taste of vinigar was too strong. Too bad, I was looking forward for something really hot. I guess I will have to wait for my internet order to come it. For those of you who eat tobasco, this is better than tobasco and has a little more heat. For those of you who want very hot, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Hard to Resist.
review/text: I love cheddar cheese crackers and Cheez-Its comes immediately to mind. I just can't resist them, so I resist buying them. It works, except I break down every now and then. I've enjoyed them ever since I was a kid back in the fifties. More recently, my four-year-old boy was introduced to Gold Fish by the grandparents and he simply loves them, especially the colored variety. I can't get through the grocery store without picking up a bag. Well, Gold Fish are quite good, but, in my opinion, they don't mark up to Cheez-Its.<br /><br />Recently, when visiting a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market, I spotted another item. It was Annie's Homegrown Organic Cheddar Snack Mix in a 5-ounce box. The mix was partly small cheese crackers in the shape of bunnies and partly small salted pretzels. Very nice and tasty. They have a distinct taste which is provided by some type of seasoned salt. Very good. I'd say the crackers are more like Gold Fish than Cheez-Its, and I'd say that the Cheez-Its are better, but these are quite good. The pretzels add a bit, of course, so I'm going to have to find a box of crackers-only to make a true comparison. I haven't tried them out on my little boy as yet because when I opened the box, I just finished them all off. Well, that's my experience with cheddar-cheese crackers.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: This is good, but I've found that it's much cheaper to purchase from companies that offer larger quantities.  That's why I gave it only 3 stars.<br /><br />Keep checking Amazon's listings for a 2.25 lb container if you use it a lot.  I don't eat gluten, and do use quite a bit of egg white powder (aka powdered egg whites) in baking and cooking.  Practically all the baking recipes call for powdered egg whites and some in addition to whole eggs as well!  Plus you can use it in icings and other things.

All I found was a freezer pack! What a ripoff. When I asked about the high shipping, the response was fairly snotty. When we received the product, we found it labeled "specially selected for Wegman's." Sure enough, next time we went, there it was. In addition, two of the containers had an expiration in two weeks! All in all, the shipping costs make this a big ripoff. Get it at Wegman's.

review/text: I'm a devoted hazelnut lover. This stuff is basically the hazelnut analog of sweetened natural roasted creamy peanut butter. It does require a lot of stirring because the oil separates out from the solids. It's so good that you might just dig in with a spoon and eat it right out of the can, which is exactly what I did when I first tried it. Add some cocoa powder and vanilla extract and a tiny dash of salt to it, and you've got instant Nutella. It's also a great addition to chocolate ganache.

I was a little skeptical that these beans would provide anything over and above regular chickpeas but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  Smaller than most chickpeas you would find in the canned vegetable aisle, these chickpeas are salty and a perfect accompaniment to a salad.  I also include them as a side when I make Indian inspired meals.  I would recommend this product as well as other Jyoti offerings.

review/summary: An old favorite super-sized.
review/text: A frantic search for one of my favorite spices ended here at Amazon. Years ago, you could buy the small (3.87 oz) jar of McCormick's Broiled Steak Seasoning Salt. Sadly, it has disappeared from the stores. This army-sized container is all that's left now.<br /><br />The 1st reviewer mentioned that this is the same as the new 'Perfect Pinch Steak Seasoning'. But there is a minor difference. This large size is what most restaurants use and is basically the same as the old 'Broiled Steak Seasoning Salt', because it still contains MSG, the Perfect Pinch does not, says so right on the label although Amazon has it listed as an ingredient. So the flavor is slightly different. The spices seem more intense with the MSG. I do understand some folks have an allergy to MSG or avoid it due to health concerns, but if you're looking for a blend that's like the old broiled steak seasoning, this one's for you, not the 'Perfect Pinch'. I've used both, and they're both excellent, although my preference is obvious. The Perfect Pinch has more of a pronounced celery flavor.

But it's the same recipe, for sure.<br /><br />This stuff is great - about a third of the things I eat (meats and veggi too) taste better with this added.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Perfect Pinch = Perfect for the trash. A shame that McCormick only see's fit to sell the good stuff in this giant form factor. I'm pretty sure this is a lifetime (X2?) supply - either that or it will go bad before I finish it. I'm keeping it in a cool, dark place and refilling my smaller containers in the kitchen as needed.<br /><br />At least MSG isn't banned (yet!).

review/summary: What the product "used" to be in the small bottles
review/text: I was very disappointed when McCormick changed their formulas and removed the MSG. Outside of the debate on the MSG itself, the new formulas did NOT taste as good. Not as much this steak one but their "original chicken" became not much more than onion salt. Well......for the old recipe lovers this one is it! So I buy these now and refill my smaller bottles. For the chicken one I actually had to buy my own MSG and mix that with the seasoning and some other spcies to get as close to the old blend as I can...because the new ones sucked. And they still do - this one is the old school recipe and its good.

review/summary: McCormick Steak Season
review/text: As with the other reviewers, I have used the Broiled Steak Seasoning for years and when I ran out, I noticed I couldn't find it anywhere.  Nothing compares to Broiled Steak Seasoning, so I turned to Amazon.  I ordered these massive bottles and gave one to my mother.  We made some Porterhouse steaks and it is exactly as I remember...mmmm.  Now I have to figure out how to keep such a big bottle of seasoning from getting old and stale before its all gone which will probably take years!

review/summary: This is the "good stuff" with  MSG...
review/text: I used to get McCormick broiled steak seasoning at the grocery store in the small(3oz.) bottle, but they replaced it with this stuff called "perfect pinch" steak seasoning (no MSG, and has a celery seed flavoring)that is not as good in my opinion. This original steak seasoning has MSG, which I think is what gives it that extra kick and makes it taste so good. The price is good for the amount of seasoning you get (2 huge bottles). I am glad to have found it here on Amazon, since the stores no longer sells it. Its good stuff and I highly recommend it.

review/text: I've been hunting at every grocery store for this stuff for several months, and didn't figure out why I couldn't find it until now. Discontinued? What? My mom used this stuff my entire life--it is my favorite all-purpose seasoning salt. Nothing tastes the same on meats, and I've tried TONS of things while on my quest. Well, I never pictured myself buying 25 dollars' worth of steak seasoning, but I just did. I don't want to ever be without it again.

review/summary: Steak Seasoning at it's best !
review/text: This Steak Seasoning is excellent . I have been using it for 5 years now . Yes the smaller version of it which was broiled steak has seemed to fade out at SuperMarket's across the USA . Thank God for our friends at amazon.com they still sell the bigger version of the product as McCormick Steak Seasoning . Only thing bad i have to say about this product is if you use too much of it expect your steak to be salty so therefore be carefull and don't over season . Here's a recipe for all you guys , don't worry it's simple . Grab a Porterhouse Steak dust both sides with the Steak Seasoning then again dust both sides with black pepper . Then make Your own Garlic butter or Garlic Margerine whatever you prefer . Take your butter or margering whip it in a bowl grab fresh garlic or chopped garlic in oil that they sell in plastic bottles . then mix those two together , last your going to get some green chives chop them up and add some chives to your garlic butter then mix again. Now this butter you just made your gonna take it and put it on each side of that steak while it is grilling . Finally when it's done put that bad boy on a plate and serve it with a grilled or baked loaded potato and grilled corn . For a topping for the steak you can use Steak sauce i prefer Heinz 57 . You guys enjoy hope you guys like it .

review/text: I was using an original McCormicks Grilled Steak Seasoning that had been in storage for the last 2 years. Almost used up, I was anxious to get some more of the good stuff. Could not find it in stores but I found this on Amazon. Needless to say I jumped at the chance to get a "lifetime supply". Received it very quickly, but was very disappointed in the side by side tasting with the original. IMO, don' t waste your money like did. Disappointed, I'll try Costco's Kirkland brand next.

review/summary: This salt will change your life
review/text: Those searching high and low for salt that will change their life can end their journey with Murray River Sea Salt.<br /><br />I first stumbled on this salt at a local outlet of a cultlike nationwide chain store that pretends to sell only the highest quality foods but also happily lends its imprimatur to made-in-China foods that sometimes turn out to be tainted.  But, ignoring other controversies associated with that store, one day a package of this salt sold by that store stirred my interest which led to the salt completing the last step of its long and probably ecologically-unsound trip from Australia to my kitchen.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Murray River salt:  Its pinkish flakes are fragile and crumble easily in your fingers.  It also seems to dissolve almost immediately on contact with food.  This is in sharp contrast to every other salt I've tried.  We currently have 6 or 8 other kinds of coarse-crystal salt in the house.  None of them can be crushed in your fingers.  They remain large, hard chunks of salt.  Yes, they represent other flavors than the Murray River salt, but there is something gentle and friendly about this salt.  I have a totally-unsubstantiated theory that this salt is better for your body than the hardened crystals of other salts.<br /><br />Our household keeps Murray River salt in a salt cellar (in our case a small lidded wooden bowl) from which it is pinched with the fingers (instead of using the traditional tiny spoon) and crumbled directly onto food on the plate.  For sanitary reasons, only a small amount of the salt at a time is put in the bowl.  That way the bowl gets cleaned frequently.  Frequent cleaning seems like a necessity when fingers, even washed ones, are the tools of choice for dispensing the salt.  Words to the wise: If you invite nose-pickers to your table, provide a salt shaker and hide the Murray River stuff till they've left.  If you have small children in your home, wait until they are grown and are draining your bank account at the safe distance of some far-off college before purchasing and placing this salt on your table.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that they use this as a finishing salt.  Our household concurs.  We rarely if ever add this salt to anything in the cooking process.  We keep Kosher salt and a couple of sea salts for most larger-salt-use cooking needs, like baking (which frankly seems like the only time one should add much salt to the cooking process).  But this is the good stuff for your table and the food you serve on it.<br /><br />The chain store mentioned above no longer carries this salt so Amazon is the logical alternative.<br /><br />Note that I purchased a 1lb bag, which keeps well because I live in a desert.  But next time I'll probably purchase a multi-pack of the smallest bags for a small amount more per unit weight in exchange for the convenience of having smaller packages.

review/text: If you like marinated artichokes, you will love the grilled, marinated artichokes.  I combine the grilled artichokes with their oil, Reese's pickled baby corn drained, rinsed & rough chop, chopped yellow bell pepper, chopped green onions, toasted pine nuts, 1/2 pound cooked-drained-rinsed fusilli or penne pasta and a very small amount of soft goat cheese for a beautiful, unique anytime pasta salad.  I have lemon olive oil that I sparingly sprinkle over the drained pasta for extra flavor.  The grilled artichokes are hard to find for some reason.  I was happy to find them by the case online...and for a fair price.  Try these, you will be pleasantly surprised.  These will become your "secret" ingredient!

review/summary: False advertising of the base, a mess to clean up after shipping, no instructions
review/text: This was a gift sent to my elderly mother to brighten up her retirement home room. First, the base shown in the picture is not the one provided to the customer. Look at the other customer photos and you will see that what is provided is much thinner and less robust. This was the base that was delivered to my mother, while I expected her to get what I saw in the vendor photo. Second, we still haven't identified the material used to pack the plant, but it appears to be some form of micro bead that arrived somewhat damp and sticks to everything. Finally, there were no set up or care instructions provided with the plant. My mother didn't know whether to use rocks or soil, how full to fill the base, etc. Only after many long distance phone calls between us and me searching the internet for the proper care procedures for this type of plant, we were finally able to get it in the proper material and in the base. Way too much work for an inexperienced user. The plant itself had a few yellowing leaves upon arrival, but now that it is in the base, it is thriving.

review/text: I have been wanting a bamboo plant for my house for quite some time, and I decided after reading the reviews, that I would purchase this one from 9GreenBox. I really liked the looks of the picture on here before I purchased, and hoped it would look the same when it arrived at my house. Indeed, it looks even better in person than from the picture! I could not believe how healthy and beautiful the bamboo was. I expected to see a little damage from the shipping, but the bamboo I received looked like one had just pulled it out of a forest where it grows naturally! I don't see one flaw in my plant, therefore I would highly recommend purchasing this product from them!!!<br /><br />The only thing that I feel could be improved, could be that the clear vase in the center that holds the bamboo, could have been glass instead of a thin plastic vase. But, for the price of this product, it really doesn't matter if it is plastic after all!!!

review/summary: Listing Price of $59.99 is deceiving.
review/text: Bought the item thru 9GreenBox and arrived on time and in good condition. This item has a nice, modern look to it. However, the vase and plant looks smaller than what the picture potrays. After having visited my local Ralphs, I found that these bamboo plants are sold at $3.99 and are bigger and more mature than the one sold by 9GreenBox. As price comparison, if Ralphs has the plant at $3.99 that would leave the vase at around $10 from this seller, which is a little steep in my opinion. Throw in a shipping charge of $6.99 that sums up to a total of about $21 and you have yourself an overpriced item; hence, cost you more than if you were just to buy the Ralphs plant and find a cheaper vase alternative.  As for the listing price of $59.99, that is just absurd.
