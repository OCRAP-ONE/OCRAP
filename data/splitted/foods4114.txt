review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: I never buy flavored coffee.  I'm a cream, sugar and drizzle of caramel sauce type of coffee drinker.  When I read the reviews about this toffee flavored coffee I decided to try it with high hopes.<br /><br />As the coffee was brewing into the mug, I smelled a slight toffee scent.  It, and the coffee smelled good.  My hubs wanted a cup, just black.  I brought him his and after he drank some, while I was brewing mine, I asked him how he liked the flavor.  "What flavor?" he asked.  "It tastes like coffee to me" he said.  More questions to him and he said all he tasted was coffee, no flavor and the coffee was ok.<br /><br />Now for my cup.  I used about 1 inch of milk, one spoon of sugar and the Keurig on medium brewing setting.  The same faint scent of toffee was there along with the coffee.  I took my first sip and hardly tasted any toffee flavor.  I looked at the k-cup and it said 'toffee' on it so it was the correct k-cups that were sent.  It is such a mild, almost non-existent flavor that I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to those who don't like flavored coffee, I'm sure they would like it.  I'm disappointed in the weak flavor of toffee but the coffee itself is good tasting so it's not a waste.  I'm used to extra-bold, dark/french roasts so this is a much lighter roast for me.  All in all I like it.

review/text: Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee K-Cups are the best flavor of all the K-Cups that I've tried.  I tried Emeril's, Paul Newman's, and several other brands, but Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee flavor is absolutely my favorite.  It's not too strong nor too weak and while it's brewing, it makes the whole house smell good.

review/text: I recently started drinking flavored coffees, since I preferred regular to hazelnut and french vanilla.  This coffee changed that. This coffee has a rich flavor and tastes great.  I have started keeping a supply on hand, and have had black coffee drinkers try this, and so far they have all said this is the only flavored coffee that they thought tasted good.  Try it you won't be disappointed.

review/text: I made the mistake of buying a 50 pack of these k cups when they were on sale. The first few were decent, but the more I drank them, the more I started to dislike the flavor. At this point, I'm pretty much forcing myself to get through them since I don't want to waste them. The best way I can describe the flavor is a mixture of watered down coffee and old, stale butterscotch candy. Ugh.

I was a bit worried because the GJ Mudslide was a slight disappointment.<br /><br />Butter Toffee is smooth with just the right amount of sweetness  The butter toffee flavor was distinct and at the perfect depth of flavor.<br /><br />This might be my new first choice in coffee!

review/text: I tried this based on the great customer reviews.  I use the Keurig at work (we have one that everyone shares - you just need to bring in your own K-Cups).  The aroma is fantastic, but the actual flavor is just okay. We typically run it through twice using the small cup setting, so it gives us a full large cup.  Maybe this is better if you just run it through one time and make a short cup.  I thought maybe it was just me, so I gave it to a friend who also loves flavored coffee.  He tried it and was not very excited either.  It is certainly a personal preference with regard to flavor.

review/summary: Try it with Caramel Macchiato cream!
review/text: To ensure that I don't waste your time, I want to begin this review by letting you know just what kind of coffee drinker I am. I drink coffee every day, sometimes up to 4 cups a day, depending on my mood. When I have coffee I use just a little sugar but a good bit of cream, usually flavored. International Delight French Vanilla has always been my old faithful, go-to creamer.<br /><br />I recently received a Keurig Cup Coffee Brewer and drank the Dark Magic K-Cups that were gifted with it. I found the Dark Magic to be very rich, a little over-roasted, but very drinkable. After running through the 24 pack I was looking for something different.<br /><br />I decided on the Butter Toffee K-Cup by Gloria Jean and was pleasantly surprised by the full, rich flavor delivered without any bitter aftertaste. The Butter Toffee is a medium roast blend with a very nice toffee flavor.<br /><br />Now on to my little recommendation. I was in Wally World the other day and was going to pick up some more French Vanilla cream when something different caught my eye. Coffeehouse Inspirations - Caramel Macchiato by International Delight. (Just so you know, this was the dairy based version, not the non-dairy shelf-stable individual portions.) I was rather impatient during the drive home to say the least. Let me describe the experience with a formula.<br /><br />Butter Toffee K-Cup + International Delight Caramel Macchiato = An amazing cup of coffee.<br /><br />While I'm not going to say that I've never had a cup of coffee this good, I cannot recall one off the top of my head. Try it!

review/summary: Best brown sugar ever
review/text: The color of this brown sugar is about a shade darker than regular dark brown sugar. The flavor is a bit different from brown sugar in that it seems richer, more complex, and more delicious. I used this in a baked beans recipe and it is by far the best version of baked beans I've ever made. It's also delicious in chocolate chip cookies. I have not tried the dark brown muscovado since this seems absolutely perfect for all my brown sugar needs.

review/summary: Variety, with 25% Cocoas and 75% Chocolate Coffees
review/text: Got this order today.  Comes in a cardboard box that is utilitarian, but not something you'd want to keep out in view on the kitchen countertop and take K-cups out of.  The selection did not have quite as much cocoa as I expected, but there's no denying it is ALL chocolate.  Contents included 35 cups total; detailed inventory below:<br /><br /> Timothy's:  German Chocolate Cake (4 K-cups)<br /> Timothy's:  Mocha Java (4)<br /> Timothy's:  White Hot Chocolate (4)<br /> Gloria Jean's:  Swiss Chocolate Almond (5)<br /> Gloria Jean's:  Mudslide (4)<br /> Green Mountain:  Mocha Nut Fudge (4)<br /> Green Mountain:  Hot Cocoa (5)<br /> Donut House Collection:  Chocolate Glazed Donut (5)<br /><br />Of these, the Hot Cocoa and the White Hot Chocolate were cocoa varieties, 9 cups in all, and the rest were coffee selections.  There are hundreds of quite detailed reviews of each cup variety on Keurig's website, keurig.com, so there isn't much point in rehashing flavors and opinions here.<br /><br /> There was also a rolled up print in a cardboard tube.  It is B&W with a black ink rendering of two birds and a mound of coffee beans rising up like an anthill between them.  The print is on glossy white paper and is 17" x 10".  I guess you could put it in a frame and hang it in the kitchen; it would match the average American kitchen decor of white/black applicances.  I am actually considering doing so only because I have no other pictures hanging in my kitchen.<br /> Am not a fan of flavored coffees (I like black, extra-bold coffee).  But, I admit I brewed some Mudslide and enjoyed it for a change.  Got the selection for the cocoa, which is enjoyed by my friend who prefers "cocoa that isn't TOO chocolately"-- she loves it.  Others will find it not chocolate-y enough.<br /> The other plus in ordering this selection is that the company, Crazy Cups, is an affiliate of Amazon, and delivers VERY quickly.  Had my coffee/cocoa in 2 days and couldn't be more pleased about that!  You can get the free "super saver shipping", which is what I did, and the cost of each cup works out to approx $0.83.  You can get cheaper deals if you search the internet, but it will be difficult to find a variety pack with this much variety for this price.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Very fine variety, (not a taster's review)
review/text: This is not a review of the coffee flavors, since I have not yet sampled them all. This is a review of the product as a whole.<br />I believe this to be a very satisfactory sampler of coffees with chocolate flavorings, or hot chocolates. I recieved 9 different flavors, 4 kcups of 8 flavors and 3 kcups of 1. I hesitate to record the flavors I recieved, since they may vary from another's shipment. However, I am pleased with the selection, and to satisfy one's curiosity I will list them here.<br />3 of Green Mountain 'Mocha Nut Fudge'<br />4 each of:<br />Timothy's 'Mocha Java', 'German Chocolate Cake', & 'White Hot Chocolate'<br />Gloria Jeans 'Mudslide' & 'Swiss Chocolate Almond'<br />Green Mountain 'Hot Cocoa'<br />Donut House 'Chocolate Glazed Donut'<br />Van Houtte 'Belgian Chocolate<br />It bears repeating, this variety may differ from what another one recieves.<br />Packaging was adequit for delivery, a plain white box, but not for display or information. (for example, how many calories etc.)<br />The print I recieved is not the one described on the product page. (Perhaps they are all gone?) It is fairly attractive, a 'cat' of coffee beans with some colour, but not the hill of beans with the birds as shown on the product page.<br />I would reccomend this variety pack to someone who would like to sample the chocolate offerings without having to splurge on an entire pack of one flavor at a time.

review/summary: It Sure Ain't Chocolate
review/text: My wife and 15 year-old daughter don't drink coffee and are envious of my access to fresh coffee in my Keurig, one-cup-at a-time machine..  They do, however, love hot chocolate/hot cocoa.  The three of us were trying to decide which of many available boxes of Keurig compatible hot chocolate to order.  None seemed to have universally positive reviews, and most cost about a dollar per K-cup, which seems expensive for one home made mug.  We didn't want to make a mistake and buy 16, 32, or more, of a brand or type they didn't like.<br /><br />Voila!  Someone thoughtfully put nine varieties of hot chocolate in one box,  The "Keurig K-Cups Chocolate Lovers Sampler Pack + Limited Edition Print." Plus, it included thirty-five cups of hot chocolate, and for under a dollar a cup.<br /><br />The Chocolate Lovers Sampler Pack arrived yesterday.  Tonight, the three of us enthusiastically ripped into the box containing nine different versions of hot chocolate/hot cocoa.  We even moved the Keurig machine from the kitchen to the family room for easier access as we watched TV and simultaneously  engaged in a chocolate lovers orgy, an orgy which I agreed to join.  Following a directive from my daughter, I made a special run to buy marshmellows.<br /><br />If we each had three cups of different hot chocolate, and traded sips, we would each have tasted all nine permutations of the Chocolate Lover's Sampler Pack, and know which of the nine were our favorites.<br /><br />My first cup was, ah... dissappointing.  It tasted a little like coffee, not hot chocolate, but was so weak I couldn't be sure.  My wife and daughter, were soon, "yucking" with disgust.  They both hate coffee, and I joined them in my evaluation of this coffee.  We tried container after container, and the result was repeated, over and over.  The K-cups fell into one of two categories:  weak bad coffee; or weaker bad coffee.  I couldn't discern more nuance than that.  I tried making a cup setting the water quantity for a tea cup.  Nope.  Still too weak.  (And I have many Keurig coffee's that I love.  They often have the word "bold" in the title, and I apparently do like strong coffee.  I'm not saying everyone will dislike these particular K-cups, only that I sure did, and doubly so since we had ordered a Sampler Pack of hot chocolate and hot cocoa.<br /><br />Finally, my daughter found one Green Mountain Hot Chocolate, and it was pretty good, but watery.  She found another and after reducing the water quantity down to the tea cup size, with a couple of marshmellows tossed in, that one cup was good.  One cup of hot chocolate out of 35 cups.  Some chocolate lover's orgy. :-(<br /><br />I considered the possibility that perhaps I'm partially to blame.  Maybe the item description said that this was really weak, bad coffee, and not hot chocolate at all.<br /><br />But the Chocolate Lover's Sampler is the 11th hit in a search of the, "Grocery and Gourmet Food," category using, "Keurig hot chocolate," as the search phrase.  There are 24 items on this first page alone, and three additional pages of hits follow.  Hit number 21, for example, is, "Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa Milk Chocolate, 12-Count K-Cups."  The Chocolate Lover's Sampler is surrounded by Hot Chocolate.<br /><br />I've been buying items from Amazon since they were just a little stream, with some interesting rapids, not unlike the nearby Chatooga River which marks the Georgia/South Carolina border, and where the movie, "Deliverance," was filmed.  In all that time I have never given an item one star.  I usually only write reviews if I have had a five star experience.  So I gave it two, although one (1) would have been fully justified.<br /><br />Now, how do I get my money back, or a credit on some real hot chocolate?<br /><br />UPDATE:  THREE DAYS LATER.  Yesterday I explained our experience on the official feedback form, and referenced this review for more detail.  I asked for a refund of 5/6s of the purchase price.  This morning, less than 24 hours after describing my experience, this amount had been credited to my credit card.  While it's debatable whether this product deserves a rating as low as two stars based on the fact it doesn't contain the product I thought I was getting - it could be perfect for someone who wants a variety of flavored coffees - IMO, one thing is not debatable:<br /><br />Amazon's customer service is five stars, plus, and I offer that evaluation based on over a hundred purchases, ranging from a $5 HDMI cable, to a $34,027 Volvo XC Station Wagon*, stickered at $40,650.  And, I was able to avoid almost $2,400 in sales tax.  But get this, the young man who delivered this beauty insisted on washing it in my driveway, and refused to accept even a modest tip.  I hope this doesn't get him fired, but he did accept a freshly brewed, delicious cup of Keurig coffee (I had one, too) made with the Parisian Extra-Bold Dark Magic K-cup.)*<br /><br />* Just kidding.  I've purchased some expensive items but no car.  Yet.  But I'm not kidding about Amazon service:  Five Stars.

review/summary: Too much cocoa for us...
review/text: I purchased this under the guise that the assortment would be similar to the most helpful review listed (25% cocoa / 75% coffee).  Instead, here are the small handful of flavors received:<br /><br />6 Grove Square Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa<br />6 Grove Square Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa<br />3 Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa<br />6 Cafe Escapes Dark Choclate Hot Cocoa<br />7 Green Mountain Mocha Nut Fudget Coffee<br />7 Gloria Jean's Mudslide Coffee<br /><br />Hence, 60% cocoas and only 40% coffee (albeit only 2 flavors of coffee).  We also did NOT receive the 8 varieties that are listed as a product feature.<br /><br />Yes, the sampler is Chocolate -- which is what we ordered.  It also arrived timely and in a standard cardboard box (no print art included as former reviewer mentioned).<br /><br />Bottom line for me is that this sampler consisted of too much cocoa and not enough coffee variety.

review/text: I've enjoyed most of the Crazy Cups variety boxes but not this one.  Mostly grove square and cafe escapes powdered cocoa, which isnt that good for your brewer as the powder can gum up the nozzles.  Not to mention its pretty easy to put an envelope of cocoa for 20c into a cup, add water and warm it up in the microwave for a minute.  The coffees weren't that exciting either, mostly green mountain.  Needs more variety and less instant cups.

Of the coffees, for the more popular brands, such as the Chocolate Glazed Donut and the Mocha Nut Fudge I had 3-5, with a pair of some other types and a few singletons of some of the more specialty flavors (One was Raspberry Chocolate Truffle).  So as for it being a sampler... it most certainly is that.<br /><br />I have the B-60 model Keurig with 3 cup sizes (~5, 7 and 9 oz) and it seems that for most of the flavor samples I have tried the 5 or 7 oz is ideal, with the 9oz seeming a bit more diluted in flavor.  The cocoas come out well mixed no matter the sizes.

review/text: My sample package came in a small cardboard box, which was opened and then resealed. I had the proper amount of k-cups and nothing was damaged.<br /><br />My package included:<br />7 Mocha Nut Fudge (Green Mountain Coffee)<br />6 Chocolate Glazed Donut (Donut House)<br />6 Mudslide (Gloria Jean's)<br />1 White Chocolate Mint (Van Houtte)<br />5 Cafe Mocha (Cafe Express)<br />5 Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa (Cafe Express)<br />5 Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa (Grove Square)<br /><br />After reading other reviews, it seems every sample package is different. I haven't read about anyone else only getting one k-cup of one flavor, but I'm not complaining.

review/summary: Great Coffee, AWFUL Cocoa!
review/text: I was excited to try a variety of chocolate flavored coffees and cocoas when I purchased this item. Unfortunately, the cocoas have proved underwhelming at best. Weak, tasteless, and undrinkable are a few of the adjectives that best apply. On the other end of the spectrum, the coffees are great! I think Green Mountain and other brewers need to figure out a way to make rich, creamy, and most of all, CHOCOLATELY hot cocoa.

review/summary: For flavored coffee lovers, not hot chocolate lovers
review/text: I purchased this thinking that all the flavors would be some version of hot chocolate; what I ended up with was two types of actual sweet chocolate: one hot chocolate, one white chocolate.  All the rest are flavored coffee blends.  I'm sure that folks who like chocolate-flavored coffee will enjoy this (friends at work who've tried some of the flavors like them), but I'm a dark-roast, no flavors, sugar or milk coffee lover, so this just wasn't for me.  It wasn't bad, just not what I was looking for.  The "limited edition print" wasn't exactly the draw, either, but I appreciate the interest in putting in someone's art.

review/summary: Interesting Change of Pace
review/text: It's hard for me to describe the taste of plantain chips. They don't taste like bananas, and as tempted as I am to say so, they don't taste like chicken. It's a subdued, mild taste that's pleasant but doesn't explode in one's mouth with any intensity. I bought these on a whim to try since I'd never had a bag of plantain chips before.<br /><br />The crispy crunchness reminds me of potato chips without the oiliness or similar taste. While munching on a handful of plantain chips, I wondered how they compared to potato chips so I hopped on the Google train and did a little exploring.<br /><br />Per one ounce serving the Chifles plantain chips have 170 calories, 8 grams of total fat, and 30mg of sodium.<br /><br />On the Calorie King web site I learned that on average potato chips per ounce have 155 calories, 10.6 grams of fat, and 149 mg of sodium. According to several sites potato chips actually contain more potassium than plantain chips do. A serving of plantain chips holds 206mg of potassium.<br /><br />We just happen to have a bag of Utz Baked Ripple Chips in the house for more comparison. These chips per one ounce serving have 110 calories, 1.5g of fat, and 130mg of sodium. There's no mention on the bag about potassium content.<br /><br />I'd certainly recommend trying plantain chips for a change of pace. On my bag of Chifles plantain chips is a statement that these are certified WBEN. (womens business enterprise)

review/summary: Deliciously addictive treat
review/text: For anyone who is curious about plantains, it is a tropical product.  It is in the family of bananas, however, unlike eating a ripened banana, plantains must be cooked, whether in the green or yellow skin.  Plantains are used in many delicious dishes, however, as a snack, fried plantains are an absolute delight!  The taste is unlike that of potato chips, so if you are thinking it will be along the same taste, it is a big no.  Try them with an open mind, and hopefully you will come to enjoy this delicious treat as much as I do.<br /><br />Chifles are very delicious on its own or paired with your favorite salsa or guacamole or whatever dip is your choice.  Personally, I eat them as is; on the go.  I am so addicted to these chips I usually buy them in bulk whenever I find them in the stores.<br /><br />Amazon, congratulations on your customer service award!!  Your customer service team training modules should be used as a model for all other businesses.  You are truly outstanding in this area, and for your amazon customers, we appreciate this so very much.  I have NEVER been disappointed with you yet.... :-) ( don't think I will either..)

review/text: This is a superb product!!  Healthy, unlike white sugar.<br /><br />A fine powdered white sugar can be made from Turbinado simply by 'whizzing' in a food processor or blender.<br /><br />A truly unique syrup may be made by combining 1 Cup Turbinado and one cup water, bring to a boil for one minute, add 1 tsp of Arrowroot powder with a whisp, boil gently for 2-3 minutes, add 1 tsp each of Pure Vanilla and Maple flavoring, remove from heat and refrigerate when cooled.

review/text: This is my favorite sugar to bake with. I give a little sprinkle of this to the tops of my cookies and they come out with the perfect amount of sweetness and crunch. This sugar takes the heat well and does not melt, giving a little sparkle to the cookie tops too. I also like this sugar served just on the side of pancakes. I eat them just like a little kid, tearing off bits and dipping in the sugar which gives such a nice crunch. Demerara sugar is also great for hot beverages like tea.<br /><br />I love that it comes in this fine container which not only looks great on the shelf but seals very tightly to keep out any humidity or critters.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/text: This sugar has a light brown color and delicious aroma. However, the granules are very large, so it is not a good candidate for creaming sugar and butter together. But if you plan to use it in a recipe where the sugar will be melted first, then it's a great product. The large granules are perfect for sprinkling on top of finished baked goods as a decoration. The plastic container it comes in is very handy. This is a wonderful product and would be perfect if only the granules were not so large.

We recently tried another Rogan Josh sauce in a jar, and it didn't compare.

I still think the price was a little high for the amount you receive which is why I only have it 4 stars.

It really does come in a brick and we use a rubber mallet and screw driver to break into it.  I realize there are many ways to do this but we find this way works well for us.

review/summary: Warning - Heavy Carton
review/text: Indian Summer Tart Cherry Juice is delicious.  The eight plastic bottles that each contain 46 oz. makes an extremely heavy box.  When I picked my order up from the mail stop that receives my packages, I was warned NOT to get this product again, because it was heavy for him to deal with.  I had to open the box and take two bottles to my car in four trips, and then I had to dispose of the shipping box as well.  It was problematic for me to find a proper storage place for the eight bottles, but it was a welcome taste treat.  I noticed that the plastic used in the bottles is not recyclable, which is a concern to me.  Although I found the juice to be delicious, I am going to try the concentrate method next, simply because of the weighty product.  I have three ruptured discs in the lumbar curve, and carrying any amount of a heavy product is not recommended at any time.  I, personally, do not find any redeeming quality for joints, but I did notice an immediate increase in the quality of sleep.  I have no trouble falling asleep, but it seemed as if I hardly dreamed for a long time, which would indicate rem sleep. When I began taking the tart cherry juice, I would dream every night, regardless of the time available for sleeping.  I also woke up with my body more refreshed.  The dreaming quality was most noticeable with Trader Joe's Tart Cherry Juice sold in glass bottles.  I did not notice the same quality of dreams using the Indian Summer product.

review/text: You've heard about how those crazy kids in Japan love cucumber-flavored things. They've got cucumber pepsi, kit-kats, and candy. The idea of a fresh cool cucumber drink interests you, so you decide to try it. You wrench open the bottle with your sensitive hands and take a sip. Suddenly you are alone on a cloudy, grey day, on a construction site for a new hospital. The hospital is nearing its completion but is obviously unfinished; blue tarps hang in place of drywall in some areas and fiberglass powder is scattered all over the bare concrete floor. The wind gently blows and the tarps sway, sweeping a cloud of insulation-dust and dirt into your face. It's musty and dry and it makes your mouth feel dirty.<br /><br />That is what drinking dry cucumber soda is like.
