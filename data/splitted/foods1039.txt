review/summary: About the best Earl Grey Tea I've found
review/text: Since I first tasted Stash brand Earl Grey tea, I have not purchased any other brand of Earl Grey.  The other brands I've tried just don't taste as good and are not quite the same.  This tea is flavored with oil of bergamot, rather than just "scented" with it, as as some labels say on other brands of Earl Grey tea.  I'm not sure what the difference is, unless that maybe Stash just uses more of the bergamot in their recipe.  But whatever the difference is, it works!<br /><br />For an added treat, also try the Stash "double bergamot" Earl Grey tea.  I highly recommend both, and I regularly drink both.

review/summary: Bold but not harsh, excellent flavor
review/text: This is my favorite of the wide varieties of teas I have. It has a strong but not harsh, and definitely not a wimpy "herbal tea" excellent flavor for a cup of perfect hot tea.  In the summer I use 3 peach tea, 3 regular black or green tea bags in my ice tea maker for extremely refreshing great flavored ice tea.  Some other teas I have tried are a bit too sweet; not this.  I don't think you could be disappointed in this choice.

review/summary: great peach flavored black tea
review/text: As a previous reviewer stated,this tea is a wonderful balance of peach flavor and black tea.I am a traditional tea drinker and could never tolerate those 'fruitty' herbal teas as they are not really tea at all. But this Stash peach tea has a strong black tea base and just a hint of genuine peach flavor.In the summer I always brew 2 or 3 black and Darjeeling tea bags with one peach tea bag and the end result is superb iced tea.I highly recommend this product

review/summary: An enjoyable way to start the day
review/text: I drank the regular strength Stash Chai for more than a year, and I liked it very much, although I always found myself wishing for a spicier version. When I learned that Stash also makes a Double Spice Chai I picked up a box of it at a local coffee/tea shop and decided it was actually closer to my preferences. When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it.

review/summary: it's got double the spice, but. . .
review/text: the tea itself doesn't seem hearty enough to stand up to the spices. What I mean is that even after waiting the right amount of time for my cup to finish steeping, I have a cup of chai that's spicy but not really strong enough for me. I don't like stuff toxic; that's not the problem. I think perhaps this tea is just not meant to be very strong.<br /><br />It's got a great level of spiciness, however, and it smells wonderful as it's brewing.<br /><br />Stash Company--how about just a titch more black tea in each bag? :-)

review/summary: Very good orange spice tea.
review/text: I just tried orange spice tea for the first time on a recent trip to Hawaii, and they had a tea chest of varoius Stash teas in the lobby for people to try. So I deceded to try a flavor I had never had before and I was pleasantly surprised. Now orange spice tea will always remind me of Hawaii. I bought a box of Bigelow Constant Comment, which is another orange spice tea, but it wasn't as good as Stash's, im my opinion. Stash has much more flavor, and isn't that the point?

review/summary: Steeping - the longer the better
review/text: This tea is delicious with milk. The description on the website says to brew for 3-5 minutes. While this is a normal instruction for black tea, it will not produce the best chai. Because chai contains lots of spices, like other spicy things, it is better if the spices have the opportunity to mellow out. Basically, the longer you leave it, the better it gets. You can leave it over night or as long as you want. If it is cold, just put it in the microwave or reheat on the stove to bring it up to your preferred temperature.<br /><br />The decaf version with milk makes a lovely bedtime drink.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG8M6">Stash Decaf Chai Spice Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

I bought another box and the second I opened the first packet I could smell that they had changed the recipe. Checking the back of the two boxes confirmed it. Cinnamon is about all I taste when I drink it, although the aftertaste has a hint of clove. Pretty expensive for something that tastes mixed by a child.

It tasted great  as the mushroom sauce was rich and creamy with small pieces of mushroom that weren't overwhelming. It blended easily and one can was enough for the casserole I prepared. I will definitely use this sauce again and cannot wait to try other flavors!

review/text: While the product was as expected as I had ordered it before in smaller packaged quantities, the larger volume bag ordered arrived in an Amazon box opened and out of the sack.  The contents were spilling out of the carton even as I picked it up and loaded it unto my car.  I left a little trail of kibbles as I finally arrived home.  That was my only complaint and as I did not think the product itself was compromised I simply kept it rather than go through the process of returning the item.  My dogs of course love it so, the cost is much better than purchasing from the pet store and the convenience of having it shipped to my PO box is nice.  Next time though perhaps I should have it delivered to my home residence. Will definitely order again but will probably order in smaller bags so as to avoid the "opened" bag experience.

review/text: I only tried this tea because it was provided free at my hotel in Oregon. That was a few years ago and I have been drinking this tasty tea ever since. You can add sugar if you want and it's good, but what I really love about this tea is that it is delicious with nothing added. Nothing's needed. Tea bag, hot water, steep, done, drink. Great for travel. Just stash some tea bags in your purse or pocket and if you have access to hot water you can have tea in an instant. I make this tea at work, too. Actually, I drink it all day long and never tire of the fresh berry taste.

Instant licorice flavor.  If you're not familiar with Stash's teas, then be sure to give this one a try.  They have wonderful, rich flavored teas, not too strong or too weak.  They come in a zillion varieties and all just equally as good.  Sign up for auto delivery on this one - you'll be back for more.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Why is this tea not famous and widely available?
review/text: You used to be able to find Stash Licorice at major grocery stores, and I'm baffled as to why it has disappeared from shelves and can only be found online. It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners. The aroma is heavenly and as an added bonus, it acts as an appetite suppressant (at least for me) because when you're inhaling that scent your palate doesn't crave anything else. Great as an after-dinner/before-bed drink.

review/summary: Licorice lovers and health nuts, this is for you!
review/text: If you love black licorice and and would like something that also has great health benefits, you'll love this tea.  I brew this tea and drink hot, but even when it gets cold, its still great.  I often just add more cold water to it and get a very mild licorice taste that is better than just strait water.  I will do this several times until I just want more of the licorice taste, and brew some more tea.  As to the health benefits, there are many.  Here are just a few: "useful for many ailments including asthma, body odor, bursitis, canker sores, chronic fatigue, depression, colds and flu, coughs, gingivitis and tooth decay, gout, heartburn, HIV, viral infections, fungal infections, ulcers, liver problems, Lyme disease, menopause, psoriasis, shingles, sore throat, tendinitis, tuberculosis, ulcers, yeast infections, prostate enlargement and arthritis."  See [...] and click on the link licorice.  That is where this health info came from, but there is much much more info there on that web site too.  It's said to be very good for flu and colds, which I'm fighting now, and it's so very SOOTHING to my throat!  You'll love this tea.

review/summary: A loyal drinker (!) for years
review/text: Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well.  Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some).  The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea.  It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect "unwinding" drink before bedtime.  Not "spicy" in the classic sense at all, either.  I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea.

review/text: I love the taste of this tea. It tastes exactly like licorice root and it's very refreshing. I like to make iced tea with it. However, I just read a review someone made on another licorice tea product on amazon, telling their story of licorice toxicity. I'm a fairly paranoid person, so I'm now only going to enjoy this tea about twice a week, instead of everyday like I was doing. I canceled my subscribe & save order because I don't think I can safely use up 6 boxes within the time I selected. I might be overreacting, I probably am, but better safe than sorry.

review/summary: Amazing tea!!
review/text: I will be honest and say that when a friend suggested I try this tea as I began getting sick last winter, I told her no way because I do not like licorice flavor.  She still made me a cup and I was stunned.  This is the best tea EVER!  I stopped drinking coffee during the winter and drank this tea all day long.  The students in my class noticed my new love of this tea and bought me a package as a gift.  The flavor is fabulous and I really like the fact that I do not need to add any sweetener at all.  The aftertaste is so interesting.  I have never had anything like it.<br /><br />I prepared this as a cold tea this summer, but it just didn't taste the same.  I will stick with it as a hot tea only.  Did I mention that I love it?

review/summary: Love this when I'm sick
review/text: This tea is super gingery, and lemony, and I just love it with honey when I'm sick. Love it. My local grocery is out, so here I am on Amazon, buying more.<br /><br />Note that the primary source of "lemon" appears to be lemongrass. (Ingredients, via the product packaging: "Ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, and citric acid. Contains: Soy." I don't understand "Contains: Soy", but it's not listed on the ingredients... I wonder if this is an allergy alert thing.)<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients, the organic version has caffeine and doesn't have any actual lemon in it... I haven't tried that one yet, though. I'm a fan of both green tea and organic products, but I don't want caffeine when I'm sick, so I'll stick with this.

review/text: A friend introduced me to Licorice Tea many years ago by asking for a cup at a restuarant. When the server stated that the restuarant did not have Licorice tea, she took a packette out of her handbag and asked for a cup of hot water. She had an extra packette for me to try. WOW, interesting taste, not bitter and no need for sweetner. Stash makes the most robust decafinated tea. Until a short while ago, I was able to puchase the 20 count box of Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea at the local grocery, but Licorice Spice is no longer on the shelf. I placed my order for the Pack of 6 to save on shipping and should now have sufficient tea bags for several months. Individually, foil wrapped tea bags keeps the flavor fresh.

I personally steep the tea for longer than advised on the package but I like my teas strong (package says 3-5 minutes, I go for 10).  I have turned some of my licorice loving friends onto it - 1 is a diabetic and she LOVES it since it gives a really sweet flavor with NO sugar or carbohydrates.  It is wonderful on a cold evening and won't keep you awake as there is NO caffeine.

review/summary: I like this tea!
review/text: Well, what's to be said other than I really like this Licorice Spice Tea?<br /><br />I cut out sugar and reduced my caffeine intake over the last year or so and this licorice tea is my favorite replacement for a caffeinated hot drink. Because I have a sweet tooth I usually now drink tea and coffee with soy milk to reduce the bitterness. This licorice spice tea is delicious and I drink it equally happily both with and without soy milk (the licorice gives it a natural sweet flavor). I have at least one or two cups a day, and even if I was to return to my previous high regime of caffeination I would still include a cup or two of this tea during the day.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of chamomile and this Licorice spice tea does not seem to list that as an ingredient.<br /><br />It seems many people don't like the flavor of licorice, but those that do really like this tea.<br /><br />I've found that the flavor of each batch seems to vary in intensity and the last batch I bought had a less strong taste which simply means it needs to be steeped a little longer.<br /><br />Scratching around for other things to say, my only concern about Stash teas is what appears to be plastic coated aluminum sashes that the teabags are sealed in. That does a great job in terms of sealing in flavor, but I'd rather it wasn't either plastic or aluminum coated. Maybe there's no good alternative.<br /><br />The only other thing is that the latest boxes have changed the design of the semi-circular hole at the bottom of the box and the new design makes it near impossible to easily remove a sachet. You'll be attacking it with the scissors or opening the box lid to get them out.<br /><br />But what really matters is the flavor and this is simply the best!

review/summary: Best Licorice Spice Tea!
review/text: Licorice Spice is my most favorite daily tea flavor. Earl Grey is what I take in the winter instead of coffee. Stash's Licorice Spice is very strong, not weak like some other teas I've tried with this flavoring. If you had a Licorice Spice Tea years ago and wondering if you should get this, just know I'm glad I did!

review/summary: Hands down my favorite tea!
review/text: I've been "addicted" to this tea for years and glad that it has become more widely available.<br /><br />A few weeks ago my cousin and I were discussing our love of tea.  I put forth Licorice Spice as my favorite and she said her all time favorite was, surprisingly enough, a tea made by Aveda - the haircare company - called Comforting Tea.  She lamented that she found it hard to find and described the taste to me.  I immediately told her that she had to try Licorice Spice then.  A few days after my recommendation she emailed me that she had tried the Stash tea and it was EVEN BETTER than the Aveda one!  I so do love making converts!<br /><br />As an added bonus, I've discovered after many nights of letting the tea steep, forgetting about the cup I've made, but not wanting to waste the tea bag - it tastes really good cold too!

review/text: This tea is wonderful. Delightful taste of mango, you can make it stronger by adding more tea bags if strong is your preference. Add a little honey and its delicious.

Makes it easy being a college student and rushing out the door, i just grab a cup of hot water and throw the bag in. It even gets better as the tea bag stays in the water, which I usually also have a problem with.<br /><br />My boyfriend introduced me to this tea, and I hope you will try it!

review/summary: Weak, as usual for this brand
review/text: I bought this recently, not paying attention to brand.  When I got it home, I realized it was Stash, and thought, oh, no, here comes the weak tea!<br /><br />Indeed, as with other of their teas, it is weak.  I used up almost the entire box of tea bags to make a pitcher full of iced tea, and it was still pretty weak in flavor.  When I've made hot tea with it, I need two tea bags.<br /><br />The flavor is ok--I love the tartness of hibiscus and the raspberry--but it's really just too weak overall.  Will not purchase again.

review/summary: SOY??? WHY?
review/text: Maybe I didn't read the ingredient list thoroughly, because I was not expecting to find SOY in my tea!! What a disappointment! I called Stash to find out if the soy was GMO, and...the woman in customer service guarenteed me the suppliers sell them non-GMO soy. If this is the case, they really should label it as such. I like the flavor though, it's very soothing and gentle on the tummy (hence the three stars). The only way I will order again is if they start labeling the soy as non-GMO, i can't trust the product without a label!<br /><br />PS: after reading ingredient list again, I found NO mention of soy...

review/summary: Try this for Sore Throat or to Wind Down!!!
review/text: First of all, I am a tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea all my 60 years of life and I LOVE tea.  Stash is a wonderful tea and they have a tremendous line of delicious flavors out there right now. Stash chamomile is caffeine free.<br /><br />Now, let me share one of Kathy W's secrets with you. (S-h-h-h-h-h...) Chamomile tea is EXCELLENT for sore throats, scratchy throats, any throat irritation.  I first learned about Chamomile tea from my Greek neighbors. YaYa and PaPu always gave the grandchildren Chamomile tea whenever they got sick.  It not only is very soothing but it somehow soothes throat irritations.  Over the years, I have found that if I get a sore throat, I drink 2 cups of chamomile tea, one behind the other, and my throat STOPS hurting.  If it starts again the next day, I repeat the procedure, and it stops again.<br /><br />I rarely get sick now-a-days, and if I get a bug, it passes through and out real quick, but I have turned many a friend and co-worker on to my little secret.  It works!  Chamomile brews/steeps as a yellow tea and it has a different taste than black tea.  So, if the taste is strange to you initially, you will probably get used to it quickly.  I assure you, it beats the heck out of having a sore throat.  For a sore throat, you can also add honey if you want.  Honey makes it even more smooth and soothing.<br /><br />Some people also like a cup of chamomile tea before bedtime because it is soothing and helps them wind down.<br /><br />So, when you use this for a sore throat, and you realize it helped you or your children, do me a favor.  Look up to heaven and say Thank You to YaYa and PaPu Harjandrou for sharing this special secret with all of us.<br /><br />God Bless you all.<br /><br />(Note: I am not a doctor.)

review/text: I am dissapointed!! When I bought this product I thought I was buying the real Acai Tea. But when I read ingredients it occured that Acai is the only one of the ingredients from a lot of others. So I blamed myself because I had to read those ingredients before I bought this Tea. I was fooled because the tea is named as "Acai Tea" so I thought it really was Acai. I reccomend everybody to read ingredients carefully before buying the product.

review/text: Those of you who love licorice or anise flavor and who happen to be tea-drinkers, rejoice! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic. The anise/licorice flavor is intense. The tea is relatively sweet, so in my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary, but you may want to add a little honey to it. This is not a wimpy tea, but full bodied and the longer you steep it, the stronger it gets.

review/text: I first tried this tea 4 years ago when a friend introduced it to me at work.  I was able to buy it at Trader Joes but they discontinued stocking it in my local store about a year ago.  I then found this online directly from Stash and bought boxes at a time.  I am a person who finds it hard to drink water but this herb tea helps me drink up to 10 huge mugs of it a day. Lemon and ginger combination is perfect to satisfy the need for sweet with a little bite at the end with the ginger. It has also helped me stop drinking caffeine drinks which lets me now sleep at night.  I will continue to buy this and recommend it highly.

review/summary: Tried it...loved it...now my favorite herbal tea
review/text: Based on the other review, I went and tried this tea.  As a choir member, I am always interested in licorice products since they soothe a worn voice.  However, many of the teas I have tried have too much ginger in it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this tea.<br /><br />1) The licorice taste is subtle, but definitely present.<br /><br />2) No sugar necessary.  As a dentist, I love this.  The licorice flavor doesn't jump out at you at first, but around 4 or 5 seconds after swallowing, the licorice "dances" around the sides of your tongue.  I don't know how else to describe it, but it really does dance.  I've never had that before.  Brilliant!<br /><br />3) It's best when over-steeped - like 10 minutes.<br /><br />4) Most grocery stores I've been to carry this, so it's readily available should you find yourself staring at an empty box early in the evening.

review/summary: Basic Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea
review/text: ***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***
