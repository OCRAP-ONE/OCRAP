review/summary: Intended for pod brewer; works used loose in French press
review/text: Packaging is very inviting, but there is not one word of instructions on the box or on the individually wrapped pouches.  When I opened the foil packet,the coffee fragrance was tantalizing. One side of the little pouch of coffee did say, "This side down." Not realizing they were for a pod brewer, I put them in my single cup drip maker with the appropriate side down--this yielded tasteless brown water like bad motel coffee that I threw away. Finally I saw one line on the Amazon product page that indicated these were for a pod brewer. Unfortunately, I do not have one, so I cut a little coffee bag open and dumped it into my single serve French press. This brewed a good, very strong cup of coffee.<br /><br />This is a decent product, but cries out for directions!!

review/text: This coffee has me looking forward to my breakfast coffee.<br />I've been able to get two good cups out of each pouch<br />on my single cut maker.<br />The resulting coffee isn't as oily as some blends that I have tried<br />recently. I'm enjoying this box while I can.<br />My local store doesn't stock these specialty brands.

review/summary: Great taste, but the packaging is strange to me.
review/text: The coffee has a very nice, chocolaty taste, very smooth, but the drawback was the packaging.  It comes in individual serving coffee bags, and I just have no idea how to use it.  I tried one cup like tea, pouring the water over it and letting it simmer, but by the time it got dark enough (I didn't know how long to steep it) it was cold.  I tried some other bags in a glass tea press, and that seemed to work better, but again didn't know how long to steep it.  There are no instructions on the package.  We usually make drip coffee, so maybe next time I'll just try stuffing a bunch of the coffee bags into the coffee maker.  I see the Amazon page says &lt;&lt;For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers>>.  I guess my problem is I have never heard of a Coffee Pod Brewer.<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP:  Today I put 8 of the pods in my drip pot and made 8 cups' worth and it was very good.  I called it chocolaty before, but maybe it's more like a mild cocoa flavor, slightly almond.  Very smooth and not at all bitter.  Great!

review/summary: Jamaica Mon
review/text: Four and One-Half Stars<br /><br />This coffee's packaging is a send-up of Jamaican style down to its name:  Marley Coffee.  (By the way, I actually saw Bob Marley walking by himself on West 57th Street in the late seventies).  Anyway, this coffee is meant for Pod coffee makers - did not realize this when I requested the coffee.  I do not own a pod coffeemaker.  You get 15 individual pod packets.  Each pod holds a single serving/cup of coffee.  To enable brewing in my coffee maker, I just cut the pods open and dumped into a coffee filter, and voila!  Coffee has nice rich aroma, and it has a full flavor.  It's definitely a better coffee than I had been drinking, which was your basic old school supermarket stuff.  For reference, I am not someone who tolerates strong coffee well.  Starbucks can give me a panic attack!  So, I thought the kick and richness was very nice and just right for me.<br /><br />As others have commented, if you're into that deep & dark, caffeine laden French roast, this may not be the coffee for you.

review/summary: A Safe coffee that won't offend anyone
review/text: Comes in round, flat, pods so beware before purchasing. I just dropped one in the filter holder of my regular coffee maker used about 1 cup of water and it worked out OK. There are no instructions on the box on what to do with the pods, how much water or what machines it might work with.<br /><br />Evaluation:<br />Comes in single serving pods.<br />Nice packaging.<br />Light to medium strength coffee.<br />Tastes very slightly burnt.<br />Unlike what the advertising says, I taste no "berry notes".<br />No acidic taste (a plus).<br />Organic<br />Fair trade certified means farmers are paid a fair price for their coffee beans.<br /><br />In my opinion, there's better coffee out there, but worth a try. This coffee is fine for the average coffee drinker. It's not bold enough for the purist, but won't offend them either.

review/summary: Nice coffee but a little acid
review/text: It's always great to find a special product, and Marley Coffee is just such a find.  The pods are handy, and organic is a good thing as is Fair Trade.  I'm going to disagree, however, with the reviewer who found the coffee too weak if the pods are used like tea bags.  I found just the opposite.  The coffee produced in my machine was far weaker than that produced when I just stuck the pod in the cup and poured boiling water over it.  The result from the "tea-bagging" approach was strong and a little more acid than I like, but it had a good coffee flavor.  In the machine I got more of a "coffee-flavored water" result even when I used three pods together.<br /><br />It's worth a try if you have a single-serve machine and it's a handy way to carry your own coffee on trips as it truly does do fairly well in either machine or tea-bag use.  I suspect the flavor will be a matter of personal taste, so give it a try and decide for yourself.  There are other Fair Trade organic coffees out there, but this is the first I've come across in pods.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds "single serve pods" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said "teabagging" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: "This side down"  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.  At least to the point where you let us know if any special equipment is required to use a product.

review/summary: Great Concept, But Where Are the Directions?
review/text: There is really nothing I love more than a great cup of coffee. However, if you want to make a great cup of coffee, then you need directions to show you how to get the most out of the coffee you are using.<br /><br />Although this coffee should be foolproof,(they are single serving bags, similar to a tea bag) there are no directions in the package to tell you how to make the best cup of coffee possible.<br /><br />I would like to have known things like:<br /><br />How much water do I use?<br /><br />Will filtered or distilled water make a better cup of coffee?<br /><br />How long should I soak the little coffee pack in the water?<br /><br />How hot should the water be for the best brewing?<br /><br />The company has a great concept. They want to offer you a great cup of coffee, that's environmentally friendly, and they want to help kids at the same time. You've won my heart. However, they had all the information you need to know about the company, its ideology, causes they support, and even where the coffee comes from and how the coffee is produced.<br /><br />Like I said, there were no brewing recommendations/directions on the package or in the box. If you don't mind a little trial and error, this is a great product. Get it right, and the coffee tastes great.

review/summary: Good Taste but Expensive
review/text: I make my own coffee at the office.  I have a coffee cup, water, and a microwave oven.  I have been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1KJO">Folgers Coffee Singles</a>, which resemble tea bags. I place water in the coffee cup, heat it in the microwave, and then plop the Folgers in the hot water.  The result is acceptable, but not great,<br /><br />Although, the Marley coffee may not be designed for tea bag use, that is how I tried it.  I have found that the flavor is good and the taste is strong enough depending on how long the packet is left in the water.<br /><br />On the plus side, the Marley coffee can be used in a tea-bag manner, has good taste, and is fair trade coffee.  On the minus side, it costs around twice as much as the Folgers.  I will have to continue to experiment with it to see if it justifies the extra cost.

review/text: The broth, with water added (this is condensed soup), is the best tasting one that I have tried (even better than the chicken noodle).<br /><br />I used this last winter for whenever felt a cold coming on, and had only minor colds last winter, instead of the usual miserable colds that used to get most winters.<br />Decide to have it handy again this winter.<br /><br />The rest of what is in it, rice and chicken, is very minimal.

review/summary: very vigorous
review/text: This is an extremely vigorous top fermenting yeast.  As stated it is very alcohol resistant.  The actual tolerance of this yeast strain for alcohol is somewhat higher then the stated 22%, however the rate of fermentation does slow considerably above 22%.<br /><br />This yeast strain also does not have any problem functioning in high gravity sugar solutions.  So, I have found it unnecessary to do multi-stage fermenting.  This is a moderate sulphur producing yeast.  Nothing that should be a problem given some conditioning.<br /><br />The flavor profile is actually fairly neutral, with just a little fruitiness.  There is noticeable phenol alcohol production at temps above 80F.  This is a bit of a "take no prisoners" kind of yeast.  As in, it tends to ferment anything even remotely fermentable.  In that way it's a bit like a champagne yeast.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased indeed.  This is a great yeast for un-sticking your fermentation, or for making a fast batch of cider.  Unless you like your cider very dry, you will probably want to cold-crash your cider during peak fermentation.  If you wait until primary fermentation is done, your likely to end up with rocket fuel instead of cider.

Smoked teas aren't for everyone and even for a smoked tea this one is rather unique.  But I think the light pine undertone to the smoky malty flavor is absolutely perfect.

review/text: First, let me say that my husband likes this just fine.  I think it's awful.  We bought it for a recipe.  The aroma of cheap pine incense overwhelms the tea aroma when you open the can, and the same is true of the made tea.  One word:  yuck.  I do not want to use it in the recipe.  I'm sure it would overwhelm all of the other flavors.

review/summary: Hantana Pearl Mushroom Kit
review/text: This is about the third kit I have grown. The Hantana bag kit comes with everything you need, except the water, about 2 cups of used coffee grounds and a small amount of hydrogen peroxide. The directions are clear and really very simple. Mix the contents as per instructions, seal the bag. Be patient. A white mycleeium will start to form in about 7 to 14 days. It will continue to grow through out the bag. Again follow directions by cutting an X in the bag, fold back the plastic(tape it out of the way) and spray/mist the opening every day, per directions. Soon small pinheads will form, then it will grow more quickly. Amazing to watch how fast they grow. Your kids or grandkids will love the project. The best part of all is cutting the flush off and eating the mushrooms. They are delecious and you can't get them fresher. The flavor and texture are wonderful. After the first flush, let the bag rest for a few days and start the process (cut X and spray) on the opposite side. After the second flush, I broke the mycellium apart and put it in the compost with some Oak tree shavings/sawdust/chips and began to water it about twice a week. I have picked two flushes in the past two months. Outstanding, and I believe there will be more.<br />March 2nd, 2012-It has been almost a month since I wrote the review. Today I noticed two seperate flushes beginning in the compost. That makes 2 from the grow bag and 4 (so far) from the compost. I will order more soon. The folks at The Imaginary Farmer add a personal touch with their helpful costomer service. My questions by email have been answered promptly.

It really would be perfect for anyone. Children, adults, except maybe elephants because they don't have thumbs. Buy this thing and enjoy easily $20 worth of healthy oyster mushrooms. Way better than what you get in the store and you could even grow this on your desk at work if you wanted. Not that I have a desk at work, but I can't see why not. Ok cheers! Happy living!

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: Received my mushroom kit promptly from "The Imaginary Farmer".  Directions were easy to follow in setting up the kit.  Everything was included except for used coffee grounds and hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, and a misting bottle (all under a dollar each to purchase.)  After the 10 days in the dark, I checked the bag for 3 days and decided it was time to start the fruiting.  Having second thoughts about perhaps opening it too soon, I contacted the supplier and was reassured that it would come out ok, and what to do if it didn't.  Three days later, my kit went crazy and the mushrooms grew before my eyes...I posted pictures on my Facebook page twice a day and amazed my friends as well.  Any time I had a question, I emailed "The Imaginary Farmer" and was promptly answered by Owen Tallman.  I felt like they treated me like I was their only client and were as pleased with my results as I was.  I have cooked with the mushrooms twice and they have been delicious.  I am looking forward to my second "flush" of mushrooms from the kit.

review/summary: 4.5 for the Veggie One!
review/text: I bought several varieties of this brand and this one I was the most curious about. The texture in this case was soft, like freshly made jello, and I used the More Than Gourmet Veggie-glace Gold Roasted Vegetable Demi-glace, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2) a couple of times. Once in a broth to taste the flavor and the other time in the capacity I wanted to use it in the first place: Making fresh Pinto Beans from scratch. My desire was to have an all vegetable approach instead of using poultry of beef base for this dish. I added to the liquid about 4 oz of the product and dissolved it in the almost boiling water. I also added a little sea salt, fresh peppercorns, some garlic powder, and a dash or two of Herbes Provence. What happened is that after a few hours of slow cooking the water turned a beautiful color resembling the ingredients plus I noticed it had thickened considerably, which is always a good thing. Like the well respected reviewers of this line of products had said in the past that made me want to buy it, the salt content is almost non existing. The beans ended up silky smooth and after adding the proper onions and a can of diced tomatoes mexican style (with a little jalape&ntilde;os thrown in for kicks) the final product was very tasty and I was glad for I have tried several vegetable broths, bullions, powders you name it and never really was impressed. One thing I have concluded is that the flavor of this demi-glaze is kind of subtle, I guess is the nature of vegetables not to be too overpowering and it reflects on the taste.<br />An all Vegetable Based Pinto Beans even though I know beans are not from the vegetable family, per say, they tasted very very good and the almost gravy like results of the accompanying broth without having to add any kind of thickener is what sealed the respect I have for this product for me. It seems that as it boils it caramelizes the water? Go figure the reasons but well worth the price of admission. Which has left me with a new found respect for concentrated forms of veal, poultry, mushroom, beef and of course, Veggies. By adding the proper seasoning to let's say lentils, green pees, garbanzos, etc etc., you can rest assured that starting the cooking process with a helper such as this can only mean great results for the finished product. I might have to check other demi-glazes in the free world like in Sonoma-Williams for they sure beat the less expensive, sodium ridden, chemically challenged, not very natural products I used in not such a distant past. 4.5 and long live legumes! Far out!

review/summary: They've changed the Bold formula
review/text: Last week, I opened a recently purchased bag of Bold Chex Mix to find that they have changed both the contents and the taste.  They have stopped including the round crackers and have changed the tube-shaped "breadsticks" to the squiggly, harder version that is also found in the Hot 'n Spicy version.  There is barely any seasoning on any of the contents, especially the pretzels.  Initially, when I opened the package, I did a double-take, thinking that I had accidentally purchased the Traditional variety.  If someone were to separate the pretzels from the rest of the mix for a taste-test, I doubt that most people would be able to tell that they were supposed to be seasoned at all; the ones in this bag were just plain.<br /><br />I called the Betty Crocker 800 number to voice my opinion about the disappointing changes that I had found - I bring Bold Chex Mix in my lunch about 3 times per week, and it is my favorite.  The customer service rep. acknowledged that they had recently changed the formula and contents and apologized for my disappointment.

review/summary: Better than traditional Chex Mix
review/text: I'm not going to disagree with the first reviewer, as snacks and food in general are high subjective.  I got turned on to Chex Mix, not as a person that is traditionally into trail mix, where I imagine many people are coming from. Rather, I like crappy potato chips and cheeze doodle, etc.<br /><br />I tried the traditional Chex Mix and got hooked, but found I hated how many pretzels they had in them.  I don't mind some, but I seemed to always be picking around them.  Anyway, I forget how I came across the bold, but they basically sprinkle on some powder flavor that is kind of a zesty salty/garlic'ish/tangy dust, and everything tastes even better.  Better yet, it makes the pretzels more tolerable in quantity.<br /><br />These things are really great, but what is annoying is every place sells the smaller bags (which I consider to include these 8.75oz bags), and this is really good (yet I'm sure crappy for your health) grazing TV watching/coding on the computer/video game playing with a soda snacking food.<br /><br />Brought them to the office and everyone seemed to like them for what they are. Junk food snaking.

review/text: I never thought I'd be reviewing snack food, but ZOMG how much do I love the Bold Party Blend Chex Mix! You know how at the bottom of a bag of regular Chex Mix you'll find that Chex piece that has been super-saturated with all of the seasonings and magic pixie dust they put in there? That's how every piece of Bold Party Blend Chex Mix tastes. So freaking good and so addictive.<br /><br />Yes, they changed the formula recently (substituting ingredients and dialing down the intensity of the flavor), but this is still the snack food of the gods. A bag of this stuff will definitely ruin you for regular Chex Mix, not to mention just about every other kind of snack food.<br /><br />Oh, and the super-saturated Chex pieces at the bottom of the Bold Party Blend bag...sheer awesomeness.

It's very condescending that Betty Crocker thinks people can't notice the decline in quality. Taste of Worcestshire Sauce? Not even close. Bland, bland, bland.

review/text: Chex Mix Bold is tasty, although the mix differs from the package shown. I like it better than the old version, as I found the round crackers in the old version rather bland. The cereal is crispy, the rye crisps crunchy and the flavor is just the right bold for me (there's a similar store brand version of this at Food Lion and it is way too oniony for my taste buds!). My only complaint about the new Chex Mix Bold is that the pretzels aren't really crispy and sometimes taste on the stale side, ruining an otherwise perfect snack food!

So, it isn't just flakes like it appears in the picture.  It is wheat-like flakes, corn flakes, those little bran long pieces, and oats.<br /><br />It's just slightly sweet, which is nice.

review/summary: Good spices, poor packaging and shipping
review/text: I am at a loss as to why they package these spices the way they did. You know those spice jars you buy at the dollar store with the little clear plastic shaker top inside the black top? These spices don't have that clear plastic top inside, or a safety seal. When you receive these, they are literally just a glass jar of spices with no seal and a loose fitting black screw cap. I assume this is why the whole jar is wrapped in at least 3 feet of bubble wrap. Even so, as other reviews for this brand have noted, they leak. Any why wouldn't they? I consider myself lucky because only one of the 6 spices I ordered had leaked, and it was only slightly. This must have been because of the inordinate amount of bubble wrap - there was so much that I actually felt guilty for ordering so many jars and having wasted so much plastic.<br /><br />If they just put either a shaker cap or at least a vacuum safety seal they wouldn't need to use so much plastic (truly a ridiculous amount), and the other reviews of spilled spices wouldn't be a concern.<br /><br />On to the spices themselves...very fragrant but I have only used one so far, the herbs de provence. It was good, and for the price I would continue to buy it although I do think I like the Frontier organic spices better, even if it is just for the jar (with the shaker!).<br /><br />Summary - be wary of ordering until they add a seal or a cap inside, so there isn't so much plastic. I buy organic because I care about the health benefits, but I also care about the environment and lack of pesticides, and all this plastic negates even buying these.

review/summary: Perfect for adding flavor to dry food. Our little dog loves this stuff
review/text: I don't know a lot about dogs but I thought they ate anything. The dachshund we had growing up would eat banana peels if you left them out. We rescued a Maltese (5 years ago now) and while he is healthy, he eats when he's hungry and leaves the rest.  He's never like doggy treats, bones etc. and prefers human food/meat to anything for dogs. Since I've read dry food is best for dogs we feed him dry but again, he eats when hungry but doesn't lick his chops. Cesar is the best dog food I've found to add to the dry for taste. We get at least 4 feedings from one container, which make it pretty cheap. We simply mix a spoonful into the dry food for flavor and he's got the best of both worlds. If I could find a dry food tasty enough to be served solo, I would buy it but he eats such a small amount of food I don't mind making it tasty.

review/summary: We're both happy at long last!
review/text: I have two dogs, but only one of them eats Cesar chicken "in meaty juices" (it HAS to be the "in meaty juices kind!) and she GOBBLES IT. after years of searching for a food she'll eat to enjoy, not just eat to survive, we've finally found a winner!<br /><br /> Gigi is a 9-year-old Papillon mix who is both dainty, firecely independent, and plain fierce when she's disturbed, while 1-year-old Mini-Dachshund Sophie is a happy, bouncy, and utterly addicted to attention. Gigi spends her time under the bed, Sophie is wherever I am. What Sophie eats is actually still TBD. This is Gigi's review.<br /><br />Both of them have been picky eaters. Gigi went years on starving herself until she couldn't hold out any longer, then deigning to eat the dry food we supply between wet food dinners, even as we tried all kinds of different foods to tempt her. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH02I">Beneful Dog Food Prepared Meals Beef Stew Dog Food, 10-Ounce Plastic Containers (Pack of 8)</a> used to work now and then, and though it was expensive, we could get 3 servings from it. However, even though it had a lid, it would often grow moldy even before the next meal. So even though she liked it, it was wasted and really too expensive anyway.<br /><br />When Sohpie arrived, we'd been serving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJF62Y">Mighty Dog Hearty Pulled-Style Chicken Dinner In Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> with the longest sustained success yet, about a year. Only chicken, mind you, and it had to be the chunky in sauce kind, NOT the pate kind. Well, along came the puppy, and Gigi expressed her distaste by wasting food again.<br /><br />Finally, I've found Cesar. And oddly, now it has to be the p�t&eacute; kind, I.e. "in meaty juices" NOT the chunky kind! But AT LAST we've found a dog food that The Mrs. will absolutely SNARF ON. She doesn't come up for air when I put any chicken-based "in meaty juices" Cesar dinner in front of her, which I cube into bite sizes.<br /><br />The added bonus is that I can hide pills in the cubes. Gigi's been diagnosed with congenital heart failure, and she's on 3 different pills, 3 times a day. Dinner is the easier dose, because I just push the little pills into the soft p�t&eacute;, and she's none the wiser because she swallows the cubes almost whole! Sadly, we won't probably have Gigi with us for the fourteen or fifteen years I've been blessed to have spent with my previous dogs. But I'm determined to make sure she's as healthy and happy as possible in the time we have. She may be feisty, prickly, and a loner, but when I *can* catch her, she does love to snuggle with her mama.<br /><br />Cesar "in nearby juices" dog food might just give me a few month's more snuggled than we'd otherwise have.

review/text: I have a 5 lb Maltese who eats more like a cat. He eats until he is full and walks away. Dry food is best, I am told but it so.... "dry". I don't want to give him human food because I'm told I shouldn't - but also because he eats so little, I want to be sure he's healthy. My solution has been to buy Cesar by the case from Amazon (auto shipment) and mix it with his dry. I buy dry food for small adult dogs, mix a scoop (1 cup?) with 1/4-1/3 container of Cesar. I mix it with a for or my hands (so he doesn't just eat the Cesar and walk away). He gets the benefit of dry food for his teeth etc and the tastiness of Cesar's wonderful flavors.

review/text: I have purchased every jar of Jalapeno jelly that I have ever seen.  If it is on the shelf at the local grocery story, a specialty store, Trader Joe's, or Whole Foods, I have tried it.  However, nothing is a good as this one.  In fact, all those other jellies have gone directly to the garbage can after tasting.  When I could no longer find this at my local grocery store I began ordering it from Amazon.  I have one jar in the fridge and five on the shelf.  I can't bear the idea of being without it.  I think Braswell's has hit the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  This is delicious on toast in the morning.  I also love combining it with peanut or almond butter -- it really hits the spot.  The hot/spicy element means that you don't have to use too much of it to taste it and so it can be somewhat low calorie as well.<br /><br />LOVE IT.

I've put it in the tuna when making tuna fish sandwiches.  Yum.  I think I'm addicted.<br />This company packages the product so well, I think it would be impossible for the glass jars to break during transit.<br />I am so happy to find it online.  Now I don't have to drive to the specialty grocery store to get it.  Thank you!

review/summary: The Spice Of Life!
review/text: Every year I will make around 5gals of spaghetti sauce. After it cools, I'll put it in 1gal freezer bags and freeze it for quick easy meals. Without the Italian seasoning & the onion powder that I purchased, my sauce would be very hum-drum & bland. Checking other web sites I found that by far the best price for the spices is right here. Don't be fooled by other offers for "like" products. The onion powder is granulated not powdered dust. The Italian season is coarse and not bits & pieces of the "leftovers" that other companies package. Don't get me wrong, there are quite a few Spice Companies out there but right here is by far the best offer!<br />Happy Cooking!<br />Cheers!<br />Dave

review/summary: I highly recommend this Sumatra Dark Roast
review/text: I just recieved this coffee and I have brewed about 20 cups of coffee so far. I use a burr grinder and a very nice Starbucks drip coffee maker. In fact, I am enjoying a cup of the cofffe right now after dragging my lazy behind out of bed at 9am&lt;g>.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this roast. The beans arrived fresh and well packed with a valve on the heavy poly bag. The beans are of a uniform roast with a nice oily sheen throughout. There is no chaff mixed in with the beans. I do some home roasting of my own beans so I have an idea of what the process is and I can state confidently that these are well roasted, cleaned of chaff and that the roast is in fact a dark roast.<br /><br />The coffee tastes just as I like it, a full rich flavor without that acidic slightly burned flavor of a French roast. The taste is very smooth and rich, the main traits that attracted me to Starbucks coffee, craft roasters and eventually home roasting.<br /><br />I get free shipping from Amazon and I bought this on their subscription program, so it cost me $31 plus tax. I think this is a very good price and I would gladly make this roast my daily brew.<br /><br />I recommend this roast without reservation.<br /><br />-Mike

review/summary: A bit "Hit or Miss"
review/text: I have been chasing that perfect cup for some time now, lately through Amazon by buying and splitting the bags with a neighbor. I use a press, the neighbor goes drip. The first bag of this Sumatra was the best consumer coffee that either of us had ever found.  It shipped to us extremely fresh, still working off gas in the bag and foaming in my press pot.  The aroma from the bag was strong and wonderful and it carried through to the press and into the cup. Bag #1 was easily the best coffee either of us had ever brewed.<br /><br />The second bag was quite a disappointment, not stale but also not really fresh, with only marginal aroma in the bag and not even recognizable as coffee in the cup.  However, even at that the flavor still matched up close to our previous best finds here at Amazon- about the Fogbuster level.  We decided to give it another try, and bag #3 was somewhere in between, but still only a pretender when compared to that first bag.<br /><br />One interesting thing about this coffee, which I have experienced with no other:  I am single and make a press first thing in the morning. Then (coffee connoisseurs stop reading now) warm additional cups up in the microwave as the morning goes on.  Something about this coffee takes the microwave rewarming far, far better than any other coffee I have ever used.  I don't understand why, but it does- all the way into the evening if need be (OK, I'll admit it, sometimes even overnight).  Single guy, what can I say, but that is a significant bonus for me.<br /><br />My shipments come from Lexington, KY.  I assume Amazon has warehouses around the country.  Part of my fresh/not-so-fresh problem might be due to the volume consideration and turnaround at that particular warehouse. We have decided to give the Sumatra one more try but I feel we will more than likely be moving along after bag #4.  I'll let you know how it goes.

review/summary: Good if you brew it right
review/text: I initially hated this coffee, until I learned that the problem wasn't the coffee but my brewing technique.  This isn't a great coffee, but it can be a reasonably good coffee if you brew it right.  My problem was that initially I was not brewing it correctly.<br /><br />I'm still not using fancy coffee grinding or brewing equipment, but now I follow brewing guidelines that you can get on any good coffee lover website, including brewing at the right temperature, preheating the cup and filter holder, rinsing the filter, and pouring water into the ground coffee in the right way.<br /><br />I use a Melitta style drip filter.  I have a Bodum French Press that improves the taste even more, but I choose to use a paper filter because studies have indicated that paper filters eliminate most of the components in coffee that raise LDL and hence cholesterol (look up "Health effects of coffee" in Wikipedia for more info).<br /><br />I keep the beans in a half dozen baggies in the freezer and just remove them from the freezer as I need them.<br /><br />One thing I learned from my brewing experiments is that brewing technique may help a mediocre coffee more than a really good coffee.  Using my former poor brewing techniques, Camano Island Sumatra tasted terrible but Peet's Sumatra and Starbucks Sumatra both tasted good (though the Starbucks had more variation in quality).  Improving my brewing technique made the Peets somewhat better but improved the Camano Island Sumatra dramatically.  I haven't tried the Starbucks since changing my brewing technique, so I can't report on that.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great coffee, this isn't it, but if you're looking for a decent-tasting inexpensive Sumatra and are willing to use standard recommended brewing techniques, Camano Island Sumatra can be a good choice.

review/summary: Good but one dimensional
review/text: This coffee is made across  the passage from me.  Much better price than I can get locally.  I am normally a French roast drinker and I find this coffee a little less complex and not as rich as I normally drink. However many will enjoy it as it is definitely a premium coffee.  I hope to try their one of their other blends once I am through this five pounds.
