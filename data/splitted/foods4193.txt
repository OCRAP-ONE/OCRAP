review/summary: Bottom of the Barrel?
review/text: These seeds were accompanied by small broken pieces of seed that just make the bag weigh 1 pound but the water is cloudy at rinsing and doesn't germinate.  They sift their way to the bottom of the barrel and should be thrown out.  They are included to weigh a full pound with pieces that should not be included. I have been growing wheatgrass for over 15 years.  I will not buy these seeds again.

review/summary: I baked my first loaf of bread!
review/text: I purchased this 1-pound package of hard red wheat berries for my first attempt at grinding my own flour and making my own whole wheat bread. And what a success!  The wheat berries were clean and flavorful - good enough to pinch a few berries during grinding to chew on them plain.  And the bread came out with  excellent flavor and texture.  Now I wish I'd purchased more!  One pound is only enough for one loaf of bread.

review/summary: Perfect for Potty Training
review/text: These treats are the perfect size for training, and my pugs love them.  I don't think they are expensive at all, so I don't know why the previous reviewer gave these only one star.  The treats are about a centimeter in diameter, so you can give your pet many of these before they constitute an actual "treat" portion.  You won't regret buying these if you have a puppy who needs positive reinforcement.

review/text: The first time I tried Kukicha twig tea at my friend's house, I instantly fell in love with it. It had a rich and nutty brown rice taste.If you shop around, Kukicha twig tea is actually kind of pricy. I decided to make this purchase, because the price seem like a bargain and it was organic. However, the flavor........ is another story. I am still dreaming about my friend's kukicha tea, while this sits some where collecting dust. It'll probably be better to buy something more expensive.

review/summary: Truffles or fillers?
review/text: This truffle puree product really lacked the strong truffle flavor i was expecting.  I did not understand why, when they are sold in packs of three (25g x 3), the recipe attached, although i did not use, asked for 200g of truffle puree.  (That would mean 8 tubes of puree).  I would stick with whole truffles in it's juices over the truffle puree.

review/summary: Taste of Home!
review/text: We ordered two 2-packs for our kitchen and mum's.  No self-respecting German would be without Maggi in her kitchen!  We've known the product all of our lives [70 years for mum]. We use it for soups, stews and vegetables, and there are lots of other ideas on the label.<br /><br />One caution to a new user:  to us, it does NOT taste like soy sauce, so if you're thinking soy and use it for your sushi, you may not like it.  We stick to the "seasoning" uses vs. the common soy sauce uses.<br /><br />The bottles were well-packed for shipping, and the service was quick from this vendor, too.  We will be repeat customers!

review/summary: NOTHING like the REAL Maggi!!!!!!
review/text: I fell in love with Maggi seasoning while in Switzerland - I brought home a bottle and became addicted!  I was excited to see it available in the States, but when the seasoning arrived, I was turned off by the "chemically" smell and taste!  It doesn't taste anything close to the real deal.  I still have a bit left of the original I had purchased in Switzerland, so I did a taste comparison - there is no doubt that what is available in America is NOT what you can get in Europe.  Like the Maggi you can get in Europe (which is produced by Nestle), this version is also supposedly produced by Nestle, but UNLIKE the stuff you get in Europe (which is manufactured in Germany), this "Maggi" is produced in CHINA.  And it tastes like it - the chemical taste and aroma is so overwhelming, I think I just have to throw out the two bottles I ordered!  Total bummer!  If you love Maggi, find an importer of German products rather than try and buy this version...

review/text: I'm actually gonna check out price comparisons now, I should honestly look at buying some maggi bulk from manufacturer. I've been using Maggi as a food enhancer since I can remember, it was on my parents parents tables, for example. Anyway, it's not like an every meal thing (not even every day), but yeah, I will never not want Maggi. Regardless, this gets 5 stars because it's Maggi. There is practically zero chance you will dislike it. Not at all an exaggeration or wives' tale: Every single person we've introduced to it has loved it and become a user.<br /><br />I think it's like crack.

review/text: This may well be my favorite packaged lentil soup and is my favorite from Taste Adventures (I also like their Split Pea and their Black Bean).  I like the curry seasoning; the packaging is convenient; preparation is easy.  One package makes enough soup to serve as side dishes for two people or as the main course for one.  After preparation, the soup is delicious and has a nice thick consistency, almost like a vegetarian chili.  I usually enjoy it with grated cheese, a nice grainy bread and red wine.

review/summary: Great pancakes and more, bravo Orgran.
review/text: This is a very good substitute for real pancakes. I'm celiac and have tried some truly abysmal rice pancake mixes, but this buckwheat is wonderful. I make it with a pinch of salt and use buttermilk, and it's even more like Bisquick taste. On my first attempt and just mixing by guess it made a very respectable crepe by thinning with milk and a little International Delight cinnamon hazelnut coffee creamer. It's near impossible to burn, much more forgiving than wheat to extra heat. I can't imagine what the pan review was tasting but it wasn't this mix.

review/summary: powder goes up in the air
review/text: i wasn't satisfied with this mix. What really bothered me is when I opened the bag and slowly emptied the flour into a bowl, it just let out a cloud of flour dust into the air while settling into the bowl. It was more airborne dust than I ever had to deal with from any flour! Also, this is a mix and though it says buckwheat, the mix contains less than 50% buckwheat flour, which to me is overpriced. it's more economical and healthy to buy a denser flour, and add your own baking powder and baking soda to it. The taste is okay but I added my own mashed bananas and pumpkin puree to the batter, for more nutrition and flavor.

And, I admit that I have eaten my fair share too :)<br />He doesn't care that it's baby food (or maybe doesn't realize it), he loves them and I hear him tell his friends about them too, which is very cute.

review/summary: Slim, on-the-go, single flavor
review/text: Of the fruit leathers, this is one of my preferred flavors.  I like the package of all one flavor so I don't have a multi-pack with less preferred-flavors like apple.  Compared to most dried mango, this has less flavor and tenderness, but because it is a dried puree, it is a different product and thus can't 100% be compared. I would give Philippine Brand dried mango five stars and this mango fruit leather four stars.  These fruit leathers come in single-serve packets, which, like all single-serve packets, are wasteful, so I try to use these when I need the packaging, such as on the go, in the pocket, camping, and travel.

review/summary: Perfect work snack!
review/text: I keep a few of these and the apple flavor at my desk at work.  These are a great mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack; sweet, but not too sweet, and the perfect size.  It's an added bonus that there's no added sugar.  The taste is great, though these are a bit stickier than other flavors.  I think sticky fingers is a small price to pay for a delicious, healthy snack.

review/text: Stretch Island Original Fruit Leather, Mango, 0.5 oz Bars (Pack of 30)  This was purchased for a family of 7. All 7 of us at various ages enjoyed this on kayaking trips and packed in lunches for 3 working in a foundry.<br />  They are slender and easily fit into just about anything. The flavor of these mango bars was excellent and I was disappointed when I went to purchase them again and they were not readily available. I tried 3 more times that week when logging onto Amazon.com but they just were not available the second half of June.

Im a guy so not sure of women will like it this way but i use it on my steamed veggies, meats and even sometimes eggs when I want a kick.  For Split Chicken Breast with skin, I powder the top with this and a little of the Hot Version and make big slices in the meat so it can seep in.  Then back for 45-50 min at 375.  Good stuff!!

review/text: I bought this seasoning at a New Orleans cooking school and splashed and dashed it on everything until my container went dry.  I am so glad to find a source for this as I have not seen it in any of our local stores.  This has just the right amount of spice to add a dash of heat and flavor, with the hot version I had to be very careful to not sprinkle too much but this version is more forgiving. It does have salt, I just add a few shakes for flavor and adjust my salt seasoning accordingly.  The flavors are well balanced and give more interest than just adding red pepper or cayenne.

It is really such a great spice with a little bit of a kick but not enough to floor you.  It has a great flavor.  Some "hot" spices just burn but don't have much of a flavor.  Or, they are kind of sour tasting (too much citrus, maybe?).  This "Slap ya Mama" is really good.  We love it!

review/text: Now that I have found nirvana in the form of red licorice, there is no reason to keep trying other brands.  The texture is completely satisfying, the way the log gives way to soft chewy goodness, the way the hint of slightly sour essence of pure raspberry rises to the top.  Unlike other high end licorice I've tried, there are no artificial colors like Kookaburra, and the texture is so much more RIGHT than Panda (which has more of a sticky wheat-type texture and less berry flavor).  I'm sold on this form of life pleasure.

review/summary: This licorice tastes absolutely ATROCIOUS
review/text: I've come to really appreciate good gourmet licorice recently, including Lucky Country, Darrell Lea, and I'm awaiting a shipment of Kookaburra licorice right now. I received these today and I couldn't be more disappointed with the product. For starters, this licorice isn't soft, and it's quite sticky, which of course leaves my fingers sticky and messy after eating them. This would be excusable if the taste was good, but these just taste horrendous. The best way I can describe it is if someone were to spray raspberry scented perfume on some wax, roll it up into a log and put it in a bag. Needless to say, I won't be buying again, ever. After trying other delicious brands of licorice from abroad, I never thought I would say this, but Twizzlers taste better than these things.

review/summary: not actual licorice?
review/text: I adore their black, and since the store was out, I bought some of this. Ugh. I tried it, then I kept eating since I paid money for it, until finally I just couldn't finish it, and it sits in my pantry. I think I will throw it away today.

review/text: I actually looked for this brand of truffle oil because I had a little sampler from a friend that blew me away.  Not only did I find it, I found it in a box of six.  I add this too all my salads, meats and pasta with great joy--definitely adds to the cafeteria food they serve in Afghanistan.  My war time meals are "molto bene" thanks to this amazing oil.

review/summary: Best. Gum. Ever.
review/text: I primarily bought this gum (and some other Orbit gums) here on Amazon because the local stores are hit and miss, but also, it's slightly cheaper to buy it in bulk here.<br /><br />But seriously, IMO, this is the best sugarfree gum I've ever had. It's like an injection of minty ice. All my tastebuds are on high alert. I once had a subway sandwich with tons of jalapenos after chewing this stuff and it burned like mad when usually, spicy is no big deal whatsoever. Also, ice water, after chewing this stuff, is painful. The crystal thingies are the bomb.<br /><br />Anywho, yeah, good gum, try some at a gas station first if you're not sure.

review/text: I love this gum, but it's getting harder to find in most brick and mortar stores.  Of course, Amazon has it!  Good stuff.  Orbit changed the formula on their standard peppermint gum a while ago - the peppermint mist gum tastes more like the original.

review/text: I tried the fact that I frequent sufferer of dry mouth at mid morning to all way to night. It just doesn't last long, I felt like I chewing rubber at some point. Flavor vanished and fact that gum lost its chewy texture? I not sure what else you call that? SO I stopped chewing this gum. Looking for mints now.

review/summary: Love Bob's Red Mill Hulled Hemp Seed
review/text: I began using Bob's Red Mill Hulled Hemp Seed several months ago for the added omega and protein.  I had changed my diet, or I would rather call it a lifestyle, and continue to eat mostly steamed veggies and fresh fruits.  I add the hemp seed to my fruit and it is especially good with oatmeal and salads.  It can also be added to baked goods and most anything you are cooking.  I love the nutty texture and flavor it adds to foods.<br /><br />I have tried other brands, but prefer Bob's Red Mill Hulled Hemp Seed.  I have purchased it at health food stores, but found it was so much easier and less expensive to order online.  As recommended it can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer, so I buy a case at a time.<br /><br />Enjoy healthy eating!

review/summary: By far the best Hemp seed I have tried!!
review/text: I have been using Hemp Seeds for many months now and have tried several of the top brands for same on Amazon and in the health stores.  Each and every one had small hard pieces or hull pieces in the packages.  Bob's however is by far the best as none of that is in this product.  It tastes great and I wouldn't think of ever purchasing another brand. Yes it is a little more expensive but it is worth it if you don't like eating those hull and hard pieces of whatever is included in the others.<br />Enjoy and try this one.

review/summary: Would buy again, but not for a gift.
review/text: I really enjoyed this selection of k cups for my new Keurig. There was a really nice variety and I received one of at least every kind that was featured. Overall, the selection was great. However, I am glad that I did not purchase this item as a gift because the "gift box" looked almost as if an animal had ravaged it. It was torn in multiple places and basically falling apart. If I was giving this as a gift I would have had no choice but to re-package it. I would definitely buy this again for my own use, but would be cautious if buying it as a gift, especially if I were having it sent directly.

review/summary: Amazon's proce is double than in grocery store
review/text: I discoved this drink two weeks ago at a truck stop on my return home from Virginia. A cool can from their refrigerated diaplay cost $2.49. I liked the flavor and kick from the Starbucks Doubleshot Energy Plus Coffee drink and the Starbucks Doubleshot Energy Plus Mocha & Vanilla flavors, also $2.49 a can. I couldn't find either type in the local grocery store, so I automatically began my Amazon.com order then, right before I checked out, read the customer reviews from the other Amazon sites about the high price Amazon was charging $79.95 for a 12 pack of the Starbucks Doubleshop Energy Plus drink as well as $59.95. I checked with my local Walmart grocery store, and bought both kinds for $2.50 a 15 oz can which comes to only $30.00 for 12 cans.  I am very disappointed that Amazon.com is charging in excess for this product and will definitely do some comparative price shopping in the future before I automatically shop at Amazon.com.

review/summary: Price too expensive
review/text: I buy these Starbuck drinks daily at my local quick store at $1.99 a can. I as well found this price to be way too expensive and researched it and found it to be the same size can that I was paying half the price. I hope customers are not purchasing this from them in a 12 pack bulk which is normally sold in bulk for a cheaper price because at my local store I can purchase for under two bucks.

review/text: Yes, The price is very steep, and it is much cheaper in stores and gas stations, and they have value packs at stores like Walmart and Target. This and mountain dew are my favorite drinks, they got me through high school, and still do. They are so yummy and give you just the kick that many of us need when waking up to go to school, or work, or even just for your kiddo. You really can't go wrong with anything of theirs in stores, even those little glass bottles that come in a variety of flavors are great. You will not go wrong trying these out, so head to you local store and pick some up! :)

review/summary: Fast and easy, if a bit bland
review/text: Unlike the Sun-Bird Sweet and Sour Seasoning Mix, the Sun-Bird Beef and Broccoli Seasoning makes for a quick dinner.  I used a whole head of broccoli and chopped it myself; using packaged cut-up broccoli would make it even faster.  I used round steak, popped it in the freezer for a few minutes to make slicing easier, and even with broccoli and onion prep, the whole dinner took twenty minutes.<br /><br />There are only four components to the beef and broccoli dish--beef, broccoli, a chopped up onion and the sauce.  You combine the sauce mix with two tablespoons of soy sauce and water.  Even though I used a whisk, there were hunks of cornstarch in the liquid. I let the mixture sit for fifteen minutes, and the clumps went away though the mixture separated and had to be restirred.  Stir frying the beef, broccoli and onion was fast and easy and the sauce took only a few minutes to reduce.  The finished dish was OK, but pretty bland, and I added a little steak sauce for flavor, which helped a lot.  Catsup would also be a good addition, if not traditional.<br /><br />Consumers on low sodium diets and low fat diets should realize that the nutritional information on the package does not take into account the two tablespoons of soy sauce the recipe requires, nor the oil for the stir frying.  I suspect the predominant ingredient in the mix is cornstarch, though the balance of flavors is pleasant.  My experience with this mix was much better than the Sweet and Sour Seasoning, and I'd probably purchase this one again.

review/summary: Simply Delish!!
review/text: I tried this sauce on a whim, when I saw it in Whole Foods Market. It had a local label and I'm all 'gung ho' for trying out products made locally. I wasn't sure what to expect so I tasted a little bit before mixing it with my other ingredients, and was initially surprised that it truly tasted like its name as well as very authentic. But boy was I surprised after I used this with a stuffed shells recipe and really tasted the flavors! The flavoring of the herbs in the sauce were simply robust and just delicious, complimenting my other ingredients extremely well. I vowed never to buy commercial pasta sauces ever again, but this certainly changed my mind. This is very close to making a sauce from scratch, in my opinion. If you're skeptical, I would suggest buying a jar from your local health food store before buying in bulk...you won't regret it!

review/text: I used to happily feed these to my pugs, but the last time I found a dime-sized metal shard in the bag.<br />I was very disappointed because my dogs loved these treats.  I will be switching brands.<br />I emailed Merrick customer service, including photos, but they refused to contact me.  I have filed a report with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)<br />I'm not one of those crazy people who wastes time filing reports (I have never done that before) & writing negative reviews for no reason.  I am very concerned with the health & well-being of animals (especially my own) & I believe this product poses a threat.
