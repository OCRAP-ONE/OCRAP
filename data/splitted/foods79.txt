review/summary: Wonderful if you can handle salt
review/text: I was delighted to be able to order these, since local stores no longer carry them.  The bags contain what appear to be chips of pork skin that were parboiled in salt water, then flattened under high pressure.  Be sure to shake them around to distribute them throughout the bag before cooking.  They expand considerably in the bag during 1:00 to 2:00 of nuking, depending on the wattage, etc., but it is a slow expansion, unlike the vigorous popping of corn.  Also, the bag  only expands about half as much as with popcorn.  When ready, these resemble the ones available in cellophane bags that were deep-fried, but these are far tastier, fresher, AND MUCH LOWER IN FAT AND CALORIES.  A whole bag is 210 calories, about 50 calories from fat.  This is less than the low-fat microwave popcorn I use.  One bag, however, has 50% of the daily salt limit for an adult.<br /><br />I especially like these sprinkled with garlic powder and dried marjoram (together).  Other herbs and spices are interesting variations, such as sage or cumin or whatever else might appeal to you.

review/summary: Yummy, fresh pork rinds!
review/text: I love it, less than two minutes in the microwave and you have hot, crispy and fresh (key here...some of the already puffed ones in stores are stale) chicharrones, or pork rinds.  I found these on a health food site and couldn't believe it, so I ordered a box.  They are really yummy and as long as you don't overindulge, you should enjoy them every time you are seeking something crunchy and salty (and low in carbs!).

review/summary: Amazingly Good!
review/text: I do not like pre-cooked pork rinds, not even made fresh in the Mexican Carnecerias, but hubby likes them, so I decided to buy these.<br /><br />I was shocked to find that they were light, airy and crispy. Some bags were saltier than others, but we've cooked up about 5 so far and the majority aren't overly salty.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned watching them to figure out how long the cooking time should be. In our 1100 watt oven 40-43 seconds seems to be just right.<br /><br />The key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated. Leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy.<br /><br />Since I follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons, I like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs. I'm still trying to come up with more dip ideas that will go well with the flavoring.<br /><br />I wish they'd put out a version that didn't have seasoned salt as I'd like them with just salt and/or garlic.

review/summary: Great snack
review/text: These are an interesting and tasty alternative to microwave popcorn, well worth trying. The spicy version is not very spicy, but has a little kick. Be careful to even out the contents of the bag before microwaving and to make sure the bag rotates freely in microwaves with a turntable. Microwave time is short, about 90 seconds. They come out hot and fresh tasting. Pieces are relatively small, about an inch square. They have a less intense pork flavor than the best pork rinds, but having them hot helps compensate. Amazingly, pork rinds are becoming "diet food." They have no carbs, there is a lot of air in them that minimizes the calories for the volume, and relatively small quantities are satisfying. Anyway, it is a good story to go with a tasty snack.

review/text: I bought these for my dad and husband, who are doing the Atkin's diet. They love them! I live in New Jersey, so pork rinds are not that popular. I describe them to people as Funyuns texture with bacon flavor. They are very tasty, and calorie-wise, you get alot of bang for your buck. They are quite salty, however, which is not a downside for my family.

review/text: If you like pork rinds, then you absolutely must try these.  These are pork rinds that basically pop like pop corn in the microwave.  There is nothing quite like a fresh and hot pork rind.  The original flavor is great and so is the spicy, but the spicy can be a little hot.  I will never buy premade pork rinds again because of these.

review/summary: Not just another pretty reheat
review/text: Microwave pork rinds?  Figured it was just a bag of the guilty pleasures heated up to add taste appeal.  So I popped a bag into the microwave and surprise!  The bag popped back!  It even puffed up like Orville Reddenbacher's best.  All that in less than 90 seconds.<br /><br />Turns out the little treats are bagged raw and freeze-dried and they actually cook and puff up in the microwave.  The difference between these guys and an off the shelf bag is the difference between bagged and freshly popped pop corn.  And since they're cooked without frying or oil they are -- dare we say -- healthy?  Well, maybe not raw carrots, but a third of a bag total out at 60 calories and 2 grams of fat.<br /><br />Not so guilty a pleasure after all.

review/text: I bought this out of curiosity after seeing it on the Food Network.  It does taste good.  You do have to carefully follow the directions on the bag.  This doesn't work the same as microwave popcorn.  The "bake" time is quite short, and overcooked pork rinds aren't pretty or tasty.  I think that in the future, if I want warm pork rinds, I'll try warming up a small batch of my usual brand in the toaster oven for a couple of minutes.

review/summary: good, not great
review/text: I have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle. Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.<br /><br />I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.<br /><br />Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy. Just salty.

review/text: They're ok I guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it. You'll find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent. Also, no matter what you set the timer on the microwave, you will have little burn/hardened pieces. So you're not even getting a whole lot out of one bag.

review/summary: Great snack alternative...particularly good with beer.
review/text: These are a great alternative to your usual "par-for-the-course" snacks as well as traditional, bagged pork rinds. I had the same issues with some of the others who've bought them in that finding out how long to microwave them with your particular microwave is a trial and error process on the first bag or two. On my first attempt, they "fluffed-up" fine, but I ended up microwaving them too long and some of them started to scorch (leaving a bad burnt smell, though not quite as bad as popcorn when the same thing happens). Spreading them out inside the bag before you start to microwave them is probably the single most important thing you can do. It's a little tricky, but you can get them to move around a bit with minimal effort. If you just throw the bag in the microwave as if it's popcorn, you won't get a quality product, but if you take the time to spread them out (as stated on the bag) and then watch the bag until it stops expanding (again, stated on the bag), they're quite good.<br /><br />Once you get the hang of it, the Bacon Curls are pretty delicious, especially paired with a beer or two (something pale and drinkable, from a "yard work" kind of beer to something like an IPA). The curls/rinds are light and fluffy, but very crunchy (surprisingly so, I was halfway expecting there to be some kind of greasy sogginess, but there isn't). They're on the salty side, but again, with the beer, that's a good thing. I like how they come out of the package sizzling and popping a bit, warm (not hot) and delicious. If you already like pork rinds, then this is almost a no brainer, as this is the same thing, only better (fresh, warm, delicious and with less fat).

review/text: ...but I love these things!  Bagged pork rinds from the grocery are beyond disgusting.  They don't look, smell or taste appealing.  But fresh nuked pork rinds are a very different story.  These pigskins come out toasty and, dare I say it?  Delicious!  Significantly lighter and more airy than their grocery store counterparts.  "They" say you can use them to scoop up salsa or dip, but they're very good on their own, and I think the porky taste wouldn't go well with salsa anyway.  Maybe french onion dip - I'll have to try that.<br /><br />These pork rinds seemed fairly salty to me.  But when I crave chips and such, it's usually the salt (and crunch) that I'm really after, so it wasn't a problem.  Microwaving pork rinds - who knew?

I've actually ordered 7 cases for myself and my sons.  We're thrilled.  You'll never want any other pork rinds after you've tasted these!

review/summary: Great product, BUT!
review/text: Great product, BUT!!!!! It's a little tricky to figure out the best time needed for YOUR microwave oven. Ours is pretty strong, and 1 minute 40 to 50 seconds is about right. However, BE WARNED! If you have an inexpensive or "low power" oven, the results will be very poor at best. (Just ask the crew where I work) When I tried to make a bag in the company cheap oven, it was SUPER slow to expand, and after the better part of 4 minutes, the burnt smell forced then to keep the door to the break room open for the rest of the afternoon! Bottom line....if you don't have a quality oven, don't buy these. One last word. After you remove the bag from the oven, carefully open, shake, and simply blow on them until they stop crackling. Otherwise they will seem stale until they cool. All this sounds like a pile of work, but after the first couple bags, you will NEVER buy pork rinds at the store again. I get a discount on the price because I have a box sent automatically every month. Works out to just under $13.00 a box with free shipping. Enjoy!

review/summary: Unhappy for the first time.
review/text: I've bought this product many times and this time (11/10) they are old or defective.  The bags don't puff up and rinds are flat, stale & burn when cooked.  I've tried different time settings and in different microwaves.<br /><br />I'm very dissapointed as this is a product I've been ordering for years.  Guess I'll have to call them and complain.

review/summary: Good snack
review/text: I have also tried the regular Lowrey's microwavable rinds, and both are good!  I love that they can sit on the shelf for weeks and then be microwaved quickly into a warm snack.  The hot and spicy isn't overdone - there is some heat, but you can still taste the rinds.  The heat is just enough to slow you down so you don't consume the whole bag in less than five minutes.<br /><br />I also love to hear the crackle sound when you pull them from the microwave.  It adds to the experience.  :)

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: These pork rinds are a great alternative to the bagged variety in the stores.  Out of the microwave in less than 2 minutes they are warm and have a great smoky flavor.  Follow the directions, making sure you shake the bag horizontally to distribute the pieces as evenly as possible.  Watch the bag.  If you have a powerful microwave like I do-past 1600-it will take less than 2 minutes.  The little pop and crackling noise when I pour them out reminds me of pop rocks!  They are a great low carb snack.

review/summary: Hooh Weee!  Pork Rinds from a Microwave!  Y'all gotta try these!
review/text: Pork rinds are the delicacy of the South and among various Latin American, Carribean and Asian Cultures.<br /><br />My friends introduced to me the fastest way to cure my cravings...Microwave Pork Rinds.  I was a little skeptical, at first, but since I ain't too picky when it comes to eatin', I said, "OK."<br /><br />Just put the package into the microwave and 2 minutes later, you're about to feast on fresh tasting crispy pork rinds.  Be careful when you take them out of the microwave, though.  They're hotter than a Coal Miner in the Month of June.  You can see the steam emanating from the package, and they're cracklin' hot.  But, Guys and Gals, this is the real deal!  They're crispy and Oh, Sooooo good, that you'll be heating up another package before you know it.<br /><br />Now, I can get them and eat them when traveling (as long as I have a microwave readily available).<br /><br />This innovation is as good as microwave tater tots.<br /><br />Mmmmm Mmmmm, Good!

review/summary: It's like popcorn for Low Carb dieters
review/text: I'm on a low carb diet, and it's very difficult to resist temptation when my family has freshly popped popcorn.  Now I have found the solution.  Lowry's Microwavable Pork Rinds pop in the microwave exactly like popcorn, and only 1 carb per serving!  Plus, I love the way the curls keep making the popping sound in my mouth as I eat them... like Pop Rocks candy!  I got the regular which is salted just enough for my taste.  I also eat them with salsa as a snack (which replaces chips). Crumbled on a salad is a great replacement for croutons. Thank you Lowry's for coming up with a product that is such a life-saver to my diet!

review/text: These microwave pork rinds are quite tasty for them to be cooked in the microwave!  My husband and I love the hot & spicy flavor better than the plain because it has more flavor.  The only drawback I see to these is that if you have an older microwave or one that is not as powerful (at least 1100 watts), the pork rinds do not cook as well.

review/summary: Great quick snack
review/text: I have been eating these for years. They are quick to microwave, tasty and not terribly bad for you.<br />I first found them about 10 years ago on a local grocery store shelf. Soon after, they were gone from the stores for some reason. Found them on Amazon a few of years ago, and have been ordering them ever since. Always good.<br />Tip: Make sure you store them at a reasonable temperature. I let some get too warm in my luggage, and they sort of spoiled before I could micriwave them.

review/text: I like the taste of these but they are inconsistent in texture (some are really really hard, while others are what you would expect).  You have to be careful with the microwaving part, but even when you are, it's hard to get consistent results. They also could be a little spicier for my taste.

review/summary: Great Taste-Tricky procedure
review/text: These pork skins have a great taste. Very fresh "homemade" taste. The cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though. I have a 1000w microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag. The first bag I tried with 1 minute, and additional 15 second intervls, stopping at 1min, 15 seconds. Several skins had not yet cooked. So I rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it 15 more seconds. Still some did not fully "explode" or "bloom".  The second bag I started with 1 minute, 30 seconds. Slightly better results, but again I needed to re-roll the end of the bag and give it another 15-30 seconds, still using the 15 second intervals for best results.  The third bag I started with 2 minutes (which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting) and the results were not as good. Too many had over-cooked and were too hard to eat.<br />My suggestion would be to stick with the 1 minute with 15 second intervals, listening closely to the sound. (They emit a slight hissing sound when they expand).  As soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it's a good sign you have reached the optimal result.  This item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store, but the improved flavor is worth it. To me anyway.  The jury is still out on whether the "healthy" claim can hold water.  I will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion.  Good Eats!

review/summary: Micro pork rinds freshest you can buy.
review/text: When I saw the price of the pork rinds plus free shipping, and since I had never tried the micro rinds before I decided I would give it a try. I ordered a box of the Spicy and one of the Original.<br />They were here in no time.<br />We have a 1000 watt micro and we experimented a couple of times and found that 92 seconds was perfect for us. If we have a few that do not puff up (which rarely happens) you can put the few on a paper plate and put them back in the micro and it takes just a few seconds for them to puff up.<br />Because I am not a spicy food lover I wasn't as crazy about the Spicy as the Original but my husband loved them. So that made it possible for each of us to have a box of our own. Wahoo, I didn't have to share with him. Worked out great.<br />I would liked to have had a little less salt on them but was able to knock some off just by tapping the rind on the plate as I ate them.<br /><br />I would give this an excellent rating, in fact I am going to order 2 more boxes after I finish this.

review/summary: Great diet snack also
review/text: Great taste no carbs (I am diabetic) and low cal also. Only drawback may be sodium content. When you need a cracker for a dip I use them. I just make the dip from fat free sour cream and onion soup mix. The dip has more cal than the pork rinds. I n short they are a cracker substitute for me.<br /><br />Most complaints are  improper  cooking  results. Hate to say this but it is your microwave not the product. There are microwave ovens that have a real bad hot spot and this burns them. I had an oven like this (older model)and the problem went away with  the new  microwave.<br /><br />But the biggest thing in their favor is the taste. Love both kinds.

It was great to find them (and for a reasonable price) at Amazon.<br /><br />I know, I know... they're junk food.  However, compared to the pork rinds you'd buy in a bag, the microwave version is considerably lower in fat.  As far as flavors go, I prefer the "Hot & Spicy"; it's a lot more interesting than "Regular".<br /><br />Suggestion:  Eat them while they're still warm, they're much better that way!

review/text: You need to make sure the pieces are evenly distributed throughout the bag before you microwave it. With my microwave I find 1:30 on high is the best, shake bag well when you first pull it out (for at least 10 seconds). This ensures the hot and spicy seasoning to be evenly coated. Then enjoy, I eat em with a beer.

review/summary: TERRIFIC FOOD FIND!!
review/text: SO excited about this food find that i've already e-mailed 100+ friends and family about it!<br /><br />in the past i would buy a bag of chicharron when i craved a taste - and eat at most 1/4 of it .. then when i needed a bit to top a savory filipino dish (pancit palabok or monggo), i'd find the bag had gone stale so i'd toss the bag and buy a new one to begin another cycle of wastefulness.<br /><br />Lowrey's Microwave Pork Rinds to the rescue!! .. in 2 minutes or less, each bag produces crisp, not greasy, tasty chicharron - about 3? cups at a time, the perfect amount for me .. oh, and the expiration date on these bags is june 2011 so i'm set for at least a year, for $13 (in the past i've thrown out maybe one $3 bag per month?).<br /><br />my mr. science hubby is so amazed with this product he's taking a bag to work today to show his techie guys (one is south american and gives us those huge chicharrones fried in a vat of oil by his mother-in-law; the other is muslim and doesn't eat pork ;-).

review/summary: The best pork rinds you will ever eat unless you own a BBQ restaurant..
review/text: Wow. It's amazing how so simple a snack can be so tasty. I wanted something crunchy that wasn't a carb. You might want to eat only bland veggies the rest of the day because it is high in fat and sodium. But a great guilty pleasure nonetheless.

review/summary: Tastes like feet!
review/text: I normally rate whatever items I buy but rarely offer words of advice. Well, these things changed my mind. I love pork rinds. Usually I buy a tub of them from Sam's, but since I'm the only one in the house who eats them, they go stale long before I can make a dent in them. So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, "Hey, that's the perfect solution!". It's a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds.<br /><br />I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth. I'm still shuddering from it. If you like the taste of feet, go for it. If not, I'd suggest heading to Sam's to buy the wonderful tasting pork rinds we all know and love.

review/summary: Lawrey's Microwave Pork rinds review
review/text: The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.

review/summary: Tasted Like Ammonia!
review/text: So I made one bag of these pork rinds & it came out good! I decided to try another & the taste was unbelievable - it had an ammoniated taste & smell to it! I thought that maybe it was a bad bag. I stayed away for a few weeks & decided to give them another try. BAD IDEA! They tasted like ammonia again! This wasn't caused by incorrect cooking time because they all came out looking puffy, and crispy. I ended up throwing the box out.

review/summary: NOT EDIBLE - MSG - EXCESSIVE SALT
review/text: A warning should be placed on the item description because this product contains Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), a dangerous excitotoxin which is problematic for many people. There is no indication in the item description that this is the case. I fully agree with another reviewer that this item also is so extremely salty that it cannot be consumed. The MSG also heightens the very salty taste. This item did puff up very nicely in the microwave, but it was inedible because of the saltiness and all 18 packages had to be thrown out. For that reason, I am surprised at the many excellent reviews of this product. Amazon.com gets an A+++ for their wonderful handling of this problem.

review/summary: High MSG content, but otherwise a great low carb/fat snack
review/text: I was surprised at how well the rinds "popped," and didn't have any difficulties as other reviewers did.  I made sure that I unfolded the package (it's folded into three just like a microwave popcorn pack), unbent the folds so that the product could move between the three areas, then I shook it vigorously several times, trying to distribute the contents somewhat evenly throughout the bag.  Two minutes in my microwave (1100 Watts, but 10 years old) is perfect, and virtually all rinds pop every time.<br /><br />This is a low fat product, so it isn't nearly as tasty as the supermarket pork rinds you may have tried.  One could easily eat an entire package, although there are three servings per bag, but you will pay the consequences in terms of salt intake and MSG overload.  The MSG triggered a migraine for me, so now I don't eat it frequently, and make sure I only consume half a bag at most.  When I get near the bottom of the bag, where the most salt and MSG ends up, I try to brush off as much as I can.<br /><br />Still, a good snack option for those with blood sugar sensitivities.  Zero carbs is always good! The only reason for my 4 star review is that the amount of MSG per bag seems to be pretty high, and that's not disclosed on the product's Amazon page.

review/text: I bought these on another online site and the Amazon ones are almost $3 cheaper. I love these. In fact, I've grown quite addicted. Unfortunatley, they have tons of sodium and also contain MSG, which is causing me to gain a lb or two of water weight and stalls my weight loss progress very effectively. If I were only trying to maintain, these wouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />I won't buy them again, for these reasons.

review/text: I bought these last month as part of an Amazon promotion - buy 5 items get %40 percent off.  I had never heard of this product, but have a soft spot in my belly for the snacks I grew up on as a kid.  These things turned out way better than expected.  They are essentially pork rinds from your typical supermarket, but they are fresh - still crackling and popping after you open the bag.  I'm addicted to these now and have had to ratio them out so I don't eat them every night.  They're THAT good.

review/text: The product itself is great, it's the bag that needs work.  I recommend that instead of microwaving them in the bag, spread them out on a paper plate or a microwave safe plate then popping them in the microwave for about 90 seconds.  You do have to watch these cook though or they will burn on you. I really like the pork rinds themselves and they are a healthy alternative to chips though they are a little salty.

review/summary: I LIKE 'em
review/text: I like them a lot. Got a batch after seeing it on a TV show. The first bag seemed a little 'off' to me, but then I realized it was bacause they were not fried. After that I like them a lot. I think they could be 'hotter'. I found that you want to start at the low end of the cooking time and work up. For me about 3 bags was enough to figure out that 1:08 was the 'perfect' time for my microwave. Long enough that they all 'pop' but not so long that anything happens to the early 'poppers'.<br /><br />My daughter loves them also, and we are going through them at a pretty good clip. I'm going to put them on auto reorder when this batch is gone. They are perfect for evening snacking when the mood hits. Since you make them as you eat them, never a stale bag! And the size is just about perfect for that.<br /><br />That's my 2 cents worth :)

review/summary: You have to be really desperate
review/text: After reading all the positive reviews, I was really looking forward to finally getting a very low carb (somewhat low calorie) snack that I can work into my low carb living.  I've had pork rinds from the stores and thought they were pretty good, so I expected this to be at or better than my local convenience store brand.  Wrong.  I was first disappointed with the texture.  After following the instructions to microwave from 1-2 minutes, some (about 1/4) were crispy, but the rest were almost like taffy and would stick to the teeth?  Perhaps I didn't cook long enough, so 2nd bag stayed in longer which made a few more crispy, but more burnt and chewy ones.  But texture is only 1/2 the problem, the biggest issue was that the product taste like the bag. The taste of the microwave bag seems to bake into the product giving them a paper bag taste.  Finally,those without the full paper bag taste didn't really have a lot of flavor.  They were salty (which is to be expected),but that's really all the flavor you get.  So if your desperate and too lazy to get out a store (or can't find any in a near by store), this may work for you.  It  works out to about $1.00 a bag, so I'm not totally disappointed as my dog loves them.  By the way, my dog gives them 5 stars.
