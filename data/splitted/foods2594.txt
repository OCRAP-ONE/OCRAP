review/text: I have used these little treats for our 2 dogs for a while and never had a problem.  This time the container arrived a little dented and when I opened it, discovered that the inside pouch had been damaged and the greenies are stuck together.  Disappointing.

review/text: My dog is not wild about many treats but she loves Greenies.  She just can't resist them.  She never eats the cat's food, but once I had some cat Greenies in the bowl and she scarffed them up!  The only reason I gave them 4 stars is that I wish they weren't so expensive.

review/summary: Great Deal!!
review/text: Our dogs adore these and they are usually fairly pricey for the amount you get. However Amazon always has one great deal or another for buying these and significantly cheaper than in store prices.<br /><br />We usually buy the 130 or 96 pack of 'Teenies' for our two chihuahua mix dogs (depending whichever has the better sale price at the time.<br /><br />The teenie size is great for our smaller dog (6lb) as he can fully chew on it and savor it. However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs. However I would not use Greenies solely to keep a dogs breath in check, I recommend getting some other product for that.

review/text: My dogs love these greenies. Their teeth are super white from chewing on them and their breath somehow is no longer as stinky. The only thing is that they are a tad-overpriced, so I recommend buying them in bulk if you are truly satisfied with this product like I am.

review/summary: Greenies are awesome!!
review/text: My dogs go crazy for these!! I was worried for their safety since I had heard some negative reviews for these chews, so I did some research and found that the most common problem is from choking.  They do chomp them down so I have them eat it while I'm nearby in case they choke (haven't yet).  Their teeth and gums are clean and strong so that saves $$ on dental bills.  I don't like the idea of having them go under general anesthesia just to get their teeth cleaned (seems much riskier), so I will continue to take the "risk" with Greenies. Amazon price for these, even with shipping costs, are still the lowest. And my dogs get to bark at the FedEx guy!!

review/text: I have a 10 month old puppy. She is a mix between 1/4 poodle, chihuahua, terrier, and maltese. She is SUPER picky with treats and food in general and she absolutely loves these!! She wants one all the time! Her bowel movements are not affected by them in a negative way. The only thing I would say that is a con is that they don't last very long! She eats them pretty quickly even though the material of them is pretty rock solid and her mouth is tiny.

review/text: I have two dogs and they both love this it. I've been giving them this treat for over a year now and had no issues. The only reason why I give it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because it does not help my dogs with their minor tartar build up like it's supposed to. Other than that, it's a great treat.

review/text: I got these for the "health" benefits of fresh breath, plaque and overall quality of stuff. I like to treat my kids now and again and they love them so much they have even taken to identifying these treats as "greenies"! Yes I know it is typically the tone but they even get excited if you say the word green now, its crazy. So I'd say, get these for your kids they will love them so much you'll have a hard time denying them at least one a day. I know I do.

review/summary: Squeaky clean!!
review/text: I have a one year old Pomeranian whom has been on greenies since she was about 3mos. Let me tell you, I've gone to the vet several times during her first year for different reasons. The first time her vet was happy to see that she had a healthy "smile" and hoped it continued, she was still a puppy. Since then, we moved to another city and she now has a different vet. This vet was so excited, and YES i said EXCITED, to see my fur baby's gums and teeth. The vet asked to take a picture of Foxy's(my fur baby) teeth to post on their website. She asked me if i brush them daily. I said nope, we've been using greenies does that count?? She said YES and added, in detail, how healthy it is for them in A LOT of aspects. Buying them from a pet store is ridiculous to me because the price for a pack of 20 is over $19. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So when i saw this price and the amt that come in the pack, I've been buying them on here ever since!! I give them to her once a day EVERYDAY at 9pm. She even recognizes the word "greenies" and follows me to the pantry when it's that time of day for her. Because of a previous review i read about storing them in the container it comes in for a while caused maggots, i got really grossed out(has NEVER happened to me) so JUST IN CASE, i dump them in a snap seal, clear, plastic container.

review/text: I have a bichon beagle hybrid mix (called a glechon).  He just loves greenies. We just had him into his vet for his checkup and the vet told us that his teeth were beautiful. He wanted to know what we did to keep them that way. The only thing we do is to give him greenies. I've had two other people comment on his teeth in the past month. I highly recommend these treats for your dog if you want him to have good teeth and breath. We've never had trouble with him being able to digest them. They are a little costly but I feel they're well worth the extra cost.

review/text: It's reassuring that the treats I give my precious Yorkie are of the best quality and of course I appreciate the cost effectiveness of dealing with a reputable company.  Amazon has provided swift service and a product that would cost much more from a local pet shop.  Greenies are good for my dog's dental health and are not dangerous as are rawhides or toys with squeeking mechanisms which can choke a dog.  Just the sight of the Greenie box, and she knows it's nap time or time for a treat.

review/text: My veterinarian recommended these.  My dog is a German Shepherd, Pit Bull, Jack Russel mix.  His top part is huge but his legs- not so much.  Basically he needs his weight managed all the time because we don't want knee problems to develop.  At his last trip Dr. Kragness said he had a bit of a tartar problem (organic food related) and to try a greenie a day.  Well he's been chewing them for about 12 days and his teeth look great and as an added benefit his breath is clean, still hot but clean smelling.  In addition I've noticed that he doesn't have a lot of doggy gas like usual.  I thought the price was a bit steep but tried them on the word of the vet and for the obvious results we're getting I guess you get what you pay for here.

review/text: My dog is in love with these treats. He comes running when I say, "Do you want a greeny?" Then he takes it under the bed to devour it. My dog's teeth and breath stay healthy due to his greenies in between brushings. Nice to get such a big box at this great price.

review/text: I like to buy Greenies for my dog but they are very expensive even in multi-packs. If you purchase at online pet stores they are somewhat less expensive but not like the boxes offered on Amazon.  Dogs need clean teeth and healthy gums and Greenies will take care of both.  Easily digestible for my 13 year old Shi-Tzu.

review/summary: A teethsaver!
review/text: About two years ago I adopted a little toy poodle from my local humane society.  She had been rescued from a puppy mill and was underweight, coated in fleas and had a broken jaw.  After trying to fix the jaw with a metal plate and it getting infected, we ended up having her lower left jaw along with all of her teeth on that sound of her mouth removed completely.  A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts "dancing" on her two back legs.  The last time I took her into the vet, they said she only had Grade 1 Dental Disease as opposed to the Grade 3 the year before -  Thank you Greenies for creating a delicious product that is helping to save my dog's few precious teeth!  Thank you Amazon for offering them at an affordable price with free shipping!

review/summary: Our dog loves them, but eats them FAST!
review/text: We bought these for our 65 lb golden retriever. He is not a powerful chewer since he has a retriever's mouth, but he is a diligent chewer. He'll chew and keep chewing once he gets going. The size of the large-sized Greenies seems right for him.<br /><br />Our dog's breath was getting stinky and we were noticing some buildup of plaque, so we got the Greenies Dental Treats. He simply loves these. But he eats them a little to fast. They only last a few minutes. I wish he would chew more and swallow less!<br /><br />But our dogs breath does seem better. We don't use them every day, more like every other day to make them last, but they still seem to do some decent teeth cleaning. I would use these in combination with other teeth/gum health products like the Nylabones and raw hides.

review/summary: Sticky, but delicious.
review/text: My Pug puppies absolutely love these bones.  The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing "digestive upset" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case.

review/text: Received the Petite Lite Greenies 27 oz box today.  The picture shows a count of 96 bones, but I only got a box of 45.  I realize that the picture shows the Teenie size w/96 and 27oz, so naturally the next size up Petite would have fewer bones, but I think receiving only 45 is a bit deceiving.  45 bones for almost $25 isn't bad, but I won't be purchasing on a regular basis.  These are for a Christmas gift, so they are a splurge anyway!  My dogs, a Chihuahua, MinPin and Shichon love them!

review/summary: For sparkling doggy teeth
review/text: Of all the dog teeth treats, I bought this one because it was highly recommended by doggie dentists. If your dog doesn't take to it right away, have some patience. My own dog took it in strides at first--she would chew on it but not swallow it. And now she looks forward to it more than any other little treat. I don't know what it does for her breath (which is never very minty fresh), but her teeth are sparkling white. Giving her one a day doesn't make her stomach hurt in any way.

review/text: I've been giving my dogs Greenies for years now.  Their excitement at receiving this treat never abates.  As expensive as they are, I feel my animals are well worth it.  This is doggie health food at its finest.  And the price here on Amazon is the best I've found to date.  However, I am completely disgusted with the packaging of this product.  The huge box is wasteful and not at all environmentally sound.  Come on Greenies people - put the product in a pouch and call it a day.

review/summary: Work great!
review/text: My Italian greyhound LOVES these treats, and I've yet to notice any problems as described by so many other reviewers. My Bella (her name) gets one of these treats about every other day since she's very difficult when it comes to me actually brushing her teeth. They definitely do the job.<br /><br />Some people have stated that their dog has choked on these treats or a piece got caught in their intestinal track. Well, I'm not sure how fast your dog tends to eat treats, or how big of a chunk they try to bite off, but that DOES matter when it comes to digestion of anything. My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down. The person at Petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs. While I can believe that, my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day. If I gave her this for everything, I could see it becoming an issue.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are great, they help to keep my dogs mouth clean so that I'm not having to brush her teeth quite as much.

review/text: Molly and Cocoa, our cocker spaniels, said to tell you that they love these greenies and can't think of anything they would rather munch on.  They have sizes just right for them, are easy to chew and easy to digest.  The fact that they come in "lite" is a bonus as it helps us keep their calorie content down in the winter when they don't get as much exercise.  I would highly recommend greenies for a great treat that helps clean dog's teeth and eliminate bad breath.

review/text: I have an Old English Sheepdog puppy who was developing inflamed gums and awful dog breath way younger than he should have been.  I started feeding him these, and within a very short time (weeks?  Maybe even less), the inflammation had gone away and his breath was much better.  I buy a size smaller than recommended for his size, and that way he can have more than one -- it breaks the treat up.  Since he loves these, I can use them as a reward.  Next box, I'm going to buy an even smaller size so I can divide the treat up even more throughout the day.

review/summary: Turned her teeth around
review/text: When we adopted our 6 year old Basset Hound from a foster home, her back teeth had so much build up that they were actually brown.  Now after four months, they are not completely back, but they are about 75% better. Although they are not inexpensive, I think they do a good job.  And she also enjoys them very much.  I have checked many places and have found Amazons prices to be the best so far.

review/summary: Dogs devour them, does it clean their teeth?
review/text: I have two dogs, 22 pounds and 45 pounds. Got the large size which is supposed to be for 50-100 lbs. My dogs love these things. I mean within a few short minutes they are gone. I thought they would be a little more of a challenge. I guess the big question is are they in my dogs mouth long enough to actually do any teeth cleaning? Or are they just a delicious treat for my dogs to enjoy?

review/summary: Our dog loves Greenies
review/text: Our old dog has dental problems and arthritis.  She LOVES her Greenies and reminds us that she "deserves" one a day.  Since starting on her "senior" Greenies, she is much more limber and agile.  She has also started chewing on her chew sticks again (after several years of not being interested in them...and yes, we take her to the vet to have her teeth cleaned).

review/summary: The only way to go, unless money is not an issue!
review/text: Our three dogs love Greenies. They are very expensive (usually $32.99, but marked down to $29.99 sometimes). Then, on top of that you have state tax. So ... if I buy 4 boxes: two Petite and two Teenies in a store that has "Pet" as part of the name, it'll cost me over $135.00. If I do the same thing through Amazon companies prices it costs me about $85.00. That's a difference of $50.00 (for the Math impaired reader ...). Go with free shipping because it, literally, gets here the same time frame. Use the $50.00 and take your spouse out to dinner!<br />The product is great. I did notice that two in the same day was a bit tough on my Pomeranian's digestive system and caused a little diarrhea. The dogs love the taste and would eat them all the time. We get the small ones despite having two larger dogs because they will chomp them down in a heartbeat. With the smaller sizes the dogs still get a treat and the boxes have a lot larger amount of Greenies in them.

This was the first time I ordered them on amazon and I'm glad I did.  I got the lowest price ever and they were delivered the fastest.

review/summary: Our dogs' favorite!
review/text: When my dogs see me reaching for the Greenie box they immediately sit on their bottoms and behave wonderfully. One of the dogs will even do a little dance when we finally give her the treat. We give our dogs one greenie about every other day and they just love them. They take a lot of time in carefully chewing the greenie, so it doesn't appear they are swallowing them too quickly. I usually get the Petite or Teeny varieties for our two 10 lb dogs, but since they like them so much I moved to regular. Hopefully I'll see a change in their breath soon as they hate getting their teeth brushed.

review/summary: My Dog Likes Them!
review/text: Got the teenie greenies for my 16 1/2lb Shih Tzu- Lhasa Apso.  The package says that these are for dogs that range 5-15lbs, but I ordered them anyway (trying to save some money).  She loves them.  Gobbles them up straight away.<br /><br />Only advice-Stick to the poundage recommendation.  These treats are so small that I doubt my dog is getting the benefits of tartar control/removal.  On the bright side, she likes the taste, so they certainly work as regular daily treats.

review/text: My dog loves these things, and I love that you can get almost 100 for about $20, if you went to a pet store you'd be paying at least twice as much for these things.  I have a Yorkie, and I only give these to her every so often (I try to remember to give one every other day so she doesn't get fatter).  I really hope that Amazon keeps them this cheap and I'll keep buying them

review/text: My little dog loves Greenies chews! We were first introduced to this dental treat at our vet's office and seeing how much Toby loved them I decided to start buying them for him. Imagine how surprised I was finding out the price at the pet store! When I saw this fabulous deal on Amazon for 96 Greenies I was thrilled. This will be Toby's favorite present under the tree for certain. As always, great fast service and even greater buys through Amazon.

review/summary: Dogs gone wild!
review/text: I have no idea what is in these but my wire hair terrier goes wild when the box comes out.  My daughter started me on these and he just loves them.  Had to get the small chew so he does not get fat on them as they are loaded with calories.  Checked with my vet and they had no problem with them, use for own dogs.  Only problem is once you start your dog on these it will be a continuous treat and even from Amazon these are not cheap.  As quickly as they are devoured the per minute price is astronomical.  But it is hard to deprive a dog you love of such a tasty treat!

review/text: or really my dog loves them.  When I have a busy day and I am too tired to brush her teeth, I just give her one of these instead and they do as they describe:  keep her teeth clean.  They are very soft and easy on her teeth but also rub the leftovers off to keep them clean.  I really recommend these to anybody who has a dog and they also make cat greenies which also work for my barn cats and they love them.
