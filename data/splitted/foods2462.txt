review/summary: this brand is best for tomato-based sauces
review/text: I agree with the other poster that this is the best crushed tomato product in a can. They use good quality tomatoes so they don't need to add anything else. Check the ingredient list. It's just tomatoes. I've only purchased this product at the grocery store, however. Pomi is equally great and supposedly better for you because it is in a box, but it is much more expensive.

review/summary: Delicious Decaf!
review/text: This coffee is soooooooo good! I bought it after I started experiencing heartburn from my over consumption of regular coffee. So in the AM, I have a 20 oz. regular, then the 16 oz decaf. If you get heartburn, this is a good choice.....I would defy anyone to tell it's decaf. I bought mine @ TJ Maxx @ a steal! Don't know why it was so low priced.....possibly due to the May best buy date.....I bought in March, or that it was in the old blue print bag? Don't know, but I got one 12oz bag of the whole bean and even bought a cheap coffee grinder for it. After trying it, went back and bought 3 more bags.....wish now, that I would have bought a case. The price was phenominal - ending up being .50/oz, compared to Starbuck's price of .81/oz and Amazon's price of .74/oz. I REALLY did get a great deal at TJ, but alas, that story's over. Amazon's price is good and this is where I'll order going forward, now that I'm hooked!

review/text: I've been roasting for three years now and I thought I would give this seller a try. I have had two different blends from them and have tried several roast profiles. This is not a very tasty espresso, and a pretty lousy drip coffee. I have found that most quality espresso blends can also make a decent to delicious cup of drip. This must have a high percentage of robusta. I would not buy again.<br /><br />Shipping was excellent.<br /><br />Check out Sweet Marias for superb quality green beans, unless mediocre is all you want - then by all means - buy this product.

review/summary: Really good, even with humble roasting
review/text: This is our first foray into roasting our own beans - and, I admit, done by accident. I put this bag in my cart when I was buying a number of varieties to see if I could get some good espresso from Amazon. It was with some serious humble equipment that I tried roasting first a small batch on the pan, then another small batch in the oven. The oven batch turned out much more even.<br /><br />Initially I wasn't impressed with the flavor but after leaving it for a day or two, it really came alive. This is really, really nice coffee. I'll look forward to roasting another batch and will continue receiving subscribed deliveries. The crema isn't spectacular, but I'd rather blame my poor, amateur roasting technique than the coffee. The flavor is GREAT.<br /><br />If you have the gumption to roast your own, give this a shot!

review/summary: ok coffe, I guess.
review/text: The beans are kind of small, but expend to normal size once roasted (unless they clog the roaster before they have the chance to fully expand).<br />Initially I've tried roasting them using cast iron pan.  The taste was ok, but I couldn't get the proper coffee smell.  After multiple tries I gave up and ordered a normal roaster, in hopes to eliminate the "user error".<br />The new roaster does make it easier and faster to roast, but everything else stayed about the same.  Not much of a smell and an ok taste.<br />May be I'll buy it again, but only after trying couple other brands to see if I can get something with the more aroma.

review/summary: My daughter is hooked on these...
review/text: My friend gave us a package of these that her son had outgrown.  We were using the Gerber banana puffs and I did not think our baby would like these Green puffs (Spinach, Collard Greens and Kale).  She does not like peas or green vegetables very much.  Boy was I wrong!  She loves these things.  They are by far her favorite (second favorite: Gerber Peach flavor).<br /><br />These are a great value here on Amazon especially if you do the subscribe & save.  The HappyBaby puffs give you 40% more puffs in a container than the Gerber variety, so consider that when purchasing.  These puffs are a little "poofier" - softer - than the Gerber variety and maybe a tiny bit larger.  Neither is bad or good, just an observation.  These are a big hit in my household, and I figure at least she's getting a few green vegetables in her diet somehow. :-)  I agree with the other reviewer that they kind of taste like a Cheerio, but you do get a bit of that vegetable taste on the "finish"...

review/text: We bought both the apple and green flavor of these, and I definitely like the concept.  I agree with the reviewer that said that the packaging leaves a lot to be desired.  The jar itself is great, and I love that they are BPA free, but the lid is a bit loose, and so it doesn't stay on well.  My 10 1/2 month old son loves the green flavor, but he wasn't so fond of the apple.  I tasted them to see if I could come up with a reason.  The "Green" puffs were more flavorful.  For this reason, I will probably not buy the apple again, but I will definitely buy the "Green" again.

review/summary: great first finger food/snack
review/text: These are a great first finger food/snack.  They were much easier for my child to dissolve in her mouth than the Gerber brand.  Not sure if it's that because there's a whole in the middle so there is not as much solid mass in her mouth, but she loved them immediately and had no gagging problem like she did with the other brands. And you get more in the package as well.  We've only tried the Greens and the Apple, but we've liked them and I like that they're organic.

review/text: these are just as tasty as gerber puffs but they are organic, half the sugar and just as affordable.  They really are! When I bought these, they were actually cheaper than gerber puffs if you take into consideration that each container holds more.  Also, this is a very eco-friendly company who uses recycled materials whenever possible. The container these come in is recycled from Target Method products and it is BPA free!

review/text: It is tasty and nutritious; whole grains, no corn; they have vitamin D; few baby foods do.<br />The bottle and cap are nice, does keep the product fresh unlike other brands.<br />And price is same or cheaper than the regular non-organic-junk fillers-finger food....so it is a no brainer.<br /> For some reason,my baby seems to like more the veggie one. Had no problem picking them up, and never choked on them (he did with others)<br /> My 3 year old also likes them.  And even though 6 bottles may seem a lot.........they go fast.  Expiration date was good (like seven months later).

I wasn't thrilled about having to order by the case, but I was having trouble finding these in local stores. But I know we'll end up using them over the years. And of course I found them at Target the day after I ordered.

review/text: My son has been taking the Happybaby cereal, and I was thrilled to know that they have started to make the puffs as well.  My son used to take the Gerber puffs but I have switched him to these organic ones.  He is OK with these.  However, I do not like the container as the cap opens too easily.  When my son throws the container or drops it, the cap opens and the puffs spill all over the floor.  We have wasted quite a fair bit of the puffs in this manner.

Maybe one in five tastes like styrofoam with a slight banana glaze. They do melt nicely in the mouth if you only eat one or two at a time, but if you shove a whole handful into your mouth, they dissolve into some sort of paste-like slag.<br /><br />Everyone's got different taste, and maybe my kid's just a little bit unusual, but these were a total flop. The only use we've gotten at all is using the container like a giant rattle.

review/summary: Sweet flavor instead of Greens flavor
review/text: I try to buy organic when I can. These puffs received great reviews, and advertise their low sugar content. The "Greens" flavor made me think that... they will taste like greens! It seemed like a great find.<br /><br />Greens-<br />Well, there might be "greens" in these puffs but you sure can't taste any of it.<br /><br />What do they taste like?<br />They taste sweet- an outer coating of sweetness, followed by a rice puff flavor. I do not agree with another reviewer who says that they are "just like Cheerios".<br /><br />Sugar content-<br />They might have only 0.5g of sugar per serving, but compared with Cheerios this is still double the sugar (those have 1 in 28g). Not that Cheerios are the measure for all baby snacks, and they are certainly not organic, but they are at least not sweet tasting.<br /><br />Packaging-<br />You will receive a box with six plastic dispensers similar to the ones you get for wipes. Each container contains 2.1 oz (60 g) of rice puffs. The containers are so light you could think they are empty. The packaging is complete overkill.<br /><br />No wonder babies may like these- they taste sweet!

review/summary: Great for this family
review/text: My 7 month old loves this flavor. He's just started really feeding himself last month and I've tried some other brands. Most were too firm to properly "melt" without chewing. I know, because I personally tried them before giving them to him. I looked over the ingredients before purchase. (Apparently, some of the other reviewers on here did not. Their problem, not yours/ours.) It says in red letters on the container for this flavor, just below the ingredient list: "Contains wheat. No dairy. No corn. No soy." It also says that of the flavors, only Strawberry and Sweet Potato are gluten free. If you're concerned about ingredients in the foods you give your child, it's probably a good idea to read the ingredients first.<br /><br />The initial taste is a touch sweet, followed by a mild toasted flavor. Kix is the same way, only many times more intense. I like that if you just put them in your mouth and provide moisture and pressure they dissolve easily. I also like that they have the choline, and are sweetened with juice not sugar. Even if my son hated these, I'd probably snack on them myself. LOL.<br /><br />There you go. Bottom line, we both like them and hope to try the other flavors as well.

review/summary: Not an item to buy in bulk for my little guy!
review/text: My son was eating a good amount of these puffs when he was first exploring finger foods.<br />We loved them because they are a perfect size for him to pick up and put in his mouth as he developed his pincer grasp.  I was able to buy them in bulk one time before this and he ate the entire 6 containers!  Woo hoo!<br /><br />Now, as he nears his 1st birthday and his food options continue to broaden, he refuses these puffs.  I'm going to continue to offer them to him, but it is disappointing that he has dismissed them considering I have 5 more containers waiting for him.<br /><br />Definitely a "teachable moment" for this first-time mom.  Most likely I'll end up giving away the uneaten containers.<br /><br />On a related note, unless your baby eats a lot of these a day, I've noticed they go stale rather quickly too.  When he was really into these puffs it would still take him a week to get through a container, and they'd be stale only a few days into opening them.

review/text: I LOVE these snacks.  Okay, not for me, for my son.  He's now 16 months and has been eating them for at least 6 months.  They are great first snacks when baby has no teeth to chew because they melt in your mouth.  They are light and airy and really easy for baby to eat.  My son recently got some his molars and wouldn't chew anything.  It's was down to yogurt and the puffs.  They worked beautifully.  At this point, he's got enough teeth that I'm upgrading him to a little bit more crunchy food, but these puffs have been great.  We've tried the banana, apple and green and he likes them all.  Only bad thing is that they go stale REALLY QUICKLY!!! Gotta keep them in the container.  If you put them in a snack cup, they will be stale in less than 12 hours. They turn chewy and not so good.

He has great fun trying to pick them up and the look of satisfaction he gets when he actually gets them in his mouth is priceless!<br /><br />I've tried them too, and they're not too sweet and they nicely dissolve in the mouth.<br /><br />My only issue is that I had a canister and the puffs inside turned kind of stale and stuck together.  I read the back of the package and it says "for best results eat within a week". There's no way my baby could eat all that in a week, so I ended up either transferring them to a more airtight container or putting them in a ziploc bag.

review/summary: Can't live without these!
review/text: We started using this product around 7-8 months which is when our daughter was starting to get the hang of chewing food. These have been the PERFECT trainer! Dissolves quickly, but lets her get a good couple of chews in before melting. Most importantly, she loves them! We have the 'green ones' and have also tried the apple. We don't leave the house without these; it's a great low-cal snack for her while we finish our meal in an actual sit-down restaurant :)

review/summary: Awesome early finger food for fussy teether
review/text: My little guy has been teething nonstop since forever. If the teeth aren't coming in, they're about to. He often seems discomforted by the irritation and pain.<br /><br />That said, crunchiness has often provided some soothing for him.<br /><br />While these aren't terribly crunchy after about half a second, he always seemed happy jamming them into his mouth and biting down.<br /><br />Once regular solid foods were introduced he pretty much gave up on these. I'd say the were good from 7-10mos for him.<br /><br />We went through about a dozen containers during that time.<br /><br />The containers, btw, make great bowling pins and robot arms afterward!

review/text: My son loves these puffs... they do have a bland vegetable infused asian rice cracker flavor... not too sweet at all :)  the taste is close to baby mum-mums... definitely the least sugary baby rice puffs we have have tried. Oh and the ones i received said that the puffs contain choline-- which is a supplement like DHA that promotes brain development -- which wasn't shown here on Amazon so that was a good surprise. I will be buying this again. Shipment was super fast! thank you amazon mom prime!

review/summary: Meets baby's approval, hence it met ours
review/text: Simply put, my daughter has decided to stuff as many as possible into her mouth at once, which signifies how much she enjoys the product.  We also now need to teach her patience, slight portion control techniques ("One at a time, sweetie!" works fine, thankfully!), and taking one's time to enjoy their food.  :)  Here are our thoughts:<br />1) Lightly sweetened, when compared to other brands and flavors.  In fact, I'm pretty sensitive to over-sweetened foods, and I likened these to regular Cheerios with a hint of sugar and other flavors.<br />2) I'm able to interpret the toughest of often-unpronouncable ingredients found in many "food" products these days, but that's just me since it has a tie to my current occupation.  So, I was surprised at how simple and straightforward the ingredient list is; I'd encourage purchase of this organic product based upon that alone (assuming that the company is truthful in its advertising).  Although our child appears to eat whatever is placed in front of her (this is her daddy's sense of adventure already poking through), I'm not worried about her getting enough greens into her developing body; however, if your child is fussy about veggies, this could be a nice substitute until you find a more creative way to blend in greens into the child's diet (current articles appear to lean more towards "trickery," "disguising," and "entertaining" the child when it comes to getting them to eat foods which we ordinarily would have had forced down our throats -so to speak- when we were little!).  This product may partially solve that issue.<br />3) Like competitor brands, this product does "melt" into a newly teething baby's mouth within an appropriate amount of time whether it's chewed or sucked upon by the baby, rendering it less of a choking hazard if you're concerned about that as we once were.<br />4) The container itself contains more product per container than do its competitors, which is quite nice.  Depending upon where you purchase a competitor brand, this one may be slightly higher per ounce, but it's worth it.  We don't forsee a need to purchase another case until 1-2 months pass.<br />5) The containers themselves are rather durable.  Unless your child is body-slamming it to the ground or you're stepping on it with all your weight, don't count on it shattering easily at all.  Plus, it's conveniently recyclable, and the opening is not too flimsy and snaps closed well enough.

review/text: I purchased these because they are organic, have less sugar, and are fortified. My daughter started eating these at about 7 months; they are great as finger food and dissolve in the mouth, so she never had any problems. She is a year old now and still loves them. I have been known to sneak a few myself.

review/text: My baby is in love with these puffs. When we bring out the container, he gets so excited! They melt nicely in his mouth, which is good because he sometimes likes to stuff his mouth with a few at a time. Not only are they (to my knowledge the only) organic puffs, but they also have a fraction of the sugar compared to other brands.<br /><br />My baby loves the green, banana, and apple flavors. I've tasted them too (I couldn't resist), and they're not too shabby. After all, I would never feed anything to my baby that I couldn't stand to eat myself.<br /><br />As far as the quantity goes, I was at first wary of buying a 6-pack. However, my baby loves these so much, that we'll definitely use them before he outgrows them or they expire.

review/summary: Satisfied.
review/text: I read a review that said some will have almost no flavor and some will have a lot. This hit the nail on the head. Grab a handful and eat them one at a time. Some are bland like a Cheerio and some are almost sour, like jarred banana baby food is. That being said, flavor is not much of an issue. I don't see parents lining up to eat their kid's pureed peas. It's about what is better. I really don't like ANY food going into my baby's system that has a paragraph long list of ingredients that sound more like a science experiment with a recipe, but I feel better about these puffs than the Gerber ones. Also, I bought this at Target instead of from Amazon.

It is sweetened with apple juice.<br /><br />My 9-month-old baby has been eating these for a few months now, she loves them!  In fact, I have to keep myself from eating them by the handful.

review/text: I care for a baby who absolutely loves these puffs. Perfect for his little hands and growing desire to feed himself. In fact, he loved them so much that I decided to try them myself. They're a satisfying snack, and only 25 calories a serving, so they win in my book for a grown up light snack as well. My only complaint is that they do not seem to have much kale or spinach in them at all. I definitely consider them as more of grain with little to no veggie content.

review/text: I didn't want to buy them in bulk before trying them out. I've been sorry before.<br /><br />I found these newly stocked at my local SW and gave a few to my 8 mo. He totally went for them. He's no where close to being considered picky, and he loves to feed himself.<br /><br />I tried some and they really are bland. They only had sweet potato, so that's what I am reviewing the taste of, but they are for babies. Babies are ok with bland. I wouldn't mind snacking on these. They don't make a mess like his Earth's Best teething crackers so that's a plus with me for sure. And even Cheerios make a wee bit of a messs. These are mess free, unless he gets greedy and shoves a ton in his mouth and spits them out again...a slobbery mess of soggy rice. That's only happened once and that was his older bros fault.<br /><br />I'll stick with Cheerios for at home and have these on hand for in the car to keep him occupied on long trips. Good compromise.

review/summary: Good product, packaging could be better
review/text: We have tried both the apple and greens flavors and my 12 month old son loves both-- has been eating them since 8.5 months. They dissolve quickly, so no real fear of choking or serious gagging (my little guy has a stronger gag reflex than most kids his age). The product itself is okay tasting-- sort of akin to a rice cake with a little sweetness? My son seems to think they're terrific and pursues them with almost the same vigor as he does his yogurt melts (also by Happy Baby).<br /><br />My only real complaint is the package itself-- the top pops open really easily. I had one open in my checked luggage on a trip once (oh that was fun), then another time when I had a container in the diaper bag for the day (two separate containers, so it was not just one faulty package). By that time I learned my lesson. I actually put the puffs into a Tupperware container after I initially open, because the package does not make a very tight seal (as evidenced by repeated opening) and they seem to go stale quickly.

review/summary: Great in theory, not so good in taste
review/text: I bought these because I was looking for an alternative to Gerber puffs for several reasons, including the sugar content and their corporate parent. These had good reviews so I decided to give them a try.  Good:  organic, not made by large corporate company, low sugar and all natural. My complaints are the following: 1) they taste stale right out of the package.  My baby probably doesn't know the difference, but to me the texture is soggy and chewy. 2) They don't taste like anything. Yes, I know I wanted less sugar but I assumed they'd taste like something! I bought the apple variety, so perhaps another flavor would be more interesting but these seriously taste like nothing.  3) the top doesn't stay closed very well.  AS I mentioned earlier, they come out tasting stale from the get-go, but the fact that the top doesn't stay shut very well makes them ridiculously stale within days. Unfortunately I cannot recommend these.

review/text: We'd been getting Greens Puffs for a while now for our 12 month old, and he used to love them - in fact, he couldn't get enough of them. However, based on our most recent shipment, the puffs are now smaller and mostly have a much thicker green powder coating than they used to. I gave my son the new puffs, hoping he'd like them just as much, but alas, now he really doesn't like them. He'll take a bite of a few, and then he just starts throwing them on the ground. I tasted one to see what the difference was, and honestly, I don't blame him for not liking them.  They have a sort of citrus flavor, and do have a really odd smell, almost like seaweed or seaweed flavored foods. I used to have a subscription for these, but I've cancelled it and now I have a box of six containers of these puffs that I don't know what to do with. Happy Baby shouldn't have messed with a successful formula. I used to like that he was getting something a little different, but we're just going to stick with Cheerios from now on.

I like to put them in snack cups for him to eat in the car. On a somewhat unrelated note, we also reuse the plastic containers to store other dry foods (like raisins or cereal) in the pantry.
