review/summary: money wasted
review/text: I wish I knew the expiration date on this product before I bought it.  I don't drink this everyday so I will never finish the first can before the product expires.  Therefore I will have wasted my money since I will be throwing away one entire can plus the leftover from the first can.  It's such a shame.  I thought the price was a great deal but now I realize the seller probably wanted to get rid of them asap because of them expiring soon.

review/text: The Vanilla Chai is my favorite, makes a great iced chai on a hot summer day. I can't get it at the local coffee shops that used to carry it, so I was glad to find it here. I tend to want my chai drinks a little less sweet and strong, so making it myself lets me have it my way, and with this large can I can make whatever size I want at the time.

review/summary: Pricey Hot Chocolate.
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker, hell, I even own a often visited tea reviewing blog. I am obsessed with chai tea.<br /><br />That all being said, I was disappointed in the flavor of this chai tea. It honestly tastes like a hot chocolate with a tiny bit of spice added. I can taste a hint of clove, ginger and some cinnamon. The sugar in this mix is ridiculous. I tried to make it with half the directed amount and am left with little flavor, I tried to make it with double the amount and I am accosted with sweetness.<br /><br />Maybe next time I will try the spicy chai by Big Train. If that's a bust, I will never try this brand again.

review/summary: My favorite chai!
review/text: Many years ago I tried my first Chai at Border's book store, they had their own brand and they even sold a tin of the powder, I loved it.  Then they quit making it.  I tried chai at all different kinds of coffee shops and cafes and did not like it.  I don't drink coffee or tea but I love a good, creamy chai.  I came across this chai and decided to try it.  It tastes almost exactly like the chai I used to love.  Now this is my favorite kind and I have it on autoship so I never run out.  I usually drink one mug a day.  I put almost 2 scoops, add a little almond milk...just enough to cover the powder, stir it up then add hot water.  It's my comfort drink.  I'm trying to wean off it because of all the sugar but it's so yummy it's hard to give up!  Maybe in the summer when it's hot I won't want it everyday.

review/text: The title for this review says it all - "Very Delicious." I first encountered this brand at a local coffee shop in my neighborhood. I like it so much I went ahead and purchased two canisters and a frother just to be able to have a Chai Tea Latte whenever I desired.<br /><br />I discovered it's a challenge to find vanilla chai. Most chai teas out there seem to be "spicy." But this brand is really smooth and is a very nice blend of many flavors, in addition to the vanilla. It's not overwhelmed by the vanilla flavor though and does not taste artificial.

review/text: I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday. My girlfriend is VERY picky when it comes to food and drink choices and she couldn't be happier with Big Train Chai! She was first introduced to Big Train at a local coffee shop so I decided to buy her this to save cost and time. She actually makes her chai with cold milk and loves how easy it travels and stays fresh throughout the day. Her only complaint would be that the chai powder sometimes clumps because there is not hot liquid but it doesn't affect the taste. I would definitely recommend this product for any chai or coffee lover!

review/text: There's a Chai place I usually go to,  but that can get expensive so I started looking around for powders I could use at home.  I tried two other powders before this,  one from WalMart and one from Trader Joes,  can't remember the names,  but this one beats both.  It has a pleasant soft chai taste without being overly spiced or spicy.

review/summary: Tastes great, but full of caffeine and sugar
review/text: First, let me say that I LOVE the taste of this chai.  It is my favorite chai and until I bought these two huge cans, it was something I enjoyed every couple of weeks when I was out shopping.  Knowing how expensive it is to order from a coffee shop, I thought it would be better to just make it myself.<br /><br />Making it at home, I use milk instead of water and only use about half of the recommended scoop.<br /><br />Once I got the cans, I looked at the list of ingredients.  Sugar is number one on the list and each serving has 24 grams of sugar in it.  (That's almost 70% of each scoop.)<br /><br />As others have mentioned, it definitely has caffeine in it.  One 8 ounce cup of this prepared chai has about as much caffeine as two 12 ounce cans of Coke.  After a short while, I noticed that the caffeine was starting to affect me- by way of headaches.  I don't really understand the company's claim of being 99.8% caffeine free when clearly it is not.<br /><br />While I think the flavor is great, I won't buy this again due to the caffeine and sugar content.

review/text: Like many others, I've been so addicted to Dunkin Donuts' Vanilla Chai. DD's Vanilla Chai is so incredibly delicious, it's almost too good to be true. I realized I have been spending a lot of money at DD for their Vanilla chai, and started to search online to see if there's anything that's as good. I found this, Big Train Vanilla Chai. It is good. It's very good. It doesn't taste exactly DD's, but it's pretty close. I make it with half water and half milk, it's amazing on a cold morning. I'd recommend it to everyone that also likes DD's Vanilla Chai. Although, I still miss DD's Vanilla Chai, for it's rich froth and creamier taste.

review/summary: Big Train Vanilla Chai
review/text: This is a wonderful powdered chai mix.  It is mixed with hot water, can be iced, can have milk added.  A local shop here served it and sold it for home use.  I really like it.<br /><br />That said, I subtracted a star because of the "99% caffeine free" statement in the product listing.  While it may be technically correct (I'm not sure how I'd calculate whether the can contains only 1% caffeine, and whether by weight or volume), I think it is misleading.  I use caffeinated products, but seek decaf for my son.  I do not feel that 65mg of caffeine per serving counts as "caffeine free," and would suggest that this part of the product description should be amended or removed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I see that at least one other reviewer has noted the caffeine issue, and I will call attention to it, as well.  Still great tasting chai mix, would just like to see an improved product description rather than a misleading statement and a legal disclaimer.

review/summary: Best Chai in the East
review/text: I used to buy Big Train Vanilla Chai all the time from a local coffee shop when I lived in the mountains of North Carolina. However, after I moved I could not find anything that compared to it. All the usual chain coffee shops just couldn't match their quality. So I decided to start buying my own. If I am using a cup that holds 12 oz of liquid, I usually heat 6 oz of water, 6 oz of milk, and add 2 scoops of chai for an excellent combination.

review/summary: Just What I Wanted
review/text: I had this chai tea at a local restaurant and loved it.  After searching all over for it I finally found it here at Amazon and was quite pleased. Though I think it is a little expensive, I haven't found any quite as rich and satisfying.  One caution is that it's fairly sweet and higher in calories and saturated fat than I wish it was, but the taste makes up for it.

review/text: For some reason here in NJ i cannot find anywhere that sells vanilla chai, except for Dunkin Donuts! In CA you can find this stuff in nearly any supermarket. Great price, @ around $10 a can, and they are huge cans. Very happy with purchase will be buying more when this lot runs out.

review/summary: Love Chi Tea
review/text: When in N.Y. visiting my sister she introduced me to amazon vanilla chi tea. We would have a cup every night before bed. It would be a relaxing time enjoying a good cup of tea and conversation. It is delivered to her door every couple months. Now I am back in Ks and have ordered it to be delivered on a regular schedule. Miss my sister and the conversation though.

review/summary: Great taste, gerat value...better than Starbuck's.
review/text: Big Train Vanilla Chai is absoulutly amazing. I never hesitate when it comes to buying this for my wife and I. As my description says, it is better than Starbuck's Vanilla chai by a long shot. I am planning to get a coffee/expresso machine that also has a steamer built on becuase that is how our local coffee shop makes this with milk, and that is how it taste's the best. This is a great value as well! this last us for a very long time, and the money is well worth it, considering it cost you $3-$5 for a single cup of this at your local shop. it taste great, and for the coffee shop fell, just add some ready whip or Zip Whip to the top and your good to go. Great Taste, Great value!

review/summary: Amazingly Addictive!!!
review/text: My cousin has been drinking the "Spiced Chai Tea" for months now and it's pretty tastey, but I wanted to try the Vanilla because I prefer a smoother tasting tea. And let me just say... I am sooo happy that I decided to purchase the "Vanilla Chai Tea." It's delicious with warm water, but if you want a creamier taste try it with milk. When I was developing a slight cold I mixed one scoop of the tea, 7oz. of hot water, 1 tsp of honey, and 1.5oz of Remy Martin 1738 Cognac and it was heaven in a coffee mug :o). I can honestly say that I am addicted to this stuff and I'm not ashamed to admit it. If your a "Calorie Counter," BEWARE of this tea - it's hard to have just one cup a day!1!

review/text: I've been buying Big Train Vanilla Chai since 2002-2003ish, and it is by far my favorite chai that I have found. The taste and texture is smooth, and flavorful... I tend to like my chai rich, so I mix it with milk instead of water. I also like to add BT to my coffee (with a touch of milk) when I'm in the mood for sweet pick-me-up :) My husband likes to mix Big Train Vanilla Chai mix in his Tazo Chai tea for a little extra spice once in a while, but he does like BT all on it's own. It's always a big hit with company too. :)

She would always send it to his house and when we received it he would call and tease me that he was enjoying my portion of the chocolates.  Unfortunately my grandmother passed away and the yearly packages stopped.  But then came along the internet and I was able to find these candies and have them shipped!  I was so excited when I received the chocolates the first year I ordered them, I could not wait until Christmas eve to surprise my brother with these, it was a big hit!  It doesn't matter what else I get him every year as long as I carry on the tradition of giving him Asbach Uralt Brandy chocolate!

review/summary: Helped with illness and recovery!
review/text: I rescued a 3 year old Doberman Lily a few months ago who was not in the best of health, and after getting a checkup at the Vet, I found out that she has heartworms.  After all the shots she just received, she had to go through a lengthy treatment with more medications than I would ever want to give my dog, but I had no choice.  I was determined to get her healthy again, and knew that good nutrition would be especially important during this time of illness and treatment.  Lily received Olewo Carrots and Red Beets with her daily meals, and while the carrots improved her digestive health, I feel it was the Olewo Red Beets which played an important role in her recovery.  The red beets are a great natural detoxifier and helped get rid of the toxins in her system from all the medications. It also helped strengthen her immune system.  At the very beginning of her treatment she was sleeping most of the time, but after adding the red beets to her diet, she had more energy and was more active.  Lily is doing well now and will continue to receive Olewo to make sure she remains in good health.

review/summary: Wonderful refreshing taste
review/text: I love this tea, it is very refreshing and the aroma is full as well.<br />i can not believe that i have to resort to ordering it online, as this type is the only one that has a nice rounded taste. The other options, makers, including the organic version taste all watered down to me.<br />Swanson delivered the tea quickly and the package had no damage - good service!

review/text: Not only am I not a fan of tea, I'm not a fan of licorice but I was open to trying this as a means to help me manage my IBS (I also use fennel and peppermint tea). This tastes so delicious, I want to drink it whether my stomach feels good or not! Yummy! And a cup does sooth my savage stomach.

review/summary: Great for iced tea!
review/text: Over the years I have tried making iced tea out of dozens of different herbal teas and most just end up tasting like lightly-flavored water.  This Yogi Sweet Thai Delight tea is the first I've tried that I will make again.  As a matter of fact, I intend to have a jug of it in the refrigerator all summer!  The taste is amazingly sweet (but not in a sugary way) and a little nutty (actually "coconut-ty.")  I don't use sweeteners or milk in my tea as a rule, but even if I did I wouldn't want to add sugar to this tea, it's perfectly sweet as it is.<br /><br />Since there's no recipe for iced tea on the box, I just winged it and put 8 tea bags into a gallon of boiling water, then turned it down and let it steep covered for about twenty minutes.  You could probably also make it the way my Mom made tea in the summer, by putting the bags in a gallon jar, adding room temperature water, sealing it and setting it in the sunniest place in the yard for the day.<br /><br />However you make it, you really should try this tea iced.  I'm not a huge tea drinker normally, but I'm completely hooked on this one.

review/summary: THE BEST CHAI GREEN I HAVE TASTED
review/text: I first had the opportunity of having this tea about 13 years ago.  The blend used for this tea is very smooth.  I have tried several other chai green tea brands, but none can compare to Yogi Tea.  I have allowed several friends, and co-workers to sample this tea, and all are hooked on it.  I have also tried the redbush chai, and black chai teas from Yogi Tea, all were very good but the taste of the chai green is superb by far.  Follow the directions, allowing the tea to steep, to get the full effect, you won't be disappointed.  I usually use white sugar only as a sweentener, but have also used Equal sweetener.  Thank you Yogi Tea for a wonderful tea.

review/summary: Deceiving
review/text: The product information doesn't tell you that the tea includes processed sweetener (stevia), butterscotch flavoring, and some other processed ingredients.<br /><br />This is not the original recipe for Yogi Tea, though it implies that it is. Even on the Yogi Tea website, it doesn't mention the added artificial ingredients (I know that stevia is from a plant, but it's hightly processed for use as a sweetener).<br /><br />I love the old original yogi tea, but I would never buy this.

review/summary: This tea is a mixture of different spices
review/text: Although this tea is flavorful and tastes fine, I should have read the description more carefully. I was looking for pure licorice root tea. This tea has other spices added to it and the orange peel flavor is dominant and licorice flavor is muted. I am giving it three stars because the name of the tea should include some of the other spices. Read the ingredients listed before you purchase. Here is the description, "Combined with a touch of cinnamon, orange peel and other carefully selected herbs and spices" If you like these other spices then you will be happy. Otherwise, you might opt for a pure licorice tea and the box will say, "Ingredients: Licorice Root". That was what I really wanted, although this tea tastes perfectly good.

review/text: Really do love the flavor of licorice, with this tea I can get that without the  sugar.  It is naturally sweet. The licorice flavor doesn't intensify with longer steeping time so if you want tht flavor to be more intense you have to use two bags.  My husband hates this tea though, he is Japanese and it reminds him of the herbal tonics they made him drink as a kid! More for me...!<br />I also like the Yogi Throat Cure tea, similar flavor but has cherry bark.

review/text: I love this tea. Spicy sweet,  If your first pick in the chocolate aisle is the one with the hottest chili nibs, this is your no-calorie alternative.<br />However, we must talk about the price on Amazon.  I'm searching the site because I first encountered the tea while on vacation in New York City.  Fairway carries it for about half the price of listed here.

review/text: My mom gave me licorice tea whenever I had a bad throat, and it really was soothing to my throat.  This works just as well!<br /><br />Now, if you really really dislike the flavor of licorice, you might want to stay away from this tea.  I don't typically like licorice (I can tolerate it), but this isn't too bad.  Sometimes I drink it just for the scent and flavor.

review/text: I love the Yogi brand of Chai tea...whether it's the Redbush or Green tea.  It has so much more flavor than other brands of Chai tea and I have tried a ton of varieties.  I like to make the tea strong and then add some soy milk to it to make it creamy.  It becomes a Chai Latte without all of the sugar you get from the Chai syrups used in coffee shops.  It's also good cold.

review/summary: lots of flavours in each sip
review/text: A colleague at work just gave me one of these tea bags.<br /><br />I like herbal teas but this one was really unique.<br />There were really nice lingering flavors on my tongue with every sip.<br />First, a tangy orangey sensation followed by a suttle sweetness married with a spicy masala kick shortly after.<br />The sweetness lingers around the back of the tongue afterwords.<br /><br />Nothing really Mexican about it, neither does it have any chilis. The spiciness comes from some common spices used in Masala tea.<br /><br />If this sounds like something you might like, I highly recommend that you try it.

review/summary: Spicey goodness
review/text: I'm addicted to Yogi Teas and have vowed to try them all.  This Indian Spice tea is delicious. I've found that many of the Yogi teas are not as strong as I want them to be, so the tea bag stays in until I've drank all the tea. Not so with this tea, this tea has a VERY strong Cinnamon taste, which I find enjoyable. In truth, I may have left the bag in too long today, as the cinnamon flavor is burning a little.<br />The directions on the box say to add milk (or milk substitute) and sweetener to the tea. They mean it. I tried to drink it plain, but couldn't, it just didn't taste right. However, I did add a popular flavored coffee creamer, and that worked beautifully.  This is a whole new drink now, doesn't feel like tea, it feels like a treat. Enjoy.
