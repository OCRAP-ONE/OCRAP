review/summary: Best low-glycemic sweetener on the market!
review/text: This is the BEST low-glycemic sweetener on the market, and I've tried many brands of it and this is the most wonderful, with very little imprint on what you drink.  It leaves coffees and herbal teas tasting like coffees and herbal teas!  I sure hope they get this back soon as I'm rapidly running out and don't want to try to hunt it down over the net from anyone else... :(

review/summary: Organic, Kosher, Tasty Assortment of Premium Teas & Teasans
review/text: *****<br />Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes:<br />5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called "teasans"):<br />* Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan<br />* Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan<br />* Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan<br />* Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan<br />* Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint<br /><br />2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine):<br />* Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea<br />* Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea<br /><br />2 Black Teas (contain caffeine):<br />* Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea<br />* Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea<br /><br />This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest."<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Teas for Creative Moods
review/text: Numi's tea sampler has a lot to offer if you enjoy mild teas. If you prefer stronger teas, then you may want to creatively mix and match for a new experience.<br /><br />Delicate Tea for Calm Mornings<br /><br />The Numi "Morning Rise," organic breakfast blend has elements of smooth perfection when blended with milk powder or cream. This tea has a mild dreamy flavor when using one teabag. You may want two if you prefer a stronger morning blend. If you are looking for an elegant tea, this blend of Fair Trade Certified Keemun, Darjeeling, Ceylon and Assam black tea is sure to impress. Morning Rise is a delicate tea that awakens you slowly to the day and seems to bring a new clarity to the mind.<br /><br />Dreamy Vanilla<br /><br />Numi teas are blended to an elegant perfection. Numi "Decaf Black Vanilla" is no exception and will please anyone who loves mild black tea with a hint of vanilla. For a richer experience, use two teabags per 8-ounce cup. This tea is perfect for drinking at night when you are relaxing, reading poetry or starting a new novel. The vanilla flavor is enhanced with a dash of cream or even an little vanilla syrup from France. I can recommend Rieme French Vanilla syrup or even a cane sugar to add a caramel twist.<br /><br />Delicate Ginger with hints of Anise<br /><br />Numi "Golden Chai" is a delicately spiced Assam black tea that I like to blend with the Numi "Chinese Breakfast" tea made with Yunnan black tea. Together they seem perfect and I like using two teabags per experience. This creates a flowery tea scented with anise and cardamom and spiced with cinnamon and ginger. If you like making chai with milk, heat some milk in a saucepan and then add one or two teabags. It is much more convenient than having to look around for all the separate ingredients and the spices and tea are perfectly blended.<br /><br />Afternoons in Africa<br /><br />Bushmen's Brew "Honeybush," "Jasmine Green Tea" and "White Nectar Osmanthus Spring" make a good combination for a honey/floral tea. Adding in a little honey enhances the experience. With this blend you can enjoy white tea with Osmanthus flowers, green tea with jasmine flowers and honeybush tea with a mild flavor. You may enjoy this as an ice tea in the summer.<br /><br />Lemon Iced Mint Tea<br /><br />Numi's "Gen Mai Cha" Toasted Rice Green, Simply Mint "Mooccan Herbal Teasan" and Rainforest Green "Mate Lemon Myrtle Green Tea" can be steeped together to create a delicious tea to pour over ice. Add honey while the tea is hot and lemon juice just before serving.<br /><br />The Lemon Iced Tea was the best experience of all the teas<br />and I can see myself buying a box of each tea so I can make<br />this tea again.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Suprisingly good.
review/text: Walden Farms salad dressings are a hit and miss.  Some of them are a bit off, and some of them are really good, so I decided to try 'Asian' and was delighted.  Wasn't sure what I was expecting, but the taste is very much like soy sauce with a slightly thicker consistency.  I love to pour it over chicken or fish and then pop it in the oven.  The only downsides have nothing to do with the quality/taste.  1, Sodium.  This is to be expected with most salad dressings.  If you eat it in moderation it shouldn't be an issue, but since it's zero calorie, some people think it's ok to pile it on.  This isn't the case.  2, Price.  The price tag might turn off the average consumer, but for me it's a trade off for the taste that I love and the zero calories/zero sugar advantages.<br /><br />If you're curious, and just want to try it out, I say go for it.  If you're a dieter and are looking for a serious way to cut calories, I say DEFINITELY try it out.

review/summary: Really Good If You Make A Few Adjustments
review/text: I won't eat most light or fat free dressings because if you read the label, what they take out, they generally replace with sugar and sugar spikes my appetite big time and yet, a 1 TBS serving of my favorite regular Hidden Valley Ranch dressing doesn't even begin to cover my salad the way I'd like. I'd need at least 3 TBS to make it how I want and that's just too much fat for one meal. It's almost the RDA for an entire day so that's not really feasible for me.<br /><br />What to do??<br /><br />I was THRILLED to find this dressing at my local supermarket. I think it tastes "okay" right out of the bottle but to my tastebuds, it does leave something to be desired. To make it into something I look forward to eating, I do the following:<br /><br />Hidden Valley Ranch has such a strong flavor so I can take 1 TBS of it, 2 TBS of Walden Farms Ranch dressing and approximately 2 TBS of water. Mix well and I have enough dressing for a good sized salad - about 1.5 to 2 cups of greens and it tastes GOOD to me. I don't feel at all deprived and I'm getting fewer calories (there are 70 calories in 1 TBS of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing) and it's plenty thick for what I want it to do and that's cover the salad. I don't want it drenched exactly but I want that ranch flavor with every bite. I eat this dressing almost exclusively now on any kind of salad - turkey taco, chef, asian greens, etc.<br /><br />Sometimes I'll add 1 TBS of flaxseed oil to the mix to get the benefit of the omega 3's however, be aware that 1 TBS of flaxseed oil has approximately 120 calories in it so if you're watching calories then take that into consideration.<br /><br />The above recipe is also not a bad dip for veggies though it is somewhat thin in consistency. I like it best on salads.

review/summary: Some and good, others are not
review/text: As a general rule, in my opinion, if you stay away from the creamy-type dressings, you should be ok. For example, I love the balsamic one and the honey dijon is pretty good, but ranch and bleu cheese are just inedible; I would rather just eat my salad plain.  I'm on a very low cal and almost zero carb diet, so these (especially the balsamic) have been a life saver.  I'm going to try the cocktail sauce next.

review/text: These salad dressings are a great alternative to other popular fat free dressings.  I hate those sprays that are on the market now because there isn't enough dressing for a serving for pete's sake.  I like Thousand Island Waldens Dressing the best -- made a salad with veggie steak strips, spinach, black olives and mushrooms and this dressing was perfect! I've tried Ranch, Balsamic, Caesar and Blue Cheese.  The bleu cheese is bland, but the rest I've tried have been tasty and very satisfying.  I'm glad that I don't have to waste a 60-80 calories on dressing for my salads.

review/summary: Terrible: Walden Farms Ranch Dressing
review/text: This review is specifically on the Ranch dressing, it may not apply to other flavors.  I have to admit that I bought this on a gluten free foods web site and completely missed the zero calorie description.  I don't know what people who eat zero calorie dressing are used to, but I was expecting a tasty gluten free Ranch dressing that is at least recognizable as Ranch(or dressing for that matter).  I can't believe there are reviewers saying this stuff has flavor.  Well, it does but the flavor is something like what you might get if you took a dirty dish rag, dipped it in latex paint and wrung it out on your salad: This is vile and nasty stuff! Don't waste your money on this one.

It is the only dressing you can use when on the HCG diet. I use this on my spinach and salads ... and also on my chicken, as a marinade! It is awesome. Sure makes the hcg diet a lot more bearable.

review/summary: Diabetic's Dream
review/text: For type 2 diabetics trying to control blood sugar by diet alone or with minimal medication the Walden Farms brand is heaven sent.  I have been using their dressings for several years.  Not all of their dressings are as good, in my opinion, as the Thousand Island but all will help control blood sugars.  What I like about the Thousand Island particularly is the creamy texture of the dressing and the taste.  You can use it on salads, burger melts or in a low carb rueben wrap. (I use the Santa Fe Tortilla 6 carb wrap)<br /><br />People who complain that Walden Farms products don't taste the same as 'normal' dressings have a valid point and it shows how much we have come to equate 'good taste' with sugar.  One way to check out your favorite dressing or catsup is to look at the ingredients and see how high sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn sugar, is on the list. It is no surprise that sugar is often up there near the top and often listed multiple times. Some dressings produced by major brands, however, have only two carbs per serving.  For many people, myself included, this is a tossup.  In some cases taste and cost may swing toward buying the major brand.  For more selections check at the Walden Farms website and don't forget to check at your local grocery or health food store to compare prices on this brand.<br /><br />Clearly, if you are looking to control your families intake of carbs, the Walden Farms brand is a good choice.  If you know of other brands with zero carbs that taste as good or better please add your comments to this review.  There is nothing I like better than hearing about something that tastes great with zero or low carbs.  Your comments may assist myself and others who are living with diabetes and want to live a better and longer life.

Now the shipping is still the same for this flavor of dressing only. But if you try to order their other flavors you'll find that they are charging $6.95 PER BOTTLE. Quite a surprise when you see hundreds of dollars show up in your shopping cart. I spoke with Amazon and they told me to get in touch directly with the vendor because the vendor sets the pricing. I spoke with someone at the vendor who told me to get in touch with Amazon. Then she finally told me to email her manager, be brief, and explain the difficulty. I did this and got no response. Caveat emptor, buyer beware.

review/text: As other reviewers have said elsewhere, these Walden Farms salad dressings, and other Walden Farms products, can be hit or miss. But everybody's taste is different, so I would say they are definitely worth a try. When they hit it's excellent, with no calories, fat, or carbs, and few if any artificial ingredients. When they miss... well, you move on.<br /><br />Pay close attention to the pricing on these items. They are all over the chart, ranging from reasonable to highway robbery. Some have shipping charges of $4.95 PER BOTTLE! It would seem to be a mistake, but they refused to acknowledge it and actually defended the charge. Others are over $8 per bottle w/free shipping; no bargain there either. Some, with shipping, are over $10 a bottle. It's not difficult to find much better deals on the web-try allstarhealth.com for starters, and there are probably even better ones out there.

review/text: I almost didn't try this because I bought the Walden Farms chocolate sauce and marshmallow sauce several years ago and they were awful.  But thanks to Amazon reviews, I decided enough people liked the salad dressings that I should give them a chance.<br /><br />I found this at my local Fred Meyer (Kroger family) for a few pennies over $5.  The FM stores in Boise have a little diet food section, and that's where I found it.  I bought the Bacon Ranch, and I must say it's pretty good.  I had a full bowl of salad with plenty of dressing (I like lots!) for just 20 calories.  Very cool!<br /><br />I wonder how this would taste on shiritaki (yam) noodles?  I think I'll try that tomorrow.

review/text: I love this dressing. I use it pretty much with everything. This year I decided to get serious about my weight (and lost 23 lbs by the way)and with some pokes from my friends I went to HCG diet (along with those friends). In my doc office I was introduced to Walden Farms products, although I've never heard of them before. Being an on and off dieter since I can remember, that would be shame on me. I am in love with their products now. Well, most of them. This Russian dressing is one of my favorites along with Chocolate dip. I use it with everything. Cucumbers, tomatoes, spinach. It goes well with everything. It tastes good, it's light and calorie free. And I might get addicted to low calorie eating after all. Dieting becomes fun when it tastes good.

review/summary: If you're serious about calories...
review/text: I've tasted the best of the "real things," and they were wonderful and dreadfully high in fat, carbs, and calories; that includes dressings, dips, and sauces.  Yes, I've added up what goes into a salad, and those oil and fat content calories soar!  If you expect a fat-free substitute for most anything to be a close equivalent, forget it; you'll have to do with eating the tiniest bits of food to lose weight.  If you expect a zero-calorie substitute to taste the same, ditto.  However, the key here is to find the best of the WF products for you.  I can't do the Peanut Spread (and I'm addicted to Peanut Butter), but most of the other products I can manage.  Some of the dressings are really good, especially the Balsamic.  Loving sweets, I keep handy an assortment of chocolate sauce and dip, caramel sauce, pancake syrup, and I've recently "discovered" the blueberry pancake syrup.  The trick is not to use too much because, yes, there is an aftertaste, but if you use the right amount, it's a darn good substitute.  AND...the calories...the carbs...the fat...don't add up!!

review/summary: Cal-free Thousand Island huge disappointment.
review/text: I was looking for no-fat salad dressings and stumbled across Walden Farms Thousand Island dressing. Wow, what a huge disappointment. Doesn't smell good, doesn't taste good, nothing. I'm serious. This product doesn't come anywhere close to the real thing and I have tried several no-fat dressing that do. Sorry, this needs to come off the shelf.

review/text: Although I detest most reduced-calorie dressings, I like the Walden Farms Ranch dressing.  I have no idea how this can have zero calories.  Keep in mind, though, that if you're used to the high-calorie dressings, you'll spit this out with disdain.  However, if you, like I, avoid such indulgences, then your palate is ready for Walden Farms Ranch.

review/summary: Strictly for Those on a Diet
review/text: I would certainly compliment Walden Farms for their line of zero-calorie salad dressings.  It's really quite amazing how they can do this.<br /><br />The Thousand Island dressing is fair.  The major flavor that comes across is vinegar.  In small amounts, mixed into a salad, it does the trick.  It gives a kick to "boring" field greens.  In larger amounts, it's no better than tolerable, but you may feel good that you can have a huge greens salad and dressing for under 50 calories.  One thing is clear:  It does not taste much like full fat or low fat Thousand Island dressing.

review/summary: Ranch Flavor Dresssing is OK...
review/text: At first try, I was tempted to give it a slightly higher rating, but I guess it depends on you sensivity to some of the "flavoring" used.  I actually had a fairly low expectation, so for me, this was a bit better than I expected.  I used it to make a tuna salad, so some of the flavors are better suited to that perhaps.  I am on a strict low carb diet so this seems to be good enough.

review/summary: Absolutely DISGUSTING! TOO SWEET!!
review/text: I have to give it 1 star because they wont allow for any less... this ranch dressing is also waaaaaayyy too sweet, the chemical taste of the Splenda overtakes the taste of the actual product itself...I could never understand why they have to add soo much artificial sweetener to something such as a salad dressing, this is one of the five Walden's Calorie Free product I have tried and been VERY disappointed with... I was already taking my chances knowing it was sweetened with Splenda instead of Stevia but for God's sake why make it soo unpalatable?!  there are soo many alternatives out there and why kill it with soo much sweeterner?  My other reviews for these products may be around the same... but darn... I best just make my own dressing, might not be 100% calorie free but at least it will be consumable.  Why does RANCH need sugar?! WTF?  I have made ranch from scratch and never once did I add any sugar to it!  Also there is a dry chemical flavor that comes with this...  I am sooo lucky my healthfood store has a nice return policy because after tasting all these dressing products I could NOT use them and felt jipped because these aren't that cheap..

Nothing I've tried of these dressings really tastes like normal salad dressing, but these make terrific alternatives if you're looking for a dressing that minimizes caloric intake.  The Vinaigrette also has made a good "dipping" dressing for bread, etc.  Just try a few and see which ones you like.

review/text: I am a serious weight control person.  I recently lost 25 lbs and I determined not to regain it.  The key is lots of salad and lots of veggies with adequate protein and eat frequently. I use Bacon Ranch and add some straight balsamic vinegar to my salads.  Delicious.  I use the vinaigrettes on vegetables and then roast or BBQ them.  If you hate these dressings, in my opinion you don't REALLY want weight loss or weight control.  Are the "regular" dressings better?  I don't know and I don't care.  I am a 66 year old female athlete and I love being trim.

review/text: I tried each salad dressings of walden farms and bleu cheese is one of the most unsavory ones that also ruins the taste of the salad. It tastes and smells like white glue. So I would suggest Coleslaw dressing which is great and can also be used for Caesar salad. French also tastes good for giving a spicy taste to the salad.

review/summary: From a HUGE fan of Walden Farms
review/text: We've been ordering these dressings directly from Walden Farms for many years and haven't yet had a flavor we didn't like.  Our favorites are the Caesar, the Bleu, and the Ranch, but we also regularly enjoy the Creamy Italian, Russian, and Thousand Island.  You can buy them directly from Walden Farms, up to 10 bottles in an order, for a flat shipping fee of $7.95. Make the salads as rich as you want with tasty ingredients -- we like avocadoes in ours, providing healthy monosaturated fat, or a dollop of virgin olive oil -- and save calories BIG TIME with these delicious dressings. Any of them will also make a wonderful dressing for cole slaw and broccoli slaw, although WF also has a very good Cole Slaw flavor.  And the kids love them as dips for fresh veggies.

review/text: I don't know how this compares to other brands ...just tried a few...some the oil stays on top and the bottom of the jar or can ends up dry.  They all taste pretty much the same the consistancy is a bit different.  This one is a bit slurpy and I could pour it if I wanted to..  The taste by itself is a base and by adding olive oil seasoned with garlic , some salt etc the flavor boosts dramatically.  A spoonful on some chopped celery with olive oil and garlic and wow. Mix this with a baked scouped out roasted eggplant and it becomes sensational.  I am going to try it on some black beans  I heard of a man who made his tuna fish salad with this.  Traditionally it is mixed in with mashed chick peas for hummus.  Eat it with crackers or pieces of red pepper and other veggies for a healthy snack.  I'm not sure brand matters at all for taste if you prefer it thick and pasty then try another but I think this brand is top of the line for quality.

I think the picture must be old, because there's no mention of walnuts on the wrapper on any of the packages I've received. The quality has varied from one case to another; the last case was excellent, but the one before that had salted peanuts in it (presumably they got in the mix by accident, since this trail mix is supposed to be unsalted). All in all, it's good trail mix for the money, and the bags are a convenient size for snacks.

review/summary: Worst Mix Ever Used!
review/text: Don't waste your money.  This is supposed to be Rosemary & Basil bread mix but it has only a miniscule hint of Rosemary flavor and forget the Basil.  Secondly, there is supposed to be a packet of yeast "in the box" but there was not a single packet of yeast in any of the four packages that comprised the order.  I called the company just to make sure that the yeast was not included in the mix itself and the "in the box" was a printing error but the Mama Leone's representative I spoke with assured me that a seperate packet of yeast should have been included in each box of bread mix.  The representative was also quick to say that four packets of yeast "...will be immediately shipped to you to make up for what you had to buy in order to make the bread".  Well.....it's been almost THREE months since shipment was promised and I have yet to see any yeast packets.  Don't think this small firm located in a comprably small town near Tulsa OK can afford to incur the displeasure of amazon.com customers since it would be my guess they may sell a number of their mixes over amazon's web site.  The missing yeast is a relatively small thing to me personally but the untruth regarding sending replacement yeast packets is not.  Poor business acumen is exhibited when a company can't be truthful in its' business dealings with customers.  Forget this one and save your money.  The mix doesn't taste as it is reported to taste and you may or may not have to buy your own yeast before you can even mix or bake the bread!

review/summary: For a developed palette
review/text: I would say Theo Chocolate produces a much higher quality product than most mass producers (i.e. Godiva/Ghirardelli) however their chocolate has a very high amount of cocoa in it as opposed to some other typical products, so the taste may be more strong/bitter/crumbly than you are accustomed to. People who usually like creamy milk chocolate would probably not like this bar for a number of reasons:<br />1) It's 70% dark chocolate, which means the cocoa butter/fat content is much lower, and therefore the texture will be not as fatty/creamy<br />2) It's extremely pure with very few additives which lends itself to a more cocoa-based flavor (if you've never eaten raw cacao nibs or you have and you hated them, again, not for you).<br /><br />I'm not trying to be a snob, but I do think that to work up to a product like this takes some time and development of one's palette and taste. Theo produces fantastic quality confections and bars and should definitely be supported especially since they are the nation's only bean-to-bar 100% organic chocolatier.

review/summary: WOW! Best cat treats EVER!
review/text: We have two cats - one who is picky about her treats and one who eats just about everything.<br />As soon as I opened this bag, they both came tearing over to see what it was.  I have never seen such purring, pawing at the bag, and frantic treat seeking before in my life!  If I didn't know better, I would swear it was a bag if straight catnip, but I don't think that even that would get this big a reaction from the cats.<br /><br />How much do they love them?  We only give them reguarly when checking our diabetic cat's blood glucose.  She has always tolerated this activity - barely - but now begins purring like crazy as soon as she sees us get out her test kit box, because she knows she'll get one of these treats.  They are apparently so yummy that they make a needle jab in the ear sound like fun!  Other cat has actually bashed the kit to the floor to open it, just to get to the treats.<br /><br />I'm guessing there is not much that a cat wouldn't do for one of these seemingly addictive, crunchy, fishy smelling little delights.<br />We're thrilled that they are so in love with something from a health-oriented company; there is no junky "filler" in these, and they are grain free.<br /><br />"Wild Cravings" treats are perhaps the most appropriately named pet product that we've ever purchased - cats seem to crave them, and will do some pretty wild things to get them!

review/summary: Love Evo, but this flavor was NOT a hit with the cats
review/text: We are fairly recent fans of the Evo line of cat treats.<br />We used to give our cats Temptations for quite a long time, but after<br />waking up and reading the back of the bag, we realized it was just junk food for cats,<br />and we were probably doing them more harm than good with those treats. (They also have<br />some kind of "kitty MSG" in them, because the cats literally would eat the whole bag if we had let them.)<br /><br />Evo has done a good job of getting rid of corn and wheat, two big allergens for cats.<br />Cats do not eat grains naturally, so the companies who use it are just packing in filler products.<br /><br />Our cats have loved the Evo treats, but I have to say that the herring/salmon was a bomb.<br />They are not nearly as big on these as the other two kinds. They kind of smell (which would not always<br />be a bad thing), but apparently it isn't a great smell to cats either!  Both of our cats will catch treats,<br />chase them down if thrown, etc etc. But this flavor sits on the floor until it apparently has aired out, or<br />the cat feel faint from lack of snackage. Then our older cat will come by and eat them, most likely just out<br />of spite to be sure the younger cat doesn't get them.<br /><br />I won't be buying this flavor again. However, if your cat is a fish-flavor fan (likes wet food in fishy<br />flavors, or other dry fish flavored treats), they might like this one.<br />I've not seen any gastric upset from any of the Evo flavors, so they are apparently digested well too.<br /><br />Evo, maybe you can make a mouse flavored treat, or a ham flavored one!<br />Both of our cats adore cooked ham, but you never see ham treats for cats.<br />Yes, I understand about the worm issues, but cooking to proper temperatures takes care of that.<br />There is also the odd virus from swine, but that has been eradicated in the USA, so the odds of<br />domestic cats getting anything from pork is slim to none.

Half the cats like one item, the other half don't.  Or they like it at first because it's new, then decide the "hate" it.  &lt;sigh>  With this, all cats ate and seemed to love it immediately.  The bag is pretty well packed with treats.  I thought I would go online and see if it was sold cheaper here or elsewhere.  So far my vets price of $3.09 beats the $7.99 sold here on Amazon or even the $4+ at another site, which was the lowest I could find when doing a price search.  So, guess I'll keep buying from vet.  :o)

review/text: First of all, these are not bully sticks, or bully-anything, which I thought were made from the private parts of a bull. Not calling them cow ears, which is what they are, is perhaps a strategy so as not to inflame animal activists. I get that, but these are cow ears and my Collie mix loves these treats - hence, the 5-star review. I don't have to eat them - she does. My Puggle is apparently on my side as he can't get past the extremely strong smell. Yes - It's that bad and I don't know why other reviewers have not made a point about it. I'm an old country girl and I'm not so sensitive as to be picky about such things, but please be warned that these treats are not merely "smelly" - they stink to high heaven. We have lots of smelly, yet nourishing, dog treats in the house, but when we serve up these cow ears, the entire house smells like cow manure for about 10 minutes and our hands have to be washed immediately. Please make sure that you store these things in a somewhat airtight container and use tongs when serving.

But for Pebbles cereals, they are the latest to enter that snack arena, and they have a not bad challenge, with Cocoa Pebbles Treats. They taste good, but honestly when I got a chance to try them, they actually were very small in the box, compared to the big bars Rice Krispies hve had in the candy store. Not only that, but also they didn't look like they were crumbled up in pieces either. Nevertheless, Pebbles Treats aren't bad for a change of pace. Still, I do absolutely wish that they could make a bigger version for snacking on. It is worth a try overall though.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Taste: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: 4C Totally Light Tea to Go's Lemon Ice Tea Mix is really an amazing product. The individual packets are so convenient! You can carry the packets around in your purse or backpack, grab a bottle of water, and fix yourself a delicious iced tea wherever you go. What I really like about this product is that it doesn't taste like instant iced tea... it tastes like fresh brewed tea! I've been drinking this tea for many years now and just love it. I keep a box of packets at work, carry a few in my purse, and always have a stock of tea at home. I hate being without it. Tastes great, convenient, and really a good value.

review/text: I totally agree with the first review, this tea is great anywhere! But I want to add, I also use it as a hot cup of tea ( a great 20 ounce cup) every night with my meals. And of course ice tea any time!!! Love it!

review/summary: Tasty...
review/text: I am totally addicted to these.  They are just a bit spicy, but in a good way!  If I don't have them in my cupboard, I literally salivate when I walk past them at the grocery store.  They are a nice tastey treat!

review/text: In the 60's my mother would sprinkle this mixture on every salad, every night. It is still available and tastes the same. A little flavor trip down memory lane!

review/summary: DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I purchased the Waggin' Train brand Duck Jerky and my dog became sick immediately. He was throwing up and also began to lose hair on his ear. Luckily I only given about 10 pieces in the week that I purchased the jerky. I immediately stopped giving him the treats since that was the only new item introduced. Lucky for me, my dog was able to recover from the issues brought on by the jerky. Don't ever buy anything that you can ingest which is made in China. Or better yet, just don't buy anything made in china.
