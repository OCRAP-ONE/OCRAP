review/summary: Beautiful healthy plant
review/text: Lovely plant, no brown spots or dead leaves :-)  The only thing that bothers me is that it is all growing to one side, and trying to move leaves over to balance the plant is not working without risking breakage...so it is hanging kinda lop sided.  If anyone has a suggestion, please tell me.

review/text: I bought this almost a month ago and my dog, a small Corgi mix, still chews on it every day. He seems to like antlers more than rawhides and I like that they are much healthier for him. I would definitely recommend antlers for anyone who has dogs that are big chewers!

review/summary: Long lasting and QUIET entertainment for our dog...
review/text: After many years of calm, geriatric dogs that were long past their chewing (and playing) days, we added a 15-month old Weimaraner rescue to our house as 2012 started. He's adapting to life outside of the rescue home, and we're adapting the double-barreled threat of a high-energy breed and what can only be described as lingering puppy brain (in the full size body of a grown dog).<br /><br />There are toys for exuberant play (such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MD57ZI">Kong Wubba</a>), and there are toys for quieter times, and to fully satisfy a dog's need to chew.<br /><br />First, the dog loves this chew. And when he engages with it, the result is an extended period of time when we does so in one place (very much unlike other toys, which generated motion and noise!).<br /><br />Second, it's odor and splinter free. We don't find pieces of it laying around, and it has no smell (at least to us two-legged critters).<br /><br />This was recommended to us by a local dog specialty store, and the research I've done indicates far fewer concerns about its safety compared with other chew options.<br /><br />Makes our dog happy and lets him turn down his motor a bit. What's not to like?

review/summary: Amazing Product
review/text: I decided to get this item for my new shelter dog.  He went through dog toys like mad and most dog chews would be swallowed whole, only to be puked up later on.  I was trying to find a product that he would get excited about chewing on and wouldn't be destroyed within minutes.  Boy did this fit the bill!  He has had it for well over a month now and has not even made his way through 25% of it yet.  It doesn't have a smell and it hasn't broke off into pieces.  I recommend this product to all my friends who have dogs and will be buying another one when the time comes!

review/summary: Perfect for Agressive Chewers!
review/text: I bought this antler chew bone for my daughters dog who chews up just about any chew bone almost instantly! The dog is a Corgi German Shepherd mix.  My daughter says these antler bones are the only type that just last and last, and her dog gets a lot of chewing satisfaction.  These are natural antler bones which are "harvested" from the forest after being shed by a moose. Recommend highly, especially if your dog can chew most bones up in minutes.  These antler bones last for weeks!

review/summary: A bit pricy but great for extra large dogs
review/text: This thing must have weighted 10 pounds or so.  It was huge and my mastiff has been working on it since it arrived.  He really likes it and I like that fact that there is no yucky smell like some dog treats have (bully sticks, etc....)  THis is the first Moose antler he's had.  The elk antler seemed to be less dense in the middle and didn't last quite as long as the deer antler before it did.  We've yet to see how the moose antler will stand up to time.  For the cost, I hope it lasts at least 1 1/2 months.  :-)

review/text: Have a crazy hyper dog?  Want to get some time alone?  Give them this moose antler.  A few hours later you will have to wrestle it out of their frothing mouths and hide it.  Lasts a really really really long time (several weeks of daily chew).  Our 75lb beast of an Australian Shepard lies around panting for an hour after we take it away.  Her jaws have to be sore.

review/summary: My Puggle Pup Loves It!
review/text: My puggle pup is only 6 months old and he loves this antler chew. He's on his second one. The first one I think I bought like two months ago. It was a medium antler. The one he got today is 7-10 in. He stays on these antlers for a long time. Really keeps him busy. And It does not splinter as, from what I've read, other antlers do. I know it's up there in terms of price, but if you love your pup and don't want to give him garbage, then by this antler. I will update this post in the not-too-distant future with info as to how long it lasted.

review/summary: Too small
review/text: I've been buying antlers from Chasing Our Tails for a while now and never had a problem with the size -- that is, until now. I purchased a 5-7 inch antler and the one I received was like 4 inches. And darker than the other ones. My puggle chewed it down in two days. I'm disappointed of the size and quality of the one I just received. I'm going to buy another one -- 7-10 inch -- and if the quality is the same and small I will not buy from Chasing Our Tails Again. They're expensive.

review/text: I ordered this X-Large 11 - 14 inch antler for my great dane that loves to chew.  When I received it I immediately noticed it looked really thick, but smaller than I expected.  I measured it and it was less than 10 inches in length.  He appears to love it and is chewing on it constantly.  I certainly recommend it but I'm not sure if they sent me the wrong size, they are really out of the X-Large so they made due or if the length of these vary outside of the advertised length.  Considering the price of these, I was expecting an 11 - 14 inch antler that would last a good 1 to months. Time will tell!

review/summary: I have 6 favorites, this is one of them
review/text: This review is going to get posted in 6 places, as I'm indicating my preferences for 6 different coffees. If you like one, maybe you will like the other.<br /><br />Regarding coffee, I like strong and smooth.  I don't like French roast as I find it too harsh, but I do like Italian roast.  Kona is great and I like Hazelnut, Vanilla and Chocolate flavors.<br />I drink my coffee with probably too much (at least 2-3 creamer containers worth to a 12 oz cup coffee) of evaporated milk in it or plain non-dairy creamer. No sugar.<br /><br />That being said...my favorite coffees are:<br /><br />Green Mountain Hazelnut Dark Roast Extra Bold<br />Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee<br />Newman's Own Extra Bold<br />Tully's Coffee Kona Blend Extra Bold<br />Folger's Gourmet Vanilla Biscotti<br /><br />and a special mention for<br />Timothy's World Coffee German Chocolate Cake - It has an almost coco-nutty taste to it. Not the deep chocolate taste I was looking for, but the best I have found so far. Please if you can suggest a Dark Chocolate Flavor coffee to me; do so.<br /><br />Also since I have posted a review about a Senseo coffee and now clearly have switched to Keurig a bit about why... if you're interested..which why I put it last.  Feel free to ignore it.<br /><br />We decided to get a Keurig coffee maker after enjoying the Senseo system for over 3 years.<br />Please note, since we got the Senseo system essentially free, not much thought was put into it's purchase. However it did introduce us to single serving coffee systems.<br /><br />We switched to the Keurig system from the Senseo for several reasons.<br /><br />1. Local availability of coffee. For some reason the Senseo system was waning here at the Rochester NY grocery stores and what good is a coffee maker without coffee?  Yes, you can buy online, but sometimes when your planning isn't the best, you might run out. What coffee they did carry was limited and not our preferences.<br /><br />2. Online purchases of Senseo coffees  were either for 4 bags of 16-18 of one variety or 4 bags of a mix of coffees. Invariably there was a few you didn't like.  I never saw small quantities of 5 or so.<br /><br />3. The Senseo "duck" for filling  with your own coffee never worked for us.  I'm an engineer and my boyfriend is an inspector. We literally did controlled experiments to get this to work and never could. Maybe we had a faulty unit, but based on reviews here, we were in good company. I knew many that had luck with the Keurig system however and we did as well.<br /><br />4. Once you open a bag of Senseo pods, they are starting to go stale, by virtue of being open to air. The Keurig system's coffees remain sealed and you can have many flavors "open" at once. Yes for those of you that are "green" there is more plastic waste. However I'm being selfish here and am being more concerned with the green in my pocket and fresh coffee.

review/text: I like this coffee better than most other K-Cup Coffees mainly because I can brew the coffee on the largest cup size and it is not weak.  My pet peave with these Keurig Cups is that you pay so much for them and each one only brews one cup of coffee and most of them have to be on the smaller setting to avoid being watered down.  I would prefer an even stronger coffee but this one does the job nicely on the larger setting and I don't feel like I'm being ripped off.

review/text: We got ourselves a family Christmas present--a Keurig mini-coffee maker. With it, we purchased this product. "Newman's Own" is a brand that cuts across many products--from spaghetti sauce to salad dressing and so on. And, here, coffee.<br /><br />The coffee is labeled "extra bold," and--indeed--it does have a nice rich flavor. The brewing process is such that this coffee tastes better than what I recall from our old Mr. Coffee machine. We are experimenting with other coffee brands as well, but this represents a good starting point for enjoying our Keurig coffee maker and we wouldn't hesitate purchasing more of Newman's Own in the future.<br /><br />Worth considering for the coffee lover. . . .

review/summary: Typical Chicken Noodle
review/text: This product has that faint weird taste some chicken noodle sops have.  It isn't too overpowering though. The noodles are soft, the chicken, even though not much, doesn't taste too far off from the real thing and the vegetables are an ok texture.  However, the taste isn't great or bad. It's nothing to crave and nothing you would taste and throw right out. You may want to add some seasoning and jazz it up a bit.

I almost fell over when I found Atkinsons Peanut Butter Bars SUGAR FREE and available in small and large quantities too!  I had the option to spend $18.48 for a 2lb bag.  I really don't need to spend over $100 for a 25lb bag of candy.<br /><br />The only thing I would want to know before I purchased and still want to know because it didn't come with the packaging is the ingredients and the Nutritional Facts (size of serving, calories in serving, fat, etc.)<br /><br />Thanks so much!!!

review/summary: Golden Chai Must Be Experienced!
review/text: *****<br />Numi Tea's Golden Chai Spiced Assam Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic Assam black tea, organic cinnamon, organic Chinese ginger, organic green cardamom, and organic Turkish anise. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Throughout India, chai stalls are a meeting place for provocative tea and conversation. From its homeland in China, chai has journeyed as chai, th&eacute;, and tea, recreating itself in every land. Numi's golden brewed, organic Chai fuses rich cultures in a complex and hearty Assam black tea. Indian cinnamon and mild green cardamom evoke a warm balance with the vitality of Chinese ginger. The peaked, sweet aroma of Turkish anise exhilarates memories. Reminisce in aged tradition with an inspiring cup of Golden Chai."<br /><br />Although this is a "chai", note that it contains no sweeteners...I prefer this, and the anise gives a certain type of mild sweetness, but commercial chais often have sugar added, so be prepared for a wonderful no-calorie indulgence that is beautifully flavored but not "sweet" in the same way that sugar is. Golden Chai is also caffeinated; if you want a caffeine-free chai, try Numi Tea's Ruby Chai Spiced Rooibos Herbal Teasan instead.<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love chai, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I bought this product yesterday, safety seal was intact and expiration date is dec 2011. With three different batches made three different ways, including the directions on the bottle itself, the texture of the popcorn came out the same: chewy and sticks to your teeth as if it is stale. The look of the popcorn was nice, they did come out big and fluffy, but unfortunately everyone was unhappy with the texture. In our opinion, it was not edible.

review/summary: Best pop it yourself popping corn EVER!
review/text: I love popcorn.  I've tried a lot of different "gourmet" popping corns, and even have gone generic (Wal-mart's Great Value) and this is by far the best.  It totally beats Orville.  Tried Orville once, and that was it, even tho it's cheaper than Pop Secret; you get what you pay for, sort of.  The "gourmet" types are more expensive per oz, but don't pop nearly as fluffy or as crisp and crunchy as Pop Secret.  I use the Whirley Popper, and abt 3 handfuls of Pop Secret overflows the popper.  No other popping corn I have tried pops that big.  Love this stuff!

Most of the kernels burst into the mushroom style, rather than the irregular sharp edged popped kernels.  This is my favorite.  I get many compliments on the carmel corn and inquiries on the kind of pop corn used.

review/text: So...I have tried 5 other popping corn. This bar none pops all but 3-4 when I add a whole cup.<br /><br />I use the WestBend popper<br />[...]<br /><br />The trick is this<br /><br />1. Plug in popper, let it get hot for 1 minute.<br />2. Add vege or peanut oil, 1 tablespoon<br />3. Let that turn for a minute and get hot too.<br />4. Now, heres the option, add 1/8 stick of butter, its really not that much, let the rotating arm spin it around for 30-45 sec.<br />5. NOW ADD THE POPCORN KERNELS<br />6. You'll see the kernels mesh and swim around as the arm goes around.<br />7. In 2-3 mins, you'll see 'em pop, wait till the pops have slowly ended, by then your bowl should be full.<br />8. Flip the whole popper upside down....and VOILA, the popcorn is amazing.<br /><br />If you follow this, you will never buy another kernel manufacturer or bag popcorn again<br />TRUST ME!!<br />Im salavating at work just thinking about it.<br />ENJOY PEOPLE

review/summary: Dissatisfied
review/text: I purchased this 'Premium Popcorn' about one month ago when the store in which I was shopping didn't carry Orville Redenbacher products. The 'Best By' date on the bottle was 22-Sept-2011 yet every attempt to pop this corn produced the same unpleasant result--difficult to chew with a tendency to cling to one's teeth. The bottle cap was tight at all times during storage in a dry kitchen cabinet at room temperature (nominally 68 degrees F) and the freshness/safety seal was intact when the cap was first removed. The corn was popped in a heavy bottom pot with the recommended amount of popping oil. After the first attempt to pop this corn did not turn out well, I decided to try slightly higher and slightly lower temperatures ranging above and below the recommended medium high setting.  I also tried an air popper without oil.  In each case the result was about the same.  Was the corn stale?  Had it been on the grocer's shelf too long?.  The answer to both these questions should be 'No' according to the Best By date.  Our local squirrels will enjoy the remainder of this product while I go shopping for my preferred Orville Redenbacher popcorn.

review/text: This is really great popcorn IF you pop it right.  I tried to pop it in a typical stove pan like I do other popcorn and I had no luck.  Then I used my presto microwave popper.  WOW  nervana.  Big fluffy kernels and almost every kernel popped.  What a difference.  I was shocked.  Microwave is definately the way to pop this stuff.  Just search for presto microwave popcorn popper and get some extra concentrators (little cardboard things that concentrate the microwaves onto the popcorn).  You can use each one at least 3 times, either with or without oil.  I used about 1 teaspoon of peanut oil and sirred it so every kernel was coated with a thin coat.  Its night and day difference than trying to pop this stuff in a convential stove top pan.  Enjoy.

I'm not sure about the "Jumbo" aspect of this, but either way it's great. The kernels honestly look the same size as the other brands in the store, but the taste was much better. I use the Prestor PowerPop Microwave popper by the way, throw a little olive oil in with the kernels and end up with delicious popcorn! I wish there was an organic variety from Pop Secret!

I popped it in a Whirly-Pop, which is my new favorite way to pop popcorn.  But the results were disappointing.  Out in the trash it goes!  I found Crown Jewel Popcorn on the web.  They have 14 varieties and the corn is tender and has minimal hulls!!!  And best of all, they all taste fantastic!  I still have yet to put anything but salt on it!  Skip this stuff and buy the good stuff!!!  It's worth it.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised to find that each of the 12.9 oz. box have 6 individual serving packs in it. I give 4 stars because the instruction is for microwave oven only. But it doesn't take much to figure out how to do it on the stove top. The recipe call for 2/3 cup of water, mine was very dry and have to add more. I now make it with a cup of water. It take only 3 minutes.<br /><br />The taste and texture is like what you make on the stove top, very good. One pack is enough for lunch, or late night snack. When cooked, it is about 8 oz. portion. The individual serving pack is very convenience to take with you anywhere if you have a microwave oven near by.<br /><br />The expiration date on mine is Nov. 2007. Not very far, but I think they will be all gone by then.

review/summary: Delicious and easy!
review/text: While we are generally a fairly health-conscious family, the Easy Mac has become a staple at our house. We often will mix it with tuna or organic chilly to create quick, easy, and delicious lunches. The single serving is EXCELLENT for those of us who are into portion control. The serving is also perfect for children- it gives them just enough but not too much. For our area, the price here at Amazon is MUCH cheaper than buying it at the store.

review/summary: I love me some cheesy goodness
review/text: I'm one of those people who go and go and go, and suddenly, I'm starving and have to eat *NOW* or I'll become Godzilla, roaring and stomping through the house while my poor husband runs for cover.  Plus, I'm terrible at meal planning.  I have a hard time thinking about food until it's too late.  I'll be hungry at dinner time and won't have the patience needed to make a decent meal.<br /><br />Easy Mac hits the spot!  I never buy the full sized boxes of Mac & Cheese because I don't have a crew of kids to feed.... it's just me (hubby's not a mac & cheese fan, he eats salads), and I don't like leftover mac & cheese.  Well, I used to as a kid, squirting it with ketchup, that was tasty.  Anyway, I don't like waiting for water to boil for a box of mac & cheese, and I have to get a pan dirty, too.  With Easy Mac, just pour the packets of noodles into a microwavable bowl with 2/3 cup water, and pop it in the micro for 3.5 minutes.<br /><br />I always make 1 packet at a time, never two.  The directions for making 2 packets say to add 1 cup water, but a single packet requires 2/3 cup water.... you'd think they'd recommend double the water for double the packets, right?  1 cup water is terribly dry, the cheesy powder is difficult to mix in.  Go for 1 1/3 cups water, I say.  Still, Easy Mac tastes best to me when making it 1 packet at a time, maybe because 2 packets is just too much.<br /><br />Easy Mac might not be the best nutrition for me.... anyone who knows me can tell you that my dog eats better than I do, with fresh veggies, etc.  But for me, the goal is food in my belly without resorting to eating a bag of Cheetos or a can of frosting for dinner.  Whatever the Easy Mac lacks in nutrition, that's what my daily women's vitamin is for, right?  :)

review/summary: great, easy lunch for picky kids
review/text: This is my daughter's favorite lunch! The only catch, is that you have to ignore the directions, it doesn't come out the same the way they say to do it.  They say to just mix the cheese in when cooked, but for it to taste good, you have to drain the water, then add a little butter and milk (very little) along with the cheese. The other thing is that each of the 6 pouches inside is very small-my 6 year old eats two at a time!  It's so easy and quick to make though, especially in the morning before school to put in her thermos-she has it once or twice a week!

You can really taste the difference - they don't feel as processed as most other jarred sauces.<br /><br />I gave what was left in the bottles to guests to take home as party favors.  Just yesterday, I dropped in to say hi to one of them, and they were snacking on one of the sauces with some slices of french bread.  I am definitely going to start giving these as gifts to my foodie friends.

review/text: Next time you are at the grocery store, just check the instructions on the box and you'll see that it's different than the original. The wacky shapes usually use the Spirals recipe too. Notice that regular mac&cheese says 'original recipe' under it. That stuff is junk compared to the Spirals. The people that don't notice the difference don't eat much mac & cheese.<br /><br />If you're deciding which flavor to get, get the spirals. The people who say it doesn't make as much must be talking about volume, because the boxes are all the same by weight, 5.5oz. The spirals just tend to pack more together after they are cooked because they don't have the hollow center. It's the same amount, but it takes up less room on your plate and is way more delicious.

review/summary: Kraft to the rescue!!
review/text: I'll admit this it sad compared to real mac and cheese. The cheese only remotely tastes like cheese, it's not gooey and and thick and delicious with the burnt crusty top. But who has the time to go out and buy all the ingredients, prepare it and wait for it to cook? And then you have a giant dish of calorie laden, atery clogging cheesy goodness staring you in the face. So this is the perfect solution. It takes about 10 minites to make, and it's good enough to be worth the calories. For about 550 calories with a little I cant believe it's not butter you have a generous bowl. Its' cheap too so I can stock up and always have some on hand. It's a staple in our apartment where we're both lazy and dont like to cook. It doesnt taste amazing but considering everything it's a solid 5 stars.

review/summary: Fills Young Bellies While Mending Broken Hearts
review/text: Kraft Macaroni and Cheese beckons back to lonely days running home at lunchtime. As I lay heart-strewn and crying about the harsh rejection meted upon me by the fairest of the playground beauties, soft noodles in a cheese cream sauce would ease my ache.<br /><br />Daily, at morning recess, I would smile weakly and say hello to Heidi, who, in return would grimace. There stood I, in a pile of sadness, swings and slides all around, alone, and she, having moved on, would toil no longer in my presence.<br /><br />Today, all so many years beyond, I do not remember if it was her kickball skills, or the way she whispered, "Green Eggs and Ham," ever so flirtatiously, just within earshot. Her gentle words were never meant for me no matter how I thought her eyes caught mine, and with clarity, at recess, I was reminded of her tease.<br /><br />Recess would pass into lunchtime, and as the bell rang, I blew out the door and ran the quarter mile home. Anger, grief, all inside boiling, looking to be purged, pushed me homeward. Second grade happiness would be found where my mom made lunch.<br /><br />Resting on our kitchen table, steaming with freshly ground pepper, was the golden orange macaroni and cheese. A bit of butter and a few drops of milk converged with the cheese for the smooth-sweet-salty taste with which I could indulge my insatiated heart.<br /><br />My mother, forever smiling, and me, upset at Heidi who was forever guiling, until soon, I, with my belly full, was no longer riling. Fair maiden was never won by macaroni and cheese, but my broken heart was oft-mended by its flavor.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/summary: Make it even better!
review/text: My kids love their Macaroni & Cheese but one day all we had was a generic brand.  They didn't eat it all that well (Kraft really is the best) so I decided to try to make it a little better for them.  Follow the recipe on the box with a couple exceptions.  Put one slice of velveeta chees in while melting the butter (I melt the butter while the noodles are draining so as to melt the butter and velveeta faster) and add 1/3 cup milk.  What you'll have is a less expensive version of the really creamy macaroni and cheese that Kraft sells for a lot more money.  By adding extra milk and cheese they're even getting more calcium.  My kids love it when I throw in hot dogs and even peas so feel free to throw in other things since it's so cheesy (the extra cheesy sauce will take things like peas that kids don't normally eat and make them taste good).  Give it a try and see what you and/or your kids think!

review/text: Was recommended this product by my acupuncturist to help with sleep and to keep the body 'regular.' Been taking Natural Calm Plus Calcium for 3 nights now. I am a small person, so only started with a half a teaspoon. I put it in Decaf Green Tea and take it before bed. It tastes fine, a little sweet. Now it's Day 3, and I don't know if this is one of those products that require 8 hours of sleep, but I feel foggy and exhausted, and have that 'sleeping pill' feeling, like I took a sleep aid but didn't sleep enough. (I sleep about 7 hours a night.) It's really not pleasant.<br />Am willing to try it some more, and will also be trying just the 'plain' Calm without the Calcium, Potassium, and Boron. Maybe those are messing with my head, not sure. Yesterday afternoon I was feeling funny, nauseous and also foggy in the head. I will say that I am sleeping more soundly at night, but to wake up feeling this groggy, and to have it last well into the morning is not fun. I will be testing more, but it seems to be doing funny things to me.

review/summary: Fibromyalgia
review/text: I had been enduring an agonizing week-long episode of what appears to be a fibromyalgic Tetany Syndrome of excruciating pain radiating from hip-joint to knee-joint along the muscles between the joints. In trying to describe to myself the electro-convulsive nature of it, I said it appeared to be like a fibrillation - only deep in my hip, and immediately the word "magnesium" popped into my mind. Dunno why.<br /><br />Tottered out to kitchen and One teaspoon of Natural Calm and 20 minutes later the convulsive constant spasms stopped. I was free from pain and able to sleep. Have had to keep a steady repeated dosage to keep the spasms at bay and it is difficult to admit that I probably have Fibromyalgia, but thank God for a remedy to the pain.<br /><br />I've kept the Natural Calm in my cupboard because of a peculiar muscle flutter/twitch I would get around the eyes when magnesium levels were low. Know this is just an anecdotal tale, but screaming pain one moment and no pain 20 minutes later, only difference being the magnesium is a tale that needs to be told.

review/text: I purchased Natural Vitality's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE">Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon 16 oz</a> as a magnesium supplement to help me absorb calcium better because I was diagnosed with osteopenia--precursor to osteoporosis.  I will have to wait until my next bone density test in about a year and a half to find out if adding this readily absorbed magnesium product has helped my bones.  In the mean time, however, it has helped with my chronic constipation.  I had been using stool softeners for the past couple of years and this works much better.  It is a powder which you mix in a cup of hot water and stir.  I usually take 5 grams (a heaping teaspoon) once a day.  After it is dissolved, I add a little cold water so I can drink it quickly, although it does taste good.
