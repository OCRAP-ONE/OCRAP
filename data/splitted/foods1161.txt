review/summary: Count your K-Cups
review/text: Thanks to those who mentioned being short changed on their shipments. For the first time, I counted the K-Cups. Glad that I did, 5 cups short. Quick email to Amazon should take care of the problem. My 20 required words about Emeril's Big Easy K-Cups is that they are my favorite possibly only 2nd to Starbuck's Verona.

review/summary: Emeril's Big Easy Bold K Cup
review/text: I have been getting this coffee for well over a year.  The coffee is greatand the price is reasonable. The subscription service is great and easy to manage.  I would have given it five-stars except that over the past 3 or 4 months some of the K Cups have been apparently defective and and don't always work.  Not many...but enough to mention.

review/summary: COUNT THE K-Cups
review/text: The coffee itself is awesome.  Good, strong taste.  It is the only kind I order.  However, I counted the k-cups this time since the box you see is all they come in.  They are dumped in there.  I decided to count them this time and I only received 45 k-cups not 50.  I called Amazon and they refunded me 10% which is what the 5 cups were worth.  I feel they should have done a little more for the trouble, but I won't make a deal out of that.  Just make sure you count them when you open the box.

review/summary: Lousy quality control for k-cups
review/text: The coffee is not bad, but the production quality is hopeless.  The seal that holds the cup lids to the plastic cup consistently fails, spewing hot water and coffee grounds all over the place.  I've written to the Canadian distributor (Timothy's Canada -- [...]), but to date they haven't even bothered to say "sorry" or even "tough luck".  Summary: the coffee isn't worth the hassle, as there are all kinds of other decaf k-cup products out there that taste as good, if not better. And it is disheartening in the extreme to have to deal with a supplier that cares so little about their customers.

review/summary: How Could You Be So Bold
review/text: After FINALLY purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">the best coffee maker</a> I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a "to each his or her own" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the "Midnight Magic" brand; I've tried the "Jet Fuel" brand; I've tried the "Donut Shop" brand; I've tried all of the "Extra Bolds"; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!

review/summary: This is good, but it's far from the best.
review/text: Don't mean to be the one who rains on the bandwagon (pardon the metaphor crash), but, while it is definitely true what other reviewers have written -- that the coffee is very strong, very thick, and very dark (add in an acid level commensurate with the sludge-factor) -- I don't find the taste all that strong, and taste is important.<br /><br />True, these K-Cups will provide a pleasant-tasting beverage the consistency and color of Louisiana mud, but for taste, one can do a lot better.<br /><br />Just for kicks, I had K-cups of coffee back-to-back today, one of this type and one of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1CC02">Keurig K-Cup "Mini-Brewers" Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold</a>, which is, unfortunately, sold out at the moment.  True, Newman's (RIP) is hardly as dark a roast or as thick a beverage, but the flavor punches through very robustly and is totally superior in the area that counts the most to me -- taste.  It's a lot "Bold"er than this brand.<br /><br />One of my favorite dark roasts is the Coffee People line, even of decafs, which truly bury the "Big Easy Bold" in the taste department, too, even if one drinks the decaf.  Diedrich coffees come to mind as well as clear winners.<br /><br />Maybe I'm spoiled, but I tend to use fewer of the ready-mixed K-Cups brand coffees than employing the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and selecting my own brand and grind.  My current favorite brand of coffee comes from a pair of small roasting houses in Washington state and Alaska.  I keep a couple days' worth ground and ready to put into the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>s, and there are few pre-packed ground K-Cups that can come anywhere close to the richness of the flavors and choices available if one "rolls one's own."<br /><br />I've got nothing against Emeril's, and it's a far superior cup of coffee to anything you'll get in most restaurants.  But, happily, we can best that effort without trying too hard.

review/summary: Best K-cup there is!!!
review/text: I have tried many varieties of k-cups and this one is by far my favorite.  Having said that, this cup of coffee is not for the faint of heart.  This is the strongest, boldest cup of coffee I have found.  It has almost a burnt flavor that I adore!  When this coffee is brewing the aroma is just about Heaven!!  If you prefer a more mellow blend I don't think you will like Big Easy too much, but personally I don't like the flavored cups which taste diluted to me.  You know you are drinking a strong, flavorful cup of coffee when you pop this in your machine.  It will stand up to cream, and is the perfect wake up beverage.  I love Coffee People French Roast, and Timothy's Rainforest Espresso, but I have to say they now taste almost ordinary to me after having discovered Big Easy Bold.  If you are looking for the boldest, most THERE cup of coffee you have ever prepared, you will not be disappointed,  Emeril Rules!!!!!

I make a traveler cup every morning and it takes (2) mediums on the B-60 brewer to fill it just right.  If you plan to make just one medium or large cup it will be just as advertised, "Extra Bold".  Great coffee.

review/summary: Makes a Great Latte - Here's How
review/text: I am a Latte fan - Starbucks has been by favorite for years.  Lately I've been tired of spending $4 a cup and having to drive to my local shop to get my morning fix so I started to venture into making them with my K-Cups.  I've tried out a few different brands and have found that this Big Easy Bold is great.  It is strong enough to keep a good flavor after adding my milk and flavorings.<br /><br />Here is how I do it:<br /><br />1 K-Cup - Emeril's Big Easy Bold<br />3 ounces of milk<br />1 tablespoon of cream<br />1 teaspoon  of sugar<br />optional: flavoring of your choice (cinnamon, caramel, chocolate, syrup etc.)<br /><br />In a microwaveable cup (at least 8 ounces)- warm the milk and cream for 30-45 seconds in the microwave on high.  In a large mug brew the K-Cup on the espresso setting.  Take a battery operated milk frother  like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KZUNK">Aerolatte Milk Frother, Satin Finish</a> and spin the milk until it is to your liking.  Add the teaspoon of sugar to the milk mixture when you have it almost finished.  Pour the milk into the mug with the coffee - stir just a tiny bit and you are ready to enjoy.<br /><br />If you choose to add the optional flavoring add it to the coffee before combining it with the milk.<br /><br />Enjoy - you will be surprised that it is actually better than you have had in the store.

review/summary: good, strong cup of coffee
review/text: I did a review in Feb. 2012 on a different size box of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, so I'm just cutting and pasting for this size box, because the product ordered was the same.<br /><br />First, let me say, I do not consider myself to be a coffee connoisseur or snob. I do not have a refined pallet. But, I do enjoy a good strong cup of coffee. The Emerils bold is exactly what I was looking for. I know there are always those out there that say, "nowhere close to my custom grind and French press." But, I use the keurig for the convenience and variety. The emerils bold is perfect for what I want - a good strong cup of coffee to start off my work day.<br />***********<br />Update 7/26/12<br />I've tried a couple other "bold" coffee's, just to compare. (Brooklyn Beanery Fugettaboutit and Jet Fuel) Not all bolds are the same. The other bolds seemed more bitter. (Some people think that bitter = strong coffee. Not true, strong coffee = good coffee, bitter coffee = bad coffee.) I'm done experimenting with different brands. For a good, strong cup of coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold will be my go to coffee from now on.<br /><br />Also, I just want to make one more comment on defective K-Cups. I see alot of reviews for both Emeril's and other K-Cups saying saying that they are horrible because 1 in every 3 explode in their Keurig machine. My wife and I go through 60 - 70 K-Cups per month, since December 2011. We've never had a problem with any of them. (when I say 60 - 70, they're not all Emeril's bold - we would be bouncing off the walls. We also use Caribou breakfast blend, decaf, green tea, heral tea, and hot cocoa.)

review/summary: Favorite keurig coffee
review/text: I've had my keurig for 4 years and it has been a love-hate relationship. I love the convenience and freshness of a single cup brewed quickly and effortlessly before my eyes but hate the weak, watery excuse for coffee that most kcups produce. Thankfully, I found Emeril's Big Easy Bold fairly early on or else my keurig would have landed in a garage sale. It is my favorite kcup. It has a strong coffee flavor with just the right amount of tang and bite that I enjoy. I do not like an ultra smooth cup of coffee any more than I do I weak one. Granted, Emeril's is not a perfect cup by any means and it does not replace the fresh ground, fresh brewed coffee I make when I have time on the weekends. However, it is an excellent compromise cup when I am rushing to get ready for work on weekdays.<br /><br />My only complaint is the new packaging Amazon has gone to with some of the kcups. They used to ship 2 of the original 24 count boxes that have the dispenser cut outs. Now they throw the kcups loose in a big cardboard box. Where I used to be able to stack and store the individual boxes in the cupboard, now I have to find a container large enough to hold 50 loose kcups without squashing them or having to pick them up off they floor when the tumbling out of the cabinet. Space is at a premium in my tiny apartment, and since I do use a few flavored kcups in a 1:1 ratio mix with Emeril's from time to time, I really miss the convenience of the small, stackable boxes.

review/text: If you like your coffee strong, you will like this.  There is a slightly bitter taste typical with most bold coffee (I guess).  I prefer a medium blend, however I can brew two cups from one kcup and get a cup to my liking.  So you might consider brewing two cups from one kcup and cut your cost in half.

review/summary: Goes down easy, nice finish
review/text: I am a fan of Dark Magic and since that was not available on Subscribe and Save I turned to Diedricht French Roast. French Roast was okay, it finishes a little bitter but I became used to that after a while. With the withdrawal of the Diedricht French Roast from Subscribe and Save I once again had to look for a substitute.<br />I turned to Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Big Easy Bold while slightly less 'bold' than Dark Magic, does not finish as bitter as the French Roast. So it has become my 'go to' coffee (at least as long as it stays on subscribe and save). I am usually not a fan of celebrity named/endorsed products as they rarely live up to expectations; however Big Easy Bold does.<br /><br />I am not a coffee expert; but I know what I like and I like Big Easy Bold.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: I tried Emeril's Big Easy Bold after purchasing a Keurig which came with a variety pack of K-cups.  I have to disagree on the great reviews of this coffee.  Honestly, it tastes like bottom of the pot, truck stop coffee that has been sitting for 4+hours.  It IS thick and strong (and exceedingly bitter).  If you like a smooth, full flavored coffee this one is not for you.  In the variety pack, Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend was one of the best.  Neuman's Own Dark was good too.

review/summary: Actually Bold Coffee
review/text: I can't say that Emeril has sponsored a product I like until now. For a K-Cup this coffee is actually close to the flavor that I like in rich freshly ground coffee. I like my coffee strong, and this one delivers where most other "Strong" or "Bold" cups have failed in my opinion. I am only giving it 4 stars, because even though it is the bold K-cup I have tried, I still left wanting bolder. Until that time, when I have time, I will just use fresh ground coffee in my cheap coffee maker. For the everyday brew this product helps me power through.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Actually lives up the the Bold name<br />+Boldest K-cup I have found<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Still not near ground coffees boldness<br /><br />Overall, it is a great product. If you have a stronger K-cup you are currently using in rotation I recommend trying this one. It cost about the same so risk it for a new flavor.

review/summary: Very good coffee, great if you like bold blends
review/text: I was slightly skeptical because of Emeril's name on this product.  He seems to endorse just about anything.  I was plesently surprised to find this as a very good coffee.  My wife enjoys bolder flavors and she quickly went through this package.  It's especially good if you like iced coffees, the bold flavor stays and only becomes slightly watered down.

review/summary: Delicious, great for the morning
review/text: I purchased these K-Cups for myself at our office based on the low price per cup. I didn't have very high expectations as these are roughly half the cost of most K-Cups. Despite not having much hope for this product to be any good, I am extremely happy with it! My coffee mug is extra large and I usually run each K-Cup twice, once on medium and once on small, to fill my mug. The flavor is strong and appealing, and the caffeine boost is welcoming. When I brew a cup, the aroma fills the office and my co-workers gravitate towards the machine to make their own coffee with their twice as expensive K-Cups.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product based on its value-to-cost ratio!

review/text: I can purchase an 18 pack of these at Target for $11.99 (that's $0.61/cup) instead of the much-too-high $0.85 per cup price here. Beware Amazon Prime members....K cups aren't a good deal on Amazon, despite the free two day shipping.<br />The coffee itself is GREAT. I basically like a cup of mud, as bold as it gets. This is that, with a great burnt taste and wonderful aroma.<br />HIGHLY recommend the coffee, but get it at Target.

review/summary: A good strong , not bitter coffee
review/text: Though one k-cup arrived partially opened allowing the coffee grains to spill into the box.  But considering I got this for only $24 on sale, no big deal.  If you like a nice strong French roast style, this coffee is for you.  No bitterness at all.  This brew is smooth and full bodied, even on the larger cup choice of my Keurig.  Most coffees I have to brew on the smaller cup choice.  Wish this came in decaf, but until then I can only have one cup in the morning as I am very sensitive to caffeine.

review/text: This flavor coffee is the only one I can find that is strong enough to handle the large mug size without getting weak.  It took forever to be shipped, though.  Waiting a full weekf or your coffee is not convenient.  The purpose of ordering it online is to avoid a trip to the store and it took so long to arrive I couldn't wait.  I ordered it before and it arrived within 3 days without shipping charge.  Very disappointed about that.

review/text: Emeril! I've never really seen him on TV  since I don't watch food stuff generally but I kinda know his catch phrases for some reason. I know celebrity products are just celebrities tasting products and deciding to put their name on them. After my last bad bought K-cups which were 3 dollars cheaper but ended up being instant coffee (Grove Square), I'll give this 5 stars for being real coffee with real flavor and nice strength to it! Cheers Emeril!!<br /><br />Bought this are Target for a few cents less than 12 dollars. It was an 18 pack. Not a bad deal with 18 REAL cups of coffee and not watered down stuff.

I have not had issues like some of the other reviewers with the actual Cup itself.<br /><br />I would give 5 Stars - but Costco has Tully's French Roast K-Cups in bulk as well as Tully's Kona Blend - and I do prefer those when the price is right.

Honestly I don't think he even tasted this coffee much less called it Bold.  Its not bold, its got a bad after taste, its weak even on the smallest cup setting.  If you like weak coffee, and I mean weak, this is for you.  In all honestly the Folgers K-cup is much better. So far this is the 2nd worst I have tried.  Not bold, how about "Emerils Big Sissy Coffee"!

review/summary: double brew it
review/text: I like bold but not bitter coffee. And since I add a generous amount of cream and sweenter this coffee works well for me. Yes, it is much too strong if I try to drink it black.  Actually, I "double-brew" it and it comes out perfect. I run the K-cup through on the "medium" setting and then run the same K-cup through again on the "small" setting and it comes out perfect. Perhaps that doesn't make me a true "bold" coffee drinker, but I love the flavor that results. I would recommend people try the "double-brewing" method if you find that some of the K-cups are too strong for you.  You get more coffee with  just one K-cup.

review/summary: Very Good Coffee
review/text: My wife just gave me a Cuisinart K-cup coffee maker for Christmas, and I was very happy until I tried the so called "extra bold" k-cups that came with the machine.  It tasted much too weak.  We bought some decaf for her at the store, and it was worse.  As much as I liked the concept of the machine and the ease of brewing coffee, I was prepared to return it.  We went to the store today and I saw Emril's Big Easy Dark Roast K-Cup and decided to give it a try.  To give it a fair shot, I was going to set it on 8 ounces as I had the other coffees, but I forgot to put the maker on that setting, and it was at 10 ounces.  What resulted was a great cup of nice and strong coffee.  If this is not strong enough for you, you must be drinking "battery acid" coffee like some people I know do.

As far the taste -- who knows with the coffee grounds in the cup.<br />Try a different type of Kcup and save yourself the money.

review/text: Excellent. Rich, dark and earthy. I was disappointed by the usual K-cups, which gave me thin, bland :meh: coffee, but saw that Emeril's coffee got good reviews here, and by God, they're right. I still feel guilty about the waste involved with this system, but if you;re going to use Keurig coffeemakers for their convenience, and want coffee deserving of the name rather than weak bitter swill, look no further.

review/text: Excellent dark/strong coffee.  Seems like I'm like a lot of the other reviewers here who are fans of this one.  Others that I like are Coffee People Jet Fuel, Van Houtte Extra Bold Dark, Coffee People Extra Bold French and Black Tiger, but this one is my standard.<br /><br />I have this on subscribe and save for every other month which was a great deal, but I was running low and was going to ship my next shipment early and saw the price jumped to $28.80.  Even with the 15% S&S discount, you're at $24, which is $0.50 a cup.  Hope this is just a temporary price bump.  The Emeril's decaf is still at $23 before S&S.  Might have to switch to the 50 pack Jet Fuel in frustration free packaging ($18 after S&S).

review/summary: Replaced my home-brewed Dunkin
review/text: I loved my daily brewed pot of Dunkin Donuts Original Blend coffee and was skeptical about the Keurig system. In July, I had my first Keurig cup at my daughter's home in Virginia and was pleasantly surprised. Quick, convenient, and most important, consistent with every cup. She had several varieties to try and I'm ashamed to admit I burned through most of those in short order. As the k-cups dwindled, we looked online for other varieties, but discovered Newman's Own Extra Bold was available at BJ's. I bought that to replace her stock and was very happy with it. I liked the Keurig system enough to order one myself and in late August came home to set it up. I ordered Newman's, two Green Mountain varieties and a bold sampler box to try other coffees. I thought Newman's was going to be my go-to morning cup, but was quite surprised by Emeril's Big Easy Bold and how much it tasted like my brewed pot of Dunkin. Just today, I ordered on the Subscribe and Save offer from Amazon and I am happily set up with my morning brew.<br /><br />Further observations from reading all of the previous reviews here:<br /><br />I did try using Dunkin in the My K-Cup filter that Keurig sells. It did not taste like my Dunkin coffee. I think that the brewed Dunkin derives some of the body from sediments you get from brewing by the pot.<br /><br />I agree that this is better than Starbucks because I've never had a Starbucks coffee that didn't taste burnt. If you're looking for a Starbucks match, IMO, this isn't the coffee you're looking for.<br /><br />I specifically wanted to address Dunkin coffee because I love it and it wasn't mentioned in any of the reviews. I mistakenly thought that Donut Shop and Donut House would be similar to Dunkin, but was sorely disappointed to find out they were not.

review/text: Others may love this k cup but I found it way too bitter.  I have to admit I don't drink that much bold coffee but have had a chance to try a few others and don't care for this one.  My Keurig only has the 8oz capacity and I took a cue from other users and run the bold k cups through twice to make 12 to 16 ounces depending on the type coffee.  Well even if I run this through twice at a total of 16 oz it is still too bitter... just not my k cup of coffee I guess but I do like Donut Shop and Newman's Own Extra Bold.

review/summary: Perfect if you only want one strong cup
review/text: I use one k-cup to make 8 oz of coffee and it's just the right amount and strength for one little pod of creamer.  The men in my family prefer milder coffees but I like it strong (I'm the grandmother).<br /><br />I'm adding this note months later with a different perspective.  Having tried almost every k-cup made, I judge this coffee as the most harsh.  Although I still prefer strong coffee to weak, I'd recommend this one only to people who like Army coffee.  For a good strong cup of coffee, I recommend either Timothy's Rainforest Expresso or the Obama coffee.

However, after my excitement while tearing open the box, I felt like the "BAM!" was the blow of disappointment as I smelled the coffee brewing.  To my dismay, the taste of the coffee was totally bland, and not really distinct in any way.  This box turned me off to buying any of Emeril's coffee products.  I'll stick with my utterly perfect, always there for me Dark Magic, thank you very much.<br /><br />Don't worry Emeril, I'll still be buying the next edition of your cookbook.  I'll just skip over any of the liquid sections.

review/summary: Emeril Doesn't Know Beans
review/text: If coffee is not a dark roast I pass it by.  There was a sale on Emeril's plus I had a 30% off coupon [should have known better].  While I was not expecting a French or an Italian level of dark roast, I was anticipating a decent cup of coffee.  "Big Easy" is a misnomer for "Big Zero."  When I add a tablespoon of half&half and the color of the coffee goes to tan, that's telling about the darkness therein.  That's what happened here.  Then I went on to the taste:  this stuff is weak with a bitter undertone; and then, oddly, it tastes, as the first sip goes down, as though water was added.  I use the 5 ounce side of my Keurig.  Can only imagine that the large cup would be right up there with dishwater.  I will slug down the remaining 17 kcups, but will never purchase again.

I use the 3.7 oz setting on my Keuring machine - anything more than that dilutes the finished product resulting in a watered down cuppa. (I'm not 100% satisfied with the Keurig system in general, but it IS convenient.) Thank you, Amazon for carrying both Emeril's coffees and delivering them to my door. Easy!

review/summary: I have 6 favorites, this is one of them
review/text: This review is going to get posted in 6 places, as I'm indicating my preferences for 6 different coffees. If you like one, maybe you will like the other.<br /><br />Regarding coffee, I like strong and smooth.  I don't like French roast as I find it too harsh, but I do like Italian roast.  Kona is great and I like Hazelnut, Vanilla and Chocolate flavors.<br />I drink my coffee with probably too much (at least 2-3 creamer containers worth to a 12 oz cup coffee) of evaporated milk in it or plain non-dairy creamer. No sugar.<br /><br />That being said...my favorite coffees are:<br /><br />Green Mountain Hazelnut Dark Roast Extra Bold<br />Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee<br />Newman's Own Extra Bold<br />Tully's Coffee Kona Blend Extra Bold<br />Folger's Gourmet Vanilla Biscotti<br /><br />and a special mention for<br />Timothy's World Coffee German Chocolate Cake - It has an almost coco-nutty taste to it. Not the deep chocolate taste I was looking for, but the best I have found so far. Please if you can suggest a Dark Chocolate Flavor coffee to me; do so.<br /><br />Also since I have posted a review about a Senseo coffee and now clearly have switched to Keurig a bit about why... if you're interested..which why I put it last.  Feel free to ignore it.<br /><br />We decided to get a Keurig coffee maker after enjoying the Senseo system for over 3 years.<br />Please note, since we got the Senseo system essentially free, not much thought was put into it's purchase. However it did introduce us to single serving coffee systems.<br /><br />We switched to the Keurig system from the Senseo for several reasons.<br /><br />1. Local availability of coffee. For some reason the Senseo system was waning here at the Rochester NY grocery stores and what good is a coffee maker without coffee?  Yes, you can buy online, but sometimes when your planning isn't the best, you might run out. What coffee they did carry was limited and not our preferences.<br /><br />2. Online purchases of Senseo coffees  were either for 4 bags of 16-18 of one variety or 4 bags of a mix of coffees. Invariably there was a few you didn't like.  I never saw small quantities of 5 or so.<br /><br />3. The Senseo "duck" for filling  with your own coffee never worked for us.  I'm an engineer and my boyfriend is an inspector. We literally did controlled experiments to get this to work and never could. Maybe we had a faulty unit, but based on reviews here, we were in good company. I knew many that had luck with the Keurig system however and we did as well.<br /><br />4. Once you open a bag of Senseo pods, they are starting to go stale, by virtue of being open to air. The Keurig system's coffees remain sealed and you can have many flavors "open" at once. Yes for those of you that are "green" there is more plastic waste. However I'm being selfish here and am being more concerned with the green in my pocket and fresh coffee.

review/text: I, too, think the 25% price increase for Big Easy Bold is out of line.  But I disagree that the increase in the commodity price of coffee can justify it.  The overall amount of coffee in k-cups is not large enough to have driven such a big increase.  My other favorite k-cups are going up "only" 16%.  I don't get it, and I'm not buying it... even though I enjoy the product.  I, too, cancelled my order.  So 1 star for the sticker shock!

To give you an idea of what my taste runs to, I also drink Gloria Jean's Black Gold, Coffee People Black Tiger, and Tully's Italian Roast along with an occasional Van Houtte's Honduran.  However, Emeril's was my standard cup.  But this latest bunch is nearly tasteless and watery!  It used to have a great aroma, full body, and was easily drinkable.  The only reason I didn't score it lower was because it is still not bitter or has a bad after taste.<br /><br />I am not sure what to do now.  I just put this on auto renew when I got this batch. I'm kinda' scared to keep on getting it, if it is going to stay this way. I might just cancel it and drink more Black Tiger (the most similar IMHO).  Too bad; I have frequently seen coffee quality from the same brand change in my life- and not only in the k-cups.<br /><br />Update: I tried using this on my 7.5oz instead of 9.5oz setting, and it is somewhat better.  However, it is still not nearly as flavorful as it usually was on 9.5oz.  I am really puzzled why more people have not experienced this; maybe my taste buds are growing Old? ;o)  However, my other coffees still taste the same.

review/summary: a little sharp...
review/text: This was my first time trying this brew of Kcup. It is ok, but the flavor is a bit acidic. I like a bold brew, even though I do add cream and Equal. When using this Kcup, I found I used at least one extra sweetener packet and twice the half & half. Friends of mine have enjoyed this flavor, however.<br /><br />I'd like to find a brand of kcup that is similar to Newman's Own, extra bold.  I have found this brand on Amazon, but it is through outside sellers, so not eligible for subscribe & save. The price through these vendors is also nearly twice the price of most of the kcups offered on amazon. So, for now, I will keep trying different varieties of kcups and trudge to Walmart to buy boxes of Newman's Own Bold 18 kcups for $10. If I see them on Amazon, I'll probably order several boxes.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I expected more with this chef's name on this product, but the flavor was blah. I even thought the first cup I tasted was a little fishy in its flavor. Tastes like a cup I would expect from Folgers and other common brands.

review/summary: Way bitter
review/text: This isn't horrible.  I still drink it, but I am never going to buy it again.  For starters, its WAY bitter.  I normally like dark black/bold coffe, but this has a bitter finish that is not very appealing.<br /><br />I've tried most of the k-cup coffee, and I think Caribou's Blend coffee is probably my favorite.  On the lighter end of the scale, the Coffee People's Donut Shop coffee is also pretty good.
