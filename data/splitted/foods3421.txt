review/summary: My Pup Loves it!!
review/text: My pup loves it!! The minute I open my amazon package he smelled the bones! He instantly sat and waited patiently for me to open the pack of Smartbones.<br /><br />I am so glad I finally found a better alternative to rawhide. I feel more ease at heart leaving the house with this treat in his paws.<br /><br />The only reason I am giving it four stars it's because my pup was able to finish quite quickly. Otherwise I am very happy with this product and it actually smells yummy. The smell reminds me of sweet milk.

review/summary: Definite After Taste
review/text: I love coconut flavor and was hoping to use this as a low carb, sugar free flavoring for my coffee but it just didn't taste that good to me. It has a definte after taste that the more I drank, the worse it seemed to become.<br /><br />Lots and lots of times I'll read reviews about products that have an unpleasant after taste to them but at least 90% of the time, I disagree so I don't think I'm uber sensitive to such things.<br /><br />Even though I didn't like this in my coffee, I tried it in some sugar free cocoa and it wasn't bad. The chocolate seemed to mask the after taste better than the coffee. Maybe this would be good in iced drinks?? I might try that later this summer but in the mean time, I don't think I would buy this again.

review/summary: Sweet, Sour, Chewy and a Deal!
review/text: I first tried these through my niece, as it was something I wouldn't normally buy on my own and I was immediately HOOKED. I am somewhat of a candy fiend and these quickly became one of my favorites. Unfortunately I couldn't find them in my local stores and had to resort to picking them up when I visited my sister. Then I decided to try Amazon and voil&agrave;! Not only did they have them in Apple, but they also had <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UHCC9U">Cherry</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UHCC86">Strawberry</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UHAMD8">Blue Razamatazz</a>.<br /><br />I like the combination of EXTREMELY sour when you first bite one, then eventually sweet and chewiness like hard licorice. I will continue to buy here on Amazon and I also look forward to trying out different flavors once I've finished off this box.<br /><br />Oh and if you already know you like the ropes, try the straws they're just as good.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FEA2CW">Sour Punch Straws, Strikin' Strawberry</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FED3VY">Sour Punch Straws, Blue Razamatazz</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FEF0FQ">Sour Punch Straws, Cherry</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UHAM5Q">Sour Punch Watermelon</a>

review/summary: Packed with Nutrition
review/text: This rice is good and very nutritious. It doesn't swell or fluff like white rice or parboiled rice. A cup of this is a lot for one person and could last 5-7 days. That is good if you have plans to eat rice for a whole week. Don't be fooled by it's size. This rice has a lot of fiber and other nutrition so it fills you quickly. Only about four scoops of a regular size spoon (a size up from soup size) is enough. I added a little bit of concentrated coconut cream to it and ate it with baked chicken; vegetable aren't needed. I went to the toilet often after eating this for three days. If you eat too much of it it may cause you to have pasty, constipated-like stool. This rice goes perfect with poultry (chicken, turkey, duck, goose, quail, etc...)Coconut cream was optional for me and I'm glad I tried it; however, a little sprinkle of salt will go a long way.

review/text: This is an excellent rice, it tastes fantastic and it is loaded with nutrients and antioxidants. It is a short grain rice, it cooked up beautifully in our Cuisanart rice cooker and the taste is fantastic. It says nutty and it is, a perfect match with the broccoli swordfish dinner we had. I would highly recommend this rice and I am amazed at the press this rice is getting from all the alternative health sources I read. I wont go into its nutrition stats here, check that out yourself as it is continuing to evovle BUT flavor! You have a winner here and I have yet to find a better price for black rice than this brand and the quality is excellent. Enjoy and be healthy. GOD bless JB

review/summary: STOP, Read my review before consuming this product
review/text: Ask a Chinese friend about "forbidden rice" (&#31105;&#31859;), unless they are history buff like myself, they will give you a puzzled look.  The term refers to an obscure trade policy during Manchurian dynasty, not an exotic rice.  I will not going to bore you  with history here.<br /><br />The story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in America, like the legion of fortune cookies. Most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near Atlanta.  We trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat.  "Forbidden rice?"<br /><br />There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean.  The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture.  The color does not come off easily.  You can get them from Chinese grocery store.<br /><br />What is sold as "forbidden rice" at Amazon and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color.  It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished.  Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off.  And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail.  When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent.  If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with using food coloring.  But is the ink FDA approved?  We do not know.  The label does not say.<br /><br />I am returning mine to Costco.  I will ask Costco to pull it off the shelf.

review/summary: Forbidden Rice not that great
review/text: I got some of this Forbidden rice at my local Harris Teeter, the packaging is thin and with only minor handling the bag sprung a leak.<br /><br />We cooked the rice in our Rice Cooker set to the Brown Rice setting, it was chewy with kind of a nutty flavor. Certainly its different from White rice, but to me it wasn't all that different from Brown rice or some other steamed grains that we've tried.<br /><br />Unless I had a recipe that called for it, I wouldn't buy this again.

I even mix the plain in with the Honey Nut and it is still good. I would recommend that anyone having a problem with there local stores not carrying this Post Cereal.

review/summary: My all time favorite beverage! Super Yum!!
review/text: I was at a convenience store a few weeks ago that happened to have the pink grapefruit Perrier. I decided to give it a try on a whim - usually I prefer unflavored sparkling water - and I fell in love!<br /><br />I don't like sweet beverages and many of the flavored sparkling waters leave an odd after taste, almost an artificial chemical type thing. I don't get this with the pink grapefruit at all. Instead it creates a wonderful balance between the light, tangy, grapefruity taste and the sparkling bubbles. There is no sweetener added at all, just the very light grapefruit taste.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flavored sparkling water. YUM!

review/summary: BEST THING I'VE EVER TASTED
review/text: WARNING: If you drink this, you will never ever want to drink anything else again.<br /><br />I never write reviews. Especially for food, let alone a beverage.<br /><br />I happened upon this beverage by accident. My boyfriend and I love Perrier and we discovered this flavor during an out of state trip to see his parents. It was so good we searched across the internet to try to ship it to our home state, but without luck. Turns out we couldn't find it b/c we were searching "pamplemousse rose" the original labeling. My genius boyfriend decided to search for grapefruit :-) and he surprised me with a huge case.<br /><br />I know this sounds silly but I haven't even had Perrier since we discovered this flavor. It beats all of them and totally agree, you will never want soda after this.

review/summary: Perrier Water w/Grapefruit flavor
review/text: Love this stuff! Not sweet at all, more of an aroma. Just perfect for after a long run or on a very hot day. Packaging was fine for delivery although plastic wrap on bottles was a little fragile, fell apart when i picked up the case, plastic bottles fell loosely back into shipping box. Not much of a problem, simply an observation.

review/summary: Delicious nonsugary beverage
review/text: I've always loved the mineraly taste of Perrier, and I prefer the plastic bottles to glass. It seems more carbonated. Before trying this, I liked lime slightly more than plain, and disliked lemon. This is my new favorite.<br /><br />The other review was correct in saying the grapefruit is more of a smell than a taste. It's so subtle that you could pour tap water back into an empty bottle and get a similar level of flavor.<br /><br />Most importantly, it contains no artificial sweeteners. I dislike the aftertaste of all artificial sweeteners, including the small(er) amounts added to tonic and soda waters. This has none of that. Nor is it affected by or will affect your appetite for sweets. It's not that kind of drink.

review/summary: Perrier Grapefruit Water 16 ounce 24 pk case
review/text: This Perrier flavor (Grapefruit) has been very difficult to find locally other than in convenince stores (sometimes) and then only in single bottles.  I was very happy to find these in a 24 package from Amazon.  Ordered 2 cases and they shipped quickly.  They were packaged in a larger cardboard box and arrived fine.  Only negative was the original plastic wrapper around the case came apart while removing the case from the box - no big deal, just had bottles scatter across the floor (they are plastic so no danger).  Next time I will take them out expecting the wrapper to not hold the bottles.  Love this flavor more than the original, lemon or lime - but those are not bad either.

review/text: I had bought another brand previously to this one....Berry Farm or something like that but they were out of stock so I settled on this company and consequently having to buy a whole lot more.  This powder is pale in color by comparison and the flavor is not nearly as good with a bitter after taste perhaps from using too much woody stem.

review/text: Both my cats have a good quality dry food as their main staple, but enjoy sharing a can of Fancy Feast a day; it makes their peaceful lives more interesting, and gives them that extra motivation to wake me up in the morning.<br />Gourmet Seafood Feast is their very favorite flavor, but others that rank high are Fancy Feast Gourmet Chicken Feast and Ocean Whitefish and Tuna Feast.<br />The flip top can makes it easy for their sleepy mom to serve breakfast, and the smell though fishy is not bad at all. Perhaps it might do with some sour cream on crackers if your run short on canap&eacute;s during your next cocktail party.<p>The can states that its main ingredients are Ocean Fish, Liver, Meat By-Products, and Fish Broth. There are many other ingredients of course, as well as vitamin supplements. The can also states that Fancy Feast Seafood Feast &quot;Provides complete and balanced nutrition for the growth and maintenance of cats&quot; and recommends 1 can per  3 and 1/2  lbs. of body weight, and reminds us to &quot;Refrigerate unused portion&quot;.<br />Whether served in crystal or the plain white ceramic bowls my buddies Liddy and Mushka get, your cats will love Fancy Feast, and will thank you with satisfied purrs.

review/summary: Believe it or not, this is the best BBQ sauce on the market.
review/text: And I've tried them all.<br /><br />Maybe its the anchovies. Who in their right mind but these radio clowns John Boy and Billy<br />would put anchovies in barbecue sauce right! Well why not, most all good steak sauces and<br />Worcestershire have anchovies, and you cant make a decent Caesar Salad without them either.<br /><br />What this sauce does to food is amazing. For ribs and chicken it just doesn't get any better.<br />Not a real tomato taste like most mainstream BBQ sauce, and not a mustard flavor either like<br />you will find in Florida and South Carolina. And although JB&B are in North Carolina, its not<br />a traditional NC style sauce either and thank god for that cause NC BBQ is the most overhyped<br />and overrated stuff I've ever had. So they went in a whole new direction with this recipe<br />cause there's nothing else like it.<br /><br />I use it as a finishing sauce on the grill, or you can dilute it with water or vinegar and<br />use it for a marinade, even on steak. Its also great on rotisserie chicken and wings. If you<br />want more heat get the Hot and Spicy version. Its even better.<br /><br />BTW, my favorite recipe is for ribs using Emeril's Rib Rub and John Boy and Billy's Grillin<br />Sauce as a finisher. Great combination. Check the web for other more creative recipes like<br />The Spammer (one can Spam, one bottle Grillin Sauce and an oven) Hilarious.<br /><br />Edit: I see I'm being dissed by some guy in Atlanta that seems to know zero about BBQ sauce,<br />you can look at this bottle and see its not that sick sweet stuff you get from Kraft or KC<br />Masterpiece. And his comments about this sauce "not sticking to ribs",,,,,lmao. I doubt he<br />even knows how to cook. The point of this sauce is not to pour it on a plate of pulled pork,<br />where it really shines is as a finisher on the grill, and I can assure you that it will "stick"<br />to whatever you're cooking. Its not designed to drink out of the bottle, but caramelize it on<br />the grill and the transformation will reward you.<br /><br />Oh yeah, Mr Raines...you'd be surprised how many people in the South eat sardines and Vienna<br />sausages.

review/text: The previous reviewer said this sauce went in a "new direction" and he's right...straight to the do not buy again list. He likes it but he's also gave good reviews to vienna sausage and sardines. To each his own I guess. If you like a sweet ,smokey, thick traditional sauce......this isn't for you.<br /><br />I could maybe see using it on pulled pork or maybe chicken, but in no way would I use it on ribs. I don't think it would even stick to them. I've tried many many sauces of all flavors, textures and degrees of hotness. Some I've loved and others I can do without.<br /><br />Maybe their sweet and mild sauce would be better but I'll never find out.<br /><br />Spend your money on something else. There are many better choices out there.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: Not much to say about green beans other than they were clean, no extras like sticks or stones and packaged well.  Less than ten bucks a pound with shipping is a good price for small quantities.  Normally if my funds allow I buy around ten pounds and that gets the shipped price per pound down to around seven bucks for Costa Rican coffee. That's from a different vendor.  For a 1 pound emergency order I am very happy.  These are good beans for a decent price and they showed up on time.  How can you go wrong?<br /><br />Now that I've roasted these beans I have to update my review.  They are very good, same quality as the other online vendors.  While I don't have the best equipment I have been roasting for several years so I'm not just blowing smoke.  I roasted these past first crack to about 435 degrees. I like to bring them up slower than the 30 degrees per minute I see recommended all over the place online.  If you like the fruity flowery roasts that's a good speed.<br /><br />I like dark and nutty or chocolatey so I try to shoot for about 20 degrees a minute.  Not difficult in my hotrod air popper but quite a chore when indoors with my freshroast.  I know that nutty sounds funny when not going to second crack but it's all in the heat curve, you can get these earthy flavors from a lighter roast if you but take your time.<br /><br />There are candy bars that would love to smell as good as these beans after they were roasted.

review/summary: Pure dehydrated coconut but not dated !
review/text: It is indeed finely shredded. The pieces, of course, are all different sizes. I'd say the typical piece is about an eighth of an inch long or maybe 2mm if you speak metric, by a sixteenth of an inch wide, or maybe 1mm. Being dehydrated, there's a lot of it per package. Each 8 oz. package says it contains 2 2/3 cups. That's a lot of coconut shreds.<br /><br />Another aspect of being dehydrated is that it doesn't have a strong coconut taste like the fresh stuff would, but it does smell and taste real (in case you wondered). I wanted it for low carb, gluten-free Nonpareil Trail Mix I'm concocting. Obviously the primary use would be baking, like macaroons, or maybe putting a frost on top of frosting on baked goods, like the package illustration. You can also use it to make your own coconut milk for use in Thai and Indian cuisine.<br /><br />Here's a real positive: This coconut is unadulterated. The package says, "Ingredients: Organic Coconut (shredded and dehydrated). Color may vary as this product contains no sulfites." NOTE WELL many producers add a chemical called Sodium metabisulfite to their coconut products, notably to the meat and milk, to "preserve whiteness". This you don't want. Google it. An outfit called Livestrong says that a fatal dose of Sodium metabisulfite is estimated to be 10 g for the average adult, and lists numerous other negative effects. When I ate a different brand of coconut that was laced with this poison, I suffered serious intestinal pain and then the runs. Causal relationship? Hmmm. Anyway, this Let's Do Organic Coconut is blessedly free of such chemicals.<br /><br />I would add a caution here, that if this finely shredded, dehydrated material eaten as is, that is to say dry out of the package, it could present a danger of aspiration (accidental inhalation). If a person were to breathe at the wrong time, it could "go down the wrong pipe" because it is so fine and light. This would apply to children and the elderly in particular, but could be a hazard for anyone. I also noted that it has a particular tendency to get caught between teeth.<br /><br />I can figure a reason for not dating a product and that reason is not in the best interest of the consumer. At any rate, I could find no marking tho' I searched carefully, except "EDO349" stamped right over the barcode on the package back. If that's a code date, it's meaningless to the average consumer. Dating is one of the first things I look for when I'm shopping in person. I guess this is a drawback of online grocery purchasing.

review/text: Since I like the Walden Farms salad dressings, I thought I would try this dip to eat with rice chips. However, when I tried just a little dip on a spoon, I decided not to waste a good rice chip. It had little bits of something in it that I think were supposed to resemble bacon bits. The only thing I felt they did was make the flavor of the dip linger in the mouth a little longer. While I have had worse tasting dips (like the Walden Farms French Onion Dip), I couldn't make myself eat any more than that taste. My advice to others would be to use your money to make a low cal bacon dip. Don't throw your money away like I did.

review/text: I was introduced to Gulden's Zesty Honey Mustard several years ago by a friend. At the time, it was available at Wegmans in NY, but alas they have stopped carrying it for some reason. I ended up buying the 6 pack when the price dropped enough (but was still about $5 per bottle after shipping). Also, it's mustard. It will be good probably until I use it all up, since I've never seen mustard go off.<br /><br />The supplier did a good job of wrapping it, although frankly they're non-shatter plastic jars and I would have liked to save a little bit on shipping instead, but it got to me pretty quickly and there weren't any problems so I guess it was worth it. I've tried other honey mustard sauces and none of them can really compete. The Wegmans store brand was decent but it was actually Dijon, which this isn't. Don't know what the Gulden secret is but I hope they never stop making it...

review/text: I was very skeptical about this pasta due to the low calories and high fiber. I thought that there was no way it would taste as good as Dreamfields which was the closest thing I have found to "regular" pasta. I was wrong and I will gladly eat my words (and this lasagna) It was excellent and it worked like a charm with all of my other healthy ingredients. I am following the WW program and since Lasagna is one of my favorite foods in the world, I was hoping I would be able to eat it and stay on my program and lose weight. We had it three times that week and I had one of my best losses to date on WW - 3.5 lbs!<br /><br />How can you not love eating lasagna and still losing weight? I am a convert and just ordered my second case of this miracle food. I did not buy it through Amazon, but directly through the company with an e-coupon and free shipping on orders over 75 bucks. I am a fan and will never buy regular lasagna noodles again. 130 calories and 18 grams of fiber in one serving? Since I generally eat two servings, this box is perfect for my husband and I for one meal, all without guilt. Excellent!

HOWEVER.. when I received the package one box was open and the pasta smashed in pieces.  It wouldn't be that big of a deal except its LASAGNA... Which kinda of requires a "whole" noodle not one smashed in many pieces to make useable.  Some boxes even though they are unopened you can tell they at broken as well just by moving the box around gently. The noodles I were able to salvage worked great but was bummed that there were so many that had to be thrown out.

I found a pasta sauce with no added sugar that was low in calories.  Sounds pretty disgusting, I know, but it was actually very good.  These noodles are firm with a very nice taste and consistency.  I would highly recommend them for any lasagna recipe.<br /><br />Fiber Gourmet pasta is the only pasta we now consume in our house.  I'm not a fan of the different flavors.  I like the basic spaghetti and the lasagna.  If you're a pesto fan, try Hungry Girl's pesto recipe.  It's very good as well.

review/text: These bags never close well, so if you are a compulsive bag-closer, forget about it. Ah, the taste you ask? Dry, and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form. Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original "Chips Ahoy!" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes.

These 1.4 ounce single servings make that easy without overdoing it. If I bring one with me I know I'll only end up eating one package and not HALF of a 12 ounce package! Single servings help keep the portion size healthy while not killing your soul by ignoring your need for some desert...<br /><br />Reasonably priced and shipped to your door, these are a great purchase.

review/text: Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces.  My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes.  If you like cookie dough, you most likely will enjoy these.  I'll stick with a crunchy, less sweet cookie.

review/summary: Are We Reviewing Our Mistakes Or These Cookies?
review/text: Wow.  So far, two two-star reviews.  One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of "calms" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not "crispy" cookies, or the blurb would say "crispy," rather than "chewy."  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order.

review/summary: Best and Most Effective Deodorant I've Used
review/text: Firstly, I have been using this specific deodorant for 4 years. I originally started using it when other products started to give me an under arm rash, I noticed this one said for "sensitive skin" so I gave it a try. Since I have been using it I have not got any more rash or redness. It has a nice, pleasant smell and is not overpowering. Actually, it is rather unnoticeable until you are actually perspiring, which is what I think deodorant should do. Like another reviewer stated, if I want to have a stronger smell, I will use cologne or body spray.<br /><br />Since I have used it for 4 years I have not lost one shirt to this deodorant... it does not stain. I thought I should mention this since another reviewer stated it stained all his shirts. Maybe he got a bad batch or has some sort of chemical imbalance...<br /><br />In summary, if you have sensitive skin and or other deodorants have been bothering you with there wild smells, give this stuff a try.

I occasionally get irritation from deodorant so chose this one with Aloe. It seems to help with the irritation. The scent is nice and mild, not overwhelming. I was in a situation where I wasn't able to shower for 24 hours and the deodorant never quit. I don't plan on that happening again but am happy to know if it does I wont stink lol. If this is your normal brand try the Subscribe and Save and see if its a savings for you.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />Amazon raised the price of the deodorant and is not longer competitive with local stores. Due to this fact I am no longer on subscription with this product. It's still a great product but no longer at a great price if you can get it locally.

I find that as I age, my skin seems to becoming more sensitive.  I was pleased and appreciative to 1) discover that Amazon offers this product (I couldn't find it locally; and, 2) to read that others had success using it.  To put it mildly, I was really uncomfortable after using other products.  As others have stated, it is non-irritating, has an unobtrusive fragrance that does indeed seem to only activate by rising temperature.  I had found comfort by using Colgate-Palmolive's Speed Stick "Pro Skin."  However, when I could no longer find that brand and called the company, I was told they had ceased manufacturing it. Trying Degree's Cool Comfort in the midst of this very warm summer leads me to highly recommend it.  Thanks Amazon!

review/text: It is very effective tool to get rid of bad odor. I can feel the good smell even 8 hrs after using it. My clothes smell good thanks to it. I would highly recommend it for the price they are being offered.

review/summary: The Only Deodorant I use.  It's the Best
review/text: I perspire heavily if I don't use an effective product.  I have spent much of my life searching for the best, most effective anti-perspirant for me.  Once I found Degree and specifically this scent, I have not wavered for years.  I now buy it by the 6 pack which lasts me about 6 months.  It works perfectly for me.  It is definitely worth a try.

review/summary: No itch
review/text: I tried this because of the "for sensitive skin" claim, and so far I am very pleased. With any other anti-perspirant I get itchy after 2 or 3 days and then I have to wait before I can use it again. I've been using this for a week now with no issues. Works great -- very subtle scent.
