review/text: I received a sample of your soft baked oatmeal cookies in my Mom VoxBox from influenster.  Within seconds of opening the box my kids were fighting over who would get it!  We all got a taste and it was delicious!  I really liked the flavor and just the right amount of sweetness.  I will definitely buy your product again in my local grocery or on amazon.

review/text: I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box.<br />As soon as I opened up the box, the cookie was on top. My 5 year old couldn't wait to get her hands on it.<br />She enjoyed every single morsel. And wanted more. So on my next food shopping day, I will definitely be picking up a box. GREAT JOB QUAKER!

review/text: Normally I'm not a fan of any cookie (other than Oreo) unless its right out of the oven. To me there's just that something extra when it's nice and hot. I took one bit of this thinking I'd be giving the rest of it to my 2 year old daughter. It was DELICIOUS!!! Needless to say, she didn't get any of the cookie. :o) Highly recommend and I will definitely be buying this again!!

Just all the yummy goodness.. We tried the Oatmeal raisin cookie and the raisin's were good, they were soft not hard..  Overall I would definitely would buy the Quaker Cookies again.. and would definitely buy another kind other than raisin as well.. I think YOU should try it out. :)

review/summary: I did find these to be quite good
review/text: Quaker Oats Company has been around for over 100 years, and with a track record like that you know that they are doing something right! These soft oatmeal raisin cookies are actually quite good. Each cookie weighs about 1.48 ounces, and is about 170 calories (27 grams of carbohydrates). So, while they are not exactly a low-calorie snack, they aren't too bad either.<br /><br />The nice thing about them is that they are nicely filling, making them a nice afternoon snack, when you need a little something to get you through work. And, while oatmeal raisin cookies are not my favorite snack, I did find these to be quite good. As a matter of fact, that's what I like about them being singly packaged, it keeps me from going back for more!<br /><br />(Review of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins)

review/text: No-one should do oatmeal better than Quaker ....right? Well they have been trying to expand from just the basic oatmeal for some time. These soft cookies are tasty and satisfying. In my family you can tell how good they are by how quickly they disappear. Weel - they disappeared in swift order. In fact I barely got to taste more than one. The general consensus is these are 'just like homemade. There is not greater compliment that can be paid. They are packaged conveniently for inclusion in school lunches etc. They certainly make a great accompaniment for tea or coffee for that unwinding moment all of us need at somour day.

review/summary: Soft and Dry
review/text: I like oatmeal and raisin cookies but I don't eat them very often.  That's probably because my wife makes such awesome chocolate cookies.  When I do get an opportunity to try an oatmeal and raisin cookie it is usually from a store-bought package.  I usually come away impressed with how moist these pre-packaged cookies are.  That's what surprised me most about Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie;  They're soft but they aren't moist.  There is a distinct soft dryness to the cookies. The taste was good and my grand daughter quickly ate up most of them.  She liked them because they are tasty and soft.  I agree and I guess two out of three criteria is good but I was looking for one more quality

review/text: Maybe it was the hot weather? Maybe it was the baking process?<br /><br />These cookies, although individually packed (so good for school lunches), came out a bit dry and crumbly.<br /><br />Sure, maybe I am just a messy eater but a soft baked cookie just not crumble as much as the cookies I got crumbled.<br /><br />Maybe if you get them at the supermarket they would be less dry.<br /><br />Maybe if is just a general problem with the way they are produced.

review/summary: Eh?
review/text: These cookies come individually wrapped and easy to stash in lunch boxes, picnic baskets, or give to the kids as an after school snack. However, I did not find them to be the most appetizing thing in the world - especially as an adult who is used to low cal or sugar free snacks. Kids hate them. I couldn't get mine to try more than one bite. Even as an oatmeal cookie, they aren't that good. We found them salty and bland. Yes they were soft, but also crumbly, which made a mess. I wouldn't say they are the worst I've ever tried, be definitely not as good as other Quaker products.

Each cookie is individually packaged and is easy to open on the go.<br /><br />I'd totally buy these the next time I see them in the store.

review/text: Quaker is pretty much the oatmeal company, and they have done a nice job with this oatmeal raisin cookie. I liked the convenience of being individually wrapped, which also preserves its freshness. I take one of these along during a round of golf and in my lunch. The cookie is tasty, light and moist. I recommend this to all cookie lovers, especially those fond of oatmeal raisin.

review/text: These large cookies greatly resemble in look and taste the ones you might get in a vending machine.  They are individually packaged and have a soft and chewy texture.  The taste left me pretty unsatisfied as they were pretty bland and tasted too "processed," not like simple and fresh oatmeal raisin cookies.  I would not recommend them personally, although my little ones liked them fine (although I rarely know kids to say "no" to a cookie!).

review/text: I was really excited to get this Quaker Soft Baked Cookie in the Oatmeal raisin flavor because this is one of my favorite flavors. Over all the flavor was fabulous with just the right amount of raisins, but I found it to be toooo soft. I do like soft cookies but I had a hard time eating this cookie because it was so soft it crumbled in my fingertips as I tried to take bites so I had to eat it over the wrapper carefully. I also let my 7 year old son and my 12 year old daughter try bites and they loved it and did not care that it was soft and crumbly at all. Overall I would recommend trying them because the flavor is good and maybe they are not all that soft.

review/summary: Very tasty cookie!
review/text: I recently tried this cookie as part of an Influenster Mom Vox Box.  Influenster sends out free boxes of products in order for you to test them and give them your feedback. I really enjoyed this cookie!  Most packaged cookies are hard and taste like cardboard but I was pleasantly surprised that this cookie was soft and comparable to a homemade oatmeal raisin cookie.  The nutritional facts weren't too bad for a dessert too.  It was very yummy and filling.  A good sized cookie!  I will definitely be buying some for my family, since I ate this one myself ;)

review/text: I received a free cookie from Influenster, and it made my week. I normally avoid packaged cookies because I like the chewy freshness of homemade so much better. These had an amazing flavor of cinnamon and spice, and the texture was perfect. I need to go get my own box!

review/text: I was given a sample of these Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster.com as part of their Mom VoxBox 2012 for reviewing. I shared my cookie with my 2 1/2 year old daughter. As with any cookie, she loved it! I thought the cookie was delicious. Not overly sweet, but had perfect flavor. It was moist too, unlike some cookies that are dry. My least favorite part was how crumbly it was. It did have a tendancy to crumble quite a bit. Overall, it was a great cookie.

review/text: I received this delicious treat complimentary of Influenster in my Mom voxbox. I did note that was in several crumbly pieces when I opened the package, but it obviously didn't change the taste of the cookie itself. It just made it a little messy to eat, but in my house with a toddler that is nothing new. Speaking of toddler, SHE LOVED IT! She actually wanted more after the package was empty, and was pretty upset when I kept telling her it was all gone. :) Looks like we'll be getting some more to have around the house and maybe a little bribery for the diaper bag. :)

review/text: I tried these cookies as a sample from influnster.com. They are a little sweet for my taste, the kids loved it. They are a good size, about the size of the palm of my hand. At 170 calories each, they are a little hefty to have more than one at a time, but since they are individually wrapped, no worries about waste.  Try them microwaved for about 20 seconds!

review/text: The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are delicious, I received a complimentary sample from Influencers to try the product and review it.  Well when the Vox Box that contained my complimentary products to try I opened it up infront of the mailbox, on the way up my driveway I ate my cookie.  I absolutely love that these are individually packaged yet a nice size cookie.  You don't feel deprived by throwing just one in your lunch box or purse, and certainly the kids love them.  I think they are very reasonably priced, and plan to stock up on a few boxes.  Perfect for the the beach when you want snacks yet don't want the seagulls attacking open food bags.  Not to mention they are a guilt free snack:<br /><br />-Made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats<br />-Individually packaged<br />-Provides a good source of fiber<br />-Contains 6 grams of total fat per serving<br /><br />Definite buy, if on sale stock up.

review/summary: tastes like homebaked cookies, just so much easier to "make"
review/text: I love these cookies. They have a wonderful chewy texture, a bursting with raisins and taste truly homemade. At first I was concerned the cookies may have picked up some of the flavor from the packaging, but the flavor, while helping to maintain the freshness of the cookies, had  no effect on the flavor. I love the baked through flavor of the cookies, they baked to perfection - not underbaked and certainly not overbaked because they are nice and chewy. I will definitely consider these cookies as a pantry item for when I need a treat, but did not have time to  bake cookies for the kids myself.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a Mom Voxbox through Influenster, which contained a sample of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. The opinion expressed herein are my own personal opinion and have not been influenced by Influenster or any other third party.

review/summary: Picky Eater loves them
review/text: I was one of the lucky moms out there that got picked to receive a MomVoxBox  from Influenster. When I opened the box my youngest son Jordan was sitting with me. Before I had a chance to see what it was he took it and ran off. I was surprised by this, but I opened it up for him and he ate it right up. See my son Jordan is Autistic and he is a very picky eater. He is also picky about his snacks. He hates raisins, I have never been able to get him to eat them . But he loved the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. Ever since we received these when he sees a Quaker cookie box we have to buy it he thinks they are the same cookies. These are so great they come in their own wrappers so you can take them when you are on the run and they are way healthier then most cookies out there.

What really impressed me was the sofeness and the taste was just awesome.  If I didn't know better, I'd think they came right out the oven. Lets not forget the wholesome ingredients it contain.  You couldn't ask for a better cookie.  If I didn't know better, I think my mom made these.

review/text: First let me say that I tried this product because I received it in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster as a complementary test product.  That said, these cookies are off the hook delicious.  They really do taste just like homemade (I know, because I make my own all the time).<br /><br />I only ate a bite because my son was chomping at the bit to have it and as soon as his little hands got ahold of this cookie, it was gone in seconds and he was asking for more.  We'll certainly be buying a box to keep for when it's just too hot to turn on the oven and make our own!

My youngest is not a morning person and is slow to eat, so these are great for him to just grab and eat on the way to school.<br /><br />Was so happy to get a sample of these in my MomVoxBox...thank you Influenster.

review/text: I will be going to get more of these tonight! My 15 1/2 month old son just loves them and I like giving them as an afternoon snack for him. They fill him up and give him the energy for more running around and they don't seem to bother his mouth since he's currently teething.

review/text: I was lucky enough to try this cookie in a Mom VoxBox from Infuenster. So glad they gave me a sample because I would have never tried it on my own since I don't really like oatmeal raisin cookies. This cookie was delicious, not too sweet, very soft and chewy and my 17month old daughter also loved it. These cookies will be found in my house from now on.

review/text: These were pretty great. We got the Oatmeal Raisin but to me they tasted like Pumpkin Pie which was even better. My husband and three year old liked them as well. Especially the three year old. These cookies were pretty great. Very dense so one is definitely enough. I want to try another flavor next time too! Maybe something with chocolate!

review/text: I recently received a sample of this cookie, and I enjoyed it!  The cookie was soft and not too dry.  It was a little spicier than I generally like my oatmeal cookies, but it definitely had some flavor. I wouldn't say that it's my favorite oatmeal cookie ever, but I would be very okay with eating more of them  :)

review/summary: Quaker Cookie
review/text: Upon recieving this cookie in my voxbox from influenster I sceptical because you expect cookies in a package to be very dry and more often than not tasteless, the cookie recieved in the package was surprisingly moist and very flavorful, it tasted very good and I will definately purchase them in the future.
