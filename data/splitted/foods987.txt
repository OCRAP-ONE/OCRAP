review/text: Usually I find decaf coffee to be too weak, but this product is an exception. It has a nice round full-bodied coffee flavor that isn't diluted by the flavored creamers I occasionally use in place of dessert. I would recommend this decaf above all others I have tried.

review/summary: Strong coffee lovers, rejoice!
review/text: This is some of the best decaf coffee I've ever had. Many of the other commonly-available decaf K-Cups are weak or too light a roast for my tastes. This product holds up to plenty of cream and sugar. I've even started making Irish Coffees with it! If you like espresso drinks (even Americanos or straight espresso), this may be the blend for you. Perfect for settling a late-night coffee craving and then going to bed moments later - still tired, with nary a spec of heartburn (as some of us tend to get from caffeinated dark roast blends).<br /><br />The only downside for me is that the jury is still out on the decaffeination process they use in the beans that go into this K-Cup. I'm guessing it is chemically decaffeinated since Green Mountain is not exactly forthcoming with the info (not on their website or on the box). Many K-Cups do use Swiss Water, but I've noticed some K-Cups also note chemical decaffeination on the side of the box now. This is a small price to pay for a great cup of coffee before bed, as far as I'm concerned... and if you're using a Keurig, you probably don't drink too many cups of coffee each day, either (and thus are limiting your exposure to any harmful side effects from the decaffeination process). Still, I would be happy to pay a bit more for a Swiss Water version of this product.

review/text: The Green Mountain Extra Bold Dark Magic decaf is a very good, strong coffee. It does have a slight bite, but then I like that in a coffee. Many decaf coffees have little to no taste, especially using K cups, but this decaf actually tastes like coffee! For those interested, the caffeinated version of the Dark Magic coffee is great too! That is why I ordered the decaf to try. I highly recommend that you give it a try.

review/text: I have been buying the Timothy's Decaf K-cups for a long time now.  I think my taste buds have gotten bored as recently, I drank some Starbucks Via Decaf and was shocked with how much better that was.  I did some searching and decided to try this Extra Bold to see if the Keurig could produce something with more flavor.  It did!  I really like this coffee and will use it as my daily drinker from now until I get bored again.  The bummer is that I bought this last week and it cost me about $12 less than what the price is today!

If you have to drink Decaf, be wary!  Luckily my husband drinks regular coffee and he can use this but I was really disappointed that it wasn't Decaf.  I had one cup and was pretty hopped up.

review/summary: Precooked was not the way to go...
review/text: I really wanted to love this item. I have ordered from Burgers before. Their precooked smoked turkey is excellent. But I did not enjoy this prime rib. Why? I bought the 4-5 lb roast for Christmas dinner. I let it thaw in the refrigerator for 4 days and then set it on the counter for two hours to bring it up to room temperature so it would reheat evenly. I followed the instructions that came with the roast, preheated the oven and let it cook for about an hour at 350 degrees. As I was busy preparing the rest of the meal I felt confident the prime rib would turn out fine since it was already cooked. As I was finishing up the rest of the cooking in that last dash of chaos to get everything out on time I finally checked the temperature of the meat and was shocked to find it was only 80 degrees in the center!<br /><br />I know for a fact the entire prime rib was thawed so there is no way it was still cold in the middle before I put it in the oven. I didn't panic. Since my guests were waiting and everything else was finished I had to get this meat up to temperature quickly (to at least warm) in the center without ruining the perfect red color of medium rare. Unfortunately that meant putting this beautiful and EXPENSIVE piece of meat in the microwave. I had to run it on high for 1 minute intervals, constantly opening and closing the door until I got the center to 110 or so - at least so my guests thought it was warmed through. Because of how big the roast was, that process took about 10 extra minutes. Obviously it is impossible to cook a prime rib evenly in the microwave so I ended up with overcooked ends, well done second and third slices and a slightly pink center.<br /><br />As for the taste...what were they thinking? I tasted like it was injected with highly concentrated au jus. Each bite was too salty for my taste and there was a heavy flavor of beef broth and rosemary. I wanted to taste the beef, not the seasonings. It reminded me a little of carved roast beef you get in a cheaper chain buffet restaurant or cafeteria like Golden Corral.<br /><br />Are there any positives? Yes, I can't say I hated it outright. The meat itself was tender as a prime rib should be and the flavor while a bit overpowering, was edible. In fact, my in-laws said they liked it a lot (but maybe they were just being nice). Also, it was much bigger than I thought - that's a good thing. It easily fed 6 people and there was enough left for another 5 or 6 more slices.<br /><br />But for the $115 I paid I probably could have had the same results from my grocery store meat case. Sorry Burgers. I like your products but you blew it on this one. I won't be buying a precooked prime rib from you again.

review/text: A surprisingly good green tea.  I usually drink loose leaf green tea, but when I need the convenience of a teabag this stuff is tasty -- and a steal.<br /><br />Different green teas required quite different soaking conditions.  For this tea:<br />1. You've got to make sure the water is cool enough.  I pour boiled water into one mug, let it sit for a few moments to cool a bit, then pour the water into a second mug, and then put the tea bag in.<br />2. Don't soak it for more than 2 minutes.  It becomes noticeably bitter if you do.

So if your looking for a very mild tea this one is worth checking out.  Keep in mind that you will be buying 500 tea bags at this price.

review/summary: Best green tea I've ever tasted
review/text: After my redelivery date for another green tea brand (Lipton) was coming up I was informed by Amazon that it was not in stock and wouldn't be for my delivery date, so I looked for some other option. So I saw this and on Subscribe And Save it was cheaper, but it had great reviews, so I decided to try it. All I can say is WOW! The other brand of GREEN TEA tasted more like just regular tea, and even looked like regular tea (by regular I mean the popular cheap orange peoke tea you get in restaurants and such) but this is actually GREEN, the flavor is nice and light, not bitter.<br /><br />I didn't really care that it was organic, I don't fall for that hype, but I believe the tea plant is very hardy so it doesn't take much to make it organic (as compared to other plants).<br /><br />At the current price ($25.24 Subscribe & Save) it works out to 5.1� per bag, which is a heck of a deal, throw in some ice and it's a great way to beat the summer heat!<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm not going back to the other brand after this!

review/summary: WORSE TEA EVER WITH OIL FLOATING ON TOP!!!
review/text: FIRST OF ALL, IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO BUY THIS TEA BECAUSE IT IS CHEAP AND ORGANIC, YOU SHOULD RETHINK AFTER READING MY REVIEW, BUY IT IF YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU LIKE THE SMOKE TASTE AND THE OIL FLOATING ON THE TOP FROM THIS TEA PRODUCT; IGNORE MY COMMENT AND BUY THIS.<br /><br />This is actually my first review on product that I have purchased, because it is a shock to me seeing all these great reviews about it when it is the worse tea I have ever had! I agree with the 1 star reviews for the most part, and if I could give it a 0 star I would.<br /><br />I know this tea is cheaper than most of the other organic teas, and being that it is organic, one would expect some high quality tea. BUT THIS TEA IS HORRIBLE. Like many others, I like the idea of it being organic, and to decrease in the amount of chemicals and shit I put into my body. However, yesterday when I made my first cup of tea with this tea bag, there were oil residue floating on the top, and the tea taste like smoke!<br /><br />Today, I told myself, why not give it another try? It might be my cup's problem yesterday. Ah ha! same thing happened, the oil slowly emerge to the top again! And I know it for a fact because I always stare into my cup when I am drinking something. I even conducted several experience with the tea bags by using different temperature water (I guess it is a wise way to use up rest of the tea bags, since I refuse to drink this tea any longer). I was hoping to find something different, but every cup had the same kind of oil residue floating. It is disgusting!<br /><br />Now I am still stuck with many tea bags left, and I don't even know if this cxrxaxp is good for me though it's organic. I will never buy this product ever! I wasted around $5 with tax, but I got to warn you all about this tea. I guess it's worth it? now I wished I would have listen to the other reviewers, hopefully someone will take my words to consideration before purchasing.<br /><br />I saw one of the 1 star reviewer being questioned in comment section, and I don't really care if I get questioned because this tea does taste bad and I am mad about this purchase. Again, this IS my FIRST REVIEW, if you don't think it's reliable that's your own problem and you can go ahead and purchase this tea. Anyways, TAKE IT or LEAVE IT. This is what I observe, and this is my opinion and conclusion.

review/text: I guess that I'm spoiled for good tea, as we have a local tea/coffee merchant (the Spice Merchant!) that sells great loose leaf tea, but this stuff is awful. It has a bitter, dirty taste no matter what temperature of water you're using. I strongly recommend that you avoid this crap at all costs! I'd rather have no tea at all than drink this.

review/text: Not a very good tasting tea. Leaves an aftertaste in the mouth.<br /><br />Here are some of the instruction on the box:<br />"That 1 tea bag shall be used for each 6 oz. of royal water."<br />"That the royal water be brought to a boil & let cool no less than 5 but no more than 7 minutes."<br />"That the royal water be poured carefully over the royal tea bag."<br />"The royal steeping time be no less than 1 but no more than 2 minutes."<br /><br />Huh?!? What's with the "royal" nonsense? Is there a special water filter I need to purchase in order to have "royal" water? Perhaps that is why there is an aftertaste-I don't use or have access to "royal" water.<br /><br />It also says on the box:"Somewhere in Pa's mind, he harbors a long standing belief that he comes from nobility." Signed by "His Perilous princess, NELL."<br /><br />This stuff is pure nonsense-makes no sense to me at all. Maybe they need to spend more time on the tea than on someone who is dilusional?

review/text: My shipment does NOT contain the same product as was shipped in my last order of the 3.5 ounce jars! Its darker, bitter, more oily & hurts my stomach.  It was immediately noticeable upon opening the jar.  The aroma was not the same and you could see right away the crystals were dark brown... not the usual honey color.  Additionally, one of the jar lids was broken in shipment.  THE SELLER WAS TERRIFIC ABOUT THE RETURN - very nice... and I would buy from them again.  I ordered the small size jars f rom the same seller as I did a few months ago... same problem.  This product has changed.

review/summary: Great taste, gentle on the stomach
review/text: I love Nescafe Gold because it's a light roast, plus they extract the tannins from it in the processing so overall you get less bitterness and it doesn't irritate the stomach like regular coffee does. I have stomach problems and other coffees really irritate my stomach, including Nescafe Original. I have found that Gold doesn't bother my stomach at all when dissolved in a mugful of hot milk. I can even drink it without breakfast in the morning! So yeah, nice flavor and a very mild-tasting, stomach-friendly coffee, if that's what you want. Too bad it's hard to find in the US and you have to order and pay shipping... But it's all over Europe (where I grew up) and I miss it, so I order it through Amazon.<br /><br />P.S. The seller was very nice in sending me 2 jars for the price of 1 with a nice note, because it was around Christmastime :-)

review/summary: Yummy, Addictive and Healthy Snack
review/text: These may be the best pretzels I've ever had. They're tasty AND healthy (bonus: They're organic). Good alone or with salsa, guacamole or a non-fat dips. Or add some apple or pear slices, a dollop of yogurt or some fresh veggies for a quick and healthy at-home or on the go snack.<br /><br />I first came across them in a desperate attempt to wean myself from baked white cheddar chips. Looking for something crunchy yet non-fattening wasn't easy. You get 15 pretzel sticks at only 130 calories and no saturated or trans fats. Works for me!<br /><br />Best of all, there's 4% dietary fiber in a serving. (About 8 servings to an 8-ounce bags, so we're talking about a week's worth of healthy snacks.)<br /><br />The honey wheat flavor is great and best of all, it's a satisfying snack, too.<br /><br />If you buy in bulk, be sure to hide away those other bags and count out portions. Otherwise, it's way too easy to overeat these pretzels.

Every once in a while eating these you get a punch from the taste of sesame seeds which make these pretzel sticks that much better.

review/summary: Good pretzel, if slightly sweet.
review/text: The problem with most pretzels is that they are white-flour bombs.  Lots of carbohydrate and not much else (other than a ton of salt).  Consequently, I have been looking for a good whole-grain pretzel.  These are pretty good.  The multiple grains add a variety and depth of flavor not found in plain pretzels, and you sure don't miss the extra salt.  Although they have a crunch, they are not so hard that my wife won't eat them.  They have only three flaws.  First, they are slightly sweet.  Although it is a subtle sweetness (which I suppose some folks like), I could do without it.  Second, white flour remains the number one ingredient, notwithstanding the multiplicity of whole grains.  Third, although they are low fat, they are not fat-free.  I am not sure why the bakers find it necessary to add oil to a pretzel.  Despite these shortcomings, these are a good--and healthier--alternative to standard prtezels, and much, much healthier than most other salty snacks.

If you like pretzels want organic and are looking for a slightly salty/sweet taste, then this is one you will enjoy too!<br /> This is an edit of my review as my last shippment of this product was not very good... the pretzels in this latest shipment have an odd taste to them...sad as they were so good tasting in prior shipments...I also see that you can not get this organic Pretzel anymore as it show as unavailable, this maybe is due to the problem I am having, perhaps someone else found this odd taste that wasn't there before so<br />I'd change my rating on this product now after the problem w/ this shippment I hope they fix the problem.

review/text: Snyder did it all right. (you used to be able to get these in the big pretzel size in my grocery store, but they are no longer available where I live) The pumpernickel is delish, the onion is very faint, but distinguishible, and the salt is just enough to get you all excited, but not too much to overpower the pumpernickel. The sticks are a fun shape to munch, and if you have company that likes to dip things these are a good size for that (no double dipping). Sticks are about 3 inches long.

review/summary: BEST LOW CAL. PEANUT BUTTER ON THE PLANET!
review/text: Who ever the person is that said this stuff tastes like nail polish must have just swallowed a bottle of it then taken a bite of the peanut butter because there is not other reason that I can think of for them to make that assessment.<br /><br />This stuff is fabulous!  If your looking for chunky, this is not for you.  It has a nice sweet flavor, which makes it extra nice if your out of jelly or jam because it can work nicely on it's own.  :)  It's also very smooth and soft and extremely spreadable.  I have been very into PB&J lately and am just flying through my jars.<br /><br />I live by this stuff and recomend that everyone give it a try but PLEASE realize that it's okay if you don't love it.  You must remember that it's not your old school basic Jif.  It's low cal and just different, but that doesn't make it bad.  Oh, it's so good and I can't wait to have my PB&J tomorrow....maybe I'll have one for dinner, my mouth is watering for it right now.  :)

review/summary: Better'n WHAT peanut Butter?
review/text: So, I snagged a jar of this at my local Whole Foods, because it had been recommended to me as supplying full peanut butter satisfaction with a fraction of the fat and calories.  Well.  I didn't read the ingredient and nutritional info till I got home.  It has stuff in it like "Grain syrup".  What's that?  Tapioca syrup?  Vegetable glycerin, and dehydrated cane juice (more sugar).  So maybe it's because I've been eating sugar-free peanut butter for a while, but this stuff is REALLY sweet.  Like tooth-achingly, diabetic shock-inducing sweet.  It also has a nasty chemical undertaste, and a LOT of salt.  13 g carbs, 4 g protein, 2 g fat. 190 mg sodium. 100 calories.<br /><br />In the same conversation where so-called "Better'n Peanut Butter" was recommended to me, another person recommended PB2, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P4POZ8">Powdered Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 16 Oz</a>, which is a mixture of defatted peanut flour, sugar and salt.  Three ingredients, in that order.  Granted, it comes in powder form, so you have to reconstitute it, 2 TBSP peanut powder to 1 TBSP water.  Mix it up for a couple seconds, and it tastes like peanut butter.  No discernible sweetness or excessive salinity. No chemical undertaste.  5 g carbs, 5 g protein, 1.5g fat,94 mg sodium, 45 calories.  It's a wee bit more trouble cuz you have to mix it as needed.  But it's also delicious, unlike "Better'n Peanut Butter".  Oh, and available at Amazon at roughly the same price, considering that when a pound of PB2 is reconstituted with water, it makes about two pounds of tasty peanut butter.

review/summary: DELICIOUS
review/text: Oh my goodness. I went in to Trader Joes looking for PB2, but ended up coming out with this. I was really worried by some of the reviews saying it was either too sweet or too salty, as the added sugar in "reduced fat" peanut butters always leave me gagging. Turns out this stuff is AMAZING! I even like it better than my old peanut butter, because I can really taste the peanuts in this (don't worry, it's not overpowering). It reduces the calories of my daily sandwich by 45 calories, which is really cool too! The only reason this is 4 stars and not 5 is because of the price. Even off of Amazon, it's kinda pricey at about $4.00 for about 2 cups (AKA 16oz or lb) of peanut butter.

review/summary: Better'n no peanut butter at all!
review/text: For some, dietary fat is not about losing weight or whether one kind of fat is better than another. As far as MY body is concerned, fat is fat is fat is fat, whether it's solid vegetable shortening, wild salmon, or avocados. One level tablespoon of ordinary peanut butter contains between two-thirds and three-quarters of the fat I can safely eat in a day or I get very, very sick, so it's either go without entirely (waaah!) or try the alternative products. This is what my dietician recommends for very-low-fat diets; she had samples of a few different products and I preferred this. No, this isn't better tasting than real freshly-roasted peanuts ground with just a bit of salt and nothing else, which is my peanut butter baseline. I'll admit that right up front. Some reviewers have said it is very sweet but I don't agree; to my palate, it's much LESS sweet than the mainstream Jif/Skippy type. You do have to get used to the texture, which is a little "sandy" and very firm when refrigerated - stirring the living daylights out of it in the jar with the handle of a wooden spoon loosens it up and makes it more spreadable, although it will still tear up the puffy white bread like W*nder. It does "melt" really well onto hot toast (or pasta for peanut noodles, yum yum). I wouldn't eat it straight off a spoon the way some people do with regular peanut butter; OK but not great for "ants on a log" (celery with peanut butter and raisins) or spreading on apple slices (it tends to slide off), but for other PB uses - including the good ole PB&J - it's been a lifesaver.

For breakfast, I eat it on English muffins with a little strawberry jam and I put a tablespoon in my Weight Watchers chocolate smoothie. (Tastes like a chocolate/pb milkshake.)  I have not experimented with it for baking yet, but I plan to try that over the holidays.

review/text: I give it 3 stars cuz it's good to snack on.  Snacking the better'n peanut butter with veggies and bread is not bad at all if you're a peanut butter person.  This butter can be use in a good diet plan if you eat it sparingly.<br />Now, I DO NOT recommend this for protein shakes.  I lift weights and run 6 times a week and drink 3 protein shakes a day.  You cannot taste the better'n peanut butter in a blended shake.  I thought I could replace Skippy's reduced peanut butter, but I am back on it.

review/text: I read about this product and decided to try it.  I paid a visit to my local Whole Foods market & bought a jar for less than $6.  I was quite excited to find one of my favourite 'trigger' foods for half the calories, fat & sugar.  I started to buy 3 jars but thought I should try it first.  I rushed the jar home and tasted it on a spoon.  Nice peanut taste but it is VERY sweet!  Shocking considering the low grams of sugar.  I could never eat it with honey or jam.  I thought about cutting it with natural peanut butter but that would defeat the purpose of having a low calorie option.  I eat it spread on Wasa multi-grain Crisp Bread.  Very nice.  It relieves my peanut butter craving quite nicely.  I'll be buying the other 2 jars later this week!

It is good for this purpose b/c the warmth of the toasted muffin makes this spreadable.  It is not really spreadable enough to use for sandwiches.  I will buy again, but wouldn't buy in bulk.

review/summary: Way Better 'n Peanutbutter
review/text: I recently went on Weight Watchers and was missing peanut butter.  Then I picked some of this stuff up (at Trader Joe's) and was changed for life.  Its consistency is so good--creamier than peanut butter.  My friend with me said it tasted like the peanut butter in a Reese's.  I would never guess that one Tbsp is just one Weight Watcher's point.  It's sweet and creamy and hits the spot on a sandwich, apple slices, celery sticks, or my favorite:  a spoon.

Since it wouldn't work on sandwiches, I figured I'd use it in peanut butter cookies, but no. The dough was sticky and unmanageable; the cookies spread out into a chewy mess. Cannot recommend it.

review/text: I researched this for a long time before I actually bought it. I've bought natural peanut butter in the past and could never find one that tastes like the peanut butter that is bad for you but tastes so good. This is the closest I've found. At first I admit I wasn't impressed but it wasn't bad. After going through a jar of it, I'm addicted. I don't even like the bad for you peanut butter any more. This tastes so much better. The only drawback I have with it is that it's not easily spreadable and very sticky. For the taste and calorie content though, I will deal with that. :-D

review/summary: Great Substitute for the Real Thing
review/text: It's not often that low calorie, low fat substitutes are as enjoyable as the real thing.  This product hits the mark.  The peanut taste is there and so is the creamy mouth feel of peanut butter.  At just 100 calories for the two tablespoons serving, it's almost half of what you would eat when having your favorite brand.  Eating 85% less fat is great, too, and it's cholesterol free. It's even low sodium.  Since I'm a crunchy peanut butter lover, I sometimes add a few peanuts to my sandwich and enjoy Better 'n Peanut Butter just as much as if I were eating my formerly-favorite brand.  What's more, it's a guilt-free pleasure.<br /><br />I'm giving a jar to my son to make his sinfully delicious peanut butter pie.  I think the taste and texture will be as satisfying but, with far less fat and calories.  I definitely will re-order when the four jars are devoured--er, gone.

review/text: I am hooked on this product...thank G*d they have this at Trader Joe's for $3.99/jar (although it's only the low sodium regular flavor version).<br /><br />Although you have to refrigerate this (otherwise it gets moldy after a few weeks) and it's a little bit less "firm" than regular peanut butter at room temperature, this is the closest thing I've ever had to regular peanut butter that's low fat (2G vs.16G). The taste isn't perfect, but it's good enough to satisfy the peanut butter craving and not feel guilty about all the fat. And when you mix it with jelly, bananas or whatever, it's almost identical to the original.

review/summary: Great dog food and EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!
review/text: The Cesar Filet Mignon is a terrific dog food either by itself for small dogs or an extra added treat mixed in with food for the larger dog. My two Shih Tzus won't eat anything else and my two Silky Terriers loce it mixed in with their Pedigree Lean Liver and Beef. Cesar Filet Mignon is truly a GREAT dog food!!!

review/text: I tried this oatmeal. It was too "natural" for me.  I don't like the flax and found the flavor to be bland.  If I wanted my food to taste like that I would buy bulk horse feed from the feed store down the street.

review/summary: Check your boxes
review/text: I have been purchasing there products for 2-3 years now. Not always, but sometimes the box contains bugs inside the bones, that make my dog sick. After further examination it seems the bugs come inside hte box. Today I opened a new one only to find it full of bugs to, I threw them all away and probably wont purchase again. I dont urge you to stop buying the product but rather check it thoroughly before giving it to your dog. If it does contain bugs contact the company and tell them where you bought it.

review/summary: Medium Sized Treat, Big Yummy Taste
review/text: Milkbone Original Crunchy Treats / B000EBKSCU<br /><br />My puppy just loves these Milkbone treats. Though the box says "Great for Training", they are a bit too big for proper treat training (which involves slicing the treats very thinly so that the dog doesn't get satiated or fattened up) because the treats are very hard and cannot be easily sliced into smaller pieces.<br /><br />However, they are uniquely good for training "Leave It!" - I can drop it on the floor and the puppy immediately notices the smell and comes over to investigate. And if he decides to ignore my "Leave It!" command, the treat is big enough and hard enough that it survives in his mouth long enough for my to reach in and grab it and start over - no rewards for ignoring "Leave It!", or he'll ignore it always. After only a few weeks of training, "Leave It!" is well-understood and almost always obeyed, thanks to these yummy Milkbones.<br /><br />Also, since these are larger and more satisfying that his usual treats, he also gets these at crate time. When Mommy says "Crate!" that means he snuggles into his crate and waits anxiously for his Milkbone treats. He absolutely adores them, and loves gobbling them up happily.<br /><br />These came carefully packed from Amazon with no shipping problems. The bulk price on Amazon is much cheaper than anything I've found locally and much more convenient.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
