review/text: Great Stuff. Because I liked it so much, I've sent it to relatives. This seasoning can be used on almost any salad or main dish. Wish it were available in retail stores, but maybe there's a reason why it isn't. (Perhaps a spoilage or shelf life issue.) Hope it remains available at Amazon..

review/summary: Tasty when it works, but potential fire hazard
review/text: I bought these because I like the Movie Theater Butter flavored microwave popcorn.  I've bought the in the store and thought this was a great deal.<br /><br />But these have a serious problem.  The bags say to cook for no longer than 2.5 minutes (that's 2 minutes, 30 seconds) and to stop if, before that, the popping slows down to a pop ever 2 seconds.<br /><br />I cooked about 10 of the bags and half of them burned through before reaching the limit, all while not slowing down the popping. One bag burned right through at about the one minute mark, with about 30 kernels popped.  Butter-goo was all over the microwave. What a mess!<br /><br />I'm going to throw out the rest, because I'm terrified one will actually burst into flames.

review/text: This was a great price so we decided to give it a try. If I knew then what I know now, I would NOT have done so. The expiration date is April 2011, and I'm writing this review at the end of January. It will probably keep, but we fixed one bag and it already tastes stale..so I am going to contact Amazon and see what they say. When I buy in bulk, I expect the expiration date to be reasonable, and less than 3 months on this huge pack of popcorn is NOT reasonable. Would not recommend.

review/text: this has got to be the absolute WORST microwave popcorn I have EVER had.  Lots of unpopped kernels.  The "butter" was more like "seized" glop (warm, lumps of lard).  I threw out the first bag after eating a small handful.  I took the rest of the order to work for those who appreciate this type of thing.  It didn't disappear very quickly, so maybe I am not the only one that thinks Orville Redenbacher's is a HUGE WASTE of money.

review/summary: My Son will eat them!
review/text: My son has autism. He is on a gluten-free, casein-free, and soy free diet, so there is not a lot of pre-packaged stuff out there that he can eat that he actually wants to eat. We have tried the Glutino pretzels, they are good but have soy. My typical son on an unrestricted diet likes them and asks for them. But my gf/cf/sf son can't have them.<br /><br />I brought home a few sample bags of these from a TACA meeting (Talk About Curing Autism) and my son ate them right up. I was glad to see them on this site so I could order them in bulk.<br /><br />I tried them and didn't think they tasted bad. Of course, they could use more salt for my taste, but my son gets enough sodium from other sources, so I'm glad that they aren't salted.

review/summary: HIGH FIBER SNACK!!
review/text: I love these small, round 3/4" pretzels!  What sets them apart is that they have 3 gr of FIBER in every serving!  That equals my husband's Metamucil (registered trademark) dietary fiber!  Plus, they taste very good, it's hard to stop snacking...<br /><br />Don't look for alot of salt on the outside, but the overall flavor is salty enough for me. A serving has 230 mg, or 10% of your daily sodium intake.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts: each bag has 4 (30g) servings of 40 pretzels, each serving has 130 calories, 30 from fat, 3.5g total fat, 2g saturated fat (9%), No trans fat or cholesterol, 24g carbohydrate (8%), 3g dietary fiber, 1g sugar, .6g protein.<br /><br />I once bought a bag of the Ener-G GF 2.65 oz. pretzels,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFIIZO">Ener-G Foods Crisp Pretzels, Wheat-Free, 2.65-Ounce Bags (Pack of 20)</a> and they taste great - but each serving has twice the salt, almost twice as much fat (6g), and less than 1g fiber.  That is alot of salt for a snack.  (all the other values are about the same).  Put enough fat and salt in anything, and it will taste good...I choose the Wylde pretzels!<br /><br />PS:  Don't eat these unless you have sound teeth - I had a temporary, plastic crown break while eating them.

review/summary: Autism Spectrum Disorder
review/text: I have a daughter with Autistic Spectrum Disorder... DAN! (Defeat Autism Now!) had an article that implied some connection between gluten and dairy allergies to behavioral difficulties in children with this disorder. So, we decided to try a gluten-free, dairy-free diet to see what happened. I have to say I have seen a good deal of improvement in her general behavior as well as her focus and retention rate.<br /><br />From what I understand it is a good product for kidney patients as well because it is low protein. And it's Kosher Parve.<br /><br />I tried these pretzles because of this new diet and now my whole family is addicted! They are tasty, crunchy and not too salty, but still satisfy my desire for salty foods. We will be buying these from now on.

review/summary: Great gluten-free snack
review/text: I have endometriosis and was looking for snacks that would not aggravate my condition.  These pretzels are so delicious, I can eat them all day with no negative effects.  I will say that people either hate these or love these though.  The people who hate them seem to be males more than females and usually are people who do not have any alergies.  My best work friend (who is vegan) sneaks into my desk constantly for them.  The taste is like eating just the outside crunchy part of a regular pretzel.  They are very crunchy and well suited for travelling, stashing in your office desk, and snacking during surfing the web.  I reccomend these to people with food alergies that miss their wheat snack products and often get a craving for a salty snack.<br />Additionally, I find them to be a great value and they last a long time.  They are less suceptable to getting stale than regular snacks.  I ordered two boxes eight months ago and still have a few bags left.  When I open the new bags, they are just as fresh and tasty as the ones I opened eight months ago.  If you get tired of snacks and want to rotate variety, these pretzels will wait until you are ready to fit them back into your lunch pack.

review/summary: Many broken pieces during shipping?
review/text: I ordered a case & was dismayed that all the bags contained 70% broken pieces.  I bought these for my gluten-free, soy-free, egg-free son & for small children, broken food is a big deal.  I will pursue a refund from Amazon.<br /><br />Once you can get past the broken pieces, they taste good.

review/text: I was very happy with this product.  Even my husband, who doesn't need to eat gluten free, liked them.  Nice and crunchy with a very good taste.  I tried a smaller bag at the local store for 2 bucks and liked it.  Then, I saw these and it was a much better buy.  Compare prices though, because right now this size isn't the best deal.  It was when I bought it.

review/text: Another great produce carried by Amazon for those suffering from Celiac Disease or anybody else who wants a great tasting crunchy pretzel.  My husband was diagnosed with Celiac Disease 4 years ago.  It has been my goal to make him feel less restricted in a world that is chock full of gluten.  I read every food label of anything I purchase so it is nice to know that there is a wonderful worry-free snack food out there that tastes even better than regular pretzels.  Good thing you can get this product in 4 oz bags or you would not be able to pace yourself. Thanks again Amazon for making such a wonderful produce as Wylde Pretzels available and accessible to all.

Some bags give the impression of having less salt than others but the crunch is always right on. Even if I didn't have to eat gluten-free these would be my top choice for snack food. They are great in chili or soups as a substitute for crackers too. I am so glad to be able to buy an entire case!

I compared all the sizes of the bags and prices on Amazon.<br /><br />If your child has food problems, buy a bag from the local health food store, try them out and then come back to Amazon and buy a case or two.  Definitely the best deal.

review/text: This is an awesome snack.  I haven't had regular pretezels in 4 years so I'm going by an old memory, but these taste similar to what I remember pretezels were like.  The shape is an "0" instead of a traditional pretzel shape.  I like that the serving size is 40 of them; I can eat a lot of them without feeling guilty about it.

review/text: Well, it is all about personal taste, and I love these!  If you have to be<br /><br />gluten free these pretzels make a great snack.  I haven't actually tasted a regular pretzel in over 20 years, and I never really liked them anyway.  But these are perfect.  Small, not too salty, and fresh, I think they are a super snack food.  I buy them by the case and so does my father, sister-in-law, and brother.  All have a gluten intolerance and think that these are the best since sliced bread!

review/summary: There are other and BETTER gluten-free pretzels out there...
review/text: We have been a gluten free family for many years and have been enjoying the new products that are now continully being introduced.  These pretzels are not nearly as good as the ones by Ener-G Foods (small size bags) or by Glutano (larger, family size bags).  These Wylde pretzels are, as one reviewer already commented, not salty enough - that is, not salty enough for me to feel they qualify as satisfying a pretzel yearning.  These pretzels are also much harder than the others, which I don't find appealing.  That being said, I would highly recommend the Glutano or the Ener-G Foods pretzels over these.  I rated it 2-stars simply for being another gluten free product.

review/summary: You bet your bum it works!
review/text: A few weeks ago, I met a nice gentleman at a bar.  You know the story - girl meets boy, boy buys girl a drink, girl blacks out, girl wakes up with a rash. But this wasn't your ordinary rash. It was itchy, but not that itchy. It was red, but I couldn't tell how red because of the location of the rash. I was embarassed to go to the doctor for fear that I'd have to explain that I spent the night with one of Ricky Martin's backup dancers. Instead, I looked to my local grocer for a home-made solution.  I tried Neosporin, soap and water, Tuscan Whole Milk baths, deep tissue massages, all with minimal improvement to my stubborn rash.<br /><br />Just when I was about to accept the fact that I'd be wearing crotch-less pants for the rest of my life, I saw an episode of "I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant" where one of the reenactments showed a woman using applying organic diaper ointment to her rash. I immediately zipped up my pants and ran to the store. I can't even begin to explain how relieved I am to be rash-free!<br /><br />I've heard this product works well on babies too. 5 stars!

review/text: I'm always looking for better, more natural products. I usually use Aveeno's diaper cream, but I decided to give this cream a try because it's organic and has all natural ingredients. It has a nice consistency and is easy to spread. You can see the skin through it and tell if it looks better or worse. Unfortunately it caused a rash on my daughter's bottom. I tried it several times to be sure that it was this cream that was causing the rash, and it is. I'm going back to Aveeno.

review/summary: Love Love Love this diaper ointment
review/text: I bought this ointment at a friends recommendation a year ago because my son had broken out with a case of eczema (he was then 4 months old).  I started applying it not only as a diaper rash remedy but to his patches of eczema and it really helped.  My son's eczema cleared up as soon as I realized that the shampoo I used was causing the problems but I still use this ointment as a diaper cream.  He has never had a bad diaper rash, but the moment I see pink on his bottom I apply this cream and the pink is gone by the morning.  We have had a pretty brutal summer heat wise and I broke out in a heat rash on my legs (first time ever).  Exhausted from trying everything else that didn't work, I applied this cream to it and the rash went away within a day.  It has helped both my son and I.  I will always have a tube of this in my house.

review/text: Our baby is a month old, and I haven't been putting anything on her bottom because she's been just fine.  A few days ago, one of her creases looked red and irritated, so I pulled out a tube of this stuff to apply some.  Then I noticed that it is supposed to be used as a preventative.  Oops.<br /><br />But, the next day, the red irritation was totally gone.  So, I don't know whether that counts as prevention or cure, but it obviously helped her.<br /><br />This seems like good stuff.<br /><br />Also: another reviewer mentioned that the cream is gritty.  Maybe that is why that reviewer's cream was on clearance at the store to begin with?  I bought this on Amazon a couple months ago, and ours is not gritty at all.

review/summary: Amazing Diaper Ointment!
review/text: When my son was a newborn, his tushie skin was super sensitive.  He immediately developed a rash at the hospital, the nurses kept on using A+D, and due to circumstances beyond my control, I could not correct this mistake until a couple of days into this situation.  The rash was very bad at that point, and none of the hospital's ointments were working.<br /><br />I immediately started putting on Nature's Baby Organics ointment (which was a cream at the time), and his rash started to improve rapidly!!!  I was so happy that my newborn was finally getting some relief, and so impressed with this brand!  It cleared up my newborn's heartbreakingly bad rash in a matter of days.<br /><br />I have been using Nature's Baby Organics ever since, and I loved it even more when they upgraded their product to an ointment vs. the cream!!!  It performs even better, and I could not be happier!  I have been recommending this product to all of my friends, and I will continue to use it with my second baby.

review/summary: product may have separated...
review/text: I got this lotion from Buy Buy Baby because I found it on sale recently.  I will mention that I have also bought Nature's Baby Organics products on Amazon and this has been the only product that gave me issues.  When I started using it, the product came out clumpy with small gritty pieces, almost like large sand granules.  Maybe because it is a more natural product it tends to separate after a while.  If you rub the grit pieces between your fingers enough, they break down.  I have put this on my baby thinking that the heat from his body would break down the clumps but this was not the case.  I've notice the grit is still there when I change him again.  The grit that formed is not soft.  I think it is crystallized material but like I said, if you rub it between your fingers enough, it will break down.  I wanted to let people know about this product issue because it is an expensive cream.  I feel that I spent a lot of money on a product that turned out to be unusable.

review/summary: Our dogs love them!!!
review/text: We have two small Maltese and they absolutely love these treats. We often break them in half to make the box last a little longer. As far as helping their breath, they help a bit. When it comes to their dental needs their is no substitution for manually brushing their teeth.

review/summary: Package wasn't received, and both UPS and Amazon said it was the other's problem
review/text: I have given my dogs these dental treats before and they are very popular with them. The package I found on Amazon was a good price for the large quantity ordered. Since now I have paid the money and never received the item, and basically have found no direct route of getting refunded, I am not happy. I will be reluctant to purchase from Amazon again because there was no way for me to get hold of them for a reimbursement. I contacted UPS and they said Amazon likes to handle these things directly. And from looking all through Amazon's website, it says to contact UPS directly. And when I try to put in for a refund, the product not arriving is never an option---and there is no phone number or way to email otherwise. I guess I am out $30 for this purchase. I am disappointed in both Amazon and UPS for their service. I think if the product arrived, I would have likely been happy with it.

review/text: This is the most accessible of the Islay single malts. If you have an affinity for peat in your whisky, then Lagavulin 16 is a fine choice. Go for the 12 YO for a more bold, higher ABV, but equally rewarding experience.  Wonderful balance of sweet peat, sherry, vanilla, BBQ'd bacon, dark fruits...exceptional single malt.  A great deal if you can find it &lt;$60. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Real Banana Flavor With Lots of Chopped Nuts
review/text: An excellent muffin mix with real banana flavor and lots of chopped nuts.  To me, these muffins taste every bit as good as commercial banana bread purchased from coffeehouses like Starbucks and Peet's.<br /><br />When I used baking cups, one package of mix produced 24 mini-muffins plus 2 standard muffins.  The muffins took a couple more minutes than the package directions called for when I used the convection oven option for my electric range.  When I don't use baking cups, one package produces 24 mini-muffins.  My muffin pans are the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IMZ7R6">Dr. Oekter Nonstick Mini-Muffin Pan</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RHI9Q">Good Cook Nonstick 12-Cup Muffin Pan</a>.<br /><br />The Krusteaz Banana Nut muffins have much more flavor than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LLM81C">Krusteaz Oat Bran Muffins</a>, although both mixes produce muffins with very good texture.  Maybe it's the three eggs that make the Banana Nut muffins taste so good!  I purchased both Krusteaz mixes (in single-batch boxes) at my local grocery store.

review/summary: fast and easy to make and even tastes pretty good
review/text: I used to buy these at a local retailer but sadly although they still carry the brand, they stop getting the banana nut flavor and kept getting lemon bars and pecan something flavors.<br />I bought some other brands available and they didn't taste good at all and texture wasn't ideal either.<br /><br />I am glad amazon has Krusteaz Banana Nut flavor muffins.<br />They are moist but not to soggy, and fluffy enough and not dry.<br />All you need to add is 1/2 cup of water, 1/3 cup of oil, and 3 eggs.<br />I usually cook it in the cupcake pan with cupcake paper and instead of 400 degrees F like the box says, I put it in 375 for 17 minutes and it comes out just perfect.<br /><br />I am too busy and tired to bake banana nut muffins/bread from scratch so this mix is convenient and tastes great.

review/summary: Good taste, bachelor easy.
review/text: As a guy, I don't do much baking. Although, after reading the directions on the box, I figured it'd be tough to mess this recipe up.<br /><br />I chose the mini-muffin route. For the muffin tins I was using, this box of mix yielded about 30 muffins. I also included about � of a banana, finely chopped, in my batch (I always feel so short changed when I buy a banana/apple/etc. muffin and it turns out to just be fruit "flavored" with no actual bits of fruit in it). The estimated cooking times on the box seemed spot on. In my 400� oven (thermometer verified), the ideal time was about ten minutes per twenty-four mini's.<br /><br />I'm surprised the instructions don't recommend adding fruit as an option, because these things came out great! Not only that, but they were quite easy to make. It couldn't have taken me more than thirty-five minutes from prep to clean up.<br /><br />I'm deducting one star for the banana flavoring (dried bananas, according to the ingredients panel). I can't really blame Krusteaz for this because all commercially processed bananas/banana flavorings always seem to taste like they're way beyond ripe. I'm one of those people who likes bananas that are fresh or still a little green.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I'll definitely be buying Krusteaz again.

review/text: I'm so sad the previous reviewer felt so poorly about this mix. I think it's FANTASTIC! I went to a different grocery store that didn't carry this brand and I just bought whatever was there. Did not even begin to compare.  I made a batch for my Sunday School class and people went bazonkers over them. One man even pulled my hubby aside and asked if we had anymore at home!!!<br /><br />Now, I'll be honest I didn't make them "straight up". I used one of the suggestions on the side of the box and added chocolate chips A-MAZING!!! Right now, I've got one giant muffin and big ol' glass of milk right beside me and I am one happy camper.

review/summary: This brand has a great reputation but....
review/text: I was very disappointed with this Krusteaz Banana Nut Muffin Mix.  I've used this brand many times and have never been disappointed before but this muffin mix is HEAVY and almost tasteless.  The banana and walnut flavors should stand out but they don't with this mix.  Don't get me wrong.....there is nothing wrong with it but it just does not bake and taste like other Krusteaz mixes that I've tried so my anticipation has tainted my view of this product.  I suggest you try a box from the local stores before actually buying a case from Amazon.  You may love it or, like me, don't find that it bakes into a very good muffin.

review/text: To say these snacks are incredible might be overblown, but they're not far from it.  The kids grab these things so fast, you don't even know that you've bought them - they're gone as fast as them come in the door.  This variety pack is particularly nice, especially if you're buying them for sportsteam snacks.  The kids just LOVE them and mom and dad eat them too! If you're afraid to try them because of the nasty things we had in the 70s, you know, those things that PRETENDED to be fruit snacks? These are NOTHING like that at all! Great stuff!

review/text: My wife brought  a couple variety packs of Fruit Gushers for the last Halloween give-away. Unfortunately, we had a few packs left over so we've been consuming them from time to time. My wife likes to give them to our toddler as a little reward. He loves them, of course. Actually, they are rather good. They're a candy that looks like a small irregular blob. It's soft to the touch and tastes fruity. The trick is that when you bite down the soft blob crushes and releases a sweet and fruity flavored syrup into the mouth. They're quite flavorful and enjoyable to eat. My main worry would be that the candy itself is quite sticky and hard to get off the teeth, so brush carefully after indulging.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: This is a good product.  It so extremely thick, it is not spreadable like peanut butter.  But personally I like that, because it means it has less added oils and is almost pure cashews so I'm getting my money's worth.  I've made my own cashew butter before in a blender with organic cashews, canola oil and a touch of salt and it was extremely good and I am likely to make my own again.  But this is a wonderful ready-made.  So extremely cashewy and the right amount of salt and sweetness from the honey.  I love it and am ordering more.

review/summary: Maltodexrin
review/text: Agree with the other reviewer. This product claims to be safe for diabetics, yet the first ingredient listed is maltodextrin, not stevia! I am a diabetic, and maltodextrin spikes my blood sugar just as much as table sugar does. It should not be legal for sugar substitutes to use this ingredient, and say "safe for diabetics" on the label, when it is not!  I was so upset that I had this product and had been using it before realizing that it had maltodextrin in it. It had not even occured to me that I needed to check the ingredients on a package that said it is STEVIA. I'd understand if it said it is a stevia blend like some others, but this is marketed as a natural, diabetic friendly product and it isn't.<br /><br />There are a lot "sugar free" products out there that also contain maltodextrin. I was not expecting to find it in what I thought was a natural sweetener.

So by cutting stevia with maltodextrine, In The Raw has negating anything positive about this product, and made it JUST AS BAD FOR YOU, if not worse than, table sugar.  Total waste of money, if only I had read the label when I was still in the store.

Stevia in the Raw is much easier to use than those little packets of other brands....it dissolves better and you can use it just like sugar, in baking, coffee, tea, on your cereal, etc. It can be conveniently measured cup for cup in baking. It may seem expensive, but when you realize the ease of use and how far a bag of it goes, you will be satisfied.
