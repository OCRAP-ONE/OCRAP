review/text: I would eat this granola even if I wasn't following a gluten-free diet. You can't tell that the oats are gluten free and the taste and texture are just like other non-gluten-free granola. Tastes great sprinkled on top of yogurt, etc. I wouldn't consider it a cereal though, the bag would only be a bowl or two.

review/summary: The softest, puffcorn snack from Frito-Lay. So Delicious!
review/text: So Delicious! This product is a spin-off of Cheeto's and utilizes the mascot, Chester Cheetah.<br /> This puffcorn snack is really soft on your teeth while you watch your favorite movie on television. No hulls,  No kernals. Nothing burnt. No butter. No Peanuts, No cholesterol.  No Trans Fat. Nice cheesy taste.<br /> As of this writing, in the store, it might cost you $2.00 for a single bag 4.5 oz, but you will eat these corn meal puffs so quickly during your movie, you are going to want more. They are addicting.<br />  From Amazon, you can buy 12 bags (4.5 oz.) in one shipment.<br />  Use your Amazon.com gift e-card balance for this one.

review/text: I love this product as it is a soft, melt in your mouth variant of popcorn that poses no threat to the teeth for those of us 'past a certain age'. (i.e. no threats of teeth chipping kernels, etc). I would love to have the convenience of purchasing it via Amazon, but not for this inflated price. The shipping charge I understand, but not $5 over the price on the bag.

review/summary: Not as good as the other MoJo bars
review/text: So I really love the mojo bars, they really hit the spot when you are not in the mood to make a lunch or need something light in the tummy.  I haven't tried them all but the ones that I have tried have been amazing.  I really love the trail mix, chocolate coconut almond, peanut butter pretzel, and the smores. My favorite being the peanut butter pretzel and I add chocolate chips with every bite lol  I wanted to like this one because I have had such success so far with the other mojo bars but this one was not a winner in my book.  I mean it is nutritious but really lacks in any sort of flavor.  It is niether sweet or salty and is just kind of bland.  The nuts dont even really give it much taste but do add a nice crunch.  You are getting protien and good fats but you can get that with other more flavorful bars.  If you are the type that likes something very simple with no flavor then this is ok, but try the other mojo bars that I recomended so you wont be turned off by sampling this one first.<br /><br />200 calories<br />12 grams of fat<br />8 grams of sugar<br />3 grams of fiber<br />8 grams of protien<br />190 mg of sodium<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Soy Rice Crisps (Soy Protein Isolate, Organic Rice Flour, Calcium Carbonate), Almonds, Organic Cashews, Organic Pecans, Organic Pretzels (Organic Wheat Flour, Salt, Organic Canola Oil, Organic Malt), Organic Macadamia Nut Butter, Organic Oat Syrup Solids, Hazelnuts, Vegetable Glycerin, Sea Salt, Organic Gum Arabic, Organic Sunflower Oil, Natural Vitamin E (antioxidant).

review/summary: Watermelon Candy...mmmmm
review/text: Bought a bag of this brand of Taffy about 6 weeks ago.  Had all varieties of this particular taffy in it including the watermelon taffy.  Just loved the watermelon taffy so much, came to Amazon.com to see if it was available all by itself.<br />Now that I've had the candy for a couple of weeks almost, I must say the thrill is gone.  Not as excited about eating this candy.  For some reason still manage to pop a couple of pieces in my mouth daily, just can't resist it.  :)<br />This candy has a strong candy/watermelon smell to it, will have you licking your chips as soon as you unravel the wrapper.  Chew slowly, it's soooo good!!

We have purchased this very same product in a very nice upscale grocery, where they sell many imported food products.  It was so nice to just be able to sit at my computer, easily find this specialty pasta, and receive it on our doorstep in just a few days.  In fact we were able to send a few packages home with our visiting children.  And it was so well packaged, every bag of pasta was filled with unbroken fusilli.  What a treat! I will not hesitate to order more in the future!

review/text: This type of spaghetti pasta is my family's favorite. However in the area where I live, it is not available in any of the local super markets. Thus, I started an internet search and found Amazon selling Anna's at a very good price that included shipping. Trusting Amazon and being a frequent Amazon customer, I purchased a case. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. As for the pasta itself, it is from Italy, is delicious, and  cooks up quickly. I highly recommend this item.

review/summary: Great Fusilli
review/text: Long fusilli is hard to find in commercial grocery stores where I live, and the specialty Italian imports are 3x the price.  This was a great find as my husband loves the dense "toothy" feel of fusilli.  This is definitely dense, so if you're used to spaghetti, then this will probably be very chewy to you.  We eat "macaroni" every Sunday, so getting 12lbs at a time is great.

review/text: The first shipment of two bottles didn't make it. The only thing that made its way to me was the packaging. When I saw that empty envelope without my Jerk Seasoning enclosed, needless to say I was confused, then crushed when I realized someone at the post office probably sliced open the package and absconded with my Jerk Seasoning!! What is the world coming to?? Anyway, I shouldn't be telling anyone this because I should be keeping this a secret only for me, but this jerk seasoning is all that!!! I contacted the seller and explained what happened. They responded promptly and sent out another shipment. The second shipment arrived with the seasonings safely packaged. I am now able to continue to Jerk season pretty much everything, fish, chicken, pork, and shrimp. I would definitely purchase Jerk Seasoning from Koko's again, really soon at the rate I'm using it.

review/text: We first bought this seasoning based on a recommendation from a Jamaican restaurant we visited.  It did not disappoint.  It adds flavor to virtually any meat without too much heat, but is especially good on pork and chicken.  I use it on meats that I then put on a smoker, and the combination of the smoke flavor and seasoning is just perfect.

review/text: Put this on some Ribs. Turned out good. Use it somewhere between sparingly to moderate. It will quickly over power anything with the heat. That is unless you like really spicy food. The holes are a bit small but i think thats good in a way since the bigger hole would release too much of the hot peppers which are bigger in size. If used in the right amount it will a a nice kick without been to spicy.

review/summary: Tasty, nice texture
review/text: Even though these are reduced sugar, they still are very tasty and sweet. There are three varieties in the pack. The peanut butter version is my favorite in the assortment, but the chocolate chip and cookies & cream versions are also quite tasty.<br /><br />I like that the texture is a little firmer than the regular Quaker bars. Still soft and chewy, but the bar holds together better. It's also less sticky than other bars I've tried (although it still is sticky to the touch).<br /><br />While the nutritional content is certainly far from perfect, it's a much better snack than a candy bar, especially with regard to calories (100 to 120 per bar depending on the variety). Definitely worth a look if you want a lower cal but still tasty snack bar.

review/summary: Zesty spearmint and lemon are modulated by green tea into a substantial potion!
review/text: Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor.  The aroma is sweet spearmint.  The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it.  Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon.  The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion.  Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box.  A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee.  Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter.  Four minutes is ample.

review/summary: Another excellent low-carb bread
review/text: This bread is excellent. This bread is different and less dense than their other breads.  It is closer to the texture of traditional bread.  But it is still an excellent bread.  I have not tasted a bread made by Health Express that I have not liked.  I would eat this bread even if it weren't for the low-carb factor. I prefer it to regular bread and it's a lot healthier, even if you don't need a low-carb bread.

review/summary: Too dry
review/text: This is my first try at low carb bread.  I'd like to make low carb a way of life and can't imagine never having bread again.  I tried this because reviews said it was not as heavy as other breads in this category.  This tastes dry, dry, dry.  Bland.  Don't think I can make it through the loaf.  May try it for french toast.

review/summary: My favorite low carb bread
review/text: I have tried several low carb breads in my search.  This has proven to be the best one so far.  It has a regular bread texture and works just great for sandwiches. It is so nice and tender. I just toasted a piece and it was good toasted also.  This is the low carb bread for me.  My husband is not on a low carb diet and he thought his sandwich this noon was very good on this bread.  I think the texture is perfect.  Some of them are too course for sandwiches.

review/summary: Filling, easy, savory meal for 5
review/text: This is an easy-to-make dish that takes macaroni and cheese to the next level.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />- Easy prep.  Everything cooks in one pan.  No need to cook noodles separately.  Took 5 minutes to prep and 15 minutes to wait while it simmered.<br />- Makes a lot of food.  Our family of three was stuffed and we still had a lot left over.  This really does make 5 servings.<br />- Flavor is good. This is a comfort food.  The addition of lean ground beef really adds to the flavor.<br />- Nutrition is good if you use extra lean ground beef (except sodium.. see below).<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- A little high in sodium (38% RDA / 850mg / serving).  This is very common for these sorts of meals.<br /><br />Other thoughts:  If you use 90% lean ground beef, you get 9g fat per serving, which isn't too bad.  We used 95% so had more like 5g fat per serving (estimate).

review/summary: Heavy Duty Food for a Heavy Duty Appetite.
review/text: Summary:  Prepared as directed it's very satisfying but fattier than I'd like.<br /><br />It's super-deluxe cheesy-beefy-mac!<br /><br />This type of meal is fattier than I usually eat but I prepared it as directed (adding a full pound of beef) to present a fair review.  Tastes really good.  The seasoning adds something that you wouldn't get just by adding hambuger to mac&cheese.  And this is really good mac&cheese as well.  Delivers a satisfying feeling of satiation without eating a large portion.  Real comfort food.<br /><br />Preperation is a snap.  After simmering 13 minutes it looked like there was too much water left over but by the time the food was served it had congealed enough not to be runny.<br /><br />If I were to try this again I'd use ground turkey instead of beef and less of it.  Maybe 12 oz instead of 16 and add a bit more mac to make up for it.  But if you want a satisfying, beefy meal you can't go wrong these Cheeseburger Skillets.<br /><br />Box says fat is 9g a serving, 3g of it saturated.  That would vary depending on what type of meat you added.  Sodium is 850g.  Highish but not unusual for this tupe of prepared meal.  Unlike the the fat, it won't be easy to lower the sodium by fiddling with the recipe.<br /><br />Box suggested topping the finished dish with lettuce and tomato and that worked VERY WELL.

review/summary: Not Bad.....
review/text: As a confirmed Hamburger Helper junkie, I was very curious to see if Velveeta had the goods to dethrone "The Helping Hand" as my comfort food of choice. First off, I'll say this: The ULTIMATE CHEESEBURGER SKILLETS DINNER does, indeed, taste remarkably like a real cheeseburger. Going beyond just offering cheese-covered noodles and ground beef, there are hints of ketchup and mustard and onions, among other tantalizing tastes. My Wife, who is not a big fan of Hamburger Helper, stopped after a few bites- The mustard taste was too much for her. My eight year-old Daughter, not a huge fan of meat of any kind, loved it. For my part, I ate my first helping with gusto, but by the time seconds rolled around, the spice mixture was getting to be overpowering and a bit sickening. I scrapped the noodles and ate the rest of the ground beef. It wasn't bad, but the spice mix wasn't something that made me want to keep eating it. I'll happily try other Velveeta Hamburger Helper knock-offs, but this one didn't quite hit the spot the way I'd hoped.

review/summary: DELICIOSO!
review/text: This cheesy skillet dinner kit is very, very tasty.  Meant to be served with ground beef, if you happen to be a vegetarian, it can stand on its own as a main course.<br /><br />The macaroni is high quality (made with enriched wheat flour), tender and plump.  The seasoning has a tang of onions, cheese and tomato - a mild Southwestern flavor, I would say.  And when it's all done cooking, the Velveeta creamy cheese sauce then gets added.  It comes in a nice large pouch, is rich and thick and really finishes this dish off in good style.<br /><br />Other ingredients (less than 2%) include mustard seed, garlic and "natural flavors."  I wonder what these natural flavors specifically are.  Whatever they are, they certainly are tasty.<br /><br />The box contents make about five one-cup servings.  So I had leftovers for another meal.  It says you can customize it by adding chopped tomatoes and shredded lettuce.  I suppose that would enhance it, but they are not necessary.<br /><br />Calory-wise, listed are 220 calories as packaged, 350 as prepared.  Total fat is 9g.  Sodium 850 mg.  There are some vitamins too:  15% calcium, 6% iron, 2% vitamin A and 8g protein.<br /><br />So I'm really impressed and enjoyed this meal.  I would definitely purchase it in future.

review/summary: A Bit Salty
review/text: We had the Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillet Dinner Kit this evening. The directions are easy to follow and would be a great dish to make with a child. I cooked it a little more than on the recipe and it was still a bit soupy. While it was tasty (like a cheese burger) it was very, very salty. I had added a tiny bit of salt to the ground beef but not enough to make the whole dish salty. The box makes more than enough for two adults when you add a fruit and vegetable to the total dinner and still leaves a lunch portion left over. If you are dieting this is not the dish for you. A serving size is 2.5 oz which they say is about a cup and that is 350 calories and 9 grams of fat. On the other hand there is 8 grams of protein in that serving.<br /><br />The clean-up after dinner was a bit difficult. The cheese is really sticky and preparing the dishes for the dishwasher took a lot longer than usual. I am still waiting to see how the silverware fares. I had to hand wash the fry pan because I knew the dishwasher would not get all the cheese off, although I rinsed it in hot water several minutes before deciding to hand wash it.

review/summary: not as good as expected
review/text: My husband loves Hamburger Helper, and he also loves the Velveeta Shells and Cheese.  This product seemed a natural fit for his tastes.  So I was surprised that he was disappointed.<br /><br />The directions are almost identical to HH products - very quick and easy to make with either a pound of ground sausage or ground beef.  The prices are also comparable between the two products; each running less than $3 a box.  The cheesy skillet includes a foil packet of Velveeta to add at the end of preparation (just like the foil packet in the shells and cheese). It makes a good amount for 2 people for a dinner.  My husband usually gets a dinner and a lunch for the following day with HH and we did the same here.  Only unlike HH, the skillet does NOT reheat well.  The cheese sauce separated somewhat, despite thorough mixing.  The cheesy skillet is best eaten when it's freshly made.  On a picky note, the skillet also has much larger elbow noodles than the HH cheeseburger.  We preferred the smaller noodles.  I also noticed that the cheesey skillet has significantly more fat and calories as prepared than HH does.<br /><br />Overall, though it wasn't bad, we'll stick with the Hamburger Helper brand.

review/summary: Tasty - includes spices ...
review/text: I fixed this today with Morningstar Crumbles for a meatless dish along with asiago artisan bread and fresh corn.<br /><br />The Cheeseburger Skillets dinner is a traditional one-dish meal, and actually works well for casual dining, especially for kids. It was easy to fix and had a nice balance of flavor including the spices that are a part of this meal (and that dress it up from simple mac and cheese with ground beef). Since everything cooked in one pot, clean-up was easy. (I use t-fal and had no problem with anything sticking).<br /><br />Adding the bread and corn upgraded the meal, but it still fell under casual dining.<br /><br />As an individual allergic to sulfites, I was grateful that this particular dinner was sulfite-free.

I would give it 5 stars for taste and 3 stars for nutritional value -- so my rating average comes out to 4.

review/summary: Too cheesy
review/text: I know Macaroni and Cheese is supposed to be cheesy, but somewhere along the line this product became a bit too rich. The liquid cheese mix alone isn't bad, but the seasoning or spices included in the package were too much. If you put them both in the macaroni, they don't mix well. In fact, I ended up eating the macaroni with orange "spice" powder on the pasta. The taste isn't horrible, but it's not as good as the Kraft Macaroni and Cheese I'm used to. Oh, by the way, this set does not include cheeseburger - it's just the Mac & Cheese.

review/summary: Yellow Ain't My Color
review/text: I remember the glory days of Hamburger Helper and all the rest from the 70's.  As children we all thought it was some of the greatest stuff on earth- HH and some Rice-a-Roni made me a happy camper.  So in the spirit of that nostalgia I picked up the Velveeta Cheesburger Skillet Dinner... and discovered some things are best left in the past.<br /><br />Inside the box you get a small bag of elbow macaroni, a packet of cheese sauce and an envelope of 'seasoning'.  Brown up a pound of ground beef, add 2 cups of water and bring to a boil, add macaroni- you know the drill.  Time to add the 'seasoning'... which turned out to be 100% Genuine Artificial Cheese Flavoring.  Wouldn't be surprised if it was made with HFCS.  Dumping it into the pot raised a cloud that made me sneeze. Once the macaroni cooks it's time to add the Cheese Sauce- after all, you can't have a cheeseburger skillet dinner without submerging everything in... CHEESE.<br /><br />All of this turned the entire contents of the skillet into a decidedly unappetizing sickly yellow color.  The box photo does not do it justice.<br /><br />It did give me a few moments of nostalgia as I said before.  Growing up poor we had a lot of these quick & easy no-frills meals, and one bite made me want to watch an episode of Good Times.  This is the stuff that gets bulk ordered for food pantries, soup kitchens and military mess halls.  Best suited for when you're on the couch watching corny movies or sports highlights.  Definitely not for the squeamish or health conscious.

review/summary: Not awful, but nothing special either; file this under "Glorified Hamburger Helper."
review/text: The Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillets dinner kit strikes me as a slightly upgraded Hamburger Helper, only in this case, you get the Velveeta cheese pouch. It's basically a quick, easy, one-dish meal. You brown the beef, add the water, spices and cheese pouch and then simmer until it's done. All-in-all, it's not bad (kind of tastes like a cheeseburger...go figure) and makes a convenient, quick meal. That said, it wasn't notably better than similar Hamburger Helper dishes, which I generally add real cheese to (better than the Velveeta pouch in my humble opinion), despite the fact that it's more expensive. Also, with most pasta dishes, it's very often better after cooling-down and reheating. That's not the case here as the cheese sauce seems to separate a bit, so the reheated product is a bit of a mess (and less appetizing than the first go-round). It's best to finish this off when first made. This isn't a bad product, and I would eat it again, it's just nothing out-of-the ordinary.

review/text: Velveeta Cheesburger Skillets is not a product I'd generally buy. Mac and cheese is easy enough to make from scratch, using ingredients with no added chemicals/flavorings/preservatives. Considering that this is not the case with Velveeta, this particular processed dinner was good, very quick to prepare and flavorful. I can't say that it tastes like cheeseburgers, though, and it's high in salt and fat.

review/summary: Eh. It's okay.
review/text: I'll make this easy:<br /><br />This is a Kraft/Velveeta version of Hamburger Helper. The twist is that this has both a dry seasoning/cheese packet, and a gooey packet of Velveeta cheese product. The latter makes this a bit more cheesy than the Betty Crocker alternatives.<br /><br />Taste-wise, it's okay. I didn't hate it, but I can't see myself craving it, either. The cheese sauce totally overpowered the ground beef's flavor, and the dry packet added a little spicy kick. In the end, I think I could have used tofu or some other nearly-flavorless filler instead of beef, and I'd have been just as happy with the end result.<br /><br />The noodles are big and decent quality. Cooking time is acceptable. The only problem I see is the price; It averages out to about two-fifty per box in US dollars. This is obviously competing with Hamburger Helper, and I can get a box of `Helper for a little over a buck, or less if I get the store brand instead of the Betty Crocker variety. I fail to see how this is worth more than the competition. The cheese sauce packet doesn't make enough of a difference (It's just Velveeta, not real cheese, and I could buy a huge brick of Velveeta and add it to the competition's mix, and still spend less money).<br /><br />If you find it on sale, I'd say go for it. It's good. I just don't think it's "two dollars and fifty cents per box" good. I'd pay half that for it. I think Kraft is dreaming when they price a box of noodles, powder, and Velveeta at double what the competition is asking for essentially the same thing.<br /><br />Still, maybe it will make you feel special spending more. That's up to you. The quality is decent. The taste is fine. It's worth a shot if you don't mind the price.

review/summary: About what I expected
review/text: When I saw that this product was in the "helper" category, I did not really get excited.  These types of meals are designed for speed and ease of cooking, not really for their top tier flavors.  I chose this product due to the Velveeta branding and thinking that this would make for a great Mac and Cheese dish.  After following the directions for preparation, I found the product to look exactly like any other "helper" product I have tried before.  Upon tasting it, I did not feel that it differentiated itself from its competitors and that the seasoning provided in the package was too salty (Nutrition: over 25% Saturated Fat - over 25% Sodium - etc).  If I were to ever make this product again in the future, I would probably skip the packaged seasoning and just stick with the Mac and Cheese version.  I might even try one of the suggestions about turning it into a sort of salad.  In any case, this item did not bowl me over with flavor and I would not go out of my way to choose it over the other available "helper" products.  The 3 stars is for Average and Expected.

review/summary: Too much cheese and no other flavor
review/text: Velveeta seems to be getting into the packaged meal business late and they're offering little in the way of either innovation or flavor in doing so. The Cheesy Skillets meal I had was so bland that I had to put katchup on it to give it any kind of flavor. Cooking the beef, adding the sauce and then waiting at the end to add the cheese just meant that the elements didn't really have time to work together. Plus, the Velveeta itself just lacked a lot of flavor. I would most likely stick with other meals that add some kind of savory flavor to their contents.

Even so, there are nights when things don't go as planned and you need to feed the family.<br /><br />Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillets: Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac does taste like a cheeseburger.

You have to supply one pound of ground chuck and two cups of water.<br /><br />Taste Test: It's definitely not the most exciting meal. My daughter (2) gobbled it up, like she does everything. My son (7) liked it okay, but he said he liked it "just a little bit". My husband and I instantly agreed it tasted liked McDonald's-not Burger King or Wendy's-but McDonald's.<br /><br />It's about 350 calories for a one cup serving. The health benefits are minimal and it has partially-hydrogenated stuff in it. I doubt I will eat this again, mostly due to the processed nature of it. The taste was mediocre.<br /><br />It's ready in 20 minutes, but I can make risotto in 18 minutes, and I would MUCH rather have that!

review/summary: Tasty as Well as Easy
review/text: The Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac will be on my shopping list when I am in the market for such a product. It lives up to the hype on the package in that it is quick and easy to prepare, and tastes much better than similiar products by other companies. The reason for the superior taste is the cheese sauce, which unlike many other cheeseburger mac products is not powdered. Having an actual sauce instead of a powdered mix makes for a more natural taste, and, combined with the seasoning package, it has a tang to it that keeps it from the blandness of similiar products. In addition, because it is a real sauce instead of a powder, it is reconstituted with water instead of milk. How many times have you gone to prepare some dish and found that you did not have a key ingredient, including milk? Even though it is prepared with water instead of milk the sauce is still creamy. For those who like to use packaged dinners from time to time, this is a winner!

Also, we didn't use all the cheese; between the two of us, 3/4 of the Velveeta cheese was enough.<br /><br />Other than that, it was a great cheeseburger skillet meal with that great Velveeta cheesy taste we all like.  Took a little longer than 20 minutes between the two of us, but it turned out great in the end and we ended up with leftovers for another meal or two.

review/summary: Better without the seasoning packet
review/text: I like the convenience of this. I felt the seasoning packet was a little overwhelming. I think it would have been better just to add the cheese sauce and maybe a tiny bit of the seasoning packet. It cooked well in the time suggested. The pasta was done just right. It was very creamy, more than other cheesy box dinners. I would buy again, and just change the seasoning as mentioned. Good family dish. I think kids would like.

review/summary: an upgraded packaged skillet dinner
review/text: Convenience is not to be dismissed as a small consideration for many families today. This was an item I wanted to try on my own, especially my pasta-heads, those connoisseurs of all things cheesy, quick and calories be banned. If you have teens or visitors who can eat through a well stocked refrigerator in an afternoon then keep extra convenience foods like this on hand. In lieu of ground beef we used ground turkey (some concessions to health perhaps) as well as their favorite spicy sausage (cooked and crumbled)and I think further experimentation is more than possible. Comments from the hungry horde: better than regular Velveeta packaged pastas, thicker and a smoother texture with a powder pack that apparently added just the right extra kick to make the skillet dish hefty and capable of holding its own with all the additions we tossed in (ie. onions, red pepper cubes, the meats). This is meant to be an upgrade, straight from the box, and while it may never pass Emeril's lips what we found was alot more available versatility from this version of the well known staple. I have suggested we try such novelties as steamed broccoli, wine-glazed mushrooms, perhaps shredded smoked provolone tossed in at the last instead of the meats for veggie version. It is pretty much anything you want it to be, it can be dressed up or served as is; both are a major selling point in our household.

review/text: A dinner in a box!! Velveeta makes it super easy to get creative with this boxed dinner. If you don't want to brown your meat, then just open a can of chicken or tuna and use that.  You can even add some cooked vegetables to make additional servings.  I like the idea of adding cracker crumbs on top too.

review/summary: Cheesy yum
review/text: I used to love Hamburger Helper as a kid so I had to try this out, usually I try to eat healthy and as close to the ground as possible without ingesting too many refined products but once in a while it's okay to indulge in some cheesy goodness, and this was pretty nice.  A little salty but I do like salt and often have to hold back, it's a nice change from a regular protein free macaroni and cheese when I truly don't have time or energy to whip up a whole meal from scratch. This is best eaten from a bowl on a couch in front of the tv followed by a nap! Yum and cozy but definitely not for every day.

review/summary: Just Add Hamburger to Your Original Velveeta Shells and Cheese
review/text: Not that I was really expecting anything spectacular with this (in fact I think I ordered it on the vine program when I was hung over and in dire need of something heart stopping and liquor absorbing), but honestly, this is basically just Velveeta Shells and cheese with a little packet whatever spice it is that pasta dinner manufacturers add to give it that generic, pseudo "kick".  In short I was underwhelmed.  The original velveeta shells and cheese is pretty spectacular (that is, if you're in the market for something unspeakably unhealthy but infinitely comforting) and in my opinion, if it's not broke, don't fix it.

review/summary: Beef with noodles and creamy cheese sauce, YUMMY!
review/text: You can make this meal in less than 20 minutes and the best part is that you do not need any milk!  Velveeta comes to the rescue for those of us who are in a hurry because they provide us a large cheese sauce pouch in this box.<br /><br />First, before preparing this meal, you can choose either lean ground beef or something with a higher fat content like 80/20.  To test it out, I bought 1lb of 80/20 ground beef and prepared my Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac with it instead of the recommended beef.  The only real thing I changed with the quick preparation recipe was to also add some Cajun certified spice.  While mixing in the creamy Velveeta cheese, also sprinkle in 1 tablespoon of Southern Cajun Seasoning Low Sodium to give your meal a real spice kick without all that salt.<br /><br />I prepared my meal for a group of four adults, we finished it off quickly, even with a side of Green Peas and bread service.  If you have a growing, hungry family, then I suggest preparing two of these meals at once to have a little extra for lunch the next day.<br /><br />Overall, I was very satisfied with the cheesy flavor and noodles of this Cheesy Skillets meal.  Practically anyone can cook it so why not try it out for yourself today!

review/text: I decided to try out the Cheesy Skillets after being charmed by the goofy ads on TV. I discovered that this product does not need any doctoring at all, it's got plenty flavor. Maybe a little too much flavor. When I added the sauces, my elderly mother wanted to know who was burning garlic. The man of the house loved it though. So I'll probably wind up getting some more of this. It is very cheesy tasting, not too cheesy for me, but the garlic and onion flavoring did turn out kind of extreme for my taste buds. I'll try a different version than the Cheeseburger Mac next time out.

review/text: I was never a fan of Hamburger Helper, but I must admit that I like the new Kraft Velveeta Skillets Dinner Kits. When you whip this kit up, you get elbow macaroni pasta and ground beef, all in the creamy Velveeta cheese sauce. As with all similar Kraft dishes you must be a big fan of that cheese, as it does tend to dominate the taste of the dish.<br /><br />Everyone in my house seems to love it, and some days, when I am pressed for time, it is nice to have a dinner that I can throw together quickly and easily. Is it great food? Of course not, I definitely wouldn't recommend that you make it often. But, sometimes it really works!<br /><br />(Review of Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheesburger Skillets Dinner Kit)

review/summary: Another of these good Velveta Dinners!
review/text: It sounds like this is good and it is.  I would rate it slightly higher than the cheeseburger mac that hamburger helper does.  However, it should not go unnoticed that on sale at the grocery, HH is often a dollar or less per box. The price on this item on the Zon here is pretty far out there, so from that perspective add a star if you find this in the grocery or a good online sale.  Subtract one if you are going to buy it on some of the high prices it's offered for here.<br /><br />I'll give Kraft credit here for saving their brand name for me and doing a set of quality items in the package. The taste combined with my drained washed and reseasoned ground beef was very good.  I like to add a little red wine, some mushrooms and some half and half to the sauce on these to give them a classier taste.  The cheese held up well. I took exception to those eazy mac things they did up a few years ago.  I can't imagine anyone liking them unless they were starving!  The question I have on this product is why...  Yes there's improvement over HH, but not that much, they don't do much different, if they sent it with a can of pre-cooked ground beef, and you could just heat it up that would be something. I don't get how this can compete, especially at the price.

The seasoning packet was a really good too. We use this with ground turkey, but we found its really excellent with mushrooms too. The elbow macaroni is larger than the usual variety, making it a friendly size for kids to pick up. Its very similar to hamburger helper, and I think its really good.

Its easy, quick and tasty.<br /><br />All you need is water and ground meat to make a super easy main dish for dinner.  We used ground turkey to lower calories and be healthier. No one could tell the difference between it and ground beef.  The sauce is a good flavor and doesn't taste "fake" like some other one skillet dinner mixes (HH). Velveeta doesn't have a stong taste when eaten in a slice, but this sauce tasted really cheesy, as if it were cheddar based.  Its GREAT for those nights when you are just too tired from work to sit upright, let alone make dinner.<br /><br />I sadly can't eat this anymore, but if they come out with a Gluten Free version I'll be back.

review/summary: A Tasty Alternative Dinner
review/text: The kit comes with everything you need, except for one pound of hamburger.<br />As it has only makes 5 - 1-cup servings, we decided to make if for lunch, as it wouldn't be enough for 4 adults and 1 4 yr old who adores cheesy mac!<br /><br />For a change, we had no small packs of hamburger, or cooked hamburger left in the freezer, so I opted instead for a one pound pack of sausage that we had in the freezer instead. It was very simple to fry up the pork, and since it was so lean, it did not need to be drained, and then add all the pasta, seasoning packet and water to the pan. After a quick covered boil, all that was left was to add the Velveeta sauce! All in all it took less than a half hour and made up a pretty tasty lunch!<br /><br />My only quibble is that you need to keep an eye on when it is boiling. Ours was done in 9 minutes, not 11, as per the box. So don't leave it, or it might get too dry and burn!<br /><br />We ate it without any side serving, but for dinner I would serve a side salad and rolls with it. It was quite tasty and I would definitely make it again

review/text: This is basically the Velveeta Deluxe box set, but with a 2nd set of seasoning for the meat.  Honestly this style of liquid cheese is too salty for me and then they add a salty substance for your meat as well.  I think you could easily make a healthier version with a simple box of the regular Kraft Mac & Cheese.  And if you like the liquid cheese and want to save money - just buy the Velveeta Deluxe and add your hamburger or turkeyburger (whatever) to your liking.  The difference is minimal.  I tried the Broccoli version at the same time I bought this - I had the same feeling.  So in other words, you may like it - BUT you've been warned on what you actually get for your money.

review/summary: Better choices out there than this Salty Quickie.
review/text: Velveeta box pastas are pretty good. Not high culinary art but solid, easy to make and tasty. That is why this was a disappointment.<br /><br />  First this is no easier to make than melting Velveeta and mixing in pasta and beef. Cheeseburger flavor not really. Lastly it was salty. Really salty. Not usually a problem in a house where salty snacks are adored but every person mentioned it was too much salt. I knew by the flavor and reaction that if I ever made it again I would have to only ad part of the flavor pack. Why bother though when there is hamburger helper, other Velveeta box meals or you can just make put together the ingredients yourself.<br /><br />  This got two stars because it's easy to make, stores for a long time, great to take on a camping trip or college dorm. It is ok, just add the flavor pack to taste instead of by directions. Better yet buy something else.

review/summary: Hamburger Helper Should Have No Fear
review/text: This is Kraft Foods' entry into the "Hamburger Helper" market.  I prepared the meal according to the directions on the box and it delivered a perfect product in terms of consistency; it was neither runny nor too dry.  Preparation time was as described and it was easy to prepare.<br /><br />The most subjective part of this review is the product's taste.  While it was OK, it was just OK.  There was a slightly sour taste to the sauce (some may find this pleasing) and it was slightly gritty -- as if not all of the granules in the seasoning package had dissolved, although I feel I had stirred it thoroughly.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad meal but not one that I would seek out again.  I prefer the taste of the original Hamburger Helper product more.

review/summary: Too much like Hamburger Helper...
review/text: I made this for my family last night hoping that because they love velveeta shells and cheese that they would love this Cheeseburger Mac.  Unfortunately, once you add the seasoning and it's all made, it just tastes like Hamburger Helper, which we're not fans of.  You couldn't really even tell that it was a Velveeta product.  The cheese packet in it is the signature Velveeta gooey cheese in the foil.  I think the problem for me was the seasoning mix they ask you to add when you add the water and pasta.  If I would have left that out then it might have tasted like the cheesy taste I was looking for.<br /><br />If your family likes Hamburger Helper and one skillet meals like that, then you will probably love this as it was a little bit better than those meals... but I won't be buying this again.

review/summary: Makes me want to try the other "flavors"
review/text: As always, anything with Velveeta is _really_ good and after trying this dinner kit I really want to try some of the other kits they displayed on the box like the Nacho one and the BBQ chicken.  Yum!

review/summary: Quick, easy, tasty!
review/text: I loved this quick meal so much (my family and kids too) that i purchased more of them at my local grocery store. Creamy Velveeta cheese, bright flavors, and perfect noodle texture melt in your mouth and will leave the kids wanting more. Even my picky eater likes this one. With the ability to cook the whole thing in 20 minutes, it's perfect for busy moms and dads.

review/summary: Tastes Great!
review/text: My kids love Hamburger Helper so I figured this would be a great new product to try since anything with Velveta is good!  It was easy to make and only took a few minutes to complete.  The kids absolutely loved it and I thought it tasted great too.  My only complaint was that, visually, it was unappetizing.  It didn't look like the picture on the box.  It was kind of a grayish brown color and actually worried me a bit before I tried it.  Luckily, my kids and I don't really care how it looks so we all enjoyed it, but Kraft would benefit by working on presentation.

review/summary: Hamburger Helper
review/text: My wife and I have recently been turned onto Velveeta, and have begun to prefer their macaroni and cheese mix over the regular Kraft Mac & Cheese that we've bought in the past. Our kids seem to have enjoyed it too. When we saw these new skillet meals, we figured we'd give them a try. The cheeseburger meal we tried definitely wasn't something to be too excited about, but it did taste good. Throughout the whole meal, it reminded me personally of Hamburger Helper. I didn't feel like there was much of a difference other than the signature Velveeta cheese. The huge plus to all of it is that our picky kids who hardly eat anything ate up everything on their plates. To them it was another mac & cheese meal (even though there was other things thrown in), and that is all that mattered. From that perspective, the dinner was a huge success, and would definitely be something we'd want to purchase again.  It's hard to find meals where our kids will actually eat everything, and enjoy doing so. Too often than not they don't even try the meal, and yet says, "I don't like this."<br /><br />To sum it up, for adults, nothing too special. For kids, especially those that love mac & cheese, this was a winner for us.

review/summary: Better then Hamburger Helper
review/text: When my wife and I first got together we had a pantry full of Hamburger Helpers. We both worked late hours and it was great for a quick dinner. Back then, of course, they had a whole line of different flavors and varieties, rather then the stagnant line of 'meat and cheese' they have today.<br /><br />Fifteen years later we still keep a few Hamburger Helpers stocked at home, but we only have them about once a month. When Velveeta came out with their version, we gave it a try. I'm not a fan of other Velveeta products, but my wife is. This product, however, has won me over. It's better then Hamburger Helper in just about every way. First, it cooks much easier... Hamburger Helper has a powdered cheese mix that gets 'clumpy' and has to be rigorously stirred in order to mixed properly. I found the easiest way is to heat the cheese, water and milk in a separate pot, then add it as a mixture when it's time. This not only reduces heating time, but makes it easier to mix. Velveeta's Cheesy Skillets doesn't have that problem... the cheese is not powdered, so it mixes in without any trouble. There's an additional seasoning packet that is powder, but takes no effort to mix it in. So cooking-wise, Velveeta wins easily.<br /><br />As far as taste, Velveeta is FAR better. The seasoning adds a lot more flavor, and when we went back to Hamburger Helper to finish off the last box, we found it almost bland in comparison. Velveeta is a bit more expensive, but the price is well worth it... we haven't bought Hamburger Helper since. Of course, this is not exactly the healthiest meal, but when your time is limited and you need a bailout for dinner, I'd recommend Velveeta.

review/summary: Not bad, but definitely tastes like a boxed meal...
review/text: This is the second Velveeta skillet meal I received through the amazon Vine program. The first was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YV80OE">Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit, 14.64-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, and I have written a review of that product, as well, in case you'd like to compare the two.<br /><br />This product is clearly aimed at the same market of people who buy Hamburger Helper or Tuna Helper boxed dinners.  These meals are easy and quick to prepare - generally requiring nothing more than adding water and some pre-cooked meat to the ingredients of the box. As one might expect from the product title, this product is "cheesier" than most hamburger helper-type meals, but I also found it to be more flavorful, as well, and that was a good thing. It smelled good while cooking, looked appetizing, and my family of five enjoyed the meal. They didn't think it was anything spectacular, but no one turned up their noses at it, either.<br /><br />One thing that I should mention is this: My family of five downed this meal very quickly and had nothing left over for second helpings. I wouldn't really consider one box enough food for a family of five unless your family members are very light eaters. I don't even have any kids out of grade school, yet, and this wasn't enough food for us - even with all the other food set out on the table, which included bread, vegetables, and a dessert. If you have a large family or even a middle-sized family you may want to consider cooking up two portions of this meal if you're planning on satisfying everyone's appetites.

review/summary: Quick and easy
review/text: Brown up some hamburger, add the noodles, water, and the seasoning packet.  Cook it up til the water is gone, stir in the cheesy glop and its ready to eat!!<br />Flavor:  amazingly, the seasoning packet adds the flavor of hamburger additives (pickle, mustard, onions, very weird). The cheese packet adds the usual sort of cheese like flavor of velveeta. Overall, pretty bland and very salty.<br />Texture:  noodle mushiness is controlled by how much water you add and how long you let it cook.  Feels like you would expect.<br />Ease of use: A+ .<br />Overall value:  its fairly inexpensive and I suppose wouldn't be a terrible thing to have in the cupboard for those desperate nights when the kids are starving.<br />In reality, since you have to brown the hamburger, the time factor is a little more than I'd like for something that tastes this mediocre.  In the same amount of time or less there are many tastier healthier options for your family.  But compared to other meals of this type, this one is a middle of the roader. If your kids have a thing for the taste/feel of melty Velveeta, this might be the quickie meal for you.

review/summary: It really does taste like a cheeseburger
review/text: The Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillets Dinner Kit was surprisingly cheesy-tasting. I wish they had whole-grain pasta, but this is a shortcut for an easy meal. I also added a package of seasoning vegetables, which really improved it, but I bet most people, especially kids, will like it just the way it's designed to be prepared.

review/summary: very tasty
review/text: made this the other night and doctored it with a can of diced tomatoes and green peppers.  It was really tasty and my husband gobbled it down.  Real time saver too.  It says to cook on the stove, but you can cook it and then put it in a casserole dish in a warm oven.  I would definitely buy this again.

review/summary: Easy and Quick Dinner
review/text: Draft Veleeta Utimate Cheesburger Skillets dinner is a quick way to serve dinner when time and energy is in short supply. Granted, it is far from gourmet, but the kids will probably eat it up.<br /><br />It's simple to prepare and all that you will need to provide is a pound of ground beef that you have already fried up in a pan. Then, add water and noodles. Once those are cooked, it is a as simple as adding the package of velveeta. Along with a vegtable, or salad, it's a decent meal whipped up quickly.<br /><br />The good news about the taste is that it's pretty good. However, I prefer a bit more seasoning and the cheese is rather bland. Perhaps sprinkling some sharp cheddar on top would brighten up the taste a bit. Overall, though, it's much better than its closest competitor, Hamburger Helper.

review/text: This is a comparable product to Hamburger Helper.  The quality was very good.  Ease of cooking was high.  The sauce did have a good flavor to it.  The ingridents were of good quality.  If you want a quick easy dinner that taste good, this is a good alternative.

review/summary: Ok, for what it is
review/text: "Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillets Dinner Kit, 12.86-Ounce (Pack of 6)" is ok for what it is. It's easy and quick enough to make; except for the meat, everything you need comes in the box; and the flavor is tangy (if a bit too salty for my tastes). In all, while it wasn't my favorite mac n' cheese dish, "Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillets Dinner Kit" was ok enough that I can give this a slight recommendation.

review/summary: Great Product!  But too much for a meal
review/text: I really liked this product.  It tastes great and is easy to prepare.  The reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it is too much for a meal.  I liked it as a side dish with a large garden salad and some homemade whole grain bread.  This is the same opinion I had about the Velveeta Shells and Broccoli dinner.  Both are great but not as a meal unto themselves.  I enjoy Velveeta, but it is too much for an entire meal.  All in all though I would recommend this product to everyone who isn't lactose intolerant.  And I have to say that my nieces and nephews LOVED it!!

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: For out-of-the-boxed, processed-food quick skillet dinners, this one was pretty good! I don't know how they artificially simulated things like the taste of pickles, mustard, and onions, but this definitely tastes like cheeseburger. Sure, it's not healthy, but it's not terrible either (use lean beef). These boxed one-skillet dinners are designed for convenience, but often they're either overly salty or just bland. This strikes a good flavor balance.<br /><br />I fed this to my kids, and they both ate their servings and asked for seconds. And considering that one of them is a picky eater, and the other is 3 1/2 and so rarely finishes a serving of ANYTHING, that's a glowing endorsement.

review/summary: looks and tastes good
review/text: I never liked cooking and honestly, I never cooked good food. However, things have changed with Velveeta CHeesy Skillets. It tastes very very good and requires only a few minutes to prepare. When I served it to my girlfriend, she couldn't believe that I cooked it myself. If you don't have a lot of time for cooking but still want a good meal, go for this one. You won't be disappointed.<br />(Personally, it's a little salty, so you should not use the whole seasonal powder.)
