review/summary: DELICIOUS!
review/text: I don't much like sweet potatoes or things made with sweet potatoes, but these are really very good.  They have an unusual taste that is hard to describe.  It's a little on the sweet side; perhaps too sweet for some; great for others.  Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.  The extra you pay for these is worth it if you like this style of chip.  I can't imagine anyone not liking Popchips, although perhaps not everyone would like this flavor.  Give it a try and you will most likely be hooked.

review/summary: Sweet Potato Popchips
review/text: Decent tasting snack.  Definitely has a sweet potato flavor, so if you don't like that vegetable, you probably won't like the flavor of these.  One bag (0.8 oz or 23 g) contains 19 chips, has 100 calories, 3 g of fat, 95 mg of sodium, and 45 mg of potassium.  That isn't bad compared to many other snack foods.  For example, a comparable size bag of regular potato chips would have about 130 calories and 8 g of fat.  However, these Popchips don't taste like regular potato chips.  If you like the fatty, salty flavor of regular potato chips but are trying to cut back, I would recommend a reduced fat kettle chip variety instead.<br /><br />After reviewing the ingredients of these "natural" Popchips, they are not as healthy as I expected.  The first two ingredients are rice flour and sweet potato FLAKES.  The remaining ingredients are tapioca starch, sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil, organic yellow corn flour, seasoning (sea salt, dried cane syrup, maltodextrin, sweet potato powder, natural flavor, citric acid), sugar, and annatto (natural color).  They contain no fiber nor vitamin A, which I would expect to find in a sweet potato product.<br /><br />All in all, the Sweet Potato Popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods.  Obviously, something along the lines of an apple or some plain popcorn would be a healthier choice for a snack, but certainly would not be as enjoyable!

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: Put simply, these chips are full of flavor, texture and lower in calories than your average potato chip. They have a slightly salty but still sweet flavor. There's great "crunch" due to the fact that they have rice flour in them. They are not greasy since they are NOT fried. The only criticism is that they do not offer any significant fiber, being that the sweet potato is mixed with rice flour. I will absolutely purchase these as an alternative to a potato chip or a tortilla chip, for snacking.

review/summary: Great Alternative to Potato Chips
review/text: Simply put this is a great alternative to regular potato chips.  These chips are all natural; they have no preservatives or artificial flavors and colors. Each bag brings about 19 chips and are 100 calories (30 calories from fat).  The chips crunchy and have a very light sweet potato taste.  They also have an airy feel to them - like rice cakes. I enjoyed them.  For those that are gluten intolerant, they are also gluten-free.

review/summary: Salt and Pepper!!!
review/text: Popchips are delicious!!!  We bought a variety pack.  I love the Salt & Pepper though all flavors are good (according to my husband since I can't have any dairy I did not try those flavors).  While the chips are high in sodium, they are a nice healthy alternative to grease and salt laden fried potato chips.  Don't expect a traditional potato chip or even a pressed chip like Pringles.  They are different but delicious.  A 0.8 ounce bag contains only 100 calories and 10% of your daily salt (2000 cal diet).  The bag says they start with a potato and "add a little heat and pressure and.. pop."  Well, not quite.  The ingredients list: Natural Potato Ingredients (Potato Flakes, Potato Starch), Safflower Oil and/or Sunflower Oil, Rice Flour, Sea Salt.  If you need gluten-free, they are gluten free BUT they are made on equipment shared with wheat.

review/text: I absolutely love Pop Chips.  Cheddar is my favorite, but I thought I'd try these cause I like Parmesan too.  Just a word of caution....you'd better like garlic if you buy these because the garlic flavor definitely overwhelms the Parmesan flavor. All in all, these are great chips if you're watching your weight.  They are crispy and flavorful and much lower calories than regular chips.

These chips taste like a cross between potato chips and barbecue pork rinds but they are low in fat and they are NOT fried!  They are really crunchy and we LOVE the barbecue seasoning that they use on these.  We're sold -- we won't be buying any of those "other" potato chips anymore. I've going to end this review now because I just heard one of my kids open up another bag...

review/summary: A healthy alternative, but with overpowering and inconsistent flavor
review/text: These are definitely a healthier alternative than your standard potato chip - each bag (roughly 20 silver dollar-sized chips) has only three grams of fat and 100 calories. They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are "popped" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag.

review/text: I was already a big fan of the Popchips Salt and Vinegar flavor, so when I saw that they were coming out with a Chili Lime flavor I was so excited to try it! The flavor does NOT disappoint - tangy, spicy, and a dash of sweet. This is my new favorite "chip"! Now, if you've never tried Popchips before, just be aware that the texture is different than regular potato chips, somewhere between a traditional chip and a rice cake. It can throw off die-hard potato chip fans, but if you just want something crunchy and awesome tasting, without as many calories and fat, then this is going to be your new favorite snack!

review/summary: Chili Lime Flavor Review
review/text: I love Pop Chips. Parmesan Garlic and Sour Cream and Onion Pop Chips rock my world. They taste great, have a quirky crunch and are low cal/fat (in relation to traditional chips).<br /><br />Sadly though I must base this review on the Chili Lime flavor I was sent through the Amazon Vine program. These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't. Interestingly enough the aftertaste is actually better than the intial flavor of the chip itself.<br />I'm not saying this flavor is bad, it's just not that good.<br /><br />Overall, great brand with great flavors in general but Chili Lime doesn't stack up against the others.

review/text: OMG - these chips taste so good! I used to live in the UK and remember eating those delicious salt and vinegar chips. Flavor-wise these aren't as tart and vinegary as those, but they have a really nice twang to them that's not overwhelming, with some sweet/salty/savory overtones. Texture-wise these are light and airy. They are about 1/8 inch thick, like a mini rice cake though not as dense. They are great for dipping or eating all by themselves. The bag has just the right serving size. You don't feel too full afterward but they are definitely filling.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is because even though they are natural, they aren't organic, and most non-organic potatoes are GMO (genetically modified), so maybe not totally healthy, but definitely delicious!

review/text: Now the thought of a sweet potato chip might not initially appeal to everyone but I gave these a try and I am glad I did.  They are the right mix of sweet and salty so all those cravings get satisfied in one bite.  They are light and crispy.  If you have ever had a Muncho chip, they are similar in texture to those but not so salty like a Muncho.  You really don't get a strong sweet potato flavor and I at two small bags in one setting with ease.  They are low fat, low calorie (100 calories per bag which is a serving).  They contain natural ingredients like sunflower and safflower oil, sea salt, and organic yellow corn flour.  They are very very good.

review/text: I have a bag of Popchips everyday with lunch. So needless to say I love Popchips. When I saw a new flavor available on Amazon of course I had to try it. Chili Lime sounded interesting, and it is indeed an interesting flavor. There is a big hint of lime along with the "chili" flavor which is hard to explain. I think this is one of those things that you just have to try for yourself if it sounds interesting. They're decent enough that I will finish off the box, but I can't say I would buy this flavor again.

review/summary: This stuff should be illegal!
review/text: Forget heroin...  Forget cocaine...  Forget meth...  NOTHING is more addictive than these "chips".  Heed these words: these "chips" will cause the downfall all modern civilization.<br /><br />In all seriousness, these things are very tasty, and nowhere near as bad for you as an old fashion potato chip.<br /><br />My wife picked up a small bag in an airport vending machine while on a trip.  She saved a few "chips" for me to try when she got home.  I was so impressed with the taste, and the nutrition label, that I immediately thought of my dad.  He loves a good snack item (don't we all?), but with a recent diabetes diagnosis, and the ever increasing challenge to lose a few pounds, his "snacking" options have been getting pretty sparse.<br /><br />So I shoot him a text message, and include a picture of the nutrition label from the back of the bag.  Seconds later I get a text message back:  "Are you kidding?  We're the reason Pop-Chips stock doubled last quarter!  Put all your stock into BBQ Pop-Chips. They will replace crystal meth soon!"<br /><br />Now, I haven't tried the other flavors yet.  If you look through the feedback on the other flavors, not all of them appear to be smash hits.  But you can't go wrong with Original.  Definitely give these things a try.  You won't be disappointed.

review/text: Popchips are really a great snack and not just an alternative to regular chips but a full on replacement as far as I'm concerned. The taste and texture are great for the Jalapeno ones. I hate greasy fried chips and often switch the baked version of any chips. Now I have another choice...POPPED! If you like flavored chips and you want something crunchy with a great taste then you owe it to your self to try a bag of Potato Popchips!

review/text: This is a great product for those attempting to loose weight.  I currently participating in Weight Watches, they have a product that is similar but with less taste.  I prefer the popchips because of the flavor and it counts for the same amount of points in Weight Watchers.<br /><br />Thank you.

review/summary: Delicious alternative (all but the Sweet Potato variety)
review/text: I really like these. They are 3 points plus points on Weight Watchers and are much cheaper than the WW branded BBQ chips. My favorite flavor is the salt and pepper.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />They created new flavors and I enjoy most of them. However, the Sweet Potato Popchips are now my least favorite Popchips. The flavor and texture just didn't translate well to the Popchips style chips. They tasted odd, almost burnt. Salt and Black Pepper as well as Cheddar remain my favorites.

review/summary: bbq chips through amazon
review/text: Chips were fresh and securely packaged. It was not cost effective to pay retail and have to wait for delivery. Where was the advantage...other than to compensate for poor distribution throughout their stores? I like the chips (especially the cheese) and will continue to buy them. They are very pricy, so I will by them when I see them.

review/summary: Popchips Jalapeno flavor
review/text: I bought a case of jalapeno chips as I love that flavor. This product is good but does not taste like the other jalapeno chips on the market (Lays, Ms.Vickie). I am now used to this flavor and eat it as it is healthy but wish it had that addicting jalapeno flavor that the other ones on the market have.

review/summary: Garlic, Salt, Pepper, Chip  Enjoy
review/text: I have always enjoyed this flavor of popchip and they are highly addictive.  Which makes the money saving 24 pack such a deal.  The problem with the the 3 oz. is that you eat them until your in a coma and the rest go stale.  The 1 oz. allows you to stop sooner without wasting good food.  I don't like the extra bags to through away but the 3 oz wastes food and money.  I actually found that at the time I purchased these the 24 x 1 pack here was cheaper than the 12 x 3 pack.  My only hope would be that they introduce a larger resealable for less.  These chips with their simple salt and pepper flavour go with almost everything.  So enjoy.  Bonn Appetite!

review/text: These pop chips are satisfying and good for a snack, but not what I expected.  They do not taste as good, crisp or as light as the Weight Watchers brand that is so hard to find in stock.  I wish Amazon could carry the actual Weight Watcher's Brand chips - They are the best snack out there.

review/text: Saw these chips about 9 months ago and bought the BBQ  at a Giant store in their organic section.<br />These chips are light but tasty and have a good BBQ flavor.<br />Of course they aren't  Herr's or Lays but a good for you substitute. These chips are popped like pop corn. The package explains the process.<br />Trader's Joe's, sells their version for $1.99 a dollar less than Giant but I swear they are the same chips with different names.<br />Try them.

review/text: Love original flavor PopChips, it reminds me so much of Munchos.  I love that there is a healthier alternative that actually truly tastes good!  BBQ flavor is excellent too.  Although I love salt and vinegar chips, I wasn't crazy about their version.  The sour cream and onion and the cheddar were also so-so.  Out of all the flavors, original is my favorite.  You don't feel you're compromising anything with this alternative chip.  Way to go PopChips!

review/summary: Yummy low cal chip
review/text: I ordered a box of 24 of the variety pack of these after trying a couple of different flavors from my cafeteria at work.  This is a really great alternative to chips and they are really flavorful.  I typically take a sandwich to work everyday and was buying a small bag of pretzels or baked chips in the cafeteria.  I found these and they have the same texture as a chip, but have fewer calories and taste better.  After trying the variety pack, I really love the BBQ flavor the best.  My husband really loves the sea salt and vinegar flavor.  I do enjoy the cheddar potato as well, but we are subscribing to receive the BBQ and the salt and vinegar on a periodic basis since those are our favorites.  The original is rather plain, the parmesan and garlic is very garlicky, the salt and pepper is OK, but I'm just not a huge pepper fan so I'm probably not a good judge.  I really don't enjoy the sour cream and onion which is interesting because I do enjoy that flavor with other chips.<br /><br />So bottom line, great chip, great alternative to other chip options.  Low calorie, low fat, and the subscription option is really convenient since I can't seem to find the individual bag option at any store in my area.

Went on to my account at amazon.com to let them know and Amazon said I "could not take any action" because I "hadn't received the shipment yet."  Then what is this box in front of me?????  Anyway, I need the chips for a party in two days, so guess I am stuck with the assorted box.  5 stars for the salt & b=vinegar chips, but 1 star to amazon for the screw-up.

review/summary: the garlic parmesan pop chips
review/text: If you really love lots of garlic, you will love these. I like garlic but these have too much.....the garlic overrides the taste of parmesan so they might just as well call these garlic chips. You will have the garlic taste in your mouth for a looooong time.<br />In spite of that, I do love the pop chips especially the barbeque(which is strong but good) and the cheddar. I also like the plain but only when I have already eaten something spicy. The other varieties aren't bad either. I like these chips because they also help my cravings and I can eat them and have been able to lose weight which I really have needed to do. Although more expensive than traditional chips, I look at it as a trade off for a more healthy lifestyle.<br /> I only gave a 4 because of the overly garlic "parmesan garlic" pop chips. Otherwise I would have given a 5.

review/text: I normally HATE fake chips.  I don't even really like real chips, but if I'm having a chip, I don't want any of those taro, cassava whatevertheheck kind of chips.  They border on disgusting.  I was tentative to try these when I got them.<br /><br />I was surprised.  These chips are thick, airy and wonderful.  The BBQ flavor is the closest I've had to "real" BBQ chips.  I could eat a whole bag.<br /><br />I wouldn't call them a healthy snack, but they are more healthy than regular chips and quite enjoyable.  I can't believe I like a fake chip!

review/summary: My favorite brand of chips
review/text: When I first heard about Popchips I thought they'd end up tasting like either kettle cooked chips or Cape Cod style chips. I was wrong. They are light, airy, and have a great taste to them... (a note to the makers of Popchips, however, there does need to be better quality control - I will randomly get a bag of chips that are, for lack of a better description I'll say "harder" than the majority of the batches I buy.)<br /><br />The Salt & Pepper variety is the flavor I love the most. It has a nice kick to it (if you're not into heat, you might want to stay away from this flavor and stick with my other favorite 'original'... otherwise, just have a bottle of water nearby.) I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is a lover of chips.

review/text: I was really excited to try these out as salt & vinegar has always been my favorite flavor. I have to say that the taste is spot on but the texture was off-putting for me. I could get used to and somewhat liked the stale cracker feel but they left an awful coating in my mouth. It was akin to plain Smartfood popcorn. I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again. However, the two positives are that they are significantly cheaper on Amazon by almost a $1.50 per bag and have less fat content than baked. If you're a fan, this is a great choice.

review/summary: Healthy Chips at a super price
review/text: If you are addicted to potato chips, or just love snacks, you may want to grab some of these.  I picked up my first bag at a store about 80 miles from home because they are low in fat.  The flavor is excellent and they are crisp and fresh packed in what looks like a foil package.  At only 4 grams of fat per ounce, these are the best flavored chips I have found.<br />Buying from Amazon brings the chips to my door at less cost than buying at a local store and I don't need to spend my time or money for transportation to get them. They are well packaged in the box and each bag is sealed with a volume of air that keeps it from squashing and breaking the contents in transit.<br />All in all a great flavorful low-fat snack that hits the spot.  if there is any negative at all, it is that with 12 bags in the cabinet, I need to ration them to myself so I don't pig-out on them.  Enjoy !

review/text: Pretty much can't go wrong with these. Very peppery. Good potato flavor. Cruchy, but not mouth-injuringly so (you know how some brands of chips can be). Plus if you are extremely fastidious, you will undoubtedly enjoy the uniformity of size and shape that these chips have.<br /><br />Like Pr*ngl*s they are made from potato starch rather than actual sliced potatoes, but unlike those and other similar brands, they do not leave me feeling like I ate spoonfuls of vegetable shortening after consuming half a bag.<br /><br />The only other flavor of Popchips that I like are the plain original flavor. The other ones have poorly constructed flavor profiles in my considered opinion. Sometimes if you want to go lowfat, you really need to go simple with the seasoning, and it doesn't get much simpler than salt and pepper.

It has the tang of a regular chip with BBQ flavor, but has the light and non-salty taste of a healthy snack. I literally had to hide the bag to prevent eating them all in one sitting. With a nice glass of sparkling water, they are a true treat and a great alternative to the usual processed chips we've all come to know, love, and mindlessly consume. I truly suggest you open your mind and buy a bag. These were absolutely wonderful to have as a late night snack, a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, and something to share with the children in my life. After one bag, you might not want to share.

review/summary: Delicious low fat treat.
review/text: Popchips are the best find I have found in a long time.  You want to eat healthy, and at the same time sometimes, you want something yummy.  Regular chips are high in fat, low fat chips give you stomach problems, baked chips taste not good to me, Popchips a little bit of heaven.  4 grams of fat vs. 10 of regular chips, they use sea salt, they crunch, and to me taste like regular chips minus the grease.  As usual, things that taste good and are made healthy cost more than the high fat item, that is just the way it seems to work.  However, this treat in my opinion is worth your money, as so many other healthy treats are expensive and taste not so great.  I hope you will enjoy them I do and my family does too.

review/text: I have been a long time seeker of junk food substitutes to help maintain my weight. I will never again, and I repeat, NEVER, buy another baked chip again. These are by far, the best "healthy" chip in the biz! Parmesan Garlic has got to be the best flavor, but sour cream n onion come in at a close second. I order these, box after box, and have never been disappointed. If you are on the fence about whether to try them, go for it!

review/summary: This picky eater loves them!
review/text: I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is "sweet" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account.

WOW ~ very tasty!  around $1.25 a bag with 3 servings (I open the bag and immediately put them in snack bags), it's about 50 cents a bag.  Well worth it with a weight watcher points plus value of 1 !  These are also fantastic by crumbling them on top of casseroles after cooking.  They have a lot of flavor to offer!  I can't say enough about them.  Buy and find out for yourself ~ give yourself a treat!

review/summary: Popchips are amazing!
review/text: An entire bag of the 3-ounce Popchips are only 360 calories and are very low in fat. I can snack on this or even replace lunch with some of them. There is just the right amount of salt and, despite being produced very unlike traditional chips, the expected crunch is still present. The only complaint I have is that the material of the chip is actually fairly coarse and if you're eating them quickly, I find the roof of my mouth gets a little raw.

review/text: I have tried all of the flavors of Popchips and the Original is my favorite.  You know those chips Munchos that you get at convenience stores?  Well, these kind of remind me of them but they are: 1) tastier, 2) less salty, 3) less processed tasting and 4) better for you.  These are great snacking chips, good with dip, but definitely great on their own.  Crunchy and delicious!  If you like potato chips, you will definitely like Popchips.  Only thing that is weird is that some of the bags are saltier than others - I am not sure why.

review/summary: Healthier alternative for chip fix
review/text: In the last 8 years or so, there's been a potato chip Renaissance in the US.  I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a "sometimes" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.  And at considerably less calories and fat - it's a no brainer.
