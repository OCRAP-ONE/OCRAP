review/summary: Very delicious, but very high in sodium
review/text: I am a ramen lover and have tried hundreds of varieties over the years, including my time in Japan, the land of endless ramen varieties. Nong Shim (Korean) is a long-time favorite and among the top 3 makers on my list. Their noodles are heartier and more delicious than everybody else's, mostly because they use better ingredients. The texture is firmer and more elastic, even retaining their chewy mouth-feel over time, unlike other noodles that quickly become mushy. If you're used to bargain basement brands like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061I6UE">NISSIN TOP RAMEN</a>, do yourself a favor and try a Nong Shim.<br /><br />Among the higher quality ingredients that Nong Shim puts in here are ginger and shrimp extracts, beef and pork bone stock, and beef tallow. Beef tallow is the same stuff that makes McDonald's french fries so tasty.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ very tasty, spicy, and filling<br />+ excellent texture to vegetable seasoning pack (dried cabbage, carrots, onions, mushroom). I can actually taste the veggie bits.<br />+ 0mg cholesterol and no trans-fats<br /><br />Cons<br />- 500 calories in 1 pack. 160 of which are fat calories<br />- 40% of your daily saturated fat intake<br />- EXTREMELY SALTY: 94% of your daily sodium intake if you drink the soup<br /><br />Despite directions for boiling the noodles for 3 minutes, it can be prepared with just boiling water and a bowl. I made some with hot water from the office Flavia machine (coffee and tea maker) and waited 5 minutes.<br /><br />Because of the very high sodium and fat content, instant ramen should not be eaten often. But in a pinch (either due to lack of time, money, cooking skills, or all 3), ramen can provide a quick and filling meal. It is very easy to add vegetables and leftovers to it to mitigate the saltiness and provide better nutritional value. Ramen alone is just calories, fat, and salt and offers little nutrition. The powder packet packs a punch, and half a pack or less is sufficient for full flavor and to reduce the sodium level.<br /><br />Canned corn can be added (a popular topping in Japan), soft boiled egg, shredded green or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I02JBY">Chinese/Nappa cabbage</a> or other vegetables, kimchi, spring onions, boiled shrimp or fish fillet, or whatever you like. The soup packet can also be used to make a pot of spicy soup, as you would use a soup mix or bouillon cube.<br /><br />Instant ramen is unhealthy, because they are fried in palm oil or some other fat, then dried and packaged. But if you're going to eat something bad for you, might as well have it be delicious, and this Nong Shim variety is among the best.<br /><br />Product made in CA.

review/text: i'm surprised reading the 2 reviews saying there's no kimchi but the box of kimchi noodles i ordered does have bits of kimchi but they're small and few. I've tried quite a number of instant noodles but this is the ONLY one that i actually would finish the broth. the other brands i just ate the noodles.

review/summary: Not as spicy as Kimchi Bowls, which I am glad for!
review/text: These noodles are actually edible in the sense that they are not anything like the overly spicy bowl equivalent.  The Kimchi bowls are way too hot for me.  These ramen packs are perfect. Some spice, but I am able to drink the broth using the entire packet.  I am glad I found these inexpensive snacks that are not too hot.<br /><br />I also like the Beef and Ginger bowls, those are not spicy at all.

review/summary: I could eat these every day
review/text: These noodles are far superior to the ones sold at my local grocery store. The noodles taste fuller and have a richer texture, the seasoning does not taste like food coloring, and the dried veggies pouch is awesome.<br /><br />The only modification I do, when having me some Ramyun, is a cracked egg. Once the noodles get soft enough to where I can break the block and stir them around a bit, I crack an egg straight in the pot. I give the egg about 20 seconds so it can coagulate just slightly, and then I gently stir it in the noodles for another minute or so.<br /><br />I love having nothing to eat at the house, because I have Ramyun noodles.

review/summary: Best Instant Noodles I've had...
review/text: First of all, it tastes great. I've had the Shin Ramyun, Neoguri, and Chapagetti from Nong Shim, and this Kimchi Noodle Ramyun outdoes them all. The spiciness is JUST right, the saltiness is at a good level, the flavor is rich and full, the noodles are firm and have good texture... and best of all, it's easy to make in a microwave. Just throw in a microwave bowl, add water, and microwave for 7 minutes or so (don't take my word for the time... it depends on your microwave).<br />I've lived in Japan most my life (Japan is the paradise of instant noodles... I REALLY know my instant noodles), and ever since I moved to America recently, I've been craving for GOOD instant noodles (not the cheap, crummy stuff in styrofoam cups like Maruchan...). This satisfied my craving.<br />The sodium and oil and whatever are bad for you. Of course. It's instant noodles. Deal with it :D

review/summary: Best Ramen, hands down!
review/text: I used to eat brands like Nissin and Maruchan, but then I found this in my local grocery store, and I love it! The broth is thick, hearty, and spicy, and the veggie bits give it a more authentic taste. The only problem is the sodium content, but virtually every instant ramen has too much sodium.

review/summary: Best Ramen Hands Down!!!
review/text: Best Ramen Hands Down!!! The noodles are bigger and have better flavor and the broth has such better flavoring than Top Ramen and Maruchan. They are pricier but if you're eating ramen by itself as a meal, this is the way to go. If you're just boiling noodles for stir fry or whatever, you can get away with other brands. The Kimchi flavor is by far the best. I tried this brand/flavor when it was on sale on a whim not knowing if it would be good or not and boy was I surprised.<br /><br />The noodles come in a brick that is circular! No more breaking up square bricks to fit in small pans! They come with a seasoning packet and a vegetable packet which is nice. You definitely don't need the entire seasoning packet...in fact you can get by with HALF of it without it tasting too weak, but greatly reducing your sodium intake. They are on the spicy side but so is Kimchi(cabbage rubbed in chili powder and pickled).<br /><br />If you just want to try a single bowl or foil package try your local asian grocer or sometimes my local wally-world carries the Styrofoam bowls in the Kimchi flavor around a buck.

review/summary: This is a favorite of mine
review/text: This is a favorite of mine, mainly because I like the flavor and I think the noodles hold up better than most.  It is not health food, too much sodium and fat, so if that is what you are after look else where.  If you want something a bit unique in the ramen world this is it.  I love the flavor and the unique spiceyness of this soup.  It develops a nice burn at the back of your throat somewhat like a hot and sour soup, but a different flavor.  It has the noodles, a small packet of dried kimchi bits, and a packet of flavoring.  Like all ramens I have seen, not much more than noodles and flavoring so it never hurts to throw in your own touches while cooking, like an egg to thicken the broth, or some shrimp and veggies to complete it.

review/summary: Substantial and tasty
review/text: This is the Cadillac of the instant ramen soups- without a doubt. The noodles used by Nongshim are quality, thick, and provide decent bite. The instant soup component is flavorful, spicy, and tastes like a real broth- no artificial business here. Kimchi flavor is limited and slight, but the included bits of freeze-dried cabbage give the impression that an attempt was made.<br /><br />As noted by other reviewers, the sodium is through the roof in this and other instant noodles soups. Though delicious, slurp down a bowl full of soup broth at your own peril.<br /><br />As for preparation, I've found that cooking only requires adding hot water from an office water dispenser. Have not needed to use a microwave.

review/summary: Best Kimchi Noodles there is...UPDATED
review/text: Any instant isn't as good as the real thing, but for instant, Nongshim makes a decent group of instant noodles. This is probably the best kimchi instant noodles out there. Avoid Paldo; that is total garbage. Add an egg to this to really add some flavor, but be warned, it may make the soup a little bland. Add a tiny bit of kimchi juice to it, to spice it up.REMEMBER!!! do NOT overcook the noodles. It is disgusting if you overcook the noodles. The noodles cook in the hot broth anyway, so turn off stove early on, and don't add too much water of you will get bland soup. And don't let soup evaporate too much, or you will get salty soup. It's all about balance. :) good luck!<br /><br />UPDATE: YUP, you gotta microwave it! otherwise, it's gross. I know, you smarties are probably laughing your donkeys off. :) I've revised it to 5 stars. It's pretty good. But let it cool off for 3 mins. you'll burn your mouth off, if you try it while 'hot'. soup is spot on. noodles are pretty decent!

review/summary: Flavor is just not there.
review/text: Let me start with a few things. I love Nong Shim's Shin Ramyun. I am also a big fan of kimchi. So I thought what could be a better combination than that? So I ordered a case of these from amazon during the back to school sale. I must say I was very disappointed. First of all the noodles are more of the traditional ramen noodle, not the thicker type you get with the Shin Ramyun. (So disappointment #1) Then the flavor of this was not good at all, it wasn't like adding kimchi to a bowl of the Shin Ramyun stuff at all. To be honest the flavor was quite off putting. Now I have a case of these noodles I have no idea what to do with.

review/text: I always get a kick out of the reconstituted veggies growth :)<br /><br />The base is chili-flavored more than anything.  The veggies/napa has a hint of the kimchi acidity.  The noodle is Nong Shim's normal brick, which is pretty good.<br /><br />I eat this with kimchi from a jar, and it's pretty good that way, too - a few pieces of cabbage dropped into the soup with the noodle after the water's been added, adds a bit more heat and just the right acidity for breakfast (someone out there is going 'Eew, gross!')<br /><br />Getting this by the case from Amazon saves me a trip to the local Oriental market, which is a bit out of the way and saves me a Saturday afternoon, a rare and precious commodity.

The three of these taste pretty similar in many respects, all with spicy, red sodium-loaded broths and hearty noodles. Where this one differs is the presence of tiny pieces of "kimchi" in the dried veggie pack- they're no bigger than the size of a fingernail, so don't expect actual chunks of kimchi in this. The flavor is nice, comparable to the others, and I enjoy it; sodium is about 94% DV per pack

These rice noodles are the very thin, crunchy noodles that do not detract from the stir fry ingredients by being thick and and almost taking over the dish.  These noodles have been available in grocers for years but as of the past two years are slowly disappearing from the shelves.  Now only the fat, thick noodles are for sale.  Each can of noodles will serve two people.  The noodles will keep for months and months on the shelf so don't be concerned about buying 12 cans.

It tastes good at room temperature straight from the cupboard, or chilled from the frig, or heated.  I've never met anyone who disliked baba ghannouge, which makes it a good thing to keep on hand for unexpected guests.  People of all ages like it, so it's good for taking to potlucks and picnics etc.  Besides all that, it's very nutritious, satisfying, and easy on your system.<br /><br />I have been gratefully using this product, along with the company's canned hummus, for many years.  To me, this is one of those genius products that is just always there for you, like peanut butter.<br /><br />I will add that, technically, both this and the company's canned hummus are produced with the idea that you will probably tweak it a little to your taste for the standard use.  The standard for that would be:  Olive oil, lemon juice, salt (possibly); and perhaps some paprika or a little hot sauce.  My Lebanese friends instructed me to also add extra tahini to canned hummus.  I agree this can be nice but I don't always bother.  If you keep a jar of tahini on hand for that and other uses such as stirfry, then great; but you probably don't need to bother buying it just for this.  Note that the flavor of real olive oil does highlight baba ghannouge and hummus, so you want to try to use that.  This is trickier than it seems, because many "olive oil" products are not really olive oil (sunflower oil is a common replacement).  There is a lot of fraud in the olive oil industry for some reason.  Anyway - just mentioning that, because you'll enjoy these two dips much more if you have real olive oil.

review/summary: Tasty and Healthy
review/text: This is a really good dip for vegetables and pita.  The only ingredients are eggplant, tahini paste, and salt, so it is pretty natural and basic.  I took it to work and popped the can, which is highly convenient for travel since you don't need an opener.  It tasted fine, but kind of bland.  There's a bit of a smoky flavor.  I mixed in some olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic like the can says to do (if I only I would read directions first) and its really good.  I agree from the other reviewer that the consisency is quite think like hummus, but it is not made out of chickpeas.  It isn't the same as the babaganoush I get at restaurants, but it is still good for a can product.  I'm a big fan of eggplant if made properly.  You also get alot for the price, I can make four meals out of this.  I will definately buy again.  I also bought the hummus from Alwadi.

review/text: Very good dip. It does need a little doctoring up and garlic and freshly ground pepper help a lot. I don't think you need to add any lemon as it's tangy enough. It makes for a very nice snack or light meal with bread and fresh cheese. I love eggplants but I don't always have the time or inclination to roast them. It's a treat to be able to pop a can when I want convenience and it's great to save pennies on the bulk purchase with prime delivery.

review/summary: Took a chance....
review/text: We love our homemade babaganoush but it takes a while to prepare and the local eggplants don't always look great. So last month when time was particularly tight I decided to try alwadi babaganoush. We had used their tahini and found it excellent.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I07884">Alwadi Al Akhdar Baba Ghannouge, Eggplant Dip, 12.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />But still, canned babaganoush? How good could that possibly be any good?<br /><br />One big question was how they flavored it. How would their balance of tahini, lemon, oil, herbs and spices turn out to be? Well, it was only 12 small cans, and if I didn't like it my husband would probably still eat it.<br /><br />Another question for me was whether it would contain ingredients I can't eat as a gluten-free person. Fortunately Amazon let me see the ingredients list, and there's nothing in there I would put in in my own kitchen - pretty amazing for today's prepared foods.<br /><br />When it came, we tested it right away by having some for lunch. We ate it with rice crackers. Wow, the taste was great. In fact, the taste was just like homemade. This product is going to stay on my subscription list at Amazon.<br /><br />That little can lasted for two meals for the two of us eating all we wanted. I'm delighted with this product, another alwadi success, and recommend it to anyone who loves eggplant.

review/summary: dogs like to eat them / I like to carry them
review/text: These are high-value treats.  My dogs highly value their deliciousness (even my picky cattle dog).  I highly value how easy they are to carry.  These treats aren't crumbly, yet are easy to break apart, and don't get your hands dirty.  I use them mostly on off-leash walks with my two dogs, to reinforce recalls -- especially useful for my newer adoptee, who's only been with me 9 months.  I can take one bacon man out of my fanny pack and carry it in my hand while hiking, then split it between the two dogs when they race back to me, for instant reinforcement -- no digging in pockets or fumbling with baggies, but instead instant reward (half a man each is plenty!).  And my hands stay clean!  These bacon/cheese men are now my go-to treats for training on the go.

review/summary: Too Small for Us Now
review/text: It was a five star for me, but I don't know that it will be for others.<br /><br />My rescue White Husky/Samoyed mix, Hope, absolutely LOVES these treats. The flavor must be fantastic to her senses. She can smell them from the other side of the house! Just opening the package brings her running.<br /><br />When I first got her from the shelter, at age 9, she had been badly mistreated and was very ill with heartworm. She was sick and frightened, and didn't have much of an appetite. She just picked at her food. She would nibble a couple of these and then retreat. I took her through the heartworm treatment protocol, which was 4+ months long, very painful, and scary for both of us, not to mention extremely expensive. (Fortunately, the rescue group paid for the heartworm treatment.) Luckily, I wasn't working outside the home at that time. I had to be inside the house with her 24/7. She could not go outside except to poop and to pee. That was it. Nothing could elevate her heart rate. It was my job to make sure it didn't.<br /><br />As she began to feel better, she wanted more treats. These are tiny (around 1" square) and really not appropriate for a large dog, but she loved them so. After a while, when Hope felt better, we moved on to Newman's Own Organic Dog Treats. I now buy them in bulk from Amazon (good price). I still have some Buddy Biscuits, and if I want her to be an "especially good girl" I'll break them out. She will do anything for them.<br /><br />My girl has found her forever home where she is now happy, healthy and well-cared for. At 66 lbs. she has had extensive (read: expensive) dental work, enough to set her new adoptive mom back a few months in expenses.  But we'll eventually be fine with that, and she can crunch those harder treats now.<br /><br />The Buddy Biscuits were a step for us. She found them soft and delicious. Her teeth were painful, but the scent of those treats was so enticing. They may or may not be just right for your small dog. I'd recommend buying one package and trying it out first.<br /><br />And please, if you have a dog, be sure it's on some kind of heartworm preventive treatment. Prevention is so much less expensive than treatment in terms of money, pain, worry, and care!!!<br /><br />Heartworm is passed by mosquitoes. One bite from an infected mosquito can do it. My friend said, "My dogs fur is so thick that a mosquito can't bite her." My vet said, "They bite inside the ear." No one is safe.

We love these treats they are great for small dogs and easy to chew. But the best part is there is no corn,soy,artificial colors,artificial flavors or byproducts. They also don't have several other ingredients that are bad for your pets health. And the other great thing something make in the good old USA.

review/summary: Devoured, but Allergic Reaction Coupled with Shedding and Weight Loss
review/text: I adopted a dog recently from a rescue organization - a pit bull/mastiff 3 year old - who came to me fat, happy and with an overall positive outlook on life, regardless of the fact that his owners had left him to rot in an abandoned apartment building.<br /><br />Being a first time dog owner, I put him on this food because it came recommended to me by my local pet store in Austin, TX and it was the cheapest quality dog food (by weight) there.  The dog ate this food for about three weeks and every single time I put it out in a bowl, he would devour it right away.  He eats really fast and this food does not cause him to choke or spit the food back up - although now, three weeks later, I almost wish he had.<br /><br />In about two weeks time, I began to notice patches of fur gone in his coat and LOADS of shedding everywhere in my small apartment.  I was using the Furminator to shed him about twice a week and one time, I drew blood.  He was also scratching and licking himself raw.  Within three weeks, his collar had gotten too big for him - meaning, of course, rampant weight loss.  That was it: I brought him to the vet and they told me it was hard to tell because he's a rescue and their medical histories are difficult to conclude - so, it could either just be the change of weather from summer to fall or it could be his food or it could be that he is just stressed out from shifting environments and owners.  I switched his food anyways, because I was tired of the fur and felt sorry for him, even though he loved the taste of Canidae.  Within a week, the shedding stopped and he stopped scratching.<br /><br />I dug up some reviews online about Canidae and the opinions seem pretty mixed.  Either people's dogs love it and do incredibly well on it or it causes extreme negative reactions, anything from nausea and vomiting to allergies, which is ironic considering it is grain-free.  After all the digging, I personally conclude that it is because Canidae changes their formula periodically and their quality, although rated highly in terms of their ingredients, is inconsistent because of their processing methods: as in, nobody seems to be quite sure where they process their ingredients and when they do change their formula, whether this change affects that process.<br /><br />Its such a shame because it is a bang for your buck and my dog loved the taste of it.  I just wish Canidae would be more transparent about their process and maybe tell their consumers why there are such polarized reactions by dogs when they consume this food.  Overall, it was definitely a learning experience.  For me, the food rates at 2 (not a 1, because the price is great for the quality of ingredients) since my particular dog's reaction was negative.

It DOES NOT taste exactly like coffee, but can easily be used as a substitute.  I added brown sugar and Bailey's brand of Irish Creamer to it, and thoroughly enjoyed every sip.  I did not mix it with any regular coffee whatsoever, but instead decided to just try a cup of the product alone.  I must say, it is very DELICIOUS.  I am looking forward to trying some of the other flavors.  What I like even more about it, is that it is made with herbs and nuts; you can hardly go wrong with that!

If you really have to have a sweetener of some kind, try a hazelnut creamer, as it helps make it palatable to those who need a little sweet with their coffee.

review/summary: EXACTLY AS DECRIBED!!!!
review/text: I signed up for the subscription and received my 4 bottles for only $11.77 with free shipping. With a subscription you can choose to reorder in 1,2,3, or 6 month intervals and cancel at any time. Ordering this way saves 15% plus free shipping. I ordered on the weekend and received my package in 5 days with the box and contents in very good condition.<br /><br />The honey is exactly as described by the company. While it is unfiltered it is strained, which the company does state. So, if you're looking for honey with pieces of honey comb and such this honey is not for you. The important thing is that they heat the honey at a lower temperature which preserves the enzymes (destroyed in supermarket type honey). Side by side comparison to store bought honey there are notable differences. It is darker than store bought honey (the darker the better), the taste is quite different, as well as a more natural texture.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a healthy honey without the pieces of stuff in it I highly recommend this honey!!!!!

review/summary: Perfect bottle & nice flavor
review/text: I love this honey mainly for the packaging.  The bottle is super easy to use -it doesn't leak & the material is easier to squeeze compared to other containers.  You can even use the suction from squeezing it to pull the last drip of honey back into the nozzle. Perfect for keeping your bottle from getting sticky with unwanted/unseen drips.<br /><br />The taste is nice -It's perfect in my hot tea and it's also good plainly spread on toast.<br /><br />I see another commenter complained that they had a problem with it crystallizing, but the bottle description explains that this may happen due to the raw & unfiltered nature of the honey. The bottle also tells how you can easily reliquify by heating in a warm water bath.<br /><br />I highly recommend this honey!

review/text: I first tried this honey in a small mom and pop diner in Montrose Colorado. I came away from that diner with 2 bottles. That was 1996. I've been buying this honey long distance ever since. It does not have the after taste of regular honey, tastes richer, thicker, etc. etc. Only honey I will buy. Except for the HIGH Altitude Honey this company also sells. It is absolutely the most flavorful honey in the world, although more expensive. But worth every penny.

review/summary: Best Honey I've Ever Had
review/text: I read the previous reviews and was pretty shocked at the great feedback people had for this honey. After going out on a limb and ordering this I decided to try it myself.<br /><br />First - the packaging. The plastic bottle itself is a bit cumbersome - sometimes I have give it an iron grip squeeze in order to get the honey out. It does really give off that "hometown raw" aesthetic though.<br /><br />Second - the consistency & color. My wife and I prefer raw honey and have tried various other brands (whole foods, farmers markets) and usually the consistency of the other brands is an extremely thick goo, which you have to spoon out. What's refreshing about this honey is how smooth it is. Another thing with the other brands of raw honey is the color. The other brands I've tried have a dark amber color (resembles apple butter almost), however, this honey although slightly darker than regular grocery store bought honey, it still has a fairly normal color. My guess for the lighter color is attributed to the raw purity of this kind of honey.<br /><br />Third - and lastly the taste. This is the primary reason why I give this honey five stars. Although as I mentioned the packaging is a bit cumbersome, I'd eat this honey if it came in a bowling ball. Well, maybe not, but you get the point. The taste is what matters. This honey is hands down the tastiest honey I've ever had in my entire life. It's sweet but not overbearing and no bitter aftertaste like other honeys I've tried. You MUST try this honey at least once in your life. It's refreshing to know that I no longer need to look anymore for great honey - I'm a customer for life.

review/text: I grew up on the Western Slope of Colorado and know exactly where this honey comes from since my mom used to take me to the fields to get honey comb when I was a kid. For me, it not only brings back fond memories, but I am so happy to have great honey again! I live in AZ now and the honey not only tastes funky but it sugars very quickly. Since the only sweetener I use is honey I am particular about the flavor; not only that, but this even smells like the flowers from whose nectar it is made. I've got it on subscription which makes it ridiculously inexpensive.

review/summary: Fantastic flavor, great value
review/text: On the strength of the reviews for this, I decided to give Ambrosia Honey a shot. It's a gamble buying honey, having never tasted it.<br /><br />Luckily, this honey exceeded my expectations. I normally buy locally-produced honey at twice the cost. The depth of flavor is much better with this honey. It's hard to describe, but the flavor is both complex and light. If you're used to cheap grocery store honey, Ambrosia Honey will be a real treat.<br /><br />The price for this 4-pack is what pushes this honey to five-stars. It's an incredible value, considering what good honey costs.<br /><br />The dispensers are well sealed, and it would be difficult, if not impossible, for these to leak in transit.

review/summary: Ambrosia 16-Ounce Bottles
review/text: Quick Look:<br />Pros: 1) Packaged well 2) Light sweet flavor<br />cons: 1) plastic bottle is very light material 2) Looks filtered 3) Quantity advertised is misleading<br /><br />We received the Ambrosia Pure Honey today. It came in a package with several items ordered and all four 10 oz bottles came wrapped together in a sealed plastic bag with bubble wrap inside the bag protecting the containers. The containers are very light duty. So much so that I thought I would break the container just twisting the cover off to get the foil protection removed. The honey came in the same large box from Amazon with metal tools I ordered so it might have been nice if the bag of honey bottles had been dropped into a separate small box as well.<br /><br />We immediately opened a bottle for a taste test.  It has a very, very light honey flavor and color to it that is pleasant and very sweet. Though it says it is unfiltered it does look like it has been filtered to some degree. It is a little lighter than the picture displayed as well.<br /><br />Most of the honey producers we deal with list their honey in fluid ounces or in pounds.  I was unfamiliar with this supplier but was intrigued by the area it comes from so, I bit without asking about the true weight.  The conversion to weight makes a big difference in pricing.  This advertiser states 16-Ounce Bottles. Well, each bottle is about 10 fluid ounces not 16 ounces as you might be led to believe.  So if you thought it was 16 fluid ounces of honey and you just got 4 lbs of honey you just paid a premium for your honey because 4 bottles or 64 fluid ounces of honey should be 6 lbs. The advertisement should state 4 lbs. of honey. "16-Ounce Bottles" is misleading and maybe done so on purpose. If it doesn't say pint, quart or, pounds I guess the question needs to be asked up front about what we are buying. It makes one appreciate the Dutch Gold Company with their "Bulk Orange Blossom Honey - 5 lb."  No mistake here and they have great packaging.<br /><br />Bottom Line :(  I paid $4.39/lb verses $2.92/lb as I expected for this product due to the weight difference. Generally I try to keep the price to $3/lb and have received a good value from "honeydabber" on Ebay though the product comes in thermally sealed bags for that price. Dutch Gold Company through Amazon is straight forward about their weight as well but the product is pasteurized and filtered.  In the end Ambrosia was only an average product and gets only an average review.

review/summary: Great Honey That is Packaged in a Not So Great Bottle
review/text: Ambrosia Pure Honey is delicious and, unlike most honey available at the grocery store, this honey is produced in the USA.<br /><br />My only complaint about this honey is that it comes in a bottle that is very inconvenient to use.  The main drawback is that there's nowhere for the honey to come out of the bottle unless you unscrew the whole cap and pour the honey out of the bottle.  If you want to be able to squirt honey out of the bottle's nozzle, you need to make a hole in it yourself.  This is no easy feat because the bottle cap is made of hard plastic that can't really be cut with scissors.  I usually end up pouring this honey into a different bottle in order to be able to use it more easily.

review/text: I love the honey and the price is right, I think.  The bottles are large and come in a 4-pack which I like.  Both my husband and I use honey in our coffee every morning.  When I purchased this honey I was looking for a darker kind than what I can find here in Western North Carolina. True, there are darker honeys available on Amazon, but most I looked at were rather expensive.  My only complaint about this honey is that it's a little messy when pouring because it does not stop cleanly and I usually have to just clamp the top down on it to stop it.  Not a big deal, really.  I just make sure to wipe the bottle off before I store it back in the cabinet.

review/summary: Average flavor, but....
review/text: I try to support anything USA made and especially businesses that are "doing the right thing." IMHO this honey has so special flavor or texture, in fact it crystallizes even when stored unopened. But I like the fact that it supports bee populations in a healthy locale. With the plight of the declining bee as it struggles to survive we need environments such as this to ensure the bee and our agriculture systems survive. So for that reason and since it is raw and unfiltered, I will continue to buy this product. Other honeys you may want to try that are sold on AMZN are Cal's Tupelo raw honey made in GA (incredibly good and smooth), and outside of the US consider Manuka Honey from New Zealand (amazing health benefits) and my very favorite is Bernard Michaud 1000 Flower Honey from the South of France. It is very expensive but truly heavenly and worth the price as a special treat. I use this one solely on toast or pastries or by the spoonful.  At Tropical Traditions I buy their Canadian organic raw and unfiltered honey that in order to be somewhat cost effective, I buy it in a 15# pail that lasts a year. I use honey mainly during the fall and winter for constant tea sweetening (yes. I gain a few pounds) but I rationalize it's healthier than organic sugar and it supports bee farmers.

review/text: We try to buy local honey whenever possible, but our family has moved around a lot in the last year. When we ran out of honey we looked to Amazon. This honey is raw and decently priced, so we gave it a try, but we kind of wish we had not. It is so extremely sweet. If you favor wildflower type honeys, this ambrosia honey is not for you. It is also very acidic, and its flavor takes over any mild teas that it is added to. We prefer honeys to compliment our beverages and toasts, so we will not be purchasing this again. However, if you really love the flavor of honey, you might really like this brand.

review/text: I have already tried before different kinds of honey that I bought from grocery stores but there is no honey that can compare to Ambrosia honey, the taste is so pure, not so sweet,I use it everyday for my smoothie drink and with almost anything. I don't use white sugar anymore as they are made from chemicals. I first purchased this at vitamin shoppe but I found the best price here at Amazon.com. I love...love...love the taste and I am already hooked...try it yourself, you will like it too....

review/summary: OMG WOW!
review/text: When I was a kid I hated honey. Primarily because my mom always bought the stuff in the Bear. It always tasted like plastic too me. Fast forward 15 years and I am living in Colorado. I bought this on a whim one day just to see if there was a difference between the expensive (moderately) and the cheap stuff. All I can say is this is one of the finest tasting things I have ever put in my mouth. With my first container I found myself sneaking spoonfuls of nothing but honey for the first 2 months. Now I am content to add a teaspoon full to my Earl Grey every morning and anytime I have biscuits or need a tiny bit of sweet.<br /><br />Simply amazing! Can't say enough good things about it.<br /><br />Oh oddly enough my tabby likes a little bit now and again as well.

review/summary: GREAT Honey!!!
review/text: What happened?!?!  I just signed on here to get more and it's saying unavailable. NOOOOO!<br />I kept forgetting to pick up honey at the grocery store so one night when I was making my tea and realized I was completely out I turned to amazon.  This was priced close to store honey so I thought I would give it a try.  SO happy I did.  If they ever get it back in stock, this will be the only honey I buy.  I've recommended it to all my family and friends.  Taste is great, high quality, full of flavor.  Bottles could be a little better, but they arrived in perfect condition.  If you love honey, you HAVE to try this!

review/summary: Absolutely delicious honey at such an amazing price!
review/text: I haven't been too terribly pleased with the store bought honey I purchased, so I decided to check out Amazon for a tasty alternative. I purchased this particular honey based on the excellent reviews and terrific price. Sure you have to buy in bulk, but that's well worth it. This is honestly one of the best honeys I've ever tried. I'm thrilled with this purchase!

review/summary: Very Good Honey for a great price
review/text: Much better honey than the stuff that comes in the little bear at the supermarket, and it's very inexpensive! The packaging is a little bit annoying, you have to cut off the tip of the spout but it's such thick plastic you need to use cutters or a very heavy pair of scissors, but it's also sealed with a foil seal which help prevents contamination during shipping.

review/text: You don't need a lot of words to review this honey...it tastes better, is healthier and less expensive than store bought honey.  As usual, Amazon service was great too.<br /><br />(And btw, the containers are fine.  Strong enough and were not leaking a drop when I opened the box)

review/summary: A perfect "5" for honey
review/text: This honey has been consistently a perfect "5" for over a year since we started the automatic deliveries every 3 months. The honey is the color of the picture and not cloudy at all. It has a very nice mild flavor. We use it daily. I gave some as Christmas gifts this year to introduce others to it and they loved it. Since I depleted our supply, I ordered an extra shipment and it was sent immediately. Do yourself a favor: sign up for the auto-ship option to save some $ and time! This honey will not disappoint you! Perfect!

review/summary: Great Taste - Amazing Price
review/text: This honey has an amazing taste and a natural, luxurious texture. Its color is dark and its flavor has a mild cinnamon-like undertone. It does great with my favorite green tea and makes an average slice of bread delectable!<br /><br />The packaging is good as well. It doesn't leak and preserves the honey's freshness for long after opening the bottle. I haven't had to clean the sides of the containers like I used to with commercial honey because these bottles don't drip as much.<br /><br />Another reviewer noted the honey crystallizes, but the company tells you how to avoid and solve the problem directly on the package. I almost hoped the honey would crystallize a bit, I love eating a little spoonful of honey with bits of crystals in it...<br /><br />I live in Colorado but I will continue to order this honey from Amazon, as the local honeys available from my grocers aren't quite as good as Ambrosia's. I recommend this product.

review/summary: Excellent honey in a convenient bottle!
review/text: I use minimum 4 teaspoons of honey everyday and since I had not tried Mountain Honey before I bought this hoping this was it.<br />While I don't know if this is indeed pure Mountain Honey, I can tell you that this is better than the only other brand in the market that I had been using until now.<br /><br />I found both of them to be good quality honey, but this one is better. This one is less processed (which is a good thing) which I detected from the taste and viscosity. It is more viscous and only mildly sweet- just like how real honey should be.<br />I punched the same size hole as the one in the market honey bottle and I had to press hard to squeeze this out of the bottle while market honey would start flowing the moment I tilted. (I accounted for bottle size, weight etc.)<br /><br />Regarding problems with punching holes (mentioned in earlier reviews), I have a small pair of steel scissors that just fits in my palm and it was a cinch to punch a hole with that. Alternatively you can use a thumbtack or a nail.<br />Please don't try to cut the top.<br /><br />Regarding the bottle itself, while I do like the "Punch-your-own-hole" approach and the cap to close the hole securely , I don't like the fact that the entire top doesn't screw tight around the bottle. Some honey can flow out and stick on the sides. But that's neither much honey, nor does it happen often so its not a big problem.<br /><br />This may be slightly expensive than the honey in the market but I think its worth it.

review/summary: Great Honey!
review/text: My honey arrived yesterday with no leakage. The honey tastes great! It doesn't have that acidic aftertaste that the honey at my local supermarket does. The price is very competative as well.
