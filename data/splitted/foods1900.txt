review/summary: Mid-Grade Cat Food Product for a Great Price
review/text: This product has better grade materials used to create it than other "general feed" brands such as Fri$kies, Me0w M!x, Pur1na, etc because they are essentially just a bunch of fillers, this has at least some chicken meal as the main ingredient setting it far above them in quality. At a price of 30 for 40LB its less than a dollar pound, and the cheapest food prices i have seen are around 60 - 75 cents per lb so its a great price considering its quality. You can use this as a filler mixed in with better brands if your cats dont get snobby and refuse to eat the cheaper stuff when better food is in the bowl with it. Diamond makes another version, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OH73FO">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Cats, Active Cat Chicken and Rice Formula, 18 Pound Bag</a>  which is a premium type and much healthier. This mixes well 60/40 with it so i dont spend a fortune and they get very healthy meals. My cats like this just as much as the premium. I have a public wish list of other brands of healthy premium food here on amazon at good prices (around 1.50 - 2.00 lb)if anyone is interested. Hope this helps all your kitties!

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I have 4 cats and was spending an amazing amount of money shopping for them at Petsmarts and Petcos locally. I wish I would have discovered this food earlier. This 40lb bag lasts us nearly 2 months! If you order it new from Amazon you don't even have to worry about the shipping, it's free (and for something that weighs 40lbs that's a good thing!)<br /><br />The ingredients aren't that great but at least it's not Corn or grains as the first ingredient..so it's passable. I mix the dry food with higher quality canned food to give them that extra boost of protein and flavor since my cats tend to get bored of the same food over and over. I find if I mix it with different flavors of canned food they NEVER get tired of it (it can even be a small can, nothing fancy if you can't afford the high quality stuff).<br /><br />The kibble is large in size but I actually prefer it that way..when the cats come in from a long day outside they are ravenous and the large size of the kibble helps them slow down and actually break it apart..I have never seen them throw up a hairball from this food like they used to from other dry foods and that is saying A LOT! I got so used to wet messes on the floor and now there are none! Add in the the wet food from time and time (not daily) and the kibble becomes easier to eat for them. It keeps their teeth very clean in it's pure form though.<br /><br />All in all I have ordered this bag 3 times now this year since I discovered it and it's saved me a lot of money and a lot of time and my cats are not overweight or lacking in any way. No allergies, shiny coats and full of energy..I simply can't find a reason to complain.

review/text: I had been using this cat food for several months.  I had rescued a cat looking awfully skinny and dehydrated and as she began to fatten a little she quickly showed signs of pregnancy.  She gave birth a few weeks late to 6 kittens and I still have them all.  They have been fed nothing but Diamond once weaned and have beautiful coats and are very healthy and bouncy.  So thankful for Diamond.

review/summary: Mostly great food!
review/text: I have a Westie and she is very fussy about her food.  The Instinct products have been the only food that she will consistently eat.  My only negative comment about the duck and turkey dry food is that it is made of larger pellets than the dry chicken formula and for some reason it tends to constipate her.  She has never had any problems with the chicken variety.  I feed her the dry food in the morning and the canned version of chicken or duck at night.  She really enjoys having the freeze-dried chicken and turkey sprinkled over her food.  This is especially helpful to entice her to eat, but it is expensive.

review/summary: Clint kills 'em all
review/text: All successful actors have a role or a film that defines them for the rest of their careers. Tom Cruise has "Risky Business." Robert De Niro has "Taxi Driver." Marlon Brando had a lot of them, including "On the Waterfront," "The Godfather," and "Apocalypse Now." Who can watch Jimmy Stewart and not think of "It's a Wonderful Life"? See what I mean? The list could on and on indefinitely. The lesser known actors, while not as visible to the majority of moviegoers, are critical to the success of Hollywood because they often take supporting roles that make the leads look good. They are recognizable faces to niche film fans, however. Enter Clint Howard, brother of the better known director and actor Ron Howard. Horror movie fans will forever pay homage to Clint--he of the perpetually balding pate, goofy visage, and lumbering gait--for his seminal role of Stanley Coopersmith in the 1982 gorefest "Evilspeak." They will just as likely hold a grudge against him for appearing in Uwe Boll's atrocious "House of the Dead," but that's another story for another time. Clint has appeared in dozens of films, as well as most of the films lensed by his brother, but "Evilspeak" is his defining moment.<br /><br />"Evilspeak" opens in the distant past by showing a group of Spaniards excommunicating Esteban (Richard Moll) and his followers from the Church for blasphemous activities. What sorts of activities? The movie doesn't spend much time explaining what these folks are doing, but we do see Esteban performing some sort of bizarre ritual on the beach immediately before sacrificing a young lady to his dark deities. Flash forward to the present--meaning 1981 or 1982--to a soccer game at the West Andover Military Academy. Stanley Coopersmith (Howard) trips at a critical moment and loses the game for the team. The abuse heaped upon this poor lad is extreme. Coach (Claude Earl Jones) initially sticks up for Coopersmith by telling his teammates that every boy at the academy gets a shot at playing for the school. Within seconds of this exclamation, the coach helpfully makes a "suggestion" to Bubba (Don Stark) and his pals that if an injury sidelined Stanley, there wouldn't be much anyone could do about it. Wow, what a bunch of jerks! This is only the beginning, however, as we soon learn that the entire school seems to have it in for this poor kid. Colonel Kincaid (Charles Tyner), the commandant of the academy, can't stand him either. Neither can Reverend Jameson (Joseph Cortese) or the alcoholic caretaker Sarge (R.G. Armstrong).<br /><br />Things start to look up for Coopersmith when he discovers a labyrinth of corridors underneath the school. Wouldn't you just know it? It turns out that the academy sits on the very site where Esteban and his followers established a church devoted to Satan. Stanley's discovery is in actuality Esteban's old haunt. Our hero finds a book written in Latin containing many conjurations and dark prayers, and it isn't too long before he's entering all of this stuff into his computer in an effort to discover what it means. Meanwhile, the torment continues. Bubba and his fellow goons destroy Stanley's class project, and physically assault him in the corridors every chance they get. Kincaid administers a whipping, and Jameson can barely look at the boy without cringing. Coopersmith's dark discoveries soon take on a vengeful tone as he begins actively collecting the necessary materials to cast a spell against his tormenters. The final straw occurs when Bubba and his friends perform an act so despicable against the only thing Coopersmith cares about in the entire world. From this point forward the gloves are off as "Evilspeak" turns into an unmitigated gorefest of epic proportions. Note to self: never pick on anyone again. EVER.<br /><br />"Evilspeak" never lets us forget that Clint Howard is the star of the film. The camera rarely leaves him, which is a good thing because we see what a fine actor he is. Howard gives his put upon character great depth, makes us believe totally that he's a rather inept kid with a penchant for clumsiness yet deep inside is a good guy just looking to improve his lot in life. Stanley Coopersmith is so harassed that you can't help but root for him. Perhaps I should compliment the other actors at this point as well because they come across as the most unlikable bunch of cretins in B movie history, and that is exactly what the script called for them to do. I cheered at the end as Coopersmith took gory revenge against his oppressors. Speaking of the gore, "Evilspeak" contains several scenes of carnage and general mayhem rarely witnessed in American horror films. The pigs paying a visit to the secretary at her home should win some sort of award, but the real gooey stuff appears at the end. Imagine an airborne Clint Howard in devilish makeup slicing through heads and limbs with an enormous sword. Yep, it's gory, it's gluey, and it's great.<br /><br />A huge thanks goes out to Anchor Bay for releasing such a fine DVD version of the film. Extras include a commentary with Howard and director Eric Weston, poster stills, and a trailer. The commentary is a lot of fun due to Clint Howard's observations. He tells lots of great stories, including one about some problems he encountered with law enforcement when he wore his military uniform from the film to a Las Vegas casino several years later. Clint seems like a great guy and his enthusiasm for the film appears genuine. Weston and Howard even discuss the idea of making a sequel! It probably won't happen, but if it matches this film in the gore department I'll be the first one in line to see it.

review/summary: Clint Howard dances with the devil...
review/text: Evilspeak (1982), written and directed by Eric Weston, features Ron Howard's lesser known, but more prolific brother Clint Howard (both started out on the classic television series The Andy Griffith Show, as Opie and Leon, respectively).  During the 70's, both brothers starred in a spate of schlocky B movies like Eat My Dust! (1976) and Grand Theft Auto (1977), (most likely due to the fact that they probably had great difficulty in breaking out of the roles they played as children) to name a couple, and while brother Ron used the opportunity to get into directing (he directed the latter of the two films mentioned), his brother Clint seemed content to keep working in front of the cameras, enjoying his status of forever the character actor dwelling on the Hollywood fringe, managing to develop a long, successful career out of it, even making supporting appearances in some of his brothers films (ahhh, sweet nepotism), like Far and Away (1992), Apollo 13 (1995), and Edtv (1999), but his destiny seems to lie in the world of the B movie, and it seems to fit him perfectly.<br /><br />In this film, Clint plays Stanley Coopersmith, a cadet at a military school.  Stanley possesses an above average IQ, is odd looking, an orphan, a loner, and is highly uncoordinated (his fumbling of the ball during the school's soccer matches leads to much angering of the other players along with the coach).  All of these things add up to incessant picking on by a popular clique led by Bubba (played by Don Stark, whom I recognized but couldn't place until I read that he currently appears on the TV show That 70's Show as the goofy neighbor Bob Pinciotti...man, he's really changed, and not for the better).  They harass Stanley constantly, playing all sorts of pranks on him and just making his life miserable.  Stanley is also harassed by others, like his soccer coach, the school's commandant, and even the school's priest, to some degree.  What's a nerd to do?  Well, the answer comes one day while Stanley is cleaning the basement of the school's church as punishment, which happens to have some secret catacombs as the current church sits atop a much older church erected by people cast out of their homeland so many hundreds of years ago and left on the shores of America for their heresy in following religions darker path.  Stanley finds a secret room, which contains many things, including a dark tome, spelling out rituals of evil and instructions on performing black mass.  With the help of an Apple computer borrowed from the school's library, Stanley intends on calling up dark powers to aid him in dealing with his tormentors, but will he get more than he bargained for?  You bet he will...<br /><br />Clint is always fun to watch, and he doesn't disappoint here.  Turning to the dark side to gain supernatural powers to use against my enemies wouldn't have been my first choice, but to each his own.  The story itself is pretty solid, despite various plot holes, and moves along at a steady pace, keeping the viewer's interest throughout until the film's end.  There is a pretty good heaping of gore and nastiness, specifically near the end of the film, along with a couple of scenes with nekkid women (the scene with the secretary taking a shower seemed a bit odd, as she appeared to have a problem with one of her milk glands, as if it was partially deflated somehow, but I digress).  One thing I found interesting was the level of revenge exacted on Stanley's tormentors seemed proportional to the amount of harassment they inflicted on him.  Decapitations, death by possessed pig, removal of vital organs, etc., it's here and more.  Clint is backed up by a rich supporting cast, including veteran film and television actors R.G. Armstrong (Race with the Devil), Joseph Cortese (American History X), Claude Earl Jones (Used Cars), Heywood Nelson (Dwayne from the TV show What's Happening!), and Charles Tyner (The Outlaw Josey Wales).  Probably the element that will put people off most is the exceptionally cheap looking animated graphics supposed to simulate on screen computer graphics, but I found it kind of charming, in its' own cheesy way.  The film's not really scary, but it does get pretty graphic, and those with a weak stomach would probably do well to avoid this film.<br /><br />This release from Anchor Bay Entertainment boasts a restored and uncut version of the film, which means some of the more gory and graphic scenes of bloody carnage removed due to the MPAA's (Motion Picture Association of America) ever changing archaic rules and regulations (this is the group that gave the film Midnight Cowboy, which later won the Oscar for best picture, an unnecessary X rating at the time of its' release) have been put back in...this is one of my favorite aspects about the DVD format, being the opportunity to see movies as they were originally intended to be seen, before they were hacked up in an effort to satisfy some pain in the rear censorship board.  The special features contained on this release include a good-looking wide screen format (some scratches are present), an entertaining audio commentary by writer/producer/director Eric Weston, a production cast member named Warren Lewis, and star Clint Howard, a original theatrical trailer, biographies, a photo gallery, and booklet insert with liner notes.  If I learned anything from this film, it's that it's not unusual for a military academy to keep a stall of pigs on premises.  It certainly serves a purpose as you can have your underachieving cadets clean the pen as a form of punishment, allowing for a less than surefooted victim to slip and fall into all sorts of nastiness...pig guano...ewwwww...overall, this is a three star film with an extra star for the special features.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />PS...look for Richard Moll, Bull on TV's Night Court, as Father Esteban...

review/text: As one of the few who caught this on cable in the early 1980s, I can attest to the very disturbing nature of this film.  'Evilspeak' as a title doesn't have anything to do with the film itself, but that's fine.  It is one of those rare horror gems that wrings every cent of value from its limited budget.<p>Clint Howard is a downtrodden military school cadet who no one likes - he is beaten up by his fellow classmates, smacked around by his teachers, and beaten by the school chaplain (!). In despair, Clint conjures a long-dead devil through an Apple II computer.  (Yep, it turns out the Steve Jobs is evil incarnate after all!)  Who knew that Satan's minions could be called with an old Apple II with a dual-floppy drive?  Wouldn't it be easier to just call collect?<p>An explosive and gory revenge-fest follows....with explosions, swords, and wild pigs.  Pigs were great in 'Hannibal', but this movie did it first.<p>Clint Howard's only problem is the inevitable comparisons to Ron Howard.  But Clint is a fine genre actor and he brings some fine moments to this 'B' flick.  But be warned, this movie is disturbing and extremely violent.  <p>Recommended.

review/summary: "Remember the Little Kid You Used to Pick On? Well, He's a Big Boy Now!"
review/text: 1981's EVILSPEAK is the story of Coopersmith (Clint Howard, brother of acclaimed director Ron Howard), a nerdy student in a military academy who suffers relentless harassment at the hands of the school's more popular students.  When he inadvertently discovers that the school chapel has been erected atop the former lair of a medieval Satanist, Coopersmith invokes the spirit of the deceased devil-worshipper and enlists the ghost's aid in exacting revenge on his tormentors.<br /><br />The underdog-gets-the-upperhand-via-the-supernatural plot of EVILSPEAK is cliche, but Clint Howard's affecting performance and Eric Weston's capable direction elevate the film above its formulaic roots.  Gore fans won't be disappointed, as included in the blood-and-guts scenes are a decapitation, a nail through the forehead, an evisceration, and lots more.  The flick is a bit sparse on the requisite T&A, though skin-seekers should find beautiful Lynn Hancock's shower scene quite enjoyable.  Fans will recognize genre regular R.G. Armstrong--here playing the besotted Sarge--from such genre films as RACE WITH THE DEVIL (1975), CHILDREN OF THE CORN (1984), and the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle PREDATOR (1987), among others.<br /><br />The DVD from Anchor Bay is well worth the price of admission, featuring the uncut, unrated version of EVILSPEAK for the first time in the US.  The digital transfer is very crisp and clean, offered the film in its original 1.77:1 aspect ratio (enhanced for widescreen TVs) with a clear Dolby 2.0 stereo soundtrack.  Extras include a feature commentary with director Eric Weston and star Clint Howard, as well as the original theatrical trailer.

review/text: Despite the silly premise and acting, i can watch this fim over and over...not quite sure why....possibly because there are some good gore effects, gratuitous nudity (in the most ridiculous shower murder scene likely ever filmed) and a great climax. Clint Howard is actually pretty good as Stanley.<br /><br />This film is like a Troma-fied version of DePalma's Carrie.

review/text: I remember seeing this movie when it was out on VHS and loved it. I am very happy that I bought the DVD so I can watch it again and again. I loved this horror flick because it has it's scary moments and redeeming moments all in one movie. I guess everyone feels sorry for the guy being picked on and when it finally comes down to it, they got what they deserved. Take a chance and see this one. I recommend this movie highly to anyone that loves horror flicks from the 80s.

review/summary: Coopersmith And His Devil-Pigs...
review/text: Stanley Coopersmith (Clint Howard) is a young cadet at a military academy. Unfortunately, he's also an orphan and a clod. This combination makes him easy prey for a group of "tough", insufferable idiots, who torture poor Stanley without mercy! Thankfully, Coopersmith discovers an ancient chapel beneath the academy's church building, where a satanist named Esteban (Richard Moll) was buried years earlier. Using modern technology, Stanley conducts a black mass through a computer, which enables Esteban to possess him. That's when the real fun begins! If you've ever been the victim of mindless bullies, this is the movie for you! Behold: a nosey secretary eaten by savage swine! See: a dopey colonel's head popped like a bulging zit! Watch: as craven thugs are exterminated! A preacher's cranium is bolted! Yessiree, EVILSPEAK gets the job done! This is the TRUE revenge of the nerds! A must see / must own classick...

review/summary: RON HOWARD'S BROTHER COMMUNES WITH SATAN ON A MAC!!
review/text: Blood sacrifice!  Decapitations! Marauding satanic pigs! This good fun 80's bloodbath stars Gentle Ben's little buddy as an uber bullied Stanley Coopersmith, Military School Cadet (bullied by , no less, by future 'That 70s Show' star Don Stark, 60lbs lighter).<br /><br />In the basement of the school chapel, after being terrorised by the alcoholic caretaker (wonderfully played by R.G Armstrong) Clint finds relics and the grave of vengeful (is there any other type?) devil worshipper and sorcerer Lorenzo Esteban ('Sword & the Sorcerer and 'Night Court' star Richard Moll).<br /><br />It takes a while, but when Clint explodes out of the church floor and runs amok with a huge sword, Evilspeak provides one of the era's best fun climaxes. Clint (with a haircut like he's stuck his finger in a light socket) flying round the church with a monster sword, chopping heads off, is quite a sight. Such bloody mayhem along with a nasty scene where a nubile female gets eaten by possessed pigs in a bath, got this flick labelled a video nasty in the UK.<br /><br />All quite tame by todays standards-but still entertaining for fans of 80's horror.

review/summary: Nobody messes with us, we're the devils!, the devils!
review/text: Right off the bat the immediate draw of a distorted Clint Howard head has you 100% intrigued. The green face makes you want to say uhhhhhhhh, Clint Howard, uhhhhh in the best Butthead voice you can muster up. Once you get past the awesomeness of the cover, you read the description and decide that you must pull the trigger. For us just knowing the star is Clint Howard was enough to win us over. This guy is a legend in the B community and we always remain in Sid's Hall of Fame. After a mind blowing performance in the 90's classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002T7YNA">Ice Cream Man</a> there is no way Evilspeak wouldn't be another horror masterpiece. And let us tell you....it was pretty good. It was made it 1982 so you get a fresh faced Howard still trying to make the legitimate acting thing happen. We must say he did an amazing job and produced one 5 star movie here.<br /><br />Howard plays an outcasted military cadet named Stanley Coopersmith. He's a complete screw up but a really nice little fellow. Odd yes..but smart as a whip. The poor kid can't go a day without being picked on by "the in crowd" of cadets, who actually looked more like nerdbags then Howard himself. Not sure who casted these bullies, but Sid could have mopped the floor with either one of the four qu**r cats. The fat guy would have been our top choice. Anyway, Clint is on a punishment cleaning duty deep in the schools creepy basement. Here he finds a book written in Latin, and stirs up some black magic. As he becomes more obsessed with his newly found devil merchandise he decides it's time to exact revenge. He gets himself possessed and goes on a head lopping killing spree. Sid has never seen this many decapitations in his life! Certain to earn Clint a Woody Award for his lopping abilities.<br /><br />Evilspeak is a film that would have Mr. Parker running around calling Clint a G** damn Devil! out of fear for what he just witnessed. Outside of the B factor, this movie was seriously awesome. It was actually pretty creepy yet very hilarious all at the same time. A very crucial factor to a top notch B. In an odd way you're almost thrown off by how normal Clint looks compared to his current state. It must have been the full head of hair he was sporting. We've been so used to the horse shoe pattern baldness accentuating his look of pure insanity that has us confused. This by far would have to be his finest work in the true sense of acting. On the other hand Ice Cream Man is still his most cherished accomplishment. Often when interviewed, he will still bring up the power Ice Cream Man had on catapulting his level of B. It took him from a 5 to a 10 in one swift move.

review/summary: Technomantic Justice!
review/text: Beginning among Spanish missionaries, a Sorcerer named Esteban transcends into immortality vowing to return one day to take his vengeance against frightened christian murderers, and so, fade into the present...<br /><br />Stanley Coopersmith is an intelligent, though somewhat awkward cadet who unfortunately has to deal with resentful,  petty brutes seeking to thwart his productive endeavors at every turn. While seeking solace in the chapel, Stanley explores into its darkened bowels, a veritable labyrinth of hidden secrets, finding a ritual chamber deep below, presided over by a portrait of Esteban. While searching through the many fascinating occult items therein, he finds a grimoire, and thus, excited with the opportunity to rid himself of the lower life forms which plague him, he begins his studies.<br /><br />To shed some perspective on the rottenness of these destructive organisms, in a particularly disturbing scene, while enebriated, they find their way down into the Ritual Chamber by following the barks of Stanley's puppy (perhaps a veritable familiar), whom he had taken to care for instead of condemning it to euthanasia; though sadly, by the utter audacity of these humanoid obstacles, eventually sacrifice it through their stuporstitious ignorance and bloodlust. A typical mindless mob mentality.<br /><br />Being framed by such inferior classmates, he nobly takes the blame (a veritable scapegoat), so he has to see the Colonel (tantamount to The Principal), where the book is stolen by a lying, greedy secretary; though only a temporary setback, as she receives what she deserves via demonic hell hogs. An amusing scene quickly transitioning from sensual to bloody.<br /><br />Utilizing the technology afforded him, he sets to translate the arcane text with the help of a computer, but by doing so, unwittingly charges a spell into its very bits and bytes, and thus assumes a life of its own (a pentagram subsequently appears on the screen). Like a Ouija board, he is instructed step by step on how to acquire power to bring Esteban forth from The Pit. He eventually resurrects The Ritual Chamber via this Technomancy (even actually including the infernal machine upon The Altar!), as Esteban slowly begins emerging, in essence, reincarnating as his return. They both eventually achieve their well deserved justice, as each antagonist is punished accordingly when they fully integrate.<br /><br />Among the carnage, one particularly remarkable scene includes a former groundskeeper zombie doing Esteban's / Stanley's dirty work by cardiac evisceration upon the primary instigator. Ironic in the sense that now he becomes literally devoid of such.<br /><br />This film is both a coming of age story as well as a tale of justice and revenge achieved by a misfit who prevails and evolves into a higher state of being.

review/summary: Enjoyable Sci-fi horror shocker!
review/text: Stanley Coopersmith (Clint Howard) is a lonely and misunderstood nerd at a Military school and is constantly picked on everyday by the local bullies. One day he is searching down in the cellar of the chapel and discovers some ancient material on dark magic and uses a personal computer for the powers of evil, he will soon get his revenge with the powers of hell.<br /><br />Entertaining and gory Sci-fi horror thriller that plays as a cross between "War Games" and "The Omen" is a very interesting movie that combines genres together. It does have an original idea about technology and the occult and the acting isn't bad at all, there is R.G. Armstrong from "Children of the Corn" co-stars in it and there are scenes of graphic violence and gore especially all restored in this DVD version which was originally cut out to avoid an "X" rating. It's good bloody and devilish fun for anyone in the tradition of H.P. Lovecraft.<br /><br />This DVD has a very good transfer and nice sound with a few good extras like audio commentary by the writer producer and director and Clint Howard, theatrical trailer and poster-and-still gallery.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Re-Animator", "Halloween III: Season of the Witch", "Event Horizon", "Prince of Darkness", "The Exorcist", "The Omen (1976)", "Videodrome", "Suspiria", "Sleepaway Camp", "Hellraiser 1 2 3 and 4", "Ichi The Killer", "Demons 1 & 2", "Phenomena (a.k.a.

review/summary: ABSOLUTELY  GORIFFIC  !!
review/text: Around the four minute mark of "Evilspeak", I definitely realized this wasn't the tame television version I remember seeing as a teenager. This is the uncut, unrated and more graphic version with plenty of gore. Anchor Bay studios have remastered "Evilspeak" to it's original 1.77:1 aspect ratio with crisp and clean dolby 2.0 sound. The video transfer is really impressive and worth the money if you're a fan of this movie. After discovering a book of the occult, Stanley begins to translate the writings on his computer and he summons a powerful and evil force to help him get his revenge. Stanley's fellow classmates and teachers at the military academy have pushed him around for to long and now they'll pay the ultimate price.<br /><br />This movie does have some slow spots, but horror fans will appreciate the gore and carnage left behind as Stanley exacts his revenge on his tormentors in gruesome fashion. In my opinion, the ending in "Carrie" has nothing on this movie. This movie contains graphic violence, nudity and gore and in my opinion it isn't suitable for children. Evilspeak is a bare bones DVD release but does contain commentary with director Eric Weston and Clint Howard, plus the original theatrical trailer. Clint Howard may not be in the same league as his famous brother Ron Howard as an actor, but he's great when it comes to playing a creepy weirdo.<br /><br />DVD Features:<br />* Widescreen presentation (1.77:1) enhanced for 16 x 9 TVs<br />* Audio commentary with writer, producer, director Eric Weston and star Clint Howard<br />* Theatrical trailer<br />* Poster and still gallery

review/summary: Near and dear to my heart,...
review/text: EvilSpeak, what can I say, I feel like this film was made specifically for me.  It takes place in the 80's.  Its about an out of shape, nerdy, military school cadet who gets picked on mercilessly.  With the help of a cheesy old Apple computer and an ancient demonic tome, he exacts gruesome, bloody revenge on his tormentors.  Wow, this film should be the bible for all nerds who have ever been bullied.  I, myself, was brutally harrassed in school during the early 80's and would have loved to have seen this movie for inspiration.  Unfortunately, it was never available in the video stores near me.  What a treat for it to be finally out on DVD, restored and uncut, with commentary by the great Mr. CLINT HOWARD!!!  Clint Howard is a brilliant and talented actor who is sadly underrated.  His scenes of vengeance are perfect.  I mean twisted spinal columns, flesh-eating pigs, projectiles to the head, decapitations, disembowlings and nekkid women!!  This is the perfect movie for dorks like me to cuddle up to on a Friday night, with an endless supply of soda and snacks.  So for all you hopeless nerds like me, get this DVD, call all your comic book and action figure collecting friends and spend an unlonely weekend for once watching this movie and discussing it over popcorn, potato chips, beef jerky, ice cream and pizza.  By the way, Clint Howard mentions in the commentary that he would be interested in making a sequel to EvilSpeak.  We should write the studios and demand that a sequel be made.  This movie is crying out for a second installment!!!

review/text: I just finished watching this train wreck and I had to warn anyone who's considering buying this to stay far far away. I read every review just like you're doing now, looking for something different and was fooled into thinking this film would be something special. After viewing this I was left disappointed and frustrated. I have one question for all the glowing reviewers...What the hell were you watching??  It's not quality moviemaking! The script was weak, the plot was dragged out way too long, it took 52 minutes before anyone was killed. Factor in a poor musical score and sound transfer, topped off by sub-par to mediocre acting and you have an amatuer film. As far as special effects go, just fast forward to the last 15 minutes for what little this movie this has offer. This movie reminds me of a college student film gone wrong. To put it bluntly, if this film scared you, you're a P@$$Y! If Amazon offered this for free and just charged you shipping, you paid too much. Go check out something else.

review/summary: Great tea, not too minty
review/text: I enjoy a pot of tea, especially during the colder fall and winter months.  I usually make a pot in the evening after dinner and as I have gotten older, it is becoming more and more important that the tea is decaffinated.  With this red tea, I don't have to worry about staying awake all night and the taste is wonderful.  I like red teas but most of the ones I have come across are mixed with things other than mint.  Since I also enjoy mint tea, the combination is a nice alternative for me.  I like the taste a lot -- just ordered another tin of it.<br /><br />The product description touts this for digestive health which is only an added bonus since I am primarily drinking it for the flavor and the lack of caffeine.<br /><br />A wonderful, great-tasting tea which as become a staple in my kitchen.

review/summary: WOW, BUY THIS!!!!!
review/text: I have never cooked tapioca, never in my life.  I have never made a merangue.  But I was tired of paying almost $5 for a small tub of pre-made, store bought tapioca so I thought I would try this because of the reviews from others.<br /><br />I cannot properly explain how this product has changed my life.  Instead of buying the tapioca in the store (the pre-made stuff - tasted okay, or so I thought before I cooked Bob's Red Mill Tapioca from scratch!  At first I wasn't thrilled at having to buy eggs, 2% milk, and vanilla extract in order to make this.  And when I tried to make the meringue that this recipe calls for I messed up the first batch because I tried making it in an old plastic bowl.  So I went online and learned the proper way of making a merangue (since I don't have a metal or glass mixing bowl, I ended up using a 2 quart non-stick pan - it worked great!).  Once I mastered the technique of whipping up the egg whites and making a merangue, I was set!<br /><br />I have made 4 batches of this tapioca so far and just cannot tell you how GREAT it is. So light and fluffy and it is made fresh, out of good, healthy, natural ingredients.  I am absolutely thrilled with this product.  I was so proud of myself learning how to do this that I left a large bowl of it for some friends from church - they love it, too!!!!<br /><br />I ordered this through the "subscribe and save" option.  This lowered the price and I get free shipping!  This makes the cost of tapioca almost free compared to the stuff I bought at the store.  Like I said before, I have made 4 batches of this so far and I seems as though the bag is still as full as when I opened it - this stuff is going to last forever!  I like it so much I am going to order a bunch of this to give as Christmas presents and I can't wait to try variations on the basic recipe.<br /><br />If you like tapioca pudding, I HIGHLY recommend buying this product.  After you make a batch or two is becomes really easy, even if you have no experience cooking like this - like me (I actually enjoy whipping the eggs whites by hand to make the merangue - who knew?!).  Get this product and order it through the 'subscribe and save" option, you can't go wrong!!!

review/text: I've loved tapioca pudding since childhood, and really don't understand folks who turn their noses up to it!  This is the deal I got at Amazon.  It takes $25 to get free shipping.  If I had ordered only 1 case it would have cost $20, with shipping.  I bought 2 cases for $26 total, because of the free shipping!  Granted, that's a bunch of tapioca, but you have to refrigerate or freeze it anyway, so I stuck it in the freezer, safe and sound.  I'll also share a few packs with family & friends, of course.  I searched several grocery stores around town, and could only find that nasty 'minute' tapioca.  Get the real deal.

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill Bapioca
review/text: I used one Bob's Red Mill Tapioca bag and found it to be quite good and fresh.  I tried the Jell-O Cook & Serve Fat Free Tapioca Pudding at a store before decidding NOT to buy the Pack of 24 Boxes, good thing I did try it since it was absolutely awful.  It tasted like some synthetic powder.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill Tapioca is pretty natural and has no bad aftertaste.  Be careful if you drop an open bag of these on the floor since they are like little plastic balls and you will slip, also, if you fear fish eggs, they look like caviar so you might not want them, but they are PLANTS (a root starch - yuca plant.).

review/summary: Playing with Recipe
review/text: 6/28/2012<br /><br />Tapioca pudding is delicious, but the prepared pudding in the stores is expensive and contains many calories.  So I thought it would be easy and economical to make at home.  (I didn't realize how little tapioca you put in each batch, and bought three more of these boxes than I will ever use.)<br /><br />Predictably Bob's Red Mill recipe is excellent, but I don't want the sugar or the salt.  I have made several variations so I'll jump to my latest recipe.<br /><br />I make a double batch using one cup of pearls and six cups of non-fat milk, no water.  Instead of using sugar, I put ten packets of Costco's sucralose sweetener in the main pudding, and four packets in the egg whites (using four eggs with the doubled recipe) before whipping.<br /><br />The main change I made with the latest batch is to put the cup of dry pearls into a coffee grinder, divided in two batches to fit into the grinder (the Krups coffee grinder from Amazon which is great).  I found that despite soaking the pearls even overnight that they were still too firm. After grinding the pearls, I soak them with the sweetener and all the milk overnight.<br /><br />Otherwise, I follow Red Mill's recipe as to the heating and cooling times, and adding the vanilla (one teaspoon).

Sometimes it is difficult to find in the grocery stores, so I was very pleased to find on Amazon.

review/text: Oh my goodness!  I am thrilled to have found these.  I have been using the instant stuff found in grocery stores.  I suspected I was getting an inferior product since 'pearls' were barely visible.  The pre-made variety didn't cut in nutritional value.  So, I went searching for better, more superior tapioca.  Once again, Amazon saved the day (and some dough!).  Bob's Red Mill does a fantastic job in offering high quality natural ingredients.  No shocker they carry tapioca.  The taste is far more delicious and satisfying than the instant junk.  Pricing is very reasonable for a pack of four.  There is the convenience of delivery.  Lastly, there are now pearls in my pudding!  Yay!

review/text: Well, Baked Beans make you do a few things, but they sure keep you regular. They are also a great way to jazz up a meal in minutes. Heinz have almost made them a trade mark, and there are none to rival Heinz's beans, in my opinion. With toast, eggs, meat pies, potatoes and just about any other food, (I have not tried them with ice cream, yet), they are a good boost to protein levels and energy. Heinz simply are the best in this food group.

review/text: I do a lot of shopping in a Fresh and Easy Market that is located nearby. They're a British company and stock a lot of foods from England and other parts of Europe. They're always a little bit different than American foods and I enjoy trying them out. One such latest item is Heinz Beans with Tomato Sauce. Now, you'd think beans would be beans no matter where they're produced but, man, these beans are delicious and well worth the slight extra cost. I guess you'd say they were gourmet beans. The beans themselves are done to perfection and they're drenched in a savory, rich tomato sauce. Real nice flavor! What can I say? These are about the best canned beans I can recall. And nutritionally, beans are an excellent food. They have zero fat, a good protein content and lots of fiber for those of you who worry about regularity. Mostly, I just love beans and these are real good beans!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: 288 Sticks of Gum Provided . . . excellent product
review/text: Just to clear up any confusion, contrary to the previous comment posted at the end of July 2009, there is simply a total of 288 sticks of gum (i.e., equivilant to 144 "cups of coffee") contained in this two-box pack of Jolt Gum.<br /><br />Put another way, there are 12 pieces of gum per blister pack, twelve blister packs per box, and with 2 boxes provided . . . you will end up with a total of 288 pieces of gum. Once again, it takes two (2) pieces of gum to equal one (1) "cup of coffee"; thus, this purchase is equivalent to 144 cups of coffee.<br /><br />Amazon's price is very good considering you may purchase it directly from joltgum . com for seventeen dollars per SINGLE box.<br /><br />The only thing I'd like to point out is that the precise content of caffeine in each stick of gum is 40mg.  Thus, each two-stick serving which they call the equivalent of "one cup of coffee" is really equal to only 80mg of caffeine.  Yes, I do realize that the reason they don't fully disclose the caffeine content, unless you really dig that is, is because they also have Ginseng & Guarana in the gum which they claim is makes up the "energy equivalent" between the caffeine contained in the gum and the typical caffeine-only value of a typical coffee.<br /><br />Just to put it in comparison, a typical shot of espresso (44-60 mL [1.5-2 U.S. fl oz]) contains 100mg of caffeine.<br /><br />Regardless of my slight issue with the somewhat lack of transparency on the product's labeling regarding caffeine content, I still would HIGHLY recommend this gum!!

review/summary: Safety
review/text: I generally don't take caffeine, but I do try to always keep a pack or two of Jolt gum in my car for safety when I find myself nodding off or getting very sleepy. Safety first; I've learned to trade dogma for pragma at that point. The gum is not made by Jolt itself, it's a licensing gimmick. But, the gum is darn good, too! Good quality gum base and flavor. I do prefer the spearmint. Easier and (in the long run) cheaper than carrying Starbucks jars/cans in your car. You can control the dosing easily.<br /><br />For me (I'm fairly sensitive to caffeine), one will work quickly to wake me up (having something in your mouth helps in its own right). I'm talking almost immediately, somehow. Faster than coffee, in my opinion. However, it doesn't last long. More will last longer--or just space them out. My experience is after about 15 minutes on just 1, it's back to normal. That's probably due to the low dose of 1 gum, and the fact that I suspect the caffeine is in the candy shell, not the actual gum base, so it's dumped into you all at once, and metabolizes all at once too. If there is any downside, that's it. A cup of coffee, you can take your time and drink, so it's more, and rolls off slower (but comes on slower, too).<br /><br />Then again, there's less fiddling with these foil-wrapped pieces of gum, and I prefer that. The package is designed so you can easily pull out the foil pack from the cardboard sleeve, and pop one out. Keeps everything clean and fresh, but still safely accessible. I chewed one in fact today on the way home from work with only 3 hours' sleep the night before (and I should be sleeping instead of writing this review).<br /><br />I bought my first packs at Fry's Electronics. They had the very retail boxes Amazon sells sitting on their checkout counters. So what Amazon is selling is a retail box package--two of them. 24 packs of however many are in a foil pack, and it's a fair amount. If you were to buy the same amount of packages retail at Fry's, it would cost about 50% more than what you pay here at Amazon. But that's a LOT of caffeine gum. So, if you can't find single packs where you are, choose that flavor carefully! I think you can't go wrong with the spearmint flavor--no surprises with the quality or flavor (except pleasant ones). Even knowing I like it, I balk at buying this much. Be prepared to give packs out as stocking stuffers and favors! What I can say from experience, though, is that the gum stays fresh for long periods of time, even in a hot car. I use mine extremely slowly, so I know. The cardboard sleeve and foil blister pack keep light an ambient air out. You'd think they'd done that on purpose! Very lightweight and doesn't take up much room, unlike cans of coffee.<br /><br />I however am browsing Amazon for what other solid-form small caffeine dosages I can keep in the car. There are Penguin mints, but they are sugar-free, and you have to mess with the tin, and then they all can fall out. And you have to take 3 instead of 2 Jolt gums, to equal 1 cup of coffee. The upside is you can suck on them and spread the dose out. Jolt "Mints" don't seem to be made currently, or few e-merchants have them in stock. I also found "Foosh" mints and the amusingly-named "Stay Alert Military Caffeine Energy Gum" here on Amazon. I knew a guy in Special Forces, and caffeine wasn't really what they were given to stay awake on long missions, lol. That "military gum" must be for some 'other' (unnamed, of course) branch, I'm sure, yes. I'm avoiding the chocolate covered espresso beans for now, as the few I've tried never did anything for me (though they are tasty), and I worry about the chocolate or beans melting or going bad in my car. May work for you. Keep in mind you can get little bottles and cans of Starbucks just about any grocery or quickie mart store--which store well and taste good, if pricey. Those can keep you going till you (or I) make up your mind :) . I can't find "Water Joe" on Amazon, which is (or was?) caffeinated spring water. They sell "Avitae" water, but that has just 45mg per container--very low, plus will make you need to pee for how much you'd need. You can also easily purchase caffeine capsules from supplement e-tailers, for instance vitacost. That is probably the cheapest route overall, but will take longer to take effect. You'll find from reviews that nothing is quicker-acting than cafeeine gum.<br /><br />In the end, I'll probably go with this gum, because it works so quickly and is so immediately easy, and the gum chewing itself can help keep me awake when the caffeine fades, but I'm still searching for something even better. Drive safely, whatever you do (advice to myself as much as anyone else).

I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FTVEA6">Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum, Icy Mint, 12-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V2NBLW">Jolt Mints</a>.<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Does the trick, tastes good
review/text: I've turned to caffeine gums so I can drink less diet soda.  Not too many choices and the price is right on this product.  The local drugstore carried it for a short while and now I get it quickly from Amazon.<br /><br />One problem, don't try it after it's been in a hot car all day.  It will NOT hold together like gum and disintegrates into a mushy mess in your mouth and will dissolve into a bitter liquid until you spit it out.  It was really gross, the heat just breaks it down.

review/summary: 2nd Purchase, Great Stuff
review/text: Because I am in class 8-10 hours a day, and I don't drink coffee, this gum is perfect.  Not only does the caffeine help to keep me from dozing off, it actually tastes really good.  The price is great, and with Subscribe and Save, I saved a few dollars more.  The flavor lasts long enough to where I don't feel like spitting it out in the middle of class.  Generally I chew it for an hour or so (the flavor is gone by then, but even the chewing motion helps to keep me awake).

review/text: Energy gum? What kind of sick stuff is that?<br /><br />Wonderfully sick stuff!<br /><br />If you're such an java fiend that you can't get at your morning coffe fast enough, Jolt Gum cuts out all that time-wasting brewing and stirring and gets you right to the jolt you need. If you need caffeine to wake up enough to make the coffee, it's the perfect solution. It tastes just like normal spearmint gum, but it isn't so be careful.

review/summary: Replacement for nicotine gum.  Perfect!
review/text: I quit smoking ten years ago but became addicted to nicotine gum.  So a replacement for nicotine gum was required.  I got over the need for nicotine but still needed a gum or mint.  Most gum seemed cloyingly sweet, so I tried Jolt spearmint.  Perfect.  It's a good quality gum, isn't overly sweet, has some "punch" from the caffeine but not so much as to make me feel jittery.  Perfect until - - - our grocery store quit selling it.  Thank goodness Amazon carries it with free shipping!  Perfect!

review/summary: More caffeine please
review/text: So, I agree with the criticism that the description isn't 'great' - but others have clarified it - each box has 12 packs - each pack has 12 pieces of gum - since there are two boxes you get 2x12x12 or 288 pieces of gum in all.<br /><br />They taste good - just like regular gum. No hint of caffeine bitterness.<br /><br />I do think that they could have MORE caffeine to be more effective - perhaps 50mg (or 55-60mg) per piece (instead of 40mg ) ... are you listening Jolt ??? However, a good product at a good price with a good twist :)<br /><br />UPDATE:  good good stuff... caffeine helps wake you up, keep you awake when driving, helps weight loss, cuts appetite, gives extra strength when going in the gym.  AND, helps you drink LESS coffee.  I suppose if you have HBP you should avoid it, but, if you don't I love it.

review/summary: Jolt Gum Rocks!
review/text: Wow, is this stuff good! A friend gave me some to try a couple of weeks ago and I totally fell in love with it. I'm not a gum chewer typically but I'm convinced that gum is the perfect caffeine delivery system. It's the perfect way to get an energy boost when you need one without having to down a cup of coffee or a soda. I always felt that filling up by drinking something worked against feeling awake and energized so gum is perfect for me. And it's so convenient to pop a couple of pieces of gum in a meeting that's dragging on without being obvious that you need something to help you pay attention!<br /><br />I haven't seen Jolt gum in stores but you can order it here on Amazon or from the company's website so it's easy to get. I've tried both flavors and they're both good. Spearmint is my favorite but the other one is good too, and I normally only like spearmint and wintergreen. I've been giving pieces out to friends at work like I'm some kind of pusher but I swear, everyone who's tried it likes it. Jolt Gum rocks!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G8W7YC">Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum, Spearmint, 12-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G8W7SI">Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum, Icy Mint, 12-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>

review/text: I'm not a coffee guy or a fan or energy drinks. So, Jolt gum is perfect for me. I'm a long distance runner and workout 4 - 6 day a week. When I'm feeling tired after work, 2 pieces of Jolt gum get me going with out any type of 'rush' or after effects. It's also great on long drives, or at work, when I start to get that 'run down' feeling.' I am very happy with the product, its price and quick delivery to my home.

review/summary: You should buy this gum
review/text: Thanks to Bloom for tracking down the 40 mg caffeine per piece!<br /><br />I need my morning caffeine, but coffee upsets my stomach and tea requires drinking too much volume.  So I wanted to try energy gum, did a little market survey of energy gums and picked this one based on low cost.  As an added bonus, it tastes fairly good.<br /><br />After completely making the switch away from coffee, I've discovered an added benefit.  Once you get calibrated as to how many pieces of gum you need every morning, it takes only ten seconds to pop them in your mouth and go about your morning routine while you chew.  This made me realize how much time I wasted every morning preparing and drinking coffee or tea.  After fifteen minutes of chewing, the gum is done and you can spit it out.<br /><br />I got an Amazon "subscription" so that they send me one shipment (2 boxes with 144 pieces each) per month.  That's very slightly more than I chew, which is perfect.  If energy gum is something that you're going to consume on a daily basis then price becomes important in selecting the brand and vendor.

review/summary: Works... but not as well as energy drinks by any means!
review/text: I must say I'm kinda disappointed in this gum as I was expecting the same energy spurt that the Monster drinks gave me (as it has the same amount of caffeine, allegedly). I tried to chew 4 pieces (2 supposedly gives you the same amount of caffeine as in an energy drink) and that didn't give me near the amount of energy that a monster does. You do feel a little tingle after chewing 4  pieces but it's more like the feeling you get when you eat a candy bar or drink hot chocolate. I'm guessing that the claims for containing the amount of caffeine is true, but my body isn't absorbing it optimally (If I caffeine pill it - generic caffeine pills from walmart - then I get close to the energy drink energy burst)

The gum was most popular at Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan,<br />where nearly 4,100 packs were sold. In fact, combat exchanges accounted for eight of the 10 best-selling<br />locations for Jolt Gum; more than 64,000 packs were sold in war zones in one year. That's still a far cry<br />from sales of the preferred combat zone pick-me-up, Red Bull energy drink, which easily moves more<br />than 30,000 cans at contingency exchanges every week!<br /><br />In war the Tiger never goes away:<br />In the combat zones, our enlisted soldiers live in a state of near-constant arousal with high levels of<br />physical, mental and emotional stress. With an Average Stress Score of 84.61 for a paltry Income of $35,580 living in<br />dangerous conditions with the physical risks and the ever-present threat of death<br />our enlisted soldiers have the dubious 'honour' of having the most stressful job of all.<br /><br />The 'jolt' in "Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum" comes from three sources:<br />Caffeine, Ginseng and Guarana.<br /><br />Panax Ginseng* is an ancient adaptogen from China with a warming effect, and is<br />most commonly used by middle-aged and elderly Chinese, especially in winter, for its warming boost.<br />But Ginseng's main health benefit is as a Qi ~ Vital Energy tonic useful in combatting weakness like<br />fatigue, shortness of breath and a low resistance to infections. Ginseng is also an appetite suppressant, a<br />potent natural stimulant, minus the jittery side effects of caffeine, and it enhances<br />memory and cognitive functions.<br /><br />Guarana is a South American Herb that stimulates<br />the brain with slow-release power (but once Guarana kicks in, it works better than caffeine.).<br />Also Guarana doesn't interfere with the sleep process (it actually gives you<br />a better quality sleep over the long haul). Guarana is also non-addictive, relieves stress and<br />anxiety, and increases concentration. Another benefit of Guarana is that it is a diuretic,<br />which can help alleviate fluid retention.<br /><br />Fact: "Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum" not only tastes better, it is better for you,<br />and believe me, it beats chewing bitter-tasting freeze-dried coffee!<br />Personal experience:<br />Awesome results for the overnight deadlines rush!<br />Sent from 'on-loan-from-God'-<br />second-hand-awesome Macbook:<br />Excuse brevity, spelling and punctuation:<br />iTyped with my Bi%$#y iThumbs!

The documentary had enough scientific evidence to convince me never to use artificial sweeteners.  Donald Rumsfeld - yes that Donald Rumsfeld - was the head of the company that hid the horrifyingly negative studies concerning artificial sweeteners when artificial sweeteners were approved by the FDA.  The FDA officer in charge of the case later went on to work for the law firm used by Donald Rumsfeld's company and the head of the FDA at the time went on to work directly for Donald Rumsfeld's company, I believe.  See the documentary.  It's free.  Just google it and make sure it's the 90 minute version.

review/text: These pickles are like the sour pickles I ate 50 years ago but can no longer find in stores. Everything is now pickled in vinegar and seasoned with dill.  The label on these pickles say they have vinegar in them but they taste like acetic acid which means they are likely "krauted" in brine, the old way. The only negative is that they come in a can and need to be transferred to another container for the refrigerator. Also, a few pickles at the top of the can were a little mushy.  If you like real sour pickles without dill, you will like these.
