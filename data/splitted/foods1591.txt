review/text: First time user of fondant.  Always heard it had no taste and was rather difficult to use.  Not true of this product.  Loved it.  Very glad I ordered the colored fondant though.  Could take a lot of food coloring to get this red otherwise.  Grandson loved his Lightning McQueen cake.

review/text: Let me start by saying I have NEVER used fondant before.  I used this to cut out letters with cookie cutters and place them on a cake.  #1 - It tastes yummy!  It's very sweet and not gross like some of the other fondants I have tasted.  #2 - You put this in the microwave for 30 seconds and you're good to go!  So easy to use, tastes great and highly recommend!

The only thing I didn't like about this fondant was that it was a little more shiny than I like.  I like the satiny look and feel.  My fondant smoother had a tendency to stick to it as I wanted to smooth it.  Otherwise very nice to work with.  Very little breakage as I worked over corners.

review/summary: Hard Candy on a Small Stick - Strong Flavor
review/text: This is a hard candy, mango flavored with a small soft fragile stick all covered in a sticky Chilli coating, there was no description and so I made an assumption, I was wrong, it's not mango, it's candy.  Once I got used to the first piece, I found that it wasn't quite as bad as it originally seemed.<br /><br />It's sweet, sour, sticky and the stick is too small to hold like a lollipop and the stick breaks easily.  It's not quite what I would choose a second time, but then it wasn't an intended purchase, I wanted 'natural mango' this is very far from natural.

review/summary: A loveable upstart of a biscuit
review/text: The "Hobnob" is a Johnny-come-lately member of the upper echelons of the British biscuit market. Introduced only in 1984, this young upstart has nevertheless firmly established itself in the hearts (and mouths!) of the British biscuit-buying public, alongside the more traditional classics like the 300-odd-year old "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VJLARC">Rich Tea</a>" and the 130-year old "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZYB4W">Digestive</a>".  It is sweeter and chewier than many other British biscuits, made from a mix of rolled and jumbo oats, in many ways presenting itself as something of a hybrid between a digestive biscuit and a flapjack. It may seem very dry to anyone brought up with cookies (rather than biscuits) and -- like most British biscuits -- "Hobnobs" are best eaten with a cup of tea.  Needless to say, they make excellent dunking biscuits (although being quite flaky, they have a rather messy tendency to shed oat crumbs into the drink).<br /><br />"Hobnobs" are decidedly more addictive than traditional British biscuits (no doubt due to their sweetness) and there is nothing truer than McVitie's original advertising line for this product: "one nibble and you're nobbled". A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5GL2">multipack</a> may therefore be worth considering, unless, of course, you're dieting, in which case you would do well to avoid them entirely!

review/summary: A biscuit of british delight.
review/text: I had purchased the product based on how frequently it was mentioned in a British novel series I favor.<br /><br />As it is shipped, I was pleasantly surprised to find the Hobnobs to not be crumbly from any rough encounters it had while in transit. It was shipped with a second item, both had been in a single box filled with package cushioning material. This was more than sufficient to keep them from moving around in the box.<br /><br />The biscuits have a flavor that is quite close to honey granola bars, although not quite as dry. It should still be consumed with a side beverage, such as tea or milk.<br /><br />McVities Hobnob Biscuits are available as an Amazon prime item, and shipping was not only free, but arrived in two business days. Several other similar food items have shipping costs that are equal to, or exceed the cost of the biscuits themselves.<br /><br />All and all, a great product at a good price with excellent shipping price and speed. I will definitely purchase again.

review/text: During my high school and college years,McVities product line provided me some real comfort on many a bad day with no Hershey bars on the horizon. Hobnobs have a clean,not-too-sweet flavor and a pleasant crumbliness,rather like an upgraded oatmeal cookie minus the raisins. They are good dunking cookies if you don't mind getting oat crumbs at the bottom of your cup of hot chocolate. A handful of Hobnobs and a glass of milk are a good tide-me-over in that expanse of time between lunch and dinner.

review/summary: Fine dark sippin' rum
review/text: I'm usually not a fan of...um..."adulterated spirits" where the producer has mucked with the natural goodness of the distilled essence by adding spices and other flavorings. But Captain Morgan Black Spiced Rum is an exception in my bar. I wish it was a bit lower proof as the alcohol fumes are a bit distracting (fixed by adding a few cubes of ice), but the vanilla and cassia flavors are well balanced. And, I really like the subtle charred oak undertones similar to a low-end but high-quality bourbon. I'm drinking it straight on ice with a bit of lime, but I expect it will stand up well to mixing with Trader Joe's apple cider as the weather cools a bit more this fall.

Another added bonus would have to be the design of the spray bottle, scent, and the non sticky feel of the spray. A must have for anyone who used flat irons, curl irons, curlers, etc.

review/summary: A salon quality heat protectant at a drug store price!
review/text: I absolutely love this stuff! I've always wanted to try a heat protectant spray over a cream, which has always weighed my hair down and left it feeling greasy. On the recommendation of countless reviews online, I thought I'd give this one a shot (especially since there was a 3 for $10 Tresemme promotion going on at my local drug store). This product performed better than I could have ever possibly imagined!<br /><br />I spray this onto my towel-dried hair before I blow dry it. I only apply it from the middle of the hair downwards and a little bit extra on the ends for added protection. My favorite part is that when the hair is dried, you'd never know that any product was used at all. It's so lightweight and soft! It doesn't leave behind any crunchiness or sticky residue. And my hair absolutely looks so much healthier than it used to.<br /><br />This sprays really evenly and covers well. The bottle lasts a long time since a little product goes a long way. And for less than $4 a bottle, this spray really is a steal. I've been continually shocked by the high quality of Tresemme products at the reasonable prices they're sold for.<br /><br />There's no point in spending more for an equivalent product from a salon brand when this gem works just as well for less than a quarter the price!

I purchased the private reserve because it is a higher quality of meat than the regular cuts and wanted to get him something extra special, but was I in for a surprise. I should have stuck with the cheaper meat.<br /><br />The meat came with extremely large amounts of fat all around. We had cut off a significant amount of fat prior to cooking,and the steak was still fatty once it was cooked. I was very dissapointed and so was he. We were going to call Omaha Steaks to complain, will never buy this brand again. Very unhappy with it. The taste wasn't even something that was worth raving about either. I could have went to the supermarket and bought a prime rib on sale that tasted better than this was, which i have in the past, and didn't spend nearly as much as they charged.

review/summary: First Time
review/text: This was my first experience with Pu-erh Tea, also known as the "champagne of teas." It was fairly easy to steep and produced a dark liquid, even darker than my longest brewed Ceylon tea. I found that steeping for 3 minutes allowed me to get 3 to 4 pots (about 18 oz per pot) of full flavored Pu-erh. It has an excellent earthy taste with a scent that is reminiscent of oak wood and something sweet. I have read some books about tea and watched a couple documentaries that focus on what makes good tea. Some of that literature discusses what characterizes quality Pu-erh tea and this product seems to fit the bill. It's now definitely among my favorite teas, a list that includes Darjeeling and Oolong. The only difficulty I had was breaking apart the cake, which is very hard and held together extremely firmly. I ended up sawing off pieces with a serrated knife - once I got some pieces broken off, some of it would break away and crumble more easily by hand. I expect this cake hardness is common to all Pu-erh teas since the fermentation and cake drying process is the standard for this type of tea.

review/text: I dont take it to lose weight, this is a laxative tea, as all the ones labeled "weight loss tea" .I'm very constipated and taking this tea everyday has helped me very much, with no cramps or other negative effects. It's strong and dont recommend it for ocassional constipation or for losing weight. Warning: when it works you "have" to go.

review/summary: Watch out for this tea
review/text: Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.<br /><br />Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.<br /><br />I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!

review/summary: VERY CREAMY TASTING!
review/text: Nestle Media Crema, I like this Can, the cream looks like a thicker sour cream a little more liquid and curdle, it is use in many Latin American Recipes. It took me for years to figure out why the Custard Flan tasted so good, it is because of a secret ingredient, Nestle Media Crema, just an 8 ounce can, along with the other ingredients and you'll have the best Custard "Flan" my favorite. It is a little pricey here, because of the shipping charges, however, they bring it straight to your front door, you don't have to drive all over Town looking for it ... I just love the Covenience.

review/summary: Very pleased!
review/text: I purchased these little gems last week on a whim, after researching the history of the Abbaye de Flavigny. They have been making these candies since the year 1591! Anise is an acquired taste, I think, akin to a delicate licorice, and those who enjoy it will absolutely love these anise drops. A fact I found quite interesting is that it takes fifteen days to make just one of these candies!<br /><br />Each candy is roughly the size of a medium pearl, with a pleasantly smooth texture. They are not meant to be chewed, (the word "jaw-breaker" comes to mind!) but savored. The taste is exquisite: strong but not overpowering, herbal and sweet. At the heart of each drop is an anise seed, the texture of which contrasts beautifully with the hardness of the candy surrounding it. Very refreshing.<br /><br />I am so glad that I stumbled upon these! They are a real treasure in a world where artificial flavorings and chemical-based sweeteners are the norm. There is something quite special about these Anise Drops from Abbaye de Flavigny.<br /><br />As for the seller, Touch of Europe, I couldn't be happier with their service. My package arrived quickly, (two days before the estimated arrival time!) wrapped safely, and included a hand-signed letter thanking me for my business, which I thought was a nice touch.

review/text: I bought this product after I bought an electric corn dog maker.  I didn't want to bother with making my batter from scratch.<br />I used vegetarian dogs the first time I used this mix and they came out great!  This batter is very thick and only requires you add water to it.  It mixes easily and is very fluffy and coats the dogs well.  It turns a nice golden color.  It has a nice cornmeal flavor but not gritty.  It is also made with all natural ingredients.

They are really tasty both warmed in the microwave for about 15 seconds or straight from the package.<br /><br />While I would purchase this product again, I have to note that the box I received from Amazon a few weeks ago contained one package that had half an oatmeal square in it and one package that had two oatmeal squares in it. Not a deal breaker, but just sayin'.

Take 8 oz of chocolate pieces and melt it ( I do it in my microwave at 50% power-60 sec then 30 more until melted you have to stir between heating times), I use my mixer to combine the ingredients. Combine 1/3 cup heavy cream and 2 tablespoons of honey Or Agave or Maple Syrup and heat the combination until bubbly.(I use my microwave for about 1 to 2 minutes) Mix it in with the melted chocolate and add 2 tablespoons of room temp unsalted butter.  I pour this into a loaf sized pan lined with parchment paper and refrigerate.  Then I cut them into small squares and dip them into bittersweet dipping chocolate.  People don't like these, they LOVE these!<br />Enjoy, Mary

review/text: I think it goes without saying that Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Chips are delicious. While they aren't my go to brand for dark chocolate, as grocery store prices continue to rise, they are an acceptable dark chocolate substitute. I'm not only thrilled that Amazon offers these at a reasonable price (or at least it was reasonable when I bought them), they arrived surrounded by cold packs! It was 100+ degrees outside when these were delivered, but thanks to smart packing these arrived in crisp condition. My only complaint is that one of the cold packs must have leaked or something because there was a strange sticky substance on a few of the bags. It wiped off easily so no harm done, but it was kind of gross. I would order again.

review/text: My biggest concern about these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007SNZ66">Hershey Special Dark Chips 12oz - 6 Unit Pack</a>  was that they would arrive in the heat of the day and I'd recieve slabs of chocolate vice my nicely formed chocolate chips. AS the ad stated they were packed in styrofoam with cold-packs. Well, the cold packs had melted into "cool bags of water" but the purpose was accomplished. They made it to my front door "cool" and intact. Still thinking that this deal was "too good to be true" I expected tiny bags, just at the sale-dated product or out right old chocolate. None of the above was true. I'm glad I ordered lots (too embarassed to say how much).  Let's just say that the price was RIGHT for a bulk, BULK deal!) The chips are tiny morsels of heaven. They are truly dark chocolate without extra-extra fillers and they taste wonderful! It's obviously not european chocolate but I'd say it's phenomenally good and I wouldn't have guessed that anything this good would come from Hershey's. I plan to vacuum seal them in jars to keep them beyond the ample expiration date of May 2013. It's way too hot for baking now but I will be SO ready come this fall. For now, it's frozen mocha drinks with a little extra-chocolate from well placed dark chocolate chips!!  Amazon,you really came through on this deal and packing and deliver were perfect! Just because it's true, I left for a couple months but I'm glad I came back to Prime!

review/summary: Unhealthy Ingredients Missing In Product Description
review/text: Because of the unhealthy ingredients in this product I would have rated this a ZERO, but that wasn't an option.<br /><br />I bought this product thinking it would be of the same caliber as Mariani cherries, which contains "dried cherries and sugar."  I'm not a fan of white sugar, nor do I buy or use it in my home, but at least it's the only other ingredient.<br /><br />After I received my delivery I read the ingredients for this product- "Mariani Berries 'N Cherries, 6-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)", as I have done with everthing food item have purchased over the past 25+ years, and I found the following quite disturbing!<br /><br />In addition to the fruit there are the following ingredients:  1)"Sugar" (who knows what kind. I can only assume it's refinded white sugar, but it's not as bad as the following 3), 2) "High Fructose Corn Syrup" (Nasty stuff this is!), 3) "Corn Syrup" (More nasty stuff and also useless), and 4) "Sucrose" (also known as "Splenda" with the Blueberries, and linked to health problems more than the previous 3 ingredients).<br /><br />ALL 4 of these are unhealthy and should be baned from all foods!<br /><br />I was looking for something natural and healthy. There's 'nothing' natural and healthy about white "Sugar", "High Fructose Corn Syrup", "Corn Syrup", and especially "Sucrose" (better know as "Splenda")<br /><br />There is quite a bit of information available that proves these 4 ingredients are unhealthy.  Search each one, or search "artificial sweeteners", and you will be surprised at the negative effects these have on the health and well being of both humans and animals, despite what the manufacturers claim.<br /><br />If 'all' of the ingredients had been listed in the Amazon product derscription I would NEVER have bought this product!<br /><br />I will NEVER by this product again, nor will I ever buy Mariani "Wild Blueberries" again!  They contain the same 4 NASTY ingredients as the "Berries 'N Cherries" product does!  And they taste awful!  NOTHING like real wild blueberries!<br /><br />Mariani:  You should have left nature alone, not tampered with the taste of fresh fruit, and only added some sunflower oil or Vitamin E.<br /><br />P.S.  I wonder if "High Fructose Corn Syrup", "Corn Syrup", and "Sucrose" are Kosher?

review/text: Even since I brought a bag of dried mango from a Snack store in Chicago, i've been addicted to dried mango. I tried all sort different brand of mango since i don't want to drive 3 hours to Chicago just for dried mango, still i couldn't find the one that was like it. And when i saw a good review for this Mariani brand Philippine Mango (and outside the bag says "BEST TASTING MANGO IN THE WORLD!"), and i thought that must be very good. Well, i was WRONG. It was too sweet, they added 25 grams of sugar in a 4 oz of dried mango, it was too much for me anyway. The slice of mango was a bit too thin, and it wasn't as chewy as i like it. I really don't think this mango is the best taste in the world, because i had some that were way way better than this stuff. Now i have no idea what to do with 11 bags of this, i guess i'll just give them to my friends.

review/text: I thought, wow, bulk Lucky Country Red Licorice, sweet, but alas no, it is a mass produced Americanized version from Lucky Country's new US manufacturing plant.  The recipe is completely different from the Lucky Country Red Licorice (same brand, same name) that is Imported from Australia.  The original recipe has more real licorice despite being a red licorice, and is much softer.  The Made in US version is your typical chewy waxy candy licorice with barely a hint of licorice, just pure sweet.  Shame on Lucky Country for taking a high end sophisticated product and watering it down like every licorice sold in every drug store in the US.  I'm heading back to Target or Trader Joe's for the real thing.

review/text: We really liked this licorice when it was sold in the store. It was the same exact brand, but a different container. We ordered some online when the store didn't carry it anymore. It was a little hard, stale and the flavor was off. Didn't taste the same. Seemed a little pricey as well for the product we received.

review/text: My order arrived on time.  I bought this for friends at work.  It was good, as far as taste, but this time the licorice was a bit harder than usual.  What always got me about Lucky Country Licorice was the soft texture, but this time I was disappointed that it seemed a bit hard.

review/summary: Best Licorice Ever!
review/text: I was given a sample of this licorice from a friend who bought it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  With so many of the standard brands having little flavor, this was an immediate standout.  I have only tried the strawberry flavor, but it has a rich taste, and is a "soft" but still good and chewy licorice.  I love it.  When it wasn't available at Bed Bath, and Beyond, I found it on Amazon, and of course, it is considerably less expensive.  The only downside is that you must buy 12 6 ounce packages at once.  For me, that's not really a problem.

review/text: Lucky Country Licorice, black cherry 16 oz tubs (pack of 4)... This candy is the best I have ever tasted, my last order was my third (3rd), it is realy good and may be habit forming to your tast buds.<br /><br />There are several items to choose from, which can be confusing. The best value is the 4-16oz tubs,4 lbs total vs the 1.5 pound package, they are both the same price. I found this to be wrong, on the part of Amazon to allow this to happen. I did not send the 1.5 lbs bag back, it wasn't worth my time, and I do like the candy...<br /><br />I live in Gainesville FL, not Zoe KY.

The Cherry flavor pops with the first nibble; rich and full.  Now I need to try the other flavors.  Lucky Country is sometimes sold at Walmart (Black only) and used to be found at Costco....but is generally difficult to find.  Amazon has a great selection!

review/text: this candy was ok, but it had a different taste than the one we had previously bought at Costco, even though it was supposed to be the same flavor. But, the one in Costco said "new improved recipe" perhaps this one was the old recipe. I was disapointed. But the quality of the candy was fine. Just not the same as the one I already had. So, this candy is not being eaten any nearly as fast.This candy was a brighter red color, and not as soft. However, this candy did have a stronger strawberry flavor.

Four of the twelve milk cartons LEAKED (presumably during shipment) and made a sodden mess of the interior box and other items that were shipped with this item.  Obviously I had to throw those four cartons away and clean up all the other items.  How frustrating!  As of yet, I've not actually drank the milk, so I am not commenting on the quality of the milk itself, just the packaging.
