review/summary: Good fish, crushed cans
review/text: The fish is wonderful.  Smokey and salty, it hits the same buttons as bacon but it's actually good for you.  The bad news is that three of the cans in the case I received were partially crushed.  The cans were not broken and the contents were OK, but they need to protect them better for shipping.

review/summary: High quality fish, sustainable, but too salty
review/text: This canned mackerel is of very high quality, and it is caught sustainably. Some of the cans were dented, but not broken. The fish was too salty for my taste (>30% daily value for sodium per can !). I will go back to Vital Choice with no salt or Bar Harbor brand if I can find them.

review/summary: 10 out of 10
review/text: If you like kippers you'll love these. Absolutely top notch with a good smoke that is not too much, not too salty, not spicy from the pepper, no heavy pepper flavor, firm texture easy to get out of the can in large pieces for putting on toast etc. Great tasting. Definitely top of the heap. Can was easy opening and since these are larger 6+ ounce cans they are easy to get the fillets out whole if that is important to you. The fillets are packed in the can two wide fillets on top of each other, no little pieces. Even though these are packed in sunflower oil the fillets are not saturated in oil or too soft. Nice firm fillets. Highly recommended. Mine came in a nice single stacked 10 can box as packaged by John West perforated so you can remove part of the box so fits nice on a shelf. This also helped protect the cans from dents during shipping. John West customer service emailed me that this item has 5 year shelf life from date of canning for best flavor. The cans I received are best by dated to Dec 2014 but they won't be around that long! Would make a great long term high protein, high omega-3, lower sodium meat option for preparedness. On a side note, my cat gave the remaining "juice" and bits two paws up...it is really more like juice than oil...good for salads no doubt.

review/summary: Sustainable, Delicious, Healthy
review/text: I discovered this product at a natural grocery while traveling and immediately became obsessed. Not only is it extremely healthy, with nearly 40% protein and the highest Omega 3 content of any fish, but line-caught mackerel is, according to the Marine Stewardship Council, also a sustainable fishery.<br /><br />One of my favorite traveling meals is the John West Mackerel and avocado mashup (and some crackers). Delicious!

review/summary: Remarkable Great Flavor and Rich in EFA Omega 3
review/text: Prompted by the positive feedback left by Di Thomas, I decided to give these a try. What a good strike of luck that was. Up until now I used to buy regularly the "Duck Trap of Maine Co" Wild Mackerel Fillet in a 7oz vacuum refrigerated packs for about double the price of the John West canned Mackerel, well, not anymore, The John West is more flavorful, may be the sunflower oil or the fact that has less than half the sodium found in the Duck Trap of Main product. With a lot less sodium the flavor becomes very rich indeed and at 2.6 Grams of Omega 3's per can it becomes a value proposition for your health as well. Scheduled delivery is the way to go.

review/summary: Tough, quality product
review/text: This was my first filter bag for making nut milk, which I have been using almost daily for a couple of months now.  It strains the milk very well--much better than cheese cloth.  However, I would recommend purchasing the 2 quart bag over the 1 quart for the obvious reason of making larger batches when needed for additional use of the milk as an ingredient or for more people.  Also, the 2 quart bags are MUCH easier to transfer the milk into from a blender.  They are very reusable, and wash in a few seconds.  Very easy cleanup.  This product is saving me tons on what I was spending on purchased/prepared nut milks, and homemade milk has many health benefits over purchased alternatives (e.g. raw, free of preservatives, etc.).  You need one!

review/summary: The Nut Milk Bag That Gets It Right
review/text: This (and maybe Diana Stobo's 2 qt bag - not sure because it's shaped differently) have got it right - no seams along the bottom to pop while you're squeezing pulp, no material that stretches, and a drawstring top, just like it should be.<br /><br />Now if only someone could come out with a nut milk bag that gets *completely clean* in the wash, even after soaking. Oh, well...<br /><br />I will say, though, that this is SMALL. Consider buying her 2 qt one instead if you're starting with more than just a cup or two of pulpy mixture.

review/summary: First Time
review/text: This was my first experience with Pu-erh Tea, also known as the "champagne of teas." It was fairly easy to steep and produced a dark liquid, even darker than my longest brewed Ceylon tea. I found that steeping for 3 minutes allowed me to get 3 to 4 pots (about 18 oz per pot) of full flavored Pu-erh. It has an excellent earthy taste with a scent that is reminiscent of oak wood and something sweet. I have read some books about tea and watched a couple documentaries that focus on what makes good tea. Some of that literature discusses what characterizes quality Pu-erh tea and this product seems to fit the bill. It's now definitely among my favorite teas, a list that includes Darjeeling and Oolong. The only difficulty I had was breaking apart the cake, which is very hard and held together extremely firmly. I ended up sawing off pieces with a serrated knife - once I got some pieces broken off, some of it would break away and crumble more easily by hand. I expect this cake hardness is common to all Pu-erh teas since the fermentation and cake drying process is the standard for this type of tea.

review/text: I've looked around a lot for a decent introduction to this style of tea. Teas Etc's video about how to brew it and flavor description was encouraging and helpful. I felt like I knew what to expect taking that first sip, and it was perfect. Light, mellow, smooth and woody. This is a great tea and now one of my favorites. One 3g tou-cha is perfect for my 32oz teapot. So the entire 3oz bag will last me approximately 28 pots of tea. I am very happy.

review/text: My review is about the variety rather than this vendor, so unless my experience is an oddity or the vendor's seeds differ this may not apply. The American Yard Long is not anything like the common cucumber variety in markets. It is more like a pale,bad cantaloupe or honeydew melon than a cucumber. Looks exactly like a long melon with seeds in the center. Slightly sweet but not sweet enough to make it a palatable melon substitute. Too tender and sweet to pass for a cucumber.

Wonderful on its own, but this is a great dessert coffee as well! Stands up well to the medium Keurig setting and might work on the large setting for those who prefer a little weaker cup.

review/summary: My new fave!
review/text: Have pretty much tried all of the K-cup varieties available since getting our first Keurig machine about a year ago (we now have one in our weekend home as well) and this is my personal favorite - makes a nice bold cup of great-tasting coffee (particularly if you "double brew") that's now my first thing in the morning everyday brew! Might be a bit strong for some but great for those who like their coffee a bit stronger.

review/text: This is simply the best coffee k-cup.  A little known fact about coffee is that the longer it is brewed the more bitter the taste.  To get a mild cup of coffee you should actually use a stronger roast, use less water and add hot water to the completed beverage.  This coffee makes the smoothest and best tasting cup I think I have ever had from a home coffee machine.

review/summary: K-cups are defective
review/text: I have owned a Keurig brewer for over 2 years and have never had a problem with any K-cups. I had previously purchased these K-cups as part of the Subscrible and Save program and had been happy.  The last order I received has been a disaster, either the filter piece is missing from the K-cup or the K-cup is not sealed properly.  Amazon customer service was excellent as usual and replaced the order, but I am having the same problem with the replacement cups.  I know it is not my brewer because I have other K-cups that work just fine.  It is very messy when the coffee grounds either explode all over the place or end up in the cup.  It is extremely aggravating to go through 10+ K-cups to get one cup of coffee.  Again, this is not the fault of Amazon, but rather the manufacturer of these K-cups.  I will be canceling this Subscribe and Save plan.

review/text: I have had a K-cup machine at work for a year or two; and one at home for over a month; I am an addict for strong coffee/ we have a club at work (not k-cup related) and we get PEETS' coffee/ its really bold and rich.<br /><br />I have had most every extra-bold roast for the K-cup machine. In my opinion, the Black tiger is a great tangy bold coffee with enough earthiness too but nicely powerful and flavorful. A great combination. A double dose of this in the travel mug and its heaven. If you are like me and like dark coffee that actually still has flavor... You will really love this one.

review/text: I have only seen one Keurig brewer here in Japan. Don't those little plastic packages generate an awful lot of non-degradable waste? Do we really need more, especially for the sake of saving a few seconds making morning coffee???

review/summary: A favorite
review/text: Bought this for my husband, it's his new favorite. He likes a really dark 11 oz. cup of coffee so I always get Extra Bold varieties for him. Some of his other favorites are Green Mountain's Dark Magic, Timothy's Midnight Magic & Rainforest Espresso.

review/summary: This is it!
review/text: If you like your coffee strong this is the K-Cup for you!  I've tried the 'bold' coffees from various manufacturers here on Amazon and this is the one that wins hands down.  It's strong, it has a kick but the flavor is still smooth and subtle.

review/summary: Coffee People pods are the best
review/text: Black Tiger is my favorite coffee pod. First, it is delicious coffee. Second coffee people pods are the only pods I have seen where you get some crema, or the creamy looking froth that high pressure brewing can get. This is the sign of a well brewed cup and something that drip cannot duplicate. I used to mix up my pods but after trying the Black Tiger I have 4-5 boxes and unused pods that will never be used. The other Coffee People pods also get some crema.

review/summary: Just what I was looking for.
review/text: To begin, disregard the low ratings for this item given by other reviewers. 1: they are not reflective of the coffee as a product, and 2: the issue was obviously a market-wide increase in price as I cannot find any site or retailer that sells them for the prices they claim.<br /><br />As far as the coffee, I am very pleased with it. I can be very picky with my coffee and took a gamble by ordering this specifically instead of a variety pack, luckily I was not disappointed. It tastes distinctly of coffee without being harsh, even when there is plenty of cream and sugar. A common problem I have with stronger coffees is an acidic aftertaste that persists unless I eat something or try to wash it down, but  I have not had any issues with this and I am nearly through my first pack.<br /><br />I can't speak for other blends from Coffee People, but I honestly can't see myself wanting to. Black Tiger is absolutely delicious and just what I like in the morning or when I come home from work. Very satisfied.

review/text: This is definetly a keeper in my pantry.  I tried the Donut Shop and the Black Tiger and by far everyone prefers Black Tiger. Donut Shop tastes, well like a cup of coffee from a Dinner, or McDonalds. But Black Tiger has a strong taste without any of the bitter undertones.

review/summary: Best K-Cup I have tried...
review/text: The Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast is by far the best K-Cup I have tried.  I have had my Keurig brewer for about a year now and I have bounced around from brand to brand sampling the different coffees to find one that really speaks to me.  The Black Tiger may be that coffee.  I like a strong cup of coffee, but I don't want it to be bitter or taste burned.  The Black Tiger has no bitterness or over-roasted taste to it.  It is very smooth and full bodied.  I have also tried the Timothy's Rainforest Espresso and this coffee is far superior in texture, body, flavor, and strength.  I keep 3-4 different types of K-Cups near my brewer and ever since I bought the Black Tiger it is the only coffee I have drank!

review/summary: Not bad, but we like Timothy's Midnight Magic and Green Mtn Dark Magic better!
review/text: Not bad, but we like Timothy's Midnight Magic and Green Mtn Dark Magic better! Please read my review under Timothy's Midnight Magic for in-depth comparison. Overall, not a bad cup, bitter smell, not as bold as the others listed above. In fact, I prefer the Diedrichs French Roast over it as well.<br /><br />#1 Timothy's Midnight Magic  (see review)<br />#2 Green Mtn Dark Magic  (Target)<br />#3 Diedrichs French Roast<br /><br />A lot of people seem to really love the Black Tiger based on the reviews, I have them sitting on the counter, but once my friends try the Midnight Magic from Timothy's, they never try anything else. Just my limited experience. :)

review/text: I have not tried an Extra Bold Coffee that I did not like. Having said that, I find the Coffee Peoples Black Tiger Extra Bold to be very good. I normally drink this product after dinner. The name is a little intimidating but overall a goood cup of coffee. I like strong fresh coffee, however I find my guest like something milder than Bold coffee.

review/summary: Great Everday Stong Coffee
review/text: I enjoy this flavor of coffee everyday at work.  This was the alternative I chose to Dark Magic, which is also a good brew.  Often many coffee flavors tend to taste different over time, usually more acidic than I would care for.  But this is a good rich, dark coffee that you can order for a long time.

review/text: OK, here's the thing, I love my Keurig coffee maker.  Finding a good deal on K-Cups is another issue alltogether.  Coffee People's Black Tiger Bold is a good value and a great cup of coffee for those who like a strong, rich, dark roast.  Thanks, Amazon.  Now, if you would please get rid of shipping charges on coffee orders of $50 or more, I'd order more often.  Anyway, get this coffee.  You'll love it.

review/summary: Excellent, best of the best!
review/text: After being a Starbucks drinker for the past 20 years at least, the Kcup has won me over, especially Green Mountain coffees and blends like Black Tiger.  None of this coffee is ever bitter or acidic like Starbucks.  It's strong but as it's perfectly measured you never get that "put too much coffee or too little water" feeling.  It was interesting to see a CNBC special on Green Mountain, which also makes the Keurig brewers; they said the makers are sold literally at cost and they make their money off of the coffee.  Starbucks is now selling Kcups...for over a buck each!!  I say drop the Star and save some Bucks!

review/text: Coffee People K-Cup Extra Bold Black Tiger Roast is an exceptionally robust, bold flavor without even approaching bittnerness.  And, it avoids the 'greasy' richness of some other brands, which for me at least, can cause a queasy stomach.  This is my favorite!

review/summary: poor packaging
review/text: I received a 25-count box of Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast that had 3 packets with unsealed tops. In fairness, I don't know if this was the result of poor quality control in production or damage during shipping. My order included a box of Gloria Jeans K-cups which did not have opened tops so I suspect that the tops on the Coffee Peoples cups were not glued properly.<br /><br />One day after voicing my concern, I received a replacement. What great service - I'd give them 5 stars now!
