review/text: Another great LaraBar.  My favorite by far is the cherry, but I have not had a bad bar yet.  This is just like eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  A bit more calories than the others, but anything with peanut butter will be.  Still great nutritionally.

review/text: These are the best bars made by Larabar.  They really taste like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and they are not as sweet as the other bars.  I prefer them because I dont feel like I have eaten a candy bar and they keep me full like a sandwich would for hours.  I would highly recommend them to anyone especially gluten free people who need something to travel with or just go shopping and fit in a purse.

review/summary: A PURE "ENERGY" BAR
review/text: If you are into "energy" or "protein" bars, please try the Lara Bars. They contain no more than 6 ingredients such as walnuts, almonds and cashews to provide protein and the "good fats" as well as such fruits as dates, bananas, cherries and apple which give your body the carbohydrates it needs for energy. Compare them to any other bar on the market and you will see how the short list of simple ingredients adds up to great nutrition as well as great taste.

review/text: I first bought Lara bars at a local grocery store, drawn by the idea of a bar that was nothing more than fruits and nuts. No additives. No added sugar. Yum!<br /><br />I was pretty pleased by the taste of my first purchases, and I liked these a lot, too.<br /><br />The taste of these is a bit tart (it's lemon, after all), but sweet at the same time.<br /><br />The texture is very soft, but with the tiny crunch of minced nuts.<br /><br />Excellent!

review/text: Lara Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Cashew Cookie, is the most delicious food bar I have ever tasted.  Besides being so yummy, I love the fact that it's RAW and therefore all the nutrition from the dates and cashews is kept intact.<br /><br />I always keep extra bars in my car or purse so that these tasty bars are always available to satisfy my hunger wherever I go.  One bar will keep me going for one to two hours, which is a blessing when I can't eat a regular meal.

review/summary: My favorite energy bar
review/text: This is my favorite energy bar.  Most of the time I prefer to eat real food, but there are occasions (long hikes, motorcycle trips) when it is more convenient to stash a small energy bar that is not damaged by extreme temperatures or being squished, and does not need anything else for preparation or clean up.  I also will frequently throw one in my purse if I am going somewhere for the day like a fair or expo where I'm not sure if there will be anything to eat besides hot dogs and nachos.  I like that there are not any artificial flavors or colors, no ingredients I cannot pronounce or have to look up in a dictionary, and no preservatives.  This is my favorite flavor, followed closely by the lemon.

review/summary: Not good anymore
review/text: I was a HUGE fan and recommended it highly.  However, I just tossed a whole box.  Something has changed -- and not in a good way.  I had concerns last year and thought maybe the taste was "off" just on the one box.  So I picked up another box last week.  It's even WORSE!  Since General Mills bought LaraBars (Humm Foods) three years ago, the product just seems to have gone down hill.  It doesn't have the same fresh, alive taste; there is a harsh, metallic flavor that indicates whatever machinery produces the bar now is not being properly cleaned.  Also the bar didn't used to be so oily to the touch.  Oily, weird flavors in nut bars make me think the nuts have gone rancid.<br /><br />Since I am writing, I also want to say it has bugged me for years that AMAZON continues to misrepresent the maker of LaraBars in the title of the product "LaraBar" by "LaraBar".  I suppose this is because people who generally buy raw food product are not usually the same people who support multinational food conglomerates like General Mills.  But it just makes me think that Amazon thinks consumers are ignorant.  I feel insulted every time I see it.

review/summary: Some Amazing! Some Not So Amazing...
review/text: It took me a long time to try these larabars out and I don't know what really prompted me to try one finally but I am so glad I did.  From the flavors that I have tried some just blew me away while some really left me feeling unsatisfied in the flavor department.  I will rate the ones out of 5 stars that I have tried, 1 being terrible and 5 being so delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cookie- 5 stars for this one, so delicious!!!  It tasted just like peanut butter cookie dough but made with crunchy peanut butter due to the nuts that are not ground up.  Such amazing texture and taste, it actually is better when left in the sun to warm up.  The flavor comes out so much better and texture too.  This has to be my favorite so far out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Pecan Pie- 5 stars for this one.  I am not a pie person at all, and pecan pie would never be my first choice but after having this larabar I am hooked on its flavor.  It tastes just like pecan pie, no kidding.  It's so strange how such simple ingredients can taste like the real thing.  It has a very deep flavor, almost a caramel molasses flavor.  There are nice pieces of pecans and almonds but not too many to overwhelm the bar itself.<br /><br />Peanut butter and jelly- 4 stars for this one.  It tastes just like that stuff called goober where there is peanut butter and jelly in the same jar.  I grew up eating that stuff and it's so much fun to be able to get that same flavor with this larabar.  I only gave it 4 stars though because it tends to get really tart due to that unsweetened cherries but still really delicious.<br /><br />Apple Pie- 2 stars for this one.  This was such a forgettable flavor, it was too tart in my opinion to taste like apple pie and they were really heavy on the cinnamon.  Don't get me wrong, I know that they are not suppose to really taste like the title says but it still is my least favorite out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Cherry Pie- 3.5 stars for this one.  This actually does taste like cherry pie but does taste like the filling of a cherry pie. I bet if they were to add cashews it would lend more of a buttery crust like taste but maybe not.  While this is a nice change every once in a while it is not one that I would get excited over.  Very tart but I love the ratio of nuts they used.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough- 0 stars, and yes I can give zero stars if I want.  This bar I took a bite out of and was so turned off by the taste.  Way way too sweet due to the chocolate chips used.  I love the larabars because of the no added sugar but by them adding chocolate chips which contain way too much sugar in my opinion really ruined this bar.  If it were not for the chocolate chips I think that it would have been better.  Unsweetened cocoa powder would have been better.  If you like almost candy bars but want a healthier option then you would like this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie- 5 stars for this bar.  This I was worried about trying because I am not really a fan of cashews to begin with but I want to try all of these bars, most of them anyways.  I was so surprised at how scrumptious this bar was.  It was not too sweet at all and the cashews lend such a wonderful almost buttery like flavor.  There is no added salt but I felt as though there was a nice saltiness to this bar.  This is my second most favorite after the peanut butter cookie larabar.  I like this one on days when I do not want any strong flavors and nothing too sweet and this one fits the bill.  I have never had a cashew cookie or heard of them but I can imagine they wouldn't be as good as this bar.<br /><br />I plan to try more so I will update this review soon.

review/summary: Yum, Ginger Snap tastes like gingerbread!
review/text: The Ginger Snap Larabars are great as are many other flavors.  These are a wonderful and healthy on the go snack.  Although the texture is a bit strange at first since they are so soft, you'll get used to it quickly.  These saved my on-the-go breakfast lifestyle after I discovered my gluten and dairy allergies! Definitely recommend this product.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are Ginger Snap, Pecan Pie, Cherry Pie and Apple Pie. Enjoy!

review/summary: banana cookie goodness
review/text: I don't typically like banana flavored stuff. I'm not that crazy about adding bananas in my shakes. But this banana cookie bar is FREAKIN AWESOME. It is so delicious. I share them with friends all the time and the only friend that didn't like it just had a thing about not liking dates (and the ONLY three ingredients in this bar-o-goodness are: almonds, dates, and unsweetened bananas). THANK YOU LARA FOR YOUR DELICIOUSNESS IN A BAR. Just as tasty as it is nutritious ... and THAT is somewhat difficulat to find in "ready to eat" foods.

I couldn't eat one every day, but for an occasional meal replacement, it is very good.  Too high calorie to be a snack item, but it's tempting.

review/text: We really like Lara Bars.  We originally purchased our first ones at Whole Foods, mainly because the ingredients list is very pure and simple.<br /><br />When you eat these bars, don't think fruit first, think nuts then fruit.  Then when you hit the chunk or bit of fruit its a nice suprise.  Don't get us wrong, these are great... but there is a marketing difference in "Banana Cookie" vs. "Banana Nut Bread" for instance.<br /><br />Definately worth picking up, especially at Amazon prices/shipping.

review/text: "Cherry Pie" is certainly a misnomer, even to those not used to traditional sweetness. Yes, the first ingredient in (all) Larabars is dates, and here it's very evident. Certainly a nutritious enough snack, but the cherries and almonds are pretty subtle and the flavor isn't top-notch.<br />Apple Pie is tasty and available on clearance from Target quite often.<br />Chococonut Chew tastes like chocolatey dates, as evidenced by the coconut as the final ingredient and dates as the first. Almonds overpower your mouth and the taste.<br />Cashew Cookie tastes just like a solidified version of my homemade cashew butter; would not invest in such a thing. Overly salty and bland, and a pretty hideous thing, too.<br />Pecan Pie is alright but certainly not a buy-twice.<br />Same w/ PB Cookie, which tasted more of peanuts than anything resembling a PB cookie.<br />PB & J<br />Coconut Cream Pie is atrocious, tasting like coconut oil and absolutely no cream component.

review/summary: not straightforward about allergen information
review/text: My daughter is extremely sensitive to gluten so many products that promote themselves as gluten free prove to be otherwise when my daughter has a gluten reaction.  For the sake of keeping my daughter healthy I contact companies asking them if they test for gluten and if gluten is processed in the same facility.  If it is then it is almost certainly contaminated.  Most companies give me a detailed and open answer so that I can make the best decision for my daughter.  They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not.  They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision.  Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer.  They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing.  They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels.  They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so.  So Larabar is attempting to deceive me.  They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars.  Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful.  I was so turned off by Larabar's response that I want nothing to do with them.  It was obvious they could care less about my daughter's health.  Ultimately, they put their profits above children's health.

review/text: As someone on a low sodium diet I have to make many types of food which most people buy, such as applesauce,bread, ricotta,and granola. I think these bars-and other Larabar flavors- taste 'chemical' to the point that they verge on artificial, despite being haled as all natural.  "Natural" does not equal tasty,and it often means nothing important. Besides tasting better,I wish the sodium levels were more readable - and lower.Sure fat,sugar and protein are all important,but more people die of cardiac disease and hypertension -linked to high sodium in the diet- than from lack of protein.

review/summary: DISGUSTING with a Capital D
review/text: Why put unsweetened ingredients in one of these bars? Unsweetened chocolate? Disgusting. This product lacks flavor and is way too heavy and dense. I also don't know what could be nastier than unsweetened coconut. It needs to be lighter in texture and a lot sweeter (not cloyingly so) and then this might be at least tasty. As it is, it is a waste of money and an absolute disappointment.<br /><br />To the manufacturer: look for inspiration in the flourless chocolate cake sold at Trader Joe specifically for gluten free diets, and check out the flavorful almond horn by Aleia. Both are mildly sweet, but full of flavor.  The chocolate flavor pops in the mouth and makes you forget that it has no gluten in it.  The almond horn delights you with the fragrance before it ever hits your mouth.  Both go great with tea, coffee and fruit, particularly the cake goes well with fresh stawberries.<br /><br />Maybe you just need to stick to a core ingredient and work around it.  There is too much nastiness going on in this disgusting bar.<br /><br />This is a terrible product that cannot be recommended. There are just way too many nasty gluten free products on the market, and this should be placed exactly where I just put it, in the garbage. More $$ down the drain and continued disappointment reigns.<br /><br />I am being brutally honest because I was recently diagnosed with a gluten allergy and have exceedingly fond memories of all of the delicious wheat-based offerings I used to eat and I naturally expect to be able to partake delicious gluten-free substitutes, espcially since they usually cost twice as much as the products containing gluten. This is no substitute for the wheat-based version, to say the least.

review/summary: OMG - The horrors....the horrors.
review/text: Everyone in my family shares my opinion that these things taste absolutely HORRIBLE.  I feel really bad for someone who needs to eat Gluten/Dairy/Soy-free or Vegan/Kosher foods.  If I had to live on these alone (and I don't), I'd convert back to being a non-vegan or whatever.  We all tried the Cherry Pie flavor, and what this thing has to do with cherry pies is way beyond me.  It's a lump of semi-solid goop with some nuts and dried fruits that taste sour and bitter and somewhat sticky.  Simply gross to the point I couldn't even finish one bar.  I may not be a health food nut, but I know what tastes like crap when I taste it...and these things are crap all the way. Steer clear.  Even 1/2 hour after, I still have that horrible taste in my mouth and need to go brush my teeth to get rid of it.

review/summary: "Health" Does Not Always Equal Health
review/text: It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong. I lost it gradually and within recommended weight loss recommendations (1-2 lbs a week). I didn't starve myself, stop my social life for any diet's decrees, and I definitely wasn't under the tutelage of any one diet. I have done that already and realize a few things: 1) you must exercise daily, 2) you must mind calories, 3) you must eat 3 meals and 2 snacks every day, and 4) the types of nutrients matter (omega 3, 6, and 9 fats, thermogenic herbs, antioxidants, etc.)<br /><br />The greatest myth I busted was any form of perfectionism. If you have a candy bar once in a while, that doesn't mean you are a big failure, you have to start all over, and you might as well do that next week (so you can binge in the meantime).<br /><br />All diets are perfectionistic. They focus on one aspect of healthy eating and run with it to fit the lose-weight-overnight / Can-I-also-have-a-pizza-with-all-the-fixings? mentality of the typical deluded American. That's why we have the Atkins diet, illustrating the worst of this concept. However, these diets aren't bad, because you can extract a jewel of knowledge from each of these regimens. Atkins taught us to watch carbs and not to fear protein (although that doesn't mean you can eat bacon); Fat Flush teaches you the difference between good and bad fats, thermogenic herbs (that raise the metabolism), and a very basic understanding of the Glycemic Index, and Thurmond teaches you what combinations of foods work to lose weight and the power of eating many small meals throughout the day.<br /><br />Larabar is another great example of the focused diet. The jewel is the omega fats 3 and 6, gluten-free, no dietary sweeteners (which increase your appetite and studies have correlated artificial sweeteners to weight gain because of its high glycemic index count), and it being all natural, organic, and kosher. That's great, when you focus on only this aspect. But still, however popular diets have become, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and the like can never be ignored. The one irrefutable truth is the calories you take in determine what your weight will be in the immediate future. If there is a high fat percentage, which are calories still, you have to consider that.<br /><br />LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES! These health bars are healthy, but I would only have them as a reward before or after a good workout. This is the first review that I am rating this low because of the padding I suspect going on. One reviewer talks about the low calories, which is totally false. Two reviewers talk about how healthy it is, sounding very close to an infomercial as he focuses on only one aspect but ignores another. The suspicion arises when these two reviewers rate this bar 5 STARS 3-4 FREAKIN' TIMES WITH THE SAME WORDS! They must mention the excessive calories and fat in these bars, or else someone's going to go off of insufficient information and eat one every day with a sedentary lifestyle. Compare this bar to a Snickers, and you may have a different perspective. What is labeled "healthy" can be very bias.<br /><br />MY POINT BEYOND LARABARS: You can't focus on one system of ideas, because health and nutrition and weight loss are much larger and much more demanding concepts of nature's effect on the body. It's how you sustain and develop habits and balance in life, and it's about the knowledge you keep in your head, so you can deftly cut corners through increasing your metabolism or burning the maximum calories. It's about myth busting. It's about making smart choices. It's about knowing what choices are in the first place; if you choose one path, you can't choose another. Sacrifices may be what your particular body requires to be healthy and lose weight. You won't find a real chili-dog diet. You won't find a sugar that tastes exactly like sugar. One path leads to one place, while the other path leads to another. Note the difference, and be realistic.<br /><br />Lastly, the only health change you can make overnight happens in your head, not in your body.

review/text: recently diagnosed with celiac, I've had to restructure my whole vision of food and snacks and how to stay healthy.  I've never had luck with nutrition/meal replacement bars in the past (can we say cardboard?), so I was leery when those on the celiac support boards kept singing the praises of Larabars.<br /><br />I picked up my first one at Whole Foods, and was worried with the high nut content -- I'm not known to be fond of nuts.  but after one bite, I discovered I LOVE nuts -- if they are in a Larabar.  the cherry bars are sweet and sure at the same time, just like fresh cherries.  the dates and nuts balance out the flavor experience.<br /><br />unlike other bars, these are soft and tasty, and beyond filling!  I can usually only nibble half at a time.  but now, I have something to keep in my purse or in my desk at work for emergency food.  everyone else can have a sandwich with their wheat filled bread, and I'm perfectly happy to munch away on my Larabar.

Sometimes simple and natural is better, and this is one of those cases. I far prefer these to any of the fancy energy bars like Luna Bars, Clif Bars, etc. They are simply nuts and dried fruit, they satisfy my sweet tooth and also give me the energy I need to get through the day. I eat them as a mid-morning or mid-afternoon stack. Cherry Pie is by far the tastiest flavor. It is tart and tasty.<br /><br />I'm confused about why these aren't listed in Amazon's Gluten-Free section, though?

review/text: I'm on the go and trying to keep healthy and fit by making sure I eat at regular intervals. I tried the "energy" bars and "nutrition" bars, but they all have fake sweeteners with that nasty aftertaste. Saw the Larabars in the grocery store and picked up a few different flavours to try. WOW!! All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />If you are a big chocolate lover, I would just warn you that these don't taste like a chocolate bar - the combination of cocoa and chili powder is really more like a Mole sauce you get in Mexican cooking - rich, but not at all sweet. And the chili powder is not enough to be hot or spicy.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar.

review/text: Gee:  Something relatively healthy that tastes this good has got to be a crime, no?  The only prob. is that I adore these, but cherries are heavily sprayed...so if you're looking for Organic foods, you're better off with the Think Organic cherry nut bars.  The problem THERE is that I am somewhat allergic to Cashews and the Think Org. bars are loaded with them!  Larabars  use Almonds, which is no problem for allergies, just for chemical sprays.<br /><br />Darn it, guys, why doesn't someone come up with a relatively hypoallergenic product that is also ORGANIC????  When you do, your bars will be my most favored product of the century!!! Otherwise, the Cherry Pie Larabars are unbelievably yummy and raw food, which is always good.

review/summary: Chocolate Coconut
review/text: I cannot say enough about Larabars. Simple ingredients, whole ingredients, and a great snack. However, the one caveat is that the ingredients are not organic and that is why I am providing a 4 star rating. Some foods like Dates with very thin skins I would prefer to have an organic option. I wish that they would offer an organic version of this bar. However, they do taste amazing and are probably one of the best options out there if not the best. These are perfect for me at University for between classes when I am on the go and do not have enough time to go to the cafeteria quite yet.<br /><br />I would recommend trying the flavors before you buy a whole package, however if your willing to take a plunge, the top flavors I have tried so far have been Chocolate Coconut Chew, Coconut Cream Pie, Cinnamon Roll, and Cashew Cookie in that order. Some flavors such as Apple Pie, Cherry Pie, Key Lime Pie, I find can get old a lot faster and I would probably not go through a 16 box of them before I got somewhat sick of them.<br /><br />PROS<br />+Very tasty (LOVE the Chocolate Coconut Chew and the Cinnamon Roll).<br />+Simple ingredients.<br />+Whole food ingredients.<br />+Small, portable.<br />+Price is very reasonable.<br />+Filling.<br /><br />CONS<br />+No organic option.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />The price at Amazon is superb compared to elsewhere, you probably won't find anything in this price range at this quality, from what I have experienced. They are a good snack when you are on the go, perfect for a University student at that. Simple, whole food ingredients, the way it is meant to be. Definitely recommended. Will get a 5 star rating once they release an organic version!

review/text: These bars are not marketed as a diet aid.  They are organic raw food bars. Made mostly of fruit and nuts, Larabar products do not hide the fact that natural ingredients have calories and fat.  But can they be part of a healthy diet? Definitely. Taste is subjective - I myself happen to enjoy the flavor, but none of Larabar's products are going to taste like a Milky Way. When you're tempted to go for the really bad stuff, it's nice to have these around, but it helps if you like the taste of the natural ingredients.

I've had the apple pie, which is appropriately named, the jocalat(chocolate) I think will be disappointing to most in the beginning if you're really expecting true chocolate taste, but the actual flavor does grow on you, and the pecan pie is really delicious but it doesn't taste anything like pecan pie.  It's more like a very tasty, nutty, gooey date bar.  So if you don't get your hopes up with the flavors, I think you'll like them very much, AND they are truly wholesome and are perfect for the Paleo Diet.

review/summary: Amazing New Flavor
review/text: Peanut Butter and Jelly Larabars is a new flavor (to me, anyway, because I just discovered them in the stores here).  They are really awesome.<br /><br />I admit, I've never been a fan of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with light bread, but I LOVED peanut butter and jelly on graham crackers.  Now that I've gone vegan, I can't eat peanut butter and jelly or graham crackers, but this PB&J Larabar tastes just like the peanut butter and jelly on graham crackers that I used to eat.  And even for non-vegans, these bars are still good - anybody can eat them.  They taste just like whatever the flavor is, and are healthy (even though you'd never know it, because they taste so good!)<br /><br />These bars are healthy, natural, soy-free, vegan, kosher.  They have no added sugar, and no chemicals.  It is amazing how something so natural and simple can be so good.<br /><br />Larabars are good to pack for trips, lunches, or anytime you need some energy (or just food); they are convenient because you don't have to cook, measure, slice, or stir, and you don't need a container with a special lid.  You don't need anything!  You just open and eat!!!  All the flavors are good for energy or hunger-control, but when I am really hungry, my favorite flavors are peanut butter cookie and peanut butter and jelly (the featured flavor in this particular review).  The ones with peanut butter (not really peanut butter, but just peanuts) seem to give me more energy.<br /><br />I love all flavors of Larabars (I haven't yet discovered a flavor that I didn't like), but I do have my favorites, depending on the mood I'm in.  Like I mentioned in the prior paragraph, Peanut butter cookie and peanut butter and jelly are my favorites if I am really hungry.<br /><br />All the flavors of Larabars are healthy, and even though they have no added sugar, they certainly crave my desire for sweets (because they do taste like they have sugar, even though they don't).  I am not really a big "sweets" eater; I prefer salts.  If I could just have salty foods all the time, I think I could totally give up sweets.  But even those who do love sweets, I think these bars would satisfy their sweets desire, also, because they taste like whatever the flavor is.

review/text: The Peanut Butter and Jelly LARABAR is really, really good. The company struck gold with this one. If you are a fan of those sandwiches, you'll dig these as an on-the-go-snack. I just have a few minor gripes: one is that I like to "stretch" Larabars  (while still in the wrapper), because they're usually a little fat and brick-like and it makes them last longer/more fun to pick at, but when you smoosh this particular flavor out, it gets a quite crumbly (think pieces of peanut popping out); so, it's not as blended as other flavors. Also, it'd be nice if it were a bit saltier -- sometimes you just crave that, especially if it's a meal replacement and you're in a peanut-butter-and-jelly mood -- and a little protein-heavier. Finally, I really wish the entire Larabar line (not just Jocalat) was organic! That would really be awesome. But, these are nitpick-y things. You'll like this flavor -- a lot. In full disclosure, I haven't ordered them on Amazon, but I believe after eating my first one, I told whoever was in the room with me to please buy me a box of them because it was "SO. GOOD." So, go for it.

review/summary: Get them by the case!
review/text: These things are amazing. Healthy, instant, tasty, and pretty inexpensive at ~$1.50 per bar. They are free of dairy, gluten, meat, soy, etc and are raw, so almosy anyone can eat them.<br /><br />Now onto the flavor analysis. The first flavor I tried was Key Lime Pie. It was really, really good. Next I tried Cherry Pie. It wasn't as good, but with its strong flavor I found it to be the perfect companion to a few pieces of dark chocolate. When I had women over (I'm a young single bachelor) I'd share with them some dark chocolate and a cherry pie larabar and they would almost get as much enjoyment from that as they did from me. I just opened my new box of Lemon and it is easily my favorite flavor so far. Incredible, I don't want to risk trying another flavor because lemon is so good. My roommate preferred the lime but says the lemon is his second best.<br /><br />So to recap: these are good, buy them.

review/summary: Love Lara Bars, Just not this Flavor
review/text: The Cherry Pie flavor is, for me, far too tart. I really prefer the pecan Pie bar out of all the "Pie" flavors.

review/summary: coconut cream pie -- 100% PALEO
review/text: The coconut cream pie bars are 100% PALEO.  And they taste AWESOME!  Don't let the name fool you -- cream pie sounds gross!  But they taste AWESOME!  All the ingredients are PALEO: nuts (no peanuts), dates, virgin coconut oil.  No added sugar, gluten free, soy free, no GMO ingredients.  GET SOME!

review/summary: Very tasty, chewy and satisfying, although a bit too high in fat for me
review/text: I got these when Amazon was running a very good promotion, so it worked out to something like .60 a bar.  These have a really nice, tangy taste (the cherries) and a really satisfying chewy texture. I like that it's pretty natural and simple ingredients (grounds nuts, cherry, dates etc.), but for my preference, it's a bit too high in fat.  I like my energy bars to have no more than 3 grams of fat (or 4 max), while these have 8 (but then again, those lower fat bars don't taste as good as these).  ;-)<br /><br />I would try another flavor of these if there was another good sale and if I could get any that were lower in fat.

review/summary: Essential, HONEST Nourishment in a Delicious Flavor Assortment
review/text: Ginger Snap is my favorite of the Larabars. For me it seems to provide the epitome of potency these bars have available.<br /><br />The combination of Ginger and Cloves with the nuts and dates, seems to give a cleansing, balancing, renewing, and empowering type of immediate, essential nourishment. I'm amazed at how fast this flavor will give me a solid physical strengthening when I'm lagging from having pushed too close to draining past ready reserves. After just a few luxuriously flavorful bites, I can feel an amazingly positive effect.<br /><br />What I noticed with tremendous relief, and a significant amount of awe upon first reading the wrapper on these bars was the basic, clear ingredients listing along one side, with the "NO SOY, NO GMO" noted on the other side. I had begun to believe that I'd never see a label which would give me that type of refreshing feeling of finally being able to eat something without fear of how much it would contribute to an already painful situation of serious health issues. To find that it would contribute instead to healing and strengthening had literally rekindled a lost concept.<br /><br />With the huge variety of simple, sane, satisfying flavor blends available in this line of tasty and true nutritional offerings, I enjoy asking myself what I most have a taste for at any moment when I need a solid [not pseudo with a skull-and-cross-bones price tag] energy lift. [I always carry at least 4 flavors in my purse.]<br /><br />I don't know what else to say except that I feel blessed, and that I tremendously appreciate what Lara has had the inner wisdom, creative versatility, and visceral fortitude to accomplish.<br /><br />Well done, Lady!<br /><br />Live long and prosper,<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt

review/summary: Not preservative-free
review/text: These bars do taste great without being too sweet. A much healthier alternative than candy bars or the bars with added processed protein, but they are not 100% natural.<br />Although it is not listed in their ingredients, the bars do contain citric acid. It is probably added as a preservative by whoever supplies their dried fruit. It took me years to track down an eczema allergy to citric acid and these bars trigger it.

review/summary: Larabar Banana Bread
review/text: Great Bar. Tastes like banana bread with only 3 ingredients. I've tried cashew cookie, and cherry pie, and even though they taste good, they don't need to match the taste of something as distinctive as banana bread. This bar amazingly tastes like banana bread without bread!<br />My boyfriend doesn't like dry bars, and this one is nice an moist. I took it snowboarding as a small snack and it doesn't get frozen solid. I plan on buying this flavor often.

review/summary: COLLEGE STUDENT'S BEST FRIEND
review/text: These kept me healthy through college - a GREAT studying snack, because the fruit and nuts both keep you energized and facilitate brain function (at least that's what my nutritionist friend told me). End result was I graduated engineering in 3.5 years with a great GPA! And I did not gain weight like most of my dorm buddies, even though I had very little time for exercise. Seriously - send your kid a pack of these instead of cookies or candy, they will thank you!<br /><br />My favorite bar was lemon - although I think that's a personal preference. Haven't tried all of them, but I mean too. My new husband and my father both need a health makeover (one needs to watch glycemic impact, the other needs to watch fat & sodium), but both love junk food, and so I'm going to try and get them into these too!
