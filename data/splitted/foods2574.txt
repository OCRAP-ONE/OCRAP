review/summary: Worth the money, but nothing to write home about.
review/text: First of all, shipping and packaging went very well. I'm impressed in that regard. After reading the previous review, I was kind of expecting to be blown away by the wonderful smell and taste. I'm not saying it tastes or smells bad, but it's not as amazing as the other reviewer puts it. The fragrance and taste is hard to describe, but good. I brewed it at a relatively hot temperature for about 6 minutes, and added sugar with it. The tea tastes fruity but with a cinnamon kick to it as well as floral undertones. I would recommend this product to another person, but I don't think I'll be able to use all 16oz of it. Buying a smaller bag might be a good idea.

review/summary: Wonderful Taste and Aroma
review/text: I love tea especially during the cold months. I found this item and loved the price for the quantity I got. The description of the ingredients was interesting. I love it!<br /><br />The aroma is wonderful. As soon as I opened the pouch at work, the entire office was filled with it. Everyone who walked in commented on it. The taste was wonderful, too. The scent is floral with a cinnamon flair to it. You don't have to brew it. Just having the bag open fills the air with that smell.<br /><br />The taste is sweet. Not too sweet as I cannot handle anything that has too much. This is just the right amount. You don't have to add sweetener to it including honey. It's perfect the way it is.<br /><br />The pouch is resealable and great for the lose leaves you get in this order. You might find that you use it so much that sixteen ounces is not enough.

review/text: Let me begin with there is nothing wrong with the candy--just the price.  It is not specified in the description but these are the mini smarties rolls.  Most smarties contain 15 candies per rolls.  These contain only 10.  A box count of 120 (of the 15 candies/roll) can be obtained for half this price from other non-Amazon vendors.  I should have done my homework.  Most expensive smarties I ever ate.

This is one of those rare products that doesn't have to be advertised andd the company isn't interested in profit alone. this cereal is actually made out of the wheat berry-the best part of wheat-it is Organic wheat! The berry is rolled out under pressure to form a real flake. sprinkled with a little sea salt and dressed up with some organic raisins-you can't get any crispier,tastier or healthier than that! Raisin bran eaters are crazy if they don't try it!!!!!

review/summary: Best tasting Raisin Bran (along with  U.S. Mills Skinner's)
review/text: Erewhon is one of my two favorite raisin brans.  I had always liked raisin bran, but when I tried Skinners Raisin Bran, it was so much better that I switched exclusively to them.  Later, when Skinners became impossible to find in stores, I would try new brands hoping to find a brand that tasted like Skinners.<br />Erewhon tastes as good as Skinners (taste and texture - doesn't get soggy as quickly as other brands) and I am delighted to find a source for my favorite cereal again.

When I asked my sister (we are both grown-ups by now) what breakfast food she remembers eating almost every day as a young'n...she instantly replied "Skinners Raisin Bran!"  BINGO!  Now, get this: I told her I found some at AMAZON...she said, "Oh, I recently bought 12 boxes of it."  That made for quite a laugh, since I though I had made a great re-discover all by myself.  So glad they have kept the original recipe.  Hope you guys will stay after them to keep turning out cases of this good product.  Jack

review/summary: Will Not Satisfy Your Craving For Raisin Bran
review/text: This cereal is good, but if, like me, you have a craving for "real" Raisin Bran (the kind with sugar coated raisins and lots of high fructose corn syrup) this will not satisfy your craving.  The flakes are weirdly tiny, like flattened rice crispies, and kind of hard.  They taste better the longer you let the cereal soak.  The raisins, however, are plentiful and tasty ("real" Raisin Bran's raisins are often dried out and hard -- but these are plump and yummy without the sugar coating).  I hope that after 6 boxes of this cereal I will forget all about "real" Raisin Bran.

review/text: Look closely at the small flakes. They are flattened whole wheat kernels.<br />They are not ground up, flattened, sugar soaked, wheat-flour blobs. This makes them much better for you than any flour-based cereal.  They have a lower glycemic impact. Your guts have to work a bit harder to extract the starch from an intact grain of wheat.

review/text: I wasn't sure how I would like this cereal because of horrors from my childhood. I must say when I was growing up the other Raisin Bran was a family favorite and I could never stand it. I am on my 3rd box already and will be ordering  this over and over again. The flakes stay crispy, the raisins are plump and fresh and organic to boot. As others have noted there are loads and loads of raisins in each box. Low sodium, just enough protein and the only sugar is natural from the rasins. If I could give it 10 * I would. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Great cereal
review/text: This is a great organic cereal.  I love that each individual flake comes from one wheat berry that is steamed then squished - no overprocessed flakes mixed with sugar as mass market raisin bran cereals.  This does mean that the Erewhon flakes are small, as a few reviewers already mentioned.  I really like the texture of this cereal.  It tastes great with a blend of vanilla soymilk and cow's milk to provide a bit of sweetness (since the cereal itself does not contain sugar).  I do let it sit after adding milk, to soften a bit before eating.  It could use a few more raisins, but that is not a big enough deal to downgrade my rating.  Another consideration is that this is not a fortified/enriched cereal, so it is different from the typical cereals that provide a bunch of added vitamins.  It does fill you up (6g fiber per serving) and helps to reduce between meal junk food cravings.

review/summary: Tastes better than great!!!
review/text: No added sugar, low sodium and high in fiber makes this healthy but it really does taste great. The flakes are small but I don't get why that matters as it did to one reviewer, oh well.... If you want a great tasting raisin bran that tastes fresh without all the added crap that other cereal makers add in then this is the cereal for you!<br /><br />****Update****<br />I should have kept my mouth shut, now everyone in the house wants this cereal only so it looks like I will be upping our subscibe and save intervals....LOL! I truly have to tell you that everyone that has tasted this cereal at our house now wants to switch from the sugar laden cereals that the big companies are pushing on us. I wrote to one of the biggest asking if they would be offering any natural cereals without all the sugar and they replied that unfortunately that is what their customers want so they do not have any plans besides the reduced sugar versions they offer now.

review/summary: Erewhon Raisin Bran
review/text: I have eaten Erewhon Raisin Bran for several years. It is low in sodium, has no sugar, honey, evaporated cane whatever and thus meets my needs.  Also, I save money ordering from Amazon with free shipping; the price for this item in the market where I shop is high.  I rate the product 4 stars.  If they put a few more raisins in the box, they'd get the other star from me and two yums to boot.  Respectfully submitted

review/summary: dog food tastes better
review/text: I knew taste is subjective, reading all the praises to this cereal here, but not by that much. It is the worst raisin bran I've ever tasted.  The first box I ever bought, we had to throw it away as no one would eat it.  The other day, I asked my husband to pick up some raisin bran (we only eat organic)from a store, instructing not to get the brown box - I did not remember the brand name.  Sure enough he comes home with this new box, which isn't brown anymore *eye roll*.  I just took a spoonful and couldn't even swallow it.  New look, same awful taste.  I don't know if cascadian farms raisin bran is available where you guys all live, but you should really give it a try. Heck, the store-brand organic raisin bran tastes better than this one.

I will not be ordering any more items that are fragile. So note to reader be cautious, I would have been better off buying this item at the store. With this said, all the other products I have been very happy with from Amazon. So thank you Amazon, but I needed to advise consumers like myself.

review/summary: Great Cracker - Not So Great Shipping
review/text: I bought a single box of these crackers on Amazon a couple weeks ago.  As others have mentioned, the crackers arrived pretty broken up, so they don't insulate them at all well when they package them.  Since the cracker's were still, relatively speaking, in tact (i.e., not crumbs!), I'm deducting only one star.  However, as for flavor, I was delighted!  Since being diagnosed with CD, I feel like I've tried just about every GF cracker on the market that I could get my hands on, and NONE of them were worth buying a second time - until now!<br /><br />These really are the best tasting GF crackers I've had, and I love them!  If I could find them locally, I would buy them from the store, but since they are only available to me via the net, I have to get them on Amazon.  Hopefully, someone at the company who packs these will read these reviews and do something about how poorly packaged they are for shipping.<br /><br />GREAT cracker! Not so great shipping.

We layered them with lunchmeat and cheese as a heavy snack before my son's baseball game.  Yum!  Our family happily ate the entire box in one sitting.  I haven't ordered these crackers from Amazon yet so I can't comment on breakage during shipping. (I have had substantial breakage of other crackers ordered through Amazon.)  Definately worth trying if you or someone you feed needs a gluten free diet!

Unfortuantely, Amazon's shipping was not so perfect, and one box of five arrived completely crumbled and another not quite as bad but, nevertheless, somewhat crumbled.  The package must have taken quite a beating by the post office or UPS, whichever method you used.  I will keep ordering because they are the best gluten free cracker on the market that I've found in 4 years of having a wheat allergy but I hope the shipping can be improved.

review/summary: Best solution to giving up coffee!
review/text: I bought a case of all three products, Inka, Pero and Cafix in order to compare them. Honestly? They are all the same, so go with whatever is the cheapest. I think I did like Cafix the best, but it may be a mental thing with the name at least sounding somewhat like Coffee. There is little difference in all three, they look identical with only tiny coloration differences. All by themselves they do not taste like coffee and if you are a black coffee drinker? Pass, because you will not be satisfied with the taste. It is very bland all by itself. BUT, if you like cream in your coffee? You won't even notice the difference between coffee and these products within a week or two you will forget you are not drinking coffee. I am PERFECTLY happy with all three products and will continue to drink them;I will choose by PRICE due to the very similar make of them all. The cans all read the same ingredient wise.

Coffee, Tea and Chocolate would hurt my stomach so I had to go cold turkey and quit.When I read the ingredients on the package I wasn't too convinced it would taste good. Wow, I was wrong. Naturalis Inka has been an answer to my prayer. It is like drinking instant coffee without the caffeine. I missed my morning cup of coffee with flavored creamers and now I can look forward to having it again and a night time cup  also. I found this at my local health food store.  I highly recommend this product for those who can not have caffeine.

Once the surprise wore off, I decided to give it a try anyway and see if I like it, and, as an alternative for my guests who have given up on caffeine.<br /><br />I loved it!  It is smooth, and, as it combines with hot water, it makes a nice, cappuccino-like foam.  I use cream, no sugar, with it, and find its taste very pleasing, with just the right amount of bitterness, and no aftertaste.<br /><br />Inka is now a permanent coffee substitute in my home.  I like to drink it in the evening when I usually avoid caffeine, or as a treat any other time of the day. Great product!

I tried this because I was impressed with the Amazing Grass organic wheat grass.<br />The amazing meal would mix better with a blender. I use a spoon and add water until most of it eventually mixes. The taste is very good for a protein drink! The organic Madagascar Vanilla is delicious and the undercurrent of chai complements it well. The organic fruits and veggie in the drink are not detectable and so this is an easy way to get them in my diet. This is a gentle drink for when it is too late for dinner. It also works well for breakfast when my stomach needs something light. I feel pretty good when I have this drink, too.

review/summary: Not much vanilla taste
review/text: I thought this would be good for morning smoothies with milk and fruit.  It really doesn't have much of a vanilla taste at all.  I also bought the berry and like that one much better used with juice .  If you add it to milk with a lot of fruit, I used one packet for two drinks it is ok.  Not my favorite taste but it does fill you up and hopefully gives you the vitamins it states it will.  I am going to keep trying to find ways to add it to drinks but I am sure no matter what you add to it, it will always taste like "grass" and will always be "green"... I think it is worth the benefits if you can get past the taste.

review/summary: Only one packet - very expensive!
review/text: At the time of my purchase, the unit price was listed as $0.04/oz, so at a price of $1.19 I expected I'd be getting around 27 packets.  Maybe a little optimistic, yes...well turns out I received only one packet, making the shipping cost prohibitively expensive.  Unless this becomes prime eligible or the seller begins to offer a larger quantity (so that the additional shipping cost is less significant) I do not recommend buying this product from this seller.

review/summary: Best Butterscotch flavoring EVER!
review/text: This is truly BUTTERSCOTCH at its best!  If you make pies, cakes, flavored coffees, you definitely need this Butterscotch Flavoring.  You can use it instead of vanilla for butterscotch pies, use half butterscotch and vanilla for cakes for an extra depth of flavor, and, one of my favorites is a cup of fresh coffee with a few drops of  Butterscotch Flavoring, a few drops of Stevia, and a bit of cream for an incredible dessert with fewer calories - unless you make your pies with Stevia or Splenda.<br /><br />This is truly a staple in my kitchen!

review/text: I ordered 12 of these bully sticks for my rather 'aggressive chewer'. I was pleased when they arrived and I saw that they were a fairly decent size. I did not find the odor terribly offensive, although bully sticks are somewhat pungent in their own right. My scottie seems to really enjoy these and I feel they are safer than rawhide chews.  This is the best price, even with shipping that I have found.....places like PetsMart and Petco are way too expensive.  The only reason I did not give a 5 star is that they could have been a little thicker, if that were the case I would have definitely given 5 stars.  Will reorder again in a larger quanity.

review/text: I was pleased with these bully sticks - after reading some of the reviews prior to buying I was concerned because some said they smelled horrible (which bully sticks do have some smell)  and others said that they weren't braided "tightly" , But when I got this product they were of the exact same quality as the ones I get at my local farm store and local independently owned pet store for HALF the price.<br />These Bully sticks are very very good - they don't smell anymore than normal and they are strong - my dogs go through bully sticks in less than 15 minutes so I am pleased to find some at a reasonable price!!!  I was Extremely pleased with my purchase and will purchase them again

review/summary: My dogs love these Bully Sticks!
review/text: About once or twice a month I enjoy hours of peace while my three dogs enjoy their bully sticks. The medium size dog goes through them in two the three hours. The other small dogs can get four times as much time out of them. I think the braided bully's last longer as they are three bully's twisted together. These did not have any significant smell to them. I do not let my dogs chew on anything without me being right there to watch over them in case of choking. I thought that these bully's were well worth the price.

This brand had been virtually odor free...so very much hoping my next batch is as good as the first. These last my little guy about a week.....he loves them! I do watch him carefully as sometimes the pieces get small and he then likes to swallow them whole....i just replace the coveted piece with a whole new one! He far prefers these to any other kind of chew toy. I also like that they are natural....great stuff!

review/text: I've bought dozens of these bully sticks for my dog and as gifts for others.  All the dogs love them and spend hours chewing on them!  Since they're thick and have three strands, some of the dogs unravel the braid and eat one strand at a time.<br /><br />As far as bully sticks go, they're not too smelly either.  Plus since they come from grass-fed free-ranging cows I feel good feeding them to my dog.

review/summary: Good-Quality and Affordable but Not Exactly Odor-Free
review/text: These bully sticks are great!  They really are about 6" in length, so there is no skimping there.  In terms of width and thickness, they are about 1 1/4" wide and 5/8"-3/4" thick.  One bully stick can keep my 10-month-old, 25-lb American Eskimo busy for about 2 hours, which is pretty good to me.  Also, I did not find these sticks to be braided loosely; the braids seemed sufficiently tight.  Lastly, these are really cheap (when I purchased these last week, they cost only $2.50/stick)!<br /><br />Unfortunately, these bully sticks weren't exactly odor-free; the odor was actually quite strong.  This was the only con for me.

review/summary: Soft, High Flavor Gum
review/text: I enjoy chewing gum, and have tried dozens of brands.  One of my favorites has been Fruit Stripe gum.  However, I have found it difficult to find Fruit Stripe gum.  The Marukawa brand offers an intense citric acid flavor and a softer chew than Fruit Stripe gum.  I think Murakawa orange is not quite as true of an orange flavor as Fruit Stripe gum, but the easier chew and more intense flavor are advantages that make this gum a good alternative.  The only other drawback is that the Murakawa gum is a bit more expensive than domestic gum.  However, consider it a novel foreign gourmet gum and give it a chance.  If you are a fan of fruit flavored gums, this one will challenge your tongue.

review/summary: Died and gone to Rambutan Heaven!
review/text: My neighbor just gifted me with two packages of these wonderful fruits! I have never tried Rambutans before, and now wonder what other amazing fruits I have missed out on! They are so easy to open and pop the little fruit out. I just stick the whole thing in my mouth and gently nibble on the fruit until I reach the seed. The taste is very similar to fresh coconut meat only less conconut-ie and slightly acidic. The texture is sort of wet/slimy- only less slimy and only more damp then wet. The seed is about the size and color of an almond. Apparently they can be so what poisonous is eaten, but can be cooked and eaten. These would be wonderful to take on a road trip or on a picnic.  The taste is sweet and mild so young children might enjoy them- just MAKE SURE you cut the meat off so they don't choke on the seed.<br />Bon Appetit!

review/summary: What a treat!
review/text: Ordered these as part of a presentation on Malaysia as this fruit had left a very positive impression on me during my visit.  We gave these to 4th graders who were equally impressed with the exterior soft spikes and the juicy center.  The fruits arrived in good condition, just slightly bruised.  The kept well in the fridge in a single-double layer covered with a damp paper towel.  I had also rinsed in a vinegar-water (1:10 parts) solution to be sure to inhibit any mold (like I do with berries).  They kept from Saturday when they arrived to Thursday with minimal browning.  I ordered 4 pounds and had plenty of fruits for the 40 kids.  I think there were about 55 - 60 fruits all together.  It was a fantastic treat and the kids were requesting we bring them again for the Halloween party!  I'm sure they'll remember the presentation for a long time.
