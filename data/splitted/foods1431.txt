review/text: I love how cheap this value pack is!  Even though this tea doesn't seem to help to increase my milk supply, I still like drinking it.  And since I go through a bunch of it, I hated to have to make a trip to the specialty store every week.  With this large shipment amount and low price, I'm very happy!

review/summary: Quadrupled my production!
review/text: This product worked great for me. I add just a few splashes of apple cider. Started with three cups a day and within two days my production doubled. And within a few weeks it increased by four times! Yes, I was only producing about 3 ounces with five pumps a day, but never expected to get up to 12 ounces! Now I've cut back to one or two cups a day and production has remained stable.

review/summary: Got results within one day
review/text: I can't speak highly enough of this product!!  It gives me results within less than a day.  For a while, I was drinking the max recommended 5 cups a day, but now, on most days, I only drink 2-3 cups and don't drink any on weekends (when I can nurse more).  I drink this tea to keep my supply up during the week so I can pump enough milk for my breastfed baby.  Most days, I ended up with about 6-8 oz. extra that ends up going into the freezer. Without the tea, I'm making only just enough milk.

review/summary: This tea definitely works!
review/text: I went back to work a few weeks ago after having my third baby.  I am full time but only really pump 2 times a day while in the office.  Prior to starting this tea, I was getting aound 14 oz- somewhere around 7 oz each pumping session.  I was also pumping in the morning before work and getting around 5 oz if I didn't also nurse but less if I nursed (around 3 oz).  That seems good - except my baby drank 18 oz one day and she won't start solids for another 2 months at least.  So, I realized that I needed to increase my supply since I only have 30 oz stored in the freezer.  I started drinking this tea - 2-3 cups a day for the past 3 days.  Today, I pumped 4 oz in the morning (I also nursed in the morning), then 16 oz at work.  So I got a total of 20 oz in addition to nursing.<br /><br />I was worried about the taste, as I don't like licorice, but this tea is actually pretty tasty.  I drink it plain.

review/text: This tea was recommended to me by my lactation consultant to help with supply issues. Let me just say, It works! I noticed a difference after just 12 hours. The box tells you to drink 3-5 cups a day. I seem to do just fine with 3. Although, I enjoy drinking it so even upping it to 5 would not be a hardship. Some people have reported that it tastes of black licorice, but I taste the spearmint more. I do sweeten it with sugar, but I take my other teas that way too. I would definitely recommend!

review/summary: Noticeable Results
review/text: Everyone wants to know if it works, right?  Well for me it foes and there is one BIG BUT, you must drink a lot of it. Here's my experience.<br /><br />I've been using it for 5 months now, first 3 months I took it 1-2 times a day and wasn't sure if it was helping. I was also taking Fenugreek supplements but when that gave my baby gas I stopped and just stuck with the tea. I don't like any type of flavored tea and at first I was sure I'd dislike it but I actually love the flavor and it wasn't causing any harm so I kept drinking it.  Then winter came and I was cold and wanted some tea with dinner at nights. I'd take 2 tea bags put it in a big tea pot and have it at nights on top of having some in the day all of a sudden in just a few days I was in pain with oversupply. I couldn't believe it but suspected the tea. So I stopped taking it a for 2 days and noticed my supply went to back to its normal level which was always enough for my daughter.  Started taking about 4-5 tea bags again and BAM supply was  back up. I was feeding my dragsters constantly and in just 1 hour I'd be engorged again, couldn't believe what an effect the tea had.<br /><br />Still using and loving it today after 5 months of breastfeeding.  Would recommend to friends and family.

review/summary: Helpful Lactation Aid
review/text: This product was recommended to me by both my midwife and the lactation consultants at my hospital's breastfeeding clinic.<br /><br />On the days I would drink this, I was able to notice a difference in the amount of milk produced while pumping at work.  I struggled with production, and would usually be able to pump 9 or 10 ounces instead of 7 or 8.  I imagine if you produce more overall, you would hopefully see a similar increase percentage wise.<br /><br />A few things to note that are not on the box:<br />You can make a large batch in the beginning of the day, and then drink throughout the day, either by reheating or chilled, and it will not lose it's potency...same with being able to mix with other teas once brewed if you find the taste undesirable.  Since it is imperative that you follow the brewing directions that require seeping, while covered for ten minutes, these are a few tips the lactation clinic suggested to make sure it was easier to fit into my day as a working professional.

review/summary: One cup a day worked for me.
review/text: Honestly, I'm a skeptic when it comes to herbal treatments (most of it is just snake oil). But this stuff is the real deal. I started off just drinking this because I like herbal tea, and I wanted to drink something I knew was safe for nursing and the baby. Before I started drinking this, I was only making 4-6 oz a day. By the end of the second week, I had to stop at around 10 oz because the bottles on my pump can't hold anymore... And I was only drinking one cup a day.<br /><br />Perhaps it was just a natural increase, but the fact I ended up making about 1.5 to 2 times the amount my baby drank when he was at daycare sort of made me doubt it.<br /><br />And about the taste: I didn't like it at first. The smell is unpleasant. But the taste isn't so bad. It's sort of like coffee in that you have to get used to it first, and then it grows on you.<br /><br />I highly recommend mothers returning to work buy a box or two of this. This will keep your supply up just in case the transition doesn't go well. I also suggest starting out at 1 or 2 cups a day instead of the recommended 3-5. The box only comes with 16 bags, and at $4-$6 a pop, it gets expensive. Judging from the reviews, results vary from person to person, so you may not need as much as the box says.

review/summary: Perfect for Breast-Feeding Mothers
review/text: This tea is very good especially for Breast-feeding mothers. The milk production grows extremely fast with all the natural ingredients in the tea (Differs from Mother to Mother). Also if it is convenient and suits anyone, Mothers can take Fenugreek(Methi) Powder also, it is even more helpful in producing milk. It's all natural but very bitter in taste, but if taken 1tsp 2-3 times a day helps a lot.

review/summary: Great at first
review/text: This tea really does work, especially (for me) at first.  I have trouble with my milk supply - and IF I pump TWICE at work, I'll get a whopping total of about 5 1/2 ounces.  I can't imagine pumping 8 ounces, let alone 15.  While this tea didn't make me produce gallons of milk, it allowed me to sustain my milk supply.  After a couple of months, though, it didn't work as well.... or maybe it's just that my little one needed even more milk.  Motherlove's goat's rue tincture works really well though. For me, it's better than the tea, but I take both daily anyway.

review/summary: This gave me oversupply!
review/text: I brought this tea with me to the hospital when I was in labor. I drank around 3 cups of this tea per day. It took 5 days for my milk to come in and when it did...................My lil bub would have completely full diapers almost every 2-3 hours. His diapers were full to the point of leaking. He also had a bowel movement in almost every diaper change! My bub nurses 8-10 times a day, and I need to pump 3-4 times a day to relieve engorgement. During my pumping sessions, I pump around 7 ounces per session. My freezer is overflowing with breast milk! My bub is now four weeks old and I still have that problem. I only used this tea in the hospital and that was it. I will use it again if my supply declines. I purchased 3 boxes of this thinking that I would need to use this everyday. I'll write an update about this. The taste is not too bad. It tastes like black licorice.

review/summary: excellent tea, recommended to take a fenugreek supplement as well
review/text: This tea is really really good!  It's worth drinking for the taste alone!  I started drinking this tea when my baby was only eight weeks old and my milk supply already started to dry up.  I also recommend taking fenugreek and milk thistle with this product (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008RH67GE">Fenugreek (610mg) 100 Capsules + FREE Milk Thistle Powder 25 Grams</a>).  I drank the tea by itself for the first week but then panicked when my milk supply only slightly increased.  I don't think there is quite enough fenugreek in this tea because I added the fenugreek and milk thistle after it being recommended to me and literally the next day my milk supply was back in full force.  Did I say the tea tastes great, always a plus!

review/summary: This herbal tea really does work!!!
review/text: This is my third child andd I have been concerned about milk production since about day one, due to him not seeming satisfied for very long after a nursing session. I was pumping about 2-3 ounces at a time, but if he took a bottle of expressed milk, he would end up eating 4-5 ounces. After the first day of drinking this tea 3 times, I was able to pump at least 5 ounces, if not 6. I am returning to work in a month and will continue to drink this in order to assure my supply is adequate when we are separated. And I am not one to rely upon herbal remedies, or even really think they work in most cases, but this really did!

review/summary: ***Miraculous!***
review/text: Before trying this miraculous product, I had been happily nursing my second daughter for 9 months with no problems.  Then I got my first postpartum period and my milk supply was down to almost nothing.  My daughter was miserable, biting me and crying at every nursing session and quickly ended up constipated.  For a week I was nursing constantly, pumping and drinking over a gallon of water a day to increase my supply, with increased frustration being the only result.  I was devastated and my daughter refused formula in bottles and sippy cups except when she was asleep.  I knew I had to either wean or find a miracle!<br />  I googled my issue and learned about a few products that could possibly help.  I can't swallow pills so fenugreek wasn't an option but this tea sounded totally doable.  I ordered the pack of 6 with overnight shipping for only an extra $3.99 with my Amazon Prime benefits.<br />  To brew the tea, I pour 8oz. of boiled water over the tea bag and cover the cup with a saucer and let it sit for a minimum of 10 minutes.  Then I dunk the tea bag 15 or so times and then gently squeeze it to extract every last bit.  When I tried my first cup, I hated it.  It tasted like musty, minty licorice.  I have a sensitive stomach so I thought there was no way I'd be able to drink it.  Adding honey didn't help but just a bit of sugar made it taste okay.  My second cup was a little bit better and by the third cup, I genuinely liked the taste of it!  I drink 4 cups a day and now I actually crave it!<br />  The first day of use I didn't notice any increase in my milk supply but I did smell a bit like maple syrup, which my husband actually likes.  When I woke up the next morning my breasts felt slightly fuller, but not much of a difference.  I again drank 4 cups that day, waking up the next morning with fuller breasts and enough milk to sustain my daughter's thirst.  And the next morning?  I woke up practically engorged!<br />I have been enjoying 4 cups of this miraculous, soothing product everyday for almost 2 weeks now and my daughter and I are both so thrilled and grateful.  Nursing is peaceful once again!

review/summary: Definitely works!
review/text: I am currently nursing twin girls and have had quite a few bumps along the way.  I guess you could say it was the perfect storm for something to go wrong.  Nursing multiples, returning to work full time and having babies that slept through the night wrecked havoc on my body.  When they were 3 1/2 months old, I developed a blocked milk duct on one breast, which led to a milk blister.  I did all kinds of research online and did everything I was supposed to do: compresses, massaging, extra nursing and pumping, etc.  Once the milk blister burst, it ended up leading to mastitis.  I was put on an antibiotic for 10 days and missed 3 days of work.  At this time, despite my increased pumping and nursing, my milk supply went down.  I was barely producing 2 oz from each breast at a single pumping session which led me to tap into my freezer stash.  My babies drink three 5 oz bottles at day care - each (total needed: 30 oz - not including what I feed them at home before and after day care).  And here I was barely getting 2 oz for each baby, times three pumping sessions (total producing: 12 oz if I was lucky, not including what they got from me when I nursed before and after day care).  My coworker told me about the Mother's Milk tea.  I didn't realize what I ordered was an entire case, but looking back, it was well worth it.<br /><br />I am not a tea drinker at all. I have always wanted to acquire a taste for tea and tried a million different kinds, made a million different ways.  This tea, at first, tasted horrible!  Everyone is different, but this is what worked for me.  I figured, I don't like my coffee super hot and need to let it cool down, so tea might be the same way.  I quickly found out that drinking it cold was far worse than anything I have ever tasted.  Because of the taste, I also drank it sparingly.  Based on the way I was drinking it in the beginning (or, more appropriately, NOT drinking it) I did not see much for results and almost gave up on nursing all together.  I came back to the Amazon site and read more reviews and then decided to try a different approach.  Here is what really worked for me:  make and drink a cup of tea within the hour prior to nursing or pumping.  Take a cup with a lid, or make your own lid using a plate, add the tea bag, then add the water.  At home, I use a cup of water heated up from the microwave for about a minute to a minute and a half (depending on how hot the water was from my faucet), at work, I use the hot water spout from our water cooler, cover and let it sit and seep for about 8 - 10 minutes.  After the 8 - 10 minutes have passed, I dip the tea bag a few times, then squeeze it out before discarding. Then I add in about a teaspoon of honey.  Be sure to use the honey from the teddy bear bottle because it is cooked honey and not honey from a neighbor's back yard....(that's another story about bacteria and what is safe and not safe for babies.)  Stir and drink.  I drink it rather quickly and used to have to hold my breath when I drank it, but not so much any more. I still drink it quickly, but I don't have to hold my breath.  It is much more bearable this way.  The taste has actually grown on me and I look forward to drinking that warm cup of tea.<br /><br />Since I have started drinking it more consistently, five times a day, I have noticed my production has most definitely increased!  I went from barely 2 oz from each breast to 5 oz and sometimes more, out of each breast.  I am now producing what the babies are drinking the next day at day care.  I am still hoping to be able to add back to my freezer stash, but that will come in time.  I am proud to say that the babies are just over five months at the time of writing this review and are still being fed exclusively on breast milk (no formula) and two meals a day of oatmeal and/or stage 1 baby food. Hope this helps someone.  Good luck to all!

review/summary: It works!
review/text: This is my second child, and I didn't produce well for the first one, so I'd pretty much resigned myself to minimal milk production and the theory that anything was better than nothing.  I was pumping at work three times a day and taking home about 9 ounces of milk total (and at that, it's more than I'd managed with the first child) when I caught a cold, and my production started to dwindle again, even though I wasn't taking any drugs.  Frustrated but unwilling to wean my baby at only 2 months old, I started taking this tea in the hope that it would at least sustain my current level of production.  Because it's a little on the expensive side (I was buying it locally at the full retail price) I only drank 3 cups a day.  (It recommends 3-5.)<br /><br />A week later, with my cold only just starting to clear up, I was taking home almost 12 ounces of milk.  Another week and a half later, I'm catching another cold (the downside of having 2 kids in daycare...) but I'm taking home a solid 14-15 ounces of milk every day.  This tea is the ONLY THING I have done differently -- no other supplements or dietary changes, no changes in feeding or pumping schedules -- so I know for sure it's the tea that's doing it!<br /><br />I don't know where its effectiveness will level out, or if my production will continue to stay elevated if I stop drinking the tea, but at this point, I'm just thrilled with the short term results!

review/summary: Tasty Tea that Works!
review/text: Along with pumping often, this tea has helped to increase my supply after returning to work.  I tried fenugreek tablets, took the maximum dosage (12 tablets daily for the brand I purchased), and it did nothing.  Lactation consultant said that for some people, the combination of herbs found in the tea is more effective than a single herb.<br /><br />I had a very hard time w/ my supply when I returned to work, but am determined to continue nursing.  Here is what has helped:<br />1. Drinking this tea.  I need to drink 4-5 cups a day for it to be effective.  I just boil a pot of water in the morning, steep 5 bags for 15 minutes, and then drink the prepared tea throughout the day.<br />2. Pumping at least 3 times per day, either instead of nursing or 30 minutes after nursing.<br />3. Bringing pictures of the baby to work (not sure why this helped... maybe hormones?).<br /><br />Good luck!

review/summary: Placebo?  I don't think so!!  IT WORKS!!!!
review/text: This product was recommended to me by a few nurses & lactation consultants.  I wasn't going to get as I'm not much of a "wholistic medicine" person and read that fenugreek products are more of a placebo type of drug.  That is, as a placebo, the benefit of the drug is a mental / emotional one not a proven factual/medical one.  I have to disagree & highly recommend this product.  I have numerous issues against me in the breastfeeding department... I'm an older mom, I have thyroid issues, had fertility issues and my child was not accomodating to breastfeeding.  For a few weeks, and per the advice of a few professionals, I was doing an insane "booby boot camp" to increase my supply.  I was attempting to do this at EACH feeding: breast feed for 10-15 minutes per side, bottle feed with a formula supplement, and then pump for 20 minutes.  Doing this took a minimum of 2 hours and was done at every 3 hour increment.  Insane!!!  My child also would not breast feed unless I used a nipple shield as well.  I believe that all this was caused when I was in the hospital, she wouldn't feed well and the hospital 1) got her hooked to the nipple shield, 2) got her started down the bottle / formula route since she was a tiny baby, and 3) NEGLECTED TO TELL ME that I needed to pump to keep my supply up.  The combo of the events was a powerfully negative effect on my milk supply, breastfeeding abililty, and well being.  Needless to say, I was a physical and emotional wreck, but I was willing to do the booby boot camp to try to increase my milk supply and ultimately exclusively breastfeed my baby.<br /><br />So here's the point:  After drinking the tea ONE time, I had immediate results.  My pumping supply increased about 3x.  Now, my supply is fine.  Even better, I'm no longer on booby boot camp and not providing supplement of formula OR expressed breast milk to my daughter.  Next stage is getting her off the nipple shield, but everything is in phases.  Plus, it's now some crazy early hour, I really should be sleeping, but I wanted to leave feedback so others don't suffer like I did.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I also recommend Dr. Harvey Karp's book "Happiest Baby on the Block".  The calming recommendations have been a life saver for me.  Did I mention that my husband travels for work and is gone unpredictibly for days at a time? Oh, and we moved when I was 8 months pregnant.<br /><br />TRUST ME: The book & the tea have been hugely helpful.  Sanity and sleep never felt better!!<br /><br />Best of luck to everyone. Welcome to the sisterhood!!!

review/summary: More Milk!
review/text: I returned to work when my little guy was 3 months old and by 5 months I had used ALL my freezer stash.  My baby had only had breastmilk but I couldn't keep up with what they fed him at daycare.<br /><br />He eats 16oz while I am at work.  I was pumping 3-4 times at work for 20 minutes at a time and only getting 2 1/2 oz per session.  I was so frustrated and exhausted!  I tried everything: more water, more frequent pumping sessions, more frequent nursing while with the baby, I even took a nursing weekend where all I did was nurse and pump and rest but I still couldn't get more than 3 oz per pumping session.<br /><br />I started with 5 cups of tea per day.  I don't like the smell or flavor of black licorice so I was worried that I would have to gag this tea down...it isn't pleasant but it is tolerable.  I can even drink it without adding sugar, honey, or milk but it will never be a drink I like or want.<br /><br />Day one I really didn't see any change at all.<br /><br />Day two I pumped 3 times and got 11 oz which was the most I had gotten at work in weeks.<br /><br />Day three I pumped 3 times at work and each time I got 5 oz or more.  I ended the day with 17 oz and was thrilled!  That evening I nursed my son when we got home but could tell I wasn't empty so I pumped right after nursing and got another 2oz.  That night I leaked through the night and had to change my shirt...now I don't drink any tea after 6 pm.<br /><br />I've been using the tea for only ten days now and have started a new freezer stash that is currently at 20 oz.  The peace of mind is great, knowing I have extra.  I am consistently pumping 5oz per session and getting the extra 2-3oz after my nursing session with my son at 5:30 and sometimes I pump at 8 p.m. after nursing and get another 2-3 oz.  As an added bonus, my little guy was still waking every two hours until I started drinking this tea.  The past three nights he has slept 4 hours at a time.

review/summary: Didn't work for me but worth a shot
review/text: This did nothing for me, as far as I could tell...  and I was drinking 5 bags a day.  But on the plus side, the flavor wasn't too bad - I wouldn't pick it over one of my favorite teas just for drinking, but with a little turbinado sugar and milk, it was quite tolerable - unlike some medicinal teas I've had!  I am not a fan of licorace and feared this would be nasty to drink but it wasn't bad.  Worth a shot - great if it works for you, but if it doesn't, there are other things to try.  (Motherlove tintures seemed to boost my supply very well when this tea and fenugreek capsules didn't work)

review/summary: Works for me..
review/text: I was pumping and bringing home abt 15-16oz a day then literally overnight my supply decreased to 6-8oz a day. Trying to pump when I got home wasn't working out! I was upset and frustrated thinking that I couldn't feed my baby; and I really didn't want to resort to formula.  I tried drinking more water, eating more oatmeal..nothing seemed to work.  So a friend recommended Mother's Milk and my milk has INCREASED!!! I started Friday night and I now have that FULL feeling again.  It's Monday morning now and about 11:30 - pre-Mother's Milk I would have pumped abt  2-3oz. in one session...post-Mother's Milk 6oz in one session. Now the taste to me...a combinations of dirt and licerious, it's awful! But I would drink mud if it would help my milk supply! My little one is 6 months now and I trying to make it to her first b-day.  Hopefully this review will sway you to at least try it, it does work!

review/text: Mother's milk tastes not bad. I am not sure whether it increased my milk since my production did not reduce after I stopped using it. However, be careful of the side effects! My baby showed diarrea, colic sympton, and stomach upset during my use of herb. All symptons went away after I got rid of Mother's milk. If you read PARENTING magazine of October 2011 issue(page 32), you'll know that ANISE, which is one of the main indegrients of Mother's Milk, might cause dangerous neurological problems of children. So, again, be careful of the side effects!

review/text: This tea really works! I was skeptical, but my baby was hospitalized for a couple days for jaundice and the Children's Hospital we took him to bottle fed him when I left the room. I was beside myself when he wouldn't nurse and my milk supply lowered. The hospital told me I would be better off formula feeding, but I knew better. I found this tea online and after just a day at three cups a day, my milk supply was renewed. I highly recommend this and would suggest buying at least a few so you have enough for a couple weeks. It has a nutty taste and although I'm not a tea drinker, I really enjoy drinking this and will continue to do so throughout nursing.

It did not do anything for me at the first day, but I kept at it and hoped it would start working soon. To my surprise, my usually perfect normal and healthy baby started to soil her diaper constantly, and its color is real green. Usually, she is quite regular and only goes once or twice the most. But suddenly, her diaper was dirty every single time we changed her and the color was very green. Despite of that, I kept drinking the tea for at least two more days because I thought it would just go away and I really need it to be working as I was returning to work.<br /><br />However, I finally had to stop it as it did not nothing to boost my milk supply, and baby's stool stays green. On the side note, the taste of tea is not too good either.

review/summary: Danger
review/text: I had my 1st baby in Dec 2010 and had alot of trouble produce milk.<br />so at the advise of just about everyone including a lactaction consultant I tried a similar product also containing fenugreek. I researched it online and one of the side effect was "intestinal distress" well it didn't cause any problems for me, but my baby girl started having diarrhea. She also broke out in hives all over her face. So I did a medline search - something we do in the medical field. Needless to say I wish I'd researched this more before I took it. The medline searched stated the main side effect as intestinal distress but also listed the - allergic side effect I hadnt found before. 1st the hives but more distressing was - "difficulty breathing , and loss of consciousness" needless to say I freaked. Pumped and dumped for the next 4 days. It did increase my milk supply but at the potenical cost of my infants health - totally not worth it. Discuss this with your GYN 1st there are medications such as Reglan they can prescribe you that can do the same thing w/o the complications of this awful stuff. To be fair both my sister and sister in law both took this w/o complication but who would want to take the chance of having the same problem I did, or God forbid worse. FYI I'm a NICU nurse (neonatal ICU) and I really wish more people knew not to fool around with this stuff.

review/summary: SO far, not working for me
review/text: Hey guys! So I finally tried this tea after reading these positive reviews, I was so excited and knew that finally something would work for me and my little one. My son has a milk protein allergy, so there is no decent formula out there that is safe for him and plus I wanted to nurse him, obvious reasons, breast milk is the best nutrition compared to any formulas out there.  So, ever since I went back to work FULL time after 3 months off for maternity leave, my milk dropped significantly. It is sooooo frustrating.  I finished all my frozen stash and it is the worst feeling ever.  So then I started supplementing with some prescription Formula, which taste like crap.  Anyhow, so finally I got this tea in mail, and it is day 3 already, made no difference to my milk production.  I am so UNHAPPY!  Seriously, Like how long do I have to wait for it to work, I am drinking 4-5 tea cups a day.  Are there any other alternatives ladies?

review/summary: Helpful!
review/text: When I first stumbled across this tea, I was grasping in the dark for something to help ramp up my milk production. Since my son was born, I have been unable to exclusively breastfeed him as a result of a not-so-great milk supply (previously I had tried cluster feedings/pumping sessions, oatmeal, copious amounts of water, etc). When I read the reviews about this tea, and saw that women in my predicament were going from so little to producing so much, it gave me hope. While I do have to admit that my milk supply has increased, it is no where near as much as many of the other reviewers have reported. I went from pumping about 2-3 ounces a day (on top of breastfeeding) to pumping 8-10 ounces a day (this in addition to breastfeeding). I have to say that I was slightly disappointed that I did not begin producing as much as some of the other reviewers (I would LOVE to have a freezer supply) and we have had to continue to supplement my son with formula. That being said, I would drink a gallon of this tea a day (no, the taste is not so great at first, but it has grown on me) to be able to give my son an extra ounce of breast milk. All in all, I am satisfied with the results of this tea.

review/summary: I Really Like It As An Ice Tea
review/text: I have been using this tea for around 2 years now and recently discovered that I really enjoy it as an iced tea.  I brew up some concentrate (about 5 bags in a cup),  then add the concentrate and additional cold water (to taste), chill, and then drink.  When I'm ready for a glass I simply pour myself some and add a little sweetener if desired.  My favorite is a little real maple syrup.<br /><br />Sometimes I struggle drinking enough fluid each day.  I have found this to be a way that I readily drink enough and enjoy it.  This in and of itself helps my lactation.<br /><br />A friend of mind who is a certified lactation consultant said that she often recommends this to women who are feeling ill and need to be sure they are drinking enough fluids to maintain a milk supply.

review/summary: Great to boost supply
review/text: If you have low supply or want to boost supply for pumping and growth spurts, this stuff WORKS. Its effects are almost immediate. If you're nursing + pumping, though, stay with the lower end dosage (3x/day or less) or you could end up with oversupply (and the accompanying host of issues like engorgement and clogged ducts). Flavor is pretty mild--"herby." If you've ever had Chinese herbal tea, it'll taste familiar.

review/text: I have struggled with low milk supply since day one, but have been determined to breastfeed for at least 6 months.  The first three months, this is all I used and had great results.  By no means was I overflowing, but producting enough that I only had to supplement with 1 or 2 oz of formula.  Now I alternate this with fenugreek and blessed thistle (body will get used to one product or another and supply drops).  Although it is a little pricey, it is far cheaper than formula!  Some people complain about the taste, but I have found a little honey goes a long way in helping with that!  I am at month 7 and still nursing!

review/summary: This works well!
review/text: I was a big skeptic- but I have to say this product DOES indeed work! Within 24 hours I noticed a BIG increase in my milk supply. My baby has a shallow latch due to extreme distractability- and due to that was not effectivly emptying my breasts...which meant my body was beginning to produce less milk because of supply and demand. This corrected my low milk supply and also seems to help with boosting a slow letdown into a bit faster one..all of which have made my fussy 4 month old MUCH happier! Now I am using breast compressions and also working on helping her correct her latch to maintain my new supply. I will continue to drink this pleasant tasting tea 3 times per day until she weans herself..which will hopefully be a long ways off. :-)

review/summary: Good for milk, bad for bloat
review/text: I have had no problem producing milk (even in the beginning, when you are deflated because they are drinking every twenty minutes, the next day I would wake up and be good to go), and, after a few weeks, began pumping once a night just so I could have an excess of supply for days she was really hungry, and milk in the freezer just in case.<br />I felt like the breastfeeding superstar.<br />HOWEVER once I got to work at five months, the daycare wanted three five oz. bottles, and my milk wasn't quite at that level.<br />I was so upset; I was afraid I wouldn't be able to make it to six months after all! By my third pumping session, I would really have to work for the last few drops to make five ounces, and felt completely flat for her evening nursing.<br />So, I got Mother's Milk tea. It really does help!<br />I have found, due to the 48-hour supply and demand regimen your body does, Monday and Tuesday I am lacking and need three tea bags (one once I got to work, one after my first pumping session, and one after my second). By Wednesday and Thursday, my supply has picked up and I only do two tea bags. On Friday, just one. Then, because she eats less on the weekends, I have no tea and plenty to pump for my evening pumping session. By Monday, however, I need the help to get all the milk out and revert back to these teas.<br />The taste is easy to adjust to; throw a little milk and sugar in and it helps with the black licorice flavor. The only downside is that I find it tends to bloat me, which I hate. I just get a little extra gassy with it. Other than that; it really does help! Try it and see!

review/summary: WARNING FOR PREEMIE MOMS!!
review/text: My son was born prematurely at 28 weeks.  It was very difficult for me to maintain my milk flow with all the stress, and not being able to hold him, and going back to work with him still in the NICU... so I tried this tea.  It definitely did result in producing more milk but within a week my son began bleeding out of his rectum.  After a million tests, blood tranfusions, and total hysteria for days, we discovered that it was the tea.  The main herbal ingredient is fennugreek, which acts like a natural anticoagulant. I may as well have been doping him up with massive doses of heparin.  Luckily, we figured it out in time.

review/summary: Works Great... Tastes Great too! Awesome AMAZON price!
review/text: I have a 2 week old baby that LOVES to nurse.  He loves to suck I think partly for the comfort of it at times.  I have had an amazing milk flow production so far... however, a few days ago, I felt like I was running low, and I found myself drinking a chamomile vanilla tea about 3 times a day.  I LOVE herbal teas... so I thought, why not drink tea that will actually help with producing more milk.  I have been eyeing this on amazon lately.  I read a lot of reviews about taste, etc.  So I wanted to try it first.  I send my husband to our local organic health food store.  MIND you, he paid about  $8 for ONE box of 16 bags of tea.  I immediately tried some, and I take my tea with honey... and I REALLY liked it.  I was thinking to myself, why others do not like the taste?!  Another thing worth mentioning, I use my Keurig coffee maker to brew the HOT water, in my 16oz Contigo cup. I dont like the idea of a hot cup of tea around my baby without a lid and am paranoid it would burn someone.  I carry my Contigo cup everywhere with me, full of tea.  That said, I only use 1 tea bag in my 16onz cup.  This is double the size they say to use on the box. However, I dont think it is bad... You should drink significantly MORE water when you're nursing.  I actually always have my 30onz cup of ice water.  I do drink this tea before bed, typically 1 to 2 16onz cups.  I drink the same sized cup in the morning when I wake up, and throughout the day I drink it either over ice, or in the hot cup... As I said, I like the taste, and being that I am not going on 3 days drinking this, I can see the difference. If the difference is because of this tea, or just the fact that my son nurses A LOT and my body is making more milk to compensate for that fact, I dont care.  I like the tea and will continue to drink it.  THIS price here is the BEST I have found around.  I subscribed and saved too.<br /><br />I suggest watering down the tea a little if you think it tastes too strong and put some honey in it.  Honey is better than sugar and tastes delicious inside...

review/text: Every woman will react differently to this, so, you really just have to try it to see how it works with your body.<br />I drink about 2-4 cups a day, and take 2 fenugreek pills in the morning, and two at night. This plush the tea help maintain my milk supply without any crazy side effects.<br />Some pointers:<br />1. This tea has a very very strong anise (licorice) taste. If you HATE anise, then this ain't for you.<br />2. I found that adding cinnamon balances the anise. I add non-dairy creamer in the cinnamon bun flavor, and it does the trick. With a little sweetener, it's actually a very yummy tea.<br />3. I was surprised to found that I got A CASE of the tea. You get SIX boxes of 16 tea bags.  Yikes! But, you go through them pretty quick. Buy a box at Whole Foods or Wegman's or some health food store, and if you like it, then buy the case from Amazon.

review/summary: It works for me
review/text: When my son was 13 weeks old, he went on a nursing strike.  Most nursing strikes last about four days.  His lasted 17.  I pumped every two hours, around the clock, for those 17 days.  Despite all of the pumping, I watched my supply dropping in front of my eyes.  No pump is as efficient as a baby, and I was stressed right the heck out--a disastrous combination for milk supply.  As a first time mother and newbie to nursing, I had no idea what to do.  I did some research and started taking a boatload of Fenugreek.  It worked a little bit, maybe.  It didn't do anything dramatic for me.  Then I found Mother's Milk Tea.  Two days was all it took.  I was suddenly able to pump enough to keep up with his demand, and I had never been more relieved in my life, as breast feeding is so important to me.<br /><br />When he came back to the breast, I decided to keep drinking it, because it had been so helpful.  I had been buying it for six bucks a box at the Vitamin Shoppe, but now I buy it in bulk from Amazon.  I actually hate the taste, because I loathe anise, but I brew up three quarts a day, using six Mother's Milk tea bags and four cinnamon apple tea bags (I've also used Wildberry Zinger, but the cinnamon apple is my favorite).  I sweeten it with a bit of honey or agave and drink it iced all day long.  It's actually GOOD this way.  My supply is fantastic now, and I could probably stop drinking it, but it helped so much when I needed it the most that I figure it can't hurt, and now it's helping me build my freezer stash!

review/text: After hearing so many wonderful things about Mothers Milk Tea I decided to try it after my 3rd daughter was born. I started by drinking only 2 cups a day(one in the morning, and one right before bed) In only a few days I was able to pump 8-10 oz of milk a day besides nursing my daughter every 2 hrs. I wasn't sure if it was really the tea because I had started taking it the day after she was born, so I stopped using it for several days. My milk supply dropped and I was only able to pump 2 oz of milk. I started taking the tea again and am once again pumping 8-10 oz a day. Well worth the money!!

I quit all the herbs because it was too much. Yesterday I put 5 of these tea bags in my iced tea maker and drank 3 large glasses. Last night I got a full extra ounce when I pumped. I will drink buckets of this stuff if it works that well. The taste is not great, but I can live with it.<br /><br />Editing review from 4 stars to 5 stars. In one day I noticed an increase. This is day two and the increase is even more significant. I can't believe I had been wasting so much money on all those pills for months when this is what I needed.

review/text: I wasn't sure this tea would really help so I only bought one box the first time, but it definitely helps. So I went back and ordered the 6 pack box which is a much better deal anyway. I was producing about 8oz per session before I started using the tea and now I produce at least 12 oz per session. I wanted to start saving milk for when I go back to work and it truly increased my supply along with drinking plenty of fluids and eating oatmeal.

review/summary: Evaluate your entire lactation profile.
review/text: First of all, I really don't like the flavor of black licorice, but the taste in this tea was not overpowering. I was able to drink it just fine.<br /><br />I was worried about making enough milk to feed my baby and to store for when I returned to work, so I started drinking this tea. I would brew a whole box, stick it in the fridge and sip glasses throughout the day. The box recommends that you drink 3-5 cups per day. So one box (16 bags) will last 3-5 days.<br /><br />I didn't notice a huge change in my milk supply with this product. I drank the tea for about 10 days before my midwife recommended I start fenugreek supplements. I tried fenugreek capsules as well as More Milk Special blend AND I upgraded to hospital grade pump. I noticed a significant increase in the number of dirty diapers my baby made when I started the supplements. However, I did not pump a lot of extra milk until I upgraded my pump.<br /><br />My point is that you really need to evaluate your overall lactation profile (I just made up that term, I don't know if anyone else calls it that.) I recommend the book "The Breastfeeding Mother's Guide to Making More Milk" by Diana West. It covers all the reasons you may not be making enough milk and many strategies on how to tackle your issues. I found it very comprehensive.<br /><br />The tea is not a bad option. I gave it 4 stars because the company doesn't make any promises about milk supply, it tastes alright and the price is right. If you just want a little boost or if you are sensitive to any sort of pharmaceutical (herbs are drugs too!) starting with this tea might be a good option for you. I really think you should also speak to a lactation consultant if you can. Or find a breastfeeding support group in your area.<br /><br />Happy nursing!!

review/summary: Mother's Milk - Mother's Miracle!
review/text: After my son was born prematurely it was too stressful for him and for me to nurse. I have opted to pump my breastmilk and he takes it by bottle.  This tea has been a life saver.  It has been 2 months and I am still able to keep my supply up!  There are times when my supply has been lacking (mostly early evening); as long as I make sure to drink plenty of Mother's Milk tea throughout the day (4 mugs with honey is what I drink) and the evening hours are not as much of a problem.

review/text: it really does work. but you have to keep drinking it! it is very hard to cover the taste. but i think if you are trying to get what is best for your baby... the taste is worth it. at least you can wash you mouth out when you are done.

review/summary: Love this tea!!!
review/text: After getting the stomach flu my first week back to work, my milk production seriously took a plunge to almost nothing. I panicked and contacted my local La Leche League and they told me about this tea. I have to admit I was not wild to hear that it tasted somewhat like licorice since I do NOT like it but optimistic since I didn't want to stop nursing and thankfully with this tea and a tremendous increase in my water intake I am back to normal and now producing more than my precious baby needs. I highly recommend this tea to anyone who needs a boost in production!  Happy Nursing!!!

review/summary: Maybe it helps....
review/text: I am not sure if this tea helped but I know it didn't hurt. I loved the way this tea tastes and my milk production stayed consistent while I used it.  If I stopped drinking it dropped slightly (.5-1.5oz a day)--those were crucial pumping ozs for me to make the 12-15ozs. Needed for my baby at daycare during the 3-6 month stage.  However, I did not see any significant increase--so I'm only giving it three stars.

review/summary: I don't like licorice but I LIKE THIS!!! Good for baby's tummy?
review/text: Well, my milk production was/is fine... the reason I wanted to try this tea is because I was doing research on natural approaches to calming a baby's upset and gassy tummy, and this tea included almost all of the herbs recommended for the breastfeeding mom to induce.<br /><br />My big concern was that I wouldn't be able to tolerate the tea because I've tried licorice tea before and I absolutely couldn't STAND it!!  But something about the blend of herbs they've used in this one makes it not only tolerable, but actually kind of yummy!<br /><br />It's pretty hard to tell what has helped the wee ones tummy, but good tea is good tea so I keep drinking it!  And the case price is AWESOME!

review/text: My husband purchased this for me at Whole Foods when we first got home from the hospital. I make about 6 cups at once, put it in a pitcher and have it ready for me to grab out of the fridge between feedings.  I also eat organic steel cut oats every morning, take mother love pills, drink lots of fluids and eat a lot of food to keep my supply up!

review/summary: Great Flavor, Increased Milk Supply
review/text: The Key is to drink 4-5 8oz servings per day. It increased my supply at least by 3 oz a day if not more. I've tried doing the herb pills like fenugreek and didn't have much success. It took about a week, but once i was drinking this 4-5 times a day I did see an increase. I'd recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: really works
review/text: i use this stuff only when i pump at work. i dont pump at home that often. i drink a cup when i first get to work, then another cup between my next 2 breaks. while using this tea, i always had about 5 extra bottles on hand. my daughter drinks about 5oz at a time.<br /><br />I stopped drinking the tea because I thought it wasn't working. I was expecting to start pumping about 10 oz, but i guess that was unrealistic. Now that I have stopped drinking the tea, i only pump 3 oz on each of my breaks. The same amount I used to pump before I started drinking the tea. Some days I don't even have enough to last her the whole time I'm at work.<br /><br />Long story short....I am going to start drinking the tea again. That way, I will always have 5 extra bottles, and my daughter won't have to starve or drink formula until I get home from work<br /><br />PS...JUST WISH I COULD GET THOSE 10OZ. LOL

review/summary: Seems to be counterfeit
review/text: I bought a 6 pack box since it looks exactly like the one my wife was buying at Whole Foods. but just slightly less expensive. Unfortunately it was the only similarity with the one from Whole Foods. It tastes differently and not as intensive, but the most important is that it doesnot help with the lactation, so after using one pack, we had to come back to Whole Foods and now trying to return remaining 5 packs.

review/summary: This tea has helped SO much!
review/text: I started drinking this tea a few weeks ago when my daughter was about 4 weeks old.  I was worried about my supply.  She was fussy (especially in the evening, which I know is normal, but she seemed very hungry).  I went to a lactation consultant when she was 2 weeks old and found out she had a tongue-tie.  We went to an ENT and got her tongue clipped, but she didn't seem to really learn to nurse correctly and I think she still wasn't drinking enough.  At four weeks I was getting more worried.  A friend heard about this tea from a lactation consultant and recommend this as well as pumping several times a day after feedings to stimulate more production.  I think both the tea and pumping were very helpful.  Now my daughter is 6 weeks and starting to look a bit chubby (so cute!).  She is much less fussy too.  I am pumping only after her 4 AM feed (so just once a day now) because I get extra milk then for my freezer stash.  I borrowed a hospital grade scale from a friend and did test weights before and after feedings for the past 24 hours.  My daughter drank 24 ounces in 22 hours and I pumped 2 extra ounces for the freezer.  I think this is fairly normal for a six week old, but I am so, so happy because this is much more milk than I was making just 2 weeks ago!  I think this tea may also be helping my milk ejection.  My daughter eats so much more quickly now.  In about 15 minutes she takes 3 or 4 ounces.  Weeks ago I did a test weight and she had drunk only .5 ounces in 40 mins.  It is so nice that she is nursing faster!  In short, I highly recommend this tea.  I love the licorise taste and feel it was a major component in increasing my milk supply!

review/text: i'm not sure whether it's the tea or pumping for at least 10 mins religiously after every feeding or lots of liquis including regular tea with half and half for milk thickness. but after several weeks of usinf it, i stopped supplementing with formula. when my baby was about 2 months old, my milk supply decreased by A LOT, he stopped gaining weight and i had to start supplementng wiht formula twice a day, which i wasnt happy about. then i started mothers milk 5 times daily and pumping afer every feeding. in two weeks i only gave him formula once a day. in another three weeks i stopped competely. now my son is four months old and im exclusively breastfeeding him and hoping to be able to continue for a least two more months, preferably longer.

review/summary: Great price...
review/text: This is a great price on this tea. If you are going to buy it, do it here.  This tea DOES work to increase supply and doesn't taste too bad.  It must be brewed properly to be effective.  Be sure to cover the tea while it is brewing, remember this is really a medicine and not a social cup of tea.  And be sure to brew for entire length of time according to package instructions.  I don't have a lot of patience and wasn't brewing the full time period.  Then my husband made a few cups for me according to the directions and my supply really went up! Oh, and I needed to drink at least 4 cups a day. Cheers!
