review/summary: Versatile and Tasty
review/text: I like these for several reasons. One is that they're tasty. Another is that I'm not pouring cold creamer into my hot coffee. Besides, some people don't want creamer, cold nor powdered. Another is that they are easy to pack along in my purse. Another is that I can make flavored iced coffee with them, using milk rather than cream or creamer.<br /><br />I haven't had trouble with opening them, which may be just a difference in technique. I have found it helpful to hold them upside down over my cup and just rip, letting the contents spill into the cup.

I thought wrong.  This is why I feel like I got ripped-off. The Splenda Store has these for $3.95 a box.

review/summary: Organic? Not certified.
review/text: I am not convinced this product is organic and will therefore not buy it again. The packaging on this product leaves me wondering how organic "Healthyway Organic Goji Berry" really is. There is no independent verification authority to confirm that this product is really organic. As far as I can tell, it is not certified organic by any authority other than the supplier and distributor. The 'Nutrition Facts" on the label have some strange entries like "Quantity of Heat" and "Thick Protein" which I do not understand. They sound like direct translations of Chinese to English. It is a "Product of China" as are most goji berries I have seen. My concern at a time when there is so much bad publicity related to food products coming out of China is that this product may be "organic" in name only and not in fact.

review/summary: Not your grandmonther's Marmite
review/text: I am a lifelong Marmite lover but this XO Marmite is in a class by itself and I am completely hooked on it.  The box says it has a "stronger taste" than ordinary Marmite.  I consider that to be somewhat inaccurate.  It is more flavorful rather than stronger tasting.  There's a wonderful tangy taste that is almost (but not quite) fruity and a lot less of the harsh burn that you get with the regular Marmite (e.g. when you spread it too thickly).  If you like to spread your Marmite you should try this.  If you just make drinks or add it to stews, I think the difference is less noticeable.  Buying it here is quite expensive as the seller ships it from England - it's still worth it (but remember I am now addicted to XO).  I hope Unilever makes this a permanent addition to the Marmite product range and that it becomes more readily (and more cheaply) available in the US.

Totally!

review/text: My only complaint is how long it took to ship from the UK to the United States. But, that's not Marmite's fault. I am a recent devotee of Marmite, having only found out about it, and that I could get it here a couple months ago. After devouring 2 bottles of the regular, I had to order this. Man, am I glad I did. I mean Marmite is good, but if I am going to pay a premium for it anyway (125g jar here for $6), then $15 for a jar twice the size, with twice the taste is worth it to me. Thanks for making this available to me.

Disappointed that was offered for $16.99 and eligible for Prime Shipping only day before I ordered but then when went to check out next day was $22.99. It's not a great deal since can ordered on several other sites, even on Marmite site for much less including shipping from U.K. Maybe they'll decide to add on subscribe and save in 2 pack at better original rate. They'll sell much more that way!

review/text: If you even like this product...the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top. I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking. It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't. With the sweetness of the fig, a bit more acidity would have balanced it out. I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable. I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help. It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months. I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain. I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste. Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store. I asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller. I can see why.

review/summary: Amazing, Utterly Amazing... Just Pure Chocolatey, Peanutty, Nougatty Heaven!
review/text: I have been eating Oh Henry! bars ever since my late teens ( I'm 33 now ) and they are by far my favorite chocolate bar in the entire world!  They used to sell these wonderful chocolate bars at my local Walgreen's but for some reason they stopped carrying them at all the stores in my area so I went to search for them on Amazon and here they were!  I was a little hesitant to purchase them at first because of the price but then I did price comparisons on the Internet and I figured that it was cheaper to buy them here than anywhere else, including many of those so-called " candy " stores that charge you and arm and a leg for the old classic candy bars you grew up loving.<br />  Oh Henry! bars themselves taste unlike any other chocolate bar ont he market.  While not unlike a Snickers bar or a Baby Ruth bar in the way the peanuts crunch while you're chewing it in your mouth, the chocolate is better made, more mild and less sweet than a snickers bar and not as rich or as sweet as a Baby Ruth bar.  These bars are made by the famous Nestle company based out of Switzerland ( who also make baby Ruth ) bars and Nestle is a fine chocolate-maker, I'll give them that one for sure!  In fact, to me Oh Henry bars are not unlike a piece of candy you'd buy freshly made at a See's Candies store or something like that.  Fresh, aromatic, crunchy and just plain good.  I FEEL SO SORRY for the Amazon customer whose box of Oh Henry! bars came old and expired cos mine were fresh, chewy and just plain good.  I have already eaten 7 packages and I don't plan to eat anymore for a while but I know when I need to order another box ( which will be soon, you can bet on that ) Amazon.com is the place to go for them.  Also try Goo Goo Clusters Sumpreme if you like Oh Henry bars, they are a chocolate bar made by a candy company based out of Tennessee who produce a superior chocolate candy bar.  Well done Nestle, and thanks again Amazon!  UPDATE:  March 24th, 2011:  I HAVE ORDERED 3 MORE BOXES OF THESE AMAZING CHOCOLATE BARS SINCE THE TIME OF THE WRITING, THE MOST RECENT ON FEBRUARY 21st, 2011.  SAME CONSISTENT QUALITY, SAME GREAT TASTE, EVERYTHING AMAZING!  YOU CAN'T GO WRONG HERE, PEOPLE!!!

The bars were fresh and just as I remember the Oh Henry! candy bars from years ago. I introduced them to my Grandkids who had never seen them before and they loved them too. So I will definately be ordering more! I don't know why they are not distributed in stores anymore, but as long as they keep making them i'll keep buying them!

Thank you for having a product that is not available everywhere!

Very satisfied with the purchase, and I will be re-ordering when this box has been devoured!

review/text: I called the number on the package and was told the case of Oh Henry bars I bought from Amazon was<br />out of date and that I should return them for a refund. When I find what looks like a deal it's NOT, amazon is trying<br />top dispose of old stock passing it on to the customer. Is this any way to treat good customers? I spend hundreds of dollars at Amazon and most of the time am happy but this is uncalled for. I also ordered some batteries and they too were at the end of the 6 year freshness date.

review/summary: Still the best
review/text: The Oh Henry remains the single best standard (medium track) candy bar available in the US.  Indeed, I would argue North America as a whole, although I do respect the advocates of the Aero.  While we're on the subject of Canadian candy bars, you should be aware that the Canadian Oh Henry bar is actually manufactured and distributed by Hershey, not Nestle; although I have a fondness for the Hersey company, once having worked near their original factory in Pennsylvania, both are now reputable companies, in contrast to some others I won't name.<br /><br />I think part of the glory of the O.H. is the simplicity which has allowed it to work as a combination even with the inevitable pressure to cheapen ingredients and chemicalize.  American candy as a whole has been hurt by this sort of cheapening, and I think this most affects wafers.  I understand that wafer based bars (like Kit Kat) are very popular, because the crisp wafer can be a vehicle to hold some of the sugar apart from the thicker ingredients, and so it gives a sparkle when you first bite in, but given that most of the caramel type fillers are corn syrup with very simple flavorings, and the quality of most wafer if you taste it on its own is pretty low, I think it makes sense to go for something with nuts--most peanuts stay peanuts no matter what.<br /><br />Further, and I'm not pointing fingers, I would have some concerns about cleanliness at any place that is using a lot of wafer, because unless flour storage is done in a satisfactory manner, you can find that the stocks are contaminated by various forms of fungal or animal life.  That wouldn't happen at a great firm like Nestle's, but that doesn't mean it can't happen elsewhere.  Having once had a foot in the larger business, I've become more cautious--still love the great Oh Henry bar! [4]

review/summary: Gave my son back his Valentine's Day fun...
review/text: Valentine's Day is the hardest day of the year for my 9-year-old. He has a sensitivity to red dye 40. Almost all the candy you buy has it in it. M&Ms have it - IN THE CHOCOLATE. Most chocolate cake mixes have it, but worse... all that red candy you get from your classmates? Yeah... it has it too. Luckily, his sister will usually trade him for things that he can have and the families that we know will try to make sure he gets something (like one specifically got green fun dip for him - I mean, how sweet is that?). We always give away little party favor toys or something and skip the candy all together, but...<br /><br />He had been really down about the candy issue and Valentine's Day and I went looking for something he could have. Surely, there's a red hard candy that doesn't have red40 in it, right? Yeah, you'd be surprised... it's not easy to find, but I ran across this product and ordered it. As a bonus, it has a good chunk of Vitamin C, doesn't use HFCS (all natural sugars and other ingredients). Sold! But, will it be nasty? Oh well, we had 150 lollipops to find out!<br /><br />... and they are good. REALLY good, they are just the right amount of sweet and tartness. I had to move them off the counter because I kept dipping in there myself. My son LOVES them. He can have strawberry flavored candy again. I know this sounds simplistic and overly dramatic, but when you are 9, it can be really depressing. But yeah, he has to share with the rest of the family too because we are all hooked.<br /><br />Thanks, YummyEarth. Thanks for giving my son back his Valentine's Day :)<br /><br />Note: The container we got only had 3 flavors in it, but it didn't matter, but be aware when ordering that your selection of flavors will vary.

review/text: My son was diagnosed with many food allergies over the summer. These have been a lifesaver for us, as they are the only candy he can have. Literally. He can't have chocolate, because that has milk (although we recommend the Enjoy Life chocolate chips) and everything that's not chocolate has some form of corn in it. My son is also allergic to corn.<br /><br />All of my kids love these candy, so they are for everyone. Not just one with allergies. The one they fight over the most is the root beer flavored drops. I hope they start making that flavor in a sucker, also, but they are happy with the drops, too.

review/summary: Great lollipops, but not exactly as described.
review/text: I have no complaints about the lollipops themselves. They're about the size of a stack of 3 quarters, taste sweet & fruity with just a little bit of tartness, and are individually packaged nicely on a paper stick. All have natural coloring, so they don't stain as other lollipops would (I NEVER give my daughter anything with blue coloring.)<br /><br />I ordered these directly from amazon.com (not an outside party) & didn't receive the flavor assortment as described on the webpage. I got a tub of 150 lollipops, but only 3 flavors: razzmatazz berry, tooberry blueberry (not blue at all, reddish in color), & strawberry smash. Fortunately for me, I (& my daughter) love all the flavors & would have picked these flavors myself if purchasing the lollipops in a store. But, I had no way of knowing this & probably would have been very upset if I had received a citrus assortment or something different.<br /><br />Again, the lollipops are great, but the description should be more accurate.

review/summary: Yummy pops that I feel good about eating
review/text: I bought a small bag of these pops for my toddler son at a local store before a recent vacation because I thought they would be good for him to suck on in flight. But to my surprise, we have found a treat the whole family loves and ingredients that I am not afraid to feed my family. Since then we have bought this bin off Amazon because it was such a good price with the Subscribe and Save.<br />The pops are all natural and delicious. There are no artificial dyes or flavors. They are flavored with 100% natural colors and 100% real fruit extracts like Acerola Berry, Black Carrots, Black Currants, Apple, Carrot and Pumpkin. All certified organic. No corn syrup, gmo-free, soy-free, gluten-free, dairy-free and nut-free. The 3 flavors (Razzmatazz Berry, Tooberry Blueberry and Very Very Cherry) are all very tasty.<br />We highly recommend these pops. Great for anyone with food sensitivities or allergies or who just wants to eat foods free of yucky chemicals, pesticides and dyes.

Upon first taste it was...different.  Then the full flavor and sweetness hit and it was enjoyable.  After about 6 times of sucking on it, the full intensity of the flavor came out and I was hooked!  They are the best I've tasted.

review/summary: Awesome little lollipops!
review/text: These taste great and I love that we get vitamin C from them.  We bought these because our son loves going to the bank with Daddy on Saturdays but we didn't like giving him the junk lollipops the bank tellers hand out there.  Now DS goes to the bank with DH and instead of getting a lollipop full of junk and artificial dyes, DH hands him one of these out of the console.  Because they are made with organic ingredients and vitamin C added in, we don't have to feel bad about giving him candy.  DS thinks he's getting a treat and we feel good about it.

review/summary: Buyer Beware of Flavor Changes Not Accurately Described
review/text: I just bought the Yummy Earth Vitamin C pops 30 oz container as both Halloween candy and for myself to enjoy. The item flavor description is different than the flavors I received. So, just be aware that this might be the case before you buy.<br /><br />I find it completely ridiculous to just notice that someone negatively reviewed this problem 11 MONTHS ago, and they STILL have not corrected the problem! Get on the ball, Amazon and Yummy Earth!<br /><br />It states that the lollis are currently, "Razzmatazz Berry, Tooberry Blueberry, Strawberry Smash", AND then a, "Mix of sour apple tart, pomegranate pucker, mango tango, tooberry blueberry, googly grape, strawberry smash, very very cherry, wet-face watermelon." ??? This is both confusing and inaccurate. I didn't even notice the "Razzmatazz Berry, Tooberry Blueberry, Strawberry Smash" part when I ordered them, I just assumed it would be the latter, old assorted mix I've been ordering for the last 2 years. In any case, neither flavor description ended up being correct. What I actually received was just 3 flavors: "Tooberry Blueberry, Razzmatazz Berry and Very Cherry". I don't like any of those flavors, so it was definitely disappointing.<br /><br />You can't return grocery items, which is another hassle, but I called customer service and they were nice about sending me a completely new container for free supposedly containing the original variety assortment. Still, it seems like bad business and an unnecessary hassle; just get the description right -- so we know up front what we will be actually buying! If they have to replace enough inaccurate orders and lose money on them, maybe that'll be the final catalyst they need to change! So, hey! Extra free Halloween candy! Order away! I'll take this down when they accurately, finally update their description...

review/text: I always get excited whenever I see organicly made candy. Candy you wouldn't feel guilty eating or giving to children. However, I was shocked to see it was made in Mexico. Not only that, but it has a ton of sugar. I want candy that isn't made in a 3rd world country, organic, and has little sugar and more natural sweeteners like Xylitol.

review/summary: Misleading about ingredients
review/text: I first purchased this product because I love the flavored oatmeal that Quaker makes, but found the packets too sweet for my taste and too high of a sugar content for a healthier diet. I was really excited to find the lower sugar instant oatmeal until I noticed that they contain artificial sweeteners to compensate for the reduced sugar. As someone who deliberately avoids "low fat" and "diet" products to keep artificial sweeteners out of my body, it made me mad that they did not make it more clear that this was not a less sweet version of their product, but simply an artificially sweetened one. I just feel that people should be properly warned that the food they are purchasing contains chemical sweeteners, and wanted to let anyone thinking of purchasing this know. If you don't mind artificial sweeteners, then enjoy!

review/summary: My Breakfast Every Morning...
review/text: This variety pack, as well as the fruit version (Lower Sugar Peaches & Cream and Strawberries & Cream) are in my desk.  I make a packet every morning when I get to work.  It takes about 15 seconds to prepare (we have a hot water dispenser so I don't need the microwave). It's the perfect breakfast in this respect.<br /><br />This stuff is great. Half the sugar of the "normal" version, but still tasty.  My favorite of the three is the Apples and Cinnamon, but I don't dislike any of them.  The important thing is that they taste just like I remember the "normal" variety tasting, although it's been years since I've had those. If I did a side-by-side comparison, I don't know how it would turn out.<br /><br />Anyway, it's good. Get it. :)

review/summary: "Weight Control" may be the better option
review/text: After comparing the weight control version at the store to the lower sugar variety, in many ways you are better off eating the weight control variety. For the Maple and Brown sugar variety and the Cinnamon Sugar variety there is actually less sugar in the weight control formula. Another issue I have is when I add the recommended 1/2 cup per packet, it is usually too much water so pour slowly and stir when you are doing.<br /><br />That being said I try to start off every day with 2 packets of quaker instant oatmeal, with cut up apples in it! It is quick easy and good for you!

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I like the lower sugar version because I don't normally add any sugar to my cereal. One time I went to visit an older cousin and her five children. She put more sugar on the oatmeal than I put on a whole month's worth of oatmeal breakfasts. She made a separate bowl and saw how much I put on. She was shocked as to how little I put on...maybe a half a teaspoon for the whole bowl at the most. I'm just not a sugar eater when it comes to any kind hot or cold cereal.<br /><br />My favorite flavor is cinnamon and spice. But..there is only two packets of that flavor in the box. I'm not a real big fan of maple sugar and there are four of those in the box. The apple and cinnamon flavor is ok and there are four of those also. But..I'd like to find more of the lower sugar variety of Quaker Oatmeal in cinnamon and spice flavor. I looked on the web and there isn't any place that has just lower sugar cinnamon and spice Quaker oatmeal in it's own box. I found the regular version...but not the lower sugar version...in its own box. For that reason I only gave it four stars.

review/summary: Quaker Instant Oatmeal - Lower Sugar
review/text: I eat this almost every morning at the office.  I like every flavor that comes in the package and enjoy sticking my hand in the box and pulling out a random flavor to enjoy that day.  I started eating the lower sugar version of instant oatmeal because my office-mate complained about the strong smell of the original (and I was on a bit of a health kick at the time).  I now prefer the lower sugar version and the original stuff is just too sweet.<br /><br />Overall, the product is great and Amazon's price for subscribing was better than what I could get at my local grocery store.  I admit I could probably find it for cheaper if I searched for it but the convenience of buying in bulk and not worrying about it on the grocery list makes it a winning choice.

review/text: Every year I look forward to fall and winter in New England, in part because it means I can eat oatmeal again - and it's seasonally appropriate!  I'm not a fan of mess or preparation time, so "old fashioned" oats are not an option.  When I discovered a lower sugar version of a favorite childhood breakfast item - Quaker oatmeal packets - I was STOKED!<br /><br />These taste nearly identical to the "full sugar" variety, just a tad less sweet. ("Lower sugar" - imagine!) The first time I had them - and to be honest, the first time I have them every season - I do have a slight memory of the full-on version, but two bites in and I've forgotten about that.  These are delicious, satisfying, and I feel a bit better about the bit less sugar (and calories) that I'm putting in my body.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan - and going to eat some now!

review/summary: Excellent for adults who want to reduce sugar intake
review/text: I purchased this primarily as breakfast for my girlfriend, who is under strict orders from her doctor to get her sugar intake down. This is always a challenge, since she detests artificial sweeteners. As a compromise strategy, this product succeeds very well. As the boxes clearly explain, the normal sugar content for Quaker Oats cereal is 11-12 grams per packet. This product has a third of that (except for the apples and cinnamon flavor, which is half). An artificial sweetener, sucralose, makes up for any lost sweetness.<br /><br />Some reviewers mark this product down for misrepresentation. The product's packaging is actually quite clear and explicit about the ingredients, and while Amazon presents less information, I had a pretty good idea of what I was getting.<br /><br />As far as my girlfriend, she loves this stuff. She was practically ripping open the boxes before I even had a chance to unpack and organize things. Each flavor is very distinctly sweet, but not cloyingly so. The oatmeal is pleasingly coarse rather than creamy or mushy. The flavors are correct. I'm not a fan of oatmeal, and I still plan on getting more just for myself.<br /><br />Each packet is suitable for a child. We use two packets each for breakfast. That means the bundle of four boxes contains about 24 adult meals. Be sure to heat the water or milk sufficiently in making this. Otherwise, the oatmeal won't soak up the liquid, and it will be too goopy.<br /><br />So far as the rating...well, the one-star reviewers (only 2 of 5 of whom are verified Amazon purchasers) have made their point, but this is not a one-star product. It's a quality four or five-star product, and a great deal under Amazon's subscription plan.

review/text: I roast my own coffee at home, not commercially, just for my family, and for a church ministry called Celebrate Recovery which requires coffee for 50 people weekly. Sometimes it rains or I get behind on the roasting, so for backup I use Coffee Masters. I discovered their use at another church which goes through lots of coffee. I cannot honestly say that any coffee is as good as home roasted coffee, but Coffee Masters is close. Almost all their flavors are good, this particular one is a favorite of our people especially when blended with a good Bolivian brew. It is a very strong flavor, and you may like it straight, but if not, consider blending it with a normal coffee and you may have just the right flavor. I only give it 4 stars because of this home roasting bias that I have; others might give them another star.
