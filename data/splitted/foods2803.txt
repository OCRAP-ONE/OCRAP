review/text: These are great, but I read horror stories about dogs choking or being unable to digest it so I have decided not to give them to my dog anymore. However, there was an article indicating that they changed the ingredients so that there wouldn't be a choking hazard, but I would rather be safe than sorry.

review/summary: Our dogs will do ANYTHING for a Greenie
review/text: I have 2 small terriers who aren't really interested in any kind of dog toys (except rawhide ones, which they choke on) but they LOVE Greenies.  I can get them to do almost anything if I mention "Greenie".  I do wish Greenies were a little harder.  The dogs polish them off so quickly that I don't think they really are helping clean the teeth very well.

review/text: My medium sized dog will not chew rubber bones.  So I bought greenies hoping the chewing would help keep her teeth clean.<br />she is overweight so I don't give her extra treats during the day.  Unfortunately the Greenies are not as hard as I thought, she is able to bite off and swallow the pieces within a minute or two.

review/summary: My dogs go crazy for these
review/text: Heaven forbid that I should run out of these, so I usually order more than one box at the time. My dogs are small, so I always buy the LITE Teenie Greenies. My dogs love these so much they will do anything I ask them to do just to get one. They will come to me when I call them, no matter where they are, if they think they'll get a greenie reward. I give each one of my two little dogs a greenie everynight before their bedtime, and they know the routine so well till one of them runs to her bed and actually opens up her kennel door with her paws, then climbs in and waits for her greenie. I have never seen a dog yet who did not love greenies.  Even my almost toothless fourteen year old schnauzer loves her some greenies.

review/text: Greenies are a great product that dogs love and while they are enjoying their daily treat, they are actually keeping their teeth  and gums clean.  I always share the information on Greenies when people ask how I keep my 6 year old Yellow Labradors teeth so clean.  I'd always thought they were a bit expensive but Amazon has brought them to us at a more affordable price.  We have chosen the lite variety to keep our lab a bit trimmer in weight.  A good product at a reasonable price....Thanks

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised...
review/text: Being an American, I think it is easy to not notice the treasure in your own backyard.<br /><br />I like coffee from Nordstroms and I didn't know what kind of coffee that was, except that it comes from Seattle.  I also like Carribou and can not stomach Starbucks.  I found that the Nabob Columbian from Canada rivals the Nordstrom cup extremely well. I was also suprised that the Maxwell House House Blend does the same thing.  You get 14 Nabob pods in a single pack and 16 Maxwell House.  I give this coffee 5 stars for the pleasant suprise in taste, convenience, and for the economics (Maxwell House brews a slightly larger cup than Nabob and is sold on Amazon with Holiday discounts).  Nabob is a richer, possibly more elegant brew, but for convenience I would grab the Maxwell House.  This leads me to believe, the Maxwell house espresso may also be good for my taste.<br /><br />My uncle retired from Maxwell House and they swear by the coffee.  So, if Canada believes in Nabob, I think Americans can support Maxwell House with the same pride.<br /><br />Gevalia makes a great Latte - golden, rich and creamy.  I prefer their latte over cappuccino because the cap has a stronger espresso brew and seems more skim than the latte - more froth in the cap though.  The cap is more chocolaty with a bite than creamy like the latte.  Gevalia Signature Blend coffee is too bitter for my palette.  Whatever your taste in coffee, I do think that it will be brewed to accuracy with Tassimo.  Just find your niche'.  If you like rich and aromatic, with little to no aftertaste, go for Maxhouse.  It you like it a little more rich and pleasantly aromatic with less in your cup, go to Tassimo Direct and get Nabob.<br /><br />This review is meant to support Maxwell House, Nabob, and the Gevalia Latte.  It should appeal to lightweight drinkers like me who prefer creamy, rich, and pleasant coffee that does not need to keep you awake to be considered good.  Although, the Gevalia Cap kept me up to 3:00am the first time I drank it.  I also scored over 1300 points on my daughters DS Lite/Big Brain Academy after drinking that thing.<br /><br />P.S.  I tried Seattle's Best, and no...not for my style.  But, none of the coffees are bad and they all brew perfectly.  I have tried the Gevalia espresso, I thought it was too bitter with no crema.  I am not an espresso drinker, so I didn't know what to look for.  I want to sample the 3 other espressos from Tassimo to see if others are more pleasant.  I am doing this only to see if I could recommend this machine to a true espresso drinker.

review/text: This flavor tastes so decadent! It leans to the tangerine side but there is just a hint of strawberry that tames the citrus to keep it from being too acidic. I buy these through the Subscribe and Save program so I save money and never run out. There are five tubs per canister and 6 canister per order. That makes 15 gallons. Not bad for the price at all. I mix two of the tubs into a gallon jug of drinking or spring water, shake away, and throw it in the fridge. Simply fantastic. Sometimes I use one tub of the Red Grapefruit flavor and one of these to make a nice citrus punch. I'm going to try it with the natural lemonade flavor next to see if can tame a bit of the acidity from the lemon flavor. I sure hope they don't stop making this variety.

review/text: Crystal Light Tangerine Strawberry does not taste like a diet drink. We go through three or four gallons of it every week. It tastes almost like juice; it does NOT have the "too thin" flavor of other Crystal Light varieties, and there is virtually no aftertaste.<br />This is the best product for someone who hates "diet" drinks and artificial sweeteners. The only problem with this product, as I write this review, is that Amazon is out of it... and Kraft Foods no longer shows it on the Crystal Light Web site.<br /><br />I haven't seen Crystal Light Tangerine Strawberry in stores for about two years; Amazon was the only reliable source of it. Let's hope it isn't gone for good.

review/text: If you are used to sugar-free and other diet drinks, I think you will find this flavor to be overly sweet.  My husband loves it, but I can not stomach it.<br /><br />However, if you are new to sugar-free drinks, this is probably a great place for you to start.

review/text: I would say that these are just as good, if not better, than Teddy Grahams. Even better, they are trans-fat free (Teddy Grahams are not). I'd highly recommend these delicious snack cookies!!<br /><br />FYI: my local Target carries them for 1.99 a box (on sale) or ~2.39 regular priced...that's cheaper than what Amazon has here (currently 19 something dollars for 6 boxes). Check your local stores to see what their prices are first!

review/summary: Suspicious taste
review/text: I have tried dozens of these packets of snacks over the past 3 years.  Various flavors from various lots.  Some of them a while back tasted fine.  Lately, all I get are ones with a bitter, rancid taste.  Especially on the Friends variety.  Does "all natural" mean "High in THC"?<br />What is up with that sharp nasty taste?  These things aren't expired.  I've communicated with Annie's on numerous occasions and have always recieved coupons for more, but I've given up on ever finding another lot of this product that doesn't taste gross.  My kids won't even eat them anymore.  Its like they are all rancid or something.

review/summary: Teddy Graham's Competition
review/text: I wanted to try these as a slightly healthier alternative to Teddy Grahams.  These are organic and have a few less ingredients.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />With three flavors of "bunnies" you get a medley that is kind of nice.  However, only the chocolate ones have enough flavor to even compare to a Teddy Graham.  The chocolate chip has a very, very mild chocolate flavor, but isn't too bad.  The honey flavor is pretty bland.  Honey Teddy Grahams have more flavor, so I'd choose them over plain honey bunnies.<br /><br />TEXTURE:<br />These bunnies get stale very fast.  Seal them up well, or you'll have bad tasting bunnies.  Fresh, they're crispy and crunchy and a great size for on-the-go snacking or sitting at your computer with a cup of coffee and these little cookies.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION<br />I do like the organic factor.  However, they're generally a little more money than their competing Teddies, and I like Teddy flavor better.  It's up to you and your taste buds, but I would at least recommend trying the bunnies.  I buy them when they're on sale for cheaper than Teddies.

review/summary: Not just for kids......these are tasty!
review/text: Ok, I have to say, the packaging did draw me in... I mean, how could the little hippy bunny flashing you a peace sign steer you wrong?  So I picked up the box...organic, I like that, 8 grams of sugar, I can live with that, no trans or saturated fats, 20% calcium, 2 grams of fiber, and I can have 28 little cookies (a combo of chocolate, honey & chocolate chip) for 130 calories.  So, the bunnies and I went home together....<br /><br />These are my favorite little cookies when I want something sweet but don't want to obliterate all the good eating that I did all day.  Yeah, they are a cookie, but I felt good that I could eat organic and that there were no additives or preservatives.  I like to keep mine in the fridge where they stay nice and cold and crunchy and just wait for me to pair it with a glass of milk.<br /><br />Great snack for the little ones as well as those of us who are young at heart!

review/text: These are FABULOUS.  I was introduced to them by a friend and I can't wait to try all the different varieties.  These go for $2.99 at Earth Fare, so they're not that expensive, especially for how much is in the box!  I know 7.5 ounces doesn't sound like that much, but I emptied the entire box into a ziploc bag, and I've been snacking on them for the past 3 days and I still haven't made a dent!  Although, I don't have kids and I won't share with my husband, so that could be why :-)  Seriously, give these a try - you will NOT be disappointed.

review/summary: Delicious and great for kids!
review/text: In my ongoing effort to provide healthy snacks to the children in my son's class (he goes to a public elementary school), I try various organic finger foods. One of the things that has boggled my mind is the amount of graham crackers that contain trans fat- and they are marketed as healthy! When I saw these, I was pleasantly surprised- I didn't imagine I'd see an organic AND trans fat free graham cracker product.<br /><br />Not only are these free of trans fats AND high fructose corn syrup (which is typical of organic products, thankfully) but they are absolutely delicious. I love snacking on them and the kids in my son's class loved them! I went ahead and used the subscribe-and-save feature for this product and now his class has a steady supply of healthy and yummy snacks. :)

review/summary: Mylar balloon flavored graham crackers.
review/text: I am a fan of this brand, but was extremely disappointed when I tried the Bunny Graham Friends. I noticed immediately upon opening the brand new box that there was a strange odor. I proceeded to open the metallic bag, and almost instantly correlated the smell with that of a mylar balloon (those metallic helium balloons). Sadly, the graham snacks were impregnated with the smell and taste as well. I'm all for "green" packaging and such, and realize the hidden dangers of plastic packaging, but surely there is another way to package these without ruining the flavor or earth. I will, however, continue to buy the macaroni and other products from this line, but I will never waste my money on this item again.

review/summary: Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/summary: Totally the best of the lower-carb, higher fiber pastas--tastes like regular, but doesn't give me the sleepies
review/text: I've been using Dreamfields pasta for about a year and a half now. It's become a kitchen staple for us. I bought it to help keep my sugar under control while still enjoying pasta dishes. My husband, a very finicky eater, didn't even notice it was high-fiber (well, until he got a bit gassy later). Tastewise, this is just as good as regular, quality pasta. (And not gritty like whole wheat ones can be.)<br /><br />A very nice product, and a boon to those watching their sugar numbers. I'll add that I don't get the super-sleepiness after eating this pasta that I used to eating regular pasta (you know, that post-carb napping syndrome).<br /><br />I've used the penne, the linguine, the elbow (for mac'n'cheese and in soups) and the lasagna (for veggie and regular lasagne casseroles). Great. All of them.<br /><br />Thumbs up.

review/summary: Godsend for low carber-pasta addicts like me!
review/text: I have a real problem with simple carbs like pasta. I retain water, getting sleepy, can't concentrate, and feel miserable even with small amounts that most people can tolerate. But I love pasta! Isn't that the way it always seems to work! Anyway, I can't stand the texture of whole wheat pasta, so I've been doing without until I discovered Dreamfields. This product tastes EXACTLY like full wheat pasta but without the high carbs! It's a miracle! I trust the net carb calculations on the label (5 gms per serving NET) because my body does not react to this pasta like it does the regular stuff. I'm telling you, I've served this brand to my husband and he NEVER knew the difference. I can only get spaghetti and penne locally, so even though it costs more, I have to go online to buy my favorites - elbow, rigatoni, and lasagne. Buying by the case at Amazon is cheaper than anywhere else, especially with no S&H. I hope they get the rigatoni back in stock soon. But if not, I'll enjoy my elbow pastas salads, mac and cheese, goulash, and what ever else tickles my tongue's fancy until they do. YUMMY!

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I had been eating whole wheat pastas, which are okay, but recent reading convinced me that even whole wheat provides too many carbs.<br /><br />I was skeptical about Dreamfields, so I bought one box at my local market. I made macaroni and cheese with it and I couldn't tell the difference between it and regular pasta, even plain.<br /><br />I love the fact that it has low net carbs. I don't do Atkins, but I try to keep my simple carbs low because there is type II diabetes in my family and I'd just as soon avoid that. There certainly isn't anything wrong with avoiding simple carbs whenever possible.<br /><br />A caveat: Do NOT overeat this pasta or you will regret it. I heard an interview with the president of Dreamfields & he said that the serving size is THE serving size and overeating the pasta can lead to nasty gastro effects and my hubby can tell you that's true :). They also emphasize that the pasta should not be overcooked. I just undercook it before making my stovetop M&C, so that's not an issue. Be sure to always cook al dente.<br /><br />It's definitely nice to be able to include pasta in my repetoire of recipes again!

review/summary: Doesn't get any better than this
review/text: At 13 weeks into my pregnancy I found out I had gestational diabetes.  For 3 weeks I was on a severely strict extremely low carb diet, in hopes that it would be managed.  Unfortunately this was not the case and I was put on insulin.  Even with high doses of insulin that I am currently taking (I am now 8 months along) even some foods that are approved on my diet cause my blood sugar levels to spike.  If you have ever been on a very strict diet, you know how boring and tedious it can get because of eating the same foods over and over and seeing others eat your favorite foods while you look on in envy.  Then I happened to watch an old episode of Unwrapped on the Food Network and they did a piece on this pasta.  I was skeptical at first, who wouldn't be? But in desperation I decided to order a case of the elbow macaroni and kept my fingers crossed.  My first meal with this pasta was homemade mac and cheese.  I closed my eyes and prayed to the food gods as I took my first bite.  I was not disappointed.  In fact, I was in shock.  It tasted great, in fact, it tasted like high quality pasta. My husband scarfed down his plate in record time (having not been allowed pasta in our house for about 5 months he was almost as desperate as I was).  When I told him it was low carb pasta he scoffed and thought I was joking, but then realized I wouldn't have eaten it if it was regular pasta.  So then he tells me that ok, yes, it tasted great, but my blood sugar numbers were sure to spike really high.  I was worried about that too, but we were both wrong.  After testing my blood sugar, my numbers were even with what they had been, it was the same as if I had eaten a salad. We have not noticed any ill side effects some of the other reviewers have described, and we eat at least 2 pasta meals each week now.  I could not be happier with this product and will continue to purchase even after I have the baby because of how good it is for you.  My friends and family have all had dishes I have made with this pasta and no one ever could tell it was not 'real' pasta and I got rave reviews for how amazing everything tasted.  I would recommend this to anyone.

Dreamfields works in soups, with spagetti sauce, etc. It cooks fast and gets limp if overcooked, similar to "regular" pasta.<br /><br />The soy pastas I've had tend to be rubbery and not very tasty, (plus they give me gas).<br /><br />I remember when they had Dreamfields in the grocery store I was put off by the 41 grams of Carbs on the label. But I think they are right when they list it as low carb. I don't test my blood sugar, but my body reacts when I eat a lot of carbs and this pasta doesn't give me that reaction.<br /><br />I like that it has apple pectin as part of the fiber profile. This is a great fiber, healing for the gut, and very expensive to buy as a supplement.<br /><br />Since I don't see this on the grocery shelf anymore I hope they are not phasing it out. Glad I tried it.

Will not buy here again as it's only $2.49 at local grocery and often on sale at $2.00 a box.  Not sure how price jump of more than 50% here at Amazon can be justified.

review/summary: Simply Great
review/text: Been chomping a lot on these yummy flax crackers lately... and they are really good aside from being good for you.  The only carbs in these are soluble fiber from the flax, which is soaked and then lo-temp dehydrated along with veggies and sea salt to form the final cracker.<br /><br />This flavour (Mexican Harvest) is the best I've tried so far... I've also tried the Italian, and that is far more subtle.  The texture is very crunchy and dry... it's good to drink a lot more water when eating these.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these crackers again, will get more Mexican and try the Maple next time as well.  Health-wise and taste-wise, can't beat 'em.

review/summary: Taste isn't the only thing this snack has going for it
review/text: I don't consider myself a raw foodist. However, when it's late at night and I want something healthy that packs flavor, nutrition, fiber, protein, and low carbs all in one package. Then these crackers are the one I turn to. In fact, I'm eating them right now as I write this review.<br /><br />Fair warning: Don't expect the same concentrated flavors you'd get from your favorite chips. Let's be real, these are flaxseeds and because they are flaxseeds, their hard exterior makes it difficult to hold a lot of spices. But it has enough flavor to satisfy in my opinion.<br /><br />These crackers will appeal to those who are already maintaining a healthy diet, or those whose palates are accustomed to "health foods." I'm not saying a junk food addict couldn't enjoy this snack, but it's highly unlikely.<br /><br />Anyway, Amazon has the best prices so far so go ahead and splurge.

review/text: These crackers are great.  I think they are the best low-carb cracker option.  However, the dried flax does seem to get stuck in your teeth, not the seeds like you would think, rather the munched up cracker.  Eating them with something helps.  I still think this is a great way to eat flax, I've not found any realy good way to use the ground seed.

These crackers were great because they are premade yet very healthy and were as good as the ones I made homemade.  The flavor is strong but a nice change from a diet that can at times be a little bland.  I highly recommend these for any one who is health conscious and looking for a snack on the go.

And I was surprised how good the tea is!<br />Now, I like my tea best in England and I can't stand Lipton's version of black tea, just to give you an idea of what kind of tea I like.<br />For my morning tea, these pods are awesome, quickly brewed and full-bodied. A little bit pricy, but what pods aren't?<br />If you're serving afternoon tea, it would take forever, these you use for one cup at a time that's always fresh.

Then as I go up to the check-out area, I pass by a beverage display and, quite often, I try one of their exotic drinks to have with my meal. This evening I chose Cascal Fermented Soda (tropical), a natural soft drink. The flavor is from mango, jasmine and kaffir lime and is slightly fermented. It's quite good. Nice fresh flavor. Only slightly sweet, which I prefer. It's low on sugar and the calories are quite modest (80 for a 12-ounce can. I'm glad I tried it. I'll be back.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

No its not but for someone on atkins or another low carb diet it does fill that void. You have to think of it as more of ketchup in a salsa form...it takes a few time to get used to..the consistency....it is more like a seasoned tomato soup...once you get used to it being its own flavor then you will be fine. The BBQ sauces from this company is AWESOME!!!

review/summary: not bad as a low carb ketchup
review/text: I tried this a number of years ago and did not like it. I don't know if my tastes have changed over the years or it has been reformulated but I started using it again about 3 years ago and have been using it ever since on a regular basis. I get it at a local grocery store. The last time I think it was about $4 a bottle. I probably use a bottle every couple of months.<br /><br />The texture takes some getting used to. I suspect it is hard to get the typical ketchup texture without using a lot of sugar and actual tomatoes, but they are full of carbs so you can't use much in a product like this.<br /><br />I emailed them and asked. They told me all their products are about 4 calories per serving and 0.3 to 0.4 grams of carbs per serving, so it just sneaks under the FDA guideline for labeling it as zero carbs and zero calories.<br /><br />One you get past the texture, the taste is not too far off. I give it 4 stars as a low carb ketchup substitute. It does not stand up well though against regular sugar laden ketchups (including the low sugar ketchup that really isn't all that low in sugar).
