review/summary: Clear Men Scalp Therapy
review/text: My husband has bad psoriasis on his scalp. Nothing made the flaking go away until this shampoo. He only has to wash his hair every other day and no more snow storm on his shirt. I am not a fan of all the ingredients. Sodium lauryl sulfate is bad. It has a lot of chemicals in it. We try to do no chemicals in anything. Since this works so well, he will continue to use it but less frequently. The nice thing about this is it is a shampoo/conditioner combo.

review/summary: clean and no flakes
review/text: I received the bottle of Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff shampoo and gave it a try.<br /><br />I've used it for about 2 weeks now and it is great for daily use. I have oily hair, so I'm always worried that Shampoo and Conditioner combinations will aggravate those conditions. This product is "gentle" enough for daily use.<br /><br />No strong odors or scents with this one either.<br /><br />The bottle is shaped so that it makes it easy to tell which end the product will come out of from the top. Handy when you can't see well without your glasses. The bottle also is very stable so it sits well on the shelf and does not want to fall over either.<br /><br />I plan on buying more of this shampoo when my current bottle runs out as it provides a great job of cleaning.

review/summary: Effective relief
review/text: I don't have dandruff but I do have an itchy scalp. This product claims to moisturize the scalp so I gave it a try. Boy, did it ever. It gave me relief from the nagging itch spots on my scalp and really hydrated the hair as well. I can only imagine that it would be wonderful in treating dandruff. Great smelling product too.

review/summary: ***SEEMS TO REALLY WORK!!*****
review/text: I got this to use in my son's hair.....for years he's had a problem with dandruff, and no matter what we used, nothing gave us any relief.  When I saw this product, I thought I'd try it.  He's been using it for about a month now.  Last week I took him to the barbershop for a haircut, and even the barber commented on the fact that his dandruff problem seemed to be resolving.  I believe his exact words were "are you using something different in your hair?  Because you have hardly ANY dandruff."  Add to that the fresh, clean smell....and this is a product worth trying, for those who struggle with dandruff.  Certainly everyone is different, but this product worked for us.<br /><br />-DYB

review/summary: Smells and works well.
review/text: I like the smell of this stuff, though I don't know if that matters as I don't think the smell lingers long after washing.<br /><br />It also leaves me just as dandruff free as my usual brand.<br /><br />It feels slightly more oily than my usual brand and I suspect this is due to it being for Dry Scalp Hydration.<br />One thing about shampoo for me is that I usually look at the price and buy the cheapo because I never had a problem with the brand I buy.<br /><br />I have interchanged using them and its not like this leaves me feeling any better or worse than my usual brand.  Other than it feeling oily and smelling good when I use it, it pretty much does exactly the same thing my usual brand does.<br /><br />Now, I have yet to see it in stores but I would assume it will be more expensive than my usual brand so its unlikely I will pick this up when I need more.<br /><br />If for some reason after I go back to my old brand I realize something or I miss something about this I will come back and update, but those are my feelings as of now.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: I've used this shampoo, in conjunction with others, for a few weeks (my dandruff is so bad that I have to rotate shampoos).  Really, there's nothing bad about this stuff.  It's main ingredient, zinc, is commonly found in the same quantity in other shampoos.  One upsdie to this shampoos is the dry scalp hydration aspect - this, too, can be found in other shampoos, but I've found the ingredients here to be a bit more effective than other brands, particularly the comparable store (generic) brand that has zinc that I used up until getting the clear scalp therapy shampoo.<br /><br />One thing I really like about this shampoo is that it's not so "goopy" - thick and heavey - as other dandruff shampoos.  It goes on cleanly and rinses easily.  The hydration appears to work quite well, too.<br /><br />For the price, this is a good shampoo.

review/summary: Nice Product.  Muted Scent
review/text: Nice stuff.  Works well on dandruff and does a nice job of helping to hydrate your scalp.  Based on the ingredients they list it contains (ginseng, mint, and tea tree) I would have expected to be much much more fragrant than it is.  When applying it has a pretty muted scent and after rinsing out you can barely smell the stuff at all.  I have used other hair products with similar advertised ingredients and the scent was considerably stronger.  I would not be surprised if the aroma was intentionally muted as I am sure some men prefer a lighter scented product.  However, my thinking is that if one is attracted to this or this type of product due to the ingredients listed one would want them to be more or at least seem more potent.  A good product that seems to do what it claims.  I would just prefer a stronger presence or scent of the listed ingredients.

They both do a great job and I can't tell them apart (except, as shown in the video, by reading the label or looking very closely at the ingredients list).<br /><br />Both products take only a small amount to lather nicely.  They rinse off easily and leave my hair feeling clean all day.

However, even though this stuff is a bit more expensive per ounce (maybe not so much when you figure you don't need to use much) when it comes time to buy more I'll be buying whichever of these two costs less.

review/summary: works as expected
review/text: I got this really for my husband to try.  He has been complaining for the past year about his scalp being itchy and flaky, although I have never noticed it.  Over the past year, I bought many different shampoos for him.  He's tried them and really never noticed a difference.  He is a marine so his hair is cut in a high and tight (really no hair).  He tried this about 2 weeks ago and I wanted to wait some time to review it just to make sure.  He said he really loves this stuff.  He said he no longer has dry, flaky scalp and he also said this rinses out nicely.<br />So, of course, I had to try it and it's true.  This stuff is great.  It has a pleasant scent, makes the hair feel soft, not too overconditioned and I did notice that MY scalp was healthier.<br />My husband is now putting it on the shopping list to get.<br />Great product.

review/summary: Tested by 15 people, here are the results
review/text: Our neighbor has a pool and frequent pool parties during the summer. So we decided to put this in the shower room for a couple weeks, get people's reaction to it, and do our own unofficial product testing.<br /><br />The consensus was the same as my original observation - it feels nice on the scalp, it definitely hydrates and does a nice deep clean. But it's no more effective than Head & Shoulders or any other brand.<br /><br />Most of the people who tested the product had moderate to severe dry scalp issues, ranging from dandruff to psoriasis. Several of them are using a specialized shampoo like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KAA8KK">Coal Tar Shampoo</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000052XZZ">Neutrogena T-Gel</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OHE7RO">Dermarest</a>. None of them (zero) said they would want to switch.<br /><br />Of the people who had moderate scalp issues (i.e., occasional dandruff), they all said this product was nice, but no more effective than Head & Shoulders or even dandruff shampoo from the Dollar Store. Some said this was less effective.<br /><br />I personally like the smell of the product, but it is pretty heavily scented. Several women tested the shampoo, and they all complained about the scent (but hey, it is made for men). A few of the men also said it was too strong.<br /><br />The other common criticism was too many chemicals. On a positive note, the ingredients also contain a variety of nice, natural things: ginseng, tea tree, mint, vitamins b5 and e, almond and coconut oils, etc. It does seem to nourish the hair & scalp, just not as advertised.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: Like it, just wish it conditioned better
review/text: I have to use a dandruff controlling shampoo anything the weather becomes dry.  This product controls my better than other options like Head & Shoulders or Selsum Blue.  However it does take longer to work than Neutrogena T-Gel shampoo.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned how thick this shampoo is and I agree it is much thicker than others and smells much better.  It doesn't feel like much when you put it on and lather, no tingling feels but it does make dandruff go away and this is the important part.<br /><br />The only downside I've found is that I still need to use a conditioner to avoid the frizzy hair look.  I'm a guy guy with short and curly hair, and if I don't condition well it just goes everywhere.  This might not be a problem for others.

review/summary: Great Shampoo for Dealing With Dandruff
review/text: Clear Men ScalpTherapy 2 shampoo promises "to control dandruff symptoms at the source", "gently cleanses and conditions to leave hair manageable with a deep clean sensation" and is "clinically proven to reduce scalp dryness". I honestly don't know whether all of its claims are true, but since I started using it a few weeks, my dandruff has disappeared; no signs of all of flaking or of feeling lumps on my scalp.  It bills itself as a "2 in 1 dry scalp hydration anti-dandruff daily shampoo and conditioner", whose ingredients are" 10 nutrients and botanical activities including ginseng, tea tree and natural mint". The bottom line is of course whether it works, and I think it does. Moreover, I think this has been among the most effective shampoos I have used to control my dandruff symptoms. In short, this earns the highest possible I can recommend for a shampoo. I hope others will agree too with my favorable assessment.

review/text: When it comes to shampoos Brett isn't picky. As long as my hair feels/smells clean, I'm happy. This generally saw me purchasing two dollar bottles of shampoo and being on my merry little way.<br /><br />Enter Clear.<br /><br />Yes, this is a dandruff shampoo, and it wears that label proud. This is nothing to be embarrassed of though. I'm sure everyone has a little bit of dandruff whether they admit it or not. However, even as simply a shampoo I'm incredibly pleased. My scalp feels invigorated, my hair smells great, and dandruff isn't something that needs to even cross my mind. What I like is that this stuff isn't watery. You can tell this is meant to cleanse. And, without fail, it does.<br /><br />Sure, Clear is more than two dollars, but it is worth every penny. Recommended.

review/summary: its Okay..... that's about it...
review/text: So... I seem to have a dry scalp and have settled on two shampoos ...1 is the ever trusty Head & Shoulders 2 in 1 that I get cheap at Costco and when I use too much product on my hair and need a bit of help with an irritated dry scalp or build up... I will use the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo. The description on this seemed to be a nice combo of the two.... the 2 in 1 (shampoo and conditioner) of the Head & Shoulders along with the tea tree element of the Paul Mitchell. Trouble is it seems to be much closer to the very inexpensive Head & Shoulders and not in the Paul Mitchell ball park for me.  It didn't have the tingle of the Paul Mitchell when using and there is no fragrance attached so it was similar to the bland Head & Shoulders product. The results were also very similar to Head & Shoulders so I think I'd stick with the bargain product and this will not be in my personal "mix" of hair care products.

It is nice that it has conditioner in it, too, so it's best for hair that isn't oily.<br /><br />I have also tried it because it doesn't smell "manly" and was pleased. I suspect that it will not work as well on oily hair or on bad cases of dandruff.

review/summary: No Better Than Other Similar Shampoos
review/text: For those of you not familiar with my reviews, I prefer to keep them short. Simple. To-the-point.<br /><br />According to the product description: "Formulated with Bio-Nutrium 10, a blend of 10 nutrients and botanical actives, including ginseng, tea tree, natural mint, vitamins b5 and e, sunflower, soybean, almond and coconut oils to nourish deeply." I expected a stronger scent of mint or tea tree oil. It just smells like an anti-dandruff shampoo. As for nourishing deeply, I've consistently had to use a separate conditioner after this shampoo (even after leaving it on a while), as it doesn't condition well at all. And I have shorter hair.<br /><br />Additionally -- and this is no fault of the manufacturer other than, perhaps, a poor bottle design -- when my shampoo arrived, half of it had leaked out of the bottle into the surrounding bubble-wrap. Irritating at first, but I ended up not using much of what what left.<br /><br />You can get a less expensive anti-dandruff shampoo that does the job just as well, if not better.

review/summary: My Favorite Milk Chocolate, Delivered, WOW!
review/text: Dove Milk Chocolate helps me stay on my diet...One meal a day and all the chocolate I can eat! Just kidding, of course. Dove is my favorite milk chocolate. As it melts in my mouth, I am thinking about tasting the next piece of Dove Chocolate. I was hesitant, at first, to purchase mail delivered chocolate, but my order arrived in perfect shape with no melting.

review/summary: FINALLY!
review/text: Got a Keurig for Christmas, and have spent the past two months trying to find great coffee that is also affordable.  Over a dollar each for the ones that I was getting at the grocery store was just not cutting it for me.  I purchased a reusable K-cup.  Couldn't stomach the weak coffee it made, and that was with superfine ground coffee.  Not to mention that it often only brewed half a cup.  So, after trying many different types, I decided I liked the taste of the Starbucks Sumatra the best, but it was way too expensive.  Come to find out, Green Mountain makes the Starbucks K-cups.  So I decided to try Green Mountain, as it is MUCH more affordable.<br />It's GREAT!  Nice, strong, flavorful cup of coffee!  FINALLY!

review/summary: Just about my favorite K-Cup coffee so far
review/text: Got a Keurig for Christmas, so I've been having fun trying the wide variety of available K-Cup products.  So far, this is my favorite of all the coffees, and one of the few I'd stack up against a good cup of freshly ground and brewed regular coffee. Usually I like K-Cups because they're convenient.  I like these because they're truly excellent coffee and taste wonderful.  These and Coffee People's extra bold varieties are good enough to pass for the real thing - no one would ever suspect they were K-Cups if you didn't tell them.

Very strong, full bodied coffee without being bitter or having an aftertaste. If you like strong, fresh coffee this is it.

This is my method:  using a large mug, I first pour in about 1/4 c. of milk and nuke that for 60 seconds.  I then use either the small or medium (depends on my mood) Keurig setting and brew the coffee with the scalded milk, then top with a dollop of Bailey's coffee creamer.  Delicious!  I like a strong coffee but not a bitter one and Double Black Diamond works beautifully.

review/summary: If you like a dark and toasty big mug with just one K-cup, this will do it.
review/text: I have real issues trying to find a K-cup that will give me a robust-tasting enough mug of joe. For a while, I'd found near-perfection in the Coffee People extra bold mix... especially the Wake-Up Call (which got horribly expensive all of a sudden), but even those I only made on the middle setting of our brewer, and never the largest.  The Double Black Diamond still satisfied me on the largest setting, and has an intense, smoky dark edge that reminds me of the coffee that first converted me to the Pacific Northwest style of espresso---one I had a a tiny, roadside espresso stand out in the middle of nowhere between Tumalo and Sisters, in Oregon.  (It's probably not there any more--this was back in the 90s. LOL)  Anyway, it's definitely robust, and as I use milk/creamer, I don't find it bitter at all, but rich and worthy of savoring.  It will stand up nicely to a shot of your favorite flavor, and even shines through getting mixed with cocoa and vanilla for a toasty mocha.<br /><br />I just wish the coffees I'm finding out that I really, really like weren't shooting up into the "Can't Afford" ranges. But for those who love bold, smoky dark roast---this one is a real winner! I will keep it on hand for the times when I sit down with breakfast or with my Kindle to savor a cup of coffee rather than drink it in haste on the way out the door. But, if I find this coffee "loose" I'm getting it for my Eko-Brew reuseable K cups for sure.

review/summary: Good strong coffee
review/text: I think I have tried all the extra bold K cups out there and have setteled on Double Black Diamond. It has a good strong coffee flavor, an 8oz brew has just a little bite at the end but smooths out if you need it to by brewing it at 10 oz.  Dark Majic extra bold is a milder version but still very good.<br />Joe

review/summary: Bold + Flavorful
review/text: I love the Keurig coffeemakers because I prefer mild or flavored coffees, while other family members love the dark roasts--and this one certainly fits the bill! The "Double Black Diamond" moniker is appropriate, for it has a bold, dark flavor and aroma that was a hit with those in my family who like strong coffee. This size box (50) makes the cost-per-cup a good deal. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Nice Bold Flavor
review/text: I have been searching for a nice strong coffee for my Keurig that doesn't leave a bitter or flat aftertaste.  This a very nice bold flavored coffee that seems to fit the bill.  I am a bit spoiled after tasting Barista Prima's Italian roast as it has such a nice rich full-bodied flavor.  It is a bit pricier so the Double Black Diamond is a nice close second at a more affordable price.  I like my coffee black or with a little milk and this does not leave you wondering where the coffee went!

review/summary: Looking for a replacement for Starbucks and Tassimo? This is it.
review/text: I have been drinking Starbucks brand coffee with my Tassimo brand machines for years.  It was the perfect combination for me.  Now that they have stopped making Starbucks inserts I was forced to look for an alternative.  I bought a K-cup machine because it appears to be the dominant brand on the market.  This coffee is actually better than the original Starbucks!  I will not go back to the Starbucks brand even if they start making it for the K-cup machines.

If you are looking for a dark, rich, very strong coffee, this one's for you.  Those who add sweetener and cream might also enjoy this wake up coffee.  Double Black.... perfect name.  However, I can only drink one cup a day of this brand.

review/text: I like a strong, bold, dark roast coffee and Double Black Diamond is my current favorite.  If you like a medium roast coffee this isn't for you, but if you like 'Black Tiger Amazon' or 'Jet Fuel', you should try Double Black Diamond.  It will also stand up to a larger cup size for those of you that can brew them.  I usually brew it on my Keurig's 9.25 oz. size and it still makes a satisfying cup.

review/summary: If You Like Bold Coffee, This Is It!
review/text: My only hesitation in purchasing a K-Cup Brewer was whether the coffee would be bold enough for me. Since purchasing my brewer, I've tried many varieties and Double Black Diamond is my favorite. I drink my coffee black so I don't like weak coffee - I want it to be bold and smooth, not bitter. Black Diamond will not disappoint if you like good coffee. My other favorites are Green Mountain Expresso Blend and Coffee People Jet Fuel. I love my Cuisinart K-Cup Brewer - easy to use and no clean-up. I can make just one cup of fresh coffee whenever I want and don't end up throwing away unused or old coffee. And happily, I've found Double Black Diamond to start my mornings!

I was tired of picking up a limited supply of k-cups from the Discount Department Stores and having them taste a little weak. From the beginning, when your cup starts to brew, you can tell "this is going to be a GOOD cup of coffee". I wasn't disappointed. Great stuff. My wife drinks it more than I do but get it....you wont be let down at all, especially if you like just coffee....in your coffee.

Not for the faint-of-heart, this blend approached but stops short of espresso strength.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

review/summary: strong, burnt and bitter
review/text: I typically use my Keurig as a hot water dispenser, running it without kcups because they generally are too weak, even on the small cup setting.<br /><br />So, I'm very much in the market for stronger k cups.<br /><br />I can make medium size cups with this pod, but it's still a bit weak, and still bitter.  Makes a very strong small cup.  Perfect would be 2 pods, one cup, one brewed on short and the other on medium.<br /><br />As for the flavor of the beans, they produce a full bodied, bold and bitter cup.  Not necessarily a bad bitter, as it is pure arabica, however, I personally wouldn't recommend having more than one cup of these a day.  That bold flavor loses it's luster cup after cup, so it's not really a good all-around coffee.<br /><br />It's a good first or second cup of the morning coffee.  It's kind of like a cup of "good new york city coffee" back before the coffee renaissance of the past decade.<br /><br />Buying this in the extra large amount may not be suitable from an individuals' point of view because it's not something you'll want to drink 2+ times a day.

I myself use those refillable cups that one can find on amazon.  I have a half dozen of them.  I fill them with grocery store cheap brand and set my Keurig for the 6oz expresso cup.  It makes great strong coffee.  My wife on the other hand is lazy and doesn't want to mess with the two seconds it takes to fill the refillable little baskets.  She loves the Green Mountain Extra bold and as I buy it for her she doesn't care how much it costs.  It's good coffee and keeps my wife of forty years off my back.  I'd pay twice as much for that feature alone.
