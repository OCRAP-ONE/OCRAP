review/summary: A lot of powder!
review/text: I didn't like the idea of overpaying some of the snooty special foods stores for what should be a reasonably priced product.  So I went wholesale / bulk with 5 pounds!  Admittedly, it's a wee bit too much .. time to divy up for friends and family!  Great for households that cook Indian food regularly.

review/summary: yummi
review/text: We got a box of these to put in gift bags for our sons' birthday party. What can I say: it's a box of gummi pizzas. I wouldn't recommend eating a whole box yourself, but sharing them with a bunch of kids works great.<br />From a gummi candy standpoint, they're not the yummiest kind of gummi candy, but they have a bit more novelty with the pizza appearance.

review/summary: Poisoned Product
review/text: Two or three months ago, I subscribed to this company for automatic delivery of their dried chicken "breasts" each month.  When this month's order arrived, I allowed my Golden Retriever to eat one only.  Within a short time he became severely ill and continued vomiting repeatedly throughout the entire night.  I am a retired attorney/judge.  I do not become hysterical over every complaint that makes a claim that some product or other can kill your pet.  Now, I greatly regret my cavalier attitude about this particular item.  Had my Golden been weakened in any other way, I do not believe he would have survived this incident.<br />  My on-going purchase of this product despite prior bad press and numerous complaints was foolish.  But I trusted that the distributors of the dried chicken "breasts" would monitor this product more closely after the first recall of this product so that no other animals would be harmed.  Such was clearly not the case.  In fact, it appears that the only action the U.S. distributors took after the last recall was to print on each package that the product had come from the United States.  Closer inspection however reveals that although this product was packaged in the U.S., it continued to be imported from China.<br />  Amazon is by far the best retailer on the Internet by far.  My complaint is not against Amazon.  But I feel compelled to alert other potential customers regarding the poisoning my dog suffered (and he did suffer).  I can imagine other pets who are smaller, older, or in some other way more vulnerable than my Golden, would and could actually die if they consumed even the smallest amount of this product.  It's true that this was not the case every month.  Rather it is an intermittent but on-going problem.<br />  I cannot emphasize enough how serious this problem is.  It is absolutely necessary to eliminate the distribution of this product in the U.S. once and for all.  Please Amazon, end your involvement in this matter.

review/summary: Too brittle and overcooked
review/text: I did subscribe and save for these chicken tenders - 2 packages per month.  The first two batches were fine and I thought they were priced fairly.  The last batch arrived and in both packages the treats were darker brown like they were overcooked (instead of that light golden color) and they were hard as bricks.  All of my dogs are small - 15 pounds or less.  My yorkie nearly choked on one of them  I have been giving my dogs chicken tender jerkies for over 2 years.  I am going to allow one more shipment of these to see if they improve and if they are still this bad, I will cancel my subscription.

review/text: These chicken treats will make your dog do somersaults if you ask. Not only does my dog (a Golden Retriever) find them to be delicious, these are by far her favorite treat. I've bought pounds of them. When first opened they can be moist/bendy, but if you leave them open for a day, they become dry/crunchy. Either way, your dog will love these treats and love you for providing them.

review/text: The last batch that I received were very brittle.  I know that crunchy or hard is great for keeping dog teeth clean.  But, I have a small dog approx. 7-8lbs who does not like it even in small pieces.  I prefer to give them the dried meat products for strong muscles.  The packages that are sold at the stores are far more expensive, so for the price, I will tolerate the brittleness of their favorite food.

review/text: So far - so good.  FAST! shipping and my dog LOVES!!! them.  (personally I think they smell really gross - especially compared to all other similar type chicken breast strips).<br /><br />I thought it was a rotten batch because  the very first one was a totally new smell to my dog and he had to think for a moment weather he wanted the first one I was trying to hand to him.<br /><br />He took it - and then took off super fast and far to gobble it up (not usually that excited over chicken strips).<br /><br />By the third strip, I thought ... no more than 3 at time because he could possible eat till he throws up (again, not something he usually does).<br /><br />M A D E  I N  C H I N A  ?<br /><br />I am still in terrible conflict over the issue and am always scared to give my dog anything from China.  These are and so, they're fine.<br /><br />I only considered it after looking at my dogs regular long time favorite NAME BRAND that every gets - and 3 years later saw it to was made in China.<br /><br />It seems impossible to avoid all China dog products (assuming you are on a budget)

After reading some of the negative reviews by other buyers here on Amazon, I almost cancelled my order.  Now my dogs and I are glad we didn't.  The Cadet product packaging and contents have been top shelf.  Not having to pay sales tax nor spend time and gas money running to our nearest wholesale club because we have them delivered right to our door via our "Prime" account are big pluses too.  And lastly, the icing on the cake is getting the extra 15% discount with our "Subscribe and Save" subscription.  We gladly recommend this approach to anyone whose pet(s) love chicken breast filets.  Hope this is helpful.

review/text: I have used Buttler Buds for about 20 years.  It improves the taste of everything I have used it one.  It's been helpful in managing my weight.<br /><br />The groceries stores in our ares ceased carrying Buttler Buds.  I found where to get it on Amazon. It is economically sold by the case of 12.  It was no more expensive then what I had been paying it.

review/text: this stuff smells horrible! I thought that maybe it was becuase it sat for a while, but the smell never improved- I even left the can open for awhile. And not being judgemental I also gave it the benefit of the doubt that it may taste better than it smelled - WRONG AGAIN!!<br />It tasted just as bad! i had to give it one star becuase i was not allowed to leave it unstarred or use negative stars.

If you're watching your calories you can't go wrong using Butter Buds.

review/summary: Chipped ham
review/text: There are several listing on Amazon for "Hormel Bacon Bits" or "Hormel Crumbled Bacon", sometimes accompanied with the adjectives or descriptive phrases "Real", "Premium", "with Picnic Ham, "30% less fat", or "50% less fat"; at prices between $11 and over $42 per 20oz bag.  In fact, these are all the same product,  "HORMEL REAL CRUMBLED BACON";"50% LESS FAT.  The phrase "30% less fat" and the white or the dominantly light gold packaging are just photos of old packaging---not a current product.  Over the past year, I've ordered this product from at least 3 different Amazon merchants, and regardless of their description, I've ALWAYS recieved "HORMEL REAL CRUMBLED BACON; "50% LESS FAT" in the darker gold packaging.  So, don't worry about the "varieties", there are no "varieties"---there is just a single product.  You'd think that for $42 you are getting a better product (or larger package) than for $11, but in fact, it is exactly the same product and size.<br /><br />This is NOT "crumbled bacon", or bacon-flavored "bits" for salads---although it is terrific in salads.<br /><br />Think "chipped dry smoked ham".  This stuff is obviously the "sawdust", and small left-over peices, from slicing quality smoked ham for pre-packaged lunchmeat, etc. Some of the "chips" are pretty big, up to 1/2 inch. Being ham rather than bacon, it is genuinely "less fat" than bacon.<br /><br />I mostly use the chipped ham in omlettes, for which it is wonderful.<br /><br />Caution:  The ham chips are pretty salty, so always add them BEFORE adding any additional salt.<br /><br />Enough of the ham chips are large enough that you can use it to convert potato soup to "potato and ham soup", or as a very tasty addition to any vegetable soup. Mix a quarter cup of ham chips, half an onion (finely diced), (optionally) half a carrot (diced) and a can of sweet peas, cook on low for a half-hour and you've got great "ham and split pea soup".<br /><br />You can cook the ham chips with rice for great "ham and rice". You can spread mayo on a slice of bread and add a layer of ham chips for a terrific ham sandwich. Or make a fabulous "grilled-cheese and ham" sandwich. Mix with cream cheese for a great spread, or dilute with a little milk for a great dip.<br /><br />My Southern grandmother added "seasoning" to all vegetable dishes, from collards to squash to lima beans. What she meant by "seasoning" was a slice of "fat back" (thick mostly-fat bacon). And I must admit, her vegies were wonderful. You can accomplish the same thing (in a much more healthy way) with a teaspoon of ham chips and a couple tablespoons of good olive oil. I often add a tablespoon or so to "stir-fry" dishes---even those which feature chicken or beef---the ham flavor goes unnoticed, but pops up the flavor of everything else.<br /><br />The potential uses are almost limitless. Considering that the price of real smoked ham (which isn't half pumped-in water) often exceeds $35 per pound, $16 (the price at the time of this writing) is a good deal for 20oz.<br /><br />Since this is dry ham---it keeps very well in the frig, no need to freeze it in normal situations.  In my house a 20 oz package never lasts more than 2-3 weeks.  Because it keeps so well (and is so tasty that open packages don't last long), there is no need to buy it in the smaller 4 oz packages---except perhaps for camping or emergency food.

review/text: If you are reading this you probably know about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZHO">Huy Fong, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>, which is a great condiment and a must-have at my table. Huy Fong also makes Chili Garlic sauce (i.e. the one on this product page) which is a better sauce to cook with. The blend of Chili & Garlic is a wonderful flavor combination for stir-fries etc. You can also use it as a condiment, although it is not as fine and blended as a condiment sauce. While Sriracha is a great condiment I find that it's not that great for cooking use - the flavor seems to change due to heat. The Chili Garlic sauce is much better for cooking use.<br />I hope you find this helpful!

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: Received this about a week ago and I have already used it in tacos, black beans and rice, salsa and Chinese stir fried chicken and vegetables. The primary ingredients are chili, salt, garlic and distilled vinegar. It does contain preservatives, namely potassium sulfate and sodium bisulfite so if you are allergic to sulfites you might want to avoid this sauce. Be forewarned that it is very potent so a little goes a long way. As with any spice, just add a little at a time until you reach the amount of heat that is right for you. I can't wait to mix a bit in with my pizza sauce. It is a five star sauce but I deducted a star because I think it is rather pricey.

review/summary: Best Chili Sauce for cooking
review/text: There are a lot of Chili Sauces that I like, and it really depends on what I want to use it for, but when it comes to cooking, this is the stuff. I add it to any meat to make stir-fry, chili con carne, Thai dishes, burritos, etc. It's wonderfully versatile and can be used anywhere that garlic and chilies are appropriate. One of the reasons it's so perfect for cooking is because it's not all heat. You can add a good tablespoon of this to a dish and really mix it in without killing it. With, say, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CBFTC6">Dave's Insanity Ghost Pepper</a> sauce you get lots of heat in a few drops, which can lead to uneven flavor in the dish.

review/summary: the best all-purpose gluten-free flour
review/text: My fianc&eacute; is gluten intolerant, so I've been doing a lot of research and experimenting to try to produce something that resembles her favorite foods, from breads to cupcakes, pancakes, pizza, and cookies. Of all of the all-purpose gluten-free flours we've tried, this one is definitely the best. She literally referred to it as "magic". The key thing that makes this flour so much better than the bob's stuff is that they have a good balance of various types of flours and emulsifiers. Your average wheat flour contains flour from various types of wheat with different protein contents, but its all wheat, because wheat contains the key elements of sugar, starches and proteins necessary in making great breads/cakes/whatever.<br /><br />So, when you are trying to mimic the textures and tastes of the things you get when using regular wheat flour, you have to combine various other types of flours to get a result that tastes like the real thing (or better, if you really work at it!). This flour has a very nice balance of starches, sugars, and proteins (from the various different flours), that produces foods with good texture and body, without making things too dry or spongy.<br /><br />Buying this flour online is significantly cheaper than buying it at our local grocery store, and though its still expensive, I don't think any of the competitors have a product that produces foods that taste nearly as good, so I think its worth it.

review/text: Looks like flour, add some xantham gum when baking, or use it for other recipes, and it is amazing!  This is the BEST GF flour on the market... hands down.  Their pizza and their pancakes are the 100% best, too.  Muffins... not so much.  Lose the nutmeg.  Otherwise, use THIS flour to make your own items.  I just can't seem to get a good pizza out of it.  Everything else is incredible, though!  CONGRATULATIONS KING ARTHUR!  This one rocks!

review/text: I was recently diagnosed with Celiacs and must bake gluten free. I am in process of trying different multipurpose flours. King Arthur has given me the best results so far..in cakes, cookies, pie crust's, etc. I prefer it over other gluten free flours I have tried so far. It tastes and bakes much like traditional flour...good flavor and good results!

I have used it for breading, making gravies and sauces and in a quick bread recipe since I purchased it.  It's a good product.  Would like to see different packaging, but that is only my personal preferance.  I will continuie to buy this product whatever the pkg.

review/text: Why, you may ask? Why after spending several hundred dollars on all types of flours, flour blends and<br />lots and lots of different mixes? Most have tons of sugar and call for lots of oil to get their product<br />to somewhat mimic wheat. The Europeans do a far better job of getting a rise out of brown rice flour.<br />Well, King Arthur hit it on the head 1st time out. NO SUGAR and they even managed to get some whole grain<br />brown rice flour in there too. If you want a "whole wheat" look add 1/4 cup Teft. Tiny bit more water. My<br />best bread doughs spread like frosting.

review/summary: Sometimes, It's Okay being GF!
review/text: I've always had a soft spot for King Arthur flour, and this product didn't disappoint.  First thing I wanted to make was banana bread and boy was my patience rewarded!  It measured and performed just like wheat flour, no kidding.  In fact, it was the best banana bread I ever made.  I couldn't keep my wife's paws off of it (or mine).  Haven't tried it for yeast bread, and I'm not really interested in that, since it wouldn't perform like a gluten flour, of course.  Just very pleased with it.  I did think the cost was a bit much for the ingredients, but now that I have the list, I'm going to try making my own by experimenting with the 4 flour/starch ratios.  If this works, it will have been well worth the cost.

review/summary: Excellent Gluten Free Flour
review/text: This is one of the best gluten free flours.  I've tried almost every brand for my son (8) who has wheat and barley food allergies.  I recently used it with the King Arthur gluten-free pancake recipe off their website.  The first few pancakes were very dense so I added additional milk (almost double what the recipe called for) and they were delicious!  My other son (6) who is a pancake connoisseur loved them. He usually does not like gluten-free pancakes preferring Hungry jack (he's not gluten intolerant) and he gobbled them up.  My husband agree they were excellent.  Check around on pricing.  I misread the website and thought there were three boxes each 24 ounces for the listed price.  Instead I received one box.  Ridiculous in my opinion, but it's a free market.  I'll take my business elsewhere in the future and buy from a more reasonably priced seller.

review/text: King Arthur Flour is one of the best flours available and have used it for years.  I recently started using their Gluten Free Flour and find it to be excellent.  However, I purchase it in my local supermarket for $7.49 - so check around because 24 ounces doesn't go very far and at the prices listed here it can get very expensive to bake.  You will not be disappointed at the quality.

While it didn't last for a tremendous amount of time, it kept my dog working for a while longer than his usual time.  He loved the taste and, although he had never had one before, after sniffing it, he jumped right in.  I loved the quality ingredients (I recognized what I was feeding my dog) and the fact that it freshened his breath.  I also appreciated that it was grain-free as my dog has sensitive skin.<br />I will definitely continue to buy these!

review/summary: Actually not my favorite, but good and good quality
review/text: Like all of the Newman-O's cookies, my main issue with them is the bite - how they break and hold together when you bite into them.  For some reason, their recipes all result in what I find to be a somewhat unpleasant cookie experience texture-wise.  Unless I keep them chilled, for example, when I bite into them, they all tend to sort of moosh out of shape, and parts of the cookie will break leaving bare spots of the icing etc.  I just dislike how they have balanced the cookie between the filling and the cookie part overall.<br /><br />I've also tried several of their flavors as "dunkers" in coffee and milk, and while they will work, they don't dunk very well compared to some other cookies either.<br /><br />Having said that, I also feel that these particular cookies, while certainly tasty, aren't quite minty enough for me.  I like very strongly mint flavored chocolate cookies.  Someone else might prefer this type.<br /><br />They are healthful options for sweets that certainly don't taste bad.  I wouldn't buy them again and shared this review since other people might have similar preferences regarding the texture of cookies, which people don't typically mention in their reviews (and I wish they did).  But I certainly will not ding these as being bad cookies; it depends on what you like.
