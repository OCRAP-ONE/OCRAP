review/summary: Very Good Taste
review/text: The taste of this is very much like the product Coke Zero. I used an entire capful and I (as well as all of my family and my sister) thought it was great! No, it isn't exactly like the name brand sodas, but this doesn't have high fructose corn syrup or artificial things like they do either. It does take some getting used to, but after a few times it becomes just like the ones you have paid a lot of money for all these years. :)

review/summary: False Advertising
review/text: The (set of 5) wording on the description title NEEDS TO BE REMOVED!!! You do not receive 5 bottles, so you pay more than double the<br />price of $4.99 found at several local retailers. Very disapponting that this has been stated on the reviews, yet Amazon has not corrected the false info shown! Since this is a product that I have been using for several months, it didn't occur to me to read reviews on it. Guess I learned my lesson here!

review/summary: Cola Zero
review/text: I use the soda stream a lot since my original purchase 3 months ago.  Syrup is just too expensive on Amazon.  I can buy the same product at bed bath and beyond for 4.99.<br />My biggest complaint is with the soda stream co2 canister.  If you buy the unit from costco or sams club, you get a 130L co2 canister.  No one carries that canister so if you're going to do an exchange, you have to exchange it for the 60L canister.  Why would I want to do that?<br />In addition, soda stream uses a proprietary fill hardware so that you cannot go to a local "air" store and refill the canister yourself.  There are aftermarket adapters to overcome this, but they are quite expensive.<br />If I had to do it again, i would not buy the sodastream unit at all

review/summary: Awful taste.
review/text: This has to be the worst tasting diet soda I have ever tasted.  The bottle looks nice, and the idea is awesome, but I would have to believe the Soda Stream company is working on a new formulation because this is not good.<br /><br />i will stick to diet coke and diet pepsi.  All of their cola flavors taste off.<br /><br />Maybe a little better explanation is that is taste really chemically - not that any other soda tastes natural, but this one has a really strong flavor of modified sugar.

review/text: *****<br /><br />These are my favorite rice cakes. They are only a little sweet, unlike other brands, and the caramel is not fakey or chemically-tasting, unlike other brands. Sometimes I have just one after a meal, and it really satisfies my sweet tooth, plus fills me up if the meal is really light.<br /><br />Lundberg Rice Cakes are the absolute best rice cakes you can buy---the best ingredients and the best tasting, too. And at less than two dollars per package, buying them from Amazon is really the only way to go. They cost much more at health food stores.<br /><br />*****

review/text: I have been gluten free for over two years and have gotten quite used to gluten free snacks having their own "special" taste somewhat like cardboard with the gritty after mouth feel to remind you that they are healthy.  LOL.  These pretzels are even better than I remember "normal" pretzels to be.  My husband who is not gluten free constantly steals my stash.  I do not live in the US and have to go through a complicated process to get them as AMAZON only delivers these to US mainland addresses. They are worth every bit of the expense and complications as they are really really fantastic.

I am the only one in my household who must eat GF, but everyone -- husband and kids included -- agrees these are good pretzels. They're crunchy, but light (not rock-hard on the teeth like some pretzels can be). Great alone for a snack, or just the right thing to combine with Rice Chex, peanuts, and seasoning for a great GF party mix!

review/summary: The BEST GF pretzels available
review/text: We have tried MANY GF snacks and these are our families favorites. Most brands of GF pretzels are hard and flavorless. Not these! Light, crisp and yummy, we tear through them at our house!<br /><br />My 3 year old and I are the GF members of our household, but everyone loves them! My 11 year old generally thinks all things GF are "ick" by default, but she inhales these. Many of my kids friends say they are the best pretzels they have had, and they have no idea they are GF.<br /><br />We mix them with Rice Chex (GF but not other types of Chex or generic brands), raw almonds and chocilate chips for a yummy snack mix we call "Finnie Mix" - named for my 3 year old. Good stuff!<br /><br />We also grind them with raw almonds and use them as a fabulous breading for chicken nuggets.<br /><br />They are a bit pricey, but well worth it. The subscription offer from Amazon is a great deal (about $2-3 less per bag than any of the stores in my area) if you want to drop $60ish bucks at once.

I was a bit concerned when I read the sodium content, but figured I could just brush the extra salt off...no need.

It's nice to be able to give my son something that I don't feel like is a lesser product taste-wise than the "regular" version.  So glad to be able to buy them by the case since they are hard to find in stores.  The pretzel sticks seem to taste better than the traditional shaped pretzels--don't know why--could be mental on my part.

review/summary: Just As Good As Wheat Pretzels.
review/text: My kids were pretzels addicts before being finding out they had a wheat intolerance, so these pretzels were one of our first gluten-free purchases.  Many gluten-free products don't live up to their gluten filled counterparts, but these certainly do.  The kids loved them, and so do I.  We now keep them as a staple in our pantry.

review/summary: Great deal on best GF pretzels I've found!
review/text: I fell in love with Glutino stick pretzels when I started a gluten-free diet six months ago. I actually think they taste better than the regular pretzels I used to eat! The only downside was the price -- the local store charged $8.99 per 14 ounce bag. When I checked on Amazon, I was pleased to find they carry Glutino pretzels. Interestingly, the 8 ounce bags turn out to be a better price per ounce than the 14 ounce ones, so that's what I ordered. With the subscribe and save deal, the 8-ounce bags came out at just over $3 apiece. If you or your gluten-free child loves pretzels for a snack, and you have the space to store a dozen bags, this is an awesome deal! I have a handful of friends who also are gluten-free, so I've shared some of my order with them. These are amazingly good pretzels and Amazon's subscribe and save price is the best you're going to find anywhere!!

Stores do not stock them since they are a bit pricey but well worth it for those of us who are gluten-intolerant.  These are a must for me.

review/summary: Get these if need a POWERFUL LAXATIVE
review/text: I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch.  They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects.  Within about 7 hours after eating these my stomach started feeling awkward.  Shortly after I started having cramps and severe watery diarrhea several times throughout the evening and late night.  Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum.  The package I purchased said cellulose gum on the ingredients list, but on the web sites it is listed as carboxymethylcellulose.  You will find they are synonyms if you Google them.  All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping.  If you look up this ingredient, or look it up along with "side effects" you will find it is undigestible and can cause side effects such as bloating and diarrhea.  Never again.  All I can say is please post a review if this happened to you to others are forewarned!

review/text: As far as the product goes - these are excellent.  Can't even tell they're gluten free.  Nice and crispy and good flavor.  Usually they're packed well but the boxed was partially crushed on this last shipment and half the pretzels were broken. They had slapped a shipping label right over the "fragile" that was printed on the box.  Not good thinking.

review/summary: Awesome snack choice for Celiacs
review/text: I bought these pretzels for my dad, who suffers from Celiac disease and Type 1 diabetes. He has a hard time keeping any weight on due his restricted diet, and often resorts to potato chips for his sole source of carbs between meals. He absolutely loves these pretzels, and said he enjoys them more than the regular kinds. I think they taste excellent, with that very slight "burnt" flavor that makes pretzels so good. They also seem to have a delicious buttery aftertaste IMO. Plus, they're very satisfying and healthier than potato chips.

review/text: I love these pretzels.  They are just hard to find.  I think pretzels have too much salt on them and I am always trying to scratch off the salt with my finger nails or a knife or something.  Even if I wasn't trying to watch my salt intake I try to take the salt off because they just put too much salt on pretzels.  These pretzels are really very good tasting.  I was afraid because they are gluten free they wouldn't taste very good because a lot of the gluten free products you sacrifice taste.  But not with these.  These are very close to regular pretzels and I am so glad they come in salt free.  I buy them by the case.

Then they quickly dissolve; not very quickly, just more quickly than "real" pretzels.<br /><br />So far Snyder's gluten free pretzels are the closest thing to "real" pretzels I have tried yet. I just wish they were made in twists.

review/summary: Glutino Gluten Free Pretzels
review/text: If you Celiac or just perfer gluton-free, these pretzels are a good substitution for both other pretzels and other types of snacks. Despite what O'Reilly used as a tip at the end of his show, gluten-free usually mean more "carbs" for a similar serving.<br /> But as a Celiac, varity is truly the spice of life. Celiacs first response to diagnosis is to see all the walls between them and what used to be their favorite foods. Celiacs in this day and age are so much luckier than previous generations. Firstly, because Doctors are running the proper blood tests to diagnosis gluten-intolerance much more frequently. It might appear as if more folks are stricken with this these days, but I am convinced that is just because of this increased knowlegde by the Doctors.<br /> As to these pretzels. They may or may not strike you as better than your previous favorite, but you now understand that the previous favorite were the cause of "palor", malnutrision and gastro issues. So you must resign yourself to exploring the every expanding gluten-free offerings.<br /> These are not your Philly soft pretzels, but they make a great salty and crunchy "chip" with which to scoop up some hummus, peanutbutter, etc.<br /> Also, this size bag and the Amazon price for a box of these every month or two is one of the most affordable ways to enjoy these healthful snacks. They also good straight from the bag, but it easy to get carried away.<br /> My wife and I found out about my Celiac 5 years ago. It makes you read everylabel on every product you bring into your house. You may even go as far a throwing out all porous (i.e. wooden) utensils, your old toaster and several other things and can't be guaranteed sanitazied.<br /> You learn to trust mostly the food you make yourself, but when you learn that you can trust Glutino, and you can, subscribe to Amazon for regularly scheduled deliveries of all types of life giving goodies like the Pamela's Pancake Mix which go great with chopped, toasted walnuts, blueberries and a couple of raisins although, most maple, agava and other syrups are still safe.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8HY">Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists, 14.1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: These are the BEST gluten free pretzels
review/text: My wife and children are gluten intolerant and we searched for good pretzels for a long time. We finally found Glutino a few years ago and then began the quest of buying them at a reasonable price. Amazon S&S is the perfect place to find them at a good price per bag or price per ounce compared to a lot of grocery stores.<br /><br />These pretzels are so good I usually don't buy regular pretzels anymore and just eat a couple of these when I want to eat pretzels.<br /><br />If I had to make any negative comment it would be that they could probably use a little more salt.

review/summary: Wonderful Treat - Better Than Non-Gluten Pretzels
review/text: Not only is this snack delicious but it's one of the first items to be even better than regular pretzels that have wheat.  The recipe produces a light and very crispy pretzel, doesn't get stale after leaving it a month in ziploc like other pretzels.  Everyone that I've shared with agrees with me.  So it is very expensive though for those who cannot eat gluten, it's a must have.  I buy it by the case and sparingly share with others!

review/summary: better than "regular"!!!
review/text: These pretzels taste great! I am lucky that I am *not* gluten intolerant but for health reasons I'm trying to limit my gluten intake. This means I can choose snacks from either side of the fence so to speak. I think that these Glutino GF pretzels taste better than most "regular" pretzels. Less salty than most non GF pretzels too which I think helps bring out their better flavor.<br /><br />These tend to be a little messy - the sesame seeds fall off quite a bit - not so much they aren't on the pretzel but enough that a couple of teaspoons wind up in the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />The only quibble is cost; these are usually more expensive than another equally good choice of GF pretzel that I enjoy - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047IG6OU">Snyder's of Hanover Gluten Free All Natural Pretzel Sticks 8-oz, 12 pack</a>.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/text: These pretzels are available at the Publix near me. They cost more than regular pretzels, but our entire family (only our daughter is gluten intolerant)prefers these pretzels over gluten pretzels. They are excellent and I highly recommend them. Crunchy, salty, yum!

review/summary: Great pretzels!
review/text: I found these pretzels originally when I started eating a primarily gluten-free diet.  They taste great!  I had been getting them from my grocery store, but they are rather expensive, so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon for a less expensive price and I was able to get them for even less when I got them on auto-ship.  These pretzels are my main snack food and even my family loves them.  I would highly recommend them.

review/text: These are better than "regular" pretzels. They are light and crunchy with a buttery taste. I am so glad to have found these. They restored hope that I can have good food without the "aftermath" that typically comes with eating.<br /><br />My mother, who has no problem with gluten, tried them and liked them. She even packed up some to take with her after tasting them. She was surprised, because she thought they were going to be salty - like "normal" pretzels.

review/summary: THE Best Pretzels = they are better than those with gluten
review/text: MY husband cannot became alergic to gluten about a year ago and thus we have been trying all kinds of products.  These are expensive so I buy my kids pretzel's at the grocery store.  I can say these taste 10X better than any that I have had (regular / with gluten) - they have a fabulous taste.  I would recommend these if you like Pretzels - even if you can eat gluten they just taste great

review/summary: Best pretzels
review/text: These are hands down the best pretzels I've ever had. Since having to be gluten free, I've tried other brands, but truly prefer these. My non GF family prefer Glutino Pretzels to regular(poison) pretzels. My daughters friends always ask her to bring some to school. I have yet to find someone that can tell these are GF. Buying the case not only saves money, but I always have some on hand!

review/summary: These are good!
review/text: My girlfriend can't have any gluten, basically anything at all with wheat. Most of the gluten free products that would normally be made with wheat flour either taste weird or have a odd texture to them when you are chewing.<br />She came home with these the other day and they actually taste really good! Although most gluten free items seem a bit pricey I may buy a case of these for her, and help eat a few of them...

review/text: These are the absolute best GF pretzels.  My non gluten free family/friends think they are amazing as well.  I wish they had a bit of fiber in them, but most pretzels don't so its not a major drawback.  I adore the price of these as well, especially with Subscribe and Save.  I eat mine with peanut butter.  Yum!

review/summary: Love these
review/text: These are my favorite of the gluten free pretezels but they are expensive. So I decided to order a case from Amazon. I was VERY disappointed when the package arrived. They sent the regular pretzels and further the order said no returns. I called and they did refund my money but did not offer to send me the right product. I would rather have had the sesame pretzel rings I ordered. I won't order anything else bulk from here. I have had such good luck ordering from Amazon I was really disappointed with this order and Amazon :(  I gave a one star on the review because I did not get the product I ordered. The pretzels are a 5 star in my book.

review/text: These are simply the best pretzels I've ever eaten. Just a touch of salt, buttery, crunchy. OK, now really, are you sure they're gluten free???? OMG, so good. The ones with the sesame seeds are amazing too but I liked these a lot better. Pop one in your mouth with a square of dark chocolate. The best little bite of dessert.

I prefer the low-sodium ones, and they honestly taste as good as the regular ones.  All of my friends eat them too, because they're even better than normal gluten-filled pretzles.  Thanks, Glutino!
