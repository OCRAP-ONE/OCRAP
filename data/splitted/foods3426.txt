review/summary: Awesome cocoa but disappointing collection
review/text: Land O Lakes really makes fantastic hot cocoa. It is intended to be mixed with hot water, but I always leave room for a fair amount of milk. The result is the best you can get from a powdered mix - creamy and chocolaty. That said, I'm not wowed by the flavored cocoas. My kids like the raspberry and french vanilla but those flavors are too sweet for my taste. We all agree, though, that the mint and cinnamon are really good. That's why I was so disappointed to receive this collection and discover no mint or cinnamon in it. The photo shows cinnamon but it's not there, and it turns out the green box is the graham flavor, which none of us like. The dark chocolate was also substituted (I was looking forward to trying that one!). In summary, great cocoa brand but poor selection and not as pictured.

review/summary: Rich Even When Made With Water
review/text: I first stumbled onto Land O'Lakes Cocoa Variety Packs at my local branch of a national warehouse store. As some other reviewers have noted, in retail stores this product is treated as a seasonal item, so by the time the winter holidays have passed, you may not be able to just run out and purchase it. It's a pity that it sells for so much more online because it is a really delicious hot cocoa.<br /><br />All the included varieties are made with real powdered milk, which makes such a difference in your final cup. There aren't many instant cocoas that can compete with homemade, but this is one that might. The varieties included in your pack do seem somewhat inconsistent, since different sellers claim the same "7 Variety Pack" but have different pictures and item descriptions. The sampler I had contained Supreme, Arctic White, White Chocolate with Peppermint, Caramel, Raspberry, Dark Chocolate and Vanilla. The other flavors that appear (either in product descriptions or photos) are Tiramisu, Graham, Cinnamon and Mint. Generally speaking, all of the mixes are quite good. I found the Dark to be a bit too dark for my tastes, and the Arctic White a bit too sweet; I solved the problem by mixing the two powders together, half a packet of each per cup, and loved the result.<br /><br />Another nice thing about these Land O'Lakes Cocoa Packs is that the individual pouches are all tin, not just paper, so they stay fresh a long time. In my house, they didn't last a terribly long time regardless, but the last cups were just as creamy and warming as the first ones. I highly recommend trying out the Variety Packs. They're perfect for large gatherings (just add hot water!) and there really aren't any bad flavors.

review/summary: tasty but not a gift pack
review/text: Love the creamy taste of this cocoa but don't expect this to come as a gift pack.<br />I received this item as a gift from a friend. The boxes were packaged together in cellophane & made a nice gift presentation. I liked it so much that I ordered two more as gifts. When they arrived the individual packages were just thrown into a mailing carton loose.I was there when the one family opened their box and i was so disappointed that it was not in the gift pack as i had expected. I am sure they are enjoying the cocoa anyway.<br />I notified the seller twice.Each time they said they do not gift wrap. I did not want gift wrap, just the 'gift pack' as described. I gave up trying to make them understand.<br />I feel for the $30+ i could have made up a much nicer gift bag on my own!

review/summary: The Best of the Imported Brands of Pasta
review/text: Disclaimer: My mother-in-law spoiled her sons by making them homemade pasta any time they wanted it.  It was only when my DH went of to college that he had to experience the horror of boxed pasta.  Over the years he has realized that even the best of wives does not make homemade macaroni after a long day at work, and that he needs to eat boxed pasta.  (arrrgh)<br /><br />But there's boxed pasta and some stuff that calls itself boxed pasta that is decidedly inferior.  DeCecco is about as close to homemade as you are going to get without making it yourself.<br /><br />The spaghetti is a nice, mid weight string of pasta, with a good texture, bouncing back a bit when you bite it, and having a firm semolina texture. Little or no starch bleeds off in the water, and the pasta only absorbs enough to be cooked, no mushy macaroni here! Each variety has a preferred cooking time; if you follow that with a timer, you'll always be right.<br /><br />This spaghetti is a little pricey in the grocery store, which has to buy it from an Italian importer in relatively small quantities. Because of its price, it's unlikely that it turns over quickly and you aren't likely to get the best DeCecco around. The DeCecco Spaghetti from Amazon must turn over very quickly, because I always get very fresh product for a much smaller sum than in my market. Having to buy five boxes is no hardship for us -- we could buy three times that and still eat it all up in no time.<br /><br />If you haven't tried imported Italian macaroni, do yourself a favor: buy a case of this spaghetti and treat yourself with the lightest sauce you have.  Put a teaspoon of virgin olive oil in the boiling water to minimize sticking, and cook for the exact length of time suggested on the box.  Add sauce as soon as you finish draining.<br /><br />You won't believe that this is the same kind of food that they sell as macaroni at your local market. Be sure to make plenty for everyone.

review/summary: the best in a box....
review/text: All things considered, this spaghetti ties for best taste and texture out of all dried pasta I've tried. The other brand is a very pricey import and frankly not so leaps and bounds above DeCecco that it would be worth the extra dollars to compare.<br /><br />This is the kind of pasta that can be eaten with just a simple dressing of olive oil and a few shavings of real parmesan cheese. Does beautifully with heavier sauces too though like a good beefy bolognese.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/summary: Simply put, it is the BEST.
review/text: Feb 3, 2012<br /><br />"Simply put, De Cecco pasta is the BEST."<br /><br />I'm certainly no expert, but I have eaten a lot of pasta (fresh and dry) - both here (the USA) and throughout many of the regions of Italy. For my taste, De Cecco brand dry pasta is, in all respects, the BEST.  It cooks very well - holds up to and through the point of al dente without becoming mushy. Based on several different blind taste tests of plain pastas (without any toppings whatsoever - just removed from boiling, salted water at al dente), the De Cecco brand of pasta usually wins every time; at least, according to my pallet. Rustichella d' Abruzzo is another great brand of dry pasta, but it is really pricy; and, besides, the De Cecco brand, as I've already mentioned, usually comes out ahead (taste-wise) in the blind taste-tests that I have partricipated in.<br /><br />Both De Cecco and Rustichella d' Abruzzo can be purchased through Amazon.com.

review/text: This pasta sells for around $4.99 a box in our local Italian store so the price here at amazon is a real deal. I've been enjoying the De Cecco spaghetti for years and think it is possibly the best pasta in the world. It is perfect with butter and some freshly grated Parmesan cheese or will work with any sauce you wish to invent. Tonight I made a tomato sauce with olives. I'd like to try the recipe on the box - "Spaghetti Exotica with Truffles" Sometimes in life you come across a 100-star item and this is it! Off to look for truffles.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: A friend shows me a box of this stuff and says I have to try it, I go to grocery store and see the price and think no way! He ask's about it and I tell him the stuff is too expensive he is crazy, a week later he drops off a box for me, that was eighteen years ago and I have not bought anything else since, its that good.<br /><br />Really love the thickness of the spaghetti, Made from high quality Durum Semolina. I have found it does require much longer cooking times but that's it, only other problem, I can never eat just a little, I always seem to eat a huge plate full...great stuff.  You can find it on sale in the stores but most of the time it is rather pricey so glad to see it here.<br /><br />Also highly recommend their Penne Rigate pasta<br /><br />UPDATE...The first couple of times I ordered this it arrived fine, but today it arrived crushed, looks like whoever packed it smashed it while they taped the boxes together, Amazon did offer refund but now the price is much higher :-(  Might as well go to the store and get it now, same price but I will show some loyalty and order once more..fingers crossed

review/summary: quality with reasonable price
review/text: I am a pasta lover. The quality of the pasta means a lot to me. Previous to subscribing to DeCecco spaghetti, I was in the habit of hunting down cases of Giuseppe Cocco spaghetti, and frankly, paying too much. Free freight was hard to come by.  Then one day as I leafed through a copy of Cook's magazine, I noticed an article that discussed and rated brands of pasta. Although my favorite  Giuseppe Cocco pasta wasn't rated, the editors chose DeCecco as their all-around favorite, and one of the reasons was that it was made in a more time-intensive way with a coarser ground semolina flour for a better product.  I thought I'd give it another try. My attitude had been that it was overpriced and often picked up a cardboard flavor from the packaging, especially if stored for awhile. I was pleasantly surprised by my first shipment. The boxes are better quality now and don't give off a taste to the product. The spaghetti cooks up very well--good flavor, nice springy "chew," good window of time for al dente doneness, doesn't break apart. At the subscription price of $2/lb, it's very close in quality to Giuseppe Cocco which is about $6-7/lb, so I'm quite happy with my subscription, but five pounds a month runs out too fast. How about seven or eight pounds a month?

review/summary: Thomas Jefferson couldn't just buy this at a local store, but YOU can
review/text: Yes, this actually is better than standard spaghetti.  Common dried spaghetti tends to get mushy and break apart.  Even if cooked carefully, you probably notice that it is difficult to get your spaghetti to that "al dente" perfection.<br /><br />De Cecco pasta is denser and more durable, and cooks easily to a nice firm state.  It also has a rougher texture on the surface, which is supposed to help sauce stick to it.<br /><br />"The best maccaroni in Italy is made with a particular<br />sort of flour called Semola, in Naples: but in almost<br />every shop a different sort of flour is commonly used;<br />for, provided the flour be of a good quality, is not<br />ground extremely fine, it will always do very well."<br />- from Thomas Jefferson's notes on pasta, 1787<br /><br />While it is true that good pasta in Italy is typically made of Semola (or "semolina" as we call it), it is also true that, as Jefferson noted, there are quality issues involved in the manufacturing of pasta.  De Cecco isn't good because it uses semola (as do most Italian-style pastas in the US), it is good because it is made well.  Your everyday store brand of spaghetti is ground to oblivion out of any quality level of semola they can get their hands on, and the result is pasta which tends to turn to slush.

review/summary: Not the most versatile spaghetti
review/text: This spaghetti makes for some good food, but it certainly doesn't make the best shoes. I was advised to buy this specific spaghetti (De Cecco) along with a chocolate shoe mold (which doubles as a real shoe mold) in order to make my own shoes. After successfully crafting the shoes (after dehydrating them via baking), I tried them out. Note: the chocolate shoe mold doesn't offer different sizes, so the shoes were a bit smug. I won't let that impact my current review, however; I am focused on the spaghetti.<br />Unfortunately, I have to label the shoes as a failure for several reasons:<br /><br />Durability: the packaging doesn't warn you, but as soon as you bake the previously boiled noodles, they tend to crack without too much strain. I am 14 pounds, and I cracked my right shoes after 2 steps. The left held out for 14.5 steps (a large gust of wind was the source of demise). Needless to say, I had to make 7 pairs of shoes to make it to the bathroom.<br /><br />Shock absorber: after baking the noodles, they refused to give as they tried to act as a medium between the ground and my feet. I suffer from lower-back problems, and the incessant cracking of the noodles absorbed shock temporarily, but failed to work for too long (steps 3-14.5 for the left foot)<br /><br />Style options: Sadly, De Cocco doesn't offer spaghetti in a variety of colors, such as turquoise and violet. I like to branch out from the norm, and I find myself with similar shoes to my peers as a result of the manufacturer's failure to diversify.<br /><br />These are three of the primary reasons that I have to label the spaghetti as "minimally versatile."

review/summary: Gritty, Obscene recipie and a metallic taste to boot!
review/text: I'm not an organic person, so i don't normally order organic items. With that in mind, take this review with a grain of salt, as I'm comparing them to normal regular foods.<br /><br />The recipe on the side of the can calls for 2 cups of mix. the can itself is 2 and 2/3 cups in size. What pray tell are you supposed to do with that extra 2/3 cup of mix is beyond me, but i guess that since your getting a 4 pack, they expect you to combine them and make an extra batch.<br /><br />The cakes cook up nice and fluffy: if you use an egg instead of oil (recipe says you can sub one for the other). The one thing i can't seem to get my head around, or fix is that they always seem gritty. I blend them, I wisk them, I puree the batter but the grit is always there.<br /><br />Not nearly the worst part is the metallic after taste, if I wanted to put something in my mouth that tasted like a penny... I would be using a penny. It may be smaller, but is far less work, frustration, and money.<br /><br />on that note... stay away from this unless you MUST have organic pancake mix.

It is not very sweet and is a bit on the runny side.  It stores well if you make a big batch and put the left over in the fridge.

review/text: This one of the best mixes I've had, it was best to me when I used only water, no egg or oil. A dap of natural peanut butter on top and warm maple syrup is hard to beat. Don't be affraid of omitting the egg or oil, you can add a spoonfull of yogurt when mixing if you like moister pancakes.

review/summary: So so results with waffles
review/text: Don't recommend this mix if you like denser waffles.<br /><br />The thin batter does not have much affect on the outcome with pancakes.  However, waffles came out airy and crispy in my iron (VillaWare Classic Round). Waffles were much less dense than any I have made from scratch, including ones made with egg whites beaten to stiff peaks.

review/text: Warheads and Toxic waste candies are super sour! These candies are great, tastes good, gives you a good kick, and creates competition among friends and family.<br /><br />But caution:<br />It's citric acid. Any type of acid burns, the sour you taste is not really a taste... as crazy as it seems, it's really a feeling in your tongue. Yes it's a good amount of citric acid in one piece, but you're not supposed to eat multiple pieces in a short period of time. You will actually burn a layer of skin-like-material on your tongue. Too much consumption can cause the tongue to bleed. It will heal quickly, as long as you don't eat more in the process of healing.It is true your tongue will actually shed flakes like sun burn. I know it's disgusting but it's how the body heals naturally. Hope this information helped you, or any else it may concern. (Mostly your tongues)

review/summary: sour!
review/text: So, I was a kid when these first came out. They were really, really popular. ..anybody who was anybody ate warheads. I think the reason they were so popular was because kids would have contests-who could eat the most of these, who could hold it the longest before spitting the thing out, who could get the most in their mouth at one time...it was a status thing, basically. Most of us were a little scared of the candies because there would always be rumors of some kid in New Jersey who ate too many and whose tongue fell off-as far as I know that never actually happened, but when you're 7 or 8 you don't know that. Our moms probably started that one. However, if you ate too many your tongue would eventually go kind of numb and feel raw like you burnt off all your tastebuds, so the theory that someone's tongue burnt off altogether seemed pretty plausible. They'd also give you a stomachache.<br /><br />So, as far as sour candies go, these are the sourest I know of. Just thinking about them still makes my lips pucker. However, they really didn't taste that good. I remember Black Cherry was by favorite, but the other ones I wouldn't touch. Good memories all around, though!

review/summary: Fine Tea Experience, With Caveats
review/text: ****<br />This Cranberry Weightless tea is lovely, and has a marvelous taste. It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health. It probably does contribute to "Weightless" (weighing less) but only by ridding your body of excess water; still, if it can do this in a healthy way, I'm all for it. I like drinking it as a calming ritual before meals, which for me has some value, too. It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf.<br /><br />Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: "For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming." So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: "Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs."<br />****

review/text: Our fat orange tabby had been on Science Diet all 9 years of his life. He started hurling on the carpet more then usual (usual being kitty revenge for some slight) so we contacted my boyfriend's sister who has been a vet for over 15 years. She said sometimes manufacturers just change the ratios or ingredients in a cat food and it doesn't set well with some consumers. Eukanuba was one of the recommended brands -- a kennel I worked at in college swore by it -- so we weaned him onto it and no issues since. I'd recommend it solely because he's picky ( hates treats, milk, cream, tuna fish oil ... Everything ) and because it settled his stomach.

review/summary: Bloody Stool and Vomiting.
review/text: I have a 12 year old female who is over 15 pounds and my vet recommended a lower fat dry food.  I switched to this food and for about 8 months did not notice any improvement in her weight.  What I did notice was at least 3 times a week blood outside her litter box after she had a bowel movement and a regular routine of vomiting. I became alarmed and brought her to my vet.  After a full "costly" check up, he asked me what food she was on.  When I told him he told me that it was not the first time he heard of problems with this brand.  I started giving her 1/2 and 1/2 wet food in the morning and Innova Cat and Kitten in the evening, problem totally solved!  It's been over a month and not only are the bloody stools gone, but no more throwing up.  Be very cautious with this food.

review/summary: Not worth the price
review/text: Eukanuba is a well-respected name in pet foods, and it's a bit pricier than some other big brands.  So when we wanted to switch our cat Caesar from Iam's and saw this on sale, I figured that I was getting quite a bargain.  Oh the folly...<br /><br />Chicken by-product meal, Corn grits and corn meal are three of the four top ingredients.  This is what the high cost buys - by-products and corn?  If we wanted to continue giving him crappy ingredients then we'd have kept buying Iams and saved the cash (not to mention the fact that Caesar actually liked it)!  I imagine the weight-loss claim is probably true, because my cat would eat just enough of this to get by...he hated it!  We decided to change to a new brand after half a bag, phasing the new food in with the Eukanuba  in growing proportions.  Throughout this short period, the kibble from the other brand was always gone first.<br /><br />If Caesar had liked it, I probably wouldn't stick with it on principle...I don't think I should pay top-dollar for substandard ingredients.  Luckily, Caesar came to that conclusion all by himself!

With Pill Pockets, the pill always goes "down"! [Note: DON'T waste your money buying Pill Pockets for cats if you have dogs. I read a review (listed under another seller) that stated that it was more economical to buy the PillPockets for cats because you receive 45 instead of 35. Well, the reviewer failed to notice that the Pill Pockets for Cats only weighs 1.8 ounces, and the Pill Pockets (Small bag) for Dogs weighs 3.5 ounces!]<br /><br />Buy the bag that, per ounce, is the least money. The Pill Pockets are like Beef Playdoh, and are easy to tear in half (we tear each one in half and wrap 1/2 around the dog's medication). Do a little research, and you'll save money. BTW, the multi-bag deals online at Amazon are not necessarily a good deal, be sure to divide the total cost by the number of bags you receive to see if you're saving $$.<br /><br />NOTE: The size listed on the Pill Pocket's bag indicates the size of the pill pocket, not the dog. Large meds require larger Pill Pockets; small meds like phenobarbital require only the small or a piece of a large pill pocket. These things are great, and go down my dogs easily.

review/summary: Greenies Pill Pockets
review/text: This is the best way to give our dogs pills! We've tried other methods to get our dogs to take their medicine without success. The Pill Pockets and pills disappear instantly! Our seven-year-old arthritic cocker spaniel would find the pill in a piece of hot dog or hamburger and spit it out every time but with the Pill Pockets, she gulps it down! She can't wait to get her 'morning treat' every day!! Great product!!

review/text: I love, love, love this product! You never have to be slobered with saliva again trying to get your dog to take a pill, or pick up a saliva drenched pill off the floor! I actually get the bigger size and put 2 pills together in one pill pocket to save money. They are very soft, so even big pills will work with them. I put it in and kind of mold it to cover the top of the pill...takes a second. She loves them and it's her daily "treat"...I don't feel bad tricking her...she loves it.

review/summary: They work great!
review/text: I have a 13 year old Beagle that I took in last year.  He is now on 6-7 different medications/day, 5 of which are in pill form.  The capsule pill pockets can fit 3 of those pills in just one treat!  He quickly got sick of cheese, cream cheese, peanut butter, and I didn't feel too great about the butter my mom tried so I tried these.  They work great! Without taking his medications regularly, he would get terribly sick and probably not last long.  The pill pockets have made the mornings of me force feeding pills history and given me peace of mind.  I'm grateful to have found them.  Though I am currently looking for a place I can get them in bulk, cheaper, since I use about two a day.  I recommend them to anyone having trouble giving pills to their dog.

review/text: My cat has to take TWO different blood pressure medicines now TWICE a day (I've had her for 14 years- she's worth the trouble). One of the pills is apparently very bitter- and the only way I could get her to take it was to "pill" her with it, straight, everyday. It was torture for her and for me. The vet recommended these (he had the beef flavored ones for dogs on hand) and it worked! The cat loves them and eats her hidden, bitter pill everyday without needing to be "pilled" anymore. We're both very happy! :)

review/text: These Greenies Pill Pockets make giving pills to dogs a breeze.  Just tear off enough to cover the pill, save some "blanks" as encouraging treats, and your fussy dog will swallow even big pills like his favorite treats.  Especially useful for covering sharp edges of split pills, or masking what might have been bitter tasting to the dog.  No fuss, no clenched jaws, no snapping at you for forcing a pill down his throat.  A BLESSING!  And, NO discovering "spat out" expensive wasted pills or worry over missed doses.

review/summary: Love pill pockets
review/text: Pill pockets have been great for my dog who got tired of taking several pills and vitamins every day. He loves both the chicken and beef flavors, and thinks they are treats, even though there are many other types of treats he refuses.  I buy both the Large and Small pockets, mainly for variety, although regardless of pill size, you can use the large ones and just tear them apart to accommodate 2 or 3 smaller pills to get more for your money. The pockets are very soft and can be molded around any pill or capsule. They are much easier to deal with than using peanut butter or hot dogs, and if you're dog loves them, as most even picky dogs do, it is worth the cost to avoid pilling stress. The best prices are by ordering in bulk & checking the prices (& shipping fees) on Amazon once you are sure your dog likes them. Buying these at a local vet or pet store usually costs at least twice as much as online. Even my picky cat likes them as treats - but he hasn't tried them with pills inside yet.

review/text: I have two dogs, one of which takes seven or eight pills twice a day.  I fit them into two capsule sized pill pockets and he enjoys taking them...in fact, my other dog is jealous that she only gets one tablet sized pill pocket.  I used cream cheese, peanut butter, etc but eventually they always tired of it and the pill was ruined to boot.  Warning: pack these separately from pet food cans and other heavy objects or they will get smashed.  My dog has a very sensitive stomach but we have had no problems with these, although we have only tried the beef flavor.  I highly recommend them!

They are fabulous and if you have a dog with a sensitive tummy, but don't need to use them more than once a day and can use the smaller size you'd probably be ok. The pills that my dog is taking are large joint pills which require the larger size pill pocket and he takes them twice a day. I stress that this is a maybe. Just something to consider before you buy if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach.

review/text: My dad loves granola, and we used to purchase the Heartland granola with subscribe and save. It was a great deal, and very convenient, but it is no longer available through subscribe and save, and the purchasing options are much more expensive, so we looked for an alternative. Sweet Home Farm is a good granola and it uses natural ingredients; however, it is more expensive. It is still much cheaper than the grocery store: our local store carries the individual Sweet Home Farms cartons (same as in this case) for $7.99/each. It's sold in cartons like small milk cartons, so there is a minimum of packaging.

review/text: I've looked and looked for a decent granola cereal, finally found it in this.  You actually feel full when you are done with a bowl, and the flavor and texture are perfect.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Faulty memories??
review/text: I sat and read each and every interview...until I couldn't stand it anymore and had to write my own.  The "new" mountain bars are OK-that's all.  The "original" mountain bars were "great".  They were taller, thicker, heavier, better looking etc.  Two of my aunts retired with Brown & Haley so I am sure I am correct.  Not only have the bars shrunk considerably...they are all made flatter due to being stamped out by machine.  There used to be more peanut bits on the surface...you could see them and you could really taste them.<br />  No offense everyone but you don't really remember the original bars.  Ain't progress great?!!

review/summary: Mountain bar downsized
review/text: I lived in Tacoma and bought mounyain bars from the factory.  I really liked them.  Now they are extremely downsized from what I remember.  Also, they now mix the nuts into the chocolate.  The bar is not coated with nuts now.<br /><br />I can't find then in stores locally, so I ordered some on Amazon.<br /><br />Bill Breite<br />South San Francisco

review/text: This is the best candy bar in the world. I used to buy them at Yardbirds in Chehalis when I'd visit my grandparents. I wish they sold them here in North Carolina.

review/summary: Many Melted Mountains
review/text: Mountain bars are just as delicious as they were when I was a kid. They really shrunk in size though.<br />For taste I would give 5 stars but every single bar came melted into a blob. So for this review they should be renamed Blob bars.<br />They could have done a better job packing them.

review/summary: Eat it because it's there!
review/text: I've loved these since I was a child.  The chocolate is a distinctively different flavor as compared to the typical milk chocolate that the national brands are made from.  The only problem with getting so many at once would be how to stop eating them!  Any candy bar fan should try these.

review/summary: Sooo Good!
review/text: As a snackaholic, I decided to give this Black Truffle & White Cheddar popcorn a try. Afterall, I figured the air popped popcorn has got to be healthier than my usual potato chips. I was totally impressed! The flavor of the cheddar cheese is nice and light, not overpowering. The subtle flavors of the oil and salt are a perfect complement to the cheese. Combine the flavors and you have a delicious and rather healthy popcorn snack.

review/summary: Love these
review/text: I grew up on Sunmaid raisins and when they started to cover them with chocolate I thought I was in heaven.  I cannot get enough for these things it is dangerous, lol.<br />I find the chocolate is smooth and creamy and a nice intensity, the raisins are always soft and chewy.  These are perfect.

review/summary: Not so fresh
review/text: I absolutely love Raisenettes so I jumped at the bargain price, but never again.  The raisinettes were firm when I had expected them to be fresh, soft and juicy like the boxes I'd been buying from the supermarket.  I learned my lesson with this purchase -- next time, just stick with the supermarket.
