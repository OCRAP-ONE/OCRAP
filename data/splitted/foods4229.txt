review/summary: Not fresh, hard and disappointed w/ product freshness
review/text: Was so excited to find this at amazon since I had tasted this product and was impressed. It was good and tasty and it was soft. When I rec'd the 3 boxes I opened one and was really excited to experience the same foodgasm I had when I first got introduced to this fruit bar...first bite ...more a food nightmare since I have 3 boxes with 12 bars that I don't feel like consuming...it was stale and hard...What a waste.:(

review/summary: The Glucose In KIND Products Is Corn Syrup
review/text: I ate a KIND bar (Almond & Apricot) for the first time yesterday. Fabulous taste, crunchy, yet soft and chewy. One thing that concerned me was the ingredient "Glucose". That could mean so many things. So I contacted the company to see what their glucose is made from. It's corn syrup. This was their response:<br /><br />"Thank you again for contacting KIND Healthy Snacks.<br /><br />Please note that this ingredient is corn syrup, but is not to be confused with high fructose corn syrup.  I am pleased to inform you that we use only all-natural, non-GMO corn syrup, which when combined with honey, helps us achieve the best flavor while allowing our bars to remain crunchy.  Please also note that 13 out of our 15 snack bars are considered low GI foods, which includes the flavor you are referring to, our Fruit & Nut Delight bar.<br /><br />I hope you find this information helpful.  Please also feel free to contact me with any additional questions or comments, and I would be happy to help you.<br /><br />KIND Regards,<br /><br />(Name Removed)<br /><br />Customer Experience Manager<br />KIND Healthy Snacks<br />(212) 616 - 3006"<br /><br />Corn syrup, even if it's "non-GMO" and not high fructose, isn't healthy. One of my children gets very sick eating corn syrup, so unfortunately Kind products will be on our list of things that we never buy.<br /><br />Kind is being deceptive in not listing where their glucose comes from. They probably know that it wouldn't be well received if that ingredient were listed as corn syrup, not glucose, which it should be.

review/summary: Love these, but they keep shrinking
review/text: These are a staple on my grocery list from Amazon (I get two boxes a month on the "Subscribe and Save" program, and often have to "send next shipment now" because I share them with friends at work).  However, I've become alarmed when I open the newer boxes / packages- the bars are at least an inch shorter than they used to be.<br /><br />I thought maybe I had a few from the "end of the roll" or something, but it seems rather consistent now.  The cellophane wrapper is the same size, but the bars are missing at least a full bite of what the bars used to be.  And the prices keep going up.  I like these, but at some point the decreased "value" will get to a point where I'll find something else to snack on.

review/summary: AMAZING TASTE (I've had the almond apricot, fruit&nut, apple cinn pec, alm/cash/flax, etc).It's candy, dessert...
review/text: I would not use these as a meal replacement. Not enough protein, for one. But when I have them with a meal as dessert, no blood sugar spike. (I used to be prediabetic, and I do check these days to see how foods are affecting me.)<br /><br />But for folks who want a "less crap" candy bar or dessert treat, this one's it. VERY sweet. Tastes just like these chewy coconut candies my mom used to bring home in the 60s and 70s in my Bronx days. I used to love those. And I love the Almond Apricot for tasting like them. Every single variety I've tried--about a half dozen--are very good. But Almond Apricot is my fave. It hits the "oh, candy" and "ooh, nostalgia" vibe for me.<br /><br />My second fave (though it's gaining on the Almond Apricot in stealth mode) is the Almond Cashew Flax one. I thought I'd hate it (flax is not my fave thing), but man, it's like a gentle cookie taste in a chewy bar. It's quite delightful. I find I want to reach for that one for my evening "dessert" with coffee treat.<br /><br />Third fave: Mango Macadamia with Calcium. Very mangoey. Mangoes are my fave fruit and these do taste mango-ey. Macadamia is quiet enough in the taste department to let the fruit shine through. Different "bite" texture than the almond based ones, too. Smoother. (I'm a Caribbean born gal, and I've adored them since I was a wee one.)<br /><br />The peanutty ones are my least fave. I do find the cashew and almond based ones just are more enjoyable.<br /><br />If you low carb, you probably wanna steer towards, say, the Almond Coconut and have half (or one of the minis). It's not a lot of calories, and it's certainly a prettier nutritional profile for those who want a more "whole food"/no gluten lifestyle. (Beware the ones with peanuts if you're more into the Primal/Paleo side of things.)<br /><br />These babies are SWEET. If you're prone to abuse sweets like candy bars, don't even taste these. I'm serious. They're amazing. Addictive. Delicious! I've lost 116 pounds (moderte carbing, Primarian eating), and while I did order some (the minis, almond apricot, and others for hubby's lunch box), I think of them as CANDY. Not something to have in place of food, but something that I can have as a treat when I have the calories to allot. I also would happily carry a mini in my purse for emergencies. Because they have healthful fats, they can tide you over.<br /><br />How did they do on my glucose the way I use them (dessert):<br /><br />Premeal: glucose 81<br />Post meal: protein/veggies/fruit and one mango macadamia bar (after 1 hour): 88<br /><br />Not bad.<br /><br />I wish they'd ratchet down the glucose/honey, cause they could be less sweet. BUT...I cannot tell a lie: THESE TASTE DA BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I almost wish I'd never encountered them. They are tempting!<br /><br />And with the 25% off right now with S&S combined with the code good til 9/15, if you are dying to stock up, it's a good time.

review/summary: A Tasty Snack
review/text: I have a gluten allergy, so I am always looking for an alternative to cookies, muffins, granola bars, and other sweet snacks that I can no longer eat.  The Kind Bars are great - I have not found any that I absolutely don't like, but some I like better than others.  The Fruit and Nuts in Yogurt is definitely my favorite - I like the combination of nuts, raisins, and yogurt - it does not seem as overpoweringly sweet as some of the others. I originally discovered Kind Bars at Starbucks, but they were VERY expensive to buy on a regular basis. That was when I checked out Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, signed up for the Kind Bars, and cut my purchase cost by more than half - with no shipping cost!  What a cool program - especially for those of us with allergies who need regular access to products that are usually expensive and/or hard to find!

They are a great snack- they are very chewy & nutty.  I like them because I can't eat them quickly (which I often do with other bars) so I end up feeling more satisfied.  They have a great mix of almond & coconut flavor along with a very light honey tast.  Buy them- you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Just fantastic - a snack that feels like you ate something.
review/text: KIND bars are really the best of all the snack bars I've tried. They somehow manage to preserve the flavors and textures of the ingredients and still hold it together in a bar that's not overly sweet or salty. They do cost a little more than typical grocery store brands, so I watch for the occasional good sales and stock up. I find they have a pretty decent shelf life. With some of the other brands, I feel like there's often more filler and mystery ingredients than good stuff. With KIND, the fruit and nuts really take center stage. I haven't tried the ones with chocolate or yogurt.

review/text: I eat one of these bars fairly frequently as part of my breakfast.  I think the most telling thing that I can say is that more than a few times the first thing I've thought of when awaking in the morning is "morning! KIND bar time! mmmm!"  KIND touts their products' natural ingredients -- a claim, in my opinion, that is well backed by the ingredients lists and by the taste of these bars.<br /><br />My favorite types are Nut Delight; Peanut butter and Strawberry; and Sesame and Peanuts with Chocolate.  The Peanut Butter and Strawberry variety tastes just like a PB&J sandwich when you chew it up.<br /><br />These bars definitely get my stamp of approval.  Priced competitively @ Amazon as well.

review/summary: Tasty snack
review/text: These bars taste quite good, although I agree with other reviewers that there is a strong coconut taste.  Fine with me as I like coconut,  I've ordered three times and the bars have been fresh each time.  I find them sticky, which makes them a bit messy if eaten while hiking or on a road trip.  Everyone I share them with polishes them off quickly.  Personally, when I look at the ingredients in Kind bars I don't have many fantasies that they are particularly healthy.  Honey is sugar.  Fruit and nuts are concentrated calories.  Healthy fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy will do a much better job of ensuring that I get the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that I need. Gluten free might help some folks.  I do not doubt that if you eat little pieces of the bars spaced out over several hours they don't encourage glycemic spiking when compared to a Snickers or some other candy.  Otherwise I simply regard them as a tasty snack that should not be expected to be anything more than that.

review/summary: Overpriced bars, but REALLY delicious!
review/text: These taste great: the apricot flavor is not too overpowering, the bar itself is not too sweet, and I personally love the coconut aspect of it. One bar is honestly enough to fill you up if you are hankering for a lunch but either can't make it, or are on a diet. I don't suggest it as a meal replacement though.<br /><br />Also, this bar is perfect for a post work-out snack, whether it be intense cardio, or weightlifting.<br /><br />My only question is some of the ingredients: "Chicory Fiber" and "Apple Fiber"?? Are these merely included to up the Fiber content to fool carb-conscious folks into picking these up? Are these fibers even effective fibers??<br /><br />USEFUL: If you hate coconut (which a lot of people inexplicably do), you will not like this bar. There seems to be an overabundance of coconut in this bar, from the combination of the "Shredded Coconut" and the "Coconut Chips". I am assuming they made those distinctions because combining them into one Coconut ingredient would have pushed it ahead of the other main ingredients on the list, and this is supposed to be an "Almond & Apricot" bar.

review/text: I discovered these bars some time ago at my local grocery store - they were on this little display with some other things. The next time I went there, I couldn't find them. And I couldn't really remember what they were called. So, I was very excited when I saw them at Starbucks probably a year later. They are, of course, way too expensive there! I wasn't able to find them reliably anywhere around town, so I found them online and now I have two boxes (two different flavors) auto-shipped to me from Amazon. Now I have begun to see these in stores more often so I've been trying some other flavors.<br /><br />I used to eat Kashi cereal each morning but now I have one of these bars with my requisite Dr. Pepper. I'm not sure how long ago I changed my breakfast choice, but I have lost about 15 pounds (that needed to be lost) since I changed over to the bars. I definitely didn't change earlier than November, 2010. And, instead of being starving at 11 a.m., I don't get seriously hungry until later.*<br /><br />* These claims have not been evaluated by anyone, and no animals have been tortured to prove them.

Also, it's satisfying to get that nice crunch when you bite right into one of the almonds. The only problem I have is that it's hard to just eat one. I often find myself reaching for more. The fiber content is also an added bonus. Overall, this bar is a great, healthy alternative for a snack.<br /><br />For those who want the nutrition facts: it has 170 calories, 11g fat (5g from saturated fat), 16g carbs (13g sugar), and 4g protein.

review/summary: Great taste for Fiber & Protein
review/text: I just discovered these KIND Fruit & Nut, Almond & Coconut, All Natural, Gluten Free Bars at an airport. These were great.  They come in other flavors, but this is my favorite.  Almonds, because they are healthy, high in fiber and coconut is just yummy! Noticed they are sold in local supermarket but only in single bars, not by the box.  So, it is good to see them offered on Amazon and at a comparable, if not lower cost. I found them easy to munch on during the flight, filling (no meals on flight the flight) and was a great meal substitute with a bottle water.  I suggest you check the carb, fiber, protein content on each flavor as the % varies based on ingredients. I would not recommend these for anyone who wears dentures or braces, because they have a moist, but chewy consistency.  But, if you can take time to chew without worries, it's a very nice treat.

review/text: I love this bar. I am fond of most of the KIND flavors, but this one has slightly different properties because of the chocolate (which is really dark and yummy) ... I don't know why others don't like it. This bar manages to be slightly crispy and chewy at the same time. I am not a huge sesame fan, but it works in this recipe. It's dangerous for me to buy a whole box; I want to inhale them all at once. I suggest to try one out from a store and then order them here online in bulk if you love them as much as I do.

review/summary: I love these snack bars.
review/text: KIND are my favorite snack bars -- just fruit and nuts and very little else. This is one of my favorite "flavors." I don't like the ones with yogurt or coconut (too sweet). I put a couple in my bag, and they're always available if I get hungry and tempted to eat some processed, nutrition-void food. Very satisfying.

review/summary: Little too sweet
review/text: The bars weren't bad, but they were a little too sweet for my taste especially when you get about 1/2 way through.  But the quality of the bars are good and there're big chunks of macadamia nuts which I thought were the best part.

review/text: I'm a big Larabar fan, but after having a Kind bar I'm switching.  The nuts taste fresh and the fruit taste like fruit. The ingredient list is small and filled with great stuff.  I would definitely recommend this delicious bar.

review/text: We are not gluten free, however in my quest to find snack bars that are healthy and substantial, we tried these. My picky three year old loves this flavor. He will have one for breakfast before preschool and I am glad he likes it and it doesn't have bad stuff in it. They are super yummy in my opinion too!

review/summary: So delicious--and easy to carry!
review/text: I love these KIND Fruit and Nut bars!  Because they are based on nuts instead of granola, they are naturally gluten-free.  Since I have to eat gluten-free for my health, they are a wonderful thing to carry around in my purse for "emergencies".  One of these bars keeps me satisfied for a couple of hours, giving me time to figure out where I can get safe food.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that even if I found out I could eat gluten tomorrow (not likely) then I would still keep these around.  Enjoy!

review/text: I tried these before ordering them in bulk and cheaper from Amazon.com.  They are a great nut snack with very low sugar content and high protein content.  While a bit dry, they have good flavor and are good for you.  Much better than most so called energy bars.  And reasonably priced if ordered in bulk through Amazon.com.

review/summary: Sooo Goood!!!
review/text: I had my first KIND bar at Starbucks... The first taste of the Mango Macadamia and I was in heaven. One day, a Barista at Starbucks recommended the Fruit and Nut Delight and I have been hooked since. My boyfriend, who is picky about things, LOVED this bar.  I am thrilled to have found them on Amazon.com and will Subscribe and Save!  They are nearly [...]in health food stores..Ordering them this way saves me money.  Jillian Michaels also recommends them as a healthy snack bar for kids. She was the reason I decided to locate them in bulk.  They are gluten free and anyone who can't eat gluten and have had these bars are rejoicing!

review/summary: Kind Bar!
review/text: These bars are delicious!!!  I've always been a sucker for coconut and almond so I figured this flavor of Kind Bars would be right up my alley.  I was right.<br /><br />The bars are incredibly soft and moist; they bend by themselves if you hold them horizontally.  The crunch of the almonds plus the sweetness of the coconut and honey is so tasty, it's hard to have just one bar.  Amazon makes a good deal.  Only about a dollar per bar when I ordered them.  I will definitely order more :)

review/summary: New packaging means smaller bars
review/text: Our latest shipment of KIND Almond and Coconut bars in the new box SAYS that the bars are the same size as before, but they're 1/2 to 3/4" SHORTER than all of the previous shipments.  It seems that we're now getting less product for the money.  Our new shipment of Almond & Apricot bars will arrive soon.  We'll see if they've shrunk as well.

review/text: I ordered two boxes, one each of the Almond Coconut and Date Walnut.<br />Tasted decent enough but both are CHOCK FULL O' Nut SHELLS.  I took some walnut shell shrapnel to the the gum line and my wife pulled it out with a pair of hemostats.  It was almost 1/8th" long and looked like a sabre tooth fang.<br /><br />Can't take any more chances on the rest.  Chew with extreme prejudice.

review/summary: Almond and Apricot? No, almond and coconut.
review/text: Just FYI, for those that don't prefer coconut like me, these Almond and Apricot bars are LOADED with coconut. It is the 2nd ingredient. You can taste the apricot, as a subtle aftertaste, but other than that, it might as well not be in the bar. The coconut pieces linger in your mouth, so carry a toothbrush close-by.

They are already gone, so I'm glad I have a hidden box just for me.

review/text: As with other Kind Bars, I love these!  If you find that the Fruit and Nut Delight bar is too crunchy, try this one!  The dates are soft as are the walnuts (and it is less densely packed with nuts).  An excellent, healthy snack (and the price on Amazon is WAY less than the store where I found these for $1.69 each!)  Use Subscribe and Save to get an even better price on these.  You'll want to keep them coming!

review/text: I love these bars!  It is hard to find decent gluten-free snacks, and, these are a treasure!  They are packed with crunchy nuts and sweet fruit.  I like that they are all natural, too.  I don't feel guilty indulging with these.  They are great to take along to the office, for lunch or snacks, or on the road, and, considering their size, they are really quite filling and satisfying! They are, of course, a little pricey, but, buying them by the case from Amazon (especially if you use Subscribe and Save) makes them less expensive than they are at the local health food store. Excellent!

review/summary: one of a KIND, delicious gluten free bar
review/text: I have never been one to rely on nor crave a bar. Following a gluten-free and low- allergy controlled diet, I stumbled across these KIND bars while looking for nutritious options for my teens, thinking I would be able to try them. Well indeed they truly are scrumptuous. My 18 year old loves them and when running out the door will grab one or two for the road. I have only tried the Walnut and Date and the Cranbery, Almonds and Oxidants as I follow a blood type diet and do not love things that are too sweet. We are on our second box of each and I will be looking at the other varieties to try in time.

review/text: I'm currently doing a self experiment where I have cut out all dairy and all gluten for a month.  I didn't realize that in doing this, I'd have to be making almost every single meal I ate from scratch.<br /><br />I knew about Larabars, but I wanted something with more crunch for snacks that I could throw in my bag.  I stumbled upon these at a local store, bought one of each flavor, and just fell in love.  The Almond Coconut is my favorite.  It really tastes like a candy bar!  It's so nice to have something so healthy in my bag so that I can avoid temptation when temptation strikes!  Thanks KIND!!!<br /><br />Oh, and I ordered these on a Wednesday morning, and they were delivered on that Friday afternoon!  Thanks Amazon!
