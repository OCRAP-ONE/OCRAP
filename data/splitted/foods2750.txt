review/summary: Double Bergamot is Double Good!!!
review/text: I like Earl Grey tea, so I tried Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea.  It is really great-tasting.  Very fragrant and drenched with oil of bergamot.  I have offered it to my friends and they like it too.  No need to add anything to this tea, it is loaded with flavor.  My message to the Stash company is:  "please keep making this tea".  I am addicted to it now.

review/summary: Everyone loves it
review/text: I buy this tea in bulk because I drink it at work (beats the heck out of bad office coffee) and everyone who smells it wants to try it.  I have had the other version (spice chai) and love that this tea is also made in the double spice version.  I've had chai tea many places, and I've yet to find one with the beautiful flavor this one has.  The packaging is convenient, individually wrapped and easy to dispense in the box - I keep it on my desk and invite people to come by and grab one.  This tea includes clove, cinnamon, and cardamom and black tea - a wonderful, flavorful concoction.

review/summary: About the best Earl Grey Tea I've found
review/text: Since I first tasted Stash brand Earl Grey tea, I have not purchased any other brand of Earl Grey.  The other brands I've tried just don't taste as good and are not quite the same.  This tea is flavored with oil of bergamot, rather than just "scented" with it, as as some labels say on other brands of Earl Grey tea.  I'm not sure what the difference is, unless that maybe Stash just uses more of the bergamot in their recipe.  But whatever the difference is, it works!<br /><br />For an added treat, also try the Stash "double bergamot" Earl Grey tea.  I highly recommend both, and I regularly drink both.

review/summary: Bold but not harsh, excellent flavor
review/text: This is my favorite of the wide varieties of teas I have. It has a strong but not harsh, and definitely not a wimpy "herbal tea" excellent flavor for a cup of perfect hot tea.  In the summer I use 3 peach tea, 3 regular black or green tea bags in my ice tea maker for extremely refreshing great flavored ice tea.  Some other teas I have tried are a bit too sweet; not this.  I don't think you could be disappointed in this choice.

review/text: As a previous reviewer stated,this tea is a wonderful balance of peach flavor and black tea.I am a traditional tea drinker and could never tolerate those 'fruitty' herbal teas as they are not really tea at all. But this Stash peach tea has a strong black tea base and just a hint of genuine peach flavor.In the summer I always brew 2 or 3 black and Darjeeling tea bags with one peach tea bag and the end result is superb iced tea.I highly recommend this product

review/summary: An enjoyable way to start the day
review/text: I drank the regular strength Stash Chai for more than a year, and I liked it very much, although I always found myself wishing for a spicier version. When I learned that Stash also makes a Double Spice Chai I picked up a box of it at a local coffee/tea shop and decided it was actually closer to my preferences. When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it.

review/text: the tea itself doesn't seem hearty enough to stand up to the spices. What I mean is that even after waiting the right amount of time for my cup to finish steeping, I have a cup of chai that's spicy but not really strong enough for me. I don't like stuff toxic; that's not the problem. I think perhaps this tea is just not meant to be very strong.<br /><br />It's got a great level of spiciness, however, and it smells wonderful as it's brewing.<br /><br />Stash Company--how about just a titch more black tea in each bag? :-)

review/text: I just tried orange spice tea for the first time on a recent trip to Hawaii, and they had a tea chest of varoius Stash teas in the lobby for people to try. So I deceded to try a flavor I had never had before and I was pleasantly surprised. Now orange spice tea will always remind me of Hawaii. I bought a box of Bigelow Constant Comment, which is another orange spice tea, but it wasn't as good as Stash's, im my opinion. Stash has much more flavor, and isn't that the point?

review/summary: Steeping - the longer the better
review/text: This tea is delicious with milk. The description on the website says to brew for 3-5 minutes. While this is a normal instruction for black tea, it will not produce the best chai. Because chai contains lots of spices, like other spicy things, it is better if the spices have the opportunity to mellow out. Basically, the longer you leave it, the better it gets. You can leave it over night or as long as you want. If it is cold, just put it in the microwave or reheat on the stove to bring it up to your preferred temperature.<br /><br />The decaf version with milk makes a lovely bedtime drink.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG8M6">Stash Decaf Chai Spice Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

I was very aprehensive that my gift would be only one of good intention since I had no way of knowing what the cream should taste like and I had no idea if this would measure up. I got my answer half a second after the first taste when he did a prolonged "mmmmmmmmmm" and the biggest grin of delight lit up his face.  This man is a very well mannered gentlemen (he eats his pizza with a fork) and I caught him licking his fingers after he put the remaining cream in a storage  container...he'd wiped the can clean!  Thank you Roland Creme for resolving that age old question "what do I get him for Christmas?"  Excellent product, delivered in a timely fashion.

Unfortunately, that's where our happiness ended.<br /><br />The M&Ms that we received were not in the resealable 56 oz bag, but in three regular 19.2 oz bags.  We received them with other light items, also ordered from Amazon.  The box that the product arrived in was unharmed and undamaged, and so were the other items.  However, the M&Ms had obviously been crushed and melted before being packed.  It was obvious when we picked up one of the M&M bags that the candy inside was all stuck together.<br /><br />Not only was the candy we received not as described in its quantity and packaging, it was not in any acceptable condition.  This is the first bad experience I have had with Amazon.  We will be ordering from Amazon again, but not from Bice Wholesale.

I have found these unnecessary high sodium levels on all of Libby's canned products including their canned organic green beans which I will not feed to my toddler anymore. Unfortunately when something sits in this salty solution it soaks up the sodium- therefore you can't just rinse it off. Libby's could make this healthier, gain more customers, AND save some money on the manufacturing of this product if they reduced the sodium.

review/summary: Libby's quality, organic and convenient
review/text: We use a lot of Libby's bean and vegetable products, so I ordered these organic black beans without a second thought.  With the Subscribe and Save 15% discount (and free shipping) this was cheaper than I could buy them at the grocery store.<br /><br />The beans themselves are simple and healthy - the contents are beans, sea salt and water.  And they are a product of the USA, which is important to me.  I use them mostly to make Brazilian "feijoada" with ham chunks and seasonings, but I like to have a case of them in my pantry for other quick meals.  I've mashed them up and spread them in tortillas on burrito night, and the beans are firm enough in the can to rinse them and toss them in a Mexican salad, too.

review/text: These are absolutely the best canned beans! I've read other reviews on Amazon that complain about the amount of beans in the can. I have to disagree. The amount of beans in these cans is perfect. I combine these with a can of Libby's Organic Corn and a can of Libby's Organic Green Beans mixed in with Bob's Red Mill Organic Brown Rice at least two or three times a week. It makes the perfect easy meal for any time of the day. These are great beans!

review/text: I saw this at my local Walmart and thought, hmmm. I got a jar and left it in the cabinet for a while. Then I finally tried it with a cheese plate and some french bread. Nom nom! It was sooo good! But wooh, I started sweating like a nanny goat in a pepper patch! It's hot! These aren't those timid peperoncini they use at Subway! So grab a crying towel from your golf bag and dig in!<br /><br />I have a very cool brother-in-law who loves to put <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L112EC">Lays Flamin' Hot Potato Chips, 1.875oz Bags (Pack of 28)</a> on cold cut sandwiches. I think  he is going to love this spread. Personally I can't taste feta at all, and I have a pretty good taster. I'm on my second jar by the way. In an effort to write a complete review, I tried this on a few different foods and I can tell you, this is a must-have for me from now on when we have hotdogs. Take this to a picnic or family reunion!!! Put extra on MIL's sandwich! haha!<br /><br />There are going to be a lot of great uses for this spread. I found it in the section near pickles/relish at Walmart. I think it was 2.88. They have other flavors and I did try the olive one, but it wasn't what I had hoped it would be. This peperoncini is exactly what I had hoped! Five stars, no problem!

But you can add some bay shrimp, bought already cooked, when you add the boiling water and get a good meal, still under 3.5 ounces and a buck, plus some water; good diet item as well as a time saver.

review/summary: Good noodles, but tastes like chicken
review/text: These Cup Noodles are super easy to prepare and easy to eat out of the cup. I was drawn to this variety because of the shrimp, since I don't like chicken or beef noodles.  However, they taste like chicken or beef or pork or a mixture of the above. I didn't taste shrimp at all.  A dash of soy sauce helped the flavor.<br /><br />The noodles stay firm long enough to eat them all, without getting mushy like some pasta products.  There are a few dried peas and carrots in the mixture, but it really wouldn't hurt to toss in some leftover vegetables if you have them handy.<br /><br />Overall, they are quick to prepare and very inexpensive, so you really can't go wrong with them.<br /><br />As it turned out, they reason they tasted meatier to me is because they do contain chicken and pork.  Hopefully this ingredient list will be useful to other shoppers.<br /><br />Ingredients: Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Vegetable Oil (Contains One or More of the Following: Canola Oil, Cottonseed Oil, Palm Oil, Rice Oil), Preserved by Tocopherols and/or TBHQ and/or Ascorbyl Palmitate, Salt, Dehydrated Vegetables (Carrot, Green Pea), Freeze-Dried Shrimp, Soy Sauce Powder (Wheat, Soybeans, Maltodextrin, Salt), Monosodium Glutamate, Hydrolyzed Soy, Corn and Wheat Protein, Spices, Caramel Color, Potassium Carbonate, Sodium Carbonate, Sodium Tripolyphosphate, Pork Powder, Garlic Powder, Natural Flavors, Chicken Powder, Sodium Alginate, Disodium Succinate, Disodium Guanylate, Disodium Inosinate, Shrimp Powder, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Cod Liver Oil.

review/text: I love this cereal -- ate it all the time when I was a kid. But, I'm now supposed to be eating better stuff like bran flakes. Yes, it's better for me, but it certainly does not taste as good as the sugary-goodness of Golden Crisp.<br /><br />So, I mix three parts bran flakes with one part Golden Crisp.  Still getting the benefits of fiber, but with a much nicer taste!<br /><br />Usually buy this in the store, but Amazon had one of their huge price cut deals that made it worthwhile getting online.  The 4 boxes were shipped wrapped together in plastic wrap, so they came through just fine.

review/summary: Whatever happened to Sugar Crisp?
review/text: Let's face it changing names may be culturally correct but ruins good product recognition. I did not buy it to eat golden; that is the stuff they sprayed on Sacajawea tender disks.<br /><br />The name is not the only thing that went downhill; the quality control could be better. A lot of the little crispy thingies or I guess puffed wheat are fractured or misfired which also leave dregs in the bottom of the box.<br /><br />On the positive side this product makes for a quick and satisfying breakfast if you are in a hurry. Occasionally it makes a good late night snack. During the day without milk a handful of these crisps can give you that edge needed to keep going. It is lighter and simpler than granola.<br /><br />I always keep a spare package as you cannot really gage when the box may empty.  I have to confess that most of the time I use a different brand that does not come in a box and uses honey and sea salt.

The ones I've eaten are delicious. They will be awesome with coffee.<br /><br />I thought this was a reasonable price for this item - BUT I bought directly from the seller's website, and purchased enough merchandise to get free shipping. $30 is a little steep to me (with the shipping), however, the product arrived in great condition, and it will make an excellent gift for whom I purchased it.

review/summary: Quality turkey in a can, but too much water.
review/text: I used to really appreciate the Swanson brand canned turkey, but sadly it was discontinued.<br /><br />So then I tried Hormel canned turkey (10 oz).  I found the product tasty and the quality of the turkey was good but they certainly pack far more water in the can than is needed.  Hormel seems to have discontinued the larger 10 oz. can though, so I've had to switch to 5 oz.<br /><br />Fortunately, I can purchase it from Amazon now in a 12-pack, but I still long for the 10 oz. can.<br /><br />They certainly pack far more water in the can than is needed.  Honestly, if you drain and press the water out of the product, you are left with half a can of turkey.  This reduces the value and wastes shipping costs for all that water.  I understand that some water is necessary to maintain the product quality, but Hormel goes overboard.<br /><br />Also, It is a bit too salty for my taste, so once I have drained the water from can, I rinse the turkey before use to remove some of the salt.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quality turkey, mixed white and dark meat for flavor variety, convenience in a can.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Half the can is water, and it is a bit too salty.

review/summary: Great flavor, AND organic!
review/text: This pepper is delicious.  I didn't realize what a rich flavor pepper could have until we started buying this.<br /><br />The grinder is really easy to use, too.  We use a fair amount of pepper, but these grinders seem to last quite a while.<br /><br />And, this last time we bought this organic version, which our grocery store did not used to offer.  Honestly, I can't taste a difference between organic and non-organic pepper, but I feel good about choosing organic anyhow, on the principle of it all.<br /><br />Highly recommended to all of the casual pepper users out there.

review/summary: A treat for your taste!  Delightful!
review/text: Two of my favorite yummy things in the world are olives and cheese and blue cheese, when served with other food (I do not like it as a snack food pure), is the best.  These olives are quite plump and firm and are not overloaded with too much cheese, allowing the flavor of both, the cheese and the olives, to come through.  So often when I have had homemade stuffed olives, the ingredient used in the stuffing is simply overwhelming...not so it this case. As has been pointed out, the oil these olives are packed in make a great salad dressing.  Also, as has been pointed out, the flavor is indeed enhances when the olives are slightly chilled.  This is odd as I normally like mine at room temperature; but hey, what ever works I suppose.  Really, you cannot go wrong with these little nippers!

review/summary: Disappointed me -- not much blue cheese
review/text: I ordered these olives through igourmet at amazondotcom as I once had a dirty martini with blue cheese olives at Ditka's and it was fantastic. The can had opened during shipping and olive juice was all over my other items. Looking at the olives they were big and meaty but I could hardly see any blue cheese in them.

Fortunately I live in a dry climate, so it shouldn't cake on me.<br /><br />The container is about the same volume as a 3-pack tennis ball tube, though shorter and a bit wider. It's a LOT of calcium.

review/text: after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be "ginseng for women" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to "draw one's energy" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's "good for you" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?

review/summary: After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.
review/text: My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from "crisp and delicious" to "overpowering and slightly off-putting". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.

review/summary: Good tea, very gingery
review/text: This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.
