review/summary: My Best Friend
review/text: Green Label is my best friend. This is the Scotch I enjoy drinking regularly.<br /><br />Green Label is a smoky Scotch. One of the first single malts I ever tasted was Lagavulin, and eventually came to love Taliskar and Laphroaig. One day a buddy gave me a bottle of Blue Label as a present (yes he is a good buddy), and my days of drinking only single malt were few. I stumbled on Green Label in a four bottle Johnnie Walker tasting set. Green became my best friend that day.<br /><br />The first flavor is strong smoke and grass / peat flavor. Once the smoke clears, I get orange and fig flavors. It is all nicely blended and softened around the edges. This is one of the few Scotches I drink with no ice or water. The Scotches used for blending are all at least 15 years old, and that makes this easy to drink.<br /><br />I drink this regularly because it has some of the complexity and smoothness of Blue Label, without the high cost. I don't have to rationalize getting down the bottle of Green Label, unlike Blue. This is a softer smoother Scotch than Black or Double Black Label. I particularly like the aftertaste of Green Label.<br /><br />Green Label isn't always easy to find, but it is worth seeking out.

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: OK, so I became a coffeeaholic back in the 90's...since then I have tried just about every coffee imaginable....I have toiled with coffee presses...coffee grinders...pods...grind and brews...and you regular old drip mr. coffee pot.  I have owned at least 6 different machines not including espresso makers...so what's wrong, why can't I get a decent cup of coffee.  Oh sure, new machine I may like for a few months, but then it's back to mr. bitter coffee and many trips to DD and Starbucks...So what's wrong?  I'll tell you what's wrong, I kept passing by the $3 bag of 8 o'clock whole bean french roast with my nose in the air!  Fool!  I have been faithfully drinking this 8'clock coffee for 6 months now...I am beyond satisfied knowing EVERY cup will be a masterpiece.  I am now shunning DD and Starbucks...and my wallet thanks me.  Please give it a try...it will change your life...oh and, in case your interested, current coffee pot is a Melitta Mill & Brew which works well with the beans.<br />ENJOY!

review/summary: Ok, but not great
review/text: Eight O'Clock French Roast whole bean is a big step above Folgers and other supermarket coffee. But if you like Starbucks or Peets you'll be disappointed. It's nowhere close to the full rich bold flavor and smell (some would say burned but I like it) of these two (and some other local coffeehouses where they roast their own beans).<br /><br />To me, Folgers-type coffees have a thin bitter aftertaste. Eight O'Clock has a bit of that though not bad. However, the beans don't look freshly roasted and don't have a strong aroma when first opening the bag. They look only slightly oily and light brown. Not the dark oily look of fresh Starbucks or Peets beans. I doubled the amount of coffee I usually use to brew and the flavor isn't bad, just not rich and strong.<br /><br />** Update 4/20/10 ** I tried mixing these coffee beans with Starbucks beans. The resulting coffee is a big improvement over Eight O'Clock alone and slightly mellows the Starbucks.<br /><br />** Update 7/2/10 ** I just tried the Italian Dark Roast and found it slightly better, with darker and more oily beans. Perhaps this is due to all four bags being properly vacuum sealed, unlike the French Roast batch I received.

review/summary: A winner in Blind Tasting
review/text: A few years ago, I was teaching in the culinary program of a university here in Philadelphia. One of the things we did was incorporate tastings in most of the courses. As the students got more senior, they learned to run the tastings themselves. In the course of doing this, we got to taste a range of  products through the eyes and palates of future chefs and kitchen managers.<br />All the tastings were blind so brand names were not a factor.<br />In two coffee tastings, each with over twenty tasters and using filter drip brewing, Eight O'clock French Roast came in second in a field of a dozen coffees. The coffee that beat it both times-LaColombe-costs just about twice as much.<br />This coffee is smoky and emphatic with a full body and a long-almost winey finish. A great bargain and widely available.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman, author ofbang BANG: A Novel andNew Short Course in Wine,The

review/summary: Given a choice between Folger's and Eight O'Clock I'd take the Folger's
review/text: There may not be much inflation in the economy but there has been in the Amazon customer ratings. I can remember when a "4" from 10 or more people was close to a lock when it comes to product adequacy. This product's cumulative rating should have meant that Eight O'Clock French Roast would at least be drinkable, but it doesn't and it isn't - drinkable that is.  Really folks, those of you who think this is a GOOD French Roast have been drinking too much Taster's Choice Freeze-Dried (which I would accept a cup of before I would take one of this swill.)<br /><br />I never, NEVER throw food or other consumables out unless it tastes rotten. Half way into the first bag of this stuff I threw it and the other 3 bags in the garbage and sighed in relief. I had gotten rid of the worst rotgut bean coffee I had ever encountered. Really.

review/text: I purchased a 12-oz bag (whole bean) of the french roast based on the several glowing reviews posted here.  After finishing off the bag, I have to say I'm not too impressed.  It's okay, in that I would definitely choose this over any Folgers coffees that I've ever had, but the roast was SO dark that it tasted burnt (I mean completely charred), which masked most of the flavors that might have been there.<br /><br />It's possible that I just got a bad batch -- that happens from time to time.  But honestly, I'm not willing to buy another bag to find out. I've recently started buying from the Roasterie and Atomic Cafe -- with coffee so good, that there's no going back for me. :-)

I would rate this somewhere between Folgers and Rocamojo Coffee (one of the better coffee beans that you can buy on Amazon).  It is about half the price of Rocamojo coffee but it is also twice as expensive as Folgers.  Does it taste 2x better than Folgers? No.  Is it 50% as good as Rocamojo? Yes.

review/text: This Eight O'clock coffee is most assuredly, 'finestkind'! You can go out and plunk down bundles of bucks for your 'high-fallutin' name-brand coffee, but you'll only be spittin' in the wind. The French roast is robust, smooth, and aromatic, with no trace of bitterness. The original [red bag] is excellent, as well. We usually buy the whole beans and grind them at home. If you're not already using the Melita funnel drip system, give it a try. After all, your coffee will only be as good as the water you start with! Have you ever experienced a decidedly sour cup of coffee? If you have, look no further than the coffee-maker's water delivery system. In between batches, the stagnant water in the tubing becomes a bit funky. I once tore-down a typical brewing machine, the greenish slime that I found in the water lines was the stuff of sci-fi thrillers! Incidentally, for all of you coffee connoisseur snobs out there, if this brand of coffee was good enough for my parents' ol' percolator, than it's certainly plenty good enough for me.

review/text: We are daily home brewers and love full flavors like French Roast. After bouncing around from various retailer chain-branded coffees (which were inconsistent in my opinion), and occasionally trying the stronger roasts of more maintstream coffee brands, we decided to try Eight O'Clock. I think I heard it was highly regarded by Consumer Reports. Aside from the convenience and value of buying in bulk here, we are loving the taste - smooth, rich and no bitterness. Great product.

review/text: What can I say about getting coffee from Amazon?  All the bags came sealed well and in perfect condition.  The beans were fresh and made great tasting coffee.  I grind my own and was looking for an inexpensive way of buying 8 O'Clock brand cheaper instead of waiting for it to go on Buy One Get One Free at my local supermarket and this was ok I guess.  The price isn't really any cheaper or more expensive...  just another option.  I will say that 8 O'Clock makes all around coffee that isn't burnt and grinds really easily.  I use it in both a French Press and an Auto Drip Maker and it turns out great.

review/summary: Love it so much that I subscribe to it.
review/text: I read Happy Customer's review and I could swear that I wrote that myself! I have to agree wholeheartedly with that review.<br /><br />I too started my coffee addiction back in the 90s and I was a coffee late bloomer, in my thirties. I lived in Alaska and that's practically required. I too have tried every kind of coffee maker (and grinder) known to mankind, as well as every blend of coffee. Jamaican Blue, for example, is supposed to be one of the best. In a Tom Clancy book, he says that's what the president drinks.<br /><br />I originally bought more expensive beans. They looked pretty and by looks I assumed it would be better coffee. Then my ex, who had more than just a few problems, emptied out the bank account. I had to cut back on a number of things, but coffee was one that I could not shed. Enter Eight O'Clock coffee.<br /><br />I was quite surprised when I tasted it. It was really very good. I thought that must be a fluke. When it was gone, I tried it again and to my dismay I still liked it. I've never gone back either. I am very happy with it.<br /><br />You must understand though that it's not pretty. They don't have the shiny beans that actually costs you extra and are of no benefit. Some are even broken beans, but so what? I'm not eating the beans, I'm grinding them. I don't care if they're already broken.<br /><br />All in all, I'm so pleased that I subscribe to it regularly. Also another perk: I found it was cheaper here to buy this via subscription than it is to buy it at Walmart!

But with this coffee, I get a very faint aroma from slightly more than medium-roasted beans.  The flavor is mellow and slightly acidic.  I was not very impressed; but then, I am highly partial to a dark roast.  Bad batch?  Perhaps.  If you like a dark, robust, French roast, then be wary of Eight O'Clock.

review/text: Eight O'Clock Coffee French Roast fits our bill for an everyday brew.  We grind the whole beans ourselves to a relatively fine grind.  This is a medium dark french roast with complex earthy flavors.  You won't find (or miss) Starbuck's burnt taste.  If you're looking for a good morning coffee at the right price I'd give this one a try.

review/text: This is an excellent coffee, but the packages are too small. The alternate, 5-pound bag of the same product is much more expensive. As of today's (4/9/2008) pricing, this small bag is 44 cents per ounce, but the 5-pound bag is 52 cents per ounce, about 18 percent higher for a more efficient package.

I tried to smash them with a hammer but they were inconsistent.  When I did manage to borrow a grinder from a homeless man, I found that the Coffee tasted like poo.

review/summary: Best of the Best
review/text: I was lucky enough to tour this olive oil factory and orchard in Sicily just last week. I went with my extended family of 20 people (adults and kids) and we spent two hours in the orchards and in the factory itself learning about the process and then tasting the final results. This is, by far, one of the best olive oils I have ever tasted, period. The flavor is both smooth and deep with lovely color and a rich, full feeling on the tongue. Actually, all their olive oils are fantastic...and they also sell an organic version of the Primo (but I believe it doesn't have the DOP label). And the deep dedication and care the family takes with their trees and production is very, very obvious. Sadly, they don't sell it in the stores on the West Coast so I have to get my fix here. But for all you East Coasters...it's available in Whole Foods and other fine grocery stores (but the pricing is better on Amazon).

review/summary: Amazing Olive Oil!!
review/text: I received this olive oil a few months ago and i have been using it for alot<br />of different things. from salads and marinades and cooking, to just dipping bread in it.<br />This olive oil is absolutely amazing...upon opening the bottle for the first<br />time, i must say that it was an experience!!When you open this bottle for the first time...<br />the aroma hits you like a runaway freight train. I personally have never encountered<br />olive oil of this caliber. This was obviously a true labor of love. The cold<br />press date is on the bottle and this batch was cold pressed in november of 2010,<br />so it is definately VERY fresh. I cannot recommend this product enough!!<br /> I have tried many different olive oils and pretty much most if not all of<br />the ones i see in stores never have the cold press date on them and if they<br />do, its like 2 years old..rediculous...these people are proud of what they do and<br />it shows in the fact that they clearly list the cold press date right on the bottle.<br /> and the pressing of this is only about 6-7 months old..amazing.<br />One last thing...When i recieved this bottle of olive oil it was packaged in<br />a box...and the bottle is a dark DARK green, which says to me that they<br />have also packaged this oil correctly..ie..it was probably immediately packaged<br />in the box to keep sunlight away from it! and also the bottle color is correct..<br />olive oil's main enemy is sunlight...<br /> So all that being said...it is amazing..buy it...you will not be disapointed!

review/text: I have suffered with arthritis for some time and found little natural relief.  I read that cherry juice could help and that some juices were better than others.  I'd tried some other kinds of cherry juice and got a little relief from my arthritis pain.  Then I tried this one and it is significantly better.  I love the taste of cherries and cherry juice and this is one of the best.  But to get the added health benefits, too, is wonderful.

review/summary: 100% unsweetened natural Montmorency cherry juice
review/text: I have trouble getting to sleep and sleeping soundly.  I have heard from a few people and saw on Dr.Oz (lol...yes, I try some of the things he suggests) that a few ounces of 100% unsweetened 'pie cherry' juice (which I have since found out is Montmorency cherry juice) can be of help.  Well...it is helping me...and its full of antioxidants too...another good reason to have a sip of this juice daily.  Have read more and I now know that this juice is full of tryptophan, the same stuff in turkey =) that helps you feel so snoozy!  I shopped around in Amazon AND in local stores, this is THE best price.  8 plastic jugs came cardboard divided, in a box,<br />I will be purchasing from this seller again through Amazon.  A Made in Michigan product.  (PS/this is TART but not unpleasant in the least, to me its not as tart<br />as cranberry juice.  It made me remember the days of my Nana making cherry pies<br />and I got to drink the left over cherry juice...its the same juice)

review/text: We have now ordered three cases of this wonderful juice. It has the perfect blend of tart and sweet. Tastes just like you picked the very best cherries, squeezed them and drank the juice. I first ordered it because I had heard that cherry juice helped with gout. (I haven't had a flareup since beginning drinking this juice.) Then I started drinking it just because I couldn't think of anything that tasted better! The price is very reasonable, shipping was fast and the labels come off easily so I can use them in my shop for nails, screws, etc., after they're empty. If you are a gout sufferer and just HAVE to have a bit of vodka, tequila, etc., now and then, try mixing your favorite adult beverage with Indian Summer Cherry Juice. You'll never go back to cranberry, lemonade, etc. I just hope they never run out of cherries!!!

review/text: I was a little worried that the juice wouldn't be as strong as the "tart cherry concentrates", but I still find myself needing to water it down as much as I do POM pomegranate juice.<br /><br />The juice is a bit tart, but very sweet as well on it's own. It's fresher tasting then other ones I've tried as well- without old sediment floating on the bottom.<br /><br />An 8 pack sounds like a lot- but the bottles are only 46 ounces, not 64 like I usually get from Costco.<br /><br />The price on them is fairly higher than buying other juices from Costco locally- but I'm not just buying them for the taste- it also helps a bit with reducing muscle soreness after working out.<br /><br />It's a good tasting juice, reasonable price, and helps reduce muscle soreness- I'll definitely keep buying!

review/text: So far I like this cherry juice best.  I was expecting it to be thinner and watered down compared to the concentrate (I had been mixing Tart is Smart concentrate 1/2 cup per Qt of water which I believe is what they suggest) but this tastes much better and stronger.  Perhaps tastes better because it tastes stronger to me.  The tart cherry juice works better than Glucosamine for me, my knees creak far less and I am much more limber when I wake up.  I can't say anything about sleeping better as I slept fine before I started drinking cherry juice.

review/text: Tart cherry juice, no added sugar, is a healthy drink, which you can always sweeten with a bit of diet 7-Up or Sprite, if your lips pucker. Even with shipping, it's less than city stores and none carry it in rural AR. The product is good and shipping fairly reasonable, if you order by the case.<br /><br />Not sure if Dr Oz' recommendation means anything (He has won a Pigasus, you know - look it up), but he endorses cherry juice among a thousand other things.

review/text: There have been studies on cherry juice and athletic performance so I thought I'll give it a personal test. Unfortunately I've become unemployed so my training and competition had to stop cause I can't afford the cost that is associated with the training and the competition.<br /><br />I've only consumed the juice for three weeks before stopping training so I can't make a judgement on the effectiveness as a sports performance supplement. I can, however, say that the taste of this juice is pretty good. Since I stopped training the taste has become too sweet so I have to add 25% water to dilute it before I can stomach it. It is not tart and if you like the taste of cherry you'll probably like this juice.

review/summary: Great fudge
review/text: Got two pounds of Amish Buggy fudge for my mom for mother's day - it came really early! It's hard to get her treats because we live over 2,000 miles apart, but apparently this fudge ships really well. My mom reports that she has been enjoying the fudge for several days now. I got her the chocolate pecan and the turtle kind, and she said both are delicious. The turtle one is softer, she says, but she liked the chocolate pecan one best. Will definitely be purchasing from this place in the future!

review/text: I ordered some as a special treat for myself and my mom.  We both love it!  It's very sweet, very soft, and uses a very strong mint flavor like we both love.  The two different sizes in cuts is kind of confusing to me but I think it adds to the homemade charm of the fudge itself.<br /><br />I really also appreciate the effort it took to get it here.  My fudge was packed in ice packs.  And I also appreciate the little plastic knife for cutting.

But this morning we tried the Carte Noire given us as a Christmas gift. What a delightful surprise. It has that "blackness" that we associate with good coffee but none of the bitterness. It is unquestionably the best coffee we have ever made at home. And with a small addition of Irish Creme syrup (another Christmas present), it was simply quite wonderful.

review/summary: Best commercial coffee, ever
review/text: I found Carte Noire in France in 1993 and started bringing packages back with me three or four times each year.  What captured my attention so firmly?  What makes this coffee so great?<br /><br />It is unusual simply because: (1) It is 100% Arabica; (2) It is 100% Colombian.  (3) It is roasted by the French.  There is only one other coffee with this particular rare pedigree, and it is good, but not quite as good as Carte Noire.  Amazon's ad terminology calls this an after dinner coffee.  I disagree with them.  We have always used it exclusively in the morning, as do the Europeans who value its rich taste.<br /><br />This coffee is bold but not overpowering.  It avoids giving you a thin or a bitter coffee taste.  One package of 250 grams (very finely ground) will last for exactly five days when brewed in a 12-cup pot.  My coffee philosophy is this:  If you're going to drink coffee, buy and drink the best one you can find anywhere.  This is it.  I wouldn't lie about something this important.

review/text: My wife and I found this coffee in France during a "coffee buying spree".  We bought a little of everything and enjoyed them through out the year.  One of the more inexpensive brands (in France) is Carte Noire.  It might be common coffee in France, but to us it was the absolute best.  We order several each year.  I'm the hit with my fellow adults when I bring it to a Boy Scout camp out. My fellow adults even pout when I run out.<br /><br />This is some great stuff and the seller does a nice job in shipping it.  Be aware that sometimes it is out of stock, so you might join us and order a few and stock it up in the freezer.

review/summary: Skimpy grazing in these parts with this product, sad to say
review/text: Last month after my local pet store ran out of the Cosmic cat grass my cats had long been using to fight off hairballs,  I came here to Amazon, found two products that looked interesting and bought  one of each.  I had very disappointing luck with this one.  I  read the instructions and followed them clearly, paying particular attention to keeping the soil moist and warm and the light dim until germination. I used an 8-inch garden pot and the same Miracle Grow potting soil that had worked wonders in my outdoor garden pots.  But the results were disappointing.  All I got were a scattered few strands of grass.  A  second attempt, using more seeds and a different, smaller pot netted the same meager results.<br /><br />Meanwhile my other purchase, the Pet Greens Garden Wheat Grass Self-Grow Kit--which came with similar instructions, but  its own soil, disposable planter pouch and far fewer seeds at twice the price--produced a veritable thicket of grass that kept  growing and growing and, despite daily grazings from three cats,  lasted  five full weeks.<br /><br />I still have some Nibble-Licious seeds left, so would gladly appreciate comments from those of you who've had good results with  this product on what you did right that I may have done wrong and how to fix it.<br /><br />\<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006348H2">Pet Greens Garden Wheat Grass Self-Grow Kit</a>

review/summary: My Cats Adore This Grass
review/text: In the spring and summer this grass grows with no problem and no sun. It is an absolute miracle to watch. I plant this grass in a plastic planter box and water it just a bit to get the grass started. After a few days it sprouts and then within a few more days it grows three or more inches. Eventually it grows to about six inches and then starts to wilt. Of course by then the cats have had a feeding frenzy and the grass is all torn up and ready to be pulled up. One bag of seeds lasts me through the summer and I plant new seeds about every two to three weeks. So far I've never had problems with this company's seeds but if you are nervous buy some first from a pet store. One thing I do that might be the reason I have success with these seeds is I spread them out on the soil and then barely cover them with a thin layer of soil. I also water them about twice before they sprout. I just think it is amazing that this grass grows without any direct sunlight. My cats adore this grass and I'm sure your cats will too.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S. I moved to a place with full sun on a patio and this grass grew much differently with sun. I almost think it grows<br />better in a shaded area.

review/summary: Don't buy it from these folks
review/text: Purchased 5 of these since my local pet store was out & I've never had a problem with it in the 6 -7 years we've been growing cat grass - specifically this brand. Bought it as a Christmas gift for the cats. Planted seed from first package, very skimpy germination. Figured, OK one package may be bad, no big deal. Planted again from a different package, same result. Remember - we've been growing this cat grass for years using the same type of soil in the same type of pots w/out a problem.<br /><br />Contacted the seller about the issue & no dice, too bad - since it was literally a few days past the 30 day no questions asked return policy. Of course it took additional time for the seller to reply to my initial email but they would not take that into account either.<br /><br />So - went & bought the exact same type & manufacturer of grass seed at the pet store & guess what? Germination within days (as is usual w/this brand) and lots of it!<br /><br />I have no idea how they store this product but whatever they do, it ruins the seed. Please - go someplace else for this. Just to bad I can't start with a negative star rating.
