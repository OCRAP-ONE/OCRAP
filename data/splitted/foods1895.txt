review/summary: A whiff of caramel everytime I open the container
review/text: Oh man..these taste like candy. I could probably eat the whole container in one sitting - they're that delicious. But something bad would probably happen if I ate that much...like plants growing out of my armpits. As a caramel chew its very light, not at all chewy, rather more like soft chocolate fudge consistency with a bit of cake icing texture. Somewhat leaves a slippery residue on the roof of my mouth that goes away pretty quick (most likely the sugar or corn syrup in it). These make a great replacement for candy while I'm at work.

review/text: I decided to buy these to reduce the possibilities of having high cholesterol on my next blood test from my annual exam. I eat 5 per day.  The taste is great although I get a slick feel in my mouth after eating them, but it is not annoying. These are soft chews and similar in texture and taste to a caramel. I recommend them.

review/summary: Melted?
review/text: The chews have helped me change my cholesterol and fat numbers for the better. I've ordered 3 containers from Amazon. The first two were great. When I opened the third batch, the wrappers on the chews were slightly sticky. The chews themselves were different from my first two experiences in that they were waxy and opaque on the surface. The waxy/stickiness made them difficult to unwrap and I tend to just have to squeeze them out of the wrapper. I'm guessing they were stored/transported at too high a temperature and melted at some point but really have no idea. I'm hoping that my next order is not like this one. We'll see.

I also used the Benecol margarine and made some diet modifications, so can't say that the chews made all the difference, but they are tasty and a little sweet treat (without a lot of calories) after a meal. I have recommended them to my friends who want to lower their cholesterol.

It runs in my family.  I don't want to have any health issues now that I'm getting older, so I thought I would try this out.  My family doctor was optimistic and said to give it three months before getting tested since it takes that long to process in your body and show a significant change.  If all looks well in January, I will DEFINITELY buy more of these!

review/summary: A good option to lower your cholesterol
review/text: I was diagnosed with high cholesterol earlier this year.  300 total, and low HDL level.  I took some aggressive steps to adjust my diet and to start exercising more, and began taking phytosterols.  But I came across many reports that warned how sterols passed through the colon and could accumulate in the arteries much like cholesterol.  Stanols, on the other hand, are not absorbed in the colon, yet provided the same protection from cholesterol.  So I switched to Benecol.  I used their margarine because the Chews weren't available since March, but it looks like they finally started stocking the Chews again.  FYI, my last checkup showed a 20% drop in total cholesterol, and my HDL/total ratio is up to 4:1, which my doctor said is good.  I'm hoping my next checkup will be even better.<br /><br />BTW, be careful of misinformation from reviewers.  Sterols and stanols are not the same, and the literature bears this fact out.  Do your own research, and read CAREFULLY, and use your best judgement.  Eat well, exercise, have a glass of red wine every night :) and find supplements that can help.  Avoid statins if at all possible!

They are very tasty - easy to take with you and since you chew them, you don't need to find water to take them when you are out.  They taste just like a very soft caramel.  Hopefully they lower my cholesterol as well as capsule plant sterols have in the past.  Once I take a blood test, I will post results and let everyone know.  Really convenient and great product.

review/summary: I'm a believer!
review/text: I had blood work done & for the first time I was told I had high cholesterol. After doing some searching online, I came across Benecol Chews. Rave reviews made me give them a try. After a little less then 2 months I had my cholesterol checked again. My total cholesterol went from 215 down to 205 and my LDL went from 144 down to 129. Keep in mind I made little to no change in my diet so I know these changes were from taking Benecol. Aside from the numbers, which is the most important part, the chews are tasty. Not too sweet, taste like caramel & aren't tough. Sometimes they can leave a little bit of a residue in the mouth but that quickly goes away with a drink. I grew to get used to it. They are actually a nice treat after meals (one you know is good for you!). Amazon makes it so easy with the automatic shipments. I never have to worry about running out. And after the change in numbers, I never want to be without them! For those on statins, the package states you can safely take these. If you're looking for an easy way to help improve your numbers, definately give these a try!

review/text: Benecol Smart Chews is a terrific product. It has an effect on cholesterol levels and it tastes good. It may seem like a petty complaint, but I am so tired of taking pills, and I already take a lot of them. Being able to have some positive effect on my health by popping a couple of these Benecol Smart Chews is wonderful!<br /><br />Add this to the Mediterranean diet and a bit of exercise and you'll be contributing to maintaining your health! That's certainly worth trying.

review/summary: Great taste and simple to use
review/text: I just received my first order of the Benecol smart chews and they tast great. A nice smooth caramel texture that melts in your mouth.<br /><br />OK, so compared to most of the other posts, my cholesterol levels are not too high but my doctor says it's high. One of my biggest problems is keeping my HDL (good) greater than 40. So when I read the Benecol website and it said this would help lower my LDL (Bad) and not my HDL I thought why not try them out. I already eat well balanced meals and walk 5 times a week for 30 minutes. In addition, prior to my most recent blood test I was able to loose 15lbs. Now at 5'2" I weight my ideal weight of 110lbs. Yet my cholesterol levels have not gone down.<br /><br />My last test was on 10/28/08<br />TOTAL CHOLESTEROL = 214 goal less than 200<br />HDL CHOLESTEROL = 40 goal greater than 40<br />LDL CHOLESTEROL = 145 goal less than 130<br />TRIGLYCERIDES = 146 goal less than 150<br /><br />My next test will not be until April so I plan on adding all bran to my breakfast and taking 3 Benecol chews a day. I will update you with my results in April 2009. If they do manage to reduce my numbers I will be more than willing to give this product 5 stars.

review/summary: Cholestrol Dropped over 50 points
review/text: I have been taking this product for the past 12 months.  Not only is it simple to take and easy on the taste buds, but as you will read also much more effective than I ever thought it would be.  In addition, I have been taking direct source of milk thistle and tudca powder, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TJXMBS">FREE Milk Thistle Powder 25 Grams + TUDCA Powder (Tauroursodeoxycholic) 5 Grams</a>. I am forty-two years old and exercise regularly and eat moderately healthy.<br /><br />I recently took a physical for a new position I acquired with a huge company and my total cholesterol was 149.  I was completely taken off guard by hearing this number because the last time I had my cholesterol checked was three years ealrier and my total cholesterol at that time was over 200.  I was 39 then, and in much better shape physically than I currently am.  It is true what they say that the metabolism takes a sharp decline at 40, not joke there!<br /><br />I assumed my cholesterol must have been at least somewhat lower but I had no idea that such a drastic change would occur.  I believe these Benecol Smart Chews along with the recommended dose of milk thistle and Tudca have played a big part in this incredible drop from a once 200+ cholesterol rating. I haven't grew any younger and my lifestyle is pretty much the same as it was three years ago (if not a little more relaxed) so needless to say, these are products I can highly recommend without prejudice.

review/summary: Benecol Caramel Chews
review/text: Not wanting to resort to "drugs" to manage Cholesterol, I did some research on plant Stanols, and plant Sterols. They both seem to have the ability to lower the cholesterol in your blood.  However, based on a Johns Hopkins health alert....plant sterols tend to lose their ability to lower cholesterol, and instead start to appear in the blood them selves. Where as plant STANOLS seem to stay active and continue to lower cholesterol.  BENECOL is the only off the shelf item that contains stanols instead of sterols. The Benecol spread is good and tastes fine, but the caramel chews are portable so you can easily take them with you. I would recommend the chews to anyone who wants to keeps tabs on your cholesterol....they are reasonably inexpensive, taste good, and have STANOLS in them...and they are portable.  I was able to lower my cholesterol by 80 points by consumming STANOLS and watching my intake of cholesterol....

review/summary: Amazing results with a combination of Benecol, oatmeal & no dairy
review/text: Last spring, I had borderline high LDL (146, where it should be less than 130).  I started using this product in May 2011, but unfortunately, as I was traveling over the summer, I wasn't as good about taking it as I should have been.  My goal was to take it 3x a day, but in foreign countries, in the heat on the road, the little squares would often get melty and smashed in my small travel fanny pack, and then weren't very palatable, so often I only had 1 per day, not optimum.  When I came back from traveling in September, I had my cholesterol checked, and it was 136.  Lower, but not below the magic number of 130.  On September 12 I made a pledge to take the chews 3-4 times per day, and then recheck my cholesterol again in late November.  Full disclosure:  I also added in 1/2 cup of oatmeal every day because I had read this can lower cholesterol.  I also cut all dairy products, but did not cut out red meat, which I eat 2-4 days a week.  My diet was basically oatmeal (but no other carbs) fruits, lots of veggies of every sort, beef, pork, chicken and fish, with no dairy and very low sugar.  It was very similar to my diet before (when LDL cholesterol was at 146), but without the dairy products.  I was hoping that the combination of the 1 serving of oatmeal, no dairy and 3-4 Benecol chews per day would lower my cholesterol 15 points or so.  Was I EVER surprised when I saw the results... in a late November cholesterol check, my LDL was down to 81... a drop (from the May reading of 146) 65 points!!!!  Now granted, it's not clear how much of the result was from the Benecol, how much was from the oatmeal, and how much was from the no dairy/no sugar.  But I feel confident that the Benecol is definitely a big part of the success.  I will definitely keep using this product.  My only complaint is what is noted in the beginning of this review; if you are traveling it is hard to remember to take it at all the meals, and if you carry it around with you, it tends to get soft and squishy.  If you put in into a small hard container (like a medium-sized plastic pill bottle, or a square plastic soap container) that would prevent it getting squished.  You just have to remember to grab 3-4 each morning out of your suitcase and bring them with you each day.

review/summary: Inconsistent Dosage Recommendations
review/text: I just started using this, so I can't comment on how well it will work to lower my cholesterol, but I want to alert people to inconsistencies in the labeling. The 120-count package is supposed to be a two month supply. On the front of the box it says "take twice a day to reduce cholesterol." If you consumed two per day there would indeed be a 60-day supply in the box. On the back it says, ". . . can help you meet the National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines recommended amount of 2 g plant stanols/sterols per day. To meet this recommendation, enjoy 5 chews per day."<br /><br />Each candy as 0.7 g of stanol in it, so if you had 5 a day you'd be getting 3.5 g, not 2. If you want to get around 2 g per day you have to take three of them (2.1 g), which means 120 of them won't last 60 days. (And if you consume them at a rate of five a day you won't even have enough for a month.)<br /><br />The research says the minimum effective dose is 0.8 to 1 g per day, and the maximum is 2 g per day; therefore, there's no reason to have more than three of these a day, and less than two a day probably won't do any good. Natural sources of phytosterols don't come anywhere near the recommended intake. For example, a half cup of wheat germ has 197 mg of phytosterols.<br /><br />They are soft, pleasantly flavored, small, and only 20 calories each. I think they're worth a try.

review/summary: Helped lower my cholesterol without side effects
review/text: Statins caused me muscle pain, joint cramping and headaches.  My cholesterol was 244 and my doctor said I needed to get it down.  I started exercising every day (with the Shapely Girl DVD's which are low impact and easy to do), started eating healthy (with advice from a nutritionist at my doctor's office), and started taking 3 Benecol Smart Chews after dinner every evening.  3 weeks later, my cholesterol was down to 222.  3 months later, it was down to 185.  The Benecol.com website says you can take 1-2 chews twice a day with meals, or 3-4 all at once with a meal:<br /><br />"Plant stanol esters should be ingested at meal times, because this is the prime time when fat and cholesterol in the diet is absorbed into the intestinal wall. Stanols are absorbed in place of cholesterol into the intestinal lining and also cause cholesterol to be secreted back into the intestine.  Studies show that peak benefits are derived with a stanol intake of approximately 2g per day...Studies also showed that once-a-day with a meal is sufficient as a daily dose of plant stanol ester, and that consuming the stanol as a food ingredient but not as part of a meal was not as effective."<br /><br />Benecol Smart Chews have no scary side effects because they simply pass through the intestine, but if you eat too many, you can get diarrhea.  The chews are carefully wrapped in foil so it takes a minute or two to unwrap 3 of them, perhaps to discourage children who might think they are caramel candy, or adults from accidentally eating too many.  Each chew has .7g of plant stanols, so you need to eat 3 a day to get the recommended dose of approximately 2g per day.  Benecol lowers cholesterol up to 14% in just 3 weeks.  I am glad I found the Smart Chews here at Amazon.com as they are only available online.

review/summary: Lower Cholestrol
review/text: I had my cholesterol Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120 Soft Chews checked in January of 2007 and it read 270 and trigl. was 145.  I was rechecked in August of 2007 and my cholesterol was 206, but the trigl. went to 300.  I just spoke to my endocrinology doctor and he believes the trigl. elevation has to do with my intake of sugar and losing weight, exercise.<br />I will be tested in another 3 months for cholesterol level.

review/text: For a health product, why does this contain high fructose corn syrup ? The additive provides no value to a person and according to current research may actually be harmful. Benecol should offer it sugar free. If Coke & Pepsi can offer sugar free products, why can't Benecol ?

review/summary: Reality Check -- Cost vs. Questionable Benefit
review/text: [As evidenced by the 'Not Helpful' votes on this review, folks apparently don't want to hear what I point out below (the idea of popping a candy-like caramel to save your heart is just TOO appealing), but I'm going to keep this review available for the rationalists out there.]<br /><br />I purchased a couple boxes of these and enjoyed them for several months. They are convenient, they taste great, and supposedly they're good for my health -- what's not too like? Eventually, I uncovered three problems:<br /><br />1) My physician mentioned something I hadn't realized: 75% of the cholesterol in our bodies is synthesized BY our bodies. Only 25% is ingested through food. Then I read a WebMD article ("Cholesterol Control: The Alternatives") which mentioned that plant sterols/stanols like Benecol only block absorption of about 10% of the cholesterol in the food we eat. So essentially, these Smart Chews are blocking 10% of 25%. I'll do the math for you... we're blocking 2.5% of total cholesterol. Surprisingly, you'll find other reviewers reporting much larger cholesterol drops, but then it turns out they've changed their diet, gone on statins, started exercising, or introduced other confounding factors... These are wildy uncontrolled experiments from which it is impossible to draw cause-effect conclusions.<br /><br />2) The whole idea behind this product is based on the "diet-heart hypothesis" -- which is the scientific name for the idea that eating cholesterol causes heart disease. At this point, nearly every reputable scientist in the field has dismissed this idea. Ancel Keys -- the father of this hypothesis in the 1940s -- said in 1997: "There's no connection whatsoever between the cholesterol in food and cholesterol in the blood. . .Cholesterol in the diet doesn't matter at all unless you happen to be a chicken or a rabbit." (A reference to the inability of certain animals to process dietary cholesterol). Most researchers now believe the primary causes of heart disease are inflammation and oxidative stress. So what exactly are we doing here with these Benecol chews?<br /><br />3) This might be my own weakness, but I found myself sporadically eating things that I would never normally touch. The guys at work are going for fried chicken? Sure I'll join them -- why not! I'll just pop a Benecol and feel better about it. It was a strange "enabler" of bad eating behavior.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm not sure there is much benefit here, but there certainly is cost! If you want to improve your HDL/LDL ratio (without a prescription statin), you would derive much more benefit from a natural statin (e.g. red yeast rice) which will lower your LDL, or Niacin which will boost your HDL. The key here is that both these approaches act on the more important side of the cholesterol equation: the body's production.

review/summary: Good for Lowering Cholesterol, But Do Not Like "new shape"!
review/text: I always liked Benecol Smart Chews and I looked forward to taking them.  They are not only good for lowering cholesterol(My reports have told me so), but they also tasted good.  It was just like a caramel candy and it was square and dry and chewy.  I do not like the new taste and new shape.  It is long and narrow.  I can't even get the foil off without tearing it apart.  It is sticky and oily.  I do not enjoy them anymore.  I gave it only three stars.  I suppose they still work to lower cholesterol, but I will not be buying them anymore, because I do not like the new shape and taste and feel. If Benecol Smart Chews go back to the former shape and taste, I will give it a higher rating and continue to buy them.

review/summary: Benecol Benefit
review/text: My experiment was a success!<br /><br />I ate like a pig and took two Benecol chews a day and ate oatmeal intermittently. Unlike my experiment with Colest Off I made no  attempt to be a vegetarian. The results were still promising and show that the Benecol Chews are a potent force in lowering Total Cholesterol.<br /><br />My Total Cholesterol with no supplements and no diet change is a scary 287, with Colest Off and a partial vegetarian diet my total cholesterol  is about 197 with a good ratio of HDL to LDL. The Benecol Chews reduced my total to an unimpressive 237, but considering that I ate high cholesterol foods this shows the potency of plant STANOLs.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CD0W8U">CholestOff 240 cplts</a>

review/summary: Taste is ok but texture is yucky
review/text: My doctor wants me on statins but I think the possible side effects are<br />worse than the cholesterol the drugs treat.  These chews sound like a great idea.  The taste is ok - not great but ok.  However, the texture is yucky.  One reviewer said waxy but to me it's more like slimey and the slimey feeling stays after the chew is gone.  I've only had a few so far<br />and I really don't know if I can make it through the bag much less order them again.  The chews may lower cholesterol but only if you can tolerate them and I don't think I'll be able to do that.  I think the company needs to rework the formula.  It's back to the drawing board for me.<br />Amazon's service was great (as it usually is).  They came fast and in perfect condition so it's only the product that I'm complaining about.<br />I just had another one and actually I'm not too happy with the taste either.

Yes, they will lower your cholesterol but cholesterol may in fact be the least of your problems. [...]<br /><br />There are multiple recent studies showing the possibility that this stuff is collecting in your arteries. The fact that this company does not mention this possible danger is disgusting. A few years back they cut in half the amount of stanols in their margarine, possibly aware of the possibility they were damaging millions of hearts. PLEASE HEED THIS WARNING. Unfortunately, I only recently found out about it.<br /><br />Also, you may notice you're developing xanthelasma around your eyes.<br /><br />Update: I've just received my blood tests back. I have significantly elevated campesterol levels which could only come from taking this product. This puts me at a much higher risk of heart attack.
