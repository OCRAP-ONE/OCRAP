review/text: I bought Grand Arome by Poulain in France in 2001 and love it!  Everytime anyone from my family goes back to France, this is the one item I ask them to bring back to me.  I find that, not only is it delicious, but when I have one mug full of hot cocoa in the morning with two pieces of toast, that I don't get hungry again all morning.  I actually lose weight when I stick to this for breakfast.  What a great treat, and with such good benefits.

review/summary: Buyer beware, Proctor & Gamble has ruined this food!
review/text: My girlfriend and I have been rescuing, fostering, and adopting out (through a rescue group) cats and kittens for over 10 years. We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy. So we're very experienced in all aspects of cat care, and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods. The foods are more expensive, but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions!<br /><br />We had been using Innova Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food for several years, once we discovered that it included no by-products, corn filler, or other junk ingredients. Our cats loved the food, which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety.<br /><br />Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months. We heard that Proctor & Gamble, manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods, had purchased Natura Pet Products, maker of the Innova, Healthwise, and California Natural brands, among others. Proctor & Gamble has questionable pet food testing practices (search the internet for it), so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way. So we were very upset about P&G's purchase of Natura, but we stuck with the Innova Cat & Kitten food for the short run, hoping we could later find a better alternative.<br /><br />Well strangely enough, for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat & Kitten that we've purchased, something has changed. The food is much more "crumbly", i.e. there is a lot more "food dust" in the bags, and the kibble looks a little different. We didn't think much of this change until our cats, which had previously LOVED the Innova food, lost interest in it and really didn't want to eat it. In the dry food mix we make, we noticed that very often, the cats would eat the other part of the mix, and leave the Innova Cat & Kitten behind. Clearly there is something different about the way P&G manufactures this food, as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products.<br /><br />This is EXPENSIVE food, and for the money you pay, it should be TOP QUALITY. Well, it ISN'T anymore! We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls (which are usually totally empty after feeding time), and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover, unwanted.<br /><br />So that was it; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat & Kitten to the store we'd purchased them from, and will never buy this food again. In fact, we've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products, which include Healthwise and California Natural. We did find a good quality alternative cat food called "Simply Nourish", and when we tried it with our cats, they LOVED it. There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls, and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality.<br /><br />WARNING: For anyone currently purchasing "Innova Cat & Kitten", or planning to buy it in the future, we believe that P&G appears to have changed the way this food is made, for the worse. We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money, and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market. AVOID this food, it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it did before P&G bought Natura Pet Products, and ruined it!

When I saw them on Amazon, I thought it would be a super savings.  However, these cookies must be fresh, or they are simply not worth eating.  The photo above is a very good sample of some very old and dried out cookies.  When they were received in fresh condition, they were excellent, with soft moist cake and marshmallow and a chocolate coating that was a solid, shiney dark brown.  In this photo above you can see a very dried out product with an old and  pale, discolored coating.  I ordered 3 seperate times, 1st box was "great"  other two were not even edible.  1 FOR 3 MAKES THEM A VERY POOR VALUE.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005XOQZC">Nabisco Snack Wells Creme Sandwich Cookies 1.7 oz.

review/text: I could eat a devils food cake a day. . .but then, I'd be so big I would require my own zip code.  So I'm darn glad the folks at Nabisco came up with SNACKWELL'S DEVILS FOOD COOKIES.  These are the real deal:  a little devils food cake, surrounded by a marshmellow layer, covered in chocolate.  Zero fat, zero cholesterol, only 50 calories--but this little snack sure doesn't taste like no fat/no cholesterol.  It tastes like sheer indulgence, and that's always a good thing.<br /><br />So I always keep a box around when the sweet tooth starts to take over and I'm needing some guilt-free pleasure.  SNACKWELL'S DEVILS FOOD COOKIES.  Devilishly good.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

review/summary: Loaded with sugars and contains undeclared fats; not a health food
review/text: People, learn how to read nutrition labels. Servings are typically divided into just one or two cookies. Two cookies contain about 100 calories, 24 g carbohydrates and 14 g sugars. The calorie breakdown is over 90% carbohydrates, mostly from sugars. This is a BIG red flag. No one should consume junk like this. Don't be misled by the "Fat Free" label. (see second paragraph) Refined sugars are far, far worse for dieters than fats are; poly- and monounsaturated fats are in fact beneficial, and calories from fat provide more stable energy. With the exception of trans and saturated fats, (they raise bad cholesterol) you really shouldn't be on a low-fat diet. Sugars are the worst thing for dieters, as they aren't as likely to be metabolized as energy, and will typically be stored as body fat. (mostly around the mid-section) High-fructose corn syrup (an ingredient in SnackWell's products) is specifically linked with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. The human body simply is not meant to metabolize this much sugar, nor sugars that are unnaturally processed. I can't provide links to research on the subject, because Amazon has rather ridiculous policies that censor URLs, names of other sites, stores, competitors, etc. from reviews. Be sure to complain to Amazon.com about this practice. Still, it's easy enough to open a search engine and type "snackwell devil food nutrition facts" or the like.<br /><br />Bear in mind that products are not required to declare nutritional content when the servings are divided into small portions, and the content would be less than 0.5 g. Each cookie actually contains 0.17 g saturated fat, which Nabisco neglects to mention. Trans fat content is entirely unaccounted for, though it may actually exist. This means that "Fat Free" claim was just a blatant lie. Will anyone hold Nabisco responsible for unscrupulously deceiving consumers, though? Can anyone demand that they pull misleading products off the shelf? Nope. Welcome to corporate America.<br /><br />Don't let Nabisco and other "health-conscience" snack companies scam you. Read labels closely, and be suspicious of small servings. If a single serving contains less than 0.5 g trans fat, then it doesn't have to be declared; the label will inaccurately specify 0 g. If the portions seem ridiculously small, then it's safe to assume they're trying to hide something from the consumer.<br /><br />On a side note, please ignore "helpful review" ratings. Re-distributors of products will often vote down critical reviews, because they demote the very products they're trying to sell on Amazon. It's all politics.

review/summary: A good deal?
review/text: I love these cookies, generally, and the price is great here on Amazon, but sometimes I question where they come from.  In March, I received a shipment (TWELVE boxes) with an expiration date of 12 March 2011.  I thought that was kinda "iffy", and the cookies were a bit worn (they had that patina of old chocolate), but they were edible, so, okay.  In April, the expiration date was sometime in the far future (September or October of 2011), so I figured the March shipment was a fluke.  In May, the expiration date was *again* 12 March 2011!!  They were PAST expiration.<br /><br />Of course, I'm a carb freak so that didn't stop me from eating them, but, C'MON!!  I'm almost scared to get my next shipment.

Granted, they are not the best cookies (that title belongs to Keebler's Soft Batch) but they are certainly an excellent substitute for those who like to eat cookies and not worry too much about weight. They're quite expensive at the stores (between $3.5-4.5 a box) so I ordered them in bulk from Amazon which bought per box cost down to $2.50.

review/summary: Not a ringer for Nabisco!
review/text: I can't speak for anyone else, but I am most definitely not a spokesperson for Nabisco!  I love these cookies.  They are super yummy,not too sweet, not too "blah."  They do not taste like a "diet" cookie.  I like these as well, probably better, than your normal, everyday "who cares about weight" cookie.<br /><br />I will say this.  I am not a fan of marshmallow.  I don't like marshmallow peeps, marshmallow in cookies, marshmallow "moon pies," any of that. I DO however, like the marshmallow in these cookies.  So that said, it means the marshmallow in the Snackwells is very different than what you find in the above-mentioned snack/sweets.  Therefore if you do like the peeps, moonpies, etc., you may or may not like the Snackwells.  However, the marshmallow is such a small part of this cookie, I don't think it will matter.  The star of this show is the fudgy chocolate.<br /><br />For the person who felt the cookies were bad, I wonder if there could have been a small hole in the packaging and they were, in fact, stale.  I don't typically have any sitting around long enough to go stale, but when I do, they do lose their positive attributes!<br /><br />I think my only "complaint" about this cookie is the fact they are so good, I end up eating too many, taking away any advantage of the fewer calories they contain.

review/summary: Wonderful dog food, good price
review/text: This dog food was recommended by our standard poodle's breeder.  She feeds it to both her breeding dogs and her show dogs.  Our dog loves it, and eats every bit of his breakfast, lunch and dinner right down.<br /><br />The breeder said for us to mix the food with a little warm water and a tablespoon of plain, unflavored, nonfat yogurt.  My vet agreed, and said that the yogurt was an excellent addition.  He also has standard poodles as his personal pets.<br /><br />As poodle owners know, the breed can be susceptible to a horrible stomach condition called "bloat."  Feeding your poodle a top grade dog food on a regular schedule is very important for these lovely animals.  This dog food fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />It is interesting that this is an adult dog food, but the kibble is smallish, and if mixed with the warm water while the dog is a puppy, it can be used throughout the dog's life, once he/she is weaned.  You do not need a puppy chow when the dog is young.<br /><br />This seller provides this food at a fair price, and ships promptly.<br /><br />Recommended.

Because sometimes the online stores sell fake stuff. I followed the directions and even tried it without ice to see if I would like it better. Well it tastes horrible, I can describe it as unsweetened kool-aid fruit punch with a chemical taste like splenda sugar or something. Avoid this, I believe they had changed the formula. I was reading old and recent reviews and it seems it used to be tasty till they changed the formula and tastes like crap. You have been warned guys.

review/summary: Get FRESH PESTO instead
review/text: I purchased this item from a market because my local Costco ran out of their store brand Kirkland Signature pesto. Roland Pesto is disgusting and inferior; this brand has ruined meals. Go for the fresh stuff in the refrigerated section of supermarket instead. Or if you are a Costco member, look for their Kirkland Signature Pesto.

review/summary: According to Boccaccio...
review/text: ... the herb basil - 'basilico' - got its name from a tale of tragic romance, in which a young damsel concealed the severed head of her illicit lover, Basilio, in a pot of basil, which she watered with her tears. (I think it was Boccaccio, but it doesn't matter...) The relevance of the story is that basil is extremely easy to grow, even in a large patio pot or a window-box. And now it has become available fresh in supermarkets from sea to shining sea. So there's no reason or excuse for 'making do' with jars or tubes of adulterated gunk.<br /><br />Here's how to make it for yourself: finely chop two large bunches of fresh basil, discarding the thick stems. Mince a whole head of fresh garlic. Pound or chop a handful of pine nuts; some people prefer blanched walnuts. Mash these three together in a mortar or a food mill. Mix in your preferred olive oil; no other oil will do. Let the pesto sit a while; a layer of olive oil should rise to the top; if not, add more olive oil, and make sure that the pesto is sealed from the air by it. With this oil seal, it will keep in a refrigerator for weeks. When you need the pesto, mix grated parmagianno or a similar hard Italian cheese into the pesto before using it. The quality of the cheese DOES matter a lot.<br /><br />Pesto is traditionally used on thin pastas, on gnocchi, and in soup. The French 'potage au pistou' is an example. The flavor of basil doesn't survive high temperatures; cooked pesto, on pizza for instance, is basically just oily garlic. Once you've made your own pesto and tasted it, you'll never be interested in the stuff in jars except for backpacking trips.

review/summary: Amazing price for tasty salt
review/text: At $1.6 per pound (for a recurring order), this natural coarse sea salt cannot be beat (far cheaper than then Costco equivalent).  It tastes like... salt, but I actually prefer the flavor to that of the pure Brazilian sea salt we had been using.  It will take about 20 years to go through 8.8 pounds, but it will keep just fine in the four sealed plastic bags in which it comes.  This salt is not organic (organic salt seems a bit nonsensical to me), but is sun dried without additives.  Obviously, a salt grinder is required for this coarse salt.  All around, we are very happy with the purchase.

review/summary: The Bursting Flavor and Healing Power of Blessedly Beautiful, Simple Salt Crystals
review/text: These coarse crystals have the minerals intact, which is vital to the salt benefit and function.<br /><br />I don't know when or why purveyors of salt began removing the natural mineral content, but that action involved a frightening ignorance.<br /><br />For certain types of specific health issues (see below), the minerals in the sea salt crystals seem to work better for me in their crystalline (or coarse) form, than when I grind the salt, as I do for cooking or table usage salt.<br /><br />As others have noted, mineral-rich, coarse-sea-salt freshly grinded onto food is much crisper in its culinary effect, more satisfying to the taste buds, than pre-granulated, plain table salt (which has the minerals removed, minerals found naturally in sea salt and which enhance both health benefits and flavor bursts).<br /><br />Also, old style, granulated table salt has an added disadvantage from the fairly recent addition of a variety of anti-caking chemicals, some of which contain aluminum (silicoaluminate)... which I'm concerned may be a brain cell deteriorative, possibly at baseline cause for Alzheimer's.<br /><br />If I take a pinch of salt crystals (coarse sea salt contains crystals) 2 or sometimes 4 times per day, and place them in my mouth, moving them around to dissolve the salt in saliva on my teeth and gums, I find that both teeth and gums retain a much higher degree of health.  I had begun having minor tooth aches periodically, and this practice has alleviated that.<br /><br />As noted above, I'm 60-years-old; and with a debilitating liver ailment since I was 9, I find that when I have an attack of severe abdominal and back muscle cramps (which I get fairly frequently), a pinch of sea salt crystals in my mouth will stop those cramps.  In fact, when I take small amounts of sea salt crystals regularly enough, I don't get those cramps at all.  The cause and effect is immediate and direct, so I know this works for me.  From my experience, plain table salt, or even sea salt without the mineral content will not give this beneficial effect.  (I'm guessing it's the magnesium content which works here, though, it might be the wholeness of the natural balance of the particular mineral group within unadulterated salt).<br /><br />Of course, I also drink one, preferably two glasses of water along with the salt crystals, ingesting the water before, after, or both.<br /><br />I learned about the many benefits of sea salt crystals (with the natural mineral content not having been leached away in well meaning ignorance) from Dr. Batmanghelidj's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970245823">Obesity Cancer & Depression: Their Common Cause & Natural Cure</a>.  I recommend that book very highly and hope to be able to review it also.<br /><br />Dr Batman's books explain how, when, why, and how much water the body needs for optimum health, and sea salt crystals are a vital part of that program.<br /><br />Note that in this book he explains also how, when, and why a person can take too much salt and water. I suppose I'm "lucky" that I have a barometer for sea salt crystal needs.  When I'm not taking enough the cramps return.  During hot weather (or under other dehydrating conditions) when the body loses more salt and water, I have to increase the intake of both.<br /><br />As far as I recall, Dr. Batman hadn't mentioned the connection of sea salt to alleviate regular large muscle cramping.  That I discovered this on my own after I had been taking the sea salt regularly, due to reading Dr. Batman's book.<br /><br />Bless this man for standing up to so many medical fallacies which are literally creating diseases, then causing addiction to high cost medications which do NOT cure the ailment, but add several other ailments into a complex medical condition which piles prescriptions on top of prescriptions.<br /><br />My thanks to Amazon for providing a variety of excellent sea salt products in coarse, crystalline form.<br /><br />With Respect for the maverick M.D.'s who actually apply and teach true healing,<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books on KINDLE and Amazon Shorts

review/summary: How can you give salt a bad review?
review/text: Not much to say...this was an excellent buy for an excellent product.  Purchasing coarse sea salt in a local specialty store would have cost me about $5 for 4-6 ounces; when you do the math, that's more than 4 times the price of this product.  Even though I don't think i'll use up all 2.2 pounds of sea salt in the next few years, if kept in a cool, dry place, it should last indefinitely without losing flavor.<br /><br />I use this salt in one of the grinders I purchased from Amazon (see my other reviews for that product).  This salt works very well in that grinder.  I would certainly buy more of this salt and will do so, when I eventually run out.

review/text: 20 years ago when I was a kid, handi snacks were *extremely* popular.  All the kids had them, and for an affordable price, parents didn't mind giving in and buying them.  Now however, things have changed.  They are no longer popular.  Not that it matters or anything, but what does certainly matter is that the size of the crackers have shrunk considerably.  No it's not just because I'm an adult now that it appears they're smaller, they really *are* smaller.  Also, I'm just going to pretend I'm not seeing a 40-dollar price tag for a box of 8.  Hopefully that's incorrect and it's just a glitch or the seller made a mistake in actually charging that much.  Totally not worth it.

review/text: The Pomi tomatoes are a fine product, and worth the extra expense.  Their taste and texture are far superior to those of canned tomatoes, and frankly, most fresh tomatoes most of the year.<br /><br />My complaint is that the Pomi cartons were sloppily and loosely packed, and thus vulnerable to damage during shipping.  They were packed more as common household goods rather than food.  If the shipping box had been more banged up than it was, one or more of the Pomi cartons could have been ruptured.  This is an easy problem to fix; I hope Amazon takes note of it, and takes steps to prevent its happening again.

review/summary: Great product and BPA-FREE!
review/text: I had been using Muir Glen Organic whole/diced tomatoes, but after having had cancer I read a lot of research publications indicating that BPA's estrogen mimicking effects can be quite dangerous. BPA found in cans with acidic foods are some of the worst since the chemical is leached out even more. The same is true of plastic containers with BPA -- acid, heat or surface abrasion lead to much greater leaching into the food.<br /><br />Although Muir Glen is promising to get rid of BPA in their can liners, they are replacing it with some unspecified 'vinyl-based substitute'. If you want to get their cans without BPA, look for a use-by date of around the summer of 2013. [This info is per a conversation with their customer service representative.]<br /><br />I had heard about Pomi Tetra-pak products before -- Mario Batali and other foodies/chefs have recommended them so I thought I would give them a try.<br /><br />The tomatoes are naturally grown in Italy without pesticides and have no salt added. I used them to create a wonderful marinara sauce. They taste great and I am very happy with the quality.

Definitely has a lighter, less-salty flavor compared to the regular variety, but still has flavor to it. Good for people on a low-sodium diet.

review/summary: Solid mint not 'extra strong' as advertised
review/text: These are great mini jaw breaker like mints that have a good mint taste. They last a long time in your mouth and a strong but not overpowering mint taste. Think off them of as having a mint taste slightly stronger than Tic-Tacs and not as strong a mint taste as peppermint Altoids. The Jila Mints last much longer in your mouth than either Tic-Tacs or Altoids. I think they are great and wish they were more widely available in the US.

review/summary: 2 Stars is kind for this insulting brew
review/text: I normally buy several bags of the Starbucks Christmas coffee.  Could not find any this year, but my heart picked up when I saw there was a Via version.  I like the Italian Via - regular and decaf - so much that I actually buy it at the ridiculous prices Starbucks charges.  I got two boxes of the Christmas Via in early December.  Still have one. Hard to figure why this is labeled "Christmas" as it tastes nothing like the good stuff in the bags.  Hard to figure how coffee can be weak and bitter with no character - and as this is "Christmas" no spicyness - at the same time.  Groaned my way through the first box and keep giving the second a wide pass.  Maybe hoping it will get better with age?  May just dump on the azaleas in the Spring.

review/text: Big Starbucks fan, VIA fan, but this Christmas Blend VIA isn't very good for me.  Now, I'm not one of those super strong coffee people, but this is also a little bitter in my opinion.  I will say that if you use about 16 oz. and some milk and some vanilla, it's okay.  I see now why they were having a sale on it at Starbucks.<br /><br />I'd got with the Caramel VIA instead, that's the bomb, as is the Vanilla.

review/summary: Perfect for low carb/high fat diets
review/text: If you are practicing any type of low carb diet (keto, atkins, etc), this is THE perfect milk substitute.<br /><br />This is higher in fat than unsweetened almond milk, with a lower carbohydrate profile (if I remember correctly, it's 1 gram per serving). Another nice thing about this product, is that they are generous with their labled serving sizes. The label says 4 servings per box but I get about 6.<br /><br />Since it's coconut based, it is packed with medium-chain fatty acids and has a sweet tropical taste. Also can be stored without refrigeration until opened.<br /><br />I personally prefer this over all other milk substitutes.<br /><br />The per unit price seems a bit high considering you have to buy 12 at once, but very few stores carry the unsweetened variety (which is crucial to keto'ers) so I guess it's a supply/demand thing.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: We drink it for health reasons
review/text: After watching a recent show on foods can really lower your chances of cancer ~I was really suprised to see that coconut milk( water) was right on top of that list  ,even higher than the cruciferous vegtables! Next time I went shopping I picked this up  not sure if it is availablle at every store but probably more health oriented shops??)<br /><br />Now my husband and I drink about 1/2 C per day, we have not used it in cooking or baking, but I am not certain we will, as we are drinking it as is for reasons stated.<br /><br /> I cant say I love the stuff or if I will use it to flavor my tea  or his coffee) but it is an inexpensive way to get some added assurance for good health( we think)<br />It may be pricey if you use if for cereal or things like that .but we are very careful to take our D 3 vitamins, our omega 3's and our ground flaxseed everyday,( among other things) and this is a health choice for us~<br /><br />While I do cook from scratch and we have been working at growing most of our own veggies and fruits  We can them),,,, it is a deliberate choice at this time in our lives when we see so many friends w/ diabetes, the beginnnings of heart disease and other such illnesses who are not doing a THING to take care of themselves!  And believe me I know nothing is a guarantee b/c you can just get lousey genes too!) BUt,,,what they DO find out, it is worth it to us to incorporate into our dients~<br />Will this help?? Not sure yet. but the stats of cancer are very very low in countries that use and drink coconut juice ,which was pointed out to us on the show  these were Drs involved in research)<br />I can only hope all these things help... but I think it is unwise to eat well and then ingnore exercise time too ,,,DH is a marathoner  I am not, I am a swimmer) so we each do our own thing but we both walk a lot whenever weather allows<br />I will purchase this product again, , I want NO sweetners and no preservatatives , I just want my 1/2 - 1 Cup per day,<br />The biggest surprise was the carb count! One carb for 1/2 cup?? Now THAT is something that pleasese me also! I cant say I love this stuff from a taste point of view but I am getting used to it and will drink it every day from now on! Enjoy health living!

review/summary: What a relief!
review/text: I had been purchasing the So Delicious brand which has many more ingredients than this and must be refrigerated. I don't like their tetra-pak one. I saw this two weeks ago at our regular grocery store and delighted to see unsweetened with few additives. I happened to purchase one of the regualar flavor also and opened it without realizing I had done that. Despite the second ingredient being the sweetener it was not horribly cloying as so many of these types of products can be.<br /><br />It's nice to be able to chose something not just for the health benefits! As I commented on one of the other posts:  I purchase this for $3.51 at my regular grocery store (Publix). They will also order anything by the case for me, giving me 10% off regular retail price. Ask your store and they will definitely get it for you, especially if you say you will take the case. You will need the UPC code if they don't already have it listed through their suppliers.<br /><br />So, until Amazon starts carrying this themselves bringing us a more competitive price and better shipping that is where I will buy mine.

review/summary: Oooh, la la !!!
review/text: Folger's scores another coup with their awesome French Vanilla ground coffee. The taste is delicious. It keeps a long time in your kitchen cabinet or your freezer, too. If you do choose to keep it in your freezer, however, remember to let it thaw out a few hours before using.<br /><br />The canisters are very well constructed to keep the ground coffee fresh and the safety seal on the top of each unused canister gives you peace of mind. The packaging overall is excellent.<br /><br />But of course it's the coffee that we're really interested in here. The freshness of that distinct French Vanilla flavor strikes your taste buds and makes you really, REALLY want that second cup of coffee. It's a delicious way to wake up in the morning; and of course it's good at any time of the day or night as well.<br /><br />Obviously, coffee contains caffeine. If you are sensitive to caffeine in any way you might prefer to drink decaffeinated coffee instead of this product. If you have any questions at all about your specific medical situation consult your doctor.<br /><br />There's only one minor disappointment: the label says that this coffee contains "added natural and artificial flavors." I wish that Folger's had told us exactly what these ingredients are. That way people could make an even more informed decision about whether or not they would want to drink this coffee. I am taking off one star for this to make this a four star review. I truly believe in ingredient labels that tell what ALL the ingredients are and not just some of them.<br /><br />Overall, however, this is one great French Vanilla coffee. If you love French Vanilla flavored coffee you can't go wrong with the Folger's brand. If you like your coffee even a bit sweeter you can always add sugar or any sugar substitute.<br /><br />Vive la France!

review/text: I generally like vanilla flavoured beverages but I always take coffee black and unsweetened, I thought this would be a nice change and a combination of the 2.  Not so.  It just tasted .. well, wrong.  It tasted like weak custard which I guess is evidence that the french vanilla flavour is there but, for me, custard should remain a topping for apple pie, not in my coffee... LOL!  I do like Folger's Cappuccino flavoured beverages but as they are loaded with sugar I don't drink them that often and if I do I like them with cold with blended ice.  I have the hazelnut in this too which I find more palatable but I guess I will stick to straight black coffee from now on... my favourite being Illy Espresso.. yummy!

review/text: I have the good fortune to be married to a woman who graduated Summa from the Orlando Cordon Bleu Academy, and the food at our house is goooooood.<br /><br />The Mrs. and I are both coffee people and are familiar with French roasts and Hawaiian Kona.  We've had Cafe du Monde chicory coffee and I don't know how many others, including brews at restaurants run by Thomas Keller, Bobby Flay and Anthony Bourdain.  The point of this is we're familiar with coffee and know what we like.<br /><br />This is what we like.  Good old Folgers, and specifically French Vanilla (although I like Hazelnut about as well - the Mrs. completely prefers the French Vanilla.)<br /><br />Other coffees we find too harsh, or too bitter, or too froo-froo.  If you brew this (or the Hazelnut) at work people will migrate towards your coffee pot asking (begging?) for a cup.<br /><br />To be honest, I think we'd get this if all coffees cost the same.  Since this is less expensive than the "premium" blends, it's a good bargain as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I had researched my purchase before deciding to order from this vendor.  I ordered 20 stalks of "Lucky Bamboo" and plant food on Sunday evening.  When I checked my email on Monday morning, I had a message giving me the shipping status of my order as well as a very well written series of suggestions on how to plant and care for the plants.  The information matched every source I had previously read.<br /><br />The plants arrived on time.  They were packaged very well.  The plants are amazing.  They have great color, healthy leaves and very abundant roots.  Smelling of the stalks at the roots, there is a very earthy "green" smell, that I'd read is one of the best indicators of health.  The stalks are firm, and are all as long or longer than the inches promised in the ad.<br /><br />I WILL buy any other "Lucky Bamboo" from Kun in the future.

review/text: This item does not come with pots and no instructions. I wish 5 out of 6 photos didn't have a picture of a pot. It was not clearl whether it came with a pot or no, they tricked me. This was a gift too :-(. My son had no idea what to do with them when he got them, there were no instructions. He basically got 3 green sticks in a box...I'm not a happy camper :-(.

review/summary: Good and healthy bamboo
review/text: I didn't see the measurement in the description online, so when I received the package I was a little surprised that they seemed smaller than the pictures online (or my imagination).  But then I looked twice on the name, it mentioned "'mini' ceramic vases", it doesn't matter, the plants arrived in great shape, the roots were still a little wet so they wouldn't dry out during shipping.  The pots are cute.  The seller emailed me to instruct on how to maintain the plants.  I killed some plants before, but I also get to keep some alive.  I hope I can have these bamboo for a long time.  I recommand this seller.

review/summary: Great Customer Service
review/text: What a great experience!<br /><br />I originally ordered bamboo to use as part of a class<br />lesson for my son's elementary school.  I was looking for<br />pretty immediate delivery, so I asked for express.<br /><br />I soon got an email explaining that the bamboo on hand<br />was in a seasonal transition, and probably wouldn't be<br />of a quality that the seller wanted to provide.  I was<br />impressed with the early warning.<br /><br />As a result, I was able to make other arrangements for<br />lesson, and postpone the use of the bamboo.  The seller<br />was great at working with me around shipping schedule so<br />that I could be home to receive it.<br /><br />When it did arrive, it was carefully wrapped and in great<br />condition.  Very healthy plants perfect for use in the<br />first grade lesson.<br /><br />I really appreciated the level of communication, flexibility<br />and honesty in dealing with the seller.

review/summary: Newly Purchased, plant turned yellowish & died within 1 month.
review/text: Purchased new set of bamboo plants. Received good as was seen online. Daily used to water little so that the plant does not turn dry. Used to put only minimal water so that its not harmful for the plant. But within 1 month the plants turned yellowish and then dying.<br />I have taken well care of the plants before, but this was weird.

review/text: Packaged well. Healthy on arrival and have held up a month later. KL Design provided great support. Shipped quickly. Great communication and when they realized a mistake was made for the cost of shipping, KL corrected the issue before I even realized there was a mistake. I would definitely buy from them again.

review/summary: Yay! Lucky Bamboo!
review/text: This was my first time ever buying any sort of Lucky Bamboo, and I was really taken back back by how nice these stalks where! I have seen these before in varirous places, offices, homes, gift-shops. but these look much nicer then others I'v seen! On top of the bonus the seller gave me a free bottle of plant food! AND to top it even more, the seller was nice enough to contact me when shipping was delaided!

review/summary: Excellent service
review/text: I was worried about the condition these plants would be in when they arrived, but the shipping was fast, so it was not a problem.  I timed my order so they would arrive on a day I knew I would be home.  The plants were in great shape and I also received a bottle of plant food in the order.  Directions for care came in an email.  I would by from this seller again.

review/summary: Buyer beware: Small Garden Nursery
review/text: Buyers beware of the company Small Garden Nursery. They claimed to sell plants such as bamboo at a cheaper price. However, they don't fullfill the orders, and they don't answer emails. Usually, their mailbox is full. Do not waste your time and money.

review/summary: Seriously?
review/text: This may look like a less expensive alternative to Roundup Extended Control, but here's the real deal:<br /><br />Roundup Extended Control:<br /><br />One bottle of concentrate (1 qt) makes 5 gallons and covers 1,500 square feet.  It's advertised to prevent new growth for up to 4 months.  In my experience, this is more like 4-6 months, even on gravel covered ground during the AZ monsoon season.  Cost at the time of this writing = about $35 (but I've found it for less at a popular big box Home Outlet).<br /><br />Ortho Ground Clear:<br /><br />One bottle of the "concentrate" (1 qt) makes 1 gallon and covers only 75 square feet. It's advertised to prevent new growth for up to 1 year, but when you open up the label on the bottle you'll find this figure revised to 6-8 months for areas of "heavy rainfall."  Cost at the time of this writing = about $10.  If you want it to cover the same 1,500 square feet as $35 worth of Roundup Extended Control, you'll need to spend $200 on 20 bottles of Ortho Ground Clear.<br /><br />I think I'll stick with the Roundup.<br /><br />By the way, the instructions on the bottle of Ground Clear tell you to mix 1 quart into 1 gallon, but the bottle is only labeled in oz and mL.  Somebody in the label making department wasn't paying attention.

review/text: My first time trying a seasonal vegetation killer.  It does the job!<br /><br />Sprayed it a couple of months ago, and all the vegetation is still dead.  I even sprayed a brazilian pepper sapling that was about 4 feet tall poking through my deck, and it killed it within a couple of weeks, yikes!<br /><br />Update: the second order of this product was not nearly as effective as the first.  I'm not sure if it had sat on the shelf for too long before shipping or what.  I looked for an expiration date, but did not find one.  Dropping my rating to 3 stars.

review/summary: Mass Weedicide
review/text: I bought a gallon of this from the local home center about 3 months ago and covered about a third of my landscaping. After the wettest fall in local history, still no weeds.  I'm shopping Amazon this time for a (much) better price. If you want  to prevent weeds from growing up through your mulch, deck, or gravel, this is the stuff.

review/text: This works great to kill weeds and vegetation where you want to, like on your driveway, driveway seams, etc... just don't spray it in your yard... cause it kills everything.
