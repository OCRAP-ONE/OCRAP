review/summary: Awful
review/text: I guess I should have driven to Trader Joe's and purchased one bag only, as this item taste terrible.  This item on Amazon came in 6 pack only. Very strong taste and the Wasabi is quite hot. I watched Dr. Oz and that's what made me order it. I thought why not, a healthy snack and it appeared fairly good tasting on the show. Lesson learned, purchase in store if any doubt that a product may not taste good.

review/summary: Healthy, great taste, filling...and suitible for building a brick house.
review/text: After trying the Eat Think Smile cherry chocolate bars, which I really liked, I went right for these mixed berry ones, assuming they'd be about as good. Taste-wise, they are. The dark chocolate, oats and almonds are a great match, and the nutrition you get from a single bar isn't anything that's going to leave you feeling guilty. In fact, these are some of the healthier snack bars I've had over the last couple of years, with my main favorite being the various Odwalla ones. As if that weren't enough, the price for a pack of 6 of these isn't too bad.<br /><br />But...the problem is getting used to eating them. The first bite I took out of one of these bars, I had to really dig into it, almost the same way you do when taking a bite out of a big piece of jerky. The difference being that jerky isn't as thick as one of these, so the first bite is a real pain unless you keep these in a warm area, or even microwave them for a few seconds to soften them up. It's weird too because the box describes these as chewy, and that sure as heck isn't the case. After that first bite, you get used to the texture, and finishing the bar off isn't bad, but I wish they'd have made these softer. My only other complaint is that the berry taste is virtually non-existant, but that's not really a bad thing because of how great the dark chocolate/almonds taste is. Still, it'd be nice to get a little taste of berries in there.<br /><br />Since I got my order last tuesday, I'm down to my last two boxes. Obviously, the hardness isn't enough to keep me from annihilating these bars, and they're great for a pre-workout snack or something to have during a break at work. I'd recommend buying a single bar and trying it out before ordering the pack of six, or even one box. They might not be as healthy, but I think I'll stick with the chocolate cherry ones.

review/summary: Strange taste and undesirable consistency
review/text: I have enjoyed other Eat. Think. Smile. products but I can't recommend these granola bars. The fruit berries have a somewhat dirty taste and combined with their natural CocoaOne flavoring don't jive well.  The combination of the two just doesn't work.  The other problem is that these are crunchy but instead almost have a gummy consistency which just doesn't work in solid bar form.

review/summary: Flavored styrofoam
review/text: As one who enjoys various types of granola bars, I was looking forward to trying the EAT THINK SMILE all natural granola bars. At 160 calories, with only 35 calories from fat, these sounded like a great alternative to other higher fat items. After the first bite I was not impressed but I decided to finish the bar to give it a fair chance. The verdict.... it tasted like berry flavored styrofoam. A nice berry flavor was evident, but it was not sufficient to overcome the cardboard - styrofoam textured base.<br /><br />Aside from the displeasing texture, I found the box rather misleading in that it states "the natural antioxidant power of cocoa". I assumed from that statement that these bars were loaded with antioxidants, but the nutritional facts do not prove that true. Each granola bar has only 2% of vitamin C, 4% of vitamin E, and no vitamin A. Not an antioxidant packed product in my opinion.<br /><br />Try them and judge for yourself, but for me... I give them thumbs down.

review/summary: Very Promising, Sweet but Rather Dry
review/text: The Eat.Think.Smile 5 Mixed Berry Chewy Granola Bars are promising, but have one major flaw: they are rather dry. On the plus side, they are not as dry as their Rich Cocoa flavor <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BPVE5Y">Eat. Think. Smile. Chewy Granola Bars, Rich Cocoa, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> but still, they are more dry than one would expect from a granola bar of this kind. This one is saved by the fruit bits that give it some moisture (cherries and raspberry juice concentrate according to the ingredients list).<br /><br />Other than the dryness, this is a rather promising granola bar, promising the antioxidant equivalent of one cup of green tea thanks to its cocoa content. There are five bars in the nicely designed box, with each bar clocking in at 160 calories, 4g fat (0.5g saturated, 0g trans-fat), 0% cholesterol, 50mg sodium, 28g carbs (3g dietary fiber, 10g sugars), and 3g protein, with 10% magnesium, 8% iron, 4% Vitamin E and 2% Vitamin C.<br /><br />This is a sweet granola bar, so if you like the sweet taste it is a plus, if you don't, then you may not like it as much.<br /><br />If they fix the dryness in their recipe, this could get a lot better!

review/summary: Soy nuts are not organic, tastes slightly smoked
review/text: I reviewed the cocoa once as well, and if you want to try these kind of granola bars, I suggest you try the cocoa ones first, as they are slightly better than these ones.<br /><br />These are not too sweet, use more wholesome ingredients as a whole than regular granola bars, and could have been a good snack substitute for cookies or other more highly processed foods.<br /><br />However, they have an odd smoked flavor - something that might be ok with ham, but tastes weird in a granola bar. At least 2 people who tried them agreed with me - but not everyone did, so your mileage will vary here. What doesn't change though is the fact that they used regular soy beans here (one of the most genetically modified crops right now, and also has increasing amounts of pesticide). Given the widespread availability of organic soybeans, and the fact that these are actually not expensive (*yet*) this seems like a big oversight.<br /><br />Note: I don't eat all organic, I eat a bit of everything, from stuffed crust pizza hut to organic tempeh. But I try to eat a few organic things, and soy based products are one of those. Specially since there isn't much difference in price between organic and non-organic soy products. (as opposed to say, organic tomatoes vs traditional, which cost 3 times more)<br /><br />Note: These are still a healthier alternative than high fructose corn syrup filled granola bars, filled with highly processed ingredients. This uses brown rice, whole oats, etc. So if your kid really likes granola bars, maybe you could try these instead of the regular ones they are eating. (but I'd take a look at others and compare prices with some organic alternatives, since these aren't cheap either)

review/summary: Adequate snack, not chewy - on the dry side.Mild flavor.
review/text: These bars are a middle of the road snack item that travels well, is filling, has somewhat healthy ingredients, so-so flavor, and a dense, dry, crumbly texture. The 4 gr of fat per bar is only .5 gr of saturated fat which we do watch in our household so the low saturated fat is a bonus. I didn't feel the taste was really berryish, you could kind of taste a bit of the cocoa and it was sweet but nothing jumped out as being a berry flavor. I liked the slivers of almonds and pieces of fruit incorporated into the bar breaking up the solid consistency of it somewhat and giving a better twist on the flavor when you ran into them.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd buy these again, but I wouldn't turn one down if it was offered to me and I was hungry. I wouldn't go out of my way to get one, I'd probably buy something with a bit more flavor to it. It's nice that there are antioxidants in the cocoa but I'd probably just drink a cup of green tea and ingest less calories.

review/text: These are great bars - they have a wonderful light and airy consistency with a bit of crunch. They are not too filling though do satisfy my hunger in a pinch. They are nutritious and actually make me feel better after eating them, unlike many other meal replacement bars. They are not too sweet by any means, so do know you are getting a subtle flavor here. That's what I like about them. I have a box of chocolate ones and these berry ones and do find myself reaching for the chocolate ones more often! The berry flavor is subtly sweet and refreshing and definitely a good choice too. Not a big berry flavor, just a hint of it. Definitely worth buying.

If they found a way to make the bars chewy then these would be AWESOME.  Until then I will have to give this review three stars.  I really wanted to give it five but the bars are not "chewy" as advertised.

review/text: The Mixed Berry Chewy Granola Bars from Eat. Think. Smile. are really a mixed bag that could have been a lot better.  Like other products from this brand their keystone ingredient is unprocessed cocoa.  With chocolate, berries, and nuts, you really have the makings of a great, healthy granola bar for snacks or breakfast.  So what's the catch?  The base of the granola bar is a lot like Styrofoam.  While they aren't so bad that I won't eat them, I don't think I'll purchase them in the future.  It's a shame because I really liked the idea.  However I would advise people to check out the offerings from Kashi instead.  They have a variety of good flavors with a much better texture.

review/summary: Like Chocolate-covered Cherries
review/text: These bars are not exactly "mixed berry." I was expecting berries, but could not quite identify the flavor when I tasted the first bar. I noticed that the bars are crunchy, not too sweet, and have a chocolate flavor.<br /><br />After, getting over my surprise at the taste, I read the list of ingredients. The "berry' flavor is actually cherry. Also, there is cocoa in the bars. The sugar content is low, about one-quarter. Many granola bars are one-third or more sugar, which makes them softer and sweeter.<br /><br />I have come to like these bars. The taste reminds me of chocolate-covered cherries. This product is not for those who have a sweet tooth. However, I prefer the low sugar content. They make a good afternoon snack. The price is good, just over twenty dollars for six packages of five bars, or thirty bars.

review/text: I begin this review by saying that these bars are quite tasty.  The berry flavor comes through cleanly, and they are not cloyingly sweet; it has the flavor that reminds me of a chocolate-covered cherry.  Unfortunately, for all the wonderful natural flavor, the texture leaves a bit to be desired.<br /><br />This reminded me more of a crunchy granola bar that didn't fully "crunch-i-fy" vs. an actual chewy granola bar.  You are left with something of moisture-sucking dryness, but without the crunchy satisfaction of a crunchy granola bar.

review/text: I like chewy granola bars.  In fact, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZIE">Cascadian Farm Organic Chewy Granola Bar</a> are the best I've had in terms of flavor and texture.  Next up, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LTM29M">Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars</a> have a great flavor, but they're crunchy.  Good, but crunchy.<br /><br />These "Eat.  Think.  Smile." granola bars, texture-wise, could be considered the unfortunate offspring of the above chewy and crunchy goodness.  Mine were "mostly crunchy" (but not dry like those that are advertised as crunchy) but when a small enough piece was in my mouth, it softened up enough to not be crunch.  If you take the entire bar and fold it in half, it will break, not bend.<br /><br />So, kill one star for the "Chewy" not living up to its name here.<br /><br />And the other star goes away for a variety of reasons:  "mixed berry" is misleading, unless you consider juice a berry.  The only actual berry in here is cherry, and while it does provide a burst of sweetness, it doesn't taste much like a cherry.  And the cocoa powder they use seems to be more for health benefits (anti-oxidants) and coloring than for flavor, because these neither smell like nor taste any like cocoa/chocolate.<br /><br />All in all, I wouldn't really recommend these unless you're don't mind the texture, and can tolerate a granola bar not tasting like granola, chocolate or "berries" (cherries) that they're advertised as.

review/summary: Typical Healthy Granola Bar
review/text: I eat a lot granola bars as a snack or part of my lunch. Some like Nature Valley have so much sugar to approach being a candy bar minus the chocolate coating. I avoid high fructose corn syrup and try to eat as much whole wheat products as possible, which typically means buying granola bars from companies like Kashi. This means I don't expect my granola bar to taste like a Snicker's bar. With that in mind, I found these Mix Berry bars to taste like mildly sweet dried fruit, with reminded me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072MWJ80">Kashi TLC Chewy Granola Bars Cherry Dark Chocolate 6 - 1.2 Oz (35g) Bars (Pack of 6)</a> but with minimal chocolate taste.

review/summary: A healthy snack, just don't think of it as "granola"
review/text: This unique snack bar doesn't taste at all like a traditional granola bar, with an unusual chew, distinct cocoa flavors, and a berry sweetness.<br /><br />I enjoy these unusual bars, which eat more "slowly" than regular granola for me (a positive since I like to snack).  Almonds and cherries punch up the flavor and add to the list of healthy ingredients, also making this into more of a "premium" granola bar.  While I enjoyed, the girlfriend didn't care for these bars, although she commented on the fruity smell and thought that they'd appeal to people who like dark chocolate (turns out, I like dark chocolate).<br /><br />The eye-catching packaging is attractively designed and the easy-open wrapper don't hurt.  Somebody has put serious thought into making these granola bars as aesthetically pleasing as possible.  Considering that, it's a little odd they don't feature organic or fair-trade ingredients, either of which would surely appeal to the target demographic (including me).<br /><br />My favorite granola bars remain the Cascadian Farm Organic Mixed Nut which have a appealing blend of texture with organic chocolate and nuts.  But these EatThinkSmile bars are nice variety if you like the flavor of dark chocolate.  Recommended.

review/text: The description of these bars made me think they'd be sweeter and more treat-like. In reality, they have a natural sweetness from the dried cherries, but are not sugary tasting at all. I do enjoy the combination of chewy crunch, with enough nuts added to keep my mouth busy for awhile.<br /><br />Although they don't have enough substance to replace breakfast for me like some protein bars will, they are a very good afternoon "pick me up" that satisfies some cravings without giving me a sugar high.<br /><br />The cocoa powder is not very noticeable at all in the flavor, it's more of a hint or even an aftertaste. If you are looking for something that will be a healthier replacement for a candy bar, I don't think these will satisfy that craving. But as a slightly sweet and nutty snack, they're very good.

review/text: I keep a few of these at the office for a nice break. The cherry and cocoa mix is a bit of a surprise. Based on the label, I was expecting more of a mixed berry flavor but it turns out the only fruit component is dried cherries which is slightly tart. The cocoa flavor is light and not as sweet as chocolate chips. But the great thing about this mix is that the bar ends up being a nice balance of the tart and sweet. The almond and oats add a nice chewy/nutty texture. All in all, I really like it. For less than $4 for 5 bars, it's not a bad deal. But, I'd probably wait for bigger discounts with a Subscribe & Save option.

I would prefer if they were a little less sweet, and looking at the ingredients you can see there is some added sugar for a total of 10grams per bar.  Not overly high, but I would have liked it to be around 6grams of sugar per bar.  The bars are not overly chewy, which is a good thing, so you don't need to worry about any dental work - they taste more like a soft oatmeal cookie with a bit of bite.

review/summary: Stale
review/text: Although the expiration date on the bars I got is still 8 months away, the bars are stale. The flavor seems okay (at first), but it also makes it clear that there are no berries in this product. The only fruits in the ingredient list are cherries, and raspberry *juice*. It also leaves a bitter after-taste in my mouth.<br /><br />I was hoping for better, but I was very disappointed.

review/text: Though they've messed with the formula a few times, I think it's back, or at least close to the original they used around 5 years ago. I love this stuff though (with a little clove added) and go through a can every few days, year round now.<br /><br />I do have to say this price is completely ridiculous. It's around $3.30 a can in my local supermarket. They also often have a special that gives you around $1 off per can (For example "buy 4 or more, get a $4 off coupon for next store visit".)

review/text: Bigelow's Chamomile Mint is a great relaxing tea to drink throughout the day. I usually use the teabag twice to fill up my 20oz mug and it brews as strong as the first time. I love chamomile and mint tea by themselves, but Bigelow combines the two really well. I've noticed that the mint is not very strong, but it leaves a pleasantly light tingling feeling while the chamomile is a lot stronger. I will definitely purchase this again!

review/summary: My favorite tea!
review/text: I got addicted to this tea when I went to visit some friends in England. I had never enjoyed unflavored tea with milk before, but my friends drank this all the time and I started drinking it as well. By the time I came back home, I brought some with me, I was hooked!<br /><br />When I saw my stock getting close to empty, I was pleased to see the grocery stores here sold Tetley. But unless it's imported, the tea is really not the same. I bought a box of the stuff they sell here in the US with 100 tea bags and it's still sitting on the shelf with 99 bags in it, it's not the same thing. So I logged on and was glad to find it here on Amazon. Because free shipping doesn't apply to this product and it's a bit high, I went ahead and purchased enough to last me for a few months.<br /><br />I really love this tea and there's nothing like it with a splash of milk and a couple of sugars! I have to say I could never understand why the British drink so much tea, but after trying this brand, I can tell the stuff they drink there is nothing like what we get over here.<br /><br />For your reference, Tetley is a milder tea. If you like the more bitter stuff, like PG Tips, you probably won't enjoy it as much. In my opinion, Tetley with milk has a creamier flavor. I don't really like PG Tips because I find it too harsh or bitter. So, if you're like me, Tetley will probably be more to your taste.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Absolutely delicious
review/text: The title says it all, really. I love violet and this was a good way to get my fix. The sweetness didn't overpower that delicate floral flavor I was craving. The orange is not your typical variety of orange candy, so if you want a flavor like Jolly Ranchers or similar, look elsewhere. It's a deliciously subtle taste that makes me want to savor it. I can't give a personal review of the anise as I dislike anise candy, but my husband liked them and he's... particular about candy, shall we say.<br /><br />The tins got here without any broken candy or dents in the tins. The tins, by the way, are very pretty and are good for pill cases and organizing tiny odds and ends. They withstood hot glue without warping. That last one probably isn't the biggest selling point, but hey, I can't be the only crafter that will order these!<br /><br />All in all, wonderful candy and I will buy these again.

Keep in mind that each bag can be used two or three times (using a 12 oz cup), so it's more like the box makes 30 cups, not 15 -- which definitely makes the steep price a lot more bearable!<br /><br />UPDATE TO REVIEW: they seem to have changed their bags -- putting less tea in, so I no longer feel that it is worth the purchase as the bags no longer bear repeated steeping very well.

review/text: The packaging of this product makes me sad. If you are going to buy jasmine pearls, buy them loose. Part of the fun of the jasmine pearls is the touch of pearls themselves, and watching them unravel in the tea cup or pot. You also want to give the tea lots of space to unravel. Teabags are for small loose leaf and spice fragments. These are beautiful hand-rolled tea leaves that shouldn't be trapped in a bag, even a trendy pyramid bag.

The introduction of the larger package, with a major cost per ounce reduction built in, is a double whammy in a good way.  So, I'm a subscriber as well because a few of these on hand is a no-brainer.

review/summary: Awesome sampler tea set!
review/text: I wasn't sure exactly what to expect after purchasing, but the product definitely exceeded the expectations I had. As I was out of town when I ordered the product, I didn't expect to receive the tea set until after I came home.  In actuality, the package arrived much faster and was already delivered before I came home.  Definitely a plus!<br />  After opening the box, I found three sets of teas inside.  Each pack of tea was properly labeled with a tea I had never tried before(Strawberry Kiwi Fruit Tisane, Rooibos Capetown, and Sencha Cherry Rose).<br />  After spending time trying each tea, I can really say this is an awesome tea set.  The teas complement each other very well, each having their own distinct aromas.  The Rooibos(my favorite) in particular seemed to have a number of different flavors within each taste.  An example of this would the hints of lemon you could taste right at the very end(sooooo good!)<br />  The amount of tea was really great as well.  Although it says "sampler set", they really gave you a lot to try and was very happy with the amount in each tin.<br />  Overall, an excellent buy for any tea lover and if a tea novice(like myself) a great introduction into new and great tasting teas.

review/summary: Enfamil better than Similac
review/text: our baby was formula fed due to lack of breast milk production. Plus, there has been atlest 2 generations of children who were formula fed and are now gorwn up, proving that formula fed babies grow up same as those who are breat fed. PLs Don't hold me to that statement, If you can produce breast milk and have the  time, patience and strength to breast feed, I would much rather that my baby gets the natural breast milk than formula.<br /><br />Our baby started with Similac, which was given to us at the hospital, within a week, she was having gas and tummy issues, the pediatrician advised us to get the Similac sensitive, it seemed to work for a week, but then the tummy issues were back, she was having trouble passing gas and having BM's. we tried gas medicines such as mylicon and gripe water, but those were helpful only for a few hours. Then our friend recomended Enfamil gentlease. although it was a little more epxpensive ( a few cents here and there), we tried it, and now our baby is almost 3 moths with no problems in terms of gas or tummy issues. Its a huge help, and I would completely recomend it. I would also say it will depend from baby to baby.<br /><br />We did have a few days ( 2-3 days) of trouble when we switched to the different formulas, but that is the transition period. It does not work overnight, but when it does, its a big relief.

None of them taste good, but this is one is really awful!<br /><br />Maybe he was so used to the regular Enfamil that he wouldn't take it no matter how it tastes but the fact is I was totally disappointed with this product.<br /><br />By the way, since he refused to take it, we simply don't know if it would help him or not with gases.

review/text: While I dearly love the Cadbury bars from England, I did not have much success with enjoying them, even though they were shipped to me twice.  Shipping candy in the summer months or anywhere where it is hot is difficult.  My first shipment took 10 days and arrived a melted mess in the box.  The second shipment was sent 2 day delivery, arrived 5 days after my order, but was in better shape.  Melted soft but still intact.  In future, I will order these in the colder months and always request 2 day delivery.  Perhaps ordering on Monday will ensure no layover on the weekend.  Amazon did a fine job of packaging, even included a small freezer pad in the container.

review/summary: Favorite chocolates in the world, but hazardous shipping when the temps are high
review/text: It's very difficult to find UK Cadbury in my area of Florida.  I had no problems when ordering these chocolates during the winter months, but once the temperatures hit the 80s, they did not arrive without being semi or completely melted.  I did pay for overnight shipping and Amazon packed them with two freezer packs, but they shipped from Texas to Florida overnight and the UPS truck has no air conditioning.  It was placed on the area truck early this morning (7AM) and didn't arrive to me until 3PM.  Several hours in the heat managed to completely melt the two freezer ice packages.  They were nothing but liquid.  Most of the chocolates seem to be intact, with only some melting around the edges.  One bar is completely turned into an almost pretzel shape as it fell to the side of the others in the box.  It is only 85 degrees here today, so I know things will be much worse once summer hits.  I will have to wait to order these again when November or December arrives to bring cooler temperatures.<br /><br />This is my favorite chocolate and deserves my highest rating.  If you live in Florida or another hot climate, be warned that even one day shipping and the careful packaging by Amazon will not help these chocolates survive.

(Lindt changed their receipe, so now we can't eat it)<br /><br />I don't feel drained and grouchy after eating it - and my kid does not get spazy, weird, belligerent after eating this!!<br /><br />We thought it was the sugar that made him react, but after oodles of research, we found out that the lecithin was the primary triger.<br /><br />Hope this review helps others!<br /><br />PLUS it tastes divine, like it should  :)

review/text: This is much better then the US version of KitKat. However is it worth the price? as a novelty or a gift to a huge KitKat lover which is what I got it for then yes. For a regualr person just wanting a good candy bar, NO! it is not so much better as to be worth the price. If the two were sitting side by side for the same amount I would pick this one every time though.

review/summary: Vanilla wafers -- beware they can melt in shipment!!!
review/text: These tasty chocolate coated wafers are a great way to get a chocolate fix without too many calories. Be warned however that if the weather is sunny and in the 70's or higher, you're likely to be disappointed when you open the box because the chocolate melts. You'll have three solid blocks instead of 18 wafers, even if you used next day delivery. Best to order this product when cloudy weather is forecast, and high temps will be in the 60's or less -- apparently those brown UPS trucks get pretty warm in the sun!

If they could be put on ice packs for shipment, they would get to the customer in much better shape.

Of all the brands and types of cookies, these are her favorite.  I have tried one as well and as far as prepackaged, store bought cookies are concerned, these are great.  The cookie is made up of alternating layers of waffers and chocolate creme and the whole cookie has been dipped in chocolate.  If you like chocolate I think you are going to love these cookies.

review/text: Before becoming a Celiac and switching to a gluten free diet, I used to love Trader Joe's Vanilla Joe Joe's. I found these on sale at the Grocery Outlet the other day and decided to give these a try. These were so much better than the Trader Joe's Vanilla Joe Joe's and significantly better than Vanilla Oreo's. Even my gluten eating friends said they were addicting. They are great dipped in hot chocolate, milk or tea but are even better on their own. Will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Great Cookies -- Period
review/text: I've purchased most of the gluten free cookies available on Amazon and in local stores.  These are best of the bunch.  If you like wafer cookies -- they're good whether you can eat gluten or not (I grew up eating cookies with wheat and these compete with any "normal" wafer cookie (I wouldn't go as far as I would with Blue Diamond's Nut-Thin crackers, which I would say are better than regular crackers -- but they are at least as good as most cookies -- if you serve them to friends they won't wince (or even know they are eating gluten free) when they bite into them).  The other Glutino flavors aren't bad either but the chocolate is the best -- I find chocolate tends to help mask the glutin free flour taste in most cookies.<br /><br />I would recommend some caution in shipping them during the summer as you are more likely to recieve a cookie block rather than individual wafers (although the cookie block was pretty tasty too).  Also, an added bonus for anyone shipping to APO or DPO, they will ship to these addresses(again a caution about the heat, especially if you are shipping to Afghanistan during the summer).

I generally order Schar products and love their vanilla sandwich creams which really are as good as or better than gluten cookies.  With Glutino I feel it's hit and miss.  Their crackers are generally delicious and I love their pretzels but these cookies tasted like styrofoam and the icing was super sweet.  Not my favorite product from Glutino.  If you didn't care for these, you might try the Schar vanilla cremes.  They're amazing!

review/summary: Very close to Nabisco Sugar Wafers taste
review/text: The wafer part tastes very close to Nabisco sugar wafers but it's so much lighter. The light, crispy wafer combined with the strawberry flavor is not too sweet, like most GF products are, it's just right. We love them.

review/summary: Sweet and refreshing
review/text: I love these! After discovering a familial gluten intolerance, premade items that are gluten free have been difficult to obtain. Therefore, I now order these by the case each month. Light, refreshing, sweet and no grainy aftertaste. Yahoo! I don't have to break my dient now and I might not starve to death! I am so weary of lettuce....
