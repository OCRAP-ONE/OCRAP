review/summary: Good taste, helps with Lipomas
review/text: Why do I order this?<br />-I order this tea specifically because it helps with my benign fatty tumors just beneath the skin (lipomas).<br />-Most are not noticeable, but a few are 1/2" to 1" in diameter just under the skin, usually in forearms or thighs (google 'lipoma', and you'll see a LOT more details).<br />-I had been doing a LOT of research and found Dandelion root tea 'might' help.<br />-As an alternative to out-patient surgery, I thought I'd try it.<br /><br />Taste/Flavor:<br />-The taste is good (although some non-tea-drinking family members don't care for it).<br />-I can steep it as long as I want in hot water and it doesn't get bitter (unlike some green teas)<br /><br />Dosage:<br />-After using this tea for ~3 months, it seems evident it helps prevent growth or actually reduces the size of lipomas with no other change in diet.<br />-I find that I need to take at LEAST 2-3 cups per day to keep the lipomas from growing.<br /><br />Reasoning/Background:<br />-I'm not sure how it works, but it does (at least for me).<br />-I read that dandelion root tea helps your body digest fat better (which is what lipomas are made from).<br />-Maybe it's because the tea is supposed to stimulate bile production.<br />-The manufacturer recommends to take a 'break' from the tea after ~6 weeks, but I haven't found out WHY (even my doctor isn't sure why they would say this).<br /><br />Overall:<br />-Would I drink this tea if I didn't have lipomas? probably not, there's no need that I can see.<br />-Is it worth it? for me, YES. It's a non-surgical, non-prescription way to manage my lipomas.<br />-I order about 1 box every month on the 'subscription' from Amazon to get it even cheaper.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I'm a tea drinker (can't stand coffee), so I was unsure about trying this tea after seeing the reviews about how well it replaces coffee.  It doesn't taste like any of my favorite teas.  Fortunately, it doesn't taste like coffee either.  It's really different and I really like it.  I don't know whether or not it's making my liver and kidneys happy, but it's good enough to drink on a regular basis.  Two thumbs up.

review/summary: Good, but be careful.
review/text: I love this tea and it's really healthy. That being said, I've drank a lot of it the past several months and I'm having some issues which are at least partially my fault. It says clearly on the package to take a break of two weeks or so after drinking the tea for four consecutive weeks. I was conscious of this and took some breaks, but maybe not often enough and for long enough periods of time. I've developed an ulcer, not solely through drinking a lot of this tea, but it did contribute. I just did a bunch of reading on the internet and it says that dandelion tea increases stomach acid. After experimenting with a two-week break recently, I can DEFINITELY confirm my suspicion that the tea makes the pain worse. So, all in all, this is good tea for a good price, but please do your research and be careful when using it.

review/summary: Great taste + great health~
review/text: Tried my first cup today and would like to point out what is noted on the package: Dandelion teas should be used for periods of up to 4-6 weeks, followed by a break before resuming.<br /><br />I urge anyone considering Dandelion tea to do their own research. It's easy to do and you can make your own informaed decision. I will say Dandelion tea has excellent health benefits and good for many ailments. I am not a physician so can only speak for myself. I started drinking a high quality loose dandelion which was very tasty and provided the benefits it claimed. All that aside, secondarily I would like to take a break from coffee and as a java junkie I was pleasantly surprised by my first cup today. I take low fat low sugar in my strong dark roast but this only needs a packet of stevia and no cream. It tastes like a weak coffee. It also smells like coffee! This may well help me take a real break from coffee. With all its health benefits it's worth learning to love this for anyone needing it for good health. Enjoy~<br /><br />Update: I've been drinking this tea 3x day and I absolutely love it. I am  a big coffee drinker even though I only drink coffee before 11am.  I've tried the other brand of roasted dandelion and there is no comparison. This brand is the tastiest and I love the smokey flavor. If you have HBP that has no relatable cause and is being managed by a prescription diuretic, ask your doc if you can try this for 2-3 weeks. I refused a prescription and tried this and it works amazingly well for me. Has several amazing health benefits so a real no-brainer for me and a fortunate find.

review/summary: roasted dandelion root tea
review/text: I was looking for tea to get me off of my highly caffeinated ones.  I saw this on sale at a decent price at my local grocery and decided to give it a whirl it was so cheap.  I really liked it.  I don't have any liver problems but I'm sure my liver could use a good cleaning.  My health conscious friend kept telling me I need to eat foods or do a cleanse that releases the bile of the liver so I don't get a liver stone build-up.  I told him I was drinking this tea and he said it's a start.  I did the subscribe 'n' save to save a little on the bulk teas.  Also the directions on the box say to use it for 4 - 6 weeks and you can't do that drinking it 3 times a day with just one box.  Amazon has a good deal here.

review/summary: Taste really does grow on you
review/text: In researching dandelion root, I came across a lot of different, sometimes contradictory claims, none of which seem to be backed up by any serious research. I believe it does have a diuretic and possibly laxative effect, and it is supposedly good for the liver. Again, those claims may be dubious, but I could see this as a good coffee substitute if you had to cut down for some reason (caffeine, acid). It tasted terrible to me at first, but after about 4 cups I really started to like it. I brew it with two teabags and steep for 15 minutes. Now it basically tastes like coffee to me (note that I'm more of a tea drinker, however).

review/text: I understand this has many, many health benefits. However, I really dislike the true dandelion taste it has. I would like to continue it for the health benefits, but I need to find something to add to cut that bitter dandelion taste. I drink a lot of different herbal and flavoured teas, but this is not something I could drink on a regular basis. I find it very unpleasant tasting. We all taste things differently, and this taste is not for me.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

No JUNK in the ingredients list: Whole Oat Flour, Yellow Corn Flour, Unsulphured Molasses, Whole Wheat Flour, Salt, Baking Soda, Natural Vitamin E, Vitamin C.<br /><br />Has a light oat taste that reminds me of Life cereal but much less sweet. This is just sweet enough not to be bland - only 5g of sugar per serving. I start with just a little in a bowl with soy milk and add a little more cereal if needed so it doesn't get soggy.<br /><br />This is cereal is also good for snacking; I often pack a small zip lock bag to carry in my purse when I am out and about or traveling. Good mixed in with my homemade trail mix too!<br /><br />Highly recommended!

So if you don't like soggy cereal you would not want to get this. However, it can also be a great non-milk snack.

It has the nutrition of whole wheat with the consistency of white flour--so it's not too heavy and gritty. I make gravies, soups, muffins, pancakes, cookies etc.--everything with it. I'll never buy white non-nutritious flour again! It's a great way to sneak whole grains into desserts. I never feel guilty cooking with this as I know it's healthy for my family and provides necessary whole grains. It has the whole grain yellow stamp on it, which my son says means it's good for you. I love cooking with this flour and use it all the time.

review/summary: Not if you've had the regular version, otherwise okay
review/text: I'm a huge Stephen's fan but I'd only ever had the regular Milk Choc hot cocoa.  Deciding to be a little more health conscious I thought I'd try the fat-free variety.  DON'T! :)  Okay, if you aren't expecting it to be like the regular version then go for it.  It's much better than other fat-free hot cocoa varieties but doesn't do justice to regular Stephen's Hot Cocoa.  I'm going back to the good stuff.

review/summary: Very good hot Cocoa
review/text: I ordered this as the price was certainly right (6 1lb cans for less than $30) and the reviews were good.<br /><br />This is certainly a step up in the hot cocoa market. Better than just about anything you can find in the supermarket. I certainly prefer hot chocolate - but it can be time-consuming to make and it's tough to heat milk and melt chocolate at work or in class.<br /><br />This is the perfect compromise for when you want that chocolate drink and aren't in a position to 'do it right'.<br /><br />Very good taste and dissolves well. I always use a little more than it says on the can - with some cocoa that means it won't all dissolve - this is not a problem here.<br /><br />Certainly recommended.

review/text: I purchased this product as a gift for my mom who simply loves this cocoa.  When the local supermarket where she purchased the cocoa stopped stocking it she figured that was the end of it.  Ha!  Little did she know that I would find a way to track it down on line.  And on Amazon!  She was surprised and pleased.  The price is good, as is the cocoa.  I would only be more happy if I could get an assortment.

review/summary: Incredible Hot Chocolate with Raspberry
review/text: I ran into this product at a bed and breakfast.  Unlike most hot chocolate mixes with another flavor component, the raspberry flavor in this is an equal partner with the chocolate.  You don't get just a hint of it that soon gets lost.  You taste the raspberry with the first sip and the last sip....very very enjoyable.  Highly recommend.

review/text: This is absolutely delicious.  Because it is in powder form, you can make it as strong or weak as your taste buds allow.  I add instant Folger's to mine, making it into a mocha.  That also cuts the sweetness.  It really DOES taste like chocolate covered cherries -- a treat I have loved since childhood!<br /><br />I get mine through the "subscription program" along with several other flavors from Stephen's.  The subscription program works well for me since I travel. You can change the frequency AND the address to which it is to be sent as needed.

review/summary: Stephen's Hot Candycane Cocoa is the best!
review/text: We have been drinking Stephen's Candycane Cocoa for several years.  Our Walmart carries it at Christmas time, but they run out fast.  It's the candycane pieces in the cocoa that make it soo good!  You can make it as strong or weak as you like it, by adding more cocoa or more water than the directions say.  I like it a little stronger - it gives it a bold chocolate taste with a strong candycane kick!  I don't know what else to tell you except it is absolutely out of this world!  All you need is a cup, a spoon, hot water, and Stephen's Candycane Cocoa.  You're set, drink up!  Just remember not to use it all up in one setting!<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing I would change about this product is the number of cups of cocoa per can.  It calls for 3 1/2 rounded tablespoons of cocoa mix per 6 ounces of hot water.  When Sara and I make a 12 oz cup each and each have a refill, we can almost kill off one can in a sitting.  (Yes, it IS that good!)  I wish Stephen's could concentrate this or put it up in larger cans.<br /><br />I hope I have helped in your purchasing decision.

review/text: Well, I love hot cocoa but this is truly different. It literally has bits of candy cane mixed into the cocoa mix and it is a refreshing "warm you from the inside out" hot cocoa drink. If you are someone that isn't sold on peppermint in your hot cocoa you just have to try it. The peppermint is very subtle but very pleasing to the palate. Truly different from any hot cocoa that I have ever enjoyed.

review/text: I originally received this Mint Truffle hot chocolate as a gift, and was a little bit dismayed that the instructions say to mix it with water, because in the past that always results in a weak flavor. Amazingly, that is not the case with this mix, even with no milk added this has a great rich, chocolate-mint taste.<br /><br />Because it doesn't require milk, I can keep it at work for a warm-up drink on cold office days. I usually put 4 teaspoons of mix in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P6855Y">Aladdin 16-Ounce Recycled and Recyclable Tumbler, Lily</a> then add hot water from the dispenser at work for a perfect mug of hot chocolate.

review/text: I bought this hot chocolate at a grocery store because it looked interesting.  We like to drive around our neighborhood and look at the Christmas lights.  I always like to drink hot chocolate while enjoying this outing.  Oh My Gosh!  This hot chocolate was incredible. When I opened the can to make it, I saw pieces of Candycane candy in the chocolate powder. I made it the way that they suggested, with hot water, not milk.  It was so creamy with just the right amount of peppermint flavor.  There were no lumps and it was excellent to the last drop.  I am thrilled to see that they carry this on Amazon because I know that the grocery store only carried it for the holidays and the price on Amazon is much less than I paid.

review/text: These folks are right.  This stuff is very rich and we just use skim milk.  Richer than the expensive chocolate shavings we have splurged on in the past.  The tins go along ways too.  The per serving cost is a fraction of buying the individual packets at the grocery store of other brands, but I would pay more anyway because this stuff is so good.  We just had to order another case.  Try it with some coffee.  Mash it up in some vanilla ice cream. Seems like they could sell it for much more if they got rid of the dude's first name.  First name only brands really cheese up the product.  How about "Cocoa Passions" or "Divine Cocoa" or even, "Serenity Now Cocoa".  Anything would Glam up the product name a little. I am a builder, would you buy an expensive house from "Kreg's Stately Mansions"? Nope.  Doesn't matter how choice the work is. I am sorry, Stephen, you do have a great product, I'll stop. Oh well, keep the prices low...Five stars, brother.

review/text: I really enjoyed this, and will probably be purchasing other flavors as well (if they are re-stocked - it seems that most of them are sold out).  I wanted something a little better than what I find in my area grocery stores, and this was really good.  The first time we made it, it was with milk, and it was a little too rich for me (which I thought was impressive, especially as I was only using skim milk), so I've since moved to a combination of milk and water, and it tastes GREAT (and I'll probably still make it with just milk, after adjusting more towards that over time).  My house is known for hot cocoa (we have at least 7 options right now), but everybody who has had this has enjoyed it.

Most of it dissolves in the liquid.<br /><br />I mix my cocoa with a battery operated frother, which uses every single bit of cocoa, so there is not a single bit of cocoa on the bottom.<br /><br />After, it's really a pepperminty cup of chocolate that is very lovely. Refreshing, I'd say.<br /><br />This is a must with milk, though I think you can do it with water... but milk is best to get the full flavor effect.

review/summary: Stephens Gourmet NSA Hot Chocolate
review/text: If you've read the other reviews about Stephens hot chocolate, well, the same for this one. It tastes rich and good. I'm diabetic type II and there is nothing else in hot chocolate that comes close without being loaded with sugar. Diabetes really narrows the field when it comes to things you can eat or drink so am glad that Stephens makes this product. In every shiny white cloud there is a bit of soot hiding somewhere. The lump of coal is that they don't sell it in Canada and won't ship across the border. That is so sad. Canadians having to deal with yet another item they can't get. Not sure why this is whether US government, Canadian border guards with a grudge, or Stephens just don't want extra paper work. Thank goodness for friends who go on trips down south and bring it back for me. Good stuff.

review/summary: Yummy and warm in my tummy!!!
review/text: Make per directions and use half & half to top off for richer taste, maybe a little whipped cream topper and you have have a melt in the chair, soft spot, where visions of sugar plums and the like may begin to dance in your heads.  Yummy and so delicious.  I've purchased twice, first at near $13-each for two, then near $5-each for six of them - chalk it up to when you're buying!  I should make clear that I do not regret my initial purchase, I was merely showing an example when timing can play a part in the value of this kind of transaction.  Please allow me to elaborate that I initially selected Chadwell Retail sellers as I was trying the product, and it seemed reasonable given the value for two to select them to complete my purchase.  I have no qualms with the seller and would openly consider their services on this open market again as the purchase made sense.  Thank you for reading this far and for your consideration in advance.

review/summary: Soooo good!!!  Perfect!!!
review/text: I also tried the Cherry Chocolate and Peanut Butter Cup flavors and they are amazing!  So thick and creamy, especially if you make it with a little milk!  What I really like is that they aren't overly sweet, and that it mixed together very well, unlike most brands that just clump up and stick to the spoon.  Definitely my favorite hot chocolate!  The cider flavors are great too!

review/summary: Stephens Hot Hazelnut Hot Chocolate
review/text: This is simply the best hot chocolate mix I have ever used.  The flavor is wonderful, whether you like hazelnut or not (the hazelnut flavor is subtle.) It tastes like you made it from scratch rather than a mix.  It's difficult to find, so locating it on Amazon was a great find.

review/summary: Not exactly sure how to rate this
review/text: I bought this mostly based on the reviews. I really wanted hot chocolate from Stephen's, but amazon didn't have it. I stumbled across this and thought I would try it. It is white, even though "cocoa" is in the title...in case you didn't figure that out! I did realize it wasn't chocolate, but didn't really know what to expect.<br /><br />The best way I can describe it is that it tastes like a vanilla milkshake, but hot! I happen to love vanilla milkshakes way more than chocolate ones (but hate drinking milk, go figure), but somehow, I haven gotten used to this product after about a week. I have 6 cans now, so I have many more opportunities to try! It may just be that I sort of mentally "expect" hot chocolate and I have to retrain my slow brain! It is interesting and different, and I still drink it, and almost like it, but still would pick pick the hot chocolate over this. Definitely worth a try if you like vanilla.

review/summary: The richest tasting hot cocoa I've ever tasted.
review/text: I bought a can of Stephen's hot cocoa over 5 years ago not realizing how good it was going to be. After I drank the first few cups I was hooked and could not find it anywhere again. I ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the UK with me when we moved over taking care to make them last. I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way. If you'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. You really don't need marshmallows.

Now everyone I know buys it and I'm even happier to be spreading it around. My only issue is that I wish they would have a mixed pack; a 6 pack of mint, hazelnut, regular, dark, vanilla and irish cream would really be perfect!

review/text: I love all of the cocoa in the Stephen's Gourmet line, but I think this one is my favorite. The other people in my family have different favorites (we all love Stephen's), but we all agree the Belgian Dark ranks at the top for the best all-purpose drinking cocoa.<br /><br />I like my cocoa with a little added milk in it, and starting out with a good DARK cocoa allows me to achieve that milky texture without sacrificing that rich chocolate flavor.<br /><br />As an added bonus, Stephen's cocoa is labeled "Gluten Free" -- taking the guesswork out of choosing a cocoa for those of us who must avoid gluten-containing additives such as barley malt (a common ingredient in chocolate).

review/summary: Taste is individual
review/text: I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.<br />vs<br />Nestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.<br /><br />Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Nestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1g<br /><br />I first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldn't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate.

review/text: I bought a case of this stuff (Dark Chocolate) based on the positive reviews. Big mistake. This is half a step above Swiss Miss. It is definitely not up to the level of Archer (Target brand), Twinings (some grocery stores), or Cadbury (overseas or very few grocery stores).<br /><br />Cocoa is the 4th ingredient. No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient. That's more like it.<br /><br />Stephen's chocolate has bad/very light color, little aroma, thin, doesn't dissolve. A very disappointing purchase.

review/text: This review is for their dark chocolate. Most who like dark chocolate are into the pure chocolate taste and its health effects...not the sweetness! Just as with good coffee, its not necessary to make it overly sweet or flavored since there aren't that many sweet-freak-fatties drinking it. The ancient Incas didn't use any sugar at all with their chocolate!<br /><br />I did give it an extra star just for having a dark chocolate drink product since their aren't many companies that even make one, so kudos to them for that.

review/text: I bought some of this chocolate for my mother who can't have much caffeine. She used to drink Nestle hot cocolate, fat free-caffeine free, but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches. Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephen's on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its "food". and the company who makes it basically said "Sorry, but it sucks to be you". So here I sit, 110 dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use.

review/text: I liked the beans. They were vacuum sealed, plump and moist. Would recommend them for any use. I personally split and stuck them in some vodka to make vanilla extract. Yum!

review/summary: Great Beans
review/text: These beans arrived fast. They were moist, fresh and smell great! I purchased 5 shot sized bottles of bourbon and put one bean in each. They are going to be great Christmas gifts for the bakers in my life. I will order these again soon for actual baking.

review/summary: Vanilla Beans
review/text: Vanilla beans at the grocery store are expensive.  Some of my recipes require vanilla bean..and this is a great way to go.  Used it in a recipe from Inna Garten Couer La Crema, which is extremely yummy.  Bought from this company before and will do it again.  Great product with great wrapping....

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: I purchased these beans to make a particular cookie recipe. I was afraid to buy them, because I've always been leery of buying food products online. These beans came in moist, soft, and perfect. The fragrance was fabulous and the flavor was superb. My friends adored the recipe and I believe these beans were the deciding factor that made them more delicious than when making them with grocery store purchased beans.

review/summary: Vanilla Heaven
review/text: I ordered these to try making my own vanilla extract and I only wish I had ordered more! They were nicely packaged and smelled amazing right out of the envelope and through the plastic. They were fat, juicy and easy to split open and scrape. My vanilla extract is brewing now. Great price, fast ship and looking forward to delicious results.
