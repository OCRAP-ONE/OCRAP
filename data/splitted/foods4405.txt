review/summary: Coconut oil fan, here
review/text: I really like to use coconut oil for baking. It produces a much lighter end product than shortening does, and it's much better for you. Also, surprisingly, there's no heavy coconut taste. For health purposes, I also stir a teaspoonful into my coffee in the morning. Nutiva Coconut Extra-Virgin Oil works just fine. My only gripe: unlike with olive oils, as far as I know, there's no such thing as EXTRA virgin coconut oil. It's the same thing as virgin coconut oil. I suppose they label it that way for marketing purposes, but I never like to promote a myth. In any case, Nutiva works in every way that I expect it to, and buying the 54 ounce jar of Nutiva is the most economical way that I have found to buy it.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I've tried two of the major coconut oil brands that I order via the internet. I've been using the oil in food and on my skin for about 5 years. I ordered this just to see how it tasted because the price was so good, if it didn't taste right, I'd just use it on my skin. It is the BEST tasting oil I've tried. Tropical Traditions, Coconut Oil Supreme pale in comparison. This is truly a coconut oil you could eat right out of the jar. If you want to try a coconut oil that tastes as good as it smells, this is it. And the price is fabulous. Yea, Nutiva and Amazon!

review/text: I love this coconut oil!  It has a delicate coconut aroma and flavor. I have only just started using it but have found it to be delicious when making pancakes in lieu of using butter.  I have also used it as a substitute for butter when making grilled cheese sandwiches and baked sweet potatoes. It will do wonders for your hair and skin too.  I especially like using it as a hot oil treatment for my hair. I mix the coconut oil with a few drops of lemon essential oil and rub it into my hair.  It smells like dessert and good for my hair and scalp. Try it with your favorite essential oils!<br /><br />Warning:  It melts at 76F.  Be careful when opening a jar that's been sitting in a warm cupboard.

review/summary: It's a win win thing.  And I even like the smell!
review/text: The skin is a great delivery system for absorbing things into your body. So what are you putting on your skin? Read the ingredients on your handcream or body lotion.  Are they good for you?  Don't know?  Can you even pronounce them?  Let's keep it simple.  Virgin organic coconut oil.  Snowy white, unrefined, heavenly smell - this stuff is terrific!!  Solid at room temperature, smooth and buttery and melts at 76 degrees; cook/fry with it on low heat for a healthy and fragrant alternative to all those ulgy refined oils and hydrogenated trans fats (YUCK!), use as a lighter butter or shortening alternative (there's not a lot of flavor and the smell is intoxicating); use as hand cream (rub it on - only gets greasy if you really over load the area) I use it as a body lotion all over my body (my skin feels soft and smooth like it did when I was a child), hair conditioner (a light deep conditioner); anti-fungal properties (put it between your toes for goodness sake!) make-up remover - voila!  ear wax? I put a tiny bit of this on a q-tip; moist toilette wipes? ssshh... try a touch of this on your t.p. - and I could go on and on...  It must be organic and virgin coconut oil - anything else is something else and unexceptable.  I understand that it is fine for diets, and speeds up the metabolism (its those little medium fatty acid chains). Don't take my word for it - read all about it for yourself!  And yes, I feed it to my dog and cat, my cat loves it - and he won't eat anything! Actually, I don't think that he can resist the smell, I can't! Another one of those items that I out on my favorite things list!

review/summary: THIS STUFF IS INCREDIBLE!!!
review/text: This is amazing.  I like it better than all other coconut oils.  Of course it tastes like coconut.  I don't want to use oils that are so overly processed and refined that they taste like "nothing".  I don't understand why the coconut flavor bothers some people.  If you don't like coconut, find a different oil.<br /><br />You can use this for grilling, frying, baking, sauteeing, greasing & flouring a cake pan, and all other places that you'd use butter or a Crisco-type product.  Just be careful on the baking because this melts at a low temperature.<br /><br />It is amazing as a skin softener, a hair conditioner, a leave in hot oil treatment, make-up remover, eyelash conditioner/glosser, shaving "cream", lip softener, cuticle oil, nail conditioner, bath oil, after bath oil, massage oil (add a few drops of essential oil if you wish), etc.  Speaking of massage oil, this is an excellent product for "adult activities" . . . as a perk it is definitely edible.<br /><br />If you have dry feet, slather this on, rub it in, wrap your feet with plastic wrap, cover with socks, and go to bed.  In the morning your feet will feel nice and soft.<br /><br />This can be used on leather such as shoes, jackets, and purses.  Because it's clear, you can use it on leather products that have decorative stitching that you can't cover with regular colored polish.  (In fact, I just bent over and put coconut oil on my black leather shoes with my fingers . . . the only clean up needed was to rub my hands together.)<br /><br />I've even used it on my wood furniture to obtain the same results as furniture oils.  I have used it to grease hinges and mechanical parts.  I have heard that you can use it to add lustre to pearls but I'm too chicken to try it on my good stuff.<br /><br />I know people that have used it as a laxative (in large quantities) and a diet aid.  When I eat about a T. a day my skin is softer and my wrinkles are less noticable.<br /><br />I keep finding new uses.  I'm sure you'll find some, too.

review/summary: Endless uses!  Great product! You gotta try it.
review/text: This is the best brand! [[ASIN:B000VUMSE0 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 54 oz]I have been using more and more coconut oil for the past for months. First it was for facial moisturizer than learned how great it is for a whole body moisturizer. Use as you would baby oil. The I tried for my baby who has eczema and is allergic to just about all the "pure" and "natural" products out there. His skin drinks it in and leaves it super moisturized and smooth. No more cracks and irritation. Great for all seasons. My husband uses after shaving as do I. I love it for cooking, No more olive and canola. If you do your research this should be your only cooking oil. Whether savory or sweet or deep frying and sauteing. Has a very mild taste, my husband doesn't even notice the difference. Also try in your hair as a conditioner, hot oil treatment or sealant also cuticles. I am an african american woman with natural 4a hair. I can't say enough about this. I started with the 16oz, but the more I used this the more I found that I needed a larger size. To my amazement I found this gigantic size. I put some in my smaller containers and leave one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom, one in the baby room and the largest one in the kitchen. Can't get enough of coconut oil.

review/summary: No worries about plastic leaching
review/text: I wrote this to ease the worries of those who read some of the lower starred reviews complaining about the plastic container and possible "leaching" of harmful byproducts into the oil.  Turn your Nutiva jar upside down and read inside the little recycle triangle.  See the little "1" symbol and the PETE written under it?  That's a good plastic:  "#1 is Polyethylene Terephthalate, also marked as PET or PETE. Companies normally use this plastic for various beverage containers such as water, soft drinks, and sport drinks. You can also find this plastic for ketchup, peanut butter, salad dressings, jellies, and various other condiments. This plastic is known as one of the "good" plastics since it is not known to leach, or gradually penetrate, chemicals into the products it houses." [...]<br /><br />Also, don't worry about the clear container--coconut oil is highly resistant to becoming rancid from heat/light, unlike olive, corn, and other oils.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Can't Beat Nutiva's Organic Coconut Oil for Taste or Texture
review/text: I first tried coconut oil last fall after reading The Coconut Oil Miracle (***highly recommended book***) and Nutiva's Organic Coconut Oil was the first I tried. It spoiled me completely. I've since tried two other brands and NOTHING tastes as fresh and light as this oil.  It has a nice coconut flavor and personally, I love the taste it gives fried eggs and even pancakes.  I also used it to make a pie crust (after chilling the oil slightly to compensate for the friction of working the pie crust) for a coconut cream pie and it was out of this world--flaky and delicious!!!  Like another poster, I also like it spread on a toasted English muffin and then topped with a light drizzle of honey.<br /><br />Our family has changed our eating habits in the last year and now we use only 3 fats:  1.  Coconut Oil 2.  Butter 3.  Extra Virgin Olive Oil (but only raw---never with heat!!!!--use the coconut oil or butter for fried & sauteed foods).  Our general health is much improved; my husband's cholesterol levels are finally dropping (after YEARS of using "SmartBalance" and other "healthy" spreads that just raised his cholesterol).<br /><br />Try this coconut oil and do yourself a favor and order <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)</a>so you can understand why it not only tastes so good, but is so good for you!

review/summary: If you like coconut, this oil is great!
review/text: It has a slight coconut taste, but not overpowering.  I originally first tried the stuff at Walmart, and it had no flavor to it at all, very bland.<br /><br />To combat some of the poor reviews I read on this oil, I think a lot of those are just due to people not doing their research before buying, and thus they're just being snippity pickeys.  Obviously since it has a coconut taste, you may not want to use it for all your cooking needs.  When I cook Italian foods, I use olive oil.  When making something like mayonaise, I use canola oil.  A little common sense doesn't hurt most folks.  (It tastes great on toast with a little cinnamon sprinkled on it.)<br /><br />As for it being hard as a rock....I haven't noticed that.  Scoops out very easily. But again, a little research, and you'll find that it is a solid until the temperature reaches approximately 76-78�F, then it turns liquid.  Thus, there shouldn't be much of an issue of "melting it" to cook something as one person stated.  Any other type of oil you usually  heat before you start cooking.<br /><br />It does work great as a lotion on your skin.  It actually absorbs into the skin, and after it's absorbed, it doesn't leave an oily residue like you'd think it would.  I would recommend doing it at night before bed, or if you have some time before going out or whatever, because it's not instantly absorbed.  And a little goes a long way.  Leaves skin very smooth.<br /><br />I've also started using this in my hair after I wash/condition it.  Again, it actually absorbs into the hair and doesn't appear oily.  I use it only on the middle to the ends.  I've noticed my hair is softer, very shiny, and it helps bring out my natural curls without looking as frizzy.  It also makes me long hair much easier to comb.  Obviously, use in moderation, again a little will go a long way, a light coating is all that's needed.  And, it washes out fairly easy.  If you use too much, you'll feel it, and just do a second shampoo rinse.<br /><br />My dogs also get a teaspoon every day, and look forward to it.<br /><br />For those that say they're going to stick to butter, so be it.  You already know that's bad for you.  And margarine...even worse.  I think it's high time people started looking back to the "old days" and other countries that don't have the health problems we do here in the "industrialized" world.  Not saying coconut oil is the savior, but I think it's a good start.<br /><br />Cheers!

review/text: This is my favorite coconut oil for eating and moisturizing both.  It is unrefined virgin coconut oil and has that great coconut smell (and taste!).  If you want odorless / tasteless coconut oil - make sure you purchase the REFINED coconut oil.<br /><br />Coconut oil has never made me nauseous and this one is no different - it's one of the best, highest quality oils I've ever had and I highly recommend from everything from cooking (does not degrade at high heat like olive oil) to moisturizing (coconut glow and super shiny hair!).<br /><br />Bought a smaller size initially and went through it in no time flat. The gallon size lasts me a good 3-4 months (cooking and moisturizing).<br /><br />Editing this on 05/19/2012: "perfect price" at the time, by the way, was $56.15 shipped via Amazon Prime.

review/summary: Miracle product
review/text: I hate when people throw around the words Miracle Product about anything.  It sounds so douchey.  So... I've decided that would be the title of my review.  I think in general, coconuts are one of the most insanely useful nuts/fruits/things(?) found in nature.  Coconut water is extremely delicious (Amy & Brian's brand or C2O, the other brands can be meh), coconut milk is a great substitute for milk in certain non-dairy applications for all you hipster vegans, and Tom Hanks made a best buddy out of a whole coconut.<br /><br />Coconut oil, when it comes in the pressed extra virgin form, like with Nutiva or the other kinds you can purchase thru GNC, Vitamin World, etc. is also a miracle product.  It has a lot of applications.  It stays solid at room temperature which is pretty gnarly.  That's not a pro nor a con, just wanted to get that out there.  Knocking over an open container of this oil doesn't mean you have a mess to clean up, it just means your a klutz.  It's great for hair care, so say my black friends.  I have pretty thick hair so I don't really need it for that.  It's awesome for skin care too, like for acne scarring or minor skin blemishes.  It's completely anti-fungal and antibacterial so that means it's an all natural lubrication.  That last one was not something I have any personal experience with either, it's just something I wanted to type to make any readers still here uncomfortable.  But it's true according to many "What to use coconut oil for" websites.  It's also good to add as a means of healthy fat to a protein shake or vegetable concoction a la Joe Rogan Experience kale shakes in the morning.  Lastly, the real thing I use it for, is baking.  It's a substitute for butter at a ratio of 1:1, and a substitute for shortening at .75:1, meaning 3/4 cup of coconut oil is 1 cup of shortening.  Check this page out:<br />[...]<br /><br />The ChezUs recipe for banana bread is awesome.  Ok, I'm not writing any more stuff about coconut oil, don't be so goddamn lazy, go research (google) it on your own.  I was just supposed to write 20 words on this product but started my rant.  Buy it.  Or don't.  I don't really care what you do.  But if you do buy it, buy the 54 fl oz. jar like I did because it doesn't really spoil, more is better, and because I said so.

review/summary: The Only Coconut Oil I'll Ever Use!
review/text: When it arrived the oil was melted but that was to be expected after walking around with it going to class in SC. When I got back to my dorm it was already beginning to thicken up. I was also very happy to see that there was no spill. I got this coconut oil to use in my hair and I could not be happier. My hair is really soft and it seems like its melts away kinks and tangles that can come with hair 7 weeks post relaxer. My hair is super soft, moisturized, and shiny. I'm also seeing less breakage and shedding. At first I thought the oil smelled weird, but it's probably because I don't know what fresh coconut smells like. It smells spicy like pumpkin at first and then I smell coconut and I'm like ooooooh okay, that smells really good. I plan on buying a fresh coconut just so I can know what it smells like. It also feels great on my skin; it soaks in almost instantly and leaves my skins soft while feeling like I didn't put anything on at all. Before I did anything with it, I tasted it, to me it didn't taste like anything, it was only a little though. I'll probably still buy a separate jar for food purposes because of the health benefits.<br />All in all I'm extremely happy with this purchase and I will only buy this brand of coconut oil. I bought coconut oil from a natural diy/aromatherapy site that wasn't living up to the known benefits of coconut oil when used in your hair, it also wasn't unrefined and I think it is the cause of seborrheic dermatitis that I'm currently dealing with. But since I've stopped using that coconut oil that issue is just about nonexistent. So make sure what ever oil you are using is unrefined and organic!

review/summary: I keep coming back to Nutiva
review/text: I've tried other brands of VCO, but I keep coming back to Nutiva. It's well blended and smooth, and the flavor is the best of all I've tried. I love it and use it for all kinds of cooking. It's especially good for cooking bitter greens like turnips or collards; the coconut taste helps cut the bitterness, giving a marvelous flavor to the greens.<br /><br />I've discovered a fantastic way to make healthy popcorn using VCO. I've tried the stovetop method in the past using olive oil, but it's always burned my pot. What I do now is put a great heaping tablespoon of VCO into my 10-quart Fagor canning pot, melt it at 390 on my induction burner, dump in popcorn kernels to just cover the bottom in a single layer, and put on a glass lid I have that fits the pot. Then I just follow through with the popping process, jiggling the pot a little to keep the unpopped kernels falling to the bottom as the kernels pop. I listen for the popping to slow, just like you do with microwave popcorn, and then just turn off the induction burner and let the pot sit a minute while the last few kernels pop. This makes a wonderfully VCO-coated popcorn that can be enjoyed without salt if necessary, or add just a little fine popcorn salt and toss.

No more $1200 vet bills for that issue and her sadness from the face cage. Tastes and smells wonderful, just like coconut. Not at all petroleum greasy on skin and hair. ordering 3rd jar so I will have a good stock on hand.

review/summary: Yum.  Goodbye Crisco!
review/text: The other reviewers weren't kidding.  I could seriously eat this stuff with a spoon.  It's glorious.  I've stopped using Crisco and started using Nutiva Certified Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil in place of it.  I haven't found a recipe yet where it didn't work.  It does lend a coconut flavor to everything, so if coconut's not your thing, this may not be a great product for you.

review/summary: Goodbye hypothyroidism!
review/text: I don't have to reiterate all the known benefits of coconut oil, the effects are well known. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in 2010, and had been suffering from weight gain and sluggishness since. I read about how the oil could treat hypothyroidism so I started taking a tablespoon on toast every morning. Fast forward to 2012, and my thyroid test says my thyroid is perfect. My doctors were stumped. Couldn't be happier with the product. Tastes great too.

review/summary: Delicious Product!!
review/text: I recently heard about the great benefits of coconut oil and was wanting to give it a try.  I first bought a small jar from my local Walmart.  It had no flavor whatsoever and I felt like I was missing something.  Come to find out I needed Organic, Cold Pressed, Extra Virgin coconut oil.  The ones I found were not.  It was suppose to have a delicious coconut smell and light flavor.  I came to Amazon because I appreciate being able to read reviews of buyers before actually spending my money on an item.  Nutiva is an exceptional product.  Exactly what I was looking for. I am now addicted to toast with coconut oil(in place of butter) and jelly.  OMG!  I can't get enough.  I crave it every morning.  I was scared of all the saturated fats until I learned that not all saturated fats are bad for you (contrary to popular beliefs).  The studies that have been done on people for lowering the bad cholesterol and other benefits sold me. I would compare it to how the medical profession said eggs were bad for you and now they say they are good for you.  I am almost out and am definitely buying more.  Maybe the smaller containers though just to make it easier to reach the bottom with my teaspoon. Great product!

review/text: This is my first time trying coconut oil. I can not believe how great it tastes. Almost as good as butter. Sure hope it as healthy as it has been declared.It does not have to be refrigerated. But if room temperature is about 77 degrees it will turn to liquid. So I refrigerate it on the hot days so I can use it as a spread for my bagel.

review/summary: Coconutty, mmmmmm.
review/text: The oil was just right, very good texture/smell.  Great size- it's a two hander.  Works not only as a supplement, but also as a moisturizer for skin/hair as well. This oil is mild, not overwhelming in the least when used as a butter substitute or while cooking; you really can eat this straight off the spoon if you're so inclined. I was able to convince a skeptical man and two little ones to eat this. They love it and request it when given a choice between butter or oil. It's worth a try and there is a multitude of research in support of the health benefit(s) from adrenal/thyroid to dental maintenance... This has got to be one of the most painless ways to eat healthier.

review/summary: candida diet
review/text: I have been using this product for cooking and putting it on sprouted bread for awhile now.  I stopped using it about 3 weeks ago because i was craving butter lol.  About 4 days ago, i broke out in a rash under my armpit.  Its a yeast infection!  After researching how to get rid of that (ive been using tea tree oil for that on surface), i started researching candida (fungus/yeast overgrowth) and coconut oil!  To my surprise, by my using it all this time it was keeping the yeast in check enough.  Ive changed my diet slowly and have been eating good with occasional slip ups.  Now the candida is taking over!  Im back to using coconut oil in my foods and will add it more often as i go.  Not just coconut oil, but other virgen coconut products like milk and just plain coconut.  Ordered some probiotics and a detox tea called "holy tea".  Time to get the gut healthy!  MOST americans have an overgrowth of yeast in the body.  After looking at all the symptoms (there are tons of them) seems like its been a problem for awhile now, but who knows until you get "thrush" (white coating on tongue, which my doctor didnt even tell me was from candida) or an armpit rash.  Thank you for selling a product that is healthy and works for so many things!!!!

review/text: Actually, I'm on my 3rd jar of this Coconut Oil.  I use it in cooking, in my coffee, and on my skin.  In fact, this oil has cleared up problems that I have had on my cheeks, little white bumps, almost completely!<br />I love sauteing chicken in the oil as it helps keep it moist and also has a delicious flavor with the chicken; a plus are that the pan scrapings are delish! :)  I also add a teaspoon to each cup of coffee I drink.  I don't use sugar for sweetening but do use half and half but have found that I need less cream when I add the oil.  I started using a tablespoon but that was too much in that I almost couldn't leave the house, if you know what I mean.<br />There is a book I reviewed about coconut oil too so if you are a "coconut oil beginner", I suggest reading the book I reviewed as it has a lot of useful information.

review/summary: Great Decision!
review/text: Over the last few months,I've been becoming more and more aware of the fact that everyday products we use such as our lotions and toothpastes and hair care products etc. are actually items which contain chemicals and products harmful to us such as fluoride for example in toothpastes which is also in water supplies. Being that I'm a male who's only 23, I have slowly wanted to switch to more healthy,organic products for my health and body as I recently did with my toothpaste,a fluoride free brand called Tom's of Maine. I decided to do the same with my lotions and hair care products. I did research of what products,organic,which can also be consumed,can best be used for these purposes,especially hair, and after reading about apple cider vinegar and virgin coconut oil I decided to go with the coconut oil because I can use it on my body as well,and man was it a great decision! The first noticeable thing about the coconut oil is the smell...DELICIOUS. I find myself just opening the top and having a whiff before I'll even use it sometimes. Also,the actual feel and convenience of the product is great. It's a great alternative to high fat butter products. It makes my skin feel smooth and my hair is always soft and my scalp dries nowhere near as horrible as it used to. Really,in this last month,I find it harder and harder to find dandruff present. When I'm out of the shower,I don't have to have 2 or 3 or 4 different bottles for conditioner then grease then lotion,etc. I have it all in this one container! I simply rub a bit in my hands to melt it,massage it through my hair and when I finish my hair,I move to my face and so on. It's great! It smells amazing,it's convenient,and it's healthy in terms of the fatty acids it contains which our bodies need. I know it's "different strokes for different folks",but I'd recommend this oil to anybody. If you use it for foods and personal hygiene like myself,I recommend the 54 oz. container. BTW,super fast shipping! I ordered on a Sunday morning,I had it Tuesday morning and was using it Tuesday night!

The taste is good spread on bread in place of margarine  and mixed in with vegetables.  It needs no refrigeration and works well to fry eggs or grill sandwiches.  It is supposed to be good for the skin also.  Despite a slightly higher cost over butter or margarine it is worth it if our minds improve.  Time will tell...

review/text: This is my first time trying Coconut Oil so I wasn't sure which brand to try first so what my wife and I did was buy this one (Nutiva) and also bought Artisana 100% Organic Raw Coconut Oil Extra Virgin --We read many reviews on both some saying they liked one vs the other so we just decided let's try them both. They arrived today, we opened them both and took our first taste of both. The Artisana brand we both agreed was kinda blah. The Nutiva brand we were both licking our lips because it tasted so much like a Almond joy candy bar. The coconut flavor is delicious!! If you want coconut oil without the coconut taste go for something like the Artisana or maybe another brand, but if your looking for the coconut flavor NUTIVA is the one!!! We will be buying more and will be buying the large size because we know for a fact we will be using this daily.

review/summary: High Quality Coconut Oil
review/text: I purchase coconut oil for non-food purposes - hair, skin, nails, feet; I use a heaping teaspoon in my hair once a week for fifteen minutes, which keeps it incredibly soft and hydrated.  It's great added to a hot bath or used to oil the skin.  Terrific cure for tough feet in just a few applications.  It's definitely helped soften my facial skin and lessen the appearance of fine lines.<br /><br />This particular coconut oil is excellent - very smooth and free of graininess, it melts into a soft pure oil in your hands.  It has a very light, clean, coconut-butter scent - very pleasing.  It's a very large amount for the money and the best quality I've found of the half dozen brands I've tried over the years.

review/summary: Nothing like Nutiva.
review/text: This stuff is nothing short of amazing. I love it and my only grief is that they don't seem to sell it outside of the US, so I have to have folks bring it to me when they come with them on the airplane. I use it as a face moisturizer, to cook, bake, as a hair mask and soon I will be using it as nipple cream for breastfeeding and as baby bum cream. It's the one product I can't live without. The price for the size is a great bargain, because I can pay this much in the health food store for a much smaller size jar. Thank you Amazon.

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: I use this product on my body and hair. IT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!! it moisturizes like no other. i use it on my hair as a light deep conditioner. i put it on my hair before i wash my hair.like a hot oil treatment. i just let it marinate in my scalp and stuff. and then i wash my hair. it leaves it soooo soft and it even detangles!!! and it leaves my hair feeling strong and it is growing. but be careful if u use too much on ur hair it will become very very greasy and heavy. u only need a tad. okay next, i use it on my skin! i wash my face and i put it on my face afterwards. it leaves my face feeling extremely soft, clean and moisturized. also, it doesnt clog my pores. and once or twice a week i will do a soothing bath with the coconut oil. a warm bath mixed with the oil, is sooooo heavenly. Lol. Also use it when i shower too. it leaves my skin feeling soo soft. like i have eczema and it doesnt irritate it at all. my skin loves this stuff. it melts fast and the smell will takes some getting used to. i havent tried cooking with it yet because i really just wanted to use it on my skin cause i have extremely sensitive skin and eczema and i needed something pure and organic. and honestly, i can see my skin clearing up. my eczema is less itchy and actually looks better and is under control. coconut oil is so vital to my everyday skin care regimen. best thing ever.

review/summary: LIKE THE OIL
review/text: I have only used one other brand of coconut oil and I thought I would stay with them because their quality was really good. But a good deal got me to try Nutiva. All I can say is YUM. It poofs of coconut smell when you open it. Part of what you taste with is what you smell, not just what you see. So I will stay with Nutiva because of that. The first brand I tried was a great brand. But I think Nutiva must be better if they can keep the original smell of the coconut in the finished product.

review/summary: Best Cocunut Oil
review/text: I have purchased several different brands of Organic Coconut oil. I use this for my Boys Exzema, making homemade deoderant and healing cuts. So since it is going directly on our skin and being absorbed instantly in the blood stream I am extremely picky about what I use for my family. Nutiva Coconut oil is by far the BEST coconut oil and I am very happy with the price as well. I have paid as much as $20 for a jar of coconut oil which was not even this high of quality. Overall you cannot go Wrong with this Coconut oil!

review/summary: Will Now Only Use Coconut Oil For The Rest of My Life!
review/text: I had high expectations when ordering Nutiva Coconut Oil because I had recently discovered that America has been lied to about unsaturated fats and saturated fats for years, and that if I want to lose weight, then I should stick to what my taste buds naturally love- Saturated fat!<br />Nutiva Coconut Oil has gone above and beyond meeting my expectations. I am blown away!<br />It satisfied what I expected:<br />1. The smell is pleasant and sweet, bold and aromatic.<br />2. The taste is full-bodied and rich.<br />3. Snow White in color, smooth and creamy texture. I could definitely see myself using a pat of this on my toast instead of butter.<br />4. After cooking it, the aroma of coconut fills the room.<br />5. The high heat tolerance of coconut oil is wonderful. It cooked my steak and burger perfectly. No longer will I deal with the smoking olive oil on the pan which indicates trans fat having been created.<br />6. No cholesterol, almost ALL saturated fat though- How can nature be so beautiful?<br /><br />Going BEYOND my expectations:<br />A. Out of curiosity last night, I dabbed some coconut oil on my chapped lips as soon as I opened the jar and laid eyes on the lovely white butter in front of me. This morning, as I'm writing this review, I lick my lips and feel that my lips are now smooth, soft, and not chapped at all! I am so amazed! That has never happened; it's like magic!<br />B. I just read that coconut oil may help to prevent and treat dementia and Alzheimer's. I am going to tell my parents immediately!<br /><br />If I could give ten stars, I would!

review/summary: It works for dry skin!!
review/text: I purchased the 15 oz size container of the Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil because I was looking for something that would help me deal with my dry skin symptoms based on other reviews and product info.  I thought why not give it a try nothing else seems to be working.  I was very surprised as how well it does work to keep my skin from drying out.  Usually put it on after taking a shower and/or shaving.  I will keep using this product until I can't use it anymore or I have to find something better.  This small container goes along way.  I purchased mine almost a year ago and still have plenty left for another year or more at least.  Highly recommend if you are trying cope with dry skin on a daily basis.

Also you can even put it in your hair for healthy, shiny locks.

review/text: It's HUGE!!  It's HIGH QUALITY!!  It's a bit much for our family of four, but we've had our vat for about two years now and still no hint of going rancid.  I've tried it for frying eggs, but I'm a sissy about the faint coconut taste on my eggs, so we just use it as the fat in banana bread and for the frying fat for pancakes or french toast.  As a beauty aid - just a touch rubbed first into my hands and then into my dry hair really sinks into the hair shaft and keeps things moisturized and shiny.  Nothing seems to beat it in performance, and it's so darn cheap. Also a good additive-free skin moisturizer.  You might want to divvy it up into multiple clean containers when it arrives.

But it didn't start out that way. I got two jars of it and based on the consistency and smell I was planning to return it, but gave a try and massaged it all over my body before bedtime - I could not belive how soft my skin felt in the morning - one of the reviewer said it feel like baby skin and I couldn't agree more. I am going to use this oil from now on and give it to my children. And I don't like coconut smell but the smell in this oil is not overpowering and actually quite nice. I think the more I use it the more I am going to love it. Definitely buy it.

review/summary: Nutiva Coconut Oil
review/text: After learnging the benefits of coconut oil, I decided to give it a try.  While I was shopping at GNC store, I was very excited to see the coconut oil on their shelves.  I purchased a jar, but when I tried it... that's a diffrent story.  The taste was making me want to throw up.  Instead of giving up on it, each time I would take a spoonfull, I would pull my tongue in and hold my breath, so that I couldn't smell or taste it.  Well, after one week I decided to check amazon and I found out that Nutivia had the best reviews and I went ahead and ordered it (ordered it from Nutivia website as it was a little cheaper).  What a difference ! ! ! This coconut oil is amazing... It looks, smells, and tastes so fresh.  I just started to do oil pulling [...] and I found the best benefits with coconut oil. I would recommend this product to everyone !!!

review/text: This is 100% organic, unrefined coconut oil.  Yes, it tastes like coconut, but it is supose to.  A food should taste like what it is!<br /><br />The nutritional value of this food is outstanding.  It contains a lot of lauric acid which is also found in mothers milk and is both antifungal and antimicrobial.  It is stable at room temperature and does not become rancid quickly like other popular cooking oils.  It requires very high heat to release free radicals (I do prefer red palm oil for high heat cooking options because it does not release free radicals at all).<br /><br />My Suggested Uses:  smoothies, slow cooked baked goods, sauteed foods, mixed with maple syrup over popcorn, homemade cosmetics, and as an occasional conditioner for dry ends of long hair.

review/summary: COMPARISON REVIEW to Nature's Way
review/text: When I learned about the many benefits and uses of coconut oil I had to try it, so I ordered 2 jars -one for my pantry for cooking/smoothies etc. and one for my bathroom to use as a body cream. Since I didn't know what brand to choose and didn't have any prior experience with coconut oil I decided to get one jar of the NUTIVA brand and one jar of the NATURE'S WAY brand.<br /><br />Here's my initial opinion of both: With my Nutiva jar there's a sticker indicating the expiration date and package/creation date of the actual oil, whereas with my Nature's Way jar there's nothing like that. When I opened both of them up to try and to just generally check them out I tasted a tiny amount of both and it was very clear that the Nutiva jar's coconut oil tasted much better. I'm not sure exactly why, but to me the Nature's Way coconut oil didn't taste as good, it was kind of toasty in a bad way.<br /><br />It was very easy for me to decide to use the Nutiva brand coconut oil for my cooking and in my smoothies and the Nature's Way coconut oil for my skin. I've since read that this difference in taste could be because the Nutiva brand coconut oil was fresher and the Nature's Way older. Or it could be quality, I'm really not sure. But I am sure that from now on I'm going to just be buying the Nutiva brand Coconut Oil (just ordered 2 more big jars of it). :)<br /><br />To say that the Nature's Way coconut oil was toasty still isn't exactly the right word -toasty sounds like something good... when it's so not, but I really can't think of a better word to describe the difference.<br /><br />I've found a lot of uses for coconut oil and have used it for many things with great results so far. It's hard to believe one little oil can do so much! Weird actually, but everything I've tried it with so far has had positive results.<br /><br />So here's a list of weird, random, but completely amazing things I've found coconut oil to do:<br /><br />-Works better than any make-up remover: seriously, just use a nickle size amount or less on your eyes to get all eye make-up off in a flash.<br /><br />-Helps clear up acne: One night after using it to take off my eye make-up I decided to use it as an all over face make-up remover... then decided my face felt so good I didn't want to use anything else (hint: leave the coconut oil on your face for a minute and then get your water and washcloth really really hot to wipe it all away). I googled to see if this was okay to do and it turns out coconut oil can help get rid of acne! You can use it as a facewash. Strange but true. BUT I also found out that Castor Oil works even better for this (and like coconut oil still moisturizes your face and keeps it from drying out), so I've ordered a small bottle of that to use instead in the future... but still, coconut oil has worked really well for me and apparently others. When you have skin like mine (I'm 25) that occassionally breaks out but still is a little dry sometimes it's hard finding the right balance and exactly the right thing to use -I feel like now I've figured out some great secret to getting it right.<br /><br />-You can use it as a deoderant: This one I read online and decided to try on a day where I wasn't really doing anything or working out. It felt weird -like I was putting some kind of lotion or body creme under my arms instead of my normal Secret deoderant. But guess what? It worked! I have since been trying it on days where I actually do work out and it STILL is working. Craziness! It keeps me dry and smelling good the same as my old deoderant did. AND there's no aluminum zirconium (have no idea how to spell that correctly) which I know is now supposedly bad for you (most deoderants still use it though) because it's connected/correlated with Alzheimers. So... an all natural, organic, one ingredient deoderant that feels like a body creme -doesn't get much better than that! Plus my underarms are looking softer/nicer. :)<br /><br />-You can use it on your scalp and hair: Now I've tried this several times and although I DO like the way it moisturizes my hair, I don't like the way my hair looks after I wash it out... it's just kind of lanky/heavy. Not in an extreme way or anything, but I like my hair to have lots of body. So while I do recommend coconut oil to help heal frazzled hair and stimulate hair growth I don't recommend doing it right before any big event in your life... maybe like a few days before so you get the benefit of the moisturized, healthy hair, without any worries about styling it. This is another one where I've looked it up and found that Castor Oil when massaged in the scalp can stimulate hair growth/fast hair growth even better -so now that I've got that bottle on the way to me from amazon I'll probably be using that instead, at least on my scalp.<br /><br />-You can use it as a body creme and even a BODY WASH. Yepp. A body WASH. Sounds crazy, but it makes my skin look SO good. Better than it's ever looked actually. Coconut oil has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties (and of course is moisturizing) and will clean your skin while hydrating it. So no harsh chemicals or detergents touch your skin -and if you have sensitive skin like I do, well this stuff might just be your new best friend, must-have, can't live without it ever, stuff! I used to have a minor skin problem on my arms that I absolutely hated. Just general redness, sensitivity, and tiny little red dots on the tops of my arms (that I've had since childhood). Now I absolutely don't -and it's literally all because of coconut oil. Maybe it's because I'm not putting soaps/bodywash on my skin anymore or maybe it's because coconut oil is really that awesome, but it has basically cured my arms and has made the skin all over my body look amazing! I seriously can't believe how good it makes my skin look! The best thing to do is to literally use it like a body wash all over -rinse off and then either just towel dry and go or towel dry and then reapply again if your skin is dry or it's winter or you live in a dry climate. When you reapply you're going to have to have some kind of small towel to wipe off excess with before you put on clothes. Either way it makes your skin look great. :) You can also use it to shave with apparently but I haven't tried that. I'm using it to make my own homemade body scrubs and of course using it as a body creme and loving it!<br /><br />-You can feed it to your dogs (one tablespoon a day) to make their coats shiny. (I've been giving it to both my dogs, although not every single day and they love it.<br /><br />-It can help you lose weight. Apparently it has a lot of really GOOD for you fats that your body doesn't treat like other fats and it actually helps you lose weight (learned this from Dr. Oz). Plus it tastes good when you cook with it and put it in smoothies. Actually I LOVE it in smoothies, it just adds an extra tropical coconut flavor. :-)<br /><br />-You can use it for Oil Pulling.<br /><br />-You can use it as a lip balm.<br /><br />Plus I know there's so much more but that's all I can think of right now! Basically it's really good stuff that I am now believing everyone should have in their home! :-)

review/summary: BEST FLAVOR; BEST PRICES; ALWAYS FRESH
review/text: I've been using the Nutiva brand for 2 years now.  It has the best flavor of any of the brands in the nutrition and grocery stores.  When I used the other brands I rarely used the coconut oil.  They smelled and tasted yucky.  Plus I found out they were processed.  Nutiva is raw.  I have completely thrown out shortening; butter; and probably cut back at least half on the olive oil I used.<br />My chronically dry skin is gone without lotions.  I use it on toast or bread as a snack and I feel full and satisfied for hours. And I have seen a lot less water retention all over....not so puffy.  Wish I could say I lost weight or inches, but no, I didn't.  I have heard of others losing as soon as they start switching to coconut oil.  When I bake with it instead of shortening or butter...everything is so moist...no coconut flavor added to anything either.

review/summary: Superior product!
review/text: I have just recently begun using VCO for nearly all of my cooking.  After purchasing two books on the benefits of coconut oil, I have purchased several different brands of oil.  The Nutiva Organic EVCO is by far a superior oil with a delightful flavor.  The price from Amazon if you are a Prime member is the best I have found for this quality of oil.<br /><br />I began eating the oil mixed in about 1/2 cup of cottage cheese because I read on a forum that cottage cheese has properties which help the body assimilate the oil.  Since then I have expanded to many other uses.  I use the oil to sautee garlic, onions, peppers, etc for all of my soups and stir frys.  I spread it on toast and add it to my corn bread.<br /><br />In just the first week of eating coconut oil regularly I noticed that my chronic aches in my joints and muscles subsided.  My skin is smoother and blemishes began to disappear.  I began using it as a topical ointment on my hands, feet and face along with knees and elbows.  It is a much better skin conditioner than almost anything else I have used.<br /><br />I found that it also works great as a conditioner for all of my wooden cooking utensils and I rub it into my cutting boards to condition them.  It is far superior to mineral oil!<br /><br />I have introduced the oil into my husband's diet also.  He has been a Type II diabetic for about 15 years and just turned 77.  He is beginning to notice positive benefits also.  He particularly has noticed more mental acuity.  He adds the oil to his morning cereal and spreads it on his toast and really enjoys the flavor.<br /><br />I am so happy to have found this wonderful Nutiva oil and appreciate its many benefits.  I find it kind of addictive.  I now look forward to adding the oil to more and more foods and it seems to make nearly everything, including eggs, soups, stews, casseroles, muffins and breads more delicious.  I highly recommend the Nutiva brand of Organic EVCO for a huge variety of uses.  To those who think it has too much coconut flavor - well, I guess you can't please everyone.  Try it and decide for yourself.  The health benefits are worth it!  This oil has given me a new energy and improved my health so positively that I would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />The only downside I can mention is the plastic container.  It would be better if it were packaged in glass, but hopefully all those anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties of the oil will negate the use of a plastic container ;-)

review/summary: Lovely Product for Hair and Skin!
review/text: I must admit I haven't tried cooking with this oil yet, but I'm certainly looking forward to it.  Instead, my review will focus on using Nutiva Organic Coocnut oil as a beautifying product.  I bought the 54-ounce jar for using on my hair and skin.  So here's what I think of it as part of a beauty/skincare/haircare regime.<br /><br />This is a fantastic product at a great price.  Sure, you could get a jar of coconut oil at the grocery store but it's quality wouldn't compare to Nutiva coconut oil which is food quality, organic, cold-pressed, and unrefined.  I was so excited when this product arrived that I tried it out immediately.  The first thing I noticed was the lovely smell.  The product smells good enough to eat straight out of the container and I admit I did taste a bit while applying it to my skin and hair.  My other observation is that it melts so easily in the hands and applies so well to both hair and skin.  My less expensive, refined Superdrug coconut oil cannot compare to Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil.  The cheaper coconut oils have hard, white bits in them and do not smell like actual coconut.  Nutiva is smooth/silky and melts easily in the hands without leaving behind white balls/clumps that the cheaper refined coconut oils have.  I love Nutiva so much that I emptied all my cheap Superdrug coconut oil into the rubbish bin and scooped some Nutiva Coconut oil into the little Superdrug canister and put it in my bathroom for easy access.  I am using Nutiva a few times a week on my body and hair.  Before bed, I scoop some Nutiva onto my hands and rub my hands together causing it to melt.  It melts quickly and I rub it onto my skin and hair (can be applied to wet, damp, or dry hair easily).  I saturate my hair with it and use a shower cap to do an overnight heavy oiling treatment.  In the morning I shower as normal and shampoo or condition it out using a clarifying conditioner.  This creates beautifully silky, shiny hair and skin! There are so many benefits to the body using this oil.  I highly recommend it and hope that it will always be sold on Amazon.

review/text: I have been studying the benefits of coconut oil for some time. I tried several different brands but when I opened a jar of the Nutiva I knew that I had found what I was looking for. Absolutely the freshest most wonderful organic virgin coconut oil on the planet.<br /><br />I substituted the butter and/or vegetable oil in several recipes with the Nutiva coconut oil and achieved incredible results. I even fried eggs in it last night and they were GREAT! I will never fry with any other oil again. I also use it as a spread on toast, bagels, and muffins.<br /><br />AAAAA+++++  Try it, you'll love it!

review/summary: Very pleased so far
review/text: Aside from digestive issues, I have suffered from adult acne in recent years. I have noticed a correlation between stress and breakouts (and that familiar female response once a month) however I have not yet found a complete system which had worked to eliminate my acne.<br />After reading of coconut oil and Lauric acid, I have put it on trial... and have thus far experienced some impressive results..! It took about 8 days before I noticed the large cysts subsiding, and they have stayed away now for several weeks. Even my monthly cyst is keeping in check. Who would have thought rubbing your face with coconut oil twice and day and taking it internally would make the oily patches on your face actually improve? It seemed a little counter-intuitive, but so far I am experiencing some very clear skin... for the first time in years... Of course, I believe in coupling the outside assault with an internal one, so I have been taking the coconut oil daily (usually on bread or I just add it to cereal) as well as a wonderful greens mix (powder) and a pro-biotic. Of course, water is paramount, and I drink plenty every day, but I always did... Finding your balance is the most important thing - what is right for some is not always right for all - I will report back in a few months to let you know if the coconut oil has continued to impress me.

review/text: Virgin coconut oil is great for your health and taste buds.<br /><br />I tried several different brands. I like this one a lot.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of coconut flavor, but this one smells different. It's preasant.<br /><br />Just 54-ounce jar was too big. I didn't have a sense of US unit. I recommend smaller jars if you don't bake often.<br /><br />You'll enjoy this oil as a substitution of butter and also you can use as your natural skin cream.

review/summary: Best Coconut Oil there is!!!
review/text: Best coconut oil ever!!!! I have used other brand of coconut oil like Vitamin shoppe but this one is different. Just the smell alone when you open the bottle.  The aroma of pure coconut smells my entire living room...<br /><br />First of all, this is a huge bottle---- 54 oz!!! Even our local Vitamin Shoppe does not carry this size in their store.<br /><br />I used this mainly because of my flaky, dry skin....right after taking a shower when your pores are still open is the best time to apply this all over...even your face. I live in Chicago and during the cold season- nothing really works for my skin but this product.<br /><br />I am familiar with coconut oil since i was born and grew up in the Philippines where this product may have originated.  We used it for everything including cooking.<br /><br />I also use this in my hair after i take a shower. makes my hair feels silky.  I also used this for back massage and to relieve muscle pain....<br /><br />It's really great to have coconut oil in your house because of its plenty of uses!!! The price here at Amazon is unbelievable!!! and with free shipping as well....Highly Recommended!!!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Well i finally trash my body lotions and use this instead as body lotion.  Winter here in Chicago can be so brutal that my whole body itches for days.  Best when use right after taking a shower.  I still use my Vanicreme as hand lotion.

I also love to use it on my skin,because it's sooooo good for it! The consistency of the coconut oil at room temperature makes it easy to spread....if it gets too warm in the house,though,the oil does turn liquidy,which can be disconcerting. All in all,coconut oil just can't be beat!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I was very happy with this purchase. I read all the positive reviews and I have to agree with most of them. The coconut oil tastes delicious, I kind of want to eat out of the jar- I'm not sure I can say this about any other oil haha. I spread the solid form a litte bit on some crackers to try it and it was delicious, I used it on some banana bread in place of regular butter- delicious. I haven't really noticed the flavor in any of the foods I cook. I made sauteed spinach and chicken nuggets. I actually fried the chicken nuggets and I think they came out quite well actually. I could go on, but overall I am very happy with this product and it is definitly money well spent.<br /><br />The only down side is I just got it on Saturday and less than a week later I already used half a jar- so my law student budget might be streched a little thin. It would be nice also to see if the claims that it helps you loose weight are true. I'll post an update if it helps since I have been trying to drop from a size 4 to a size 2 for forever and a day.
