review/summary: Edible
review/text: I read the other reviews and thought I would give this protein bar a try.  My taste buds must not be like the reviewers who liked this bar.  It was edible at best.  It has a smooth filling with an artificial taste and after taste. As one who started a weight watching quest with Tab in the early '60's (bad, bad after taste that still lingers 50 years later) I am willing to try a product on others recommendations. This one, though it has 20 grams of protein, is not worth a rebuy.  As I watch what I eat and look for low carb, high protein snacks, calories weren't key in this purchase.  If you want high protein and great taste, try the Questbar. It's like a rice crispy treat made from nuts.  thinkThin does make a very nice product in their thinkThin crunch bars.  I ordered the white chocolate dipped mixed nuts, and will keep on buying them.  I think they are crunchy and tasty.

review/summary: For the macros what do you expect
review/text: I had tried this bar before so I knew I liked it. Honestly White Chocolate is the best flavor. I received a fresh shipment from amazon and there was no doubt whether they were good quality or not. This bar is a chocolate nougat with a white chocolate coating. I personally don't find a chemical after taste but I usually eat sugar free products or usually eat food sans sugar, so be forewarned. If you prefer a sugar free taste then you are in for a treat because they are the closest you can get to a candy bar with zero sugar and 20g of protein.

review/summary: Terrible taste
review/text: I noticed that some people said that eating one was enough, but that's probably because of the taste. I've tried two other flavors of it before, one was chocolate, and I never liked them at all. I don't understand why some people say that it tastes like a candy bar, it looks really pretty, but then when you actually it bite into, it's terrible, b/c it's all mushy inside. Maybe buy one to try it, but don't buy in bulk unless you're sure you like it

review/summary: Normally Excellent but Amazon ships out damaged...
review/text: Normally, this are outstanding bars.  If you dont believe it, go to a local health food store and try one (Trader Joes sells them as well).  I subscribed via Amazon a few years ago, and for whatever reason the last 3 boxes have arrived damaged.  They have a awelfull tainted taste unlike ones that are found in local stores.  They had a yellowish color (normally off white), and looked like they had been melted several times over even though the expiration date was current.  The last box, Amazon said they would fix the issue but havent.  I cannot return them because of Amazons policy.  Also interesting, I wrote a review similar to this one regarding the same issue, but Amazon deleted it off the website.  In any event, I cancelled my subcription and will contact the makers of this good product to let them know that somewhwere in the shipment process it is being mishandeling.  I would venture to say that many of the one star reviews are from people who dont know what these bars should really taste like,

review/text: I'm not into white chocolate much- but with the sale price, I figured I'd give it a try.  This is soooo much better than I expected.  Note that it's a white chocolate covered protein bar- but the inside of the actual bar is NOT white chocolate.  It's a mild brown chocolatey coconut flavor.  I didn't expect it- but LOVE it!  If you're not into coconut, you may still want to try it.  It's not boldly strong- it has a perfect balance!  Again, exceeded my expectations!!!

review/summary: Zero sugar, great taste
review/text: I love this bar--BUT bear in mind that I have to try hard to find a zero-sugar food that's easy to grab and throw in my purse.  If you're just looking for something yummy, this may not be your favorite.  But if you're looking for zero sugar, it's almost impossible to find, and when you do find it, it usually tastes bad.  In fact, there are some chocolate or chocolate/peanut butter versions of this same product, and I HATE them.  Gross.  But the white chocolate tastes great.  Caveat:  They are 230 calories per bar, which is too many calories for me, so I cut them in half and keep each half in a ziploc bag in my cupboard for a quick grab when I'm running out the door.  Then we're down to only 215 calories, but still filling.  I love this bar.

review/summary: Pretty good!
review/text: I like the Think Thin bars for their nutritional profile, not so much for their taste.  I've tried the brownie and the dark chocolate and sometimes have to swallow hard to get them down, along with some kind of beverage.  When these arrived the first thing I noticed was how soft and chewy and "fresh" they tasted- in comparison to the others which are very firm, if not hard, bars.  Wow.  That makes all the difference.  These went down like a dream, and while I'm not going to say you will love them like a Snickers, I will say that they don't taste bad at all and chew like a warm oatmeal cookie.  I am beginning to wonder if it is just this flavor which is so soft and tasty, or if my other bars are just old and hard.  All bought on Amazon, though.  In any case, they were MUCH better than expected!

review/summary: I took a chance... and I love them!
review/text: I have had mixed luck with many of the gluten free bars... some hard as a rock, crunchy and crumbly choke-to-death on, weird pasty flavors that are nothing like you imagine... On a whim I got a box of these ThinkThin White Chocolate Chip bars, and I was just going to struggle thru them if they were not as good as I had hoped...but I really really like them!  I'll admit the first bit I thought it was way too sweet and the white chocolate was a little weird tasting (isn't is always, really?!), but that faded away to the nice chocolate flavor with little choco crunchy bits.  They remind me of a denser 3 Musketeers bar only with white choco coating and the choco crunchy bits.  I am almost tempted to try to other flavors, but I am spoiled on these.

review/summary: one of Think Thin's best
review/text: I'm a pretty big fan of Think Thin's Chunky Peanut Butter bar and wanted to try some of the brand's other flavors; White Chocolate Chip sounded delicious.  I have to say that this bar has replaced Think Thin's Chunky Peanut Butter as my favorite.<br /><br />Think Thin's White Chocolate Chip bar has an exterior white coating and a tan center with mini chocolate chips.  The exterior coating is more similar to a vanilla flavor than a white chocolate flavor.  For those that enjoy sweets, this may be your ticket to fulfilling your sugar tooth and obtaining a decent amount of protein.  Note: The exterior coating is sensitive to heat so if you will be in warm temperatures, expect meting to occur.<br /><br />I found this bar to be moist and flavorful compared to the typical protein bar and even compared to Think Thin's other products. I'm not saying that you cannot taste the protein.  I don't know if that is something you can escape without massive amounts of sweetner.  It is a very edible option.  The ease of consumption is also appreciated. With some protein bars, you have to worry about chipping a tooth but this bar was easy to consume.<br /><br />These bars can really help you ride out a period of hunger.  I sometimes use them as breakfast bars and can go three to four hours before I feel like a snack or other breakfast item is needed.<br /><br />Think Thin's White Chocolate Chip protein bar has an admirable amount of protein and is sugar free.  Those with sensitivity to sugar alcohols and soy should probably pick another protein bar, however, because the bar contains both.

review/summary: Great Product, Great Price!!... my bars are fresher than Whole Foods too!
review/text: I'm very happy with these bars and Amazon's great price & quick shipping!!!!  I wanted a good, healthy, high protein, low glycemic, etc. meal replacement/ snack bar to eat on the go that I can keep on hand to help me reduce my caloric/ fat intake and stop me from eating unhealthy, fatty foods so I can shed a few pounds.  I went to Whole Foods and asked the employee working in the health bar area and she told me that this brand was a favorite for high protein, no sugar, and pretty good tasting.  She also told me that Chunky Peanut Butter and White Chocolate Chip were the favorite flavors.  I bought them both and liked them and saw that Amazon has them cheaper so I bought a box of each.  I was concerned when I read the reviews on here and someone said the bars were stale/ old/ not fresh, so I was prepared to send them back if need be. I checked the expiration date and they expire in a little more than a year.  I checked the wrapper of my bar from Whole foods and it expires 11 months from now.  Amazon's is fresher, go figure!!  Also, my boxes and bars in pristine condition (no melting or chemical smells or taste, as some reviewer said)  With subscribe & save I'm saving like 60%...LOVE IT!!

review/summary: Worst protein bar ever tasted!
review/text: Other reviewers here that gave this bar a good review must have been paid off by thinkthin.  Theses are the worst tasting protein bars I've ever tasted in my life.  At least other brands try to make their bar taste alright, thinkthin basically said nope, not even going to try.  The bar barely has any white chocolate taste to it.  The bar is bitter and dry.  It took me 30 minutes to finish 1 bar because it tasted so bad.  Will never buy another thinkthin product.

review/summary: BEST BARS EVER, BUT....................
review/text: These are the BEST BARS I HAVE EVER EATEN. I have one and my daughter has one EVERY day.<br /><br />And I shop on the internet whenever possible, so its not like I have something against Amazon, other online sellers, or UPS.<br /><br />But buy these bars at the store. The wonderful white chocolate covering on them melts when delivered by UPS, and although you can still eat it that ruins the bar, with chips of re-hardened white chocolate falling off every where.<br /><br />So BUY THESE BARS!!!!!THEY ARE INCREDIBLE, but buy them at the store.<br /><br />Apologies to Amazon, online sellers and UPS, but it is what it is................

review/summary: Bad.
review/text: I got a box of these yesterday, and at first I thought they were actually spoiled.  After I re-read the reviews, I realized that they are just that bad.  I usually try to throw in a positive, but I just cannot think of one.  If they tasted good and the carbs were not nearly as high (24g per bar) I would be happy to pay the money, but for how bad they taste and how they really aren't very low-carb diet friendly, 1 star.  Really, though, I wish they would have stated the carb count on the ad.

review/text: to explain, the product description lists the item as milk chocolate but it is actually DARK CHOCOLATE!! For some, this can mean the difference in the gift being eaten or sat on a table for months. In my case, the gifted person does not like dark chocolate but the cookies are great looking in appearance. They got here in a reasonable time period, in time for the day in question. The container is a clear plastic and clear side top attached to a white bottom with trim.

review/summary: Tastes Like A Creamsicle In Liquid Form
review/text: I love all of Virgils sodas and the orange cream is just amazing.  It takes me back to my childhood of when I use to drink stewarts creamsicle soda, only virgils is 10 times better and all natural.  Only 160 calories for a 12oz bottle which is not bad for a delicious soda.  There is 42 grams of sugar which is not unusual but if you are watching your sugar intake then be aware that this soda has a lot.  If you still want to try it though they do have a natural diet soda and it is just as wonderful.

review/summary: Great addition to the Orgain flavor family.
review/text: I was eagerly waiting for orgain to put a new flavor out as soon as I heard about it. I've been on orgain for almost 2 years and I couldn't be happier. I switch between the chocolate and vanilla often to mix things up but this iced mocha is a perfect blend. I've long given up coffee for health reasons so this is a close substitute. This doesn't contain any caffeine as mentioned but you can still taste the mocha blend, which is a good thing. I would highly recommend trying this new flavor if you've enjoyed/liked the other variations of orgain!

Pretty disappointing I must say...both my husband and I felt sick to our stomachs after taking only a few sips. It has this bad cream taste. The chocolate flavor is delicious, and the vanilla flavor is pretty decent, but this is just yucky! I only gave it three stars because I love the company and the fact that orgain is such a great product. Stick to the other flavors though!

A small splash of rice vinegar fixed that problem however. I can recommend it for a quick, simple snack. I'll probably buy it again.

review/summary: Love the product, but don't buy online until they learn how to package
review/text: I love, love, love Lee Kum Kee Chili Garlic Sauce. I use it in several dishes, but I especially love to make vegetarian dishes with it. When I lived in the DC area, I could find it at almost any grocery store, but I've moved to an area where local grocers don't carry it, so, I thought I'd buy it online and ordered 4 jars. The GLASS jars were shipped in a bubble envelope with a large fragile label adhered to it. Lee Kum Kee is on the west coast; I'm on the east. Every jar arrived broken. It was an incredible mess.<br /><br />I complained and requested a refund, which I got without a problem, but honestly, I wanted the chili garlic sauce.<br /><br />If you order anything from Lee Kum Kee, make sure they know that you know that packaging must be appropriate to the product shipped. People who ship glass containers of anything should know how to package so that breakage is rare. Lee Kum Kee may save a bit on shipping costs by using bubble envelopes, and maybe some packages make it to their destination intact, but it's a bad business decision. People like me are going to share so that others don't have the same bad experience.<br /><br />If anyone has a recent, better experience please let us know. I do love their products.

review/summary: Greenies Allergy Formula Pill Pockets for Dogs
review/text: I love this product. I have to give my dog medicine on a daily basis and he takes them like treats using pill pockets. I normally buy the capsule (as opposed to tablet) size and just pull off as much as I need to cover the size pill Dexter has to take. This makes the product last longer. Dexter thinks they're a treat and just gobbles it down medicine and all.<br /><br />The one draw back for me is the smell of the Allergy formula pockets - it's pretty bad! I've used the beef flavor in the past and don't remember the smell being so bad. I had to stop using the beef formulas because after finally reading the ingredients I found it had chicken broth/stock in it and my dog is allergic to chicken. Not sure why they put chicken of any kind in a beef version but I've found this in many beef products.

review/summary: My dog can still taste the pills, and spits them out
review/text: My dog had been taking pills without issue for several months.  Due to a recent surgery, her daily pill count has gone up dramatically, and it has become increasingly difficult to get her to take them. I have heard many people saying how wonderfully these pill pockets work, so I finally decided to give them a try.  First, I think they are ridiculously expensive (although reasonable at Amazon, these cost almost 30% more at my local pet store, where I unfortunately bought them).  Second, if the pills taste bad (particularly if they are tablets that are cut in half to lower the dosage), it is likely that your dogs will still spit them out if they are anything like mine.  I was hoping for the magic solution to pill taking, but this is not it.

review/text: Our vet prescribed medication for one of our dogs (a medium sized pill) that she refused to swallow.  We tried the Pill Pockets and night became day.  Our dog now looks forward to taking her medication in the morning and at night.  In fact our other dog thinks she should have one of these "treats" at the same time.  We're able to split the Pill Pocket in half so it only takes one to cover both the morning and evening medications.  The Pill Pockets are moist, can be divided into 2 pieces by hand, and can be molded around the pill to cover sharp edges.  What a great product.

review/summary: These are for dogs!
review/text: I should have realized it from the picture that these pill pockets are for DOGS! I searched "Greenies pill pocket cats" and this popped up. I saw the price and thought, "Hey! That's great" and placed my order. I didn't even notice the mistake until I opened the package and went to pull out a pill pocket and it was huge!<br />  That being said, I think Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome! My cat will eat them without any fuss and I do not have to worry about how I will give him his pills. But before you order, just make sure you're ordering for the type of pet you want to be ordering for!

review/summary: Greenie Pill Pockets are my friend.
review/text: I have a dog with arthritis and hates to take pills. She does not gulp her food, she chews everything. I wrapped the pill in everything to entice her to take it.  It is bitter, not only to the taste but she could  smell it in everything I tried. Braunswager (sp) Vienna Sausage, everything.  I wrap it well in the Greenie Pill Pocket and she eats it right up. I ordered two packages and both contents were in perfect shape.  No crumbs, no pieces, none smashed as I have read in other reviews.  Since the stores that carry these are not in my immediate shopping area, I find it's easier to order from Amazon along with other items I need. I will order again and I have already recommended to a friend and neighbor.

review/summary: Best thing ever!
review/text: My dog suffers from an auto immune disorder which causes him to have to take a lot of meds. He also is on a novel protein diet and can't have many "normal" dog treats or food. After trying a million ways to get those pills in him I found these in the reduced allergen flavor. Yes, they stink horribly. But suddenly meal time is a treat and I couldn't be happier! Just wish more came in a bag and they were cheaper.

review/summary: Wish I'd found these sooner!
review/text: I'd always heard of Pill Pockets and thought they were just stupid. Why pay a lot for treats with a hole in them when you can just wrap some cheese around the pill? Until my dog got so sick she refused to eat anything at all. The vet gave me some of these to try, and she would eat them and the pills inside right away, when she refused to eat anything else.<br /><br />I've also discovered they make great training treats, because you can break off small pieces without dropping crumbs everywhere. I've always had problems with treats that leave crumbs because my dogs spend more time hunting for crumbs than listening to me. Wish I'd started using these years ago!

review/summary: This is a great size for savings!
review/text: I have used well over a dozen of the beef flavored 3.2 oz, tablet size. The Amazon.com Prime supply ran out of the 3.2 size, so I thought I'd go ahead and try these. One of my dog's daily liver supplements are rather large. Still, it fits in a half of one of this size. Just 1/4 will cover his smaller daily meds. I use a knife to cut them, but it's hardly necessary. The pill pockets easily mold around any shape.<br /><br />Even though the prices vary, it's still just a few cents more for this size. Twice as much, for a few pennies! Makes the pill pockets way more affordable for me.<br /><br />My 14 year old dog still takes them, even when he's not feeling very well. Makes pill taking a treat, rather than an upsetting battle.

review/summary: Kinda Dry & Rubbery
review/text: I was hoping this would be as good as the beef & chicken pill pockets but these were dry and rubbery.  I had a hard time getting the pocket to stay wrapped around the pill.  AND it really smells - not too good - although my dog doesn't seem to be turned off by that. (Of course with most dogs - the smellier the better....)  She does appear to like the taste - just wish it wasn't as rubbery as these seem to be.  Maybe it's because of it being `Allergy Formula' and doesn't contain the stuff that keeps it from being dry?  The number of ingredients is a lot less than the beef pockets....

review/summary: Pill Pockets are AOK
review/text: Greenies Pill Pockets are the only way to give my dog his meds.  In one pill pocket we can get the two capsules, powder supplement and a large chewable tablet that he gets in the morning.  He has never spit it out or not taken it.  We use two bags a month so we needed a cheaper source than the local retail stores, we looked on-line and Amazon has the best price. I can buy a six month supply and it doesn't break the bank.  Good product, great price and super quick delivery.

review/text: I picked up a bag of these locally (not on Amazon) for my bf's treat-driven English Setter.  He needed to take pills for a few weeks to clear up a skin condition, but half the time he would spit the pill out.  First time trying the pill pockets and he gobbled it right down.  Never had a problem giving the pills again.  I guess for a dog who is picky about treats it might not work, but for ours it was a perfect solution.  He thought he was getting a delicious treat.

review/summary: No More Hassles
review/text: These make giving your pet medicine as easy as giving them a treat. Most people don't know these can also be used with liquids. My older dog has always been good at taking pills anytime we want her to, but now her medicine is in drop form.  She needs to take 10 drops twice a day.  It is very hard to know if she is really getting what she is intended without the Pill Pockets. Just put the drops in the pocket and pinch it shut. If you are using the Pill Pockets for pills and have a pet that knows all the tricks try this. Put the pill in the pill pocket with one hand and close the pocket with the other. Never touch the pocket with the hand that touched the pills, your pet can tell. Take another pocket or two with nothing in it break it into a couple of pieces and give it to your pet as a treat. Try this treat, treat with pill, and treat again.

review/text: This product is so good that I had to review it.  Summertime means skin problems for my Schnauzers here in South Florida. I do not like choking pills down the dogs, and they don't like it either! Now, everybody is happy.  I also checked this product at Petco and Petsmart-much higher, almost double.  One piece of advice is the beef is a little better on the hands and doesn't feel quite so slimy.  I prefer the beef.  My youngest Schnauzer did figure out the pill part, but that was easy to deal with. Just act like you are going to give another, and they wolf it down. lol

review/summary: Finally...
review/text: I have to admit, I was skeptical of these to begin with.  Our dog is a master of avoiding medication.  We've tried shoving pills down her throat, we've tried squirting liquid medication into her mouth, we've tried hiding pills in her food, we've even tried grinding tablets or opening caplets and mixing the powder with her food.  She's always able to avoid it.  Even when we mix it with her food, she'll refuse to eat for days.<br /><br />These things actually work though.  I highly recommend the smaller size, because the larger size requires a bit of chewing, and so our dog was able to remove one of the pills once.  Even 29/30 is pretty good.  The small ones are perfect though - 60/60 and counting.  Even if the pill is slightly too big, you can just mold the treat around it so it can't be immediately detected.<br /><br />I wish I had found these years ago...

review/summary: Pill Pockets Help Reluctant Pill Takers
review/text: We first encountered these at a vet's office and tried them, but recently I have been buying via Amazon for convenience and price. The capsule ones help get various pills, including fish oil, into our two dogs. They gobble them down. They are very soft and can be reformed around whatever pill(s) you are giving. I did try the chicken and couldn't stand the smell of them myself, although the dogs were happy with either kind. These are a tiny bit greasy, so I always put a napkin down on the counter before inserting pills, and the smell will persist until you wash your hands (or you will continue to be pestered by yours dogs! This has been a great solution to get most pills down without the dog spitting them out.

review/summary: Pill pockets, what a great idea!
review/text: This is the best thing ever for giving meds in pill form to a pet.  Each little "pocket" is the consistency of a soft brownie.  So they are easy to mold around even a large pill.  I have 2 dogs and both take meds with these, no picking them apart, they just swallow them whole!  Both of my dogs are small (20#) so I usually don't even use a whole pocket for their meds, I break one in half and it's plenty to cover the pill.  Great solution and really makes things so much easier when pets are sick and not even wanting to eat.  I will always keep these on hand now.

I don't even need to use the whole treat. I rip off about a third and they are soft so I mold it around the capsule. I then make her work for it by giving a few commands "sit, stay, come, etc" and she does them excitedly. After she gets her treat, she is so excited that she does a lap around the apartment. Overall, these pill pockets are a winner and I will use them as long as she keeps getting pills!

review/text: My little dog is a Japanese Chin. Giving him medicine requires more effort than the building of the Pyramids and years of combat training. Enter the Pill Pocket. These little gems are amazing. If you're dog can smell a pill from a mile away, try these. Sometimes in his morning dose, I have to dip it in gravy (which I buy at KFC every couple weeks and keep in the fridge), but that's the most additional effort I've had to exert since we started with these. Get them, use them, enjoy them. Warning, they're pretty stinky, IMO, so don't spend too much time sniffing them.

review/summary: A life saver...
review/text: I was so relieved when I found this product. Our doberman was having serious skin allergies and had to take antibiotics and steroids in pill form. He was so crafty with the pills - we would hide them in wet dog food, only to find the food eaten and the pills spit out. We hid them in salami, raw meat, pastrami, turkey, soft cheese, hard boiled egg, anything that you could think of that is appetizing to a dog and he would eat the food and spit out the pills. It got so bad that he actually stopped eating and drinking. He was so sick. Our vet put him on IV fluids and steroids and antibiotics and these wreaked havoc on his liver. We were so worried. He was going down the drain. Then I found this product. Simple as that, we put the medicine in the treat and he wolfed it down. He actually got to the point that when the 6 hour time was coming around to "get the treat" he would start whining and staring at the refrigerator where I had prepared the whole dosage plan ahead of time and put them into a plastic box with big lettering, "THIS IS ALEX'S MEDICINE - NOT CHOCOLATE!" We had a close call with my little sister - they looked appetizing to her as well! :) Now I use these for his vitamins and for anything that he has to take that is not appetizing. Really a life saver! I now buy Greenies Pill Pockets in bulk - by the 6 pack.
