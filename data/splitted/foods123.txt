review/text: This is a very good deal. The coffee goes without saying. A perfect cup every time.  I have had a Keurig for a few years now, and to me there is nothing out there that can touch it. A fabulous, fresh cup every time. I never go to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks anymore.<br /><br />The offer is a good one. I bought 5 boxes of 24 for $10.95 each and shipping was free! I saw another review where the guy said this was "high" compared to prices locally. I have yet to find the same deal locally. Supermarkets rob you for 12 pods and Bed, Bath and Beyond gives you 16 or 18 for $9.99 at last check (and it could have gone up) as coffee has gone up. I also used to get the same coffee at the same price a couple of years ago at "CoffeeforLess.com. Their prices have increased dramatically recently. I don't see where there are any better values around online or locally.

review/summary: Perfect cup o'coffee!
review/text: Some people like a strong cup of coffee that kicks them in the mouth first thing in the morning, but I don't, so I tried one classified light roast, which was a little too weak for me. I tried Nantucket Blend, and it is perfect! It's not weak at all and had a really delicious flavor to it, what I think a good cup of coffee should taste like. It is so smooth, not a single negative thing about it except that now I go through it so quickly!<br />This is my favorite one so far, and has become my morning drink every day!<br />If you like coffee and are looking for a not too strong, not too weak blend give this a try!

review/summary: Delicious medium-roast blend with complex tones
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:30 Mins<br /><br /></span>The name belies an intoxicating medium-roast blend that fuses flavors from Central America, Indonesia and East Africa. The Nantucket Blend is deliciously complex - a m&eacute;lange of four coffees from three continents - opening with the aroma of berries, spice and wine and soft floral undertones and finishing smoky and sweet with a touch of French Roast.<br /><br />According to the Green Mountain Coffee website, the blend's origin dates back more than 20 years ago, "created at the request of a loyal customer who lived on Nantucket Island. The blend proved a winner, and the name stuck."<br /><br />I drink Nantucket Blend black, using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. My wife, who will often add creamer to darker roasts, also enjoys this blend black.<br /><br />In summary, this medium-roast blend is a new favorite in our house. We first purchased Nantucket Blend during an Amazon sale for about 55 cents per Keurig cup. Regular price is about 66 cents, 15 cents higher per cup than other brands. Is it worth the additional price? Yes, but keep an eye out for sales.<br /><br />Added bonuses:<br />Nantucket Blend is certified kosher by the Orthodox Union.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is Fair Trade Certified.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is organic.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />BTW: Here's my recent K-cup coffee reviews for Amazon:<br /><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYUE6G">Green Mountain Coffee Lake & Lodge Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003C4YIFE">Green Mountain Coffee Vermont Country Blend</a><br />4 stars: Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread</a>

review/text: We got a box of this along with our Keurig brewer from Costco. We have three coffee drinkers in the house and all of us are fond of strong, dark-roasted coffee.  This blend is underroasted and weak.  The one good point is that it isn't as sour as most cinnamon roasts are.  We ended up throwing out half the box because I couldn't get anybody to drink it.<br /><br />If you're a fan of very mild medium-roasts you'll probably enjoy this.  If you like coffee strong and dark with some body to it you'll hate it.

review/summary: A good price If you cannot buy local
review/text: Buying K-Cups appears to take more math & literacy skills than most people seem to have.  People keep comparing the price of different boxes without accounting for the cup-count.  The trick is to comparison shop the price per-Kcup because the boxes vary from 18 count boxes to 24 count boxes...eight more cups makes a difference.  This a a fair deal in my opinion since you get two 24 count boxes, and it is shipped to your door.

review/summary: Coffee is good - Shipping is 3 months??
review/text: I really like Nantucket Blend.  I drink way too much!  So I thought I would buy the 96 ct. pack.  What a mistake.  I ordered 2 weeks ago, but the product has not arrived.  I checked my Amazon account and it said the product would ship between July and August.  Three to four months for shipping?  How very ridiculous.  I must say that this is my fault.  It clearly says that in the product listing.  However, I usually get everything I order from Amazon.com within a couple or three days, so I didn't even think to look.  Buy this coffee from another vendor, please.

review/summary: Poor coffee , Nothing to do with Nantucket, named wrong
review/text: The Ingredients aren't from Nantucket, the blend is not smooth. Too heavy  or something maybe too much arabica.<br /><br />then today I learn Green Mountain Coffee is involved with this:<br />Burlington, Vermont - October 25, 2010<br /><br />Could a routine inquiry into accounting practices at Green Mountain Coffee Roasters lead to an insider trading investigation? A Wall Street whistleblower believes it's possible after reviewing documents from the Securities Exchange Commission.<br /><br />The SEC is already conducting an informal inquiry into Green Mountain's "revenue recognition practices." And now Sam Antar, a securities expert who has worked with federal investigators, says public documents show a company executive sold thousands of shares just before the company publicly disclosed the SEC inquiry. The announcement of the inquiry was followed by a 16-percent drop in Green Mountain's stock price.<br /><br />A group of shareholders are already suing the company, alleging executives artificially inflated the stock price and cashed in before the price drop. And Antar says the timing of the stock sale is the kind of thing that could trigger an insider trading investigation.<br /><br />Not recommending this at all. Try the Donut Shop Kuerig Coffee its a lot better blend..

review/summary: A very nice, full flavored medium roast coffee
review/text: I prefer deep, dark roasted coffees but many people don't.  My mother used standard household blends such as Folger's for many years.  When she received her Keuring machine she started to experiment with other brands and blends.  She occasionally drinks a flavored coffee but this has become her favorite.  I get her a couple of boxes a month and she loves it.  I have tried it and here is my take on this blend:<br /><br />The body (or "mouth-feel") is light to medium.  The acidity is medium-low so it won't have too much of a bite, especially of you use cream.  The flavor is surprisingly complex with some spice (maybe cardamom or anise and a little pepper) as well as a rich coffee finish.  This will not replace my favorite dark roasts but I will keep it on hand for those guests who find a "Starbucks-type" of coffee too strong or bitter.  If you, like my mother, enjoy a "regular" blend I don't think that it get's better than this.

review/text: The box says it's "one of the most sophisticated blends you'll ever enjoy. Borrowing berry flavors from African beans, a full body from Indonesian beans, and a subtle smokiness from a touch of French Roast, this blend represents a spectacular tapestry of flavors carefully woven together."  It's still a smooth tasting coffee even with all of those descripters.  This coffee actually brings together 4 different coffees from 3 different continents.<br /><br />Actually, this coffee would be for someone who likes a smooth cup of coffee, it's comparable to Folger's medium roast.  You can still add your french vanilla creamer and sweeteners with no problem.  It doesn't cause the coffee to go bitter.  It wouldn't disappoint the avid coffee drinker nor shun the occasional java drinker either. Overall, it's a nice cup of coffee.

review/summary: My favorite coffee K-cup so far
review/text: I first tried this brand and blend as part of a k-cup sampler pack. I was immediately in love with this k-cup! It's my very favorite so far. My personal preference for coffee is a nice bodied medium roast, and this more than fits the bill. It has the smoothest taste of the 6 or 7 medium roasts/breakfast blends that I have tried so far. If you like high octane, this is not going to be your favorite k-cup, but you would certainly enjoy it as a nice change of pace every now and then. My benchmark for a good k-cup is that I can use the large (9oz) setting on my Keurig and still get a cup of real coffee, not coffee flavored water. This passes the test with flying colors. If I need a kick in the pants to get out the door in the morning, I drop down to the 7oz setting for a slightly stronger brew. I like the fact that the taste remains smooth, even if I make it a little stronger. I give this k-cup an A+!

review/summary: The Best in the Pack
review/text: I recently purchased the Keurig B-60 Special Edition Brewer from Amazon.  It came with a sample variety pack of 12 different K-cup blends (note no light blends included).  I tried all of them and found this particular blend to be the best to my liking although I do prefer a light blend.  It has a nice coffee aroma (like one you would smell at a good restaurant but can't produce at home) and surprised me by tasting as good as it smelled.  It is a medium blend and tastes relatively smooth without an excessively strong or acidic aftertaste.  Recommend to fellow Amazon customers that prefer a  medium blend coffee.  I recently found the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend available at my local Walmart and plan to write a review on it.

review/text: I was recently given the top of the line Keurig single cup coffee maker from Costco that came with a lot of different flavors to test out.  This Nantucket blend was easily the best of the bunch.  It truly is a great tasting coffee and I can't believe it comes out of my Keurig.<br /><br />Now I do drink a cup of coffee every day and I'm not fond of the waste that this product produces so I actually have one of these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW">ekobrew Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> and grind my own coffee.  It's cheaper and better for the environment and it's what I use for myself.  However, the fine dust does pass through the filter so I don't like to give it to guests.  I don't mind the dust though that settles at the bottom of the cup and for being much cheaper I don't mind.<br /><br />These cups though I save for my guests so that they can get a great cup of coffee without any of the dust.  And they all love this coffee.

review/summary: Too Weak for Me; Turns White After Adding Cream
review/text: I've had to hunt far and wide to find the right K-cups for me.  Generally, I like coffee people donut shop, and that had been my go to coffee for a while.  The dark bold coffees are way too intense for me, but the mediums are generally way too weak.  Wanting to try something new, I followed the reviews and tried this coffee thinking it would be a good strong but-not-too-strong alternative.<br /><br />It wasn't.  If I use two pods, this is a decent, but weaker, coffee for me to use in my travel cup for the ride into work.  Otherwise, it is much too weak.  I was very surprised that the first time I brewed some and poured in half and half, the coffee turned very light brown.  It was almost white.  I will get through this package, but I will not buy again.  It's not cost effective for me to use two pods to be satisfied.  Any other suggestions?

The Nantucket Blend is deliciously complex - a m&eacute;lange of four coffees from three continents - opening with the aroma of berries, spice and wine and soft floral undertones and finishing smoky and sweet with a touch of French Roast.<br /><br />According to the Green Mountain Coffee website, the blend's origin dates back more than 20 years ago, "created at the request of a loyal customer who lived on Nantucket Island. The blend proved a winner, and the name stuck."<br /><br />I drink Nantucket Blend black, using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. My wife, who will often add creamer to darker roasts, also enjoys this blend black.<br /><br />In summary, this medium-roast blend is a new favorite in our house. We first purchased Nantucket Blend during an Amazon sale for about 55 cents per Keurig cup. Regular price is about 66 cents, 15 cents higher per cup than other brands.

I do like Neuman's Extra Bold, but its not my number one choice.  With this coffee you loose none of your flavor from adding cream.

review/summary: One of the best...
review/text: The name is not very exciting, but don't let that deter you from tyring it. It is a great cup of coffee. It is not overly strong but absolutely not weak. No bitterness and no aftertaste. It has some very subtle flavors that I can't quite identify and that makes it a unique experience. This is one of my "go to" blends and I keep more of it on hand than the other varieties.

review/summary: Great coffee but k-cups are becoming a luxury!
review/text: Coffee is great, delivery was great BUT k-cups are quickly becoming a luxury.<br />Now that many of us know what we like, the price of the k-cups is through the roof.  I know the price of coffee is way up, but at  .62c cup, or $60/month for at-home coffee (about the lowest I've been able to find for k-cups),  this 3-4 cup a day user is likely to be filling her little make-your-own-k-cup device far more often.

review/summary: Nice coffee to start the day
review/text: I enjoy starting the day with a cup of coffee. Once upon a time, I just used instant. Some were decent quality; some weren't. Then, I tried Mr. Coffee. Sorry, not my cuppa! Back to instant. Maxwell House had some nice instant.<br /><br />But my family wanted a Keurig coffee maker, so--for the holidays this year--I bought one. The coffee that came with it was a Newman's Own blend. Pretty bold and tasty (better than instant and quite a bit better than my memory of Mr. Coffee). I recently ordered this through Amazon. It is not quite as bold as the Newman's Own k-cup coffee. But it does have a smooth taste that starts the day off nicely. So, I have encountered two good coffees for the Keurig coffee maker!

review/text: Ordered this product without reading what i was getting ... dumb on my part.<br />My wife loves Nantucket Blend.

review/text: Just got this coffee in the mail today, it arrived early on the estimated delivery date. I am currently drinking a cup and its smooth and goes down easy not really acidic. I use half and half and splenda but I was be good with just cream,milk,half and half etc no sugar or sweetener needed. 48 cups for the price is a little much considering there are places that sell 96 for 51$ also you have to factor in the cost of shipping. If your looking for K-cups in bulk try coffeeforless.com otherwise this is fine.

review/summary: Didn't buy on Amazon but
review/text: Since getting my Keurig machine I have been experimenting with variety of K-cups.  I didn't get this on amazon but caught it on sale at the local market.  It's a good basic cup of coffee.  While trying to figure out flavor preferences (with things like caramel, blueberry, etc.) it's nice to have a basic that you can rely on.  Some of the flavors aren't strong enough and some of the other brands or roasts are way too strong.  Nantucket blend is a happy medium.

I find this strength perfect.  Amazon has the best price and I love the packaging of the 50-count package.  Recycle the one box--very little waste!

review/text: Green Mountain Coffee, Nantucket Blend is my favorite coffee to use in my Keurig Brewer.  However, in this particular box, the coffee did not taste fresh.  Perhaps due to the large quantity in one box, it remained in storage too long.  At any rate, previous orders from other Amazon sellers, like az trading llc and pm trading, and smaller-quantity boxes from Amazon.com LLC were far superior.

I like dark coffee,  my daily drink is Timothy's Midnight Magic Extra Bold.  My wife likes Timothy's Morning Blend and prefers a light roast.  Even she didn't like this coffee and said "it tastes like warm milk".

review/text: I read several of the reviews before signing up for a subscription for this coffee. Usually Amazon customers are spot on, but in this case the reviews didn't help. This coffee is really weak, watery, and bland. Ever tried running water through a K-cup a second time? It's awful and tastes much like this coffee. AND SINCE IT IS A SUBSCRIPTION, IT'S NON RETURNABLE. That's right, I can't return a $30 order. Be sure you like this stuff before signing up or risk getting stuck with some really bad coffee.
