review/summary: Great product at a great price
review/text: I am so happy to find this product.  The oatmeal is great and I'm learning how to make some interesting breakfast and dessert foods with it besides plain old boiled oats.  So far we've done it overnight in the slow-cooker and used it to make baked oatmeal with apples and raisins.  The texure is different but the flavor is outstanding.  We try to stay away from high glycemic foods, but do like some of the more traditional flavors.

review/text: My Amazon order for "Country Choice Organic Irish Steel Cut Oats" came yesterday.  The six containers were packed in a heavy cardboard box which was packed inside a heavy cardboard box.  The round, 30 ounce oat container is still made of thin cardboard which tries to collapse just by picking it up.  For example, I'd say the Quaker container is twice as thick.<br />The oats were fresh and the taste was outstanding.  I will continue to purchase this product from Amazon.

review/text: Chewy, tasty, fabulous.  I love steel cut oats and these are great.  I cook them on delay in my rice cooker so they are ready when I wake up in the morning.  I use the "white rice" setting.  I fill the pot with recommended water and oats, add some cream (YES YES YES) and set the timer to have them ready.  The cream really makes them great.  My girlfriend adds maple syrup--but I try to watch simple sugars like that.  However you take them, these are great.

review/text: This is our favorite breakfast cereal.  It takes a while to cook (approx. 30 minutes) but it is worth the wait.  There is no comparison between this and rolled oats.  This cereal is nutty in texture, flavorful, and very satisfying.  Previously, we had been purchasing McCann's Irish Steel Cut Oatmeal at the local grocery store, but this is just as good, is organic, and when purchased from Amazon, is much less expensive.  My wife and I highly recommend this hot cereal.

review/text: I was really just hoping to find a deal on organic oats for homemade oat-infusions for dry, itchy or irritated skin. And I found it, along with a great tasting, healthy breakfast, and sometimes dinner too! Rolled oats are good but we love the chewiness of the steel cut, even if it does take 30 minutes to cook, and of course it has double the fiber than the rolled so it's great if you're looking to incorporate more fiber in your diet too - there are no complaints at our house!

review/summary: Better Than Rolled Oats
review/text: I switched to steel-cut oats upon learning why they're considered even healthier than rolled oats.  Steel-cut oats, also called Irish oats, are regarded as having a lower glycemic index.  That makes it a slower-burning energy food causing a lower insulin boost.  The oat taste comes out more and not surprisingly is nuttier.  Whole grain foods often have a slight nutty taste.<br /><br />The downside compared to rolled oats is that Country Choice takes longer to prepare.  One way to cut down on cooking time is to pre-soak the oats. Once you get used preparing these oats, you can tell when they're ready by how much they've expanded.<br /><br />Other good features of Country Choice include the fact that it's organic and the incredible value.  You get 6 well-sealed containers.  That's 180 ounces, or 11.25 pounds - a lot for the price.

review/summary: Excellent Oats, Good Value!!!
review/text: We love these oats and like that they are organic, too.  We make them in our Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker on the porridge setting, overnight and have them hot and ready for breakfast, most mornings!  They are so EASY to make this way.  Much easier than other methods we've tried.  The price, on Amazon, is much better than found locally (and we live somewhat near to their place of manufacture).  These are fresh, delicious and just as good or better than McCann's, as well as, much cheaper.  A great way to start the day, especially on cold mornings and good for you, too.  We DO wish there was a bulk packaging form of these available for an even better price and to eliminate all the wasted packaging for us "bulk-size" eaters.  (Or a subscribe and save price break would be the next best thing!)  Great plain with just buttermilk (Irish/Scottish way) or with milk/cream, butter, brown/white/cinnamon sugar or fruit added.

review/text: My wife and I are trying to eat healthy and tasty foods. For many years I didn't eat oatmeal or anything like it. Now, I love Country Choice Organic Irish Steel Cut Oats as a healthy and filling meal. We usually cook enough for several meals since it takes about an hour to boil the oats; however, it's well worth the wait. When you're ready for leftover steel cut oats, just add a little water, then heat & eat.<br /><br />To add some extra flavor to our steel cut oats, we like to mix cinnamon, walnuts, dried berries or raisins, and agave to the finished product. We get a nutritious breakfast and we love the taste!

It does take 30-35 mins to cook, so what i do is make a whole bunch in advance and separate into small glass cups and refregerate them.  then I  heat it up quickly in the morning or even microwave if you want.  I enjoy these and it tastes great, however I probably would get rolled oats if I had to buy it again in bulk.  enjoy the health benefits of this organic kind.  these cost at natural grocery store for 2.99 each or 17.94 a box.

review/summary: Great Price on a Healthy Breakfast
review/text: After much comparison shopping, this is the best price we could find for steel cut oats in our area.  We have tried many brands, and find that they are all virtually identical in taste and texture, so price was the deciding factor for us.<br /><br />We cook this overnight in a small size crockpot, just using the oats and water.  By using a light timer, we limit the cooking time to 6 hours, which makes a perfect batch.  We always add cinnamon and Splenda, but also may add raisins, fresh blueberries, or sliced bananas.  Occasionally, we add Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder with just a smidgen of cinnamon and a 2nd packet of Splenda - a fun chocolaty breakfast.<br /><br />The only complaint we have is that Amazon ships this UPS rather than USPS.  Our experience has been that UPS is careless with packages, and these boxes always arrive beaten-up and partially open.  So far (we have ordered 3 times), we have not had severe damage to the canisters, but it is bound to happen eventually with the treatment they receive from UPS.

review/text: I believe that my keeping this oatmeal as my everyday breakfast helps me to lose/maintain my weight.  I make a batch of it (enough for about a week) and bring it to work.  I add a little honey and brown sugar when it's done.  In the morning, I put a little in a bowl and cover with milk and microwave.  I also add raisins, dried cranberries, granola, strawberries, blueberries or bananas after it's reheated.  The steel cut oats' consistency is different and it took me a while to get used to it.

One cup of oats will give a bit over 3 cups cooked, and will suffice for one persons breakfast for a week (at a � cup of cooked oats).<br />In the morning put the cooked oats in a bowel with whatever you like (nuts, cinnamon, raisins, etc.) and place in the micro wave for about 2 minuets.<br />Add milk, almond milk or whatever and enjoy.

review/text: This is the perfect breakfast: the oats are steel cut, so you still get the fiber and the long lasting energy since it takes longer to break down the groats. But, they're not the whole groat, so it cooks faster. I haven't ever timed it, but I usually cook these in about 10 minutes or so (I always hear people that say to cook them longer, and I have never needed to--maybe I like them a little crunchy??). I also add a little bit of oat bran, and it's a super filling breakfast. I prefer to buy my oats from the bulk bins at the store, but when I can't get to the natural foods store, I buy these. They're super yummy!

When I opened the package, the oats spilled all over because the plastic bag ripped from the excessive bulge .  I had to do a bunch of unnecessary cleanup that could have easily been avoided with proper packaging.  Will not order any more oats unless vendor sends me a complementary package.

review/text: I've been ordering these as part of Amazon's Subscribe-and-save program and haven't been disappointed. I'm a college student and live in a tiny room with no stove or oven, only a microwave and a small fridge. Needless to say I don't cook at home and buy a lot of microwaveable foods for when I can't afford to eat out. When I'm studying or just relaxing in the afternoon and feel like a snack between meals I'll grab one or two of these and enjoy them. I also keep a few in my backpack and car in case I ever feel hunger pangs on the go. I can't attest to how healthy they are but I can say for sure that they satisfy my hunger temporarily. They are a delicious snack and I haven't noticed a bad aftertaste as I have with other products I eat way too often. I'd definitely recommend them.

review/summary: Slim Jims have nothing on X-Sticks
review/text: I selected these Slim Jim sticks to try because the Jack Links X-Sticks Bacon Cheddar flavor I usually buy was out of stock. The Slim Jims have a good flavor, but they are far more greasy, and their casing is tough, like eating wax paper. They are also a bit more "dried out" in consistency. I feel that all the Jack Links sticks I have tried are much better than the Slim Jims. X-Sticks are less dry, far less greasy, and more tender to chew.

review/summary: Great snack for the troops & movie watching
review/text: These taste great, salty and meaty - they hit the spot late at night watching a horror flick or action movie with especially bad acting, but great special effects. Being single sticks in single serve wrapping they also make excellent items to put in your care package to our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. Slim Jims don't melt, go stale or wilt in the heat or at the bottom of a pack out on a march.<br /><br />Granted these things are so not health food - I mean come on... the whole point of junk food or comfort food is that it tastes great and makes you happy. Period. If you're worried about calories or sodium intake, then you need to be shopping for something all together different like lettuce or carrots. Don't slam the Slim Jim for being what it is - we all KNOW what it is... it's a greasy, fatty, salty stick of meat in a little plastic baggie made to be eaten in 3 bites with a cold mug of beer in the other hand and a bag of Fritos as a side dish.

Like all red meat, though, it's not good for you, so eat sparingly. I know meat eating is slowly declining, but here where I live, veganism is not seen. So ignore PETA's cries and take a bite out of this.

review/summary: Great bargain
review/text: Same SlimJim taste I remembered, and I like the little ones because you can stick a handful in a pocket.  Amazon seems to have gotten their act together -- I ordered these and got them two days later.  And as far as whichever reviewer said these are made from cow hair, well, they've got a serious screw loose.

review/text: The quality of the shipment and it's contents was great and on time.  There were no problem with the order.  I can't give it an excellent rating, though, just due to the fact of its contents.  Not that I did ot know that a the time of purchase.  It a grossly proceessed food, which is probably why I like it.  I'm the only one eating them in the houe and they're just about Finished.

review/summary: Better than regular Slim Jim's
review/text: If you like regular Slim Jim's, then you should like the Nacho flavor.  Similar to most of my food reviews, these are great for a low-carb diet.  For low-carbers the only problem is the HEFTY dose of sodium, so drink lotsa water with these.

review/summary: Well Balanced Spice and Taste - 4.5 Stars
review/text: They're not quite as tasty as the regular slim jim, but when you want a little more spice these are what you'll need for your Slim Jim fix.<br /><br />Every once in a while you'll get some that have far too tough a skin, and for that a deduction I give them.  I also wish they were lower in carbs.  They can get rid of those carb fillers and up the price if they need.  That tiny bit of carb filler makes a big difference for those of us watching our carbs, and I would love to see those removed, leaving only the carbs used for flavor.  I can only eat a few in a single day because of those darn fillers.  WAH!

review/summary: Can anyone else confirm this?
review/text: I got a new batch of these tasty sticks and it seems they withered down the skin quite a bit. Even just early this yr, I had to many times spit out the skin because I just couldn't chew it enough to let it go down. I was basically chewing on it enough to get the inner "meat" out of the tough casing. Now, I can barely notice the casing and *everything* goes down much easier. I just had 2 sticks and they were yummy!!

review/text: In May of 2010 I ordered a box of Slim Jims original flavor 100 count .28 oz.<br />I opened one up and took a bite expecting a really tasty snack but as hard as I tried I just couldn't chew it.<br />It was like shoe leather. After 2 minutes of chewing I spit it out. I packed up the box and sent it back.<br />Amazon was kind enough to refund my money.<br />Next time order the Jacks Links Original .5 oz X Sticks and you can't go wrong.<br />Chuck.<br />PS: Thanks to Amazon for there customer care.

review/summary: Never quite sure what it actually is, but it is a unique taste.
review/text: There is a reason that Slim Jim doesn't ever quite say what it is.  It isn't a beef stick.  It isn't jerky.  It is what it is.  I remember eating them when they first came out and wondering what they were.  Now, tasting them again, I remember the question.  There is some kind of meat in there, but it is treated in a lot of different ways.  A Slim Jim is still as greasy as I remember, as well.  The trick is to enjoy them without eating them to excess.  For what they are, they are convenient, tasty, and can be fun.

I ordered 2 items which qualified for free shipping and was quoted and invoiced for free shipping. But when I received this $20. item, I was also charged $10 shipping/handling..  Everyone refused to honor the invoiced quoted price. I was given the option to return it ..for another $10...which now the shipping charges exceeded the cost of the item which if I returned, I no longer had...  Quite a reaming...!!!!

review/text: When I was a kid I ate slim jims all the time.<br /><br />I am glad that they still taste the same.<br />Unfortunately, nowadays they like to change and mess with too many of the things that we grew up with and loved as children.<br /><br />Here's what I used to do (and still do): I get the end real wet until the skin gets to the point that you can slough it off without breaking it. I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it's all gone. Then I grab another and do it all over again!<br /><br />And I don't care how many of these you'll try to eat in a week -- a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time! This is a good buy!<br /><br />I recommend the good ol' slim jim!

review/text: This is the second time I've bought these for my dog. Although they are not dog treats, my dog loves them. She is very special to me, so I get her the best. This is a great price for these slim jims. If I buy them in the store I pay alot more for them. I've tried them also & their very good. They come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time. Just like the ones they sell in the stores. If you buy them one at a time at .25C a piece you pay $25.00 dollars for them. I think this is a great value!!

I guess the "box packer" got hungry and decided to eat a few. not cool.<br /><br />Follow up:  Amazon was great about my complaint about the number!  They sent a new box right away.  thanks! and I would order again.
