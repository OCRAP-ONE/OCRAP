review/text: I use a Keurig coffee maker, because I'm the only one in the house that drinks coffee.  I have ordered several types of K cups and some are more to my taste than others.  My preference runs  to Columbian coffee, for the most part. That is until I tried a cup of  the Tully's Kona blend at a friends house. It is just great!!  Good depth and nice after-taste.  So I ordered a couple of boxes for myself from Amazon.  I was not disappointed.  Great taste, easy to use, and just what I wanted.  Try them, you'll like them.  Sam

It's hard to find inexpensive 100% Kona coffee anywhere, so I usually order the K-Cup blends that are available either on Amazon, or at our local commissary, because I really love the unique flavor and aroma of Kona.<br /><br />I think that Tully's is a quality brand of coffee in general, but the Kona is my favorite.  It's delicious: rich, smooth, nutty, the flavor and aroma make a great start to my day.<br /><br />Definitely recommend!

If you don't mind the cost , then you will be getting a super nice coffee, strong but no after taste or bitterness. again I always do a mug, with one k-cup.. my maker does 6,8 and 10 oz sizes . so I just do a 6 & 8 gives me my mug full.Amazon was still the best place to buy this coffee the last time I checked prices.

When I'm not drinking coffee at work, I go to those fancy coffee places where a single-pour made-to-order cup costs $4-5... I would go as far as to say this is comparable to those. The flavor is smoky and pleasant at all temperatures, and has a very nice finish- not too bitter or acidic. I really like this coffee.

review/summary: WARNING KONA LOVERS
review/text: As all true Kona lovers know Kona is in short demand due to the Berry Boring Beetle on the big island. Several companies and all my local grocrey stores no longer carry it. So I was thrilled when I found Kona on Amazon!  The problem I ran into was one of my sealed boxes of Keurig Kona blend coffee was full of French roast. What a first thing in the morning disappointment. At least my second box was OK which I'm hiding from the rest of the family. This was most likely a Tully's packaging error and they must be running out of stock. So Beware and check your orders right away!

review/summary: Once acquired...This (satisfying!) miso soup might be your new addiction.
review/text: I first picked this off the shelf at a military commissary in Kansas one summer... and I never stopped. The first time you try this stuff, it's like wine or avocados; it's a taste that is certainly acquired, and like nothing else. I have fed it to a friend and to my significant other; few like it the first time, but you find yourself strangely coming back for more until it's a staple in your house, like it is in mine. Kind of reminds me of sushi; first time I tried it, I was like, "this is odd, why do people eat this?", then, I found myself craving it a week later. Haha. Now I love sushi and miso! (By the way, it comes in an envelope with 3 individual packets). Mix it in hot water, to taste. You might like it with more or less water, depending on how salty you like your food. -Experiment with it to your satisfaction, and I guarantee, there is much of that to be had.<br /><br />I usually add all 3 little individual packets (it's low-fat) to a decent-sized cup of hot water, add my favorite vinegar, and let it sit and "cure" for a minute or so, since the little green sea-vegetable flakes (and green onions + tofu squares) need time to rehydrate and turn a little chewy and palatable. I then sip it and fish the sea vegetables out to my heart's content.<br /><br />(I also hear that miso can be generally healthy for you!)<br /><br />If you let it sit, the miso will start to separate from the rest of the soup and you have delightful little clouds of miso particles floating in your bowl, which is sort of entertaining and visually delightful, too. I think of it as cheap, delicious entertainment. But then again, I am easily amused. ;)

review/text: My love affair with miso, the flavorful paste made from fermented soybeans, started when I lived in Tokyo several years ago.  So, since then, being the miso snob that I am, it has been unimaginable to me to try any instant variety.  But I have to say that when I finally did break down and try Kikkoman Instant Tofu Miso Soup, I was amazed to find that it was practically indistinguishable in flavor and consistency from miso soup made from the actual paste.  While I would still choose the actual product whenever time permits, I would now not hesitate to substitute this great product when I am on the run.

review/text: Personally, I'd love a bowl of miso soup any day. I first tried it in a very nice sushi restaurant, and then again in a less-fancy one. A few months later, I discovered that Price Chopper sells these exact packets (they're a bit more expensive there than here on Amazon).<br /><br />Miso soup is hard to describe. I think of it as having a taste that you kind of have to acquire...It took me a few bowls to really get used to it. But once you do, it's great! I suggest this for anyone who's interested in Japanese culture and food.

review/summary: Holds its own against any restaurant miso soup
review/text: This is the best miso soup to be found anywhere; it is fabulous and the flavor is just amazing considering it's an instant soup. You can add a variety of vegetables, chicken pieces, pork, beef or shrimp if you like, and chopped spinach and if you love tofu you can add either the firm or soft variety, I prefer the soft.<br />The soup is comprised of fermented soy beans and comes in red (sweeter) or white (saltier) miso paste and fish stock made from bonito flakes and contains kelp as well. I am going to a local Asian market where I live and make my own miso from scratch but bought more of this as backup just in case mine doesn't turn out. It is a very delicate soup and cannot ever be boiled once the bonito is added as it would collapse and the flaovr would be ruined, so I watched videos on how to prepare it.<br />Many years ago when I was in college in downtown Los Angeles, we would go to little Tokyo for lunch and indulge in the then relatively unknown treat, sushi and have the miso and a wonderful salad of finely chopped cabbage and rice vinegar to start.<br />Now I can buy (and do) sushi freshly prepared at my local supermarket and have instant miso whenever I want and that is my idea of Heaven. Miso has the most delicate flavor imaginable, it is absolutely unique, nothing else tastes remotely like it and it is very healthy for you as well.<br />When I went to a fat farm the main reason we all lost so much weight was because the diet plan at this particular place included having a large cup of hot broth before every meal thus cutting the appetite down considerably. I could really put it away before, just huge gluttonous portions, but after finishing the cup of broth, I could eat what they gave us but no more than that.<br />So whether you want in instant soup like no other or want to incorporate this soup into your diet plan, either way you'll be very happy and remember to experiment by adding whatever you like and making it more of a meal.<br />To paraphrase a quote from Benjamin Franklin (re beer) miso is proof God loves us and wants us to be happy. Enjoy!

review/text: I've purchased several different types of packaged miso soups and this is by far the best one I've tried.  It cooks easily and quickly.  I like to pack several packets for vacations, business trips or camping trips because the soup is so easy to prepare with just a little bit of hot water.  And if you forget a spoon, it's okay - just drink it like broth.<br /><br />Making miso soup "from scratch" is one of the things I've failed miserably at every time I've tried, but with these packets I can save myself time, heartache and money.  It even tastes better than some of the miso soups I've had in restaurants.

review/summary: Fantastic for On the Go
review/text: I am currently have limited access to healthy foods and this soup is amazing, all you need is a hot water kettle and a cup.  I use this along with the Amazing Grass Green Superfood and several other 'health' products to keep a decent meal plan going. They are a little salty for me, I'm not a fan of salt at all though, but beggers can't be choosers here!  Even if you are busy in your everyday life these are a great pick-me-up!

review/summary: tasty, but......
review/text: I found this soup to be tasty, but on the salty side so I added more water to taste.  Tofu in product not impressive, but the spinach is amazing the way it hydrates into spoon size pieces.  The biggest downside is the cost.  Almost $1.45 a cup is spendy for instant soup....Cup a Soup brand (at Amazon) is about $0.30.  And bouillon is about 0.05.  If you are looking for something hot then there are other choices.  Was an interesting experience though.  Seller was great and product received quickly.

And I even grew up in Japan in a Japanese household with a Japanese mother who makes much better miso soup but since my mom doesn't live nearby, this is the perfect substitute for me. Don't tell my mom-she'd be horrified! I gave it 4 stars because I wish there was more tofu in it. Also I only use about 1/3 to 1/2 cup boiling water instead of 2/3 cup.

review/text: I am a HUGE fan of miso soup.  I've tried many of the instant miso soups thanks to my asian market.  Kikkoman's Instant Miso is by far the best soup out there.  It's the closest you can get to the "real" thing without actually making the soup yourself.<br />However, this company is selling it at a ridiculous price!  I've purchase the EXACT same thing at Walmart for $1.99/package (which comes out to $0.67 per packet).  This company is trying to sell them for over $3 per package (or over a $1 per packet!) - not even including shipping.  I'd do my homework and buy elsewhere because this company seems to specialize in rip-offs.

review/text: We really love these crackers.  They taste a lot better than the regular peanut butter crackers.  But when you add shipping costs, they are much more expensive on Amazon than in other stores.  We generally buy a box with 8 individual packs for $2.00.  I bought these thinking that there must be a mistake in the description, and there would be more boxes.  I admit, that was my mistake!  But the packing slip said it was 6 boxes of 8 individual packets.  So there is a disconnect between what is on the site, and what the packing slip says.  My recommendation - check your grocery store before you buy.  Chances are you will get them at a much more reasonable price.

review/text: I was looking for a less expensive alternative to Wellness Core. After doing quite a bit of research, I decided to give Hi-Tek Naturals Grain Free a try. I liked that it's protein-focused, but at the same time not ridiculously high in protein like some foods can be. I liked that the food is sourced and made in the US. (The company answered my email in under 20 minutes when I asked them about it.) I also liked that it has probiotics, and I've been able to tell from past experience that my dogs really seem to do better with foods that have probiotics as opposed to those that don't. Far fewer loose stools and upset stomachs in general. But most of all, I'm pleased that my picky dog actually likes the food. The nuggets are quite small, about the size of peas, which is fine for us but something to keep in mind if your dog likes a bigger nugget.

review/summary: Proven Product for Picky Pekingese
review/text: Hi-Tec Naturals Grain Free Chicken and Sweet Potato Formula has been a real life saver. Finding a dry dog food our three Picky Pekingese would eat wasn't easy.<br /><br />Our Vet suggested we try Grain Free dog food after our two year old male began to have signs of digestive problems. Also, our older female had been licking her feet (most likely allergies from something in her diet).<br /><br />We tried several types of Gluten Free (dry kibble)dog food and my picky eaters wouldn't touch it. They had always been fed a small kibble mixed with a small amout of canned dog food. We also tried chicken and rice (which I prepared for them) of course they liked it.  However, it didn't seem to correct the digestive problem for our little boy.<br /><br />Since we discovered Hi-Tek Naturals, Grain Free, all three of our Pekingese will eat it and are doing fine. They seem to like the taste and will chew<br />the kibble, chewing is better for their teeth anyway.<br /><br />We are former breeders of "Show Pekes" and wish we'd found this produce earlier.<br />Thanks, HI-TEC NATURALS from Bach Choy Pekingese

Both have a strong, deep flavor that pairs well with weekend waffles and other "sweet" goodies.  It's a shame that the price has gone up so much, but it's not the fault of the coffee.  I'll keep drinking this one -- it's one of my simple pleasures and still much more affordable than picking up a cup at the local espresso stand.

review/summary: Good French Roast
review/text: Tully's French Roast is a solid choice and one of my staples.  This is my favorite French Roast currently available in a K-cup.  Maybe someday Peets will come in a K-cup, sigh.  One trick if you find it isn't as rich as you normally get in your favorite bistro, is to make a smaller size portion.

review/text: I'm a big time coffee drinker and I tend to like my coffee strong and Tully's French Roast blend delivers! I'm not going to go into all the details about how it taste like "this or that" because everybody's taste are different. But if you like a strong, not bitter, cup of coffee that will get you going in the morning, then this is for you.

review/summary: Bit stronger than the wife likes.
review/text: We normally get Deidrich's French Roast but it is no longer carried in "Subscribe and Save" so I thought a good alternative would be Tully's French Roast.  It's a wee bit stronger than the wife would ideally like, but it's O.K.  Personally, I like it!  (My real favourite is Tully's Italian Roast.)

review/text: I've recently purchased Tully's French Roast K-Cups from Amazon. Well this is the best coffee no bitter after taste, wonderful smell of coffee brewing, very  easy to make.The French roast is a darker coffee for those who like stronger blends.I'd recommend this to all who purchase K-cups .Only bad thing about this product is it goes to fast ,in other words I drink to much of it. LOL  Buy some and enjoy your cup of coffee today.

review/summary: Good Tulley's product.
review/text: I need to say I absolutely love my Kuerig brewing system. French Roast is one my favorite types of roast. I don't want to sound biased, but anyone who loves a strong aromatic coffee would love this kind. I would recommend it to the coffee enthusiast, but that's just me. This won't be so good for those who don't like a very strong, extra bold coffee. If you are one of those who doesn't like a coffee this strong...this isn't for you unfortunately.

review/summary: Great Tasting and affordable
review/text: Addicted to this brand and found this coffee fresh, bold and unbitter.<br />The delivery was super fast and my only complaint is it came in an unmarked box meaning I felt I had to count. But the count was right on & for the savings I'm not complaining so will order again. This coffee being bold but with no aftertaste is one I never tire of it. Everyone who tries this loves it. I find if I brew a small cup makes excellent iced coffee or warm latte. My coffee maker does have size options so considering cost of lattes my homemade version using liquid stevia/almond milk is money saving plus healthy. I have used both plain/flavored stevia and my coffee flavor stays true. All in all addicted and loving every cup.<br /><br />I am adding to review ordered a few days ago and a super charged delivery this was in original package this time and I am a very satisfied customer. Fresh cup in hand while I write this!

review/text: My husband thought the Keurig coffee maker was just another gadget, only to be used when guests wanted to make their own choice for flavored coffees.  When I purchased a small box of this  extra bold coffee, he said it was the best coffee he has ever had...home or in a restaurant!  I purchased this larger box, and he said, "Why don't we put the Keurig in the kitchen, and put our 12 cup coffee maker away"!  He is now having less cups of coffee...enjoying it much more...and absolutely no waste!

review/summary: Tasty!!
review/text: Realllllly good!, I saw this reviewed on Seattle Coffee Gear's site and being me I thought oo I wonder if its on amazon! sure enough.. They had the whole bean version which I wanted more but but no grinder yet so I bought drip and since I hadn't tried it before I was wondering if it was really good or if it was just meh. This is awesome coffee, the drip grind is really great too and strong! I learned quick that you do not want to use too much now if your big on strong coffee go nuts, I used a cone type filter and used 2 1/2 tablespoons and I didn't really level off much and it was sooo strong but not bitter it was super smooth and it was chocolaty really good, love this coffee plan on buying more :0) if you can't find it on here just go to their website.

The beans were fresh, tasty, had the Jelly Belly logo and splashes of yellow on each bean: just what I expected. This vendor gets top billing in my opinion.
