review/text: I love being able to create my own mixes like pancake and cake. We require gluten free foods and the boxed stuff is very expensive and often has a poor texture. I mix my own using this vanilla powder and keep it in plastic storage containers for quick and easy access. What a difference this quality powder from a trusted company makes in our lives.

review/summary: Package wasn't received, and both UPS and Amazon said it was the other's problem
review/text: I have given my dogs these dental treats before and they are very popular with them. The package I found on Amazon was a good price for the large quantity ordered. Since now I have paid the money and never received the item, and basically have found no direct route of getting refunded, I am not happy. I will be reluctant to purchase from Amazon again because there was no way for me to get hold of them for a reimbursement. I contacted UPS and they said Amazon likes to handle these things directly. And from looking all through Amazon's website, it says to contact UPS directly. And when I try to put in for a refund, the product not arriving is never an option---and there is no phone number or way to email otherwise. I guess I am out $30 for this purchase. I am disappointed in both Amazon and UPS for their service. I think if the product arrived, I would have likely been happy with it.

review/summary: SmokeHouse USA?!?  Don't Think So...
review/text: I guess if you want to keep raking in the money you have to fudge and mislead folk.  That's what SmokeHouse has done by adding 'USA' to their name.  I can say this without fear because the packages I have sitting on the kitchen table in front of me clearly say that this is a "Product of China."<br /><br />You know, the China where they feel free to add melamine to products for human babies (2008), and dogs and cats (2007 and 2010) -- all so that the protein levels register higher than they normally would :(<br /><br />I am so disappointed.  Honestly, my little Jack-a-Bee puppy loves their products, but I won't be purchasing the Chicken Chips or Chicken Breast Strips again.  I can't imagine telling my children that the lively little pup they love was made sick (or died!) because of some cheap-*** short-cut.<br /><br />I'd rather pay more money and have it manufactured here in the States.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/dog lover

review/summary: Terrible product
review/text: I bought these chicken treats after receiving several articles about dogs getting sick from other chicken breast treats that we're made in China.  I bought these specifically because they were made in the USA and I assumed they would be safe.  They were so hard I could barely break them and my dog wasn't chewing them well.  He started choking on a piece while eating it and that was the end of that.  These are terrible and dangerous.  The pieces are so sharp I became concerned about him cutting an intestine or something.  Now I make my own chicken treats.  It's pretty easy and I know exactly what is in them.

review/summary: Made In America, with a STRING going through them
review/text: I bought these because they are made in America and my dogs are worth it.  What I don't like about them is that there is a thick string, or maybe just a thick vain of some kind, going through each piece. A much smaller issues is that these are very hard, even hard to break by hand.  We have been using a pliers to break the pieces up before serving and then a scissors to cut the string part!  A dog could choke to death with these.<br /><br />My biggest problem is that I am looking for an alternative USA raised chicken solution for treats.

review/summary: Made in USA or not?
review/text: Have been buying this product for some time now - saw complaints about made in USA or not so I called the company. I spent about 30 minutes on the phone with a woman there who was weary of this complaint but very nice. I told her we love our pets, have learned to trust almost no one anymore and they were hurting themselves by selling products from China.<br /><br />As she explained,the confusion comes from the following: the "Made in USA" labeled chicken breast strips - what I have been using for my golden retriever puppy (who ABSOLUTELY loves them - really a healthy nutritious chew toy that lasts about 3 minutes - maybe 10 minutes for a little dog - when he sees it, he goes nuts - has never choked on them or had any negative effects I can see) is, as it says on the bag, Made in USA - they are processed in the USA and come from chicken raised in the USA.<br /><br />Smokehouse DOES sell another chicken product that does NOT say made in the USA on the package and this product DOES come from China.<br /><br />Buy whichever one you want.<br /><br />As to the complaints about not being able to cut them up easily - this IS absolutely true - so, if you want tiny bits of treat to use for reward based training, this is definitely NOT the product you want. I use other natural treats for this purpose (Merricks lamb lung is terrific for this use and my dog loves this product just as well - a one pound bag goes a long way - very easy to break up in whatever sizes you want in seconds)<br /><br />Finally, this product (chicken breast strips) has ONE ingredient: chicken. It is made in the USA from chicken grown in the USA. Because it is dried, it lasts forever, does not need refrigeration, makes no mess when fed to your dog, dogs love it - what else do you want for a treat?

review/summary: Exciting and wholesome.
review/text: If your dog is the kind with a cast iron gut who chows down on road kill with nary a problem and you have an extremely limited budget, this may not be the treat for your dog. For my own case, I have a Border Collie with a sensitive stomach and my budget for dog treats is modest. These are a great treat made here in the USA as the previous reviewer noted, avoiding the potential problems of Chinese made goods making the news recently. Feeding one of these 2-3 times per week gets that excited, eyes bugging out, reaction one would expect from a treat while providing an all natural, high protein component to your dogs diet, while remaining very affordable. As with any treat, overindulgence can upset the proper balance of your dogs diet, but even 2-3 in one day have not upset my dogs gut. In my opinion, this is almost as good as cooking for your dog yourself.

review/text: We're very happy with the Smokehouse products we've ordered. The quality is top-notch. The Natural Chicken Breast Strips are our dog's favorite. He devours them. He gets a little gassy, sometimes, from them but overall he responds well to the treats.<br /><br />Warning: Not all Smokehouse products are made in the USA. We've found that they are clearly labeled. Generally, if they do not say USA in their main product description you can assume they come from China. We have made the mistake of ordering products made in China, and found that to be our mistake and not the manufacturer's.<br /><br />We have no affiliation with the company.

They call it chicken so that we, the consumers are happy to buy them because we eat chicken too, but what if they said they came from some other kind of avian source?  Anyways, I digress.  My dogs love these, they have no digestion issues from them whatsoever.  I would only feed them, at most, 1 per day.  It is a good value to buy them in the big bag, the smaller bags cost more at my local pet store.

review/summary: Treat caused ulcers in my dog's GI tract
review/text: I should have known when I touched these strips.<br />They are rock solid hard.<br />Anyways I gave it to my dog for the first time, and it caused minor tearing and ulcers in her GI tract. I first noticed little blood in her stool, and dog was visibly unwell.<br />I brought her to the vet immediately before they closed for the day, and did xrays, stool test, and all that.<br />Ended up with a $1600 vet bill, but at least a recovering dog that shouldn't have any long term health problems.<br />The treat basically was so hard the sharp edges was causing minor tearing the GI tract. My dog is a chewer too and she never swallows anything whole, and I was watching her as she ate.<br />I had given her bully sticks, raw hide before (about once or twice a week), and she had no problems.<br />It couldn't have been anything else either because she hasn't eaten anything else other than her dog food (Ziwipeak) in the past 3 days. Ziwipeak isn't a kibble diet either. It is jerky like meat which is very soft. No signs of anything else (like plastic or metal toys, etc) on her x-ray either. So yes, it is these Chickenstrips.<br /><br />Anyhow, I took a new one out of the packaging, and attempted to cut it with a pair of scissors.<br />The strip was so hard my scissors wouldn't cut through, especially where the vein/tendon/muscle fiber (or whatever that is) is.<br />I probably will need a penknife or a small saw to do the job.<br /><br />So yea I learned my lesson, and should have listened to what another reviewer said earlier.<br />I took my chances because this product had so many 5 star feedback, and I made my dog go through unnecessary and avoidable pains and hardship. And also landed myself with a $1600 vet bill (sigh...)<br /><br />Definitely wouldn't advice this to anyone. If you have a really big dog like a Mastiff or a Pit Bull, I can see how this is probably OK because the dog itself is big, so this treat is really small compared in size. I have a 10 pound dog, so yea. I still wouldn't recommend anyone risking any chances, well unless you think a few thousand dollars in vet bills is nothing and don't mind your dog going through all that pain.<br />From now on if I am giving any chicken treats, its gonna be freezed dried or I will just boil or steam some boneless chicken myself.<br />Lesson learned. An expensive, painful, and totally avoidable one.<br /><br />I am so regretful for what I have done to my dog -_-

review/text: Apparently my yorkie is addicted to these dog treats. She's a very picky little dog. If one of these treats was near she would literally turn her head when offered anything else. If offered again, she would back away and wait until this treat was offered instead. We've worked through that, but she is still controlled by these treats. She will do anything and perform any command as if her life depended on it if she can only have these treats!<br /><br />The positives: She really loves them, above all other treats. They're made in the USA.<br /><br />The negative: I think they're too pricey for dog treats.<br /><br />I'm thinking of using the food dehydrator to whip up some chicken jerky instead. Perhaps she will like that as much. Until then, this is the treat of choice.

review/summary: The Most Versatile Hot Sauce
review/text: It's very easy to make a hot sauce and almost everyone does. (There's a store in New Orleans that offers over 200 brands.) What's hard is to make a sauce that has some flavor and some sensation other than pure heat.<br />Sriracha is a medium hot sauce with a fine fruity aftertaste and the substantial undertone of red pepper itself.<br />You'll find yourself adding small quanities of it to unlikely things like consomme, pancake batter and chocolate pudding where its very diluted heat will still carry the other flavor notes through and add a touch of complexity to dishes that are otherwise dominated by a single flavor or squished by an overwhelming texture.<br />By the way, the trick to using hot sauce as an undertone is it add it to half of the product until you can taste it, then add the reserved half of the product back to the pot.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman author of New Short Course in Wine,Theand the very spicy bang BANG: A Novel

review/summary: Great Flavor and Heat - Highly Recommended!
review/text: Huy Fong "Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce" is offered in just about every Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in my area, and with good reason! Unlike at lot of hot sauces, this has a great chili pepper and garlic flavor that compliments most of the dishes I like (particularly good on Pork Lo-Mein) and also provides a good amount of spicy heat. This is not the hottest of the hot sauces but it is on the borderline for several of my friend.<br /><br />This is really good stuff and we almost always keep a bottle of it on hand to liven up or cooking or when take-out doesn't have enough "zing". It is also great to spread on chicken when grilling but watch the smoke when opening the grill lid, it is like OC spray if it gets into your eyes.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: There's DEFINITELY Something Cheesy About THIS Product!
review/text: It started when my niece was five years old and the only way she would eat her sweet potatoes was with "shaky cheese" on them.  That's all she would eat whenever she was out with the family - sweet potatoes with THIS shaky cheese on them.  Every extended-family meal, this container was on the table.<br /><br />Fast forward ten years and MY five year old is sitting with his fifteen year old cousin...he doesn't want to eat cauliflower (although he loves broccoli, huh)...she reaches over, with cheese can in hand, and shakes the orange powder onto the previously snow white vegetables...<br /><br />and he loves it!<br /><br />From that day forward there's been at least one can, if not two or three cans, in our refrigerator. We use it on vegetables, on onion rings, eggs, macaroni/pasta, pizza, and anything else he can think of.  So, as you can see, losing the availability of this product was pretty traumatic for him!  I searched all over the area and finally found two cans, so I GRABBED them!  LOL!<br /><br />When those cans were gone (about three months later), I could find no more! I ended-up buying boxes of mac & cheese  - just for the cheese! You can imagine how THRILLED I was to find the cheese here on Amazon. On AMAZON!  Go figure!<br /><br />I don't care, I would've bought the cheese from the little boy down the street - that's how much my son LOVES this cheese - and if HE loves it, so do I!

I love to make mac n cheese according to the instructions and then sprinkle some more on the top.  I read other reviews and some said they put it on top of veggies etc., I haven't tried that yet but I'm sure it's good.  I think it would work really well on popcorn too.  The possibilities are endless and this price is phenominal.

review/summary: This Stuff is Great!
review/text: Kraft's Macaroni and Cheese Cheese Topping is great! We recently had a movie-themed birthday party for my co-worker, and I ordered this to give to the birthday girl and as part of workplace birthday decorations. I put these cans inside empty popcorn boxes with other small gifts for some people who attended the birthday party. Besides topping this on popcorn, which was perfect for all the popcorn my co-worker received, you can sprinkle this on many other food items. Since I can't eat popcorn anymore because of TMJ/jaw problems, I sprinkle this on pasta dishes, baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, soups, eggs, soft bread, etc. The cheese topping tastes great, and adds some flavor to your food. Like other people have said, you must refrigerate this after first use. The life of these cheese toppings is pretty good - the expiration date is about eight months past the month I ordered and received this product. This can has 25 calories for the serving size, and has 11% sodium, 2% fat, 1% total carbohydrates, 1% cholesterol, and 4% calcium. The ingredients are: whey, milkfat, milk protein concentrate, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, less than 2% citric acid, sodium phosphate, lactic acid, milk, calcium phosphate, yellow 5, yellow 6, cheese culture, and enzymes. Is it worth it to order this product? I would say "yes". It's hard to find this product in some stores. And the price on Amazon is reasonable when you consider that you are getting six cans per order. I give a thumbs up to this Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Cheese Topping!

review/summary: I Can Barely Taste It
review/text: I was really excited to try this given all the glowing reviews.  But honestly, I can barely taste it.  I have to liberally apply it and still it isn't even close to as yummy as I had expected.  For example, for putting on Broccoli, it doesn't come close to beating shaking on Parmesan Cheese.  Comparing it to Cheddar flavored popcorn from Popcornopolis, it isn't even close.  With popcorn, the problem is perhaps getting it to stick, so try spray butter or something to give it something to stick to.  So maybe with level expectations, it can still be good.  It certainly isn't bad.  But I've let it sit in my cupboard for a long time without using it now.  It was a let down for me.<br /><br />One nice thing is that it seems more natural cheese flavor than some other cheese flavoring shakers, such as Kernel Season's Popcorn Seasoning.  The alternative probably is because others might add salt, so they have more flavor, but taste more artificial.  So this does seem the more pure cheese route.

It is good on popcorn, or I have even sprinkled it on leftover pasta for a really quick meal and it was decent. Note, though, that there is a label on it saying that it should be kept in the fridge after opening! (I didn't realize that at first; not that you would get sick-- probably just preserves it better). This product is overall very enjoyable!

review/text: I can't find this in the grocery stores around here, so I was thrilled to see that I could get it through Amazon.  (All they carry is Parmesan.) I use it in biscuit dough, put it into tuna fish sandwiches for a little flavor, sprinkle it onto pie dough scraps, mix it into mashed potatoes - lots of things other than macaroni and cheese!

review/text: I tasted wonderful cheese popcorn at the Palmer House in Chicago and thought this might be the same when sprinkled on hot buttered popcorn. Sorry I had to purchase six as I can't even give them away. Absolutely no taste whatsoever, even when you use a massive amount of it on popcorn. Don't waste your money.

review/summary: Not the Same Cheese Topping as the Blue Box Mac and Cheese
review/text: This is not the same cheese powder that is in the Blue Box Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.  The color is different and the texture is a much finer powder.  Also, the taste is not as cheesy.  If you make your own mac and cheese, it will not taste like the Blue Box Kraft Mac and Cheese.  The package states it is for shaking on popcorn.  I have tried many store brand mac and cheese dinners and none taste as good as Blue Box Kraft Mac and Cheese.

review/summary: Ham Base Goodness
review/text: I did not purchase product from vendor listed I went to soupsonline website and ordered individual one.  I really like to make homemade ham and bean soup and to me this base gives my soup that extra something in flavor that is needed.<br />We like Great Northern beans but Navy beans work too or any kind of bean you prefer.<br />Measure out 2 cups and sort out bad beans or rocks then soak over night.<br />Next day throw out old water put beans in a crock pot on high with enough ham base broth (follow directions on jar) to cover about 1" above the beans.<br />Add in cut up carrots, potatoes, celery and onions...if you don't like any of those veggies you can leave out any or all.<br />I add a nice meaty ham hock because the meat is softer but be warned it's a fattier part of the pig and cook until about 1 or so hours before done then take out the leg and shred meat from the bone and remove any fat and place back into pot. You can also use plain ham bits.<br />I think it takes about 8 hrs or so to cook ie beans are nice and soft and so are the other veggies.<br />This tastes good on the first day but makes even better leftovers as beans breakdown thicken even more and flavors meld<br /><br />The very best thing about this recipe is that if you want your soup thinner add more water or ham base broth if you like your soup thicker start with amount I suggested.<br />I make this soup often in the winter because it has stick to your bone goodness.<br /><br />This can also be used to help flavor green beans...

review/summary: Good alternative if you can't take milk, soy, nuts, etc
review/text: I have two kids with food allergies so I am very limited to what I can use in the house. Between two of them, we can't have milk, eggs, soy, wheat, nuts, and corn. So what is left?? only rice milk (well, I tried oat, sunflower, hemp, etc but I could not get used to the taste). I usually buy rice milk from refridgerated section at the supermarket. I needed poweder milk to use for baking and to mix with my coffee. When you mix this powder with any liquid, it does not disolve well and you have to mix it very well. I usually have to use a back of spoon against a cup and stir multiple times. Other than that, the task is good (well it is not like MILK, as you know) and it does give choices to people with food allergies. So, I really appreciated that they came up with this product. If you can take regular milk, you might want to stick with milk. But if you have food allergies, this is a good alernative product to purchase.

review/summary: Everlasting treat ball
review/text: There is a definate reason these everlasting treat balls are always sold out of the big local pet food stores- they are fantastic! My dog is a very rough chewer- he can even rip apart kongs, and he loves these treat balls. They don't last him for "hours" per say as the package states, but enough time that I am able to have him busy when we have company over. It's especially helpful if you insert a treat ball in both ends of the blue ball, making it especially challenging to pop out the edible discs. Not for an everyday treat obviously, due to quantity and prices, but I will definately buy them again!

review/summary: Not Everlasting, but Not Bad!
review/text: First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really "everlasting" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a><br /><br />Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: These are pretty neutral smelling, which is a plus for this line. I know dogs are all about the smell of things and the stinkier something is, the more they like them...but when you have to share the household with a dog, you need to find a happy medium. This is ours when company comes over. It has no real smell, but they aren't her favorite either.

review/summary: Vanilla Mint is a hit!
review/text: I bought a 2-pack of the liver flavored Everlasting Treats to see if my husky/g.shepherd puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting. That wasn't very "everlasting" and at nearly $4/ea it was an expensive treat. The 2nd one she took 2 - 3 days to eat, so I decided I would buy more of them as an occasional treat. My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (BBQ and Vanilla Mint). I put a Liver and a Vanilla Mint in the treat ball and she went LOVED the VM. It took effort this time to enjoy it, and she worked on it for over a week until there was nothing left but a disk of the treat in the treat ball (so I removed it, gave it to her, and put a new treat in the ball). The ball definitely helped a lot in slowing down the consumption time of the treat and she enjoys playing with it.<br /><br />Two paws up!

review/summary: Great Toy!
review/text: I was looking for something that would keep my dog busy, but also wasn't food that he would just eat and be done with.  This treat, combined with the Everlasting Treat Ball is such a great solution.  My dog (about 60 lbs, Dalmation) has so much fun trying to get this out of the ball, and he seems to love the taste of the Vanilla Mint more than any others.  This takes him a while to eat, but also isn't a lot of food.  it's a pretty decent sized treat.  When I first got it, it took him a while to get the treat all the way out, even days!  Now he can do it in an hour so so, but I still think it's a great buy.<br /><br />Just make sure to get the right size for your dog! Too small and they will rip it apart.

review/summary: All four dogs love these
review/text: I'd have suspected that the vanilla mint wouldn't be the favorite between our four dogs, but it is!  These treats fit into a variety of the everlasting treat balls.  We have the large blue one that takes two 'dog hockey pucks' and two orange ones that take one each.  These are about the density of bone, and are made of not particularly nutritious stuff but are excellent for cleaning teeth and  giving the jaws a workout.<br /><br />We have a very old, very big malamute, another pretty old pointer, a big...err...we're not sure what he is exactly, part rotty, part small bear, part cat...and a black lab puppy.  Everyone loves the everlasting treats, but this is definitely the favorite followed by the barbecue/smoke one.  The malamute isn't much for chew toys, but he absolutely mauls this like he was 12 years younger.  Everyones teeth look considerably better after a few weeks of these treats.

review/text: I have two golden retrievers one is 10 mos old the other is 8 mos old.  Every now and then I need to actually get things done, and with two goldens its quite a challenge.  I like to give them their everlasting treat ball filled with the vanilla mint treat.  It keeps them quite and busy for about an hour.  The treats can be a little difficult to get into the ball and first, but the more you use it the easier it is.  It seems like the big box pet stores and also my local supermarket do not carry these in size large.  They only seems to stock small and mediums.  Very convenient ordering through Amazon.  If you need a little time, these work great to keep the pups occupied and they have nice breath too!<br /><br />Cheryl

review/summary: "Everlasting" is not quite a good description
review/text: I have two Australian Shepherds and they love this product.  I put one in each treat ball and then fill with the small treats.  They get the treats out quickly and then start on the everlasting treat.  If by "everlasting" they mean one day, then ok.  They are agressive chewers, but I was hoping that these treats would last at least a week.  They do love the flavors and there is peace a quiet (except for the loud chewing)for one evening, anyway.  We also end up wasting the last bit of the treat as it is under the lip of the ball and they cannot get at it.  All in all, I will continue to buy this product as a special treat for them from Amazon as the cost is less than at PetSmart.

review/summary: Great food for your pet...
review/text: I have been buying this through Amazon for some time now for my cat. I had been buying the 7 pound bag, but decided to purchase this 15 pound bag to save a little money. I have previously reviewed the 7 pound size here on Amazon. My cat still loves this stuff so I am still happy with the quality of this food.<br /><br />One gripe that I do have is with the shipping of my order, not the product itself, so I am still rating it 5 stars. Although my order arrived quickly for which I am grateful, the order was shipped via FedEx ground with "no signature required." I live in NYC, and leaving a box unattended on my building's stoop right off of a public sidewalk is a poor idea. You might as well write "steal me" in big red letters on the box. Luckily I was home at the time of delivery.

review/summary: Quality Cat Food
review/text: This food has a high protein content with less grain than most cat foods.  It is healthier for my cats and great for the entire household as a better food means their droppings are not as stinky nor as frequent.  My cats love chicken and loved the taste of this food.  They free-feed and I did not have to fill the bowl as frequently either as a smaller amount left them more satisfied than with lower quality food.

review/summary: Good results
review/text: I have been ordering Blue Buffalo for many months now and they always have been on time and the packaging has been done to keep the cat food fresh and the bags intact.  It is a great way to get the food and saves time and money doing the ordering this way instead of going to the pet store.
