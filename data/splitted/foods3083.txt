review/summary: Save Money & Get great Coffee
review/text: This coffee is exactly what you would get at a coffee shop. Sweet and aromatic, not bitter or too bold. I like the pack of 50 and it comes in one box, so there is no waste of packaging or more trash to throw away. If they only made a box of with 100... We love the K-Cups and get great consistent coffee every day without wasting half a pot. My favs are Timothy's German Chocolate (desert coffee!), Donut Shop (mid Morning) and Emeril's Big Bold Easy (first thing in the morning!).

review/summary: Quality control needed ASAP!
review/text: Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control.  I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each.  In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in.  Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.  I hope the folk at Coffee People can rectify this situation, as this is my favorite coffee, but I will not order this product again without some resolve on their side.

review/text: I have been searching for a quick and easy to make oolong tea that is comparable to that of my favorite local Chinese restaurant.  This is it!!  This tea is fabulous because I can take it on the go or enjoy it in a relaxing atmosphere.  It is darker than the typical oolong, but don't let that turn you away.  I appreciate the robust flavor to the last drop and find myself making my way back into the kitchen for another cup.  I had been looking for this tea for many years.  I used to drink this very tea as a child but my local supermarket stopped carrying it and I could not find it so I figured Bigelow had stopped making it.  I did some research and found out that I can buy it here at Amazon and that makes me a happy panda!!!

review/summary: Bigelow Chinese Oolong Tea
review/text: is my favorite tea.  The bags are individually packaged so they travel well.  This is one of the stronger Oolong teas and may take some getting used to.  Once your tastebuds adapt, you may not want to drink any other tea.  I have tried many of the other so-called "best" Oolong teas and Oolongs promoted by "experts."  I always come back to Bigelow.<br />My corner store has been sold twice over the past 7 years.  The company that owns it now quit stocking the Oolong, so I am very happy that I can still purchase it through Amazon!

review/summary: Bigelow Oolong Tea
review/text: This tea's flavor was better than I expected.  Slightly-strong, earthy flavor is a nice twist to those teas which barely zest the water.  I purchased enough boxes to negate shipping.  The result, one of the best Oolong teas I've tasted at about $.50 cheaper than I can find it in the store.  Having nearly ten-times the flavenoids as regular green tea, with its great taste, it the logical choice.

review/summary: Very good for the price
review/text: I have tried 4 different kinds of oolongs, and found this tea to have a very rich, woodsy taste. It brews a dark red/brown color in comparison to some other lighter oolongs, which brew golden. Although it tastes quite strong, which I like, it lacks the sweet aromatic flavors that I love in a previous oolong I've tasted. Those tend to be much more expensive, so I settled for this one. It tastes pretty good & seems good quality for the price. I'm pretty much addicted to oolong tea, so I needed something that I could buy at a good price & still enjoy.

review/text: This Bigelow Chinese Oolong tea is so good! It's darker than the Oolong teas that they serve at your favorite chinese restaurants and in my opinion way better tasting! I've always loved this tea and this is my first time to try the Bigelow Chinese Oolong and I was so delighted. It is delicious and is my new favorite tea! I was introduced to Bigelow teas a few years back and my favorites include their English Breakfast, English Teatime, Earl Grey and Darjeeling teas. I always wanted to try their Chinese Oolong but it's not available in my area so I decided to order online and I was not disappointed. Great tea! Bigelow makes some of the best tasting teas around and what's even better is that you are buying american-made teas. They are grown right here in the U.S.

review/summary: Energy Throughout the Day
review/text: I started buying Chinese Oolong Tea after reading that it increases the metabolism by 10% which is much higher than the green tea I had been drinking. I've read green tea only increases the metab by 4%. I'd have to drink almost 5 cups of green tea to get the benefits of drinking only 2 cups of Oolong. Green tea has been my good buddy since 1998 when my sister introduced me to it, but I have to say goodbye. Oolong tastes better than green tea as well (at least the Bigelow brand does anyway).<br /><br />Being over 40 I was looking for something natural to increase my metabolism without downing extra caffeine. Although Oolong has caffeine in it, it doesn't have as much as coffee. Oolong doesn't give me heart palpitations like coffee does.<br /><br />I start my morning off with this tea and it keeps me from taking a nap or becoming sleepy around 1 or 2 p.m. as I usually do. As a matter of fact, if I'm looking forward to relaxing and curling up for a good nap, I have to remember not to drink any oolong.<br /><br />Bigelow is by far the best tasting Oolong I've had. I have an organic brand that I regret buying as it tastes horrible. I couldn't even finish one cup of that stuff. I'd give Oolong by Bigelow more than 5 stars if I could. I recommend it over coffee and for those of us who need more energy throughout the day. It is definitely more healthy than drinking these energy drinks as well.<br /><br />I find Bigelow Oolong at my local grocer. I go through the stuff so fast, I don't want to wait for mail delivery.

review/text: Been getting this tea as a subscription for about 2 years and love it. I think this is one of the best Oolong teas out there and I've tried many including ones that were several times the cost per ounce. Being in individually wrapped teabag form it is convenient to use and carry when traveling and brews to a wonderful rich flavor that never seems to get bitter no matter how long the bag sits in the water. It does seem to brew much darker than other oolongs but who cares it's the flavor that I love.

review/summary: Bigelow - more flavorful than the other Oolong bag teas
review/text: I have tried numerous brands of packet Oolong tea, such as Twining, Choice Organic, etc. but each time I have been disappointed by the flavor. I recently realized that even though my grocery store doesn't carry Bigelow... well, the internet does! I was curious to see whether I was remembering the tea properly (if it was as good as I remembered), and I'm happy to report that yes, it IS better. This brand of Oolong is by far more the most flavorful of the ones I have tried, and it does not become bitter easily - you have to brew it a long time for that to happen. It's nice to drink something that actually tastes like tea, rather than hot water. :-) Anyway, feel free to try the others as well, but I think you'll find that this brand brews with a superior taste.

review/summary: Bigelow Chinese Oolong Tea
review/text: This is the best Chinese Oolong Tea on the market.  It makes a very delicious hot tea and especially a cold iced tea which is healthy to drink.  For some reason this product is not sold in regular grocery stores.  Only 1 health food store here in Boise sells it and quite often they are sold out of it.  So I was very happy to find that Amazon carried this product and when I buy more than 1 case I do not have to pay any shipping costs and it will keep on the shelf for several months.  SO I plan to purchase 3 cases at a time in the future.  I recommend this to anyone who like Oolong tea.  I have tried other brands but none are as good as Bigelow.  I have always been very pleased with Bigelow Herb Teas.

review/text: This review is specific to the Bigelow Chinese Oolong Tea<br /><br />After drinking this tea several times from whole leaves, I admit I made a mistake in purchasing it as tea bags...even if the product comes in individual packed tea bags and under the Bigelow brand.  The Wulong/Oolong whole leaf tea is an aromatic, delightful tea - golden in colour and has a wonderful taste that does not require sweetening.  The tea bags are nothing like it.  It smells like regular tea (like a Lipton, or any other generic), the colour is dark and the flavor nothing special; even after sweetening with honey or sugar it does not improve.<br /><br />If you want to experience the delight of drinking Oolong tea, do not get it like this.  Get it as whole leaves.<br /><br />I will continue drinking this (120 bags @ $16) but I won't enjoy it but winter is coming, I'll have reason to drink tea...or find someone who likes this and give it to them.

review/summary: Bigelow Chinese Oolong - very nice tea!
review/text: I prefer loose-leaf oolong tea, but for a quick hot cup while traveling or just being too lazy to deal with a loose-leaf strainer, Bigelow's Chinese Oolong tea makes a satisfying cup of tea.  The seeping may seem dark, but the flavor is very smooth and doesn't leave the sometimes "grainy" residue feel of particles in the back of the throat like what some other teas do.  The tea doesn't quite taste like what traditional mom & pop Chinese restaurants serve, but it still satisfies the taste buds if you want a nice hot cup of tea.

review/summary: This is an excellent tea.
review/text: We are both big tea drinkers.  This is is of the better teas we have tried.  Very flavorful not bitter at all.  I did not think it reminded me of the chinese tea of my childhood.  My wife did.  My wife pointed it that we use high quality reverse osmosis water, while the chinese restaurants use sink water.  On that basis alone, it wouldn't taste the same.<br /><br />Verdict  by both of us.  An excellent mild, but well flavored tea, with no bitter aftertaste.<br />This and Bigelow's unflavored morning blends are now my favorite teas.

review/text: I was happy to find this Oolong at Amazon because I can no longer find it at my local grocer's. It may be a little different from other oolongs but I like it's deep earthy flavor better. If you like a robust tasting tea without being too strong or bitter then try this oolong!

review/summary: Bitter, and not like oolong should actually taste.
review/text: If you are a tea snob, you know that Oolong isn't just another kind of tea--it's meant to be steeped multiple times, with fifteen and twenty second timings to bring out the layers of taste.<br /><br />A tea sommelier would also tell you that what's in tea bags is the 'fannings' or the dust from tea production, so you're not getting great tea from tea bags.  (And frankly, you don't drink champagne every day, either, so why be bothered by having less-than-perfect-tea?)<br /><br />Um, well...having had reasonably good loose Oolong in the recent past, I can tell you that this doesn't compare.  Good oolong, like the stuff Twinings sells in their Origins line, is a little like drinking grass in the initial steepings and then like drinking liquid teak, but it's not so bitter that it needs sweetener.<br /><br />This, on the other hand, is just bitter as a main taste.  I'm wondering if it's because Amazon's stock is old;  more oxidation might make this more bitter than it should be.<br /><br />Kudos to Bigelow for even trying to bring cheap Oolong to the masses--but if you really want to know what oolong is supposed to taste like, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Delicate, flavorful Tea
review/text: I was very happy to find this tea, as it reminds me of wonderful Saturdays spent when I was a young girl. Prior to World War II the main amusements available were movies and my best friend and I had a standing date to see the latest matinee at a nearby theatre. But first, we went to a lovely little Chinese restaurant across the street and had a delicious plate lunch, complete with ice cream for dessert.  The tea was served in small egg-shaped cups by an older Chinese waiter who looked like he had just stepped out of a tapestry, and it was delicious!  Our mothers had provided each of us just enough money for our repast, plus 10 cents each for a tip, and we had our admission, 20 cents, 10 cents for treats and a nickel for the phone call home when we were finished. We were too shy to ask about the tea, but my mother found out it was "Oo Long", which had the same flavor blance as this Bigelow Tea.  The memories are priceless but this tea is reasonable and worthy of tasting!

review/summary: Smooth, creamy toffee flavor
review/text: The Baskin-Robbins pralines and cream flavor gives me a nice, smooth, creamy toffee flavor.  Because they use Splenda as the sweetener, the candies have no bitter after-taste.  This candy allows me to have all of the sweetness of regular hard candies with none of the guilt.  The package says that the serving size is four pieces, with a total calorie count of 45 calories.  That works out to just over 11 calories per candy.  It's a guilt-free treat!<br /><br />I like the pralines and cream flavor very much.  It reminds me of the original Werther's candies because it has a similar creamy toffee flavor.  But the Baskins-Robbins candies are made in the USA.  I prefer to save an American job when I can, so for me that's yet another reason to buy this brand of candy.

review/text: This was the first Yerba Mate that I tried. After reading a lot of good things about this tea I thought it would make a good coffee alternative. And I still drink Yerba Mate today, just not this brand. Yerba Mate has a naturally bitter taste to it which takes a bit getting used to. With this particular tea they tried to sweeten it up by adding stevia. However, it just doesn't work. There is still the bitter taste but now you have an additional weird artificial taste that doesn't really improve things. I know stevia is a natural sweetener but I just don't like the taste of it, and therefore I didn't like this tea. The Mate Factor makes loose Yerba Mate that I found much more agreeable.

I am a caramel lover and not really a fan of butterscotch but somehow this combination just makes the best tasting caramel ever.

The taste is delicious and although it is labeled as "Light", it doesn't really taste that way.  As with their other flavors, its heavy on the broth but that's fine with me as I drink the broth and eat the soup with a spoon.  According to the label, it has only 60 calories and 0 grams of fat, which is hard to beat. As with most "light" soups, its also spicy so if you don't like your food spicy, this may not be for you.<br /><br />I have an Amazon subscription for this soup and enjoy the free shipping, convenience and discounts via "subscribe and save".  The (current) price can also be found at grocery stores but they can't compare with the convenience of having it delivered to your house and the small sales tax savings.

My first 100 pack was fine but the second had around 5 empty packets which had opened and leaked all over the inside of the box. It looks like the top flap of the packet is supposed to be folded down as a secondary seal but all 100 in this box were not (probably a manufacturing equipment glitch), and it doesn't take much for the primary adhesive seal to come undone. If buying these at the store, first tilt the box around and verify that no sugar leaks out.

review/text: The picture is misleading.  The onions I received were super minced.  The picture makes it look like the onions are bigger and more "flake" shaped.  I wanted to rehydrate them to be about the size of rice or maybe a hair bigger.  Maybe I received the wrong item?

review/summary: Nice to have on hand!
review/text: These onions can be used in anything calling for onions!  (Duh, I guess that's easy to figure out!)  I like to rehydrate some and use them in omelettes or scrambled eggs I do in the microwave.  Also, I put them in drained tuna with mayo, put it on bread with American cheese and grill it on the stove for a tasty sandwich. (I let it stand for awhile so the onions soak up the extra water from the tuna before I put the sandwich together and grill it,ummm, good!!)

review/text: or even available on my counter. When that happens, these step right in. If I'm adding them to a liquid, I just pour them in. If to a salad, I rehydrate them with water or another liquid. And they seem to last forever in the pantry so I'm always stocked with (organic) onions.

review/text: I have been drinking this tea for years. Recently I noticed It was hard to find in any of the local stores. I finally called Celestial  directly only to be told they stopped making this Flavor, much to my dismay. Maybe if we all start a letter writing campaign they will reconsider. It really is delicious!  For now we will have to search the net for what's left out there...??? Amazon is a good place to start!

review/summary: Not the best Jasmine Phoenix Pearls for sure
review/text: I bought this tea because Jasmine green tea is my favorite flavor.  I have always spend top dollars to buy the best Jamine Phoenix Pearls and have tried many different brands.  By far, this is one of the few on the bottom of my list.  The tea from Elmwood Inn is lacking Jasmine flavor, and the green tea does not taste as fresh.  When you brew a good cup of Jasmine tea, you should be able to smell the fresh morning Jasmine and the tea should taste refresh that almost lifts your spirit.  This tea did not smell nor taste any freshness.  Will not buy again.  Another disappointing tea that I've got from Elmwood Inn.

review/summary: OVER PRICED
review/text: I was advised by a health care professional to eat prunes daily as a means of supplementing my fiber intake.  I was skeptical, but I gave it a try.  I discovered to my mild astonishment that prunes can taste better than I remembered them from distant past experiences, and here they are available on Amazon.  The prunes are available as a Kirkland product, and Costco shoppers realize that Kirkland is the Costco store brand, or something like that.<br /><br />So, I was further actually astonished to discover that my local Costco store sells this same product, 3.5 pound bag, for the amount of $6.40 instead of the $18 to $20 price as they are on Amazon.  Why should anyone pay that much when the same item is sold in Costco stores for $6.40?  Is this some kind of a gouge?

review/summary: date expiration?
review/text: Nomally when i have bought pre-packaged indian food, it typically has a life expectancy of at least 6 months or longer. Just received package. Have not tried it yet but, the expiration date is sept 2012. So i have 6 weeks to eat all of these? that's pretty terrible since I thought that if i purchased something off of amazon, it would not have an expiration date so soon...:(. Because of this, even if this is tasty, I won't buy it again. I would rather buy something that will have a longer life expectancy (like if I bought it straight from the store...)

review/summary: Excellent Paneer Cubes in mild creamy sauce
review/text: Rich sauce, mild flavor with only a hint of heat, but plenty of dimension thanks to a well rounded combination of gentle spices, and lovely large chunks of paneer.  Several other brands offer Paneer Butter Masala/Paneer Makahani in convenient foil pouches,  but of the ones we've tried Sanskriti has the best paneer.  Other brands have squishy little bits of paneer so soft they disintegrate when the dish is heated.  The cubes in Sanskriti are firm, large and much more like what you'd find in restaurant or even home cuisine, where the paneer is baked before cutting into cubes to ensure structural integrity.  There is also more cream and cashew butter in the sauce as compared to other brands, so if you prefer a tangy tomato flavor, this is not for you - it's creamy all the way, while the tomato is just a well-subdued accent.<br />I'd give the sauce five stars, but my husband says he finds it too mild, and would give it four.  It is certainly NOT medium as indicated by the colorful chile pepper scale on the front of the box.  Any way you look at it, a great fast meal, reasonably priced, and with excellent creamy comfort-food satisfaction.

review/summary: Great selection of coffee, but maybe I got lucky?!?!
review/text: This was a great selection of coffee that I managed to pick up at a great price ($16.49).  It contains most every Bold variety with just a few repeated.  I prefer the bolds but for some they may be very strong and overwhelming so make sure to check into it if this is the first time.  THEY also work great if you like to add ice to your coffee as it doesn't get weak/watery.  At the regular price it isn't anything special but if you watch the price and can get it for cheap this is a great selection to fill up your stock.  The dates on them were all into mid-August or later and I received in mid-June (2 months).  Another thing seems to be how the assortment works out.  I only received 7 Decafs and 28 Regular :)

I had not had the opportunity to sample several of the varieties included in this pack (which included offerings from Green Mountain Coffee, Coffee Lovers, Emeril, Wolfgang Puck, Starbucks and others).

review/summary: K Cup bold sampler, includes some decaf (YAY!)
review/text: I like bold coffee--and so far, the Tully's has been my favorite, but there are others that are as good like the Green Mountain and the Newman's Own. But there have been few choices of decaf except for Columbian, which I like the least of any coffee (it's very acidic, not to my tastes at all.) This sampler has three decaf choices and a number of bold blends I have not tasted before. The only problem is that locally, I have not found some of them, including any decaf other than the Columbian. Still, it was nice to have a taste test to see if there are other bold blends in K-cup that I might prefer.
