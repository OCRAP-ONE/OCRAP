review/summary: The best
review/text: I recently quit smoking and suddenly lost interest in coffee. I always loved my coffee and hated tea... This tea is the only one i will drink NOW! I put a bit honey in mine and it is out of this world! I think I found it in The Fresh Market, but I am not sure... Got this tea long time ago and did not like it as a smoker.... But who likes tea is gonna love this flavor!

review/summary: Well deserved snobbery!
review/text: Grey Poupon has star spot in my kitchen. I eat it almost every day and cook with it too. It has a flavor that brightens up everything. Beyond goat cheeses, wine, and quiche, Grey Poupon is something the French can be proud of  though its truly underutilized by the average American cook. Some of my favorite pasta sauces include it along with the usual grating cheeses. You'd also be amazed by tofu cooked in a simmer sauce made with the stuff. (I feel the glare of the average french food critic.) Look for some interesting recipes with the stuff and enjoy.

review/summary: Good -Bye Yellow Stuff!
review/text: I've never used much mustard, but I've always had a jar of the yellow stuff around for whatever purpose might come up. Then some time ago, I began noticing somewhat humorous TV ads for Grey Poupon. I ignored them, but then one day I picked up a two-jar pack (just like this, except 16 ounces) of Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard made with white wine at my local warehouse club. Wow! This stuff is really impressive and goes wonderfully with a wide variety of foods. Now my usage of mustard has gone way up. It's low in calories, inexpensive and flavorful in a delicious, zesty way. My jars have a little sticker that indicates it picked up a Gold Medal at the Napa Valley 12th Annual Mustard Festival. No surprise! Good-bye yellow stuff.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Thumbs up for coconut oil
review/text: While we use coconut oil for "medicinal" purposes, we have experienced a new medium for pan cooking.  Frying or scrambling eggs with it, substituting it for butter on noodles, adding it to boiling water prior to cooking pasta are some of its uses in our house.  I eat a bowl of oatmeal each morning.  I add cinnamon, raisins, raspberries, blueberries, Splenda, a tablespoon of diatomaceous earth, and a heaping teaspoon of coconut oil before heating in the microwave.  The flavor of the coconut oil is neutral, so it doesn't alter the flavor a bit.

review/summary: All hail Amy's!!
review/text: I have pretty much been living on Amy's food for about 8 years now, when I can't eat fresh or am too lazy to cook from scratch. The Berliner family (Amy's Mom and Dad) has done the world a major service in proving that frozen and canned food can be truly healthy. (Please stay private! Going public and thinking mainly of profits will ruin the food, no doubt.)<br /><br />Their pesto pizza is so good it's ridiculous. I've eaten about a thousand of those, maybe two. All their products are hand-made from organic ingredients, and the prices are more than fair considering the quality.<br /><br />I love Thai food, especially Tom Kha and green curry (hint hint, Miss Amy!). This soup holds up well to some of the better TKs I've had in good Thai restaurants. It is spicy but not overwhelming, creamy but not too thick, and in general simply dang yummy!! Easily the best canned Thai soup I've ever had (except for Satay soups, made by Austin's wonderful Foo Swasdee, but sadly her canned food biz stopped a while back (her restaurants are still here, though, and still great. Foo is a wonderful lady!)).<br /><br />Good Thai chow is almost everything I want from food: nutritious and healthy and extremely tasty, with many flavors complementing but not overwhelming each other. This soup is all that.<br /><br />And as always with organic food, by buying this not only are you getting the healthiest food, you're helping support people who care about the health of our planet, and not supporting people who don't.<br />Many thanks to the Berliner family for making the best pre-packaged food on the planet.<br /><br />I could live on this stuff.<br /><br />Wait...I do...

review/summary: Not the best Amy's product
review/text: I have loved every Amys product that I have tried [well over 30 items].  This is the exception.  The soup is a runny liquid with few vegetables.  The flavor has much to be desired--very oily with an over-powering lemon aftertaste.  The flavor immediately made me think "so this is what lemon pine sol tastes like."  There have to be a better options.  Don't give up on Amys if this is your first experience--close your eyes and pick one of the other Amys flavors because it will taste better than this.  If it were thicker, with more vegetables and a bit more coconut over lemon, maybe it would be worthy of three stars. Maybe.

review/summary: Favorite Soup
review/text: This is my favorite soup bar none.  The flavors are well blended, nicely spiced but not overly so.  This is not a thick cream-based soup, but is very filling nonetheless because of the coconut milk.  There is a layer of natural fat that rises to the top in the can when below 70 degrees - this can be scooped off if you are fat conscious and watching fat calories.  The fats are, however, good fats, and with all the recent nutritional press re: the thermogenic benefits of coconut oil you can't go wrong.  The spices are also considered thermogenic - this is a fantastic soup if you are trying to shed weight because there are no empty-caloried starches in the soup (such as rice, white potato, etc.).  The fact that it is entirely organic and made by someone who is committed to only marketing healthy foods makes it a sure thing - great recipe, quality ingredients, beneficial for health and weight loss.  I'm hooked.

review/text: This so-called Tom Kah soup only resembles the "real thing" vaguely, by the fact that it contains coconut milk.  It is thin and watery, doesn't have enough vegetables in it, and its flavor is pleasant but not distinguished.<br />It doesn't compare to the Tom Kah soup served at my local Thai restaurant, nor for that matter, to my homemade version. I will use all these cans as a  base and add white meat chicken, thinly sliced onions, more carrots, lime juice, more lemongrass, fish sauce and hot sauce - then I will have true  Tom Kah soup.  In other words, practically start from scratch. I won't buy any more of it, that's for sure!

review/summary: Shouldn't be called Tom Kha
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised to see this in the organic section of my local grocer. Bought 2 cans, got home, and was ready to tear my new discovery up!<br /><br />After 1 bite I was ready to throw my bowl in the sink, it was wretched. I took a 2nd bite to make sure I wasn't hallucinating on how the potato taste took over the entire soup. By the 3rd bite, I was done. It was as if the potato sucked up all the spices and left the entire soup bland, its all I could taste besides a hint of the coconut. For a second I thought I was dining at a Luby's restaurant it was so bland.<br /><br />This is not a good substitute to what you can get in a Thai restaurant. I would suggest the following products, of which I would give 4 or 5 stars:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDL1J4">Thai Kitchen Coconut Ginger Soup, 14 Ounces (Pack of 12)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7WM3W">A Taste of Thai Coconut Ginger Soup Base, 2.1-Ounce Packets (Pack of 12)</a><br />They are more on par with the authentic taste.<br /><br />I would stay clear of this soup. If you still want to try it, I would suggest going to your local grocer and pick up 1 can only and go from there.

Salt, pepper & garlic chicken breast and saute until golden brown.  Remove from pan.  Add fresh green beans with a small amount of water and olive oil to loosen the browning in pan from the chicken.  Cook green beans to desired tenderness then add the can of Amy's Thai Coconut soup and chicken to pan.  Simmer for 5 - 10 minutes until warmed and serve over rice.

review/summary: Pretty good for a canned soup!
review/text: I am really surprised by the bad reviews on here! I am a lover of Thai food and Tom Kha soup is on my list of favorites for sure. I bought this soup thinking it would resemble the soup I am served in restaurants but I certainly didn't expect it to be the same thing! It's in a can, people!  I actually thought it was better than expected.  The broth is more watery than the authentic version, but has a nice flavor.  The sweet potatoes are plentiful, and the mushrooms are delicious. There were more green beans than anything, and they were mushy, but they're always mushy, right? There's a nice amount of tofu and I appreciate the fact that it is firm, since I do not like eating soft tofu.  I wondered what else I was going to eat with the soup, since it's a small can, but to my surprise I felt quite full after finishing it.  I would definitely buy this again and encourage anyone to give it a try. I bought the can on sale for a little over $2 and think it was well worth the cost.

I'm sure the options there might exceed this for authenticity and even general taste, but as a vegan and kosher product, it's tasty (at least to my palate) and a pleasant change from a lot of other options. I usually see this sold (often only in specialty stores) for between $3.75-4.50/can, so this is a great price.<br /><br />(By the by, the slime on top is indeed the coconut oil. Coconut fat is solid at room temperature. As one reviewer pointed out, you can lower the calories but discarding the oleaginous goo stuck to the lid.)

review/text: Most of the reviews are comparing this to some very unhealthy versions (like "my local restaurant") which is not fair.  It is about as healthy as you can get and still use real ingredients.  I like that it is not so loaded with salt (as others have complained).  It has a delicate flavor, and I didn't notice any aftertaste.  It was a little light in the veggies, but doesn't really need them to be good.  If you want taste at "all costs" then this is not for you.  If you generally eat healthy and are not addicted to salt you will like this soup very much.  I bought a can (at a local store) and ate it later that day, I went back to the store the next day for another can.

Try one can first if at all possible. The can says "Best by Sep 2012" but I believe it will take a lot longer than that to get to "best".  I had to eat something else to satisfy my hunger and I still have the aftertaste of the soup.  Or maybe it was the carrot that had all but disintegrated, it was very mushy.  I am surprised it had maintained its shape.  I was not about to try any other vegetable.  Others advise adding ingredients but more power to them.  I don't see how one can doctor this soup to edibility.  The instructions say heat and serve.  I say don't bother.

review/summary: Tastes like dish soap
review/text: I've never found an Amy's soup I didn't like...until now. I thought I'd try something new and from the description this seemed tasty, but that was not the case. First of all, the soup was incredibly thin. Most of Amy's soups are thicker & heartier. Secondly, there were a couple of large leaves in the soup (couldn't deduce what they are from the ingredient list) that would've been better off left out of the finished product. Thirdly, the pieces of tofu in the soup are miniscule and tasteless - hardly worth inclusion. Lastly, the taste of the soup made it nearly inedible for me. The combination of the overpowering lemongrass with the coconut milk combined to make something that tasted a lot like what I imagine dish soap to taste like. I will NOT be purchasing this soup ever again. And while I am thrilled that a company like Amy's offers so many great vegan options, I won't be recommending this to my vegan friends either.

review/summary: Hit or Miss
review/text: As a previous reviewer already mentioned, this soup seems to be a hit or miss. I loved it, and my boyfriend, who also tried a spoon, loved it too. The first spoonful gave me a "hmm," reaction. By the third spoon, I decided that it was pretty good. Not exactly what I was expecting, but good nevertheless. The base is creamy, slightly salty, and were it not for a delayed hint of lime and sweet coconut, I would almost think was cream of mushroom. This soup has mushrooms in it, by the way. They have a nice texture and taste pretty good. There also are carrots and greenbeans, which, as in all of the other Amy's soups, turn to mush the second you put them in your mouth. I don't mind that at all. There are also bits of tofu, which seem to be the least mushy and have a nice ... meaty (?!) texture. The tofu doesn't really taste like anything, which is a relief because I find some tofu to be bitter. There are tiny bits of yam here and there, and they don't taste like yam. In fact, I don't taste yam at all in this, despite it being an ingredient.<br /><br />I cooked this for 5 minutes on high heat until boiling. I highly recommend taking the bay leaf out of the can before cooking, because the soup doesn't need more bay leaf flavor. The picture on the can is not really accurate. The broth is orange in color. That must be where the yams went.<br /><br />I was sick when I first tried this soup. I find it hard to eat anything when I'm sick, so the fact that I ate this is astounding.

But I finally tried the Chunky Tomato Bisque, and it was out of this world. So I had to try the other offerings. So far, every other Amy's soup that I've tried has been mediocre at best. But we go through a 2-3 cases of the Chunky Tomato Bisque each month.

review/summary: Um...not so great!
review/text: I really wanted to like this soup. It's organic, it's supposed to be good...it's Amy's, who has a great reputation in the natural foods community...but omigosh, this soup leaves SOOO much to be desired. It's mildly sweet, very thin, and the coconut taste is almost nonexistent. Mine had little pieces of green beans, sweet potatoes, carrots...I LOVE THAI food...but this is nothing like Thai food. No heat, no spice, just sorta mediocre white coconut milk with some good-for-you veggies and some tiny pieces of rubbery tofu. I normally try to be as honest and forthright as possible, but I also try to be nice and find something good about every product. The only thing I can say good about this product is that it was available in my local supermarket and I bought one can to try it before I bought 12 from Amazon! If you find you like it, it's also much cheaper on Amazon (many things are!)and you may want to order a case of it. For me, I'm glad that I spent a bit more on the one can and tried it before I bought a ton of it here. It's just...well, I finished the bowl, but I sure wasn't impressed at all. It's just plain weird. :(

review/summary: Kind of Gross
review/text: I bought this soup in the store and as a HUGE fan of Tom Kah soup and Amy's products, I was seriously disappointed with this version. The broth is not as flavorful as the Tom Kah soups I've had before, and the tofu is kind of hard/rough so the textures do not meld well. Definitely pass on this one- her others are wonderful though!<br /><br />Pros<br />- Similar to Tom Kah soup<br />- Shiitake Mushrooms that are in it are good<br /><br />Cons<br />- Veggies have mush in your mouth canned texture<br />- Broth is oily, thin, and weak in flavor<br />- Tofu is rough and crumbly

review/summary: Only the barest resemblance to the real thing
review/text: Besides being organic I can't find much of anything else positive to say about this product.  It's buried in salt (one can eats up half your recommended sodium intake) - http://www.amazon.com/Amys-Organic-Thai-Coconut-14-1-Ounce/dp/nutrition-facts/B000G17682 - virtually killing any authentic flavor it might contain.  And there's not even a hint of any of the vegetables taht are supposed to be in Tom Kha Phak.  If you're in desperate straits and you need something remotely "ethnic" and are not hypertensive then this might work since it does have coconut milk in it.  Amy, try adding some vegetables, funghi, herbs and spices; AND taking out at least 1/2 the salt!

review/text: I bought a case of this and was thoroughly disappointed. My son and I love Thai soups, but this was incredibly bland. We tried to spice it up, but it would have been better just to start from scratch. The best Thai soup we have found is coconut ginger soup from a Taste of Thai - it's incredible and much better than this. We had four cans of the case and that was all we could stand.

review/text: There's a strange orange-red oily film on the top.  It's really gross if you don't open the can before opening.<br /><br />I would send this soup back if I got it at a Thai restaraunt.  I thought maybe the first few cans were bad, but the whole case was like this.  It doesn't taste anywhere close to what I expect from Thai food.  Just oil, a bit of coconut, a teeny bit of curry.  It's mostly flavorless oil.<br /><br />There is barely any tofu or veggies.  There are so many much better choices out there.  Skip this one.

Green beans are crisp but the carrots are utter mush. I adore Amy's other soups (minestrone, no chicken noodle, lentil, tomato, etc) and frozen entrees, but this stuff looks disgusting and tastes pretty bad too. When you heat this in the microwave, the grease separates from the soup, leaving an orange coat over the top that won't stir back in.<br /><br />The one bright spot of the soup is a real bay leaf.<br /><br />Don't bother, trust me!

review/text: Sparx is a mild fruity mint that has a nice taste. After Radiation treatment for cancer I relied on Sparx to keep my mouth moist. Because I had chronic dry mouth I used Sparx under my tongue to stimulating my sublingual saliva gland. This was the only one not destroyed by radiation. With sparx I also got the benefit of Xylitol which is used for sweetening the mint. Xylitol is proven to have as good or better benefit for preventing cavities than floride. Dry mouth makes it more likely that you will have dental problems. Sparx has helped me with my dental care and it definitly works.

review/text: I bought this thinking it would be a wonderful macadamia nut flavor. Boy was I wrong. My taste may be different to most other people because of my diet, but the macadamia nuts are blended with PEANUT OIL and that is ALL that I taste, smell, and feel on my tongue. Peanut, oil, yuck. I even tried baking what I had into a dish, tried puting it on top of something to add some flavor. I still only taste, smell, and feel peanut oil. Maybe the company thinks that is ok, but in my opinion if someone is buying something niche like macadamia nut butter, it should be macadamias and maybe salt.

review/summary: Parboil Spinach Lasagna Noodles -- No
review/text: I spent a lot of time making my homemade lasagna and decided to use these parboil lasagna noodles.  Turned out terrible.  I'll never invest the time and money to make homemade lasagna and use a parboil nooodle again.  It was awful.  At the end of the day I had to ask myself how lazy I could be not to take the time to cook my lasagna first.  I guess if you're making a throw-together lasagna with cottage cheese, this would be fine.  But I was making my sauce from scratch and using ricotta and other real ingredients.  Took forever to cook, spilled over in the oven (after adding the recommended 3/4 cup of water to my recipe which is another mess I have to confront).  So, no, we couldn't taste the specialness of the spinach noodles because, quite frankly, they weren't really cooked.  I wasted all day cooking my favorite lasagna only to have it ruined by these parboil noodles.  I have purchased other pasta from Rossi that was absolutely delicious but when it comes to lasagna, I say don't be tempted by the "parboil" feature.  I'll buy these again but cook before I put them in my lasagna.

I vacuum packed all of it in small jars, there was no bubbling or problems, just pure delightful dry fruit. As a matter of fact I am chewing on those dates right now as I type this review. LOL<br />I placed and order with Amazon for 2 more bags yesterday.<br />So, do yourself, your better half and your kids if you have them a favor, and switch from teeth enamel and metabolism busting sucrose candies to this treat. They are wicked sweet but completely fruity natural and no chemicals. In the long run your dentist may not like it, but your stomach will certainly appreciate it. Good product - even Egyptian pharaohs knew that.<br /><br />Update 10/12/2011<br />Dates came in on imte and just as expected, and they are supreme in quality. I had them vacuum packed immediately, Life is good.

review/summary: Decent dates for a great price, but not all bags are moist. UPDATE
review/text: I live in California and have access to gorgeous fresh organic dates. I'm spoiled, so I didn't expect much from these dates. I bought them because I have been on a date kick lately, and it was starting to get a little pricy($8.99 per pound) to buy so many organic dates.<br /><br />These dates weren't too bad. My only complaint is the inconsistency of the bag; there were soft chewy ones and tough rubbery ones which were still edible but not as tasty.<br /><br />I love to fill these with pumpkin seed butter and make healthy peanut butter cups. If anyone is looking for a peanut butter cup alternative I recommend Omega nutrition brand pumpkin seed butter, because it tastes most like peanut butter.<br />I slice the date down the center and fill them with the seed butter. Simple, fast, and delicious!<br /><br />$13.49 for a 40 oz of dates? Not too bad :)<br /><br />Update:<br />Two things to report since my review:<br /><br />1. I found a pit in one of the dates. This isn't a problem for me since I always open my dates to stuff them, but someone who is not paying close attention could break a tooth.<br /><br />2. I was saddened that my last shipment of dates was very dry and stale. After 4 bags of moist chewy dates, the 5th bag is dry.<br /><br />I have deducted stars for this issue. I have not yet decided whether or not I will reorder these date.  I guess I'll give em one more chance. If the quality is not good on the next bag, I'll consider cutting down on my date addiction.

review/summary: very good dates
review/text: That was the 1st time I bought them. They are very good dates, large size, not very dry but not watery either. I would not like them to be more moistened because it would add only the weight to the pack  but not the quality ))) I finished them faster than I planned. They are so delicious!!! I want to buy them again, however, the price jumped up. I will wait then. I will definitely recommend them to all who like healthy food. Thanks

review/summary: Good for the price
review/text: These dates are priced very well. They are quick and safe snack - no pits. Not as meaty as medjool dates, and it is a mixed bag. That is, some of them are more moist than the others. Some are on the dry side, but not too dry to make this unpleasant. Good option for a healthy snack that is cheaper than premium dates.

review/text: I ripped open one of the bags and popped a few pieces into my mouth, and was appalled at how they tasted. They were not what I remembered! I cracked open one of the pieces to find that the peanut inside had white spots on it, which may or may not have been mold. I looked for an expiration date and instead found a code: 2167CX. After some research I found that the first digit indicates the year of production. I was horrified. This candy was made in 2002! Steer clear of Farley's and Sathers candy on this site unless you like 9+ year old candy!

review/summary: Excellent grinder
review/text: This is a generous size sea salt grinder.  It is quite impressive;  there is an adjustable knob inside the top to get the appropriate size grind you need.  You can grind sea salt up to a very fine powder if you choose.  WE LIKE!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Do need to caution that the salt is very intense(Sodium: 3150 mg per 1 tsp serving).  Do not need to use a lot. The fine grind works perfectly to prevent over salting your food; however, it will take a lot of wrist/arm power. We grind @ fine setting and put in a salt shaker for future use.  Might be a lot of trouble; however, will prevent getting too much salt @ one time.  You can add salt, not easy to remove after grind.

review/summary: REAL cinnamon sticks!
review/text: Canella is REAL cinnamon from Sri Lanka, not the cinnamon most Americans use which is actually a cousin of canela, called Cassia. Real cinnamon (canela) is milder and has no heat, so will not upset your stomach. Usually canela is ground right when you need it, but the powder is also available. (If the spice is called cinnamon on the label, but is not from Sri Lanka, it is probably cassia.) If you want the "punch" of cinnamon (say in curry) this is not the kind to use. But in baking, sweets, hot cocoa, it is PERFECT! We use the stick as stirrers, too, to let the spice gently infuse itself into the drink.

review/summary: The real thing not the imposter
review/text: This is the Real Cinnamon (canela) not the Chinese cinnamon (cassia). What you get is 12 packs of long cinnamon sticks. The sticks average between 5 to 5 1/4 inches (see pics). Each pack varies in quantity. One pack may have 4 sticks the other may have 3, another 5 and so on. I bought these to use in my tea. When making tea I use 1 stick of Melissa's cinnamon compared to 4 sticks of the store bought cinnamon. This cinnamon has a sweet and delicate taste compared to the strong peppery taste from store bought cinnamon. This cinnamon is also soft and easy to grind up for use in baking. Real cinnamon vs cassia make a huge difference to your recipe. 5 stars for a great product.<br /><br />Here is how you tell the difference between real cinnamon and cassia. Canela cinnamon sticks appear rolled in one direction, similar to a rolled up newspaper. Cassia sticks curl inward from both sides toward the center. Cassia Cinnamon bark is thicker those making the stick hard. In contrast canela is soft easy to grind up and one can see the bristles. See pics<br /><br />"Both cassia and real cinnamon contain coumarin, a fragrant chemical compound that can be toxic in large amounts. Real cinnamon contains about 0.004 percent of coumarin, which is a very small amount. Cassia or "fake cinnamon" contains much more, at about 5 percent." Coumarin is known to cause liver and kidney damage in "high" concentrations.

I used to get similar items -- chili and lime flavored peanuts -- from Latin America.  Those packets came so infrequently that each peanut was like gold.  Frankly, the almond makes for a better vehicle in the flavor department.  And they're great for you.  This snack is a slam dunk!

review/summary: Not Sesame Seed Oil.
review/text: Maybe I was incorrect in thinking that this was the Sesame Seed Oil normally used in Oriental cooking. This oil is basically flavorless, like a Canola oil. It makes a decent cooking oil but if you're looking for the flavor of dark Sesame Seed oil, this product isn't it. It simply does NOT have the smoky, nutty flavoring that I was expecting. The couple Oriental dishes I prepared with it lacked the flavor you get when using the dark oil. Not a bad oil, just not what I thought I was buying. If you're looking for a light, flavorless Sesame Oil then this is the one.

review/summary: Healthy oil for cooking at high tempuratures
review/text: I bought sesame oil, not for the flavor but because I believe it's the healthiest oil, extra virgin olive oil excepted, there is. Of course olive oil is not good for cooking at high temperatures whereas this oil is. I like the size of the bottles too. My only complaint is that, like so many oils, this is packaged in plastic. I prefer, for environmental reasons, glass packaging, but of course that increases the weight and shipping costs and would thus add cost to the product. But as far as the product goes, it's great. I read one reviewer complain that it does not have the "Asian sesame" aroma or flavor. That's true but depending on one's perspective, that can be a good thing. It can be used as a cooking oil for any dish and won't ruin the flavor because of it. Read up about the health benefits of sesame oil and I believe you'll be happy with this product. If you're an Amazon Prime member, you'll be even happier.

No other popcorn salt I've tried has been this yummy.<br /><br />I ordered a large supply some years ago from Johnny's website when I stopped being able to find it in stores, but now that Amazon has it in bulk for a decent price and no shipping, I'll be stocking up here. FYI, it does contain MSG, lots by the taste of it. I've never had a reaction to it and absolutely love that good old MSG savor. Try it and see!

review/text: I bought this awhile ago before I had really done any research on what was in it and just what all this artificial dye is doing to us. Especially RED #40. This dye is worse than sugar for kids and it being linked as one of leading causes for why our ADHD rates are supposedly so high these days. I watched my child run around like he had gone on a candy bing at the M&M factory and was trying to burn off a sugar high. I was horrified to read that artificial dyes make up over half the list of ingredients. Needless to say, we will never be purchasing this product again and will be throwing out the remaining container. With all the natural dye alternatives that are available and being used as consumers are becoming more aware of how harmful these things are, I find it irresponsible that this company is still producing a product containing so many artificial dyes.

By the time I buy the San Marzano tomatoes myself, and the onions, olive oil, garlic, basil, and seasoning it actually seems to be a fairly good deal--especially since it tastes just as good as homemade.  There are no strange preservatives or other scary ingredients---only San Marzano tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil, garlic, salt, parsley, basil, oregano, and black pepper.<br /><br />This really saved me a lot of time and I was proud to put my final dish on the table.  No one was the wiser.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: A Lot of Pasta Sause
review/text: Haha they give you so much!  But it's totally worth it, I gave 2 away and signed up for every 3 months for the subscription discount.  I love the flavor, too bad it's not in my stores.  I also mix in some mushrooms and turkey meat to add a little more nutrition.  5 ******. Thanks!

review/summary: Flavorful product.
review/text: We like this pasta sauce more than other (like prego) on the market.  The sauce is thicker and tastier.  Amazon packaging need to improve since one of the bottle cap crack during the shipping.

review/summary: Yum
review/text: This spaghetti sauce tastes good and has nice chunks of veggies in it. It is pretty flavorful and I find that I don't have to add a lot of seasonings to it for it to taste good. It is not a thin or runny sauce. The size of the jar is great for larger batches of pasta and the price here at Amazon is much better than the grocery store! I also like the fact that these come in plastic jars as opposed to glass. I find that it keeps well for about a week or so in the fridge if you do not use the whole jar at once. I am pleased with the purchase and would recommend this Ragu Chunky Pasta Sauce if you like a thick, rich sauce.

review/summary: Really good sauce!
review/text: Not as many chunks as I would have thought but I'm still very satisfied. Not only is it good on pasta but it makes a fine pizza sauce too. The garlic and onion flavors are present but not overpowering at all.

review/summary: The best deal!
review/text: With high grocery prices in my area I'm always on the search for a deal and this has to be one of the best deals I've ever found on Amazon. The jars are larger than the normal grocery size so they really last. The jars are plastic and they double box, so they were in perfect shape when delivered. With the subscribe and save option it is an even better deal. The tomato, garlic, and onion was out of stock for a bit, but it did end up coming back in so I was able to order again. Highly recommend if you go through pasta sauce as quickly as we do!
