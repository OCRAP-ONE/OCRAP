The only difference is, these cost 14 cents more an ounce than they cost me at Safeway. And they are even less at Target.<br /><br />As for the product itself, my son loves them and I buy many of them at target.

review/summary: Best of the pumpkin kcups
review/text: This kcup was pretty tasty once you get past the weird smell while brewing.  It was described as a bit "funky" by some coworkers.  I tried it out anyway and was impressed.  It's very smooth and has a nice pumpkin flavor.  It gets better as it cools.  The clove flavor is only slighty noticeable which is a very good thing.  The flavor was pretty close to pumpkin pie.  This would mix really well with a good french vanilla kcup and some cinnamon.  The flavor is light years better than the Green Mountain pumpkin spice kcup. It took me a year to get through that box.  I threw out the last few.

review/summary: UPDATE - May not contain BPA
review/text: UPDATE - I heard that Muir Glen had started transitioning their canned tomato products to BPA free cans but when contacting Muir Glen (General Mills), I kept getting a canned (no pun intended) response that they believe BPA is safe...blah blah blah. But today, I finally got the answers I was looking for including how to tell which cans at the grocery store are BPA free. Muir Glen started transitioning to BPA free cans (for their tomato products only) in September 2010. Their shelf life is 2 1/2 years; therefore, an expiration date after March 2013 should be a BPA free can liner. You can confirm it is BPA free when you open the can because the old BPA liner was white, but the new BPA free liner is a copper color. I did ask General Mills to please label their products BPA free to help us consumers when shopping. I hope that eventually all canned goods will be BPA free. Let me know what you find when shopping.<br /><br />I am so excited to have a BPA free Organic tomato product, yay! Thanks Muir Glen!<br /><br />old review -<br />I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! It makes me sick that I fed them with BPA laden baby bottles before I knew better. We already have enough cancer in our family. I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder.<br /><br />I wrote to Muir Glen (now owned by General Mills) to see if they have any plans to remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. I would be happy to pay a bit more for jarred tomato products if they can't come up with BPA free cans. Or how about tomatoes in cartons or frozen?<br /><br />Please write to the companies that you buy canned tomatoes from and ask for BPA free products. Let me know if anyone finds BPA free tomato products, such as tomato paste, diced tomatoes, whole tomatoes...by responding to this comment--I will get an email.<br /><br />I have young children and I will not feed them anymore BPA!!!

review/summary: Why more BPA?
review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

This product is clean right from the bag, I directly dump all of it into my cooking pot and mix a lot of spices and salt and maybe some coconut milk and let it cook in microwave high for about 35 minutes average. This is one of my main protein foods and no matter how much i eat nothing goes wrong. This does not produce flatulence but does help enough with a good digestive system. But stay away from Sadaf red lentils as they are nasty.

review/text: I had to put my son on a gluten free diet, but had a hard time finding an alternative carb source for him.  He refused any of the gluten-free oatmeals I cooked or rice breads.  He was use to his Quaker apple cinnamon instant oatmeal, and this is very similar in texture and taste.  I just add a couple spoonfuls of natural applesauce to sweeten it more, and he eats the whole bowl.  If you are looking for an alternative to the Quaker instant oatmeal packs, this will work out great for you.  My child is super picky, and this past the test with flying colors.

My husband who is not on the gluten free diet loves this oatmeal.He says the oats taste fresher. And for my Celiac college student this product has made his life so much easier.He can have a healthy breakfast in his dorm room or at the food court with no worry of cross-contamination.Like me he always has a packet in his backpack for snacks or a quick lunch.<br /><br />Thank you Glutenfreeda!

We were ecstatic when we learned about Glutenfreeda's Oatmeal being safe for both of us.  It had been soooo long since I could make a packet of flavored oatmeal in a jiffy.  And with my daughter's corn-allergy, it has been even longer for her.  We are now in heaven and love all three flavors.  We eat it for breakfast, snacks, whatever.  It isn't as sweet as we both like it, but a spoon of demerara organic sugar and we're both ready to enjoy.<br /><br />Anyone who can buy any brand or kind of instant oatmeal off the shelf just can not fathom our excitement, but it is truly a wonderful thing to be able to enjoy instant oatmeal again!!

review/summary: Great Instant Oatmeal
review/text: Just found this gluten free oatmeal.  This is for sure the best find of the year.  My kid loves it, but I think its a little too sticky.  That it has fLax in it and my kid will still eat it is an added bonus.

review/summary: Great GF breakfast option!
review/text: I was VERY excited to find this oatmeal on Amazon and at a considerably lower price than what I paid at my local store.  This is a great quick and easy breakfast.  As with any instant oatmeal, items might be added to it to fit each person's preferences, but I think it's good just as it is. :)

review/summary: Hooray!
review/text: I am so grateful to be able to eat oatmeal again!  I have celiac disease and have been gluten-free for about 3 years.  I have always loved breakfast cereal and oatmeal, but I have found that most gluten-free cereals are expensive and tasteless.  So disappointing.  I have tried other oats and have always had reactions.  I figured I could give this a try and see if I tolerated it.  I was pleasantly surprised not just that I could eat them without having symptoms but that the oats themselves are great!  Dig in!

review/summary: Very Happy Dog
review/text: And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.

review/summary: Really Salty
review/text: Bought this item for my 22 month old and my 6 year old to snack on. Neither of the them would touch it after taking the first bite. I tried it to see what the issue was and it was very salty. We are not conservative sodium consumers, so that is not the issue. It's the 350 mg of sodium per serving that is the problem. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I have nearly 4 boxes left of this sitting in my pantry with no one in my family wanting to eat it. I really wanted to like this product because it made it easy to shop for snacks my kids would like online and have it shipped.

review/summary: Good snack in metered portions
review/text: An excellent healthy choice for snacking!  Each box has 8 packages; each package is about 130 calories.  They are slightly larger than most of the 100 calorie packs available now, and I find them equally filling.  The portion size is more than adequate for a snack.<br /><br />They actually taste better than Ritz Bits, which I still like, but now I prefer these.  The price here is similar to what I pay at a local grocery store, but sometimes they are limited in quantity at the store.  Compared to some of the natural markets (Wild Oats, Whole Foods, etc) the pricing here is about half the cost.<br /><br />Well worth the purchase if you like a good cheese & cracker snack in a "metered" portion.

review/text: My kids love Ritz Bits but I don't want them eating those because they are loaded with horrible ingredients. I feel better about giving them these crackers once in while because the ingredients are organic, and they contain no hydrogenated oils or corn syrup. But I wouldn't call these "healthy". They have sugar, no fiber to speak of or other healthy ingredients. They taste very good and my kids like them, but they will remain an occasional treat.

review/summary: Much better than Ritz Bits
review/text: So these are basically Ritz Bits, but with three differences:<br /><br />1.  The crackers are better; they taste more buttery and flavorful.<br /><br />2.  The cheese is better; it actually tastes like something that's met cheese in passing, and maybe even shaken its hand.<br /><br />3.  They're all organic 'n' stuff, so make you feel ever so slightly virtuous, and less like a slave to Big Food.<br /><br />If you're packing lunches for kids (or snacks for yourself), these are great.

review/summary: YUM!!
review/text: We were running to the park last night and I stopped in the grocery store for a few snacks to bring along.  I bought a 5-oz box of these crackers for $3.99.  My son has autism and is *extremely* picky about what he will eat, it is almost impossible to get him to try something new.  But I was hoping he'd give these a try.<br /><br />I was amazed that he took a bite of these...and LOVED them!  He hate half the box at the park!  My 2-year-old and 11-month-old also enjoyed them, and I had to stop myself from stealing the box.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of Ritz bits...I don't like the processed, "fake cheese" taste of them.  The cheese on these tastes so much better.

review/text: My toddler loves these crackers and I do too! They are the best snack now that I am pregnant again in my first trimester.  They are only 120 calories per bag and are just the right salty, cheesy, cracker combo.  They are a little salty, but not too bad (15%).  My son likes them so much that he immediately learned to say 'crackers' after I bought them.<br />I subscribed and got the discounted price, but when I don't need them right away, I can adjust the shipment so I am not drowning in crackers, which is nice!

review/text: I just bought this at my local grocery this morning for a cat who has not been eating.  She gobbled down two containers!  I'm thrilled of course, and went on Amazon to order it in quantity...only to find Amazon's price is higher than my local grocery, which charges $1.29 per 2 oz pack and Amazon is $1.40.  That's 10% higher.  Of course, if I want to sign up for a montly subscription delivery, it brings the price down, but I have found that items sent regular 5 day mail wind up arriving damaged.  The last case of another cat food I ordered through Amazon arrived with three cans crushed and split open.  I had to throw them out.  And that's not the first time that damaged goods have arrived by subscription/regular mail instead of Prime.

review/summary: good quality but TOO MUCH FRUIT
review/text: I love chamomile tea and decided to try this one with fruits because I figured they would enhance the chamomile. This was not the case. Maybe I just got a disproportionate batch but my bag has a lot more fruit than chamomile and this shows in the taste. The orange and lemon greatly overpowers the chamomile. This was great when I had a cold, not so great when I wanted to relax with some chamomile.<br /><br />The quality of the tea is good and that's why my rating is 4-star and not 3-star like I originally intended. I realize that the amount of fruit desired is subjective and I just happen to prefer more chamomile.<br /><br />If every batch of the tea is created like this it should be appropriately named "fruit and chamomile" not the other way around.<br /><br />I will upload a picture of my batch so anyone interested can see. Again, its possible that it was just my bag that had a lot of fruit. I will be ordering Davidson's Tea Bulk again but without fruit.

review/summary: Suprised!
review/text: This tea is wonderful!  I say I'm suprised simply because I am used to "bargain" pricing to mean less than top quality (which I'm ok with if the price is right).  That is NOT the case with this tea (or the African Honeybush I have on auto order) It's a great balance of chamomille and fruit.. brews into a light slightly sweet tea. Great after a stressful day... or as I found recently... put it over ice and it's calming and cool after a hot day working in the yard and garden. I share with my daughters so I'm sure this tea will eventually go on the auto order just like the African Honeybush.

review/text: Pure goodness, can soothe any tempest in a tea cup or temples. The tea has been very effective in putting my client to sleep-8 to 10 hrs. He no longer wakes up to disturb the peace of the entire house. That means risk of falls, daytime sleepiness drasticlly reduced. Means also he is less likely to end up in a nursing home.Peace of mind for everybody--his family and I.<br /><br />I drink it too. It calms me and gives me quality sleep when I desire sleep.

They look like naturally glazed rounded slices of the fruit.  I find Crunchy N Yummy banana to be the most visually appealing of their 'tropical fruit' snacks.<br /><br />Banana is a rich source of magnesium which is used for muscle tone of the heart and assists in controlling blood pressure.  In general, magnesium is used to relax the muscles.  I call Crunchy N Yummy banana my 'relax snack' :))<br /><br />At only 110 calories per 1 ounce serving, you get the great taste and nutrition of a full serving of banana in packs that I can have on the go! I also use Crunchy N Yummy bananas in my cold cereals, yogurt and ice cream toppings.  The kids love them too! ... that's a plus!<br /><br />These banana snacks are 100% natural and certified USDA organic - just sun ripened and freeze dried banana with no additives.<br /><br />Crunchy N Yummy snacks contain no sulfur dioxide (E220), a food preservative commonly used in dried fruit.  (Some individuals may be sensitive to sulfur dioxide especially in large amounts).<br /><br />Check around ... the price varies on Amazon.<br /><br />Hope my review was helpful ... Jeffrey A. (Jeff)

review/text: I had never had pho before, it doesn't seem to be on most Vietnamese restaurant menus.  I was  interested to try this new product, Happy Pho Zesty Ginger since I am a<br />ginger addict, and love star anise.  Mama mia, this thick noodly soup is really a new taste realm for me (already an asian food addict.) I doubled the ginger since I like more ginger than less, making it with chicken  or with tofu (you could also combine.) I haven't had a lime around yet to use, but did use lemon instead and that was excellent. This product is healthy, and when used with tofu, vegan I believe.  I think it's really going to take off with people who care about their nutrition but don't want to sacrifice taste.  I give it two thumbs up!<br />Karen

My 10 year old daughter and I loved it. You know when you eat a meal that's good for you, and it makes your whole body feel good afterwards? That's exactly how we felt after eating Happy Pho. The portions are very generous (2 dinners + leftovers for lunch today) so along with being tasty and healthy, Happy Pho is also a good value. We tried this as an alternative to grocery store ramen noodles, and we'll never buy ramen again. Happy Pho is our new noodle.

review/text: These noodles are quick, simple to make and taste fantastic!  I just threw in whatever meat and veggies I have in my fridge, and they came out tasting great.  I just used ground beef -- cooked it in water with the spice packet -- threw in the noodles, some cilantro and some spinach and it tasted awesome.  If you don't have meat or don't want to use meat, you can use Rapunzel bouillon cubes as a soup base too.  I've done it that way too (for one person just combine one cube of Rapunzel, 2-3 cups of water and half<br />the spice packet, bring to a boil, add a noodle square and a bit of tofu and whatever vegetables you happen to have in your fridge). It's a really healthy, nutritious meal.<br /><br />I'm really happy I found these soups.  They're convenient and the ingredients are simple and nothing that I react to - basically just brown rice and spices - I know I can eat them all the time.  Now I can just keep a few boxes of Happy Pho in my pantry for a quick healthy meal any time, especially on nights when I get home and don't want to cook or have to resort to greasy take-out.

review/text: Our family loves noodles, and I think we're fairly picky about our noodles. I was skeptical at first because I didn't really believe that brown rice pho noodles would be as good as the regular white rice noodles, but these are honestly delicious! My kids - 7, 4 and 1 1/2 loved them. Some noodles become mushy if you cook them for just a minute too long. When I cooked these the first time, I threw them in, and forgot about them, but they retained their shape and taste well, and were even still perfect as leftovers the next day. We've used them in a variety of different soups, in addition to pho - thai soup, japanese hot pot. We're running low now, but I will definitely be buying more.

I liked the opportunity to be creative by varying the vegetables one could add to the packaged  noodles made of brown rice and organic green tea. The wonderful combination of spices brought the whole dish alive with great flavor and fragrance. The ginger and lime, although listed as optional, enhance the flavors. It's nice that it is a one pot or even one wok meal.  I am especially pleased that the product is free of  preservatives and artificial ingredients which I try to avoid for health reasons. I am looking forward to trying the other Happy Pho products.
