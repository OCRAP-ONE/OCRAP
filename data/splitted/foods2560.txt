review/summary: Light Roast. Mild Blend. Smooth Flavor. Not Acidic. Not Full Bodied.
review/text: This Donut House Blend is a light roast coffee. It is not bitter & has a mild flavor.  I brew this in an 8oz cup & find it in the "not too light, but not bold" category.  It works well with a splash of milk.<br /><br />I would categorize this blend in the breakfast coffee category - coffee that you sip during breakfast that will not compete with your food for flavor.  It also works well as an afternoon "pick me up" coffee.<br /><br />If you are looking for a mild blend with no bitterness, check out this blend.

review/summary: Donut house cofee
review/text: I usually like a milder blend of cofffee having said that I decided to try  something different. This coffee is smooth but has for me a stong taste if you like a strong cup of coffee that you can put creamer on and still taste the coffee you will like this one. For me it was to strong for my first cup of black coffee in the morning. I will admit I love this coffee in the evening with some Bailey's Irish Creme in it.

review/summary: Weak - get Emeril's Big Easy Bold!
review/text: On the middle or 'mug' setting of the Keurig B-70, Donut House didn't hold a candle to Emeril's Big Easy Bold k-cup.  Emeril's is superior - truly robust, full and velvety without any hint of a burned, smokey or earthy taste whatsoever, but has a terrific depth and complexity.  Donut House falls short of being an 'extra bold' coffee and is more a medium bodied blend.

review/summary: Did I get a bad batch?
review/text: Donut Shop is one of my favorites. Though it is also the blend I get the most failures with. So I decided to pick up a box of this Donut House flavor at my local Bed Bath & Beyond. To me it is awful! No flavor at all and hardly any color. I normally buy bold flavors/variants and pump the 10oz mug size. I had to lower this one to 8oz to not totally wash it out. I was very hopeful but just forcing my way through the batch. I'm hoping, because of the other reviews that I got a bad batch. So take my review with a grain of salt but I've been using K-Cups for years.

review/text: When I got my Keurig I had heard from friends that the Donut coffee was one of the best.  I hadn't realized that some of them were referring to Dunkin' Donuts coffee, others were referring to Donut SHOP coffee and others were referring to this, Donut HOUSE, coffee.  They're all different.<br /><br />This has a smooth/mild flavor.  The coffee taste isn't strong (on either 10oz or 8oz settings, the flavor just gets more "intense") and it's actually kind of nice for a later evening cup of coffee.  But, of the 3 Donut brands, I prefer it the least.

review/summary: Great Bold Smooth Kup of Coffee
review/text: This is Green Mountain's response to the Coffee People's Donut Shop coffee.  Many people actually confuse the two which isn't difficult to do: donut house and donut shop -- both are extra bold in flavor, and both are excellent.  Since Donut Shop is my favorite, I decided to conduct a taste test between these two rivals.  Side to side they are very similar, very little acid taste, no bitterness which is what I look for in an extra bold roast.  Head to head Donut Shop edged this coffee, Donut House, out by the slightest of margin.  Donut Shop had slightly more body to it but frankly, it took me drinking a half cup of each before I could declare a winner.  This is why I also think this is a 5 star coffee -- excellent choice if you want a simple, great tasting cup of coffee that you will not get sick of.

review/summary: Very Light
review/text: I decided to try a box because Costco carries this and they haven't had my favorite Tully's Kona for a while. It lives up to the "light roast" description and brews one of the lightest (you might also say 'weakest') cups of coffee I've had in any K-cup. Even using two k-cups didn't help much. It's way too light for my tastes; glad I didn't buy the box of 88 at Costco.<br /><br />So, if you like a lightly roasted and somewhat weak cup of coffee, you'd like this. The flavor is good. But, k-cups run a little on the weak side in general and this one is simply too light for me.<br /><br />Amazon did ship fast and had a good price.<br /><br />UPDATE: Some reviews here don't seem to understand the terms being used.<br /><br />"Light Roast" is a description of how long the coffee beans are roasted. Light roaster beans do not have the strong and sometimes bitter flavor of beans that are roasted for longer times, but they retain more of the subtleties of their flavor.  It does produce a `lighter' cup of coffee.<br /><br />"Extra Bold" is a term Keurig/Green Mountain uses to describe a K-cup that has more coffee grounds in it than normal K-cups.  More coffee grounds makes for a stronger cup of coffee. The strength of the coffee also depends on how large a cup you brew.<br /><br />You can have a "light roast" coffee in an "Extra Bold" K-cup, but the result will still be a coffee with a lighter flavor.<br /><br />Personally, I like a medium roast; a nice balance between good coffee flavor and that strong coffee bite.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I get my K-cups either at Amazon (used to be the cheapest) or Costco (is the cheapest). The obvious problem with Costco is the selection, maybe 2 or 3 kinds to choose from. That is why I still buy from amazon occasionally, real nice selection to choose from.  I have had my Keurig for about a year and have tried many different kinds of coffee from most of the companies out there. I found the coffee shop brand at Costco and this has become one of my favorites and was my daily cup. If you have ever shopped at Costco you know that things come and go a lot. That was the case with my donut shop yesterday. IT WAS GONE!! Replaced with donut "house". I figured for .42 a cup I would give it a try. I am not disappointed at all. It is just as good as the donut shop I used to drink. Perhaps ever so slightly less strong, but an excellent cup of coffee, and cant beat the price at Costco. The only thing that is a little confusing on Amazon is the price?? That is really high. Anyway. If you are a donut shop drinker you will love the donut house every bit as much. Don't hesitate to buy it...but make sure you check the price. Great price available form Costco....this week

review/summary: Drinkable, but rather bland, not full-bodied, will not buy again
review/text: I have been a Keurig user for several years, have one at home and one in my office. For at least 4 years I have been using the Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade K-cups, been very happy with them. Recently I saw the Donut House flavor offered at my local warehouse club and it piqued my interest, problem is that the warehouse box contains 80 K-cups, didn't want to buy 80 of something I may not like. So, I picked up an 18-count box at my local Walmart, I'm so glad that I did!<br /><br />First, let me say that I'm not a fan of Starbucks coffee's, I think they are too strong, too bold, too bitter. I like a flavorful, medium roast but full-bodied cup of coffee. The Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade K-cups fit this bill, whenever I would make a cup at my office, everyone would comment, "Wow, that smells so good!", it tasted just as good.<br /><br />I tried the Donut House coffee this morning, no inviting aroma when brewing, very bland in taste, I don't know how they get away with calling this "Bold". It says right on the box, "light roast", I don't know how a "light roast" can be called "Bold"? I was expecting a very full-bodied flavor, but without a bitter after-taste. Well, there was no after-taste, no taste period, just very bland!<br /><br />FYI, I usually use 16 oz. "to go" cups when brewing K-cups, I use 2 K-cups per 16 oz. cup, I brew the first K-cup on the middle button (8 oz. setting), the the second K-cup on the lowest setting (I think it is 6.5 oz. setting), this allows room for a teaspoon of sugar and some half and half to a golden color. I have been doing this for years with my Columbian K-cups and always get a great cup of coffee, did the same with the Donut House blend, drinkable, but not remarkable in any way. I will be sticking with my Columbian Fair Trade blend that never fails me.<br /><br />I will use the remainder of my Donut House K-cups, but I will not buy them again.

review/summary: Pretty delish!
review/text: I'm a big fan of Keurig cups, so I ended up picking a box of this up at Sam's Club the other day to bring to work. (If you have a membership already, this is cheaper there. If not, then this is probably the better deal unless you absolutely want a membership to those types of stores.) It was worth the purchase, in my opinion.<br /><br />Taste-wise, this was pretty nice. I was a little worried about whether or not the cup would be too watery due to the type of machine we use at work (it has a water reservoir that it draws from rather than the one I have at home, where you add your own water), but this brewed up nicely. It was a little mild tasting, so if you're more partial to teas since coffee tastes too harsh then this will be a good alternative. If you're the type that likes the darker roasts, then you'll want to skip this one. (Although be aware that the lighter the roast, the more caffeine the bean has! The darker it is, the longer it's roasted and the more caffeine is roasted out!)<br /><br />I'm fairly happy with this product and I'm pretty psyched that you get so many per box. The smaller boxes are good for individual use, but for larger crowds? You have to buy in bulk just to save money, otherwise you'll go broke.

review/text: This is the best Decaf Coffee on the market.  I have always enjoyed coffee but because of health issues I have been restricted to decaf.  I tried many many other decaf brands and have determined that Donut House is the best.

review/text: I bought 80 of these for $33 from Sam's Club when I got my new Keurig B60 there as well.  After trying all of the coffees in the sampler, I think this is by far the best so far.  It is a nice, medium, very smooth and totally non-bitter cup of coffee.  I like it a lot, but I haven't really even started trying out the 100+ varieties available so we'll say it's the best "so far".  Still, a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: Fantastic decaf - but it's a light roast, not "extra bold"
review/text: This is by far the best decaf I've ever tasted.  It's better than most regular coffee.  But, the picture included here indicates "Extra Bold" and the K-cups I received are Light Roast.  In truth I don't think that Donut House makes an "Extra Bold" decaf.  I would recommend this coffee, but I wouldn't call it "extra bold".  Bold compared to other decafs maybe!

review/summary: Solid cup of coffee
review/text: This coffee is one of the best of the "donut" style brands that are on the market. It is a smooth coffee that has a nice body, and no bitter aftertaste. It is not acidic, and in fact has some notes of sweetness. It is more flavorful than donut shoppe, and better than the timothy's similarly named variety. Highly recommend. Although it is listed as a light roast, I would describe it as almost a medium body coffee.

If your a Starbucks fan don't even waste you money because this coffee doesn't have the smokey or strong taste that Starbucks has. This is lighter and smoother. Other reviewers state it's cheaper at Costco and Sams, and that's true if they have it in stock but at my local Sams Club its hit or miss on what they have in stock at any given timeframe. So to know you can come here and order is a great option.

review/summary: DONUT HOUSE-DONUT SHOP EITHER EXCELLENT CHOICE
review/text: I was up late ordering from Amazon and got the Donut House instead of the Donut Shop because of senioritis!!  When it came, I first thought..."what the h... I did not order this coffee".  After checking my orders, I confirmed that it was me!!! HA!  Anyway, I too did a taste test comparison and can say that I could not tell the difference between them.  Both excellent flavor and body.<br />I have a Saeco Royal Professional espresso machine that I use every morning to make coffee fresh from Italian or French roasted beans.  I hate to admit that I like this Donut House better as a coffee for the lasting taste.  No, I did not stop drinking my morning espresso, I just added a couple of cups of Donut House or Donut Shop..forgot again...what was I saying!!!  Only kidding. 5 Stars!

review/text: ...like many people, I have soft spot for Dunkin' Donuts coffee, which can take the edge of a morning commute or the start of a long road trip. While I was happy when DD recently introduced their own K-Cup varieties, the only place you can get them is in DD stores.<br /><br />Donut House clearly gets the popularity of DD's freshly brewed coffee, which is richly flavored without being overpowered. They tapped into that need with their Light Roast version, which has has much wider availability that the venerable DD store brand.<br /><br />Check prices in brick and mortar stores (especially big box/club stores), where you might be able to do a little better (IF they have it in stock).<br /><br />This is by far the favorite K-cup choice in our house, which never goes a day without drinking coffee.

However, even tho the quality of the product is still there, the last time I received the 80 pack, several of the K-Cups were broken & the coffee missing. Some of them were broken within the box & the coffee was everywhere. That is the reason for the 4 star rating - will order them once more to see if the last order was an anomaly.

review/text: Don't buy this if you like Starbuck's coffee.  I love this because it is mild.  In the past, I bought Green Mountain coffee, but I always added water to dilute its taste.  This is a perfect mild taste.  K-cups are expensive, but these taste good, so it's worth the cost.

review/summary: good flavored decaf
review/text: I purchased this coffee product for my wife.  She hasn't found another decaf k-cup brand that she prefers over this donut house product.  She loves this.  I prefer a deeper, more robust french roast flavor.

review/text: If you own any of the Keurig K-Cup Brewers then you should definitely get this package. Its filled with 24 count K-Cups for your Keurig. Get a nice cup of coffee fast. They also have other flavors but this is for the Regular which we bought for ours. Nothing better in the morning than a nice fresh cup of coffee and I love the taste! Its not just a generic bland coffee blend. Please try!

review/summary: Graet Cup of Coffee
review/text: This blend has got me hooked. I was an avid DD fan but 11.99 for 14 cups. I even was grinding my own DD and using the adapter filters. Definitely cheaper. Still the convenience of the k-cup is nice.  Then I tried this blend. Not only is it comparible in taste...its actually better. Much better.  Sorry DD.  Since each even cheaper in quanitity I wonder how fresh the cups stay?  In either case this is an awesome blend

review/text: Too strong for a medium brew, there is much better.  Coffee People Donut shop is my favorite unflavored coffee.  Also, about 15 cups out of a 50 cup box popped the seal when brewed, this caused grounds to go in the coffee.  I will probably not buy this coffee again.

Darker roasts aren't healthy for you - they say light roasts are much better.  I won't give up yet, but this definitely isn't the one I can drink every day.  I found it bitter - a very odd taste.

review/summary: Neither light or very good :-(
review/text: When I bought this coffee I was expecting a light-roast coffee with smooth body and great flavor as could be found in some donut shops in days gone by.  For me, this doesn't fulfill either.  This coffee should be described as bold, there is nothing light about it.  Forget about smooth body, instead it has an acidity and bitterness that I found unpleasant.  I'm still debating just tossing it out or letting it collect dust in the event I need to use it if I'm out of all other k-cups.<br /><br />This coffee made it to my "Do not buy again" list.

review/summary: VERY LIGHT!
review/text: I mistakenly grabbed this Donut HOUSE blend at Costco thinking it was the Donut SHOP blend of k-cup (by Coffee People).  I realized it wasn't Donut SHOP the first time I made a cup.  It was REALLY light - basically colored water, very little flavor if made on the recommended 8 oz brew size.  Not much better on a lower setting either.  If you like a very, very mild coffee, then this is for you.  I'm not a fan of strong coffee, but this was WAY to mild and I'll be making sure I'm getting the Coffee People Donut SHOP coffee rather than Donut HOUSE in the future!

review/summary: Good product, but...
review/text: The product is fine, but it is not similar to Brazilian Japanese style peanuts neither in taste nor in the type of peanut. This product tastes sweet and very crunchy and uses Viriginia (large) peanuts. Brazilian Japanese style peanuts are salty (due to the use of soy sauce) and use "Spanish" (small) peanuts.

review/text: I purchased this food coloring hoping it would create black frosting. I read several reviews on this and other websites which suggested I use chocolate icing (as white icing + black food coloring= gray frosting) but this product did not darken the chocolate at ALL. I ended up using over half for one cake and still decided the color wasn't right. It was still obviously brown. Perhaps my expectations were too high.

review/summary: If Only it Didn't have BHT...
review/text: This is a delicious cereal I enjoy with or without milk.  The big problem, and why I don't buy it...they add BHT (a preservative with questionable effects on the body).<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Crunchy, holds up to milk well getting soggy slowly.<br />- Great flavor, not too sweet, but sweet enough to be flavorful.<br />- Makes a tasty snack when eaten dry, by itself.<br />- Packed with whole grains, which I try to get a lot of in my diet.<br />- No high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Contains BHT<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION<br />This is a very flavorful cereal.  Reminds me of Honey Nut Cheerios in a different form.  The flavor is similar.  Nicely sweetened without being over the top, and a great crunch.  Does make a good breakfast to start the day, and I've also eaten it dry as a snack.  Good snack in the car, at work, or wherever.  If they remove the BHT, I'll start buying it again.
