review/summary: tasty Maybe beneficial
review/text: My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two.<br />At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it.

review/summary: Menopause Relief
review/text: I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.

review/summary: Mild sweet tea
review/text: I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.

I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day.

review/text: this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to<br />go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,<br />yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not<br />set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks

review/summary: Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!
review/text: I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously, my experience made me a believer!<br /><br />I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.  And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas.

review/text: I use it to help jump start my weight loss regime. I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all. It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck

review/summary: No more breast milk!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply.

Though sage is most commonly used in cooking, sage tea has been shown to boost alertness and mood, while decreasing anxiety, I was told.<br /><br />I find it very soothing.

The tea is caffeine free so I normally drink it in the afternoon or evening as I still need the caffeine coffee provides in the morning.<br /><br />This is a great product and I will most likely order it again.

review/text: We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.

review/summary: Recommended by herbalist--love it.
review/text: We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.

review/summary: Red Raspberry Leaf Tea
review/text: I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.

I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot.

I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.

At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

review/summary: Light flavored tea
review/text: I got this tea because it is supposed to help with PMS and supposedly helps "prepare" the uterus for conception. I figured it can't hurt, so why not? I think this tea is very light flavored. I usually put some honey in it and it goes down great.<br /><br />As for the rest, I've only been using it (3 times a day) for the past 7 days and haven't gone a full cycle yet, so I don't know if it really does work for PMS yet or not.

review/text: I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

review/text: My mother-in-law recommended this tea to me to help me naturally alleviate my menstrual cramps. I have to warn that the tea doesn't "kick in" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it.

review/text: I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells.

review/summary: Fenugreek Seed Tea
review/text: I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

Drinking Fenugreek tea, taking L-Arginine supplements and getting a good nights' sleep (6 hour min.). Well, I am going to give it a shot. This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad. It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually. I wasn't able to find this tea in any local supermarkets but here it is on Amazon. Seems they have everything!

review/text: Tea comes in bags inside a large foil lined pouch.  There are 2 bags 'attached', and you peel them apart to use one.  They are not individually wrapped, and they do not have strings.  Strong flavor, great price.

review/summary: Sage Tea helps with night sweats
review/text: I have one cup a day and it really decreases my night sweats. I'm in amazement at how much it helps!<br /><br />The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/summary: Genuinely good cookies for a variety of dietary restrictions
review/text: Jo-Sef Square Cinnamon Cookies, Gluten Free<br /><br />Genuinely good cookies for a variety of dietary restrictions 4*<br /><br />Though the package highlights the "gluten free" aspect of these cookies made with rice and soy flours, they will also provide a pleasant treat for those with a variety of other restrictions:  they are "processed in a dedicated gluten-free & nut free facility," lactose/dairy free, casein free, egg free, wheat and corn free .. plus, are vegan and have no preservatives!  One almost wonders what is left ;-).  They are also low in sodium, have no cholesterol and a smidgin of fiber.  On the other hand, there is a fair amount of saturated fat (4g in a 3-cookie, 1 oz, serving) and a fair amount of sugar (9g / serving).<br /><br />This were mis-categorized in the diabetic treat section of a market and I picked some up for a relative but got to keep them for myself when we noticed the sugar content.  Her loss, my gain, because these are actually quite tasty regardless of dietary goodness.  To my taste, there is a good amount of cinnamon -- neither overpowering nor the mere "hint" detected by reviewer S. Campbell (and I like strongly flavored foods) -- and a distinct sweetness.  The texture is excellent, with a crisp bite and fine, but not powdery, granularity.  The sugar cookie comparison used by the other reviewer is close, but these are intriguingly different, perhaps due to the gluten-free flour used.<br /><br />Definitely recommended, if not get out on the street corners and evangelize wonderful, and no doubt a welcome treat for those whose restrictions prevent regular pastries.  They do seem a mite expensive, even at the lower price in the brick-and-mortar store where purchased.

The 8oz can is just the right size for my lunch box each day.  Plenty of fiber for your diet and the natural juice is so sweet.  I do not own a car so buying by the case is so convenient.

review/text: Ummm.. I open the pop top can -- then I eat one or two chunks -- then I drink the pineapple juice and sloowly finish off the rest of the delectable chunks. Yes I am eating right out of the can -- very informally - and there is usually an opened can of chicken chunks next to me at my hidden cubicle at work where I eat my lunch. Chicken and pineapple -- to me, a great informal lunch. Of course when I am home, everything gets mixed in a pot, with cooked white rice and heated to perfection. Or maybe the Dole Pineapple Chunks are slated for a cake, upside-down or right-side up -- Everything (almost everything, maybe not liverwurst) goes better with Dole Pineapple. They are always, fresh, juicy, and tasty.

review/text: These pineapple chunks are quite tasty--sweet and flavorful in their own juice. I think it is a fair price, too. I like having a stock of these small cans because they are the right size for me to use by myself for two servings. The cans have pop-tops, so they are a good portable snack. Doubtless many people would find them to be the right size for a single serving, but for me, they are just a bit too big for that. I like to blend them with Greek yogurt, soy milk, chia seeds and ice for a super-nutrious smoothy pick me up.

review/summary: Product can have Bad(Sour) Cans
review/text: My cats will jump hoops to get this treat.  However, after using for over 4 years, I have found you can get a 'bad' can of treat.  When opened, immediately, the animals will sniff and walk away (and the smell is more oily and unpleasant).  I purchase in bulk, and the last time out of 12 cans purchased 3 were bad (and had to be tossed).  I spoke with a Kitty Kaviar representative, and they asked if they had gotten wet, which they had not; and they referred me back to the distributor for possible compensation. Luckily, the distributor I purchased from gave me credit. I have a friend who has had the same experience (buying the product local and not on line).  This inconsistency in the product is a problem with the treat.  When it is good I have very happy felines.

review/summary: Add K.K. to your cats food!!!
review/text: I have a VERY finicky cat. If she only knew how much money I spend on the high quality food she is eating (naturesvariety.com). Anyway, she was losing a little weight and wasn't eating as much as she should. I mix K.K. in with her food and she gobbles it right up. I feed her N.V. raw medallions  mixed with chicken baby food which has a more wet consistency and it blends all the way through the food so she eats it all. She is getting back to her "fighting weight"....it your cat is a finicky eater, I promise this will do the trick. Great product. No expiration date and doesnt need refrigeration. Its pretty "flakey" so I put it in a food chopper so a little goes a long way. The cats only need to smell it in the food and they will attack. Sprinkle a little on the top to get them interested and they will dig in. Aloha

I ended up going to the store to get some new cans since my cat wouldn't eat from these ones and the stores cans were great and my cat was happy and eating again. In fact, the consistency and color seemed to be different and better from the store bought. More flakey and less chunky than this last order.

You can find something similar at Asian markets, but it's probably too salty for cats.

review/summary: Yum, yum, yum!!! Gimmee some!!! Kitty Kaviar, that is!!!
review/text: Ever since I discovered this product at a small, independent pet store on the Upper West Side in New York City some years ago, my cats have been wild for it. Of course, the ones who enjoyed it then have long since passed on, but my current five are ecstatic whenever they see me take out the big round container. When I first found it in that pet store (an open container was sitting on a counter), I bought some for a dear friend who lives about 2-3 blocks from the store. When I sent in my six-pack order last month, I knew that I'd have to send me friend one of those packs. Her orange tabby cat is gone now, too, but her new kitten, whom she adopted even though - or perhaps because - he has only one eye, loves Kitty Kaviar as much as all of mine do. Great product. And, I even received an extra container with a similar product, free of charge (and a surprise to me).

review/text: My Birmans love it! They are so anxious to get it that they get up to their feet in order to catch my hand! It is the best treat I have bought so far and I will continue giving it to my animals as the vet also told me that the fish fats are ideal for their skin and hair. Also I use it as a reward when medicine has to be administered; this way, my cats know there is a special treat waiting for them, if they are good kids. In other words, this treat has saved me!
