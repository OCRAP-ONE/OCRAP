review/summary: Entirely too runny
review/text: Purees are not supposed to be this thin.  What a mess!!  I make most of the food for my twins, but bought a few organic pouches to try while we were on vacation for Memorial Day.  I had an assortment of Plum Organics, Earth's Best and a few Ella's Organics.  The Plum are a much more normal consistency AND taste better all around.  I mixed this with Brown Cow cream top plain yogurt (as I have done with all the other fruit pouches I brought for the weekend). This particular packet was so runny it was like spoon feeding them a bottle! Can you say disaster?! Won't buy again.

review/text: Organic food pouches are wonderful. They are easy to carry and to eat (children can manipulate them on their own as soon as they can hold things with both hands). My child enjoyed Ella's kitchen pouches a lot till she was almost 18 months old.  She seemd to like apples+bananas the best.

review/summary: "Snack Pouch" FAVORITE
review/text: That is what these are called in our house.  After naps each little tike gets one from the fridge and they think it's a smoothy.<br />I give them all sorts of fruit and veggie mix flavors and they never fail me.  It's the incentive to get the nap in there too.<br /><br />I recommend putting them in the fridge, just popping the top of and handing it over to any baby who's done with their bottle.<br />I started giving them directly to the kids at age 13 months.  A bit messy for the first week, but the youngest is 15 months now and<br />she knows exactly what to do with her "sak ouwt"

review/summary: Perfect for Picky Toddlers!
review/text: When my son was an infant he willingly ate a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Now that he's a toddler he refuses almost all fresh fruits and vegetables, even the ones that he used to love.  I use these to sneak healthy food into him!  I keep some organic baby food pouches in the car, so that I always have a healthy snack on hand for him.  He loves them!<br /><br />Note that these aren't as sweet as some of the other organic baby food pouches (such as Happy Tot's Spinach, Mango, and Pear).  If I give my son a sweeter pouch first, and then this pouch, he refuses this one.  If you think your child will eat more than one pouch, offer this sweet potato/pumpkin pouch first!  I am so grateful for these!

review/summary: Great portable baby food!
review/text: My son is now one, and looooves these little pouches. I can't even go through the baby food aisle at the grocery store without him seeing these and crying for one. I love the packaging because it is so easy for him to hold and eat off the spout. Plus, these are great to put in his diaper bag for snacks when we're out running errands or to feed him at a restaurant. He loves all the flavors of these, there are other brands out there that he didn't like and when I tried them they were not very good. I have tried these and they are very tasty, which I was surprised because some of the combos don't sound like they would taste good (spinach, apple, rutabaga?). I am from Dallas and I get them from a grocery store here called Central Market and they normally sell them at less than $2 but will have sales where you can get them at around $1, so that is when I stock up. The product is excellent, but I think the price you pay on Amazon is very high compared to other places where you can get a better price.

review/text: I have twin 14 month old girls and they have been eating Ella's Organic fruit/veggie pouches since they were about 4 months old. They LOVE them and they are a great snack to take on the road or outside. While I would prefer for the girls to eat actual fruit and veggies, they are going through a picky stage right now and these pouches are the next best thing. We buy them in bulk and can't keep up with the demand from our girls.

review/text: It is hard to get my 9 month old to eat vegetables, but luckily she likes this blend! As another review mentioned, it is pretty runny but I just thicken it up with rice cereal. I'm a little torn on what I think of packages like this - I am glad they are BPA free, and they are convenient for when we're out and about, but in general I prefer glass containers that we can recycle or reuse.

review/summary: Baby loves this food!
review/text: This food is not as smooth as some of the others and is a mixture of 4 foods, so I didn't start feeding it to my baby until he was 6-7 months old.  He's 9 months old now and still loves it, and I think it's better now that it isn't as smooth.  I could see feeding him this for awhile longer alongside solids or as a snack.  The only downside is the price, but I guess it's not much more than other pouches.

review/summary: Looks and smells gross, but my baby wouldn't stop eating it!
review/text: Our pediatrician recommended this flavor combination when we first started solids because it has 120% of daily iron needs.  Well, when I sat down to feed it to my baby, all I could was, wow, this is so gross!  It looks pretty much the same way going in as it does coming out, if you know what I mean.  To my surprise, my picky eater gobbled it up!  She ate more of this than any other baby food flavor we had offered.  A 2-3oz package of anything else was lasting two days, but she ate almost the whole 3.5oz package of this in one sitting.  I did taste it, and the apples make it sweet and appetizing (and I really do not like spinach).  We've had more success with Ella's Kitchen than any other brand, but this flavor especially has been great.  Looks gross, smells gross, sounds gross, but I say, give it a try.

review/summary: Helpful for kids with special needs, too
review/text: My son is 8 but due to his disability is on a very low calorie diet and has issues chewing many low calorie foods such as raw veggies.  These packets are a fun way for him to enjoy a low calorie snack when we are on the go (only 35-40 calories for many of the packets).  He loves the taste and of course there is no worry about choking hazards.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because they are extremely pricey, even at the lowest price I could find it really adds up.

review/text: When my 4 month old son sees these brightly colored pouches he sits straight up in his high chair and starts to get excited. All the flavors are really yummy. ... I've tried everything that he's eaten at this point.<br /><br />I really like that these have no additives... They didnt even add water. Just pure organic fruit and vegetable pur&eacute;e. I figure that he's going to have so many processed food options in the future that I might as well give him the best I can now.<br /><br />I purchased the Boon Spoons (got a 3 pack of the 2-spoon sets from the big T for less than a 2 pack here on amazon) and they work perfectly with these pouches too. Very convenient to take on the go.<br /><br />I continue to purchase these pouches, though I usually buy a couple individual packs from T before buying the 7 packs here on Amazon so I can make sure he likes them.

review/text: I have been buying Ella since my son was 6 months old. Once I moved back to the States I was pleased to find the Ella product here. I was also buying Gerber Organic and then one day I studied the label and realized that only Ella was truly just pure veg and fruit whereas the other organic baby food as other random things to help the shelf life. Ella is worth the price and is so easy to mix in with chicken or fish to make it easier for your little one. Although my son is now 16months, I still use Ella when I am short on time and don't have time to make fresh veg or fruit.

review/text: These little pouches are great for toddlers who refuse to eat their vegetables in the conventional way. My son started getting picky around 18 months and I was on the verge of desperation when I found these at BRU. (They are also carried at a certain big box store that has a bulls eye logo.) Yes, they are marketed for babies, and are almost two bucks a pop, but my son ALWAYS finishes these pouches, which is more than I can say for most things he eats, and I feel much better knowing he ingested something green! Yay for Ella's kitchen! Oh. and I also recommend the pumpkin version. Super yummy!

review/text: I have an 11 month and 3.5 year old. These pouches make for a great yummy snack. My kids love to eat them right out of the pouch. My older child eats her whole veggies and also these pouches. My baby, is not a huge veggie fan like my eldest.. she loves these however. When I cook for the baby if I don't hide the veggies well, she will reject the meal. So, when I can't get my baby to eat the organic veggies I have made or when I need a quick snack while shopping or out and about, Ella's takes great care of us! Def a must have. Oh, I just give my baby the whole tube and she sucks it all out.. great for the baby who had always refused me feeding her.

review/text: My son is almost 18 months old and these are great for healthy snacks on the go. They are a great combination of fruits and vegetables without all the extra water and junk that comes in other baby food.  It's like a special treat for my little guy and I'm happy he's eating something healthy.  Only complaint is I wish they weren't so expensive.

review/text: I just started buying this product. It is not available in local stores. I went to Target last Sunday and saw these so I decided to gave it a try. My baby happen to love these as much as Happy Baby products. I am surprised to see it here on Amazon. So next time I will buy it from here. It tastes great. My baby loves it. Yeah it is kind of expensive but if your child loves it then I would buy it for the child. They do go on sale too. If you have WIC ( Women , Infant and Children) You can buy these from Target Because only Target carry these here. I am not sure if Amazon accepts WIC.  Over all a great product I would recommend it.

review/text: Knorr leek soup mix makes the best chip and veggie dip; better than French onion! You just mix a packet of mix with 1 pint sour cream, stir, and let sit a couple of hours. Completely addictive. However, it's hard to find in grocery stores, so I turn to Amazon and buy boxes of the stuff. Perfect service, good expiration dates.<br /><br />BTW, for the low-fat version, whip up cottage cheese and a little milk in the blender until it's the consistency of sour cream and use that with the Knorr mix instead. Really good!

review/summary: Novel snack, tasty, but...
review/text: I got hooked on candy-coated fennel seeds when I first tried them through a purchase I made with an online Indian cooking supply store. They were delicate and delish and addictive. I finished them up and then I bought theses packages of fennel seeds to stock up, also from India.  They are good, but apparently all sugar-coated fennel seeds are not created equally. The candy coating on these is much thicker and because of this, they are like little rocks to chew on, VERY crunchy, borderline "hard" crunchy. You can visually see the difference in the size of the individual seeds from the two different purchases; it's not my imagination. It isn't helping me any that I am going thru costly dental issues for the past year, so I am more sensitive now than ever about what I'm chewing on. The packaging is very nice, though; they have very user-friendly, slide-lock tops, very secure, nothing will come out. I was impressed with that.  When it's time to replenish these, however, as I eventually will, I will seek out the ones that I tried first and preferred. I will use these as little giftables since I have five bags of them left!

review/text: These sugar coated fennel seeds are much more tasty than the ones I originally became enamored with from nutsonline.com.  These seeds are very tiny and the coating is delicate so a very easy and tasty mouth feel.  They are like "Good and Plenty" candies only all grown up.  I would highly recommend.<br /><br />Update:  I think the company might have gotten some other kind of seeds mixed in.  I keep thinking I taste possibly cumin seeds, possibly others.  For sure, not all of the seeds are fennel.  It spoils the taste a bit, but still a good after dinner snack.

But who's ever heard of a tan velvet cake? But the cost of the tiny bottles of red food coloring sold at grocery stores adds over $5 to the cost of each cake. So what are you to do? Get this big bottle and make lots of cakes for a fraction of the cost. A feast for the eyes and the mouth. Enjoy! Mmmm!

review/text: Orbit's Sweetmint gum has a very unique flavor that almost reminds me of mint chocolate.  It's definitely not too sweet of a flavor, and you'll feel like you're chewing mint gum still.  The best way I can describe the flavor is a toned-down mint; the sweetness is noticeable but not overpowering.  I'm a fan of Orbit gum because after trying everything else out there, the flavor really does last the longest out of all the gum brands.  If you're looking to try a new gum flavor then you should give this a shot.

We chose to add alfalfa into our products because of all the amazing benefits from it. We harvest the alfalfa leaves for our greens. Alfalfa is one of the world's deepest roots plants absorbs many trace minerals and nutrients from the soil. It's root structure that can grow up to 20 ft. deep, letting it absorb minerals in the sub-soil that many plants can never reach. It also contains all essential amino acids and is a great source of Vitamins A, D E and K. The alfalfa leaf also contains:<br /><br />. Calcium- bone and tooth formation, muscle contractions, heartbeat.<br />. Phosphorus- needed for normal bone and tooth structure. Interrelated<br />with action of calcium and Vitamin D. Improves nourishment of nerve and tissue.<br />. Silicon Magnesium- constipation, steadies the nerves, has protective<br />effect on skin and body, stimulates brain function<br /><br />To add to that, we don't produce or incorporate ANY alfalfa seeds or sprouts into our products.  The negative info you've likely seen only refers to the seeds or sprouts.  Whole Leaf alfalfa has long been revered for it's incredible green leafy vegetable properties and incredible trace minerals.  There isn't any controversy about it that I've ever heard of.

review/summary: A Visit to the Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

review/text: This tea blooms into a very realistic looking sea anemone.  I use it in a large Pilsner Glass, so the anemone opens full.  You could use a wide bottomed wine glass too.  You just have to wait a while for the glass to cool so it is drinkable without burning your hand.  This tea can be soaked over and over, I got eight glasses out of one anemone, so it is pretty economical, you could drink this all day, with the flavor only getting lighter after the fifth glass or so.

review/summary: Love my Morning Joe....
review/text: Well, I don't know anything about the Gold Coast coffee issue but I know I've liked Morning Joe as soon as I found out about it and tried it.  Even though my favorites were Verona and Italian Roast, Morning Joe quickly became my favorite.  Unfortunately, it has been discontinued in all the grocery stores in my area.  With the price increases in coffee, I think this 6-pack is a decent value.  Hopefully the coffee itself is not being discontinued.  (I still drink Verona as well.)  :-)

review/summary: Morning Joe is the same as the old Gold Coast
review/text: I was skeptical at first when Starbucks started calling Gold Coast morning joe (lower case on purpose) but after drinking a couple pounds now I am completely convinced it is the same and just as great as the old Gold Coast.  I'm been drinking Gold Coast for several years now and it is the only ground coffee I stock at home.  Up to now I've always purchased it at the store but am switching to Amazon since it is about 30% less expensive and I just signed up for Amazon Prime.  My only concern is that most vendors who sell Gold Coast on Amazon don't seem to honor Amazon Prime.

review/summary: Absolutely Refreshing
review/text: Saw this in my Hotel Mini-bar and gave the Apple Pear a try. It was absolutely delicious! Really refreshing and lightly flavored, not super sweet with that aspertame-bite like so many flavored waters have.  This stuff was just great after my long flight and cab ride.  I actually drank 2 bottles of it in the hour I was there, trying the Cucumber Lemongrass next, and it was even better than the apple-pear.<br /><br />Love the bottles, too, they're shaped like an old-fashioned flask.<br /><br />I've looked for this in stores and haven't found it, but thank goodness for Amazon, they have everything.<br /><br />Really great product, very sophisticated and delicious flavor.

review/summary: Interesting tastes; good variety
review/text: This was a nice starter pack containing all of Icio's water flavors.  I found the Lychee Watermelon to be very refreshing without being too sweet- this was probably my favorite.  The Apple Pear was more apple than pear, but I liked it too.  The Peach Ginger was much too strong for me.  Personally, the Cucumber Lemongrass tasted like grass and dirt-- I couldn't even stand to finish it.  I would order the Lychee Watermelon and Apple Pear only next time.  As far as the packing, a co-worker commented that it looked like I was drinking liquor from a flask instead of a bottled water.

review/summary: Creamy Garlic Sauce-Another View
review/text: This is an excellent commercial version of aioli and makes an interesting dip for vegetables-as well as for more traditional uses. I have made aioli from scratch using olive oil and hand whisking and find the Benedicta version to be lighter-a bit thicker but having an appropriate intense garlic and lemony taste. It can be thinned out  with milk or cream before use if desired. Personally, I wold not bother making aioli from scratch for most uses but would rely on this product.

review/summary: Best"oven fried" chicken ever!
review/text: We just love the flavor of this breading but don't always want it deep fried. What I do is first preheat the oven to 400 degrees and then spread about 4-6 tablespoons or so of peanut oil on a release foil lined cookie sheet, with low sides. Then wet and bread chicken with Sylvia's mix according to package directions. (I don't always use the egg though.) Place skin side of chicken pieces down onto the oiled cookie sheet and bake in oven for 30 minutes. Then turn chicken over and bake for another 30 minutes or until done. It tastes just as great as the deep fried, but without the added grease and mess. Easy cleanup and oh, so good!<br /><br />I won't use any other chicken breading except Sylvia's.

I haven't had much luck w/ just wetting w/ water, then breading the chicken so I dip in an egg first & then put the mix & the chicken in a plastic bag.  I then shallow fry in canola oil just to get it crispy, then bake for 20 min.  Perfect every time.  I use separated wings for this.

review/text: I've been using this mix for several years now. I always bought it at the grocery store and when I moved to a different state, could not find it anymore. Fortunately, I purchased about 20 bags of it before I moved and it lasted a long time.<br /><br />Once I ran out, I hit the computer to see where I could purchase it and lo and behold, it was on Amazon. And it was even cheaper than what I used to pay at the grocery store!! This mix can not be any easier to use or, any better than making it from scratch because that's what I did for years until I found this through my mother in law. I'll never use anything else. I use it for chicken tenders as well as regular fried chicken!

review/summary: The Best Chicken Fry Mix I've Ever Found
review/text: Sylvia's Chicken Fry Mix is simply the best! My husband and I once found it by chance at a local grocery store, and absolutely loved it.  Unfortunately, the store stopped carrying it soon after, and we were never able to find it again at any other area grocery stores.  Rumor had it that if I drove to the South Side, I may have been able to get it... but that was not a drive I wanted to endure.<br /><br />So, one day I had an amazing idea: "Hmmm... Amazon is a place where I can find almost anything, and since I'm a Prime member, I can get free second day shipping."  I gave it a shot and there it was! My day was made!<br /><br />Now I have a nine pack of Sylvia's Chicken Fry that should last us for quite some time, and the product is as great as it ever was!

review/text: I ordered this because someone said something about it being better than kfc.<br /><br />It's completely unlike the KFC flavor, and nowhere near as good. I really like some of Sylvia's other products but this one wasn't a home run. I ended up giving several packages to a neighbor. I knew I'd never use them. It just doesn't have "it" when it comes to the seasoning combination. I just got Kentucky Kernels seasoned flour by Hodgkins (spelling?) Mill and I love it, closest prepackaged seasoned flour to KFC yet.

The only other confection that can compare are the kinder brand milk chocolates, but those can be too sweet; these, however, are just about perfect.

review/summary: Much Better Than Powdered Mixes
review/text: This product is basically the spices that you would put into pho broth if you were making it from scratch.  You use this instead of going out to the market looking for whole spices.  Each box contains 4 spice pouches (basically big tea bags).  You use it by cooking up some plain chicken broth or stock and adding the tea bag to the cooking broth.  After it's steeped for a while you can taste to see if the spice is strong enough for you, if not, leave it in longer.  Once you're done with it, you just remove it from the broth.  I like it much better than the powdered mixes, because I find that they are usually much too sweet and/or salty for my taste without providing enough spice.  It also allows you to control how weak or strong of broth you use.  I really liked the pho broth that resulted from this and highly recommend it.
