review/summary: Not bad, but expected more for the price
review/text: Noodle was good quality, but that was to be expected for this price range.  I found the warehouse club brands to be much better buy.  For people with "normal" tolerance of hot food, I would recommend using half packet of this power in the noodle first, at most.

review/summary: Tasty Ramen with a kick
review/text: The first time I tried this I thought it was very tasty and very spicy. Now, after my 4th package, it is just very tasty and almost not spicy enough!  It definitely grew on me - very delicious and addictive!<br />I DO wish there was a low sodium version however; 1040mg of sodium in 1 pkg is just too much. (Are you listening Nong Shim?) Something with this much spice and flavor does not need as much salt so I will definitely have to eat them sparingly, if I can resist the temptation!

review/summary: Don't buy these if you want to keep getting ramen from the grocery store for 10 for $1...
review/text: This is the best ramen noodles that I have ever had. The soup is very flavorful and fairly spicy. They are way better than the kind you get from most normal grocery stores and I don't have any asian markets nearby. I really like having the little vegetable packet too, it adds a great textural element. My only complaint about this is that the soup is very strong and very salty so I usually don't eat the soup that is left over after the noodles are gone, but I really don't need the salt anyway so I am still giving it 5 stars.

review/summary: Whoa, I Think Our Kids Have Been Deprived
review/text: I don't have a lot against these fast cook noodles, except that they never were intended as a quality product - and I think it's a little too late to start now.  I eat these - I always have some around and Yes, I bought these very ones right here on Amazon.  I keep them around mostly for a quick lunch ramen fix when I'm in the mood - and sometimes I use them as the noodle base for a quick stir fry - I'll admit, they're good for 100s of things, none of which are as good as when I make them the right way.<br /><br />I just have two thoughts right now -no, that's a lie, I've got lots more than two - but I try to limit myself - OK, thought #1: whenever I do have these 'ramen' type noodles (these are not udon noodles, these are ramen), my fridge always has lots of leftovers that would blow these out of the water - I'm simply in the mood, and besides, whenever I eat these, I add lots of other goodies, such as veggies and meats, and other 'helpers' - I don't ever remember eating this plain like it comes out of the pack - I can't imagine that that'd be good at all - this stuff needs some help!<br /><br />Thought #2: I can't help thinking that we've raised a generation of kids that have been cheated, when it comes to the introduction of ethnic food tastes - I think far too many moms who may have been well intentioned, simply marveled at how quickly their kids took to this 'foreign' food back in 80s and 90s - and since it was like, 10 or 15 cents a bag back then, hey, why go any further?<br /><br />This stuff was invented to be fast and cheap - and I'm sure its success far surpassed the expectations of its creator - but then, I'm sure he knew what real ramen tasted like, and this was never going to challenge that stuff!  And I wonder what will happen when the kids who grew up on Top Ramen get their first real taste of  real fresh ramen?  Kinda like an epiphany, I think.<br /><br />What we have here at best is an improved version of Top Ramen - it may be better than Top Ramen, but when I eat it, I still think of how much better the real stuff is than this.

I bought it specifically to feed to my infant son - not for food allergies, but to give him a variety of foods.  My only complaint is it doesn't last very long - it is a pretty small jar.<br /><br />And in case you're thinking of trying it, it doesn't freeze well.  I tried a little bit in baby food cubes and when thawed, it was too firm to thin out again to feed to baby.

review/text: Ok, we all know people have different taste levels. You all know the people who grab the salt shaker and empty it over their already salty meal. I'm sensitive to flavorings and with some flavored coffee I just fill my cup almost to the top with unflavored and add a little flavored at the end. This Melitta is like that. WOW. I am totally unable to drink this package undiluted with regular coffee, it would have to be strongly diluted. The flavor is INTENSE and I think the cause of some reviewers saying the coffee is bitter or burnt. I don't think it's the coffee, I think it's the flavoring. I might try it later just adding a little to unflavored coffee but right now I have to rinse and rinse my mouth, which is still tingling/burning from the vanilla flavor. No coffee flavor got through for me.<br /><br />I do drink flavored coffee and like it, just can't recommend this brand. Oh, and the bag!<br />I was very careful trying to open it but ended up making holes so had to get the scissors and cut it.<br />I'm giving it two stars instead of one because I haven't tried adding a little to regular coffee.

review/summary: Solid coffee flavor but bitter -- nothing special here
review/text: There were some surprises in this coffee for me. I made two pots, one a little stronger than the other, just so I could try it at different strength levels. Both pots conveyed the same essential characteristics. I poured cups for both myself and a coffee-loving friend, just to help ameliorate personal preferences, but we still quickly reached common conclusions with little discussion.<br /><br />First the vanilla... this brew doesn't really manifest a vanilla flavor. That aspect is more of an essence that quickly fills the room during brewing and which the nose encounters as one tastes it. I was actually expecting a significant vanilla flavor but I couldn't detect it much in the coffee itself, which was fine with me. It was a pleasant aroma.<br /><br />As for the coffee, I was quite surprised at the product page description which particularly boasts *no bitterness*, because this coffee conveys an edge like a wood rasp. I thought it was among the most bitter of all the premium gourmet coffees that I've tasted over the years. Is this due to the presence of *quakers* (underdeveloped beans which yield undesireable flavors)? I cannot say since this coffee is pre-ground. I can say that I ultimately dumped in some pre-warmed Half-and-Half to tone it back and I could still detect the bitterness, although not as prevalently.<br /><br />This brew wasn't hateful but it's not a coffee that I'd be interested in drinking in the future. But do not fail to try it based solely on what I have had to say about it. Lord only knows that the flavor of coffee is one of the most subjectively preferential beverages on the market so it might suit you just fine -- but not me.

review/summary: Decent coffee but Melitta's Hazelnut is better
review/text: I enjoyed this coffee, but I'd say it's on the better side of decent.  I also sampled Melitta's Hazelnut Cafe Collection coffee recently and I preferred that variety.  There is a slightly odd, artificial taste in this coffee that I'm not thrilled with.<br /><br />To be clear, this is not bad coffee by any stretch.  It's fresh and seems to have a respectable caffeine content.  It is much, much better than a flavored coffee by Gevalia that I tried awhile back.  Certainly, you might like this a lot, as the vanilla taste, while not great, is not objectionable and the aroma is nice.<br /><br />I think that decent is a fair description and I'd give it a 3 star rating.  It's not a very expensive item, so if you're not sure, give it a try and decide for yourself.

There is too much glue holding it together and you need scissors to open it unless you want to be sweeping up finely ground coffee from every nook and cranny in your kitchen when it explodes upon trying to pull it apart.

review/summary: Not bad at all
review/text: I recently tried and really liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3GC">Melitta Cafe Collection Hazelnut Creme Brulee Ground Coffee, 11-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>, and since French Vanilla is my favorite among flavored coffees I was eager to try their Parisian Vanilla ground coffee. I had mixed feelings on tasting it (though when it comes to flavors and coffee opinions can be very subjective.) Like the other Melitta coffee bags, this one was a bear to open.<br /><br />The flavor was not overpowering, as is the case with many other flavored coffee offerings. Most importantly the quality of the coffee itself is really quite good. The coffee was very smooth and lacked bitterness. Note their instructions and aim for 2 tablespoons per six ounces of coffee (not per 12-oz mug) or it will be weak.<br /><br />For my tastes the resulting flavor was a bit on the artificial side. It did not taste as much like vanilla I've had from other sources. That said, there were a few other positive factors about the coffee. First, both my wife and daughter independently walked in the room and said "Wow, it smells wonderful in here!"  The aroma is indeed nice. Second, I made a large iced coffee for my wife with the Melitta Vanilla coffee and it turned out very nicely. (The expectation there was more for a refreshing flavored cold drink more than on the coffee taste itself.)<br /><br />If you're not a fan of flavored coffees, or shy away from them because of an artificial taste, this won't change your mind. If you sometimes like flavored coffee or like vanilla, it's worth trying, keeping in mind tastes are very subjective.

review/summary: Average, medium, vanilla blend.
review/text: Overall, this is very decent coffee. The smell when you open the bag is very strong, but the vanilla flavor of the brewed cup is mild. (Ok, it smelled BAD, like too strong fake flavor... but this didn't affect the brewed result as badly as one might suspect.) I think you'd call this a "balanced" blend... it is not very acidic or bitter with a medium color and is both fairly mellow and smooth in flavor.<br /><br />Good for a middle-of-the-road cup of coffee to be enjoyed any time of the day. Certainly not my favorite and could use more flavor, but still a good choice for those who enjoy a milder brew.<br /><br />I'd say: Worth giving a try.

review/summary: For the Coffee Hound
review/text: I just received this product that I gave to someone who is a genuine coffee hound.  While I am not a coffee drinker, I had the recipient give an honest, objective statement about it.<br /><br />That person said that the aroma was "alluring and enticing" and that the coffee was "as smooth as high quality leather."  This observation was followed by how "smooth and gentle" the coffee felt upon drinking it and that the vanilla added a "light and refreshing touch."

review/summary: Based on this I think I'll stick with Melitta's coffee filters, rather than coffee
review/text: Based on other reviews I see on Amazon, I guess I'm in the minority but I'm a coffee lover - way too many cups a day - and long ago moved from Folgers and Maxwell House. As a base coffee I prefer the smoothness of Colombian coffee and do sometimes drink a flavor. So I thought this coffee would fill the bill. But that was before it arrived.<br /><br />First things first: though Amazon's description says the beans are Arabica, the package itself doesn't. But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. The next thing you notice on the package is that the Vanilla is "naturally and artificially" flavored. What? Vanilla is a natural flavor. Why use ARTIFICAL flavoring?  (At least Amazon says it is artificially flovored in thir listing)<br /><br />Okay, so here is this hard-packed vacuum-sealed bag. You unfold the flap (with that metal band to reseal it, and try to separate the top to get to the coffee. Ever try to open those hard plastic clamshell cases they put electronics in and are frustrating at Christmastime? Well, the paper bag is just like it. It won't separate! So you need to CUT the bag to get inside and then you can't easily reseal it. (Maybe my bag was unusual but you can't return when it's open.<br /><br />Okay now we are the brewing stage. Vanilla is a nice subtle flavor (or should be) but when the hot water hit the grounds in my drip coffee maker the room smelled like I just sprayed it with Vanilla room deodorizer! It was that strong. (Maybe it was the added ARTIFICIAL flavor.). Okay, I then tasted the coffee and, yes, it was smooth but had little COFFEE flavor. It actually tasted no better than those low grade International Coffees that come powdered from Maxwell House.<br /><br />So, though I do use Melitta filters - and have used their bulk whole bean coffee from supermarkets in the past, I can't say this is a product I can recommend. (But then again, I here to drink coffee with a light flavoring, and expect the dominant taste to be that of "coffee".<br /><br />Steve Ramm

review/text: I do not usually purchase flavored coffee, but this Melitta Parisian Vanilla Coffee has been truly delightful!<br />At my church, I prepared the coffee for fellowship, and all of them asked what coffee was this! They were enjoying the aroma of the coffee and the taste of it.<br /><br />1. This is ground coffee, but it is very fine in texture. It could be used with both drip coffee maker and percolator. While both methods produce excellent tasting coffee, I realized that percolator produces far more rich taste of coffee.<br />2. The flavor is rich and tasty. The vanilla flavor is not too strong to dilute a coffee taste, but it is there. The balance is well kept.<br />3. The aroma is sweet but not overpowering. So actually it is very pleasant.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this coffee to anyone. Get your favorite book, relax, and enjoy the coffee!

review/text: I'm usually not too fond of flavored coffees--they usually smell wonderful and taste terrible.  This one is an exception to the rule.  The vanilla flavor scents the entire house, but at the same time, is not unpleasant or overpowering in the coffee itself.  The bold coffee flavor bursts right through, without bitterness, and the vanilla flavoring is just the perfect accent to the coffee flavor.  I drink my coffee with cream and sugar, but I still despise weak flavored coffee.  I want to taste the coffee too!  This one meets the mark on all counts, and while it won't be my "everyday" coffee choice, it is an excellent dessert or special coffee.  It's a buy-again product!

I put up a simple feedback form, where I divided it into five columns to reflect each star. The middle column read "O.K." and to the left and right I put varying degrees of how much they liked this coffee relative to the Green Mountain Coffee we typically drink. On the average the result came O.K., so 3-stars are granted. I added one more star because when I opened the bag its rich aroma welcomed me and gave me a smile.<br /><br />The price per ounce is comparable to the Green Mountain Coffee.

review/text: This. Coffee. Is. AMAZING.  It was so incredibly delicious I do not know what more to say.  We got it the same day we were having about thirty people over for a hymn singing, and every single person who had the coffee asked where we got this, it was that delicious.<br /><br />The only two people who are not that enamored with it are my dad, who has dementia (really), and my husband who likes his coffee black and unflavored.  Even he said that the coffee flavor itself was good enough that he would love to try it out if they have an unflavored, straight up and black coffee.<br /><br />I like my coffee sweet and loaded with cream, but usually I prefer to add the flavor with the creamer, as most flavored coffee beans have a chemically flavor that hits the back of my throat wrong.  This vanilla coffee tasted like the beans grew that way, mellow, naturally vanilla flavored.  It was just good stuff.  I also don't usually like ground coffee at all.  We buy organic beans and grind them ourselves as we need them.  Coffee made from the ready ground stuff tastes weak and insipid to me.  This didn't.  The coffee flavor was rich and full bodied, just also deeply flavored with delicious vanilla.<br /><br />Not overpowering, just incredibly delicious.  In fact, one friend called it dessert.

review/summary: Rich, full flavor.  Amazing aroma!
review/text: Melitta's Parisian Vanilla blend hits all the right notes and makes a wonderfully smooth, luxuriant cup of joe.  The first thing you'll notice is the amazing aroma; a lovely vanilla with hints of cinnamon will meet your snifter, and probably cause some serious salivation.  (My wife said we could brew a pot just for the fragrance.)<br /><br />The coffee flavor is full and rich but not overpowering.  Like other Melitta blends I've sampled, it's very smooth with low acidity, albeit has a darker roast than most, approaching but not quite as "burnt"-tasting as your average French Roast.  This coffee can be sipped, savored, and paired very effectively with pastries or dessert.<br /><br />If you like smooth flavored coffees, this should be a winner for you.  Enjoy!

review/text: The aroma is the greatest aspect of the coffee.  Literally once opened, the entire room smells of the rich vanilla.<br /><br />The taste itself is not too bold, nor too rich with vanilla.  It is a very smooth coffee that works well with breakfast or anytime during the day.  I would compare it to dunkin donuts coffee, however it is less bold.<br /><br />My only complaint was the bag itself.  While I was trying to open it, I basically had to cut the whole thing open.  To be fair, it may be that I just got an abnormally sealed bag.

review/text: This review is for Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee, 11-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3). The packaging of this product was nicely done and not too wasteful, but adequate enough to get the contents delivered without being broken or crushed. The freshness of the coffee was OK, but it was obviously not recently ground due to a lack of intense aroma. I personally am not a big fan of the vanilla flavoring that has been added to the coffee, but it was still OK in terms of flavor. The consistency of the grind was acceptable, and I would classify the strength of the coffee to be medium darkness. Overall, I was somewhat pleased with the quality of this product.

review/summary: Enjoyable vanilla coffee
review/text: I'll start by saying that I prefer flavored coffees.  I drink them black with sugar.<br /><br />Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee has a pleasant smell and a pleasant taste.  The vanilla smell/taste is strong enough to be noticed, but not strong enough to be overwhelming.  The coffee tasted smooth from the first sip to the last. I have been enjoying this coffee to for about a week before writing this review.<br /><br />My favorite flavored coffees are flavored coffees from Green Mountain. I would say that I enjoyed this coffee slightly less than my favorites. But I enjoyed it more than many other coffees, so I plan to buy it again.<br /><br />In this order you will receive three 11-ounce bags of ground coffee.  So the price per bag is very good.  The packaging was excellent.  The trick to easy opening is to pull the package not in the center, but towards one of the ends.  Then 1/4 of the bags opens, providing an opening which is just right for pouring.  When I tried pulling it from the center it did not budge.  I noticed that some previous reviews mentioned a problem opening, and I suspect that this is what they ran into. If you move where you pull on the package just slightly it will open very smoothly.  It was easy to reseal the package for storage.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this flavored coffee to those who like flavored coffees.

I'm an extra-bold k-cup drinker, and prefer dark french roasts.  i rarely drink flavored coffees, even though i like the concept, because they taste a bit watered-down to me generally.

I would definitely drink this on a regular basis- particularly with the k-cup prices going up lately!!!

review/summary: Not really my kind of coffee.
review/text: OK, first lets start with the packaging. Forget about actually being able to pull the two sides apart at the top of the bag to get it open and just get the sissors out of the misc. drawer and cut the top off. Then of course it doesn't seal very well by rolling the bag down and bending the ends of the wire over that's stuck to the bag. There is no way to get anything even close to a seal. So before opening try to find something to put the coffee in after you get the bag open. I used an empty Ovaltine jar, (the Ovaltine would have made better coffee than this does).<br /><br />  When I opened the bag of coffee it had a distinct burnt smell to it with just a faint hint of vanilla hiding in it. It smelled the same as it was brewing in my drip coffee maker. From other flavored coffee's that I've tried I've got used to cutting it 2 scoops of flavored coffee to one of Folgers. This time I used some of the French Roast Folgers. Which was a waist of a scoop of good Folgers coffee. The directions on the bag says to use two level teaspoons of it for every 6 oz. of cold fresh water. I cant even imagine trying to drink a cup as strong as it would be brewed to those directions.<br /><br />  I've tried this coffee with just a little sugar the way that I usually like my coffee and it wasn't drinkable. I tried it with a little chocolate flavored creamer, then a lot of sugar and a lot of chocolate flavored creamer and it still wasn't drinkable. I would really like to have a nice cup of vanilla flavored coffee, but I'm not going to get one from this. No matter what I have tried with it, it still tastes burnt. I even tried it with some French Vanilla flavored creamer and it still tastes burnt.<br /><br />  I would really like to be able to say something positive about this coffee but I cant. I tried to brew a pot in my new;<br />  BUNN HG Phase Brew 8-Cup Home Brewer - even the Bunn coffee maker couldn't get a decent tasting cup of coffee from this, and it makes the best coffee I've ever had.<br />  Maybe this bag came from a bad batch that got burnt by being roasted too long. Maybe what ever puts the vanilla flavoring in it was almost out and it didn't get enough or as much as it was supposed to get. From all the other positive reviews I must have got a bad bag or maybe its because I was a heavy smoker for over 30 yrs before I quit smoking 3 yrs ago and I still have damaged taste buds. Something was causing this to produce undrinkable coffee and if it wasn't the coffee then it has to be something else making it taste bad. Unless you like coffee that tastes burnt don't waist your money on this.

review/summary: Good flavor, smooth taste
review/text: As a fan of flavored coffees, I was excited to see this as an Amazon Vine selection.  I have been trying to diversify my coffee rotation, but so far, I am only a huge fan of Caribou brand Columbia and Dunkin Donuts brand Cinnamon Spice.  After tasting this, I will definitely be looking to try more Melitta brand coffees if I see them in stores, especially since the Caribou brand is becoming harder to find, for some reason.<br /><br />This coffee is very smooth tasting.  I don't understand how some of the reviewers found it burnt and bitter.  In fact, I had assumed from the taste that it was a light roast.  I don't like bitter coffee, which is exactly why I avoid dark roasts.  Additionally, this coffee has a very nice flavor.  Some flavored coffees are so weak that you can't even tell they're flavored.  Not the case here.<br /><br />There were a couple of things I didn't like.  I would have preferred the coffee to be less finely ground, since I use a coffee press.  But I have a strainer I can run it through when I pour it into my cup, so I guess that's a minor inconvenience.  However, companies need to take into consideration that not everyone uses a filtered coffee maker.  Having the option of coarser grinds would be appreciated.  Secondly, the glue used to seal the bag was so strong that I had to cut it open with a pair of scissors, ruining the bag and making it kind of pointless for the bag to have re-sealable tabs.

review/summary: Fragrant, sweet, and strong enough to get you through your day!
review/text: Melitta has hit a home run with their Parisian Vanilla flavored ground coffee. As soon as you open the bag, you're hit with a nice burst of fragrant vanilla scent, paired with the delicious smell that (for me, at least), promises a bright start to your day.<br /><br />The Parisian vanilla flavor is strong enough to be noticeable, but subtle enough to not overpower the coffee flavor that I crave to get me going in the morning. It complements other flavors that are added with it, as well, so if you've got a favorite Hazelnut creamer that you're worried this will clash with, don't. The vanilla flavor in this coffee plays well with others.<br /><br />The coffee itself brews up sweet, strong, and not at all bitter. Melitta has created a collection that just gives you a good cup of joe to start your day with. And with flavor this rich, you just might find yourself leaving that sugar bowl alone. You really don't need it with this flavor in Melitta's Cafe Collection!<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Very powerful vanilla scent and flavor
review/text: This is less traditional coffee and more flavored drink like you'd get from a large coffee shop - filled with milk, etc. - except it's just coffee. The smell is extremely strong and the taste is similar - you get a lot of vanilla with some small coffee hints in the background.<br /><br />If you're interested in strong vanilla, this is it. If you want spectacular coffee, it'll make it - but it won't taste like coffee.

review/summary: Makes a nice gift, but the coffee is so-so.
review/text: Melitta is the sort of coffee you'd often find in a gift basket from a nicer department store or housewares store, and for good reason. The packaging is nice, the aroma is decent, and the coffee is so middle-of-the-road that it's likely to be well-received by just about anyone used to pre-ground national brands.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor tastes artificial, but isn't overpowering. The coffee itself is, again, a true medium roast. Light drinkers will probably go "Ooh! That's a little strong." while dark drinkers will probably say "Well, at least it's not watery."<br /><br />So, as part of a gift, you really can't go wrong (unless the recipient is a strict decaf person), but keeping it around regularly doesn't make much sense to me. Folgers French Vanilla tastes basically the same, and costs way less. Or, you can get better quality coffee by the pound for the same price at most coffee shops or grocery stores.

review/summary: Oh So Smooth
review/text: I instantly fell in love with the Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee as soon as I opened the bag and got my first whiff of the aroma. It smelled every bit as good while being brewed, and finally when I tried my first cup, I was met with a flavor that was exceptionally pleasing. This coffee has a nice vanilla accent to it that is neither too overpowering, nor is it fleeting. Very well rounded is how I would describe the flavor. It goes down very smooth, with no bitterness, and no odd aftertastes. I can see this coffee being a regular choice around my house. Add a bit of sweetener to it and really comes alive like a liquid treat in a cup.

review/summary: Melitta coffees are usually great-- but this one has an overwhelming artificial taste
review/text: Bleh!  I am a flavored coffee person, but I really disliked this artificially ("and naturally") flavored Parisian Vanilla coffee from Melitta-- it has an overpowering, heavy chemical flavor and aroma.<br /><br />The artificial flavoring of this coffee is just plain yucky, almost sickening-- I can just picture the "food chemists" at work coming up with this!  Truly, it does not taste like vanilla.  (Such an odd thing these days, that artificial fragrances and flavors are given names we associate with positive things--like vanilla--when they are nothing like the real thing!)<br /><br />I recently tried diluting this --1 scoop vanilla + two scoops of an unflavored Melitta coffee-- and it was STILL icky and overwhelming.  The packaging was surprisingly difficult to open and then reseal, too.  Not recommended!

review/summary: Too sweet for me...if you love vanilla you will like this
review/text: I prefer the robust blends of coffee. No cream, no sugar, just black bold coffee. Having tried Melitta Hazelnut Creme Brulee coffee, and liking it, decided to give this a try.<br />The coffee comes packaged in a foil vacuum sealed bag. It is appreciated that vacuum sealing a foil bag maintains freshness, the bag is then shredded in an attempt to get to its contents.  Could use a packaging overhaul.  Smells delicious, but very sweet when you can finally get it open. The grind is perfect for my French press, and would also work well with a coffeemaker. I use the "usual" amount of coffee for brewing and the result is a smooth, if rather sweet, cup of  coffee.<br />Flavor: The coffee itself is smooth and flavorful.  The vanilla flavoring adds sweetness, which I don't particularly care for.  Perhaps if it was more subtle.<br />Acidity: A very smooth cup of coffee, which no bitterness, and no heartburn.<br />Use: This is a too much for me for my morning cup of coffee. The coffee, while flavorful with moderately intense taste, has too much vanilla for this to be a regular daily grind.  One scoop of this to about 3 scoops of something else would be just right for me.<br />For those of you who like a lighter, flavored coffee, you will probably love this. You may be able to skip your coffee additives and drink it black. It would make a nice after dinner coffee with dessert, keeping in mind the vanilla flavor (don't choose a dessert that will fight with your coffee).

review/summary: Excellent tasting coffee
review/text: The brand name didn't really attract me to this product.  With coffee I seldom go for big brands and love to try unique coffees from small independent roasters.  I have to honestly say, though, that this was one of the smoothest, most enjoyable coffees I have tasted in a long time.  This product proves the idea of trying something you wouldn't ordinarily try (like stopping by a local restuarant you've never tried just on a whim).  Sometimes you lose and sometimes you discover a jewel.  In this case I have discovered a tast coffee that I will definitely buy a quantity of from Amazon just to have it as my "everyday" coffee inbetween the more exotic flavors I experiment with.

review/summary: A nice desert coffee
review/text: The better the coffee, the higher the price. So, even tho they say this coffee is grown in high areas of the world, dont bet it contains coffee beans from the hawaian volcanos, Jamaican mountains, or the Ethiopian highlands, even tho the coffee bag says the "High Grown Beans" are harvested from the "Finest coffee producing regions around the world" . Its 100% arabian coffee, like a lot of the coffee at the grocery store. It's got a great vanilla scent and aftertaste, but then again, its naturally and artificially flavored. So if you are a conneseseur of the finest coffees, and finest flavorings, you'll probibly pick up on this divergence between what the bag claims, and what the Amazon discription claims. However, if your palette is not so discerning, you'll not spot the difference. From my standpoint, MELITTA's PARISIAN VANILLA produced a good, solid cup of "desert coffee". It's smooth enough, but you'll probibly want to add sweetener and some cream or milk, to bring out the vanilla flavoring.  It did drink well, to the bottom of the cup, without becoming bitter. (Milk tends to keep Cafe au Lait from becoming too bitter, tho.) It smells wonderful, by the way.

review/summary: A smooth and flavorful French Vanilla roast
review/text: I'm not a fan of flavored coffees, but I enjoyed this one. Coming out of the bag, the smell is chocolaty and the vanilla aroma is very strong and pleasant. It produces a coffee that is smooth and creamy, with a thin layer of fine froth at the top when I made it in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00264FT9K">Bodum French Press</a>. I like my coffee piping hot with Half & Half and 3 sugars. The sweetness really brings out the vanilla flavor. Drinking it black, however, there's not much flavor to write home about. Without sugar and cream, it doesn't taste like either coffee or vanilla.<br /><br />The grind is extra fine. I was pleased by the small amount of the dust that passed through the Bodum and into my cup. For French Vanilla lovers, this is a very good price for 3 bags of coffee. The only gotcha is that it is "Naturally and Artificially Flavored" and not all natural. It tastes good, however. Lastly, the product is kosher, as indicated by the U symbol on the bag.

review/summary: Melitta provides rich flavor at a great value
review/text: Half the price of Starbucks, Melitta offers great value for coffee drinkers wanting a rich coffee with creamy vanilla and a sweet finish.<br /><br />To compare value, we tried Melitta and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ54H8">Starbucks House Blend Coffee, Ground</a> which is available on Amazon for $29.59 (three, 12-ounce bags). Starbucks works out to 82 cents per ounce while Melitta is 55 cents per ounce (for three, 11-ounce bags).<br /><br />You can reduce the Melitta price further--to 46 cents per ounce--if you take advantage of Amazon's Subscribe & Save program. Hands down: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TN49F8">Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee</a> is the better value.<br /><br />This coffee comes in an extra fine grind that paired well with our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YY9X">Bodum Columbia 8-Cup Stainless-Steel Thermal Press Pot</a>. We detected no bitterness. We brewed two pots, one for home and the other I take to the office in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009V4FM">Thermos Nissan Stainless-Steel Vacuum Insulated Briefcase Bottle</a>.<br /><br />I spike my Melitta coffee with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00284TTG2">SToK Caffeinated Black Coffee Shots</a> in the afternoon to combat the after-lunch fade. Melitta's Parisian Vanilla is especially tasty as a substitute for or a complement to dessert after lunch or dinner.<br /><br />Rating: four stars. Buonissimo!

review/text: This coffee tastes as good as, or even better than anything Starbucks or any of the "gourmet" coffees I've tried, and costs about the same. Just smelling it in the morning will wake you up, and I love the light vanilla with a little milk and sweetener added. Even when I tried it black, there was no bitterness. If you avoid coffee because it's too acidic for your stomach, you should try this brand. I didn't taste any acidity and had no upset stomach afterward like you can get with some coffees-- especially if you drink it straight. I really like it and will definitely order more when I run out.

review/summary: Good but not great...
review/text: Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee is good, but not great.  The coffee has a lovely vanilla scent when brewing, but the taste has a bit of an "artificial" flavor to it.  I regularly drink my coffee sweetened, with lots of added cream and a little vanilla.  With the Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee, I skipped adding the vanilla, of course.  It didn't taste quite as rich as the coffee made with pure vanilla extract, but it was a close second.<br /><br />Overall, Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee is a good dessert coffee that I'd recommend if you don't feel like mixing your own vanilla coffee.

review/summary: Good But Nothing Special
review/text: I love coffee.  While there is nothing wrong with most stuff that comes from a can, a great cup of flavored coffee or a nice blend of beans is the way to go in my opinion.  I've never been a big fan of the over roasted beans from Charbucks.  Seeing this was a vanilla flavored coffee with a blend of beans from the Americas, I was anticipating a decent cup of coffee.<br /><br />My initial impression was one of frustration.  I am used to being able to open a bag of coffee like I would a bag of potato chips.  I worked on this bag for about 5 minutes and was not able to open it with my bare hands.  I'm sure one could argue it seals in freshness, but personally I thought it was annoying.  So out came the scissors.<br /><br />With the bag open, I wasn't particularly impressed with the bouquet.  There was a definite vanilla scent but not an overwhelming scent that I find in many bulk flavored bean varieties from the grocery stores.  What I did notice right off is that there was not a strong coffee smell.<br /><br />So the million dollar question is how does it taste?  Personally, I thought the first few sips were bitter.  However, the coffee is a mild flavor much like I would expect with a coffee made with beans from the Americas.  I did not detect any significant burnt flavor like you get with a typical dark roast.  I did not think the coffee was at all acidy.<br /><br />I personally did not find the vanilla flavoring overpowering (and I usually mix my flavored coffee half and half with a regular roast when I brew it).  As a matter of fact, I found the vanilla flavoring to be a bit odd.  To me, it did not really have a good vanilla flavor.  I thought it had a bit of a sweet characteristic with the flavoring, but there was no creaminess to it that I would have expected.  To be honest, it reminds me of adding the Splenda French Vanilla Flavor Blend to a cup of regular coffee.<br /><br />Overall, it was not a bad cup of coffee.  I think if the coffee had better flavoring it would be a very good cup of coffee.  I think this coffee is worth a try, but personally I will not be switching from my personal favorites for this brand.<br /><br />The one positive that comes to mind with this blend is with its low acidity, mild roast, and sweet moderate flavoring, it would be a good blend to serve a broad spectrum of people.  It probably would be a great choice for an office coffee maker or to serve at a party.

review/text: Upon opening the package I found the aroma quite strong so what we did was put one scoop of this to three scoops of regular coffee and it was absolutely wonderful.  I have also tried it straight as a latte and it was really really good.  Oh Yumm!  Latte's are my weekness and this coffee is going to be a favorite in that department.<br /><br />I don't know about the rest of you but I tend to mix and match my coffee's when brewing and I think that is the best way to have flavored coffee.  That is unless you like a strong flavor.  I also mixed this with some pumpkin spice coffee of another brand which I will not mention and oh my....love at first sight.<br /><br />I have tried this iced and hot and tend to like it iced better but it's summer so what can I say.  Will see come winter when I tend to drink it hot on how much more of less I like it.  If you really like flavored coffee then this is a great coffee for you.

Most of the time flavored coffee's come off overwhelming or under flavored to me and very hard to get "just right" and that's got a person to person preference to it.  In this case my wife thought it was a bit strong and I thought it was a bit weak.  We both agreed it's a good cup of coffee.  Overall no complaints, but no agreement in the household on it as a vanilla flavored coffee.

On the plus side, there was no funny aftertaste like many vanilla flavored coffees have. Simply put, if you like a strong vanilla flavor, this is a good choice for you. If you prefer the actual coffee to be the focus, and the vanilla to be more of a background note, this is not the choice for you.

review/summary: This is Good Stuff!
review/text: I really enjoy a nice cup of coffee with a hint of vanilla in the morning.  I usually mix my own concoction of a nice Colombian breakfast blend (3 parts) and a vanilla bean (1 part).  I figured I'd try the Melitta by itself before mixing my own brew.  I was PLEASANTLY surprised!  This is really good coffee.  I wish I had received the whole bean version instead of ground, but the flavor was delicious, with a low to medium hint of vanilla.  The vanilla flavoring didn't intrude on the coffee's overall taste at all.  I found myself pouring a second cup right away.<br /><br />The coffee was so good, that the next day I didn't bother to mix my concoction either.  I just enjoyed the Melitta Cafe by itself.  Highly recommended if you like your brew mild with a hint of vanilla.

review/text: I love this brand of coffee.  They make a "Classique Supreme Ground Coffee" which I really like.  So I was glad to try out their vanilla-flavored coffee.<br />-<br />It's ok.  I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffees anymore - although at one point it was all I drank.<br />-<br />I should also start by saying that I use the Keurig coffee maker - you know that one-cup at a time thing?  The machine that's better than the Tassimo?  Well, the Keurig coffee maker I have also allows you to brew regular coffee by way of an adapter, rather than always having to buy those k-cup things.<br />-<br />So I tried this vanilla coffee.  It's ok.  I would say it was slightly weaker than the "Classic Supreme", and it may be due to the size of the grounds -  perhaps these grounds are larger than the "Classic Supreme".  I didn't think it had a very strong vanilla flavor, but it was nice.  I did like it - I just wasn't blown away.  I like it less than the Classic Supreme, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it!  I will still use it - this brand of coffee turns out really well when you use the Keurig coffee maker.<br />A mild brew.

review/summary: A great coffee for any time of the day...
review/text: If Melitta doesn't sell good coffee, who does?  I grew up using Melitta filters and still individually make each cup of coffee in a single cup filter. Generally I use pre ground coffee (so I am not a purist), although I occasionally grind my own.  I usually drink two cups of coffee a day.  Enough about my coffee habits.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Parisian Vanilla  (extra fine grind) coffee from Melitta and it lived up to its advertising, "Rich and creamy vanilla with smooth, delicately sweet finish."  Mostly, I drink plain caffeinated coffee, however I enjoyed having a special coffee treat. Vanilla is definitely a great coffee flavor enhancer.  Although quite a brisk brew, the vanilla mellows the blend enough to satisfy my taste buds. I suggest controlling the heartiness by using slightly less than the recommended amount.<br /><br />If you are a fan of flavored coffees and feel like skipping Starbucks for a day, this coffee is for you.

It's not quite as strong in the coffee, but it's still present, and it complements vanilla creamers especially well. The coffee itself is smooth and entirely without bitterness -- it makes a smooth cup that is just wonderful.<br /><br />In terms of grind it's not too coarse, which is great because it seemed to last a lot longer. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />I received this coffee through the Vine program, but I plan on buying it in a few more flavors. My usual poison is Eight O'Clock and I loved this, so I'll recommend it especially to anyone who likes the Eight O'Clock Coffee varieties.

review/summary: Nice Flavored Coffee
review/text: Melitta Calfe's Vanilla ground coffee is an excellent flavored coffee.  I generally don not drink flavored coffees, but I found this one to a good taste, very smooth and not too bitter.  I have tried non flavored Melitta in the past and find that its generally smooth taste to be very complimentary to a flavored coffee.  I used the coffee in several ways.  I brewed a pot of just the flavored coffee and found the vanilla taste a little too much for me.  I later mixed the flavored coffee with a regular medium roast coffee and found it to be very nice with a good balance of flavor (I used two parts flavored coffee to one part regular).  You also don't need very much sugar with this flavored coffee. A good product that I would use again.

review/summary: Flavoring tastes odd
review/text: Let me start with that I'm a heavy coffee drinker, primarily flavored coffees.  Vanilla is one of my favorites, normally.  This coffee is a real disappointment.  The main reason that I don't like this coffee is that the vanilla flavoring tastes odd to me, definitely artificial or even slightly metallic.  In addition, there is an aftertaste.  Price wise, at the current $8.72 per pound, this is no bargain either.

review/summary: Too strong, burned flavor
review/text: This is an extra fine grind, so you don't need to use very much.  The "roast" of the coffee seems overdone, and the vanilla flavor is overpowering, such that this tastes more like burned vanilla than like coffee.  I suspect that people who like really strong, very dark roasted coffee will like it, but I do not.

review/summary: Fine Gourmet Coffee in an Impossible Package
review/text: I'm a grind-my-own kind of guy, and I'm not much for flavored coffees, but I have to admit that this is very nice, and if you have it with the right food (like a nice piece of pie), the vanilla adds a little something extra to the experience.<br /><br />But the bag it came in...GRR!<br /><br />It's apparent that Melitta is trying to ensure freshness with the double-seal they used, but after trying for about 5 minutes and managing only to tear the foil above the seal, I gave up and cut the bag with scissors.<br /><br />In other words, you'll need a canister if you want it to keep this coffee fresh, because, unless you have more luck than I did opening the package, storing it in the bag is not an option.

review/summary: Hubby really likes it!
review/text: I'm not big on coffee but I thought the Vanilla would make it more mild.  It definitely made it milder and I made a milkshake with it and YUM!  Hubby, on the other hand is a serious coffee drinker.  He drinks it black and he likes it strong.  He takes a thermos of coffee to work with him every day.  He tried this and says in his opinion it makes a great weekend coffee.  It's got a sweetness to it that he doesn't want to drink while he's at work but he really likes it for days when he's not going for strong, black, keep him awake coffee.<br /><br />The sweetness of it isn't overwhelming and makes for a good dessert coffee or would be good with breakfast on a cold winter morning!

review/summary: goodbye creamer, Hello Built in Flavor
review/text: I'm very skeptical when it comes to buying flavored coffee. Most Flavored coffees that come in flavors I like are just terrible, so I just usually add flavored creamer to solve the problem. And I like my coffee flavored. So when the offer to sample this came along, I said "what the heck? I'm not paying for it". I didn't except much based on my previous disappoinments with other flavored coffees. I was so wrong<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TN49F8">Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee</a> is jammed packed with a delicious vanilla flavor that's so good, it doesn't need anything  added to it, except maybe a little sweetener<br /><br />The Vanilla flavor doesn't over power the coffee flavor. It's blended perfectly. There's not much more I can say except this is really good vanill coffee.<br /><br />There is however one issue other than the bag being difficult to open - It tastes really terrible cold.<br />I do enjoy iced coffee every now and then. When I gave this a try cold, it tasted different, in a bad way<br /><br />Other than that, this is excellent coffee

review/summary: Incredibly smooth, soothing coffee
review/text: I loved it even as I opened the package to be greeted by my first whiff of amazing vanilla. Finely ground, it is roasted to avoid all bitterness and succeeds! Smooth drinking and aromatic after brewing in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037ZG3DS">Mr. Coffee BVMC-PSTX91 Optimal Brew 10-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker</a>. Clear instructions should be followed - 2 tsp per 6 oz of water for best results. Small, vacuum sealed, bags mean your coffee won't go stale before you can enjoy it all - and the old-style bend tab closure works well to seal on the fly. I'm definitely hooked and want to try other Melitta coffees now.

review/summary: Smooth, Rich, Creamy.  YUM!
review/text: I love this Melitta coffee.  I'm a big fan of Melitta coffees in general, but this one is fantastic.  First of all it smells fantastic as it's brewing. It fills the entire house with a beautiful vanilla aroma.  I normally put some creamer in my coffee, but for my review I drank a cup black.  The coffee is very smooth and has no bite to it at all.  Even without cream, it has a very creamy texture to it.  It's bold without being overpowering.  I highly recommend the Melitta Parisian Vanilla coffee.<br /><br />Separately, my husband drinks coffee every day but does not appreciate coffee the same way I do.  If you're this type of coffee drinker I recommend saving your money.  While my husband loved the aroma of the coffee, he didn't even notice the difference in flavor between his usual generic brand of coffee.<br /><br />Great for coffee lovers, ho-hum for an average coffee drinker.

review/summary: Delicious gourmet coffee.
review/text: I have always wanted to try Melitta Coffee, so I jumped at the chance to sample this product. I have to say, it is one of the best coffee blends out there. I love the aroma...it has a strong vanilla odor but it is not overwhelming. The way the coffee smells out of the package is exactly what it tastes like. This is a very bold brew with a satisfying vanilla flavor. It is a darker and full-bodied brew, and I loved how smooth it tasted. I highly recommend this flavor to anyone thinking of trying it.

review/summary: Pretty decent flavored blend
review/text: PROS:<br /><br />The vanilla flavor did not overpower the coffee taste at all, it was actually quite balanced. A lot of flavored coffees go overboard with the concept and thus have a tendency to taste artificial, but this particular blend kept it's perspective.<br /><br />The coffee had a rich, dark grind but brewed up like a good breakfast blend. It had a nice aroma right out of the bag and made for an inviting smell in the kitchen as it brewed.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />The bag was impossible to open without cutting. The restrainer tie broke off after about 6 uses and I had to use a bag clip to keep the bag closed. In other words, they used GREAT glue to seal in the freshness, and then used an adhesive that was about as effective as old bubble gum to help KEEP the coffee fresh once the bag was open. Can't quite figure out the engineering on that one.<br /><br />PRO AND A CON DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT:<br /><br />This coffee, like ALL Melitta coffees has a VERY fine grind. It's made for drip coffee makers that use a filter, which is no surprise since Melitta takes credit for inventing the modern paper cone filtration system used in basket filter coffee makers. An extra fine grind means that you can get away with using a bit less coffee, but it also means that you can't use something like a Bodum press to brew this coffee.<br /><br />OVERALL IMPRESSION:<br /><br />A solid 4-star coffee. The frustration with the packaging kind of got to me, but once you get past that, it's pretty good stuff, and well worth it if you like flavored coffees.

review/summary: Full bodied coffee with soft vanilla flavor
review/text: I enjoyed this coffee very much, but I think it's important to be clear about the details of the taste, and how to brew it for maximum enjoyment.First, this coffee has a full bodied flavor similar to French Roast. The taste of the coffee itself is deep & rich. As such, the vanilla flavor is subtle. It's not as "prominent" as flavored coffee you buy in the supermarket (that coffee tastes "heavy & fake" in the flavoring department). If that's how you like your coffee(with heavy flavoring and less "coffee") you will NOT enjoy this coffee. This isn't the cheap Vietnamese coffee that everyone's been drinking since most companies have stopped using Columbian coffee. Vietnamese has a very lightweight flavor (no "body") and takes on a much stronger taste with artificial flavoring.<br /><br />This coffee doesn't taste quite as good when percolated through an electric machine. It's still great...but the flavor gets diminished this way. Try a French Press or better yet, a "pour through" gadget (see the manual coffee maker below) made by Melitta... instead. This way of making it makes a coffee that...well....blew my socks off.<br /><br />For coffee addicts & lovers...you'll understand this coffee. For those who think Yuban is great, probably NOT. Personally, I loved it and will be back for more. I would have given it 5 stars if the taste was the same with electric brewing as it was with more "rustic" methods using boiling water. As it is..making it by the cup made alot of difference and that's why my review gives it 4 stars instead of 5. Most people will use an electric coffee maker, and depending upon the brand (Krups would probably be ok) it may be less than superb.<br /><br />This is the ideal pot to use for this coffee:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Melitta-Manual-Coffeemaker-10-Cup/dp/B000MIT2OK/ref=pd_sim_k_3<br /><br />I use the one cup size for myself, and that's handy for me.<br /><br />*This coffee is ground very fine and is ideal to use with a manual coffee maker.*

review/summary: A Smooth And Full Body Taste
review/text: I'm kind of a coffee snob,I am very selective and and I won't drink crappy coffee. I gave up on the stuff at the local supermarket decades ago and since the 80's I've consumed mainly Gevalia coffee because I like my coffee STRONG but never bitter,always smooth with great taste.<br /><br />In the past year after reading the coffee reviews here at Amazon,I added Douwe Egberts to my daily coffee rotation and now the tasty Melitta Cafe Collection coffee has now joined my personal lifestyle.<br /><br />I like my coffee two ways,hot during most months and over ice with milk during these HOT summer months and I've tried this Melitta both ways and it's a real tasty winner.<br /><br />I'm very selective about flavored coffees because of a bad Gevalia experience a couple years but Vanilla seemed a safe bet so I checked it out and it's a real winner. It's a very subtle,not an overpowering flavor and I find it to be a true delight each day.<br /><br />I look forward to trying some of the other Melitta coffees after this great discovery!

I thoroughly enjoyed this blend and intend to buy some without hesitation.  If you like vanilla, you will be crazy over this coffee.  It is great in the morning, or as a after dinner treat. What a nice treat! In fact, I have to go make a pot now! Talking about it is making me want it.  It is especially good with a little fresh whipping cream. Buonissimo!

review/text: Normally I like my coffee to taste like coffee. I've never been a fan of flavored coffee. Surprisingly, I liked Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla. The vanilla flavor is not overpowering, or overly sweet. I did notice a long vanilla aftertaste. Some people may enjoy this. Some may not. I actually enjoyed the smell of it brewing more than the taste. I did enjoy drinking it though. It's not a coffee I'd want to drink everyday instead of regular coffee, but for a change every now and then, I like it. Fans of flavored coffee will probably enjoy it more than I did. If you're used to drinking your coffee 'black, no sugar', this may not be the coffee for you though.

review/summary: Better than your average vanilla coffee
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of this vanilla coffee. Honestly, I avoid vanilla coffee like the plague because I usually find it bitter and acidic. However this coffee was bold, but smooth. The vanilla taste was stronger than I prefer, so the next time I make it, I think I will use 1/2 vanilla coffee and 1/2 unflavored coffee. While I like this, I still prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV38A">Melitta Cafe Collection Vienna Roast Ground Coffee, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>. The Vienna Roast has a more pleasant taste and I plan to order more.<br /><br />Two slight inconveniences are the following: opening this package is like trying to break into Ft. Knox. However this is probably because it is vacuum-sealed. So plan to use scissors when opening it. Also, note that this coffee is very finely ground, so it won't work with a French press, unless you plan to chew some of your coffee. However, particularly with the Vienna Roast, I felt like I got French roast taste with my bottom-of-the-line drip coffee pot.<br /><br />One thing I discovered about this coffee is that brewed double strengh and blended with milk, sweetner and ice, it makes AMAZING frappucino. This is the reason I gave it 5 stars. It is officially my favorite frappucino coffee!

review/summary: A high quality blend of smoothness and richness.
review/text: I've got to admit that I prefer non-flavored coffees. So for the purposes of this review, I elicited the opinions of my wife who prefers flavored coffees. So what follows are her comments...<br /><br />I thought the Melitta Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee came in a really nice, high quality bag. I enjoyed the subtle swirl pattern on the bag and it just elicited an overall impression of European quality and luxuriousness. The little tabs that enable you to close the bag are a bit longer, and heavier duty than those found on other coffee bags that I've used. Keeping air out of the bag is important and this bag helps you to do that. The coffee would make a nice gift to another coffee lover because of the appearance and quality of the bag itself.<br /><br />And I haven't even gotten to the coffee yet... I thought the flavor of the Parisian Vanilla coffee was quite smooth, rich but with a small amount of a bitter aftertaste. Not so much to make it objectionable but enough to prevent me from giving it a full 5-star rating.  I make my coffee in a Keurig machine (with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and am very happy with the results. It works really well in my Keurig. Sometimes with other coffees, the grind isn't quite right, either too fine or too coarse and the Keurig can be picky about that... too fine a grind and the filter will plug up and the Keurig will labor while trying to push the water through the grounds. Too coarse and you don't get enough coffee flavor and the coffee is "thin." No problem with the grind of the Melitta coffee. Even though it is labeled as "extra-fine" it works perfectly in the Keurig.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoy this coffee. The balance in flavor between the coffee and vanilla is just right. The grind is perfect for use in my Keurig and the packaging is of high quality.<br /><br />Thanks wife... husband now takes over... although I prefer non-flavored coffee, I did enjoy this coffee as well. It wasn't overly "vanilla-y" and had good overall taste in mouth. I agree with the bag comments that my wife made and I also give this a 4-star rating which makes things a lot easier.

review/text: This coffee was very popular at my work.  Since I only drink a moderate amount of coffee myself, I brought it to the office and my co-workers loved it.  I also had mine over ice and liked it this way as well.  I don't enjoy very strong coffee and even avoid some coffee places as they tend to taste strong and bitter; this had a very good taste the way I drink it - black with a 2 Truvia sweetener packs. I also like McDonald's coffee so don't hold that against me. :)
