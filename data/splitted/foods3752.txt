Yes, you can buy a bag of almonds, count out 22 almonds & place them in a zip lock snack bag which is more economical. If you want fast, easy, & fresh, with no fear of the snack bag opening up in the bottom of your purse, these grab & go bags are worth the price.  Just note that these are not salted.  They are natural almonds, very fresh, but plain.  They are worth a try.

review/summary: Hot and Good
review/text: Everyone wants to know how hot these types of sauces are. On a heat scale, I would rate it 6/10. The best thing about the sauce is its taste, which is pleasant. The heat hits you all up front and doesn't get worse and worse like other ghost pepper sauces. It didn't hit the throat too much, just mostly on the tongue. I would recommend this sauce. Its also a good sauce to start with for a beginner who wants to take the first plunge. A drop goes a long way.

review/summary: great flavor and plenty of heat
review/text: This is one of my favorite hot sauces for general use on sandwiches, burgers, chicken, burritos, etc.  It is a mustard-based sauce with a nicely balanced flavor in which its other ingredients (red wine vinegar, onions, garlic, habaneros, ghost peppers, and spices) come through nicely.  I love the heat-to-flavor ratio, but your mileage may vary depending on how much tolerance you have for capsaicin.  Based on subjective comparisons, I estimate its heat to be lower than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DIX2M">Blair's After Death</a>, higher than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DIWWD">Blair's Original Death</a>, similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LBNUUU">Pain 100%</a>, and much lower than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DID5R">Dave's Insanity</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00170OV48">Mad Dog 357</a>.<br /><br />Compared to other mustard-based sauces I regularly eat:<br /> * It is hotter than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036LBP8Q">Mad Dog 357 Extreme Mustard</a> and has less mustard flavor and more other flavors<br /> * It is much hotter than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DG4MK">Colon Cleaner</a><br /> * It is not as hot as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030IX1IW">Bubba's Butt Blaster</a><br /><br />Each sauce has unique flavors, and each goes well with certain foods.  Hellhound has a very nice flavor and enough heat to really spice up a dish without dominating its flavor too much.  Unlike the ultra-hot extract-based sauces, you can use enough to add a decent amount of flavor without making a dish too hot (depending on your capsaicin tolerance, of course ... some of my friends think Hellhound is ridiculously hot).

review/summary: Ginger & Mustard??
review/text: These were very disappointing.  I ate a small handful and physically went, "blehhh".  I'll eat them because they weren't cheap and I really like nuts but I definately wouldn't buy them again.<br />The name "Steakhouse Seasoning" is, imo, misleading in that the ingredients list (which wasn't available when I purchased them through my daughter's school *fundraiser* program or I wouldn't have bought them) includes ginger & Mustard (seriously?).  Now, I don't know what steakhouse Paula Deen goes to where they use ginger or mustard to season their steaks, but I wouldn't want either one on mine, I can tell you that; and it doesn't work on a nut, either.<br />It is an odd combination of spices altogether, really...and they just don't work.<br />Check it out:<br />INGREDIENTS:  Paprika, Onion Powder, Mustard (?! on steak??), Ground Ginger (??), Black Pepper, Ground Cumin (WHY?), Whole Thyme, Ground Red Chili, White Pepper.<br />Save your $$ and choose something else.<br /><br />PS:  Her "House Seasoning" peanuts are better but kinda salty, which I don't mind.  Those have S&P, Onion and Garlic Powders...but I wouldn't buy those again, either.<br />Hope this helps!

I make clam chowder once or twice a month {cold weather} for family or friends.<br /><br />We had company coming that night. Thank goodness I tried it before they arrived. I ended up throwing it out!!<br />I e-mailed Amazon and told them the problem and wanted a credit to my account..Less than 30 minutes I received a e-mail from Amazon.<br /><br />Was informed that a credit would be giving. Will show on my account in two or three days, which it did. Told not to send the two cases back. Get rid of it anyway I wanted.. Our cats would not eat it, not the dog!!  I took it to the dump!!<br /><br />I could not believe the speed in how Amazon handled this problem!! I have NEVER dealt with a company that moved this fast!!!! I made a mistake ordering a dvd. E-mailed Amazon and it was taken care of with in a half-hour!!!<br /><br />I have NEVER received a dented can , nor crush package..

review/summary: 1 or 2 clams in each can will have sand or shell fragments.  Product of Mainland China.
review/text: ADVANTAGES:  (1)These clams taste quite good.  (2)The can is easy to open with a can opener.  (3)Just as oysters are an extremely, extremely rich source of zinc, clams are an extremely, extremely rich source of iron.  (4)Clams are low in mercury and other marine pollutants.  (5)Clams contain a small amount of the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, which have been shown to prevent many human diseases.  (6)At less than $2.00 per can, the price is right.  (7)The quantity of clams in each can is adequately good.  DISADVANTAGES:  (1)Approximately 1 to 2 clams in each can will have sand in them or be attached to shell fragments.

review/summary: BEST Dog Food!!!
review/text: My puppy who is a toy rat terrier was not eating very much of her merrick puppy plate and not gaining any weight. So the vet told me to mix wet food with her dry food. So I switched her to Fromm's Surf & Turf grain free dry and then started mixing some of the Fromm's wet canned shredded beef. My puppy devoured this and licked her bowl and went looking for more. The best part is that I can take her right outside after eating and she goes right away. And, her stools were still formed not messy. (Gross, I know but important to pet owners who don't want to clean up mess). This stuff is better than Weruva too. The weruva cans were filled with more liquid and consequently, the stools reflected this. But Fromm's is the best. THe doggie loves it and she didn't have any side effects even transitioning her all at once the way I did. The ingredients in the food are all totally healthy and the pup loves it. Great company, all holistic, safe, and made in the USA not  in Communist health hazard China.

review/text: I have an 8lb chihuahua/terrier mix who would not consistently eat his meals.  I'd feed him twice a day and there would be days he'd literally only eat a 1/4c food if that.  I figured to try mixing wet canned food w his dry.  I have been feeding him Fromm dry, he only eats the gold label for some reason, but hey if it ain't broken don't fix it!!<br /><br />I bought a can of the 4 star canned food and the other type of canned food they sell (can't think of the name, but it's more of a pur&eacute;e mush).  He didn't care Much for those cans but gobbled the four star shredded beef up!  I returned the other type and got beef, pork, and chicken.  Right now he's tried beef and chicken and loves them both.  I think it's the fact that their is more chunks that he likes.  Il do a serving of his dry food with a spoon full to two and mix.  He gobbles it up with no issue.  He even spends his time licking the bowl haha.  I can attest to the other post, that after eating his serving this morning waiting 10 min going out, dog did his business no problem (AND he pooped before he ate) so I know it was the food haha!<br /><br />All in all of you dog is having trouble eating dry food through a little of this in and they CANNOT say no!!!!

review/text: I've been using Louisiana's Chipotle Pepper Hot Sauce for several years and I think it is probably in my top three hot sauces of all time in terms of flavor and heat.<br /><br />And the odd thing about this sauce is that you actually taste the smoke flavor BEFORE the heat. Most of the time the heat and smoke come together, or even the heat before the smoke. Also it isn't super vinegary like Tabasco sauce is.<br /><br />I've put this stuff on nachos, tacos, enchiladas, sandwiches, in cheese sauces, soups, drinks, stews, you name it, I've probably used this stuff.<br /><br />The only thing I might be able to complain about the stuff is that it is a bit runny.<br /><br />If you want heat, spice, and smoke all in one package, get this stuff!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Pretty cheap.<br />Very chipotley taste.<br />Good on everything.<br /><br />Cons:<br />A bit runny.

I've looked all over the net, and Amazon.com is the best price on the 24-count when comparing the price and the shipping.  My husband thinks the orange is tasty.  The mango tea is a taste to be desired; if you like mango, you would like it.  The raspberry tea is palatable.  Have a great one!

review/text: So far I've lost 7 pounds after drinking two flats of Celsius, but I can't say how much is from the Celsius and how much is from my new diet.  What I am sure of is that Celsius is helping me stick to my new reduced calorie diet: something in it seems to have an appetite suppressant quality.  Whenever I feel like snacking, I have a Celsius with an apple and some almonds, maybe a piece of low-fat cheese.  It might be something that I could get from *any* energy drink (e.g. caffeine) but I'm not sure.  It also helps give me energy to make up for the sluggishness from my reduced calorie diet, but again, there's nothing unique to Celsius there.<br /><br />Even though I've lost weight, I am *not* convinced that Celsius is really all that effective at weight loss.  First, it appears to be mostly caffeine, so what's really special about this versus all the other drinks out there?  Second,am I supposed to burn 100 calories from shaking from the stimulant?  Over time, I expect a stimulant effect to go away as I get used to the caffeine.  This whole 100 calories per bottle, it says "up to 100 calories or more," so it could be 100 calories, 1000 calories, or even zero.  And is that 100 calories over my basic metabolic rate, or is it just 100 calories?  I burn more than 100 calories an hour just sleeping, so I hope that's not what they're referring to!<br /><br />All that said, I just ordered my third case, on the theory that why should I possibly spoil a good thing that I've got going?  Maybe when I've lost more weight, I'll try just the diet with no celsius.<br /><br />But I'm not ordering the Cola flavor again just yet.  The taste is not horrid - a light fizz, which adds to the filling effect, and a reasonably accurate "cola" taste - but there is a bit of an aftertaste I'm not fond of.  It's miles better than the green tea raspberry acai though!  I tried a sample of the orange soda, and liked it a lot, so I'm trying that next.

review/summary: This Will Wake You Up! Highly Recommended!
review/text: Celsius Calorie Burner Cola is every bit (or more so) as energizing as any of the other energy drinks (Monster, AMP, etc), but it has the added benefit of also tasting great! This "Cola" flavor has a crisp ginger taste that I really like and makes it very refreshing, especially when served very cold.<br /><br />While I can't really confirm that this actually burns 100 Calories just by drinking a whole can, it certainly would not surprise me since this does pack a serious kick. I now drink a can of this about a half hour before my workouts and it does seem to give me more energy throughout the whole hour and half or so. On occasions where I don't have time to grab a cup of my morning coffee, one of these does the job of waking me up just fine.<br /><br />A note of caution: I do have a high caffeine tolerance (cultivated through years of drinking "too much" coffee) so while this is fine for me, my teenage son tried one before his workout and got "jittery". Also, while not an issue about the drink, the can is made of very thin aluminum and is prone to ripping if you crush it, causing sharp edges that can (and did) cut fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great tasting energy drink that really does get you moving! It is so good that I put in automatic reorder so a cases arrives every month!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I got my first Celcius at Costco, but they only had Green Tea and Orange Soda flavors.  I didn't even know there was a cola flavor, until I won the Celcius Challenge.  Both flavors are good, but I really like Cola, and I've been giving up soda recently, so this was perfect.  There is no phosphoric acid like there is in regular cola drinks.  It's not exactly the same taste as Pepsi, but it tastes good.  I have one every morning in the car on the way to the gym.

review/text: Of the three flavors of Celsius I have tried (orange, raspberry tea and now cola) the cola is the best tasting.  Although if you mix the orange with some diet Sunkist soda that's not bad either.<br /><br />I drink one can a day, about 20 minutes before I work out.  I have noticed an improvement in my workouts (improved strength and endurance).  Furthermore, drinking Celsius has been a contributing factor in my ability to lose 23 pounds over the last 4 months.<br /><br />I believe if consumed in moderation, adding Celsius to your diet can be very beneficial.

review/summary: This drink is awesome
review/text: I have been drinking Celsius for over a year.  I initially tried it because of the claim that each can burns 100 calories.  I believe it to be true because the pounds came off.  What I like most though is I work out quite a bit, am not a health nut or gym jockey, but when you walk 1-5 miles on a treadmill and find you burn 100-150 calories per mile and then think I can burn 100 calories just by drinking a can of Celsius which by the way is a hec of a lot easier than walking a mile, it becomes somewhat clear this is a great drink.  For the record, I love the Cola the best, most of the other flavors are pretty good, the only one I did not care for was the Ginger Ale.

review/text: I particularly like the Cola, my taste preference, but also like Orange Cola and am okay with Wildberry Cola, Lemon Lime Cola, and Gingerale Cola.  I haven't tried the two teas but I am not a tea fan.  I really like the Cola taste and am not particularly a cola fan such as Pepsi Cola or Coca Cola (diet or not).  I will drink the diet colas such as Coke and Pepsi but not on my list of really like the drinks.  Yet I really like the Celsius Cola.  I also like the energy level it gives me with no crash effect later.  Lastly, I like the healthy ingredients it has too.  For a carbonated alternative that tastes great, gives a great energy level w/ no crash, burns calories vs consuming calories or having empty calories, and has very healthy ingredients; what more could we ask for in a carbonated beverage these days.  Great advancement and option for the health conscience consumer that wants to get a lot out of a product (taste, energy w/no crash effect, negative calories, and healthy ingredients).  Wow, what an offering vs other products on the market that have select pieces of these yet Celsius has it all wrapped up with there product. And they have a good selection of flavors and the carbonated or teas.  Hopefully, they can broaden this product more so others can enjoy these benefits but that are not carbonated or tea drinkers but enjoy coffees and other non-carbonated drinks.<br /><br />I usually drink 1 to 2 a day most days to get the energy and healthy impacts I want in my day and life.

review/summary: Organic Mashed Potatoes... Life is Good : )
review/text: These are a staple in our pantry.  I love mashed potatoes, but who has time for scrubbing and prepping potatoes (Except for the holidays!)?  And up until I found these I would not buy the conventional brands of instant mashed potatoes.  Mainly because they are not organic and also because they don't taste very good.  Potatoes are on the top 12 list of vegetables with the most pesticides; stick with organic!  The Edwards and Sons Organic Mashed Potatoes taste really good!  Granted nothing beats scratch made mashed potatoes, but these are the best of the instant.  They are excellent made with milk and butter, but they are also great with rice milk (if you are vegan or have a dairy issue) and no butter.  Actually, my husband has said that they seem to mix up nicer with rice milk.  We have found that when using the specified amounts of liquid, the mashed potatoes are very thick, so we add more milk or rice milk than directed.  The instant potatoes also work great as a thickener for stews, soup, and gravy.  The flavor is mild, but tasty with a bit of onion and black pepper.  There is also a "chreesy" (non-dairy cheese flavored) version, which I don't like as much.  Our daughter likes the chreesy version better however.  These are also gluten free!  I was buying them by the case from an online discount vitamin store, but Amazon seems to be coming down on their food prices and with Subscribe and Save, they currently have the best price.

I used 1 1/2 cup water and 4 tablespoons of Earth Balance vegan butter because I love buttery mashed potatoes.

review/summary: Fast and Flavorful
review/text: Who knew they made organic instant potatoes? In this variety, you combine the potato flakes with butter (or substitute), hot water, and milk (or dairy substitute), and stir. My first impression was impressed by the glorious potato/onion enhanced flavor compared to the other brands of instant potato I was used to getting. That may be because those other brands use dehydrated milk "Just Add Water!" recipes that are not as fresh. Adding fresh milk and butter makes a load of difference.<br /><br />It includes a fair amount of black pepper and salt in the mixture. This is not for a no-salt diet. One serving bears 190 milligrams of sodium, but I gobbled down 2 servings without batting an eye. I always add pepper to my potatoes so it was pleasing to me, but beware of you do not like the spice. An added bonus in the lack of MSG in these potatoes. Normally a struggle to locate instant potatoes without MSG, these leave me feeling light and alert.<br /><br />There's nothing like the real thing but for a healthier twist on the pantry staple, give these a shot. Don't be scared of the price tag - an extra dollar per packet is worth it for your health.

review/text: My wife and I just love these instant potatoes.  They are best with evaporated milk or evap. milk and fresh milk (50/50).  We use cholestrol free/sugar free evap. milk and 2 percent fat fresh milk and it comes out really excellent.  Don't chintz on the butter either!  Follow directions exactly and you will be very, very pleased.

review/summary: Fast, healthy, tastes good
review/text: I wanted an organic instant potato for emergency food and for when I'm in a hurry.  This mixes a bit differently than other boxed potatoes I'm familiar with, but when I follow the directions, it works perfectly.  The taste is a bit oniony, but even though we're not fans of onions, we still like it.

review/summary: The art of Dried Mashed Potatoes, perfected at last
review/text: Very good flavor indeed from this product.  The potatoes are, I'm sure, of fine grade, but it's the hint of spices and herbs that makes this into anything from a side dish to a stew thickener to a quick comforting snack.  Truly a multi-purpose product, whose uses are limited mostly by the cook's imagination.  Hope you like potatoes!

review/summary: really....
review/text: I received this product the other day, and when I opened the box it came in I literally laughed out loud. These things are TINY!!! I almost instantly regretted spending over 10 dollars for a mere 24 servings when you can buy a box with 20 servings for less than 5 bucks and the grocery store. But I kept them to try them anyway.<br /><br />Pro's: 1. there's a little bag inside of the little box, which I find useful since I hate trying to pour all of those little flakes out of that little whole. So I can take the bag out, cut a bigger hole and they pour a lot better.<br /><br />Con's: 1. Preseasoned. I don't like pepper in my mashed potatoes... or at least not that much.<br />2. Obviously, it's a small box, and for me many con's come along with that.<br />3. It's very expensive!!!<br /><br />And as for being organic.... All that's in Hungry Jack's Potato Flakes is... POTATOES...!!! That's good enough for me, I don't want added salt, added pepper, etc. Also, I had a professor who once said "Coal is organic, would you eat that too?". The term "Organic" has become a major selling strategy over the past few years, and frankly I wouldn't buy much into this one. I mean... they're good... just not "buy again" good. Or at least not for me.

review/summary: the BOSS with mashed banana
review/text: I saw this at the grocery store, with a coupon, so I decided to try it. GENUIS! I have used it successfully in smoothies, but my favorite application is mixed with mashed banana, on a whole grain waffle or just eaten with a spoon (generally 1/4 to 1.3 of the banana per serving). My 1yr old son loves it too. I know he needs the fat, so he gets the real kind most of the time, but when we are out, he loves my PB2 as well. I think I'm going to bring some on vacation with us...

review/summary: PB2
review/text: I was introduced to PB2 during a WW meeting.  I made an immediate purchase and shared it at work.  It's the best in smoothies, yogurt or prepared as spreadable peanut butter.  I love that it does not have any added chemical ingredients.  Only 1.5g fat, 1 g of sugar and 94 mg sodium/serving make it a healthy choice.

You can mix it with as little/much water as you want so you get the consistency you like and use it on anything!  It basically tastes exactly like peanut butter, just without the sugar - so if it's not sweet enough for you, you can add in a packet of splenda.  It's great!

review/text: This is a great product. I already have a diet high in nuts and seeds (Almonds, walnuts, Brazil, Chia), but nothing beats the taste of Peanuts. I don't like adding the extra calories from peanuts, so this is perfect for me.  I add this to smoothies all the time and it tastes great. I also use it as a late night snack on apples or celery. My only gripe is that I wish they made a sugar-free version.

It was so much cheaper to purchase the 16oz bag and it tastes great. It makes a great sandwich and I even put some of the peanut butter powder in my frosting to make a great peanut butter frosting. You don't miss all the fat from the regular peanut butter as it has a great taste still.

review/text: I have tried all the strange alternatives out there with a sincere, want to love this enthusiasm.  My addiction to peanut butter is finally fulfilled.  I can mix it, cook with it, put it in shakes, sprinkle it over ice cream - ANYTHING.  I absolutely love this product and will continue to be a faithful customer.<br /><br />The fat/calorie content is negligible compared to jar PB but the taste doesn't show.  Contrary to another post I think this actually does taste like the natural brand jar PB's although you do have to play with the water ratio but that's whats great, I can dilute just a bit more and then make a creamy peanut sauce.  I hands down recommend this if you are a true PB lover but hate the calories and high fat.

review/text: The taste and creaminess is slightly different from the real thing.. I mix it with about twice as much water as the jar calls for. I like it best on crackers, smoothies or other recipes so it certainly fits the bill in my opinion. My 2 yr old is none the wiser so for that reason alone I'd continue buying it. One of the negative reviews sited an 'aftertaste' as a reason it's bad, but all PB's have that. Drink some water if that bothers you.;) All in all bell plantation knocked it out of the park compared to other PB substitutes. LOVE the fact that I don't have to trade hours at the gym for getting my PB fix anymore!!

review/text: This is fantastic just as their chocolate powder. If it's really 85% less calorie and fat, I will eat it with a spoon,a big one) with no reservations. Being constantly on some type of diet, it is a real find. I am really glad I came across of it looking for a fat free calorie free, low calorie search. It tastes spot on like peanut butter. I used it first with Yonanas mixer (and chocolate one too) and it worked out rather well with bananas and berries (very little berries, or otherwise the taste clashes) One little critics I have is the packaging. I had trouble opening it, so in the end I had to cut it. Now it sits open and I would rather have it tight closed. Any ideas? (except zip lock bag)? Next time I think I will buy it in a jar. And I will buy it again. Actually I just had a thought, I think I will put it in recycled Yankee candle jar. That would work.

review/text: This product is NOT peanut butter.<br /><br />It's powdered peanut butter. And that's why it's so great!<br /><br />If you're looking for a lower fat, diet/calorie friendly option to spreadable, creamy, delightful peanut butter that's not chemically altered or filled with weird ingredients... you've arrived! Simply mix this stuff with water and you've got a spreadable substitute!<br />This product really shines in a myriad of ingredients-- frostings become fantastically peanut buttery without heaviness or an additional caloric load. Smoothies become creamy shakes. Make peanut butter cookies with this as your flour and your mind will be blown with peanut butter presence.<br />The aroma and the hint of peanut butter flavor are the stars in PB2. Eating them side by side is like drinking half and half, and then expecting 2% to taste the same. If this type of comparison is hard for you to notice, then you'll love PB2!<br /><br />But remember, it's NOT peanut butter. Don't go expecting it to have the mouth-feel of full fat, smooth ground peanuts. Just relish the fact that this product exists, and use it where it really shines.<br /><br />P.S. You're always a Google search away from a PB2 recipe.

When I couldn't find it, I was very pleased to see it available through Amazon Prime.  I love love love peanut butter.  But, I can't eat too much because of all the fat.  This product was a joy to find.  It tastes very good.  And, it was fun to discover that I could create exactly the texture that I preferred - just add a little more or little less water.  I can use the peanut butter exactly the "normal" way: on sandwiches, a dip for apples, in sauces and soups; it works great. Hurrah!  All the taste and healthy protein; less fat!

review/text: I got this PB2, from a recommendation of many friends.  I was very skeptical because after all, its a powder!  But when I put a spoonful of this in my protein shakes, or sprinkle some on a sunday, it is delish!  Plus when one serving of "regular" ice cream is only 1 tablespoon, you get FOUR servings of PB2 for the same calories!  It is yummy and my children love it.  And since I care what they put in their bodies, I don't mind as much when they snack on PB2 and crackers or PB2 and jelly sandwiches, etc, because this is so much healthier (85% less fat!) than regular fat-filled peanut butter.  I am never going back to the other stuff.

I run frozen bananas through our juicer to make 'soft serve' and sprinkle/stir this in and the result is awesome!! I've had it on a sandwich with Nutella and that was outstanding too. I don't think I could ever go back to regular PB again. This packaging is a little awkward, once I cut it open, I put it in a plastic container to stay fresh. There is no resealing the package.

review/summary: tastes great and is lower in calories!
review/text: a nutritional newsletter mentioned this and I thought it would be interesting to try.<br />have to say it tastes great to me - although I reconstitute it with twice as much water as the package recommends.<br />think it will be really nice on hiking trips!

review/summary: Yes to peanut butter!
review/text: Absolutely love the powdered peanut butter.  I add it to my protein shakes for the extra protein and for the wonderful taste it adds to the shake.  I'm a huge peanut butter lover, and the fact that I can eat it without the extra calories and fat is GREAT.  Highly recommend!

review/text: i first bough this because i was going on a diet and needed healthy substitutes for what i already eat and this was perfect! it tastes almost exactly like peanut butter with almost none of the fat or calories? you cant beat that when you're dieting which is really the only reason someone would order peanut butter online lets be honest :)

review/summary: A dieter's dream.
review/text: I discovered this while browsing through sugar free and low cal foods on amazon.  When I first tried it, I must admit I was a little turned off.  I couldn't decide whether I liked it or hated it.  But over time, I have grown to love this stuff.  I am on a high protein/low carb diet and normally peanut butter would be out of the question due to its high fat and calorie content.  That's what makes this stuff so great.  Sure its not as good as peanut butter but when is a low calorie version ever better than the original?  It's a great snack and takes away my cravings instantly.  I can eat it anytime of the day without feeling guilty.  I try to keep it between 1 and 2 servings which is just 45-90 calories.  The additional protein it gives me is a bonus.  I just ordered 3 more.

review/summary: good substitute
review/text: i have really enjoyed this product. i love peanut butter and this allows me to eat it without so many calories. in fact, i ran out and bought natural pb to get me through and it is very oily. the oils are good for you, but now i prefer PB2. the price is higher than on bell plantation's website. however once you add in shipping charges, i am only paying about 75cents more per bag since we're prime members. would totally recommend it. you make it as runny or thick as you want.

review/summary: GET IT TODAY!!!!
review/text: If youre on a low cal diet (or any diet!) and you crave peanut butter, GET THIS!! You mix 2 tbsp of the powder with 1 tbsp of water. Its super creamy and absolutely delicious! If it isn't sweet enough for you, try to add one packet of splenda or sweet n low! Will buy again and again! You can't beat how many calories and fat calories you'll save using this product!! Absolutely LOVED it!
