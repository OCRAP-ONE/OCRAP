review/text: You have to get this if you bake! This makes the BEST pie crust and biscuits ever. We also switched from  butter to coconut oil for frying eggs and it requires a lot less to get the job done. Great product and I will be buying more when we run out. Oh, also I am an extremely picky eater and coconut is a flavor I can not tolerate at all...I can not taste any coconut flavor using this so I'm a very happy camper.

review/summary: Amazing on the face, body, and on food!
review/text: I adore this coconut oil.  It smells incredible, tastes delicious, and adds a lovely sheen to your skin.  I put this on my face before washing it to clean off makeup and regularly use this as a body lotion after showering and to remove eye makeup.  It makes your skin wonderfully soft and yummy-smelling and doesn't have any difficult to pronounce ingredients like regular body lotions do.<br />Also, I use this as a topping for air-popped popcorn (since it's oil, it doesn't have water and doesn't make popcorn soggy - butter does this), and I put it on bread in place of butter since it melts faster and is tasty, and I use it in the pan to cook stir-fry, eggs, and anything else I want to cook!  All in all, this stuff is awesome!  I just wish it came in a better container, but as soon as I run out I'll buy another jug of Nutiva coconut oil (this is my second one).

review/text: This coconut oil is Sooooo GREAT!! It smells so amazing. I apply it to my hair as an light moisturizer oil. I also use it along with my body lotion on my skin. Furthermore I cook with it. I purchase this oil 3 times and gave my boyfriend a 150z jar since he has an extremely dry skin. He loves it. His skin looks much better, less dry, and smoother. He also cooks with it.<br /><br />The value for the 54oz jar is the best. Will buy more in the future!

review/text: I wanted to try this product for mental clarity in my golden years.  I was worried what it would taste like and whether I could use it.  Well -- this is delicious!  I use it instead of butter, especially on toast and hot cereals.  It doesn't make every single thing taste like coconut, it just makes them taste good.  I'll always use it.  Thanks, Amazon.com.

review/summary: Best darn Coconut oil EVER!!!!
review/text: This is soooo delicious. Some reviewed the taste as too coconut, I guess you should complain if you purchased Vegetable oil or Olive oil. But it is COCONUT oil, hence the flavor. I use it on toasted bagels, potatoes, to stir fry string beans/ almond slivers. I've used it in my lotions, and hair conditioner (in its liquid form, I mixed it into the products). When my son was a baby, we used it for his delicate skin instead of baby lotions, a great massage oil for adults as well.

review/summary: Working Nicely for my Dog's Itchy Red Skin
review/text: Based on reviews and information I found online I decided to try putting coconut oil on my poodle's dry itchy skin..she was getting yellow flakey areas and pimple/pustules and was itching and licking all the time. In a matter of hours I started to notice a difference (hardly any licking) and by the next day the color of her skin started to normalize. Overnight the redness seemed to return a bit so I'm going to continue applying it. She likes to have it as a treat on her food as well!<br /><br />I'm SO pleased, and incredibly relieved that I've found something natural that seems to relieve her itching a bit.

review/summary: Tropical paradise on your skin
review/text: I mix a little bit of this with my body lotion and it does wonders for my skin. You don't have to mix it at all and can use it right out of the jar, but this is how I do it.  The smell is incredible and a little goes a long way... I am moisturized all day long.  The downside is I can't apply it to my curly thick hair as a moisturizer because it will get frizzy, and also when I put a little bit on my face I tend to break out...so I only use this as a body lotion and I LOVE it. I live on a island so the smell of the coconut oil keeps all the bugs away...just how I like it : )  Bought this jar in april and still have TONS of it left...

review/text: Great product although this oil does have a mild coconut flavor. Great for me, perhaps not so for others. I was previously using another brand with no coconut taste at all. This purchase was $3 cheaper than buying at my local health food store. So yes I am happy and enjoy the benefits of using an organic coconut oil in my cuisine and lotion.

review/text: I plan to use this in place of canola oil. I just switched to a low-carb diet and this was a recommended product, but I don't know that I would ever want to use anything else! It was all liquid when I opened it up though, not sure if it was just a warm day since it says it is supposed to be solid at less than 76. Really good quality stuff, and that is a lot of oil for $25.

review/summary: Simply THE best tasting!
review/text: I've tried other organic coconut oils, but this is by far, the best tasting one yet!<br /><br />We use this for baking, cooking, as a spread (or mixed in spreads) and even in our huskies' homemade diets.<br /><br />There is a calm scent of coconut when you open the jar... not overbearing at all, while also not bland...and the taste is even better than it smells. It's so good in place (or mixed with) butter and/or olive oil.  I've even used this on orange roughy (and other white fish) and the taste is dreamy...and made a much loved meal even more loved.  --After that meal, my husband even said "when this gets down to 1/3, we will reorder"... he never says this about any "oils".  I don't stop with just fish... this oil gets used (either alone or mixed with other oils) with just about everything that needs oil.<br /><br />I've used this on my skin (and as oil treatment for hair) as well, and love it!  I have very sensitive and prone to dry skin, and this helps.  I'll definitely be using this in my skincare as well.<br /><br />It's a little more expensive than several other brands, but it is so worth it.

review/text: I like the oil a lot. And do everything with it. The only problem I had was with the way the shipping was handled.<br />The box was obviously too big, oil bottles were not wrapped. A few pieces of bobble wrapped throw inside box did not provide any protection. Bottles were arrived crushed to the point almost broken. Fortunately, the oil was solid not liquid, so no leaking. But I did read another reviews about honey, having problem with the way they were shipped, it got spilled all over the place.

review/summary: Fragrance that takes you out of this world!!
review/text: I am so thrilled to have actually bought this oil. I wouldn't have done it had I not read the reviews of others so thanks to all of them!!  This oil is so pure, untouched, and it smells so perfect. It has delicate coconut aroma, and a taste that is similar to eating tender coconut.<br /><br />I would buy this again and again and again. For anyone who is looking for perfect coconut oil, this one is for you! You will never regret it.

I use it for sauteing,for making a low-carb chocolate candy, in a low-carb molten chocolate cake, as a spread, and I use it for a moisturizer on my skin.  I also thought this is a good value for my money.  I'm completely satisfied with it.

review/summary: Coconut oil fan, here
review/text: I really like to use coconut oil for baking. It produces a much lighter end product than shortening does, and it's much better for you. Also, surprisingly, there's no heavy coconut taste. For health purposes, I also stir a teaspoonful into my coffee in the morning. Nutiva Coconut Extra-Virgin Oil works just fine. My only gripe: unlike with olive oils, as far as I know, there's no such thing as EXTRA virgin coconut oil. It's the same thing as virgin coconut oil. I suppose they label it that way for marketing purposes, but I never like to promote a myth. In any case, Nutiva works in every way that I expect it to, and buying the 54 ounce jar of Nutiva is the most economical way that I have found to buy it.

review/text: I've tried two of the major coconut oil brands that I order via the internet. I've been using the oil in food and on my skin for about 5 years. I ordered this just to see how it tasted because the price was so good, if it didn't taste right, I'd just use it on my skin. It is the BEST tasting oil I've tried. Tropical Traditions, Coconut Oil Supreme pale in comparison. This is truly a coconut oil you could eat right out of the jar. If you want to try a coconut oil that tastes as good as it smells, this is it. And the price is fabulous. Yea, Nutiva and Amazon!

review/text: I love this coconut oil!  It has a delicate coconut aroma and flavor. I have only just started using it but have found it to be delicious when making pancakes in lieu of using butter.  I have also used it as a substitute for butter when making grilled cheese sandwiches and baked sweet potatoes. It will do wonders for your hair and skin too.  I especially like using it as a hot oil treatment for my hair. I mix the coconut oil with a few drops of lemon essential oil and rub it into my hair.  It smells like dessert and good for my hair and scalp. Try it with your favorite essential oils!<br /><br />Warning:  It melts at 76F.  Be careful when opening a jar that's been sitting in a warm cupboard.

review/summary: It's a win win thing.  And I even like the smell!
review/text: The skin is a great delivery system for absorbing things into your body. So what are you putting on your skin? Read the ingredients on your handcream or body lotion.  Are they good for you?  Don't know?  Can you even pronounce them?  Let's keep it simple.  Virgin organic coconut oil.  Snowy white, unrefined, heavenly smell - this stuff is terrific!!  Solid at room temperature, smooth and buttery and melts at 76 degrees; cook/fry with it on low heat for a healthy and fragrant alternative to all those ulgy refined oils and hydrogenated trans fats (YUCK!), use as a lighter butter or shortening alternative (there's not a lot of flavor and the smell is intoxicating); use as hand cream (rub it on - only gets greasy if you really over load the area) I use it as a body lotion all over my body (my skin feels soft and smooth like it did when I was a child), hair conditioner (a light deep conditioner); anti-fungal properties (put it between your toes for goodness sake!) make-up remover - voila!  ear wax? I put a tiny bit of this on a q-tip; moist toilette wipes? ssshh... try a touch of this on your t.p. - and I could go on and on...  It must be organic and virgin coconut oil - anything else is something else and unexceptable.  I understand that it is fine for diets, and speeds up the metabolism (its those little medium fatty acid chains). Don't take my word for it - read all about it for yourself!  And yes, I feed it to my dog and cat, my cat loves it - and he won't eat anything! Actually, I don't think that he can resist the smell, I can't! Another one of those items that I out on my favorite things list!

review/summary: THIS STUFF IS INCREDIBLE!!!
review/text: This is amazing.  I like it better than all other coconut oils.  Of course it tastes like coconut.  I don't want to use oils that are so overly processed and refined that they taste like "nothing".  I don't understand why the coconut flavor bothers some people.  If you don't like coconut, find a different oil.<br /><br />You can use this for grilling, frying, baking, sauteeing, greasing & flouring a cake pan, and all other places that you'd use butter or a Crisco-type product.  Just be careful on the baking because this melts at a low temperature.<br /><br />It is amazing as a skin softener, a hair conditioner, a leave in hot oil treatment, make-up remover, eyelash conditioner/glosser, shaving "cream", lip softener, cuticle oil, nail conditioner, bath oil, after bath oil, massage oil (add a few drops of essential oil if you wish), etc.  Speaking of massage oil, this is an excellent product for "adult activities" . . . as a perk it is definitely edible.<br /><br />If you have dry feet, slather this on, rub it in, wrap your feet with plastic wrap, cover with socks, and go to bed.  In the morning your feet will feel nice and soft.<br /><br />This can be used on leather such as shoes, jackets, and purses.  Because it's clear, you can use it on leather products that have decorative stitching that you can't cover with regular colored polish.  (In fact, I just bent over and put coconut oil on my black leather shoes with my fingers . . . the only clean up needed was to rub my hands together.)<br /><br />I've even used it on my wood furniture to obtain the same results as furniture oils.  I have used it to grease hinges and mechanical parts.  I have heard that you can use it to add lustre to pearls but I'm too chicken to try it on my good stuff.<br /><br />I know people that have used it as a laxative (in large quantities) and a diet aid.  When I eat about a T. a day my skin is softer and my wrinkles are less noticable.<br /><br />I keep finding new uses.  I'm sure you'll find some, too.

review/summary: Endless uses!  Great product! You gotta try it.
review/text: This is the best brand! [[ASIN:B000VUMSE0 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 54 oz]I have been using more and more coconut oil for the past for months. First it was for facial moisturizer than learned how great it is for a whole body moisturizer. Use as you would baby oil. The I tried for my baby who has eczema and is allergic to just about all the "pure" and "natural" products out there. His skin drinks it in and leaves it super moisturized and smooth. No more cracks and irritation. Great for all seasons. My husband uses after shaving as do I. I love it for cooking, No more olive and canola. If you do your research this should be your only cooking oil. Whether savory or sweet or deep frying and sauteing. Has a very mild taste, my husband doesn't even notice the difference. Also try in your hair as a conditioner, hot oil treatment or sealant also cuticles. I am an african american woman with natural 4a hair. I can't say enough about this. I started with the 16oz, but the more I used this the more I found that I needed a larger size. To my amazement I found this gigantic size. I put some in my smaller containers and leave one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom, one in the baby room and the largest one in the kitchen. Can't get enough of coconut oil.

review/summary: No worries about plastic leaching
review/text: I wrote this to ease the worries of those who read some of the lower starred reviews complaining about the plastic container and possible "leaching" of harmful byproducts into the oil.  Turn your Nutiva jar upside down and read inside the little recycle triangle.  See the little "1" symbol and the PETE written under it?  That's a good plastic:  "#1 is Polyethylene Terephthalate, also marked as PET or PETE. Companies normally use this plastic for various beverage containers such as water, soft drinks, and sport drinks. You can also find this plastic for ketchup, peanut butter, salad dressings, jellies, and various other condiments. This plastic is known as one of the "good" plastics since it is not known to leach, or gradually penetrate, chemicals into the products it houses." [...]<br /><br />Also, don't worry about the clear container--coconut oil is highly resistant to becoming rancid from heat/light, unlike olive, corn, and other oils.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Can't Beat Nutiva's Organic Coconut Oil for Taste or Texture
review/text: I first tried coconut oil last fall after reading The Coconut Oil Miracle (***highly recommended book***) and Nutiva's Organic Coconut Oil was the first I tried. It spoiled me completely. I've since tried two other brands and NOTHING tastes as fresh and light as this oil.  It has a nice coconut flavor and personally, I love the taste it gives fried eggs and even pancakes.  I also used it to make a pie crust (after chilling the oil slightly to compensate for the friction of working the pie crust) for a coconut cream pie and it was out of this world--flaky and delicious!!!  Like another poster, I also like it spread on a toasted English muffin and then topped with a light drizzle of honey.<br /><br />Our family has changed our eating habits in the last year and now we use only 3 fats:  1.  Coconut Oil 2.  Butter 3.  Extra Virgin Olive Oil (but only raw---never with heat!!!!--use the coconut oil or butter for fried & sauteed foods).  Our general health is much improved; my husband's cholesterol levels are finally dropping (after YEARS of using "SmartBalance" and other "healthy" spreads that just raised his cholesterol).<br /><br />Try this coconut oil and do yourself a favor and order <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)</a>so you can understand why it not only tastes so good, but is so good for you!

review/summary: If you like coconut, this oil is great!
review/text: It has a slight coconut taste, but not overpowering.  I originally first tried the stuff at Walmart, and it had no flavor to it at all, very bland.<br /><br />To combat some of the poor reviews I read on this oil, I think a lot of those are just due to people not doing their research before buying, and thus they're just being snippity pickeys.  Obviously since it has a coconut taste, you may not want to use it for all your cooking needs.  When I cook Italian foods, I use olive oil.  When making something like mayonaise, I use canola oil.  A little common sense doesn't hurt most folks.  (It tastes great on toast with a little cinnamon sprinkled on it.)<br /><br />As for it being hard as a rock....I haven't noticed that.  Scoops out very easily. But again, a little research, and you'll find that it is a solid until the temperature reaches approximately 76-78�F, then it turns liquid.  Thus, there shouldn't be much of an issue of "melting it" to cook something as one person stated.  Any other type of oil you usually  heat before you start cooking.<br /><br />It does work great as a lotion on your skin.  It actually absorbs into the skin, and after it's absorbed, it doesn't leave an oily residue like you'd think it would.  I would recommend doing it at night before bed, or if you have some time before going out or whatever, because it's not instantly absorbed.  And a little goes a long way.  Leaves skin very smooth.<br /><br />I've also started using this in my hair after I wash/condition it.  Again, it actually absorbs into the hair and doesn't appear oily.  I use it only on the middle to the ends.  I've noticed my hair is softer, very shiny, and it helps bring out my natural curls without looking as frizzy.  It also makes me long hair much easier to comb.  Obviously, use in moderation, again a little will go a long way, a light coating is all that's needed.  And, it washes out fairly easy.  If you use too much, you'll feel it, and just do a second shampoo rinse.<br /><br />My dogs also get a teaspoon every day, and look forward to it.<br /><br />For those that say they're going to stick to butter, so be it.  You already know that's bad for you.  And margarine...even worse.  I think it's high time people started looking back to the "old days" and other countries that don't have the health problems we do here in the "industrialized" world.  Not saying coconut oil is the savior, but I think it's a good start.<br /><br />Cheers!

review/text: This is my favorite coconut oil for eating and moisturizing both.  It is unrefined virgin coconut oil and has that great coconut smell (and taste!).  If you want odorless / tasteless coconut oil - make sure you purchase the REFINED coconut oil.<br /><br />Coconut oil has never made me nauseous and this one is no different - it's one of the best, highest quality oils I've ever had and I highly recommend from everything from cooking (does not degrade at high heat like olive oil) to moisturizing (coconut glow and super shiny hair!).<br /><br />Bought a smaller size initially and went through it in no time flat. The gallon size lasts me a good 3-4 months (cooking and moisturizing).<br /><br />Editing this on 05/19/2012: "perfect price" at the time, by the way, was $56.15 shipped via Amazon Prime.

review/summary: Miracle product
review/text: I hate when people throw around the words Miracle Product about anything.  It sounds so douchey.  So... I've decided that would be the title of my review.  I think in general, coconuts are one of the most insanely useful nuts/fruits/things(?) found in nature.  Coconut water is extremely delicious (Amy & Brian's brand or C2O, the other brands can be meh), coconut milk is a great substitute for milk in certain non-dairy applications for all you hipster vegans, and Tom Hanks made a best buddy out of a whole coconut.<br /><br />Coconut oil, when it comes in the pressed extra virgin form, like with Nutiva or the other kinds you can purchase thru GNC, Vitamin World, etc. is also a miracle product.  It has a lot of applications.  It stays solid at room temperature which is pretty gnarly.  That's not a pro nor a con, just wanted to get that out there.  Knocking over an open container of this oil doesn't mean you have a mess to clean up, it just means your a klutz.  It's great for hair care, so say my black friends.  I have pretty thick hair so I don't really need it for that.  It's awesome for skin care too, like for acne scarring or minor skin blemishes.  It's completely anti-fungal and antibacterial so that means it's an all natural lubrication.  That last one was not something I have any personal experience with either, it's just something I wanted to type to make any readers still here uncomfortable.  But it's true according to many "What to use coconut oil for" websites.  It's also good to add as a means of healthy fat to a protein shake or vegetable concoction a la Joe Rogan Experience kale shakes in the morning.  Lastly, the real thing I use it for, is baking.  It's a substitute for butter at a ratio of 1:1, and a substitute for shortening at .75:1, meaning 3/4 cup of coconut oil is 1 cup of shortening.  Check this page out:<br />[...]<br /><br />The ChezUs recipe for banana bread is awesome.  Ok, I'm not writing any more stuff about coconut oil, don't be so goddamn lazy, go research (google) it on your own.  I was just supposed to write 20 words on this product but started my rant.  Buy it.  Or don't.  I don't really care what you do.  But if you do buy it, buy the 54 fl oz. jar like I did because it doesn't really spoil, more is better, and because I said so.

review/summary: The Only Coconut Oil I'll Ever Use!
review/text: When it arrived the oil was melted but that was to be expected after walking around with it going to class in SC. When I got back to my dorm it was already beginning to thicken up. I was also very happy to see that there was no spill. I got this coconut oil to use in my hair and I could not be happier. My hair is really soft and it seems like its melts away kinks and tangles that can come with hair 7 weeks post relaxer. My hair is super soft, moisturized, and shiny. I'm also seeing less breakage and shedding. At first I thought the oil smelled weird, but it's probably because I don't know what fresh coconut smells like. It smells spicy like pumpkin at first and then I smell coconut and I'm like ooooooh okay, that smells really good. I plan on buying a fresh coconut just so I can know what it smells like. It also feels great on my skin; it soaks in almost instantly and leaves my skins soft while feeling like I didn't put anything on at all. Before I did anything with it, I tasted it, to me it didn't taste like anything, it was only a little though. I'll probably still buy a separate jar for food purposes because of the health benefits.<br />All in all I'm extremely happy with this purchase and I will only buy this brand of coconut oil. I bought coconut oil from a natural diy/aromatherapy site that wasn't living up to the known benefits of coconut oil when used in your hair, it also wasn't unrefined and I think it is the cause of seborrheic dermatitis that I'm currently dealing with. But since I've stopped using that coconut oil that issue is just about nonexistent. So make sure what ever oil you are using is unrefined and organic!

review/summary: I keep coming back to Nutiva
review/text: I've tried other brands of VCO, but I keep coming back to Nutiva. It's well blended and smooth, and the flavor is the best of all I've tried. I love it and use it for all kinds of cooking. It's especially good for cooking bitter greens like turnips or collards; the coconut taste helps cut the bitterness, giving a marvelous flavor to the greens.<br /><br />I've discovered a fantastic way to make healthy popcorn using VCO. I've tried the stovetop method in the past using olive oil, but it's always burned my pot. What I do now is put a great heaping tablespoon of VCO into my 10-quart Fagor canning pot, melt it at 390 on my induction burner, dump in popcorn kernels to just cover the bottom in a single layer, and put on a glass lid I have that fits the pot. Then I just follow through with the popping process, jiggling the pot a little to keep the unpopped kernels falling to the bottom as the kernels pop. I listen for the popping to slow, just like you do with microwave popcorn, and then just turn off the induction burner and let the pot sit a minute while the last few kernels pop. This makes a wonderfully VCO-coated popcorn that can be enjoyed without salt if necessary, or add just a little fine popcorn salt and toss.

review/summary: Miracle oil
review/text: Coconut oil is a miracle. It's good to ingest or use on the skin. I cook with it, and use it like butter. plus its great for dry skin. I have a chronic dry spot under my eye which at times turn red and dry to the point of the skin flaking. I tried petroleum jelly, lotions, coco-butter and all kinds of moisturizers on it for years then I started using coconut oil on it. The Coconut oil moisturized it and the dry spot is not noticeable at all anymore. It's worth using. Google the properties of it and I'm sure you'll agree.

review/text: I use this for hair, skin, supplement holistically, and even the DOG! Truly natures best substance! I have IBD and a tablespoon every other day has lessened my abdominal issues so I gave my dog some after a trashitis attack and she loves the taste and ate on her own and stomach was fine the next morning! No more $1200 vet bills for that issue and her sadness from the face cage. Tastes and smells wonderful, just like coconut. Not at all petroleum greasy on skin and hair. ordering 3rd jar so I will have a good stock on hand.

review/summary: Yum.  Goodbye Crisco!
review/text: The other reviewers weren't kidding.  I could seriously eat this stuff with a spoon.  It's glorious.  I've stopped using Crisco and started using Nutiva Certified Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil in place of it.  I haven't found a recipe yet where it didn't work.  It does lend a coconut flavor to everything, so if coconut's not your thing, this may not be a great product for you.

review/summary: Goodbye hypothyroidism!
review/text: I don't have to reiterate all the known benefits of coconut oil, the effects are well known. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in 2010, and had been suffering from weight gain and sluggishness since. I read about how the oil could treat hypothyroidism so I started taking a tablespoon on toast every morning. Fast forward to 2012, and my thyroid test says my thyroid is perfect. My doctors were stumped. Couldn't be happier with the product. Tastes great too.

review/summary: Delicious Product!!
review/text: I recently heard about the great benefits of coconut oil and was wanting to give it a try.  I first bought a small jar from my local Walmart.  It had no flavor whatsoever and I felt like I was missing something.  Come to find out I needed Organic, Cold Pressed, Extra Virgin coconut oil.  The ones I found were not.  It was suppose to have a delicious coconut smell and light flavor.  I came to Amazon because I appreciate being able to read reviews of buyers before actually spending my money on an item.  Nutiva is an exceptional product.  Exactly what I was looking for. I am now addicted to toast with coconut oil(in place of butter) and jelly.  OMG!  I can't get enough.  I crave it every morning.  I was scared of all the saturated fats until I learned that not all saturated fats are bad for you (contrary to popular beliefs).  The studies that have been done on people for lowering the bad cholesterol and other benefits sold me. I would compare it to how the medical profession said eggs were bad for you and now they say they are good for you.  I am almost out and am definitely buying more.  Maybe the smaller containers though just to make it easier to reach the bottom with my teaspoon. Great product!

review/text: This is my first time trying coconut oil. I can not believe how great it tastes. Almost as good as butter. Sure hope it as healthy as it has been declared.It does not have to be refrigerated. But if room temperature is about 77 degrees it will turn to liquid. So I refrigerate it on the hot days so I can use it as a spread for my bagel.

This is what theaters used to make popcorn back in the day.  For the first time in years we had real popped corn instead of microwave popcorn. OMG!!! The taste is fantastic, no need for butter, a great healthy snack rich in fiber.

review/summary: Coconutty, mmmmmm.
review/text: The oil was just right, very good texture/smell.  Great size- it's a two hander.  Works not only as a supplement, but also as a moisturizer for skin/hair as well. This oil is mild, not overwhelming in the least when used as a butter substitute or while cooking; you really can eat this straight off the spoon if you're so inclined. I was able to convince a skeptical man and two little ones to eat this. They love it and request it when given a choice between butter or oil. It's worth a try and there is a multitude of research in support of the health benefit(s) from adrenal/thyroid to dental maintenance... This has got to be one of the most painless ways to eat healthier.

review/summary: candida diet
review/text: I have been using this product for cooking and putting it on sprouted bread for awhile now.  I stopped using it about 3 weeks ago because i was craving butter lol.  About 4 days ago, i broke out in a rash under my armpit.  Its a yeast infection!  After researching how to get rid of that (ive been using tea tree oil for that on surface), i started researching candida (fungus/yeast overgrowth) and coconut oil!  To my surprise, by my using it all this time it was keeping the yeast in check enough.  Ive changed my diet slowly and have been eating good with occasional slip ups.  Now the candida is taking over!  Im back to using coconut oil in my foods and will add it more often as i go.  Not just coconut oil, but other virgen coconut products like milk and just plain coconut.  Ordered some probiotics and a detox tea called "holy tea".  Time to get the gut healthy!  MOST americans have an overgrowth of yeast in the body.  After looking at all the symptoms (there are tons of them) seems like its been a problem for awhile now, but who knows until you get "thrush" (white coating on tongue, which my doctor didnt even tell me was from candida) or an armpit rash.  Thank you for selling a product that is healthy and works for so many things!!!!

review/text: Actually, I'm on my 3rd jar of this Coconut Oil.  I use it in cooking, in my coffee, and on my skin.  In fact, this oil has cleared up problems that I have had on my cheeks, little white bumps, almost completely!<br />I love sauteing chicken in the oil as it helps keep it moist and also has a delicious flavor with the chicken; a plus are that the pan scrapings are delish! :)  I also add a teaspoon to each cup of coffee I drink.  I don't use sugar for sweetening but do use half and half but have found that I need less cream when I add the oil.  I started using a tablespoon but that was too much in that I almost couldn't leave the house, if you know what I mean.<br />There is a book I reviewed about coconut oil too so if you are a "coconut oil beginner", I suggest reading the book I reviewed as it has a lot of useful information.

review/summary: Great Decision!
review/text: Over the last few months,I've been becoming more and more aware of the fact that everyday products we use such as our lotions and toothpastes and hair care products etc. are actually items which contain chemicals and products harmful to us such as fluoride for example in toothpastes which is also in water supplies. Being that I'm a male who's only 23, I have slowly wanted to switch to more healthy,organic products for my health and body as I recently did with my toothpaste,a fluoride free brand called Tom's of Maine. I decided to do the same with my lotions and hair care products. I did research of what products,organic,which can also be consumed,can best be used for these purposes,especially hair, and after reading about apple cider vinegar and virgin coconut oil I decided to go with the coconut oil because I can use it on my body as well,and man was it a great decision! The first noticeable thing about the coconut oil is the smell...DELICIOUS. I find myself just opening the top and having a whiff before I'll even use it sometimes. Also,the actual feel and convenience of the product is great. It's a great alternative to high fat butter products. It makes my skin feel smooth and my hair is always soft and my scalp dries nowhere near as horrible as it used to. Really,in this last month,I find it harder and harder to find dandruff present. When I'm out of the shower,I don't have to have 2 or 3 or 4 different bottles for conditioner then grease then lotion,etc. I have it all in this one container! I simply rub a bit in my hands to melt it,massage it through my hair and when I finish my hair,I move to my face and so on. It's great! It smells amazing,it's convenient,and it's healthy in terms of the fatty acids it contains which our bodies need. I know it's "different strokes for different folks",but I'd recommend this oil to anybody. If you use it for foods and personal hygiene like myself,I recommend the 54 oz. container. BTW,super fast shipping! I ordered on a Sunday morning,I had it Tuesday morning and was using it Tuesday night!

The taste is good spread on bread in place of margarine  and mixed in with vegetables.  It needs no refrigeration and works well to fry eggs or grill sandwiches.  It is supposed to be good for the skin also.  Despite a slightly higher cost over butter or margarine it is worth it if our minds improve.  Time will tell...

review/text: This is my first time trying Coconut Oil so I wasn't sure which brand to try first so what my wife and I did was buy this one (Nutiva) and also bought Artisana 100% Organic Raw Coconut Oil Extra Virgin --We read many reviews on both some saying they liked one vs the other so we just decided let's try them both. They arrived today, we opened them both and took our first taste of both. The Artisana brand we both agreed was kinda blah. The Nutiva brand we were both licking our lips because it tasted so much like a Almond joy candy bar. The coconut flavor is delicious!! If you want coconut oil without the coconut taste go for something like the Artisana or maybe another brand, but if your looking for the coconut flavor NUTIVA is the one!!! We will be buying more and will be buying the large size because we know for a fact we will be using this daily.

review/summary: High Quality Coconut Oil
review/text: I purchase coconut oil for non-food purposes - hair, skin, nails, feet; I use a heaping teaspoon in my hair once a week for fifteen minutes, which keeps it incredibly soft and hydrated.  It's great added to a hot bath or used to oil the skin.  Terrific cure for tough feet in just a few applications.  It's definitely helped soften my facial skin and lessen the appearance of fine lines.<br /><br />This particular coconut oil is excellent - very smooth and free of graininess, it melts into a soft pure oil in your hands.  It has a very light, clean, coconut-butter scent - very pleasing.  It's a very large amount for the money and the best quality I've found of the half dozen brands I've tried over the years.

review/summary: ONLY PLASTIC CONTAINER
review/text: I called the company and they said that their products only come in plastic. That's too bad because I like everything their product has to offer. Bummer.

review/summary: Nothing like Nutiva.
review/text: This stuff is nothing short of amazing. I love it and my only grief is that they don't seem to sell it outside of the US, so I have to have folks bring it to me when they come with them on the airplane. I use it as a face moisturizer, to cook, bake, as a hair mask and soon I will be using it as nipple cream for breastfeeding and as baby bum cream. It's the one product I can't live without. The price for the size is a great bargain, because I can pay this much in the health food store for a much smaller size jar. Thank you Amazon.

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: I use this product on my body and hair. IT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!! it moisturizes like no other. i use it on my hair as a light deep conditioner. i put it on my hair before i wash my hair.like a hot oil treatment. i just let it marinate in my scalp and stuff. and then i wash my hair. it leaves it soooo soft and it even detangles!!! and it leaves my hair feeling strong and it is growing. but be careful if u use too much on ur hair it will become very very greasy and heavy. u only need a tad. okay next, i use it on my skin! i wash my face and i put it on my face afterwards. it leaves my face feeling extremely soft, clean and moisturized. also, it doesnt clog my pores. and once or twice a week i will do a soothing bath with the coconut oil. a warm bath mixed with the oil, is sooooo heavenly. Lol. Also use it when i shower too. it leaves my skin feeling soo soft. like i have eczema and it doesnt irritate it at all. my skin loves this stuff. it melts fast and the smell will takes some getting used to. i havent tried cooking with it yet because i really just wanted to use it on my skin cause i have extremely sensitive skin and eczema and i needed something pure and organic. and honestly, i can see my skin clearing up. my eczema is less itchy and actually looks better and is under control. coconut oil is so vital to my everyday skin care regimen. best thing ever.

review/text: First it smells great, taste like butter with a hint of coconut. Its makes my skin soooo soft its great on your hair, in smoothies but I think i'm gonna use the coconut flour for my smoothies instead. I'm very happy with the product overall and my family as well. A little goes a long way.
