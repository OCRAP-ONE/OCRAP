review/summary: Prepare for slime & get your hands wet! My pizza fanatic family love it:)
review/text: We have been on the search for a good gluten free pizza crust for about a year and the first time we tried BRM I did not like it at all.  It was just a slimy mess and I couldn't get it to 'roll' out in the pan.  We were out of the expensive precooked GF crusts and I found a bag of this in the back of the freezer....it was pizza night and we were desperate.  This time I made sure I followed the directions completely and allowed the dough to rise the full time.  I greased my 2 large pizza pans with olive oil.  Having read tips for spreading pizza dough that suggested having very wet hands, I thought I might as well try it.  SLiMy dough and wet hands this is going to be disguisting!  Once I got over the sliminess I found the dough spreads very well by just pressing it out with your wet hands.  Your hands need to be almost dripping wet.  I run my hands under water and lightly tap off some of the water so I don't drip all over.  The dough slides very well!  Once you get the hang of it, spreading the dough is easy.  The good news is my pizza fanatic family loves it.  I've even had gluten eating friends come over for pizza night and they enjoyed it as well.  It works well for leftovers in school lunches too.

review/summary: Really, really good - ignore the negative reviews!
review/text: I hadn't purchased this on Amazon due to the fair number of negative reviews...a big mistake on my part!<br /><br />I generally prefer to blend all of my own flours, but with four young kids, 'life happens' and I need to be more realistic about taking shortcuts where I can find them. We've just moved into a new house, and I wanted to make homemade pizza - but of course all of my gear (including flours) isn't unpacked yet. In a pinch, I picked up a single bag of this at Target to give it a try.<br /><br />It was super! It *is* essential to spread the dough with wet hands...and no, it doesn't handle like regular dough during this process. Then again, what GF dough does? I used egg whites in the recipe, not full eggs due to cholesterol issues and there were no negative consequences.<br /><br />After baking the dough to a nice light golden color, we brushed a light layer of extra-virgin olive oil on it. This was followed by a very light sprinkling of sea salt. We then covered the crust with fresh basil (we happened to have this from our own container garden) and then thin slices/pieces of mozzarella. Tomatoes were eliminated as this mum is on a strict no-sugar diet, but it wasn't missed by anyone -- this was truly delicious!<br /><br />In fact, it was such a hit that we repeated the pizzas a few days later for a family movie night. This time, I purchased two bags of the mix locally - this quantity can easily make three large rectangular pizzas (using standard cookie/jelly roll pans). This amount was plenty for a large family and will be repeated when we have guests over. I should add that I was able to simple double the batch with no negative consequences...sometimes GF recipes are fussy and I'm unable to double- or triple- batches, which is a bummer as it takes much longer.<br /><br />Needless to say, I added this to my subscribe & save orders this morning. It's a great bargain and according to the kids it's 'waaaaayyyyyy better than pizza from Italian restaurants' - and a whole lot healthier, without sacrificing our GF nutritional goals!<br /><br />The next time we make this, I'll upload some pictures. It is so good - and so healthy!

review/summary: First GF pizza I've had
review/text: This product was very easy to prepare.  One warning to those unfamiliar with GF 'dough'...it's more like a very thick muffin batter.<br /><br />While wheat flour has that stretchiness, this does not, simply because it's gluten-free.  I think if I had been more prepared for the consistency, it wouldn't have seemed so odd.<br /><br />That said, it was easy to mix (I did it by hand) and it did rise a bit during the waiting period.<br /><br />I added dried oregano and chopped fresh garlic to mine, and will add more seasonings next time I make it.<br /><br />Spreading the "batter" is not hard, if you are prepared.  I used a cookie sheet and made one rectangular pizza from one package.  Make sure you oil/spray the pan and you will need to spread the mixture using wet hands.  Again, since this is not wheat, you will be doing more spreading and patting down than stretching.<br /><br />You bake the crust first and then add toppings. I used jarred spag sauce, sliced mushrooms, sliced onions and shredded mozz cheese.  Baked it for about 18 minutes and it was perfect.<br /><br />This will not fool anyone into thinking this is a traditional wheat pizza dough.  There is no comparison, as wheat has totally different characteristics than these ingredients.  BUT, this product is great.  Really, it does not have much of any taste at all, and you can add whatever herbs and spices you want to the mixture to customize it.  The texture was slightly crunchy and even my husband loved it.<br /><br />Since this is my first GF mix, I have no other point of reference, so I can't give it 5 stars.  BUT, I will continue to use this product on a regular basis and I'm looking forward to trying the all-purpose flour I ordered at the same time.

review/summary: Great for gluten free pizza
review/text: My 13 year old daughter has to eat gluten free and this pizza dough is great.  I make a 9 X 13 sheet and bake without toppings.  I slice it up individually and freeze separately for later.  When she wants pizza I just pull one out, defrost in microwave, add toppings and bake.  I added a sprinkle of garlic powder before the toppings as she likes the extra garlic.

review/summary: best thin crust gluten free pizza!!
review/text: 1. It's gluten free, which means it will not be exactly like a "real" pizza dough<br />2. It says to use wet hands to spread, but I get the best  results by using a big wet spatula. This way, you can really spread it out to get a nice thin crust.<br />3. My kids love this pizza, which is amazing,since they balk at a lot of gf things.<br />4. You must prebake before adding toppings! Don't skip this step!<br />5. Like most gf,it doesn't work well as  leftovers. Eat while fresh and hot..not as great the next day!<br />6. I always add a touch of olive oil brushed on the crust.. Gives it a touch of fat that makes it just a bit better!

review/text: Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Pizza Crust mix is one of the best purchases I have made of Bob's products. My husband misses pizza and I have made homemade pizza crusts for him. The amount of ingredients needed to make a homemade gluten-free pizza crust is unbelievable. It is also very time consuming to gather all the ingredients. I love the convenience of simply opening a bag of Bob's pizza crust mix and preparing it in my mixer. No muss, no fuss! The taste is great. This bag makes 2 pizzas and they reheat for lunches very well. I will always make sure I have this item in my pantry. I would recommend Bob's Red Mill products to anyone that needs gluten-free products.

The WFGF dough can be hard to work with sometimes but just use water on your hands and smooth the dough onto the pizza pan and you're good to go. We like to bake the crust for about 8 minutes before we put the sauce and toppings on. Delicious and now we can have pizza again! YAY!

review/summary: I'm not GF and I love this!
review/text: I don't have any sort of gluten allergy or intolerance but was looking into GF products just because less gluten seems healthy. Baking has never been my forte so it was a bit scary delving into GF baking, which I know even less about, but this was basically effortless!<br /><br />I bought a single bag of this at Whole Foods to try and I absolutely loved it and ordered a case on Amazon a few days later. I made two decent sized pizzas with the first bag and froze the second one (after baking the crust and putting on the toppings but before actually baking the toppings) and they both turned out amazingly. The dough is softer, stays together well, and the crust is lovely and crunchy. I'm a huge fan.<br /><br />I do prefer letting the dough rise for 30min instead of 20, but it doesn't make a huge difference. Also make sure you spread the dough with wet hands! I usually have to wet them several times while spreading it. And make sure the baking pan is well greased!

review/summary: Fabulous Pizza Crust
review/text: Before making this crust the first time, I read as many of the reviews as possible which was extremely helpful.  Now that I've made it a few times I have started to make some of my own discoveries.  I make the dough exactly the way it tells you to on the package, but I don't divide it before letting it rest for 30 mins.  Also, I don't roll out the dough.  I pretty much just spread it around with the back of a spoon or with my fingertips (keep a bowl of water next to you to dip your fingertips in so the dough doesn't stick to you).  Keep spreading the dough out thinner and thinner to desired thickness.  It does puff up a bit when baked, so the thinner the better.  I have found that you can even stretch the dough so thin that there are holes left in the dough, but once you add toppings no one will ever know.  When cooking the dough, put it in longer than you think you should.  I wait until all the edges are brown, and the middle is starting to color.  My husband was bummed when we first started eating gluten free pizzas (he's not gluten intollerant, just me) because he said they were gummy and gross and had a weird after-taste.  Now that we have this mix, and now that I make the crust super super super thin and crispy, he says he can't even tell a difference.  This mix has definitely been a God-send.

review/summary: A good substitute for wheat pizza crust!
review/text: This is a very good value for a gluten-free pizza dough mix.  One package should make two medium-sized pizzas. I only used half of the pizza dough (I put the rest in the refrigerator) and I ended up with a good-sized round pizza that works perfectly for planning on 8 slices of pizza. I used a mixture of water, ground flaxseed and chia seeds (already gelled) as an egg substitute and it worked fine (actually I think that it improves the pizza crust in that it adds healthy fat and fiber).  Just after I started to  add grated cheese, sauce, spinach and onions, I realized that I was supposed to bake the dough without toppings first.  I turned the oven down to 350 degrees, then I baked the entire pizza with toppings for 25 minutes.  I then turned the oven up to 450 degrees, put the pizza on a lower rack and baked for a little while longer.  It came out crispy and tasty.<br />Backing up the process a little - the dough was easy to work with even though it did separate some.  I didn't use an electric mixer.  I just kneaded the dough with my hands, then let it rise for 20 minutes.  I took a Crisco-greased flat baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal and then created a pizza pie circle of dough with a slightly elevated border of dough with wet fingers.  I also put olive oil all around where the crust was exposed.<br /><br />The overall result was a very tasty and satisfying pizza pie.  It should be noted that this is not low-carb at all, but there is a good amount of fiber in each serving.  One serving is 1/8 of the package or 57g and each serving contains 45g of carbohydrate and 4g of dietary fiber.  The mix contains brown rice, potato starch and flour, millet, sorghum, tapioca, evaporated cane juice, xanthan gum, yeast (separate package), sea salt, guar gum.  There are 200 calories per serving in the dry mix with only 10 calories from fat.<br /><br />There are no soy products or tree nuts in the mix, but the facility manufactures products with these ingredients.<br /><br />Update:<br />I used this pizza crust mix to make a very substantial and delicious gluten free artisan-style bread.  I followed the recipe for the cinnamon buns on the package, but added milk instead of water and only 1 tablespoon of sugar.  I also added whole chia seeds.  The end result was impressive - a gorgeous loaf of bread that would be a great addition to any occasion.  The only thing that I noticed is that the first day that I tried it out, it really sort of swelled in my stomach and created a very almost uncomfortable full feeling - and that was after eating a small amount.<br /><br />Update:  After using this pizza crust mix to create two excellent pizzas, I can highly recommend this product.<br />I stored the other half of the pre-made dough in the refrigerator for several days.  Last night I used a flat baking sheet with a thin layer of olive oil sprinkled in the middle with coarsely ground corn meal (polenta).  I moistened my fingers with water and spread the dough easily into a large circle and then sprinkled olive oil and seasonings on the dough and pre-baked it.  I then added various cheeses and rinsed canned crabmeat, fresh basil and herbs and seasonings.  The result was a very impressive tasting and looking "white" pizza.  This pizza crust mix wins on all counts - taste, ease of use and price.  It costs about $1.25 per medium/large pizza crust with Subscribe & Save.

review/text: Easy, quick, and tastes great.  It's not the same as wheat pizza dough, so don't expect the same flavor or consistency.  I prefer the eggless version (use ground flax & water as egg substitute).  Sticks to hands when spreading on pizza pan, but a little water or oil solves the problem.  Subscribe & Save at Amazon is a great price.

The first time I made it, the texture threw me off a little, but it was OK.  I had major digestion issues for the 12 hours after consuming.  I gave it another chance a few weeks later.  Still just OK.  Edible, but not that good, with major stomach pain after.  I still have two bags of this in my pantry waiting to be used.

I've gone 'outside the box' and went so far as to make cheesy bread and biscuits with the dough as well. Great product.

review/summary: Perfect for our diet.
review/text: My girlfriend and i live a Vegan lifestyle, teetering on plant-based, and the combination of the two means we dont consume oil or eggs, two standards of baking, and ingredients specifically called for here. They suggest replacing eggs with flaxseed meal, which we do, and we use Emergen-C Egg Replacer as well. After some experimentation, we found we were able to make a great pizza dough that suited our diets perfectly using these packages. The other plus here is that the blend actually tastes good as well. We eat pizza at least once a week on average, and this Bob's Red Mill mix is the one we always use. In fact, with a little practice and toying with added ratios, our pizzas have reached the mouthwatering stage. So, i consider this to be a great product with an equally great value. Btw, if anybody wants the specific mix recipe we are currently using, feel free to email me by clicking on my profile and i will send you a copy. It is very simple (of course, owning a pizza stone is fairly essential as well).<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Very Happy Pizza Maker
review/text: I'm comfortable making homemade pizza crust from wheat flour so I just did the same things I always have with great success.<br /><br /> I used half the bag for one crust and it was LARGE. I used the whole yeast pack even for half the mix. I have other yeast for next time. Mix the wet and dry ,the dough should not be wet or you can't roll it out good. Instead of rising the dough in the bowl, I greased my hands with olive oil (don't use water) put the dough on a cold, oiled pizza stone, flipped the dough ball over, rolled thin with an oiled rolling pin, made an edge around then let it rest for about 15 min. I sprinkled garlic powder, oregano and basil all over the raw dough. I baked for 10 min, let it cool a little then topped (dont over sauce,it'll be soggy) and finished cooking until very crisp. It was very good but even better after reheating the next day...even more crisp. I thought it was going to over cook  but its better that way. I would buy this again. Its the first gluten free pizza I have ever had. The taste is just as good as a wheat crust! I was very happy with the pizza as were my husband and child.

review/summary: It actually rises!
review/text: I've made many gluten pizza crust recipes from scratch, using multiple (expensive) flours and all sorts of recipes. In general, they don't rise well and taste very much like cardboard. Bob's actually rises and has the texture of a foccacia flat bread.  It is NOT the wettest GF pizza crust mix I've run across ... several of the scratch ones are absolutely like batter. This is more like a loose dough. Also, I mixed it using the dough hook on my KitchenAid mixer and I'm told that may have made a big difference in the dough consistency. I followed the recipe exactly, letting it rise in a warm (garage) for 20 minutes.  It is sticky, but I followed the directions and kept wetting my hands to pat it into a round shape--be patient, wet your palms as soon as it starts to stick and go around the shape 3 or 4 times -- it will work.  You can also grease your hands with olive oil if you prefer that method.  I also did NOT use a pizza pan, but instead patted it into a round on a heavy duty lipped cookie sheet and it was perfect.  As it makes 2 crusts, I mixed a bit of dried basil and powdered garlic into the dough of one crust and that made it even better. I also patted the 2nd one quite a bit thinner, as the first time I thought it was about right, but once it rose, it was quite thick. This will be our 'go to' mix from now on.

review/summary: It's okay in a pinch.
review/text: I've been gluten free for a few years now and realize that getting decent gluten free products is not that easy. Baking them yourself seems to be the logical options, but cost and ability are great hindrances for many. I enjoy making pizza crust from scratch as I know exactly what is in it and in what quantities, and I can fudge the recipe to make a crispier or doughier pizza, depending on what I want. However, when one flour or another is out, or my starch is gone, or I'm visiting a friend or family member's house, I grab this pizza crust mix.<br />It mixes well every time without fail and tastes acceptable. Just as the other reviewers say, the crust isn't dry or crumbly, it holds together well, and makes a fair amount of pizza. It's nothing to write mom about, but it is decent, consistent pizza dough.

review/summary: A normal pizza
review/text: I bought this pizza dough from a local grocery store and it tasted so much like "normal" crust that I bought a box online.  My boyfriend is recently diagnosed gluten free and I want to cook for him.  I am a lunchlady at a private school.  I also have students and staff who are gluten challenged.  It is easy to mix and a breeze to cook.  I would recommend it

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: I haven't found a better GF mix. This is wonderful. I grew up in an Italian American family and married an Italian American too, this is the best crust we've ever tasted, GF or not. In our home we add a little sugar and honey to the mix and knead it for about 5-10 minutes which gives the dough a lovely flavor and texture. This dough also makes great soft pretzels which get gobbled right up in our home! For the money, you can't beat it. We're able to get 8 crusts out of a case and with subscribe and save its an incredible value and it works for us because we go through it so fast!

review/summary: Pizza once again!
review/text: I really do like this pizza crust mix.  I use it for more than pizza crust, I also use it to make biscuits, thicken gravy, coat chicken etc. and it always comes through with flying colors.  I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone needing to keep gluten out of their diet.  Yes, you can make your own mixes and I often do, especially for bread, but it is messy and I do not always want to have to do that.  This is a great "go-to" packaged mix from the great folks at Bob's Red Mill and here at Amazon.

review/summary: the BEST!
review/text: We've tried many gluten free pizza crust mixes. This is by far the best. When I first made it, however, I began to think this would not turn out! I was unable to roll the dough. It was kind of sticky. Keep your hands slight wet and just "work it out" on the pizza pan. Spread it out evenly, re-wetting hands when needed. It takes time but I promise you, it will be fine!!! I have the pizza pan with holes in it, and the crust turns out heavenly crisp, which we like!! The prices here on Amazon are terrific too! Fast shipping! We will continue to buy many of our gluten free staple items from Amazon!! Thank you Amazon! You guys rock!

review/summary: love it!!  Except for yeast "rise" (it doesn't??)
review/text: First off: I assure you that "I know pizza."  I'm an ex-New Yorker, and I've basically lived off of pizza my entire life.  I made pizza at home for years before I was recently diagnosed with celiac.  So I know what good pizza "should" taste like.<br /><br />I've tried the Glutino mix and a couple other mixes for pizza, and the Bob's Red Mill mix is by far the best I've tried so far.  It's easy to make, can be spread out with your hands (without using utensils), feels relatively close to regular dough, has a very good texture, and an excellent taste--almost like a gourmet pizza crust (warning: you may find the taste slightly different from what you're used to at first, since most people probably haven't tried a pizza that tastes like this; but I got used to it right away and liked it very much).<br /><br />It can be a tiny bit limp, and it's got a relatively narrow baking "window" in which to get the texture right--too undercooked and it'll be too limp and soggy, too overcooked and the browned parts of the pizza will taste kind of bitter and weird.  But I've managed to find a sweet spot, and it's fantastic.  I use the flaxseed option (no eggs), and bake for about 11 minutes on lowest rack at 450, then sauce and cheese, then back into oven at 450 for another 8 minutes.  Works great.  I HIGHLY recommend using the flaxseed option in place of the normal eggs method.<br /><br />The one thing that bugs me--I can't seem to get the dough to rise hardly at all.  It works fine anyway; but for some reason the yeast just does not seem to make the dough any bigger.  I've done the "let rest for 20 minutes" thing after mixing, and yet I can't get any action out of the yeast.  Would love to hear if others have had more luck in this regard?<br /><br />Anyway, if you're looking for a very good GF mix for pizza, look no further, this is great.  Obviously, everyone's tastes will be different--some people may try this and hate the taste or texture.  But I'd venture to say that this will be a winner for most people.  If I could've rated this 4 and a half stars, I would've--it's not absolutely perfection (5 stars), but it's better than just "very good" (4 stars).

review/summary: If your'e gluten challenged this is the one!
review/text: This product is absolutely worth purchasing if you are a gluten challenged person. Of course it's not a wheat pizza crust, but even still it's very good. It's got a nice chewy texture and making it is a snap ( I only use 1 egg). I can actually get three 12 inch shells out of the package very easily. I divide the dough into three balls and don't let it rise. I freeze two of them for later use which seems to work just fine. When I spread the dough into a shell on a baking pan, I then let it rise in the oven for a bit at low temp. Then I precook the shell so it is just starting to brown on the edges. Put the toppings on and finish cooking. For us gluten challenged folks, this is the real deal.

review/summary: I rarely complain but this tastes like Doggy Biscuits, so if you like them...
review/text: I hate giving negative reviews and sometimes people are just Fuss-buckets but I am not--so read this review knowing that I'm not big on complaining. I cook and bake A LOT. I do a lot of my own Gluten Free Recipes so I'm no novice.  I've used a Ready Made Gluten Free crust (EnerG Foods Rice Pizza Shells) here from Amazon that I pre-cooked and it's not too bad as long as you pre-cook with Olive Oil before you add the toppings and then again, after. I wanted even better--so we ordered these Bob's Red Mill Pizza Crust bags. I have made this 2x now. The first time I followed directions to the T and it turned out rubbery and gooey. The 2nd time I read EVERY review and followed the extra instructions. My Husband and I are sitting here with full bellies from this pizza--because we ate the yummy TOPPINGS, only. On an EFFORT note: It doesn't take that long--cause you let the dough rise -while you are making the chicken and onions and garlic & peppers, etc for the pizza. I even pre-seasoned the dough & forked it & oiled it and cooked it and made sure it was VERY flat. After 15 mins, I grabbed a bite of the crispy dough-before I added the toppings and it tasted like...DOG FOOD biscuits! (Now, on a side note--how could I know--you ask--well, doesn't EVERY kid taste their doggies food and you don't forget that taste) Anyway, Toppings were yummy---and I don't mind a little more effort on the crust if it taste SUPERB--but DOG FOOD PIZZA CRUST is NOT what I would recommend to ANYONE. On that note--we did feed the rest of the crust to our doggies. Bottom line--we are going back to those pre-made crusts.  The rest of the bags?  Garbage!

review/summary: Very sticky and slimy, but good flavor
review/text: I made this dough on a dry day, with the air conditioner running, and used less water than called for.  I ended up with a VERY sticky, slimy dough.  So sticky I couldn't press this dough out because it stuck horribly to my hands and wouldn't stay together.  After reading other reviews, it seems there may be some tricks for dealing with this.<br /><br />That said, the flavor was pretty good, and it did puff up in the oven more than I expected it to.  Overall, I'll probably stick to making my own dough, but I would use this in a pinch.<br /><br />If you don't want to make your own GF dough, this will work, but know you're going to get sticky.

review/text: Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Pizza Crust is really easy to make and it tastes great!<br /><br />I tried different mixes, but this one is by far the best I have come across. It doesn't have that crumbly texture and horrible bean taste that some of the other gluten free mixes have. This mix tastes just like a real, "bready" pizza crust. I haven't had pizza for a long time, and already thought I'll have to give it up forever until I tried this crust. Wow, I will probably make pizza more often again...<br /><br />Oh yes, make sure to wet your hands while working with the dough, or it will stick to your fingers like crazy (smile).

review/summary: Excellent!!!
review/text: I tried some different dough-handling techniques, to see if I could improve upon the package instructions, since it came out kind of biscuit-y:<br /><br />Instead of using wet hands to shape the dough, I sprinkled it with some white rice flour, and rolled it out between 2 rice-floured pieces of wax paper. Then I peeled off the top paper, flipped the rolled-out dough onto the pizza stone, peeled off the other piece of wax paper, then shaped the rough edges by hand. Baked it according  the instructions (7 minutes at 425), then brushed the entire crust with olive oil (helps keep the crust more soft and pliable), added the toppings and put it back in the oven to finish baking.<br /><br />The flavor and texture are as close to "real" pizza as gluten-free gets. The flavor is neutral, but if you find it too bland, just sprinkle the dough with some salt or garlic powder after you roll it out. I've tried quite a few other brands, and also tried my hand at making GF pizza dough from scratch, but this is the best I have tried; I don't even miss wheat flour crust anymore :)<br /><br />The price is economical, too; I usually divide the dough into 4 portions (to make 4 individual 10-inch crusts)and freeze them after the initial 7 minute baking. You can also make a large Sicilian pizza by rolling the dough out on a rimmed cookie sheet.

review/summary: The kids asked me to order more!
review/text: My kids and I have celiac and in addition, the kids are allergic to eggs.  The babysitter made this for them using Ener-G Egg Replacer instead of eggs or the suggested substitute, ground flaxmeal.  The kids loved it, even better than my homemade GF pizza crust I've been making for years.  I didn't get to try it warm out of the oven, but at room temperature, later.  It was a bit rubbery and tasted more like a biscuit-textured crust than a typical wheat based crust, but with toppings it made for a decent pizza.  I don't think you can even compare it to one made with wheat even though it's been about seven years since I've had one.  The kids couldn't stop raving about it though, so I'll be ordering more.

It's also easier to make than regular gluten containing mixes because it's not so doughy and you don't have to knead it. There is a trick to spreading it in the pan - you have to make sure your hands are very wet - and don't forget to prebake it before topping.

We made this pizza crust tonight (omitting the eggs and using the flaxmeal recommended on the package), with pizza sauce, Daiya mozzarella cheeze, and chicken sausage and not only did he LOVE it, but so did my husband and I, who have no food allergies and know what it *should* taste like! I just used a regular sized cookie sheet which I greased with spray olive oil, then kept a small bowl of warm water near by to dunk my hands in while I smooshed the dough into an even layer.<br />This was so easy, very tasty, and will now be a regular in our meal rotation!

review/summary: Some of the Best Pizza Dough Ever!
review/text: I like making pizza at home for several reasons, one of the main reasons being i think its better for you than some of the greasy slices you can buy and for another homemade pizza tends to taste better as well... I've always had a difficult time finding a good pizza dough recipe though, and lets face it, if the dough tastes gross, its kinda downhill from there :P at least for me it is. A friend of mine recommended this dough, she can't eat things with gluten in it. I asked her if the taste of the dough was affected by it being gluten free? she assured me it was amazing and I would not taste a difference. She was right, not only is this dough gluten free, it tastes AMAZING!! It was easy to make as well, just needed water, eggs and oil. The directions were easy to understand and follow also. Each 16oz bag i found out makes at least 6-7 nice sized pizzas (its more of a medium size) To roll it out all i did was keep my hand wet and smooth out the door, it was fast and actually fun to do! My husband loves it and I do as well, it cooks up great without any issues, and you can make a good couple pizzas- definitely great value and a good price. We went to the actual site and it was MUCH more expensive than amazon. the dough is alittle sticky, hence why you want to keep your hand wet when shaping the dough out for the pizza, you cook it about 6-7 mins before you put the ingredients on... HOWEVER if you do forget to cook it first alittle beforehand it really doesnt affect it much, my friend and I have both done this by accident a couple times but it still turned out good :P Its alot of pizza for your buck, How many pizza joints do you know that for 12 bucks you can get around 28 pizzas from? We will be buying more of this soon, Its great if you are doing a kids party and need alot of pizzas, like i said one bag usually makes for us 6 med sized pizzas. Overall i gotta give this product 5 stars!!

The package says it makes 2 12-inch pizzas or one slightly larger pizza.  The dough is sticky and you do have to pat it quite a bit to get it to spread out into two 12 inch pizzas.<br /><br />I made 6 small pizzas out of a batch and par-baked the crusts before freezing them. It's easy to thaw one out then top and bake.  I've also frozen the crusts with the topping when making a traditional tomato sauce and cheese pizza.  The plain par-baked crusts are handy for when I make non-traditional pizza.  My favorite toppings are things like goat cheese, sundried tomatoes, roasted garlic, fresh spinach, etc and they don't freeze as well.  I've not found any changes in the texture or flavor of the crust in the reheated pizza.<br /><br />GF pizza, both frozen or from a mix, are very expensive.  The Subscribe and Save deal is amazing!

review/summary: The Best!!
review/text: I've tried a few gluten free pizza crust mixes and this is my favorite. Not only is it easy to make, one package makes two good sized pizzas. One of the things I miss eating since having to omit gluten from my diet is pizza and I really enjoy this crust.

review/summary: Love Bob's Red Mill GF Pizza Crust Mix
review/text: The first time I made pizza from this mix, I used too small of a pan and the crust was really thick.  I was excited to have a thick crust pizza, but when I tasted it, I hated it.  I thought I had made a huge mistake buying this.  Then I decided to try it once more using a larger pan so that I had a very thin crust.  It was delicious!  I will definitely buy this again and again.

review/summary: Tested good
review/text: I am not allergic to gluten, I'm just a girl trying to eat healthier and I thought this tasted fine. I was afraid to try this after reading the reviews here, but it was actually pretty good, people who hated it must've cooked it wrong. It didn't rise as much as regular dough, but tasted pretty much the same. The only thing I will say, is that it suggested on the package to let it cook for 15 minutes, I found ten minutes was enough. However, we have a new oven. I also made a vegan version using Bob's Red Mill flax meal as a replacement for eggs, still delicious. Also if you have trouble rolling out the dough, it says ON THE PACKAGE, you need to push it around the pizza stone or dish with wet hands. Not exactly rocket science, people! Anyways it was yummy and  recommend it

review/summary: Best crust yet...
review/text: This crust is easy to make and tastes good.  My non-gluten free friends don't mind eating it.  I add some oregano to the mix, which seems to go over well.  I don't remember what the instructions say, but I cook it first, then turn it over and put it back in with the toppings.  It makes two crusts.  If the 2nd crust isn't eaten right away, you must use/freeze it by the next day.  It doesn't have preservatives, so will mold quickly.

review/text: When using this you should bake it for an extra 10 minutes before adding the toppings and another extra 10 minutes after the toppings.  Yes, it takes a while to bake but it is the best pizza dough i've ever had.  I personally like to double up the dough to give me one cookie sheet of extra-thick pizza.  LOVE IT!!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I really wanted to love this mix.  Our household has recently gone gluten free and previously we were making homemade pizza crust and focaccia on a regular basis.  What it really boils down to for me is taste.  This may have an acceptable texture, but the taste is terrible. I have tried it with a tomato base sauce and cheese, and because I have three mixes left...I guess I'll try something else.  Maybe a BBQ sauce pizza would drown the taste of the crust.  :-(  I don't want to throw it away but I'm thinking about it.  Really....I don't know how this got a good rating over all.  It tastes terrible.

review/text: Our first attempt came out very good, our secound attempt was fantastic.  We even had some friends come over and try the gluten free pizza, they all loved it.  The trick here seems you have to be a able to make a regular pizza first, if you know how to do that, you'll get the hang of this slightly more moist dough on the first or second try.  If you've never made pizza before, expect trouble...

review/text: There could be a better pizza crust out there, I just haven't found one yet. I have tried several very bad crust so I was thrilled to find this one. It seems to be consistent, taste good every time. I make up 4 crust at once, cook one and freeze three of them. They all taste great. I have also let the dough sit in the fridge for a day or two and we actually thought the final crust tasted better.

review/summary: Refreshing
review/text: I usually only drink sugar-free beverages; however, on a whim I decided to purchase this drink from a local convenience store.  I like the combo of tea and lemonade, but I expected that southern-style tea with pink lemonade would be extraordinarily sweet.  Fortunately, it's not.  It was surprisingly light with just the right amount of sweetness, and I could taste the pink lemonade.  It's really not too different from store bought iced tea with lemon flavor.  I think an ice cold can on a hot summer day would be perfect.<br /><br />Each can is a whopping 23-ounces; they're huge!  Of course, the calorie count is also a whopper - 270 calories with 75 grams of sugar.  I probably won't drink this one again, although if I see the sugar-free variety in my area I'll try it.  However, for fans of full-calorie beverages, I'd definitely recommend Arnold Palmer's Southern Style Sweet Tea with Pink Lemonade for a nice change of pace.  I marked it down a star because of the cost - the price of one can at the store was less than half the per-unit cost for this case.

review/summary: The Trans Fat Lie
review/text: If you needed any more proof that the government is not here to protect you (and it shouldn't be), listen up.<br /><br />This product claims: "Zero grams of trans fat per serving" which is code for; "We adapted our nutritional information and serving size data to utilize the government approved lie to deceive you, the consumer."<br /><br />The second ingredient in this product is partially hydrogenated oil.  Which, by absolute definition is TRANS FAT.<br /><br />I strongly suggest everyone educate themselves on how this modified fatty acid is destroying your health, and the food companies know it.  It's specifically designed to prevent oil from turning rancid, by preventing oxidation of the fatty acid.<br /><br />In my opinion, the hydrogenation of oil will result in law suits that overshadow the tobacco industry suits.<br /><br />In the meantime, I'll look for a better alternative for this product.

review/text: This was my first experience with chutney, and I can only hope the rest I try are as good as this one. I was told that a large chain organic grocer (TFM) that makes a pork and brie sandwich used this mango chutney. I wish I could get the bulk container that they do, but I guess I'll just have to use is sparingly.<br /><br />I would recommend trying the pork and brie sandwich from the fresh market. The other items on that sandwich (including thin apple slices) seem to go especially well with this sauce. I may not have liked this chutney had I just put it on any sandwich I would make for myself at home. It helps to try a better example.

review/text: I usually buy jerky in large bags that I find at Costco. Well, I ran out so I picked up a 3.25-ounce bag of Jack link's Original Beef Jerky (mesquite smoked) at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. The jerky was excellent! Wonderful flavor! Thin sliced and dry. This is real good jerky! So, I went to report this on my Amazon reviews. You know, they had all kinds of Jack Link's Jerky (I'm amazed) but they didn't have a listing for 3.5-ounce bags of this particular kind. All right, I'll put my report here. It's the same product, just a different-sized bag. This is really good jerky. The more you can get, the better.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Kellogg's  cereals contains genetically modified organisms which have been patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides. GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide and is one of the ingredients in Kellogg's products. They are also made to be resistant to high levels of a chemical called glyphosate, an herbicide, which is linked to birth defects, cancer, organ damage and inflammatory bowel disease. It also has insecticidal properties and kills off beneficial gut flora. These GMOs have not been subjected to independent, long term, peer reviewed studies to prove that they are safe. These GMOs make my family sick. We do not pour pesticides on our food and we no longer eat anything that is an EPA registered pesticide.  GMOs are linked to organ damage, faulty insulin regulation and obesity, autoimmune disease, autism and a whole host of other health and environmental problems. Kellogg has contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California which is spreading lies to convince people that they should vote again GMO Labeling (prop. 37) in California on Nov. 6th because they don't want you to know that their products contain GMO corn, sugar, soy and canola.

Another options is have them order three boxes at once and throw the set in for free - that would be my choice!

review/text: I have purchased this assortment at a warehouse club, but Amazon dropped the price to the point where it was better to get it online than in a store. Came well-packed and fresh. The box contains three separate bags of cereal.<br /><br />My only complaint (and this is for the warehouse version as well as the one from Amazon) is that Apple Jacks don't taste the way I remember them when I was a kid (we're talking decades ago). I recall the taste being spicy with a bit of a "bite" to it. It still tastes good, but it seems rather bland compared with my "taste memory." Wonder if they changed it, or if my recollection is fogged by the passage of time.<br /><br />In any case, a great assortment at a very good price.

review/text: It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!

review/summary: Peanut Butter Cookies
review/text: I enjoy them a lot and so does my son. I have to say that this kind is one of my favorites. It is full of peanut butter flavor that you forget that it is only 100 cals. As for the amount you get in the bag, it is more than I expecting so I was very happy.

review/summary: The portable and edible Oreo
review/text: One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!  SMILES

review/summary: Flavor in, Calories Down, Fat Nearly Out
review/text: As I get older and fatter, I seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy.  Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.<br /><br />Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.<br /><br />You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.<br /><br />Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.<br /><br />Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Now we have the Oreo transformed into a baked chocolate wafer snack
review/text: We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the "Oreo Biscuit").  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the "modern" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for "hill"), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the "cream" in between.<br /><br />Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br /><br />But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br />These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: "Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.

review/summary: not as good as the 100-calorie Oreos
review/text: With any low fat or low calorie food, you're going to sacrifice taste of portion size.  With this product, you sacrifice both.<br /><br />It's a good idea, which was done well with the Oreos and others in this series of "100 calorie" snacks, but I think you're better off with a single cookie from the regular Chips Ahoy box than a whole bag of these.

review/summary: THESE ARE TRUE 'MAINSTREAM' DIET SNACKS --
review/text: FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES<br /><br />When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, "100 calorie packs" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + "ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS" & "ARTIFICIAL COLORS" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history.

review/summary: Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?
review/text: I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of "A Star Is Born" the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are "100 Calorie Packs", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.

The texture is perfection. If you feel like chewing them quickly or take it slowly and let the light wafer melt in your mouth.

review/summary: They're not bad
review/text: Let me begin by saying that I do not like Oreo cookies at all. I think the cookie part is bitter and I hate the white cream filling. When a friend suggested I try these I was reluctant and kept telling her that I was not interested. She insisted so I tried a few and surprisingly did not find them to be bad at all. I'm diabetic, so this is not a snack I will be eating often, but a few here and there won't hurt. If you're expecting these to taste like Oreo cookies (I'm one who's glad they didn't!!), then you'll be disappointed. But if you want a chocolate snack that's low in calories and fat please give these a try.

review/text: Growing up on Oreos and milk is common. So I was taken aback with the brand extension of Oreo's to cakesters. And while I had low expectations, I must say these are better than normal Oreos. Although I can't say it'll beat the combo of oreos and milk, these are fantastic treats and relatively guilt-free.  If you like cake and like Oreos you can't go wrong with Oreo cakesters.<br /><br />The filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new Oreo experience. Certainly worth a try - guaranteed enjoyment!
