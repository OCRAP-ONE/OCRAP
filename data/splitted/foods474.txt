review/text: This is coffee in a pod, so one can not compare it with fresh-ground coffee.  However, for a pod it is very tasty.  Sustainability is just as important as convenience, so this Wolfgang Puck fair-trade organic pod is a great option.

review/summary: They're too big
review/text: Yes, it's quality coffee, but the pods are too large for my Senseo machine.  It makes it hard to close, so I have to use the two-cup holder for a single pod to make a seal.  This causes the coffee to be weak, and I do only brew one cup at a time.  I'd be interested in hearing if anyone else had this problem.

review/text: Bought these beans for our SAECO Odea Go.  Much better than the Starbuck's we had been using since we first got it.  Found out that feeding a superautomatic burnt beans like Starbuck's espresso can cause problems for our machine.  This coffee has a far better taste, and enough kick to boot.  Makes a nice cappuccino or espresso, good crema.  Cheaper than other Lavazza beans on Amazon too.  Hopefully they don't raise the price.

review/summary: Excellent quality, a bit light for espresso?
review/text: This is the lightest roast I've encountered that calls itself "espresso roast." The quality, however, is so much better than what I've been drinking that my wife and I are torn on the issue of purchasing more. On the one hand, we'd like a darker roast. On the other, the quality of this coffee is so much better than what we've been making espresso from that we aren't sure we want to change coffees. I think we'll probably search for a darker roast that has the quality of this Lavazza, but, if we don't find it we'd be likely to come back to this quality rather than drink a darker roast of lesser quality. Excellent coffee.

review/text: Cotechino is a staple on italian dinner tables, especially on or around New Year's Day when it's traditionally served with lentils. Parmacotto is a popular brand in Italy and the cotechino did not disappoint, but the price ($25.00 plus $7.99) was ridiculously high -- the typical cotechino sold in Italy is usually at least twice as big as this one.<br /><br />As cotechino seems to be very hard to find in the US outside of a few metro areas with big italian communities (NY or SF), this may be your only option to try it but be aware that you'll be paying a lot of dough for a pretty small sausage.

I give my 10 month old 1/4c of it when he seems constipated.  My pediatrician agreed it was a good idea.  Do your research.  I was sorry to see that the 34 oz boxes were not available on the "Prime" shipping program.  Now I order 11 oz boxes on autoship.

review/summary: Great Pedialyte or Gatorade Substitute!
review/text: A nutritionist recommended coconut water to me when I was looking for a natural substitute to Pedialyte when our baby has a stomach bug.  I was told that the components in coconut water are the most similar to the water in the human body that needs to be replaced due to dehydration.  No artificial colors or flavors, and no high fructose corn syrup like Gatorade or Pedialyte! We purchased some coconut water at our local health food store for an arm and a leg for that illness episode- now I buy Vita Coco or Zico in bulk on Amazon to have on hand for our whole family- a much better deal!

review/text: This makes excellent iced tea! The tea has a very good lemon flavor, think more like a lemon oil or lemon extract type of flavor, you will still need to add lemon juice if you like your iced tea to be a bit on the sour side. I make it in 1 quart batches, boiling water for 5 minutes, 4 packets of equal and a splash of lemon juice, then I steep the leaves again for a 2nd brewing using the same amount of equal as the first. I usually buy my teas in small sample sizes because I love trying different kinds but this will be a permanent selection in my cabinet, as it makes the best iced tea I have ever had.

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill is the BEST! But NutriCity is WORST source!
review/text: Even better than Quaker or Mother's, these Bob's Red Mill Oats are the very best! They are thicker cut and you get 4 bags, but with the shipping from NutriCity this price is a Rip Off. If ordered directly from Bob's (as of this date) a four pack is $17.57 including shipping, and you get really FRESH oats from a trustworthy source - right from the mill!  Order TWO cases and save even more! Then throw them in the freezer for as long as you need, over a year is fine, and pull out fresh, tasty oats every time. (Bobsredmill site) We use oats every day so we order a LOT.<br />Did you know that the grain we call "oats" is really the SEED of the oat plant? No wonder its so nutritious! After the inedible HULL is removed, the "groat" remains and is milled into all kinds of oats (steel cut or "Irish Oats," old fashioned rolled oats, quick oats, instant oatmeal, etc.) The great thing is that ALL the nutrition, fiber, and food value REMAINS no matter what STYLE of oats you choose!! Also, ground up oats can be substituted for up to one third of the FLOUR called for in baking recipies, so you can sneak in extra nutrition without anyone being able to tell the difference. Just put the oats, and an equal amount of the flour called for in the recipe, into a food processor and process till nearly smooth. Works great!<br />Rolled oats is 50% soluble fiber and 50% insoluble fiber, having 8 grams of fiber per dry (uncooked) CUP! The soluble fiber floats around in your blood, reducing bad cholesterol and generally cleaning up, while the unsoluble fiber aids digestion and regularity. You just can't get a better buy in grains than OATS  - but dont use Nutricity!

review/summary: Makes the BEST iced tea.
review/text: Being from the Southern US, I've been drinking iced tea since I was a child. We've always used, I might say with satisfaction, Lipton or Luzianne brands until my wife brought this brand home from the store. The blend of teas used is fragrant and rich. The end product is very clear, but very dark and has a long finish with no bitterness or strong after-taste.<br /><br />I use the instructions on the side of the box (2 bags to 4 cups of almost boiling water and steep for 4 minutes) except I don't dilute it with equal parts of fresh water. Instead, I pack a tall glass (not plastic) to the brim with ice, spoon in the desired amount of sugar or sweetener (I use Splenda Blend) and then pour the hot tea over the ice. Stir briskly and enjoy. It tends to dilute itself almost perfectly for me.<br /><br />I now purchase it here on Amazon, and since I'm a Prime Member, and get free shipping, it comes out to be more economical than buying it in smaller amounts in the local grocer.

review/summary: A Must Have for the Foodies Spice Cabinet
review/text: When I first received my order of the Italian Dressing mix, I was a little wary. A lot of prepared herb and spice mixes on the market seem to be full chemicals that I can't pronounce and they taste very dull, extremely salty and have a strange, artificial after-taste. NOT THIS ONE!<br /><br />When my order arrived the first thing that I did was to taste the mixture straight out of the jar. I was surprised at how clean and fresh the taste was. I picked up on the herbs (I'm thinking oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary and maybe some mint), the sea salt and then the sweetness of the bell pepper combined with a tartness of the lemon juice. There was a slight bit of heat (the garlic?) and a nice, pure, food-like aftertaste.<br /><br />Next I mixed it with some fine olive oil and used it as a dip for some crusty Italian bread. Wonderful! Later in the week I used it, along with some Dijon Mustard, as a coating for a rack of lamb. I ended up adding a little crushed black pepper to the mix and it was great.<br /><br />Finally I used it as a salad dressing along with aged balsamic vinegar, wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. It took a few minutes to get the proportions right, and I did add a little chopped rosemary and some fresh minced garlic. It was much better than any prepared dressing that comes in a bottle.<br /><br />I was really impressed with the flavor and quality of this prepared mix, so much so that I ordered this variety pack.  Here are my thoughts on the other two varieties that come with this set:<br /><br />*  French Garden<br />At first taste it seemed salter than the Italian version.  The chives not only tasted fresh but still retained their classic oval shape (meaning that they were not over-processed or ground to death).  The garlic and onions were strong, but not too.  I also picked up on the parsley and I thought I tasted a little tarragon.  I added this mix to a French style omelet (runny).  Very nice!  My fear of it being too salty was put to rest.  I next sprinkled it on some grilled eggplant and I was blown away!  It woke up the subtle flavors of the vegetable.  I will be trying this is other dishes to be sure.<br /><br />*  Napa Garden<br />This mix had a different texture than the others, probably due to the tomato powder which added a wonderful richness to the blend.  This one was not as salty as the other two.  The pepper gave it a little heat but I usually like more (which is easy to add, hard to take out). I tried this (along with some olive oil) with spinach angel-hair pasta.  That turn out to be a good choice.  The mix did not overwhelm the flavor of the pasta but added that extra kick.<br /><br />I highly recommend this variety pack.  All three will become staples in my spice cabinet.

review/text: I have been on a diet for a while now, only eating oil and vinegar on my salads. I ordered this product thinking it would at least improve the taste a little. Well, now everyone in my family is hooked on this stuff. Even my picky husband loves it. My daughter loves to mix with olive oil and dip bread in it. All of the flavors are absolutely wonderful. You've got to give them a try.

review/summary: Delicious and Gluten Free Too!
review/text: I have been looking for a long time for a decent salad dressing. The store-bought dressings haven't done the trick (unhealthy oils, mysteriously long-named ingredients, odd to no taste, etc), the mixes we've tried haven't been much better, and I have yet to find a really terrific homemade dressing that is similar to what I can get in my favorite Italian restaurant. So, I was a bit leery when I saw these. But the price was right and so with a "sure can't hurt" attitude, we bought the Italian mix.<br /><br />Oh my! It is very tasty with just the right blend of spices and "zing" (not a hot and spicy zing, just an "awaken the tastebuds" zing). We all loved it and so were inspired to try the other varieties. There is no disappointment here! All 3 are simply delicious and have me wishing that, like a cow, I had more stomachs so I could eat more of the stuff ;o)  I find myself craving salads at all sorts of times and it makes a yummy marinade also.<br /><br />Seeing how our family recently found we need to go gluten-free, I contacted the company to ask about their GF status. The reply was that though the bottles are not yet labeled as such (they soon will be) they are most certainly gluten-free. So, one more thing we restricted diet people can have to enjoy. YAY!!<br /><br />It's great to be able to make up our dressings with the healthy oils we enjoy and to be able to understand every ingredient on the label. Our family appreciates that. Along with it being economical, I'd say you can't go wrong. Try them out. And if you don't like them, well, you can give them to me ;o)<br /><br />Bon Appetit!

review/text: I had read about this on a web site for HCG because it's so hard to find ingredients for a salad dressing w/o sugars added. My husband usually uses packaged dry mix and really liked it instead of his regular mix so I can use it with or w/o oil and it tastes great!

I'm enjoying my salads so much more with this.  Also delightful as a dry rub on meats.  Very favorable.  So glad I found out about them!<br /><br />This is a sugar and gluten free product.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I really wanted to like these dressings/marinades/rubs, but had to give upon them before I wasted a couple hundred in other ingredients trying to salvage the experiment.  Maybe they're good as rubs or marinades?  I made the various dressing mixes listed on the side of the bottles, but I didn't have the heart to put them on meat.<br /><br />I had two big problems:<br />1) All of the dressing recipes are super, super, super vinegary.  Even if you cut back on the vinegar, you're still left with super, super vinegary.  If you're from South Carolina, this might be your thing.  I'm not, it isn't.<br />2) They all smell and taste similar!  You know how every variety of Sam Adams tastes like, well... Sam Adams?  These mixes have the same issue.  If I had to guess, I'd say that "herb blend" that's the first ingredient on each bottle is the same blend - something proprietary that the makers spin off in different directions to make the different dressings.<br /><br />They are relatively healthy, without any scary fillers or sugar or whatnot, but Annie's, Wegman's and Brianna's make whole lines of relatively healthy dressings that actually taste good.  I'll be going back to those, or making my own herb mixes.

review/summary: You may not be used to the taste of real Ginger Ale
review/text: Remember when they gave you Ginger Ale when you had stomach problems. I bought a bottle the other day and put it in the fridge. A friend came over and said she felt sick, I gave her a swallow and she felt better right away. I took a swig and it settled my stomach too.<br /><br />I hesitate to write this to make it sound like this stuff is just medicine or medicine tasting.  It taste great with a real refreshing shock of ginger flavor you just don't taste from the mainstream Ginger Ales anymore. The Honey Lime is an original and wonderful addition, I not only plan to buy more to eat with my next meal, I also plan to save some for when I feel a little upset.<br /><br />I think the Honey Lime Ginger Ale flavorings  will also help with a cold or a sore throat. It all taste real to me!

review/text: This is standard against which I compare all other green teas. Now if you like your breakfast green tea strong, this is not for you. This is quite light on the "green" flavor. I like the strong green tea flavor also, but for breakfast this is fine!<br /><br />I have this straight, with honey, or with honey and lemon. It is a perfect match with lemon and honey. I never liked honey in green tea until I tried it with this! When I want my vitamin C, I squeeze an entire lemon into this brew! It takes a little more honey, but tastes wonderful.

review/summary: Awesome flavored green tea
review/text: Due to the recent 30% off special for select Lipton tea here on Amazon, I have been stocking up like crazy. The Lipton Green Tea Orange Passionfruit & Jasmine is in my opinion one of the better tasting flavors from Lipton's green tea lineup. The flavor is strong but not overpowering which is good because I don't want to feel like I'm drinking a fruit juice. I am a little disappointed in the actual green tea taste because there really isn't that much to begin with. However, to counter that, I do drink green tea for health benefits and not for its taste! This tea, like most of the Liptons I buy, I always drink cold. I do like to drink a hot cup or so whenever I can after a greasy meal but cold tea is much better in my opinion.<br /><br />Also, this tea is very similar to the pyramid bag shaped Mandarin Orange green tea from Lipton as well.

review/summary: Mild tasting green tea
review/text: To me, most green tea has a very strong, raw taste . . . like drinking liquid grass. But, this green tea with orange, passionfruit, and jasmine is very mild and pleasant. I prefer mine with just a little sweetener, such as honey. I'm also a coffee drinker, but when I'm feeling a bit out of sync, this green tea has a soothing, settling effect. I keep a few tea bags in my purse because I find restaurant coffee usually dissatisfying. Rather than paying $2.00 for a cup of something that I don't even enjoy, I just ask for a cup or small pot of hot or boiling water, and pluck my own tea bag in! My meal is so much more enjoyable . . . plus I save the cost of a bad tasting cup of coffee!

review/summary: refreshing tea with a delicate flavor....
review/text: I love to drink green tea after my first cup of coffee, when I want something warm but without a lot of caffeine, in addition green tea is supposed to be good for you and increase your metabolism.  I don't know if that is proven, but it couldn't hurt, right?  I have not bought flavored lipton tea before, and was surprised that they had a whole line of green teas.  This one so far is my favorite one.  It has a delicate flavor from orange, passionfruit and jasmine.  Though I normally drink this with no sweetener with honey would be lovely.  I have also used it to make iced tea, but since it brews light, I would probably add in a couple of regular lipton bags to get a darker brew and a more balanced taste for ice tea.<br /><br />Overall, a really nice tea for everyday.  Relaxing and tastes as good as it smells!

It smells great and tastes great.<br /><br />People who complain about the tea bag separating from the string are correct: the packaging quality is very poor, and surprising given how many decades Lipton has been making tea bags.<br /><br />The way to avoid the problem is to hold the tea bag with index finger and thumb at the point where the the tag is affixed, then gently pull the tag from the bag.  Next, when dunking the tea bag in the water, pull up on the tag gently, otherwise it will come off.  Better yet, don't dunk the bag at all. Just let it steep by itself for a couple of minutes and then remove it. Enjoy. Rinse and repeat.

review/summary: Tastes good, contains glue
review/text: I have been drinking this tea daily for years, and plan to continue. The orange and other flavors nicely mask the plain green-tea flavor, which otherwise tastes like river-water.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the strings are glued to the tea bags. Yes, I know that's hard to believe - the glue melts almost immediately upon contact with the hot water. You might be able to dunk the tea bag four or five times before it falls off, splashing hot tea onto the tablecloth.<br /><br />One can imagine the glee with which the Lipton executives toss actual pennies into the air, as they watch the laid-off staple plant workers shuffle off. One thing they are certainly not doing is drinking this tea.<br /><br />The packaging does not indicate what animal the glue is from, nor its nutritional value. Horses, cattle?

review/summary: Nice tea, poorly packaged- tea bags open at the top and let leaves out
review/text: nice light tasting green tea.  Enjoyed it as part of a variety pack bought at my grocery store so ordered the same tea in bulk here.  However, the packaging of tea shipped by Amazon is inadequate and makes this tea nearly unusuable.  Each tea bag opens at the top when the tag/label string is pulled apart from the bag just before using the tea bag. The adhesive holding the top of the tea bags together is not strong enough to withstand even tiny, gentle pull from trying to "unstick" the tag and string from the bag.  Other than that the packaging is normal Lipton packaging (white paper outer envelope for each bag, thin cardboard box.  But this one defect is enough to make the tea unusuable (unless you like sifting it through your teeth as you drink) without resorting to self help such as personally stapling each tea bag closed after loosing the tag.  While the tea itself is ok and a nice light green tea for those who don't like the really strong kind, this is too much annoyance, I tossed these and will not reorder this brand of tea online, especially in bulk.  I am a lifelong tea drinker and have not experienced this problem with any other teas with anywhere near such frequency as I have with each box in this 6-pack of boxes of Lipton Green Tea.  The similar tea I purchased in a store had no problems.

review/summary: Swashbuckling Adventures in the Lesser Antilles!
review/text: Green Tea, Orange, Passionfruit and Jasmine.  An excellent combination.  Reminds me of this one time..<br /><br />Twas the Summer of 1933, Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford had requisitioned the H.M.S. Peregrine Caverdish for Privateering in the Lesser Antilles under a Letter of Marque and Reprisal ordered by King George V.  We had pushed through the Windward Islands, with a quick stop in Barbados to resupply.<br /><br />Again, our journey was filled with devious treachery.  Once the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish sailed from the protection of the Leeward Islands, controlled of course by His Majesty's Royal Navy (the finest Navy on all the high seas!), the waters of the Lesser Antilles were patrolled by a cacophony of Spanish Armada's and Dutch Privateers.  Just two weeks prior we had commandeered the Dutch ship Eendracht, and it's Captain, Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp, under legally sanctioned duress (we Englishman always operate within the law), told of a Dutch fort with an "embarrassment of riches" on the Dutch island of La Tortuga.  Long known for it's rich salt deposits, First Mate Tignor, a fine military tactician, drew up a brilliant assault plan upon the La Tortuga.<br /><br />We approached through the dense tropical jungle, with First Mate Tignor on point.  We made sure our muskets were loaded, for the assault had a high probability of bloodshed.  But prepared we all were.  "I never liked em Dutchies, a bunch of nancies them be", bellowed Midshipman Householder.  "Let me at em, Skipper, and I swear I'll make the King Proud."  We tipped further until they reached the base of the outer wall of the Dutch fort.  We threw our grappling hooks over the outer wall, and prepared for our siege.<br /><br />As soon as they descended the wall, they heard the distinct screams, of.... a damsel!<br /><br />"With your authority skipper, I call onesies on the damsel", First Mate Tignor asked.<br /><br />"You have my authority First Mate Tignor, you will rescue her and meet us back here in thirty-six minutes", I responded.<br /><br />"For England", called First Mate Tignor.<br /><br />"For the King", I answered.<br /><br />And with that, First Mate Tignor took off.<br /><br />As he followed the sullen screams of the fair maiden's call, First Mate Tignor found his pathway blocked by six unsavory Dutch buccaneers.<br /><br />"A filthy Englishman", gruffed the tall one, "we ought to slit his throat right here".<br /><br />Their leader, a unshaven, slightly portly fellow spoke next.  "My name is Lord Petr Laars Oxidant, of Rotterdam.  I'm the ranking officer of this outpost, and you have just unfairly angered me.  I'll gladly draw swords with an Englishman as filthy as you".  And with that, Captain Petr Laars Oxidant unsheathed his cutlass.<br /><br />First Mate Tignor was faster on the draw, as his cutlass, forged by pure Japanese steel, a gift from the Samurai King of Eto, flew out from his side and plunged deep within the chest of the gruff, tall Dutchman.  With the speed and precision of a bolt of lightning, First Mate Tignor dispatched three more of the Dutch.  One of the remaining Dutchman fled terrified, as all are well aware of the fear and cowardice of the Dutch.  All that stood between First Mate Tignor and the fair maiden was Lord Petr Laars Oxidant.<br /><br />"It is a good day to die", exclaimed First Mate Tignor, as he volleyed a thrust of Lord Oxidant's cutlass.  Swish.  Miss.  Clink.  Blocked.  Whirrrrr.  Lord Oxidant's cutlass just barely missed First Mate Tignor's ear.<br /><br />"You have skill, Englishman", Lord Oxidant growled, "but you still have much to learn.  You see, the Dutch are a proud nation, built upon the pillars of faith, country, honor, freedom and..."<br /><br />Before Lord Oxidant could finish his speech, First Mate Tignor thrust the cutlass deep through Lord Oxidant's callous heart.  At the very moment, a lost and confused Boson's Mate Micklegal stumbled upon the swashbuckling duo a half seconds time before the fatal blow.  Boson's Mate Micklegal knelt down next to Lord Oxidant's lifeless body and retrieved a pouch of green tea leaves from his coat.  "From henceforth", Boson's Mate Micklegal decreed, "let this tea be known as "Anti-Oxidant Green Tea".  Oh that clever Boson's Mate Micklegal.<br /><br />Boson's Mate Micklegal followed First Mate Tignor to the rear wall, and helped as First Mate Tignor cut the restraints above the fair maiden's hands.<br /><br />"My hero", the fair maiden cried, "I owe you my life kind sir, for I am Lady Jasmine, of Port Royal, daughter of Lord Sydney Olivier, Governor of Jamaica."<br /><br />"Well my lady", First Mate Tignor said as he tipped his hat and kneeled, "First Mate Tignor, of Portsmouth, England, at your service".  First Mate Tignor thrust his arms around Lady Jasmine and tossed her over his shoulder as she giggled. "Welcome to the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish, my lady", he chuckled, a wink in his eye.<br /><br />The crew rejoiced upon the deck of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish.  The treasure at the Dutch Fort, or, that that remained of the treasure were a barrel of oranges, a few spices, and an odd fruit unfamiliar to us.  Boson's Mate Micklegal, his trusty kettle in hand, decided tea would be most proper.  He placed the Anti Oxidant green tea leaves into the kettle, and added the zest of the orange.  But Boson's Mate Micklegal believed the tea was missing something.  He placed the spice and the essence of the strange fruit into the kettle as well.<br /><br />"What do you call this type of tea Boson's Mate Micklegal?", I asked, "It surely cannot be Earl Grey".  (As all fine Englishman know, that Earl Grey Tea, "The Earl", is the finest tea in His Majesty's empire, truly the tea of Kings.)<br /><br />Boson's Mate Micklegal glanced over at First Mate Tignor and Lady Jasmine.  "Well Captain, the fruit is called 'The Fruit of Passion', in honor of that", pointing at First Mate Tignor and Lady Jasmine.  "And the spice, well, that's Jasmine Spice Captain."  I gave Boson's Mate Micklegal a courteous smile.<br /><br />That night, in a sleepwalk, Boson's Mate Micklegal found a bottle of fine Glen Fiddych, stowed away in the hold, consumed it, and then set the oranges, fruit of passion, and Jasmine spice ablaze on the aft deck so that he could toast his baguette.  Oh well, such is life in the Lesser Antilles.<br /><br />I had forgotten of this deep and fruit infused tea for many years, until a fellow of mine brewed me a fine cup of Green Tea with Orange, Passionfruit and Jasmine made by the hacks at Lipton, that was spot on.  A lovely memory!

review/summary: Does not taste good
review/text: It's great if you're looking for a tea with antioxidants (found naturally in most teas) but if you're looking for a palatable fruit based one, don't buy this one. It's cheap, granted, but I was expecting actual passion fruit and orange flavors as advertised. Instead the tea tastes more like plastic when you  heat it (er think tupperware when it's been microwaved too many times). Perhaps similar to the orange juice left on the radiator? Anyway, not recommended.

Our children drink Rooibos instead of soda, its great for invalids, the elderly, insomnia, tension, add a slice of lemon and some honey and its a cold remedy.  If you HAVE to drink iced tea, make it rooibos!<br /><br />Buchu is a tried and trusted home remedy.  It also works very well as a soothing poultice on a sprained joint.

You can also apply it to your face with an inexpensive, fan-shaped, craft paintbrush.  Honey has anti-bacteria properties, and, after using on your face, you'll have wonderful, smooth skin.  It may even help with acne.<br /><br />With Amazon Prime, this is an unbeatable price.

review/summary: Works Great!
review/text: Due to a problem with child care I have to work early so I can leave work at 2:15 and pick up my son from school, this means I have to get up at 4:30AM so by Wednesday I am really dragging.<br /><br />I had seen 5 hour energy being advertised for a long time but had written it off as being a fraud without even trying it.  One day I was really dragging and felt like I was going to fall asleep<br /><br />at the wheel while driving to pickup my son so I pulled into a Walgreens to see if there was something I could buy to wake me up.  I quit drinking soda's a long time ago and cannot stand the<br /><br />taste of coffee so I decided to purchase a 2 pack of 5 hour energy to see if maybe it did work and I was wrong all this time.<br /><br />To my surprise it actually did make me feel peppy!  I now purchase them in packs of 12 and take one at 2:00 Monday - Friday, I find this gives me just enough of a boost to make it to 9:00 without<br /><br />falling asleep.  When I pick my son up I take him the gym and the '5 hour boost' has really helped my workout.<br /><br />I haven't seen any negative side effects and I have been taking 1 per day, Monday - Friday for 2 months.<br /><br />If you add the shipping and handling fee, Walmart has the same price as Amazon.

review/summary: Best natural energy boost I've ever taken
review/text: Although this product does have an abundance of vitamin b12, which can be bad for the liver over a long period of using it, it is an AMAZING energy and moood booster.  I use it pre workout when I goto the gym a lot, and it is unreal how fast it will kick in.  I've used other's pre-workout shakes and such, but this is the easiest and quickest way to get that boost.  I've also noticed a big difference in my focus.  I can concentrate on my back muscles a lot better when doing lat pulldowns and things when taking this as oppose to not.  Def would recommend this, and use the subrscibe and save.  No other price on the net touches it.  I've been getting mine shipped for $19.83 for the past few months.  Thats less than $2.00 a bottle where my gas station by my house sells them for $3.99.

review/summary: Skeptic, converted
review/text: I saw the commercials over the years and said "yeah, right".  But somewhere along the way, i decided to give it a try.  Like an earlier reviewer, i cant stand coffee.  So i tried it and was amazed how effective it was.  Of course the primary ingredient is caffeine and i had never used caffeine products as a performance aid.  A cup of coffee is much cheaper, but if you cant tolerate coffee, then this is the way to go, even if you have to pay quite a bit more.  I make it a point not to use it daily, but just when needed, so i dont build up a tolerance for the caffeine.<br /><br />Having said that, i raved about 5-h-e to a friend of mine.  He said he had tried it and was disappointed.  After further discussion, it came out that he was a big coffee drinker.  So if you already drink high caffeine products such as coffee, you probably wont get as much of a positive effect, if any.  For everyone else though, highly recommended.

With something with such a high levels of vitamins you have to be careful as an overdose of vitamins can make you feel quite unwell and even be dangerous. You certainly should stick to the reccommended doses.<br />I found it did give me a bit of an energy boost, but I felt it didnt give me the long term boost in energy that I was hoping for, plus I didnt really like the taste all that much.<br />Since I prefer all natural supplements I thought I would give a all natural supplement called Gene Eden. It gives me the long term boost of energy that I was hoping for and with it being an antiviral supplement it helps me recover from colds and viruses much quicker.<br />If you interested it is also available on amazon Gene-Eden: Antiviral Natural Remedy for Latent HPV, EBV, Herpes, Hepatitis, Safe, Effective, Patented Formula

review/text: I can honestly say that these shots are sometimes crutches for me when I feel like I'm about to just pass out. I'm majoring in Mechanical Engineering and these things are PHENOMENAL for when you need to get some late night studying done, or if you need some energy to focus on exams. It takes about ~20 minutes for me to feel the effects, and it lasts for 3-4 hours for me. I feel only slightly jittery, but there's a significant difference in the amount of focus you get from a 5 hour energy than your regular energy drink. I suppose the B vitamins are to thank for that! And of course, the best part... NO CRASH! I highly recommend these if you are a college student. They are VERY beneficial and will give you that extra boost and focus you need!

review/summary: 5-Hour Energy Saves the Day
review/text: 5-Hour Energy is probably one of the best energy drinks out there, and the effectiveness is simply amazing. I'm an vegetarian high school student taking 4 AP courses. Sometimes, I get so loaded with work that I have to go to bed at two or three in the morning and still wake up at seven. Before I used 5-Hour Energy, I'd sometimes doze off or fall asleep in my classes. However, after I used 5-Hour Energy, my life changed. Now, with only 1 ounce of 5-Hour Energy, I can power through the school day and swim practice easily without feeling tired at all. My grades rose significantly, and I can actually pay attention in class. Just yesterday, I managed to power through the day with only 2 hours of sleep and 1 ounce of 5-Hour Energy. The extra energy that the product gives you is definitely worth the money. The product is simply amazing.

I think that it's best served chilled or diluted with ice.  I bought this at a gas station during a lunch break and had it room temp. NOT RECOMMENDED in my opinion of course. To each their own.<br /><br />Despite the taste, I believe this product really works.  I'm not jittery or shaky as described in the product info and so far the only negative effect has been a very slight light-headed feeling.  I also notice that alot of tension keeps returning to my shoulders but that could be just me.  Overall, I highly recommend this product a try for anybody not overly sensitive to caffeine.

review/text: I have used many types of energy drinks/pills over the years. This product actually works, but in reality you do not really know what is in there. One of their ingredients is "Proprietary Blend". It doesn't get vaguer than that. However, if you're looking for sustained energy it does do the job. Do you get exactly 5 hours of energy, probably not? Do you get a little jittery, yes sometimes? Everybody is different so results will probably be different than mine.

review/text: My job demands a lot of energy and attention to detail.  I find this to work very well for me when I am feeling physically and/or mentally tired. Some people, like my husband, may not respond to this stuff so try a bottle from the store first.  I don't think the taste is so bad.  I have te berry kind and it just tastes like a sugary drink to me.  It does have a bit of a "kick" to it, that is the B vitamin. I can't swallow pills, so I have had to chew my vitamins which sometimes have a bitter or tangy taste.  I would recommend this to a friend to try.  I get no crash from it, no "withdraw" either.  Some energy drink will give me a spell of extrem sleepyness if I have been drinking them for a while and stop, I don't get that with this stuff.

review/text: I had to pull an all-nighter but I hate the huge cans of energy drinks (sometimes they make me go to sleep). I saw the commercial for this product on tv and decided to try it out. The berry flavor's not too bad-it tastes like liquified smarties. I also liked the fact that it promises that you won't crash (I had several classes and work the following day) and that it's only 4 calories. The no-refrigeration is also handy when you only want to drink half of the bottle.<br /><br />I drank a whole bottle after deciding that half wouldn't give me enough juice to stay up. I did start feeling it after a couple of minutes and I actually lasted for about 8 more hours before I started feeling drowsy. There was no crash and I didn't feel any bad effects. I definitely recommend this to anyone and plan on using it again.

review/summary: Great when you start feeling tired.
review/text: I love to play golf and before I start I usually hit a bucket of balls. I started noticing that my game was going down by the 12th or 13th hole. My friend was always telling me how good he felt when he used 5 HOUR so I decided to try it. Wow, I have the energy to play an entire round and no jitters. I now always carry one in my golf bag and I feel it's helping my golf game because it helps me stay in focus and not feel tired. =^..^=

review/summary: Five hour energy - expensive, but seems to work.
review/text: I'm a big health proponent, so I look down on most of the "energy" drinks out there because looking at the bottles tells you it's mostly sugar and caffeine. Not to mention most of them taste like crap.<br />These little gems seem to contain mostly vitamins, some natural supplements and some caffeine. I'm a big coffee drinker, so I know when I've had to much, like when I'm jittery or my stomach gets queasy. But I don't get a big rush from the 5-Hour drinks and I don't get a big crash.  It's pretty even for several hours, and it helps keep me focused and a bit more motivated.<br /><br />I usually take regular vitamins and some B vitamins and a little coffee to keep me going, but the formula in these things does the trick on it's own. Wish they were a bit cheaper so I could take when I want - the price limits me to just a couple times a week when I need to get things done.<br /><br />Probably won't work for everyone, but worth a try. Amazon has the best price I can find - down the street I can get them 2/ $5 but that's the best - otherwise they're way over priced.

review/summary: Works gr8!
review/text: I'd about had it for today, just after lunch. My eyes were heavy and my brain was fuzzy. Having a boring work day didn't help one bit. I have also been fighting nodding off while driving (YIKES) every day of the last week. I took a shot of 5 hour energy around 2pm. I am now fully awake and glad I didn't try to drive home sleepy once again. All the flavors have a bite, but I put mine in the fridge when I get here and it takes the edge off the flavor by the time I'm ready to shoot in the afternoon. I don't notice the transition from sleepy to awake or when it's wearing off. This stuff rocks! Too bad about the cost tho.

review/summary: Fantastic Stuff
review/text: This product is a fantastic way of getting a quick boost of energy for almost any situation.<br /><br />Positive<br />+ quick acting<br />+ long lasting<br />+ no jitters or other caffeine related side effects<br />+ Flavor (some people say it is not so great, but compared to other energy drinks this is as good as it gets)<br />+ No crash, just a minor drop in energy.<br /><br />Negative<br />- Sometimes the energy rush won't last 5 hours<br />- if you drink it on a regular basis it loses some of its boost property characteristics<br />- Price<br /><br />I usually only drink a half a bottle at a time and no more than two bottles per week in order to keep feeling the boost effect fully.<br /><br />JP

review/summary: Surprisingly Effective
review/text: I still can't believe these things actually work as advertised, but for the most part they really do. You get a quick, smooth energy boost without being jittery, and no crash later. It's far more pleasant than coffee or Red Bull. However on a couple occasions I have felt a little weird while on this stuff, not jittery, but just a little funny. To counteract that, and also to make this expensive product last longer, I've drank only half a bottle at a time, which really seems to be spot on perfect for me. Great product!

review/summary: Husband prefers it to Red Bull
review/text: For the longest time my husband drank Red Bull to give him that buzz. But it's always short lived so he always brought a few to work. This one seems to be working for him. Obviously it's much smaller than a Red Bull but it gives you more boost. Not 5 hours as advertised but at least a bit longer than Red bull. He likes the taste too.

review/summary: Preferred energy drink!
review/text: This drink is the best energy drink I have found!  I like it because I can feel it work.  It works fast and sustains my energy without giving me shakes or making me hyper.<br /><br />I recommended it to a friend who regular drinks the big cans of energy drinks, and now he drinks these.  It is a lot less of all the bad stuff like artificial sweetener or sugar, and the same amount of the important stuff Vitamin B, caffeine, etc.<br /><br />Cheers!
