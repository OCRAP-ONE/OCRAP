review/summary: Rabitos truffles
review/text: The chocolates are great! I've become addicted to them. The only problem I have experienced with the last two shipments was that the cooling pack was not sufficient to keep them cool enough, so they arrrived half melted. Even though the taste was not changed, the appearance was less inviting and they were stuck to the packaging.<br />I will probably not order any until the weather gets cooler.

review/summary: you've never seen figs like these!
review/text: I received these as a most wonderful gift! I've had my share of fancy chocolates, but I've never had anything like this before. The chocolate creme inside the fig is soft and flavorful. Not too sweet, not at all bitter. It's a really rich, warm truffle with just a touch of liqueur. The dark chocolate coating is delicate and just thick and soft enough to wrap the fig without breaking off when you bite into it. The fig itself is very delicate and moist -- it doesn't seem like a piece of dried fruit.<br /><br />Each piece is individually wrapped so they stay fresh. However, I can't imagine anyone has them for very long. They make a special gift, with a lasting impression. Why not treat yourself?

review/summary: Soooo DELICIOUS!!!
review/text: I wouldn't be the first person you'd ask to taste a dried fig.  Yes, I like dried fruit just fine but I am not obsessed by it.  That was UNTIL I tried Rabitos truffle stuffed figs.  They are amazing!  They are not that typical dense, chewy...  These are plump, the chocolate coating is a fairly thick dark chocolate and when you take a bite...it is a sensation that is almost indescribable.  There is a faint hint of liquor mixed with delectable chocolate and the fruit just sets it off.  I am so glad I got my first two boxes as a set (a Lot18 deal) AND that I gave them a taste. Had I bought just one, the intended gift would never have happened and it would have been a one for me forget the one for you situation.  Silly me, I thought the rest of that box I opened would be doled out as additions to name tags on certain gifts..not so, they are staying put with me although admittedly, there aren't many left and yes, I did share them just a bit.  I reluctantly wrapped the 2nd box for it's intended recipient but have no doubts I will be buying these again and again and again.

review/summary: Nutrisoda, what have you done?
review/text: I discovered Nutrisoda a couple years ago on a cruise to Hawaii.  I was delighted to find it available here on Amazon when I got home.  I ordered several cases of the assorted "rainbow" flavors and was a happy camper UNTIL Nutrisoda changed everything  -  the cans and the flavors!  The "new" flavors, even if they call them by the same names as the originals, are NOT the same.  There are fewer flavors - only four as opposed to the original seven, and these newer sodas, even with the same names, do not taste anywhere as good as the originals.  My favorite was this one  -  the Energize  -  but it's just not the same drink that was in the pretty orange can.  Not sure why Nutrisoda decided to make the changes, but I'm not buying any more.

review/text: Our cats have been on Nutro Natural Choice since they were two months old and are very happy. They love all things chicken so this is their favorite food. We have tried other brand names like Wellness but they won't touch it or will end up throwing it up. (very picky cats) We try to give them good food with as little preservatives and fake meat as possible. This is great food and very affordable, and if you sign up on their website you will even get occasional coupons. All in all, good food, healthy and shiny coats and no hairball at all in their short little two years now. =)

review/summary: Great value, but package arrived opened.
review/text: I'm not sure if it is the fault of Frontier and their packaging and/or shipping process, or Amazon, but one of the three bags was busted or torn open and mustard seed powder was spilling out. I carefully opened the package on arrival so I know I didn't do it. I'm not going to bother returning because it's not worth the hassle.<br /><br />Other than that, this stuff tastes very good, and even after losing one bag out of three, it's still a very good price for the quality. I would give it five stars, if not for the loss of one bag.<br /><br />If anyone happens to know if it is Amazon and not Frontier that is at fault, let me know and I will revise my review to a higher rating.

review/summary: Unfortunately, this one didn't work for me...
review/text: I dislike writing bad reviews, I'm one of those people that believes that if you don't have something nice to say, you shouldn't say anything at all.  BUT, I am a tea reviewer and above all, it is important for me to tell it like it is, and sometimes that requires me to say something is bad when it is.<br /><br />And unfortunately, this Peach Matcha just doesn't hold up to the other Matcha teas that I've tried.  I've tried quite a few of Red Leaf Tea's Matcha (as you can tell by looking at the number of reviews that I've posted), and there have only been two that I've not enjoyed - this one and the apricot.<br /><br />Prepared traditionally using hot water and whisking, this is has a strong chemical taste that is really off-putting.  However ... and this Matcha's one redeeming quality which is why I gave it two stars instead of one ... if you make it as a latte, it ends up tasting much better.  The chemical taste is nearly gone (there are still traces of this taste, but it is very faint) and I can taste the peach and the matcha.  These flavors are also muted a bit because of the milk, but, it makes a nice, tasty matcha latte that tastes of matcha and peach.<br /><br />However, even though the latte was far better than the traditionally prepared Matcha ... I can't give it a higher rating because of that chemical taste.  I do hope that Red Leaf Tea considers finding a better flavoring for the peach and the apricot.  I had high hopes for them.

review/text: My first batch was a little too flavored, but Red Leaf was glad to replace it, which I am very thankful for. With the right flavoring, it's still not one of my favorites, but that could be previous memories of the taste. Peach blends well with the flavor of matcha, though, so it is a very enjoyable drink overall. Be careful with the temperature of water you use to avoid it becoming bitter, and definitely try it cold with just a touch of sweetener!

review/summary: Millions of peaches...
review/text: Millions of peaches...peaches for me! Millions of peaches....peaches for free! Yay! Flashback to the nineties, y'all. This time I've tried the Peach Matcha from Red Leaf Tea, and yum...it takes a bit of fiddling, but once you get it right, it is delicious. A welcome addition to any collection! And keep in mind that I'm still new to matcha and trying to figure it all out.<br /><br />As any good Southern girl would, I have a deep love in my heart for peaches. Deep, deep love. That fruity sweetness...is there anything better? There are few things in this life better than a fresh, juicy peach. A close second is ice cold peach tea. Peach cobbler, peach pie...summer is a good time to be in the South!<br /><br />I opened my package of this matcha and, my wife will back me up on this, my first words were "Whoa, momma!" It smells so good. Like juicy peach candy....nom. It smells painfully delicious.<br /><br />The taste certainly follows up on that scent! It tastes like a big, juicy peach lollipop. It's not a fresh peach, but it's a peach candy. It reminds me of the peach soda I used to get in high school at the local Food Lion to take to our weekly slumber party with my best friend. So I'm grateful for those memories. Makes me want to pop a big bag of popcorn and dip it in nacho cheese. Oh yes, we were super healthy.<br /><br />Anyway, this matcha has the same bitter kick as the lemon matcha, but a touch of sugar chased that away. I think that's just a matcha thing. It's definitely one I want to try again and see how it goes. Maybe cut it with a touch of the vanilla...peaches and cream! Yes please! This would be good in my smoothies this summer, maybe a peach raspberry smoothie dream...nom.<br /><br />I made a second cup with different parameters (12 ounces of water instead of 8 to one half teaspoon of matcha, as well as a bit more sugar) and it is heavenly. Juicy enough to satisfy this Southern gal! Finishing off my sample of this will be no great hardship, I assure you. It tastes like a fuzzy navel without the alcoholic bite! Or those peach gummy candies...yum!<br /><br />I let some of this chill and GAH. Cold, this is beyond amazing. This is what I needed, cold and fruity and peachy! It's not too sweet, it's not too bitter, it's just a beautifully refreshing cold drink for summer...I have a feeling this will be a staple in my cupboard this summer.

The seller plans on clarifing this in their description.<br />Mr. Mallas did say he attended an olive oil convention in Greece and found that the locals make their own kalamata olive oil for themselves and it is not readily available to the public.  The quest will continue....<br />It was a pleasure discussing the many different grades and types of olive oil. I plan on reading the book,<br />Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandale, by Tom Mueller, which he recommended.  I heard the program on NPR, with this review.<br />The Martinis oil I have he said I can keep, with an acidy level of .8 ( whatever that means ) I would only use it to fry fish, or other foods.<br />I am satisfied with the response, in fact Mr. Mallas is a colorfull man, and would look forward to another discussion after completing my<br />education.

review/summary: Best extra virgin oil on the whole planet!
review/text: I have tried MANY different brands of extra virgin olive oil,  and I am extremely picky about the flavor (I only use it raw so I can fully appreciate the flavor). Many oils have pretty much no taste at all. Others are awfully bitter or have a weird after taste.<br />Martinis is just pure perfection. Flavorful like no other but with no bitterness or weird after taste.<br /><br />I also like that the gallon is sold in a can rather than in cheap transparent plastic, like most other brands. Oil absorbs PVC from plastic even at room temperature so it would not be healthy in plastic, while this one in can is perfect.<br /><br />You truly cannot get any better than this, I am totally in love with this oil, I use it almost everywhere, on veggies, fish, pasta, etc etc

review/text: I have been buying MARTINIS Extra Virgin (Kalamata) Olive Oil from Greece at Trader Joe's for several years. I would say I "drink" it daily, but that sounds a bit odd. However, I have "drunk" enough to re-configure my cholesterol! THIS blend from Martinis satisfies my taste buds; I just dip my crusty bread in and UHMMMMM! I try MANY olive oils from the Middle East; I find Italian oil way too heavy. I cook with Martinis; I slurp Martinis, I dip Martinis; yes, I am addicted!! There are a few store brands that come close; I like the slight after taste. Martinis never competes with my food for flavoring. I am thrilled to be able to get the gallon size; no more stuffing my suitcases with the glass bottles (16.9 ozs) when I travel.

I'm Greek and grew up with olive oil and this is the best olive oil I know of. I like it so much it motivates me to eat more healthy salad.<br /><br />The container is thin and easily damaged, so it should be carefully packaged if given as a gift. It has a green plastic handle which some people may like, but I would prefer if Martini's were more eco-friendly and didn't add the plastic. Overall, it is a very fine oil at a reasonable cost.

review/summary: Great stuff!  A nice change from straight tea
review/text: I drink mainly black tea, but there are some green and herbal teas I also enjoy for variety.  Bigelow Orange and Spice herbal tea is one of my favorites--a really zippy treat.  Right from the start, when I do my deep sniff test of the teabag after opening the foil pouch (my favorite moment with tea!), Orange and Spice provides a pleasing combination of citrus and spice aromas.  They are only slightly reduced once the tea is steeped in the cup, so when you're drinking you get the wonderful flavor in your mouth and nose at the same time.  It also has a great aftertaste.<br /><br />Orange and Spice is a true herbal tea, and does not contain any actual black or green tea.  The ingredients listed on the foil pouch are:  rose hips, spices, hibiscus, orange peel, roasted chicory, and natural orange flavors.  I think the orange peel and spices are the strongest flavors.<br /><br />I always drink tea straight--no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it's readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.  If I give a Bigelow flavor less stars, it reflects only my taste preference, and is not a statement of low product quality.

review/summary: My Wife Loves Almost All Bigelow Teas
review/text: Okay, we admit it: we're neither coffee nor tea snobs. In fact, I won't drink tea - real or fake made out of some weird flowers. But every night I make my wife a cup of tea with her dinner. For the past 5 years, I've been using "real" tea from a "gourmet" tea vendor on line. Great stuff that my wife really liked. The leaves were shredded, not pulverized, and one needed a ... ? tea cozy to put the tea in in order to let it steep. Well, our supplier went out of business, and I ordered four different kinds of Bigelow tea including this orange and spice. She loves it, and I've got to say that just heating a cup of water and throwing in a tea bag makes my minor chore minorer. And she can regulate the strength without timing it for 2-5 minutes or whatever.<br /><br />She particularly likes this and the raspberry, and I have to admit I like the aroma that fills our small kitchen. You may not go for this is you are a tea snob, but Earl Grey will suit you fine and I daresay that few people would be able to tell the difference.

review/summary: Orange is not overpowering, good tea to add to your collection
review/text: I'm quite fond of this tea.  Because it is caffeine free, I frequently drink it before bed.  The name is an apt description.  There is a very distinct blend of orange and spice.  Initially, I thought that the orange would be too much.  Orange peel can be strong and overpowering but Bigelow got it right with this tea.  The spicy component is wonderful; it tastes like cinnamon.  I try to avoid adding things to tea.  Sometimes that is not easy but Bigelow's Orange and Spice tea doesn't require honey, sugar or milk.  As a final note, the smell is rich and comforting. I would recommend this tea.

It comes the closest to tasting like it smells (unlike most coffee) I do add one caveat, if you use the ratio of coffee to water they recommend it will be extremely strong, I advise using less coffee and more water but as always, it's a matter of personal preference.

review/text: I first tasted Larry's Beans at the Dripolator Coffeehouse in Black Mountain, North Carolina where I also bought some beans.  This coffee is so full of rich flavor.  Just the right acidity, but not too much.  The coffee almost tastes chocolaty, but really is just a great coffee flavor.  I make this coffee with an Italian stove-top espresso maker.  I mix equal parts coffee with hot milk.  Larry's Beans cost a bit more per pound than your average coffee, but it is worth it.  From the fair trade, to the organic, to the shade-grown, to the compostable plastic bag, to the green business practices, to the great personal customer service...oh yeah....and great coffee!!!

review/summary: Green Tea Mango -- worthy of addiction!
review/text: Bigelow's Green Tea a la Mango infused flavor is hands down a tea drinker's swoon.  I love it, plain and simple.  It makes me happy. The whole house smells better. I believe it's good for me.  We drink it hot and also as iced tea. What else is there?  Well, in a more perfect world, I'd also like it optioned as Decaffeinated too so I could drink it into the night.  I conquer this by brewing half of Green Tea Mango with a Decaf black tea bag and tell myself that there's surely less caffeine in green tea anyway, but heck, I'm not a scientist, I don't know that for sure.  But your taste buds will dance and trust me, you will start carrying these bags to restaurants rather than settling for some hum-drum tea you're offered.  It actually brings a smile to my face.  How else can I say this?  It's amazing even for a coffee drinker like me to find a tea that I'll root for like this one.  The fact that I now keep it stockpiled is my little secret.  But I don't want to ever be without it again.  Now that's some cup of tea....

review/text: I've tried lots of more expensive flavored teas but all of them seem to suffer from either the fruit flavor being so weak that you can barely taste it, or else so strong that it entirely overpowers the flavor of the tea.  This one seems to do a good job of falling in the middle.  The mango flavor is definitely noticeable but (at least to me) not overpowering.  Adds a nice smell to the whole room as well.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Not just green tea and mango....
review/text: I'm a pretty big fan of traditional tea (i.e. not herbal tea).  I figured this would just be green tea with some mango pieces.  I later found out by reading the ingredients, that it has other herbs like chamomile, rose hips etc.  While this tea doesn't taste horrible, I just thought the box was sort of misleading and the amazon community should be aware of these additions.

In my unscientific blind taste test 2 out of 12 people preferred the Callebaut, the other 10 preferred the Bakers.  All said the Callebaut was smoother and creamier, but most said the Bakers was more "chocolaty".<br /><br />The Callebaut was easier to measure and use (I didn't have to chop it up for quicker melting).  Maybe using a 50/50 mixture of each will produce the quality between smoothness and chocolate that I want.

review/text: These are great! My pup looooves them. Usually I give to her after exercising. It's her power bar!! Great quality, NOT from China, which I really appreciate. They are a perfect size (bite size), but sometimes I brake them in 2 pieces for training. I recommend for dog owners that like quality over quantity.

review/summary: Great tea be aware of the packaging
review/text: I have been drinking bigelow tea for five years and enjoy the flavor.  The 40 count packages include ten packages with four tea bags in each rather than one per package.  I drink two cups a day and the teas is still fresh on the second day.  When exposed to air the tea will lose its flavor.  So, if you only drink two or three cups a week look for packaging with one tea bag per package.

review/summary: Not individually packaged in foil and leftover stuff on bottom of cup.
review/text: I bought the Bigelow Green Tea after tasting how delicious the Bigelow I Love Lemon tea is. Here's a few pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price wise - great price, $14.99 after 15% with Subscribe & Save and Free shipping for 240 tea bags comes out to around 6.2 cents each tea bag<br /><br />Cons:<br />Figured they be individually wrapped like the I Love Lemon tea but it's not. These 40 count boxes are not packaged individually in foil packs but there are 4 tea bags in 1 foil pack and not resealable.  Therefore, if you're not a frequent tea drinker, the tea bags might loose freshness after you open the foil pack after a few days.  If you want individually packaged tea bags, you should look at the Bigelow Green Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6).<br /><br />If I leave the tea bag in my cup for more than a minute, I will see loose tea particles on the bottom of my cup, leaving the last mouthful of tea undrinkable. This problem does not happen in the I Love Lemon tea by Bigelow even if I leave the tea bag in my cup for more than 10 mins.  I'm not sure if there's a same problem in the Bigelow Green Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) because I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />Taste wise - okay, same as any ordinary green tea.<br /><br />Drink for health benefits!

review/summary: A very bland and uninteresting green tea
review/text: Bigelow Green Tea is available everywhere in American supermarkets, but it's just not a very good green tea. It produces an amber-colored brew that lacks the crisp tannin flavors that should be in quality green tea. With the prominent drawing of Mount Fuji and distinctive Shinto torii (Itsukushima, a UNESCO world heritage site) on the box, you might think this is Japanese green tea. It is not. No information is listed on where it is grown, except that it is "packaged and blended in the USA".<br /><br />Green tea is very good for health because of the abundance of catechins and flavinoids (antioxidant compounds) and has half the caffeine of black tea. Good Japanese green tea produces tea that is clear pale yellow-green, or very dark green, depending on the tea grade. These helpful chemicals, however, get mostly destroyed during roasting. Catechins are also responsible for the bright aroma and astringent taste of green tea, which is lacking in this product. With its brown leaf particles (see my photo comparison in gallery) and resulting brown liquid, Bigelow is more like hojicha, a roasted green tea. The flavor is very thin and I have to use 2 bags per cup of tea.<br /><br />A much better quality tea is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WB1YSE">Kirkland Signature Green Tea Matcha Blend, 100% Japanese Tea Leaves</a>, which is surprisingly good for a tea sold in non-specialty supermarkets. It is made by Ito-En, one of Japan's biggest beverage makers. I first heard about it because it is the tea used by staff at the Japanese Embassy in DC.<br /><br />As for directions, the ideal temperature for green tea 70-80�C, NOT boiling (100�C) as the product description recommends. Sugar is seldom added to green tea, though it is frequently enjoyed cold.

review/summary: This is Chinese-style green tea, but not bad...
review/text: If you can get past the sort of false advertising in the form of the torii gate and image of Mt. Fuji on the boxes/bags, this isn't a bad *Chinese*-style green tea. (Like other reviewers have said, Japanese green tea looks green when brewed. This tea should be light amber-colored.) If you've ever had Chinese jasmine tea, just subtract the jasmine flavor and this is what you have. Like another reviewer noted, it's not a good idea to steep the bags in boiling water - even though this isn't super-delicate Japanese-style green tea, it'll still taste better if you use a slightly lower-temperature water. (Also, brewing for the full time recommended by Bigelow is probably not the best idea.) Not the best Chinese-style green tea I've ever tried, but certainly not the worst. And it's cheap! And readily-available! And takes sweeteners (and even milk) better than Japanese-style green tea (which I actually prefer but is an entirely different animal).

review/text: As others have mentioned this tea is a good bargain here - also the tea bag option is convenient.<br /><br />I did find this tea lacking in taste, could have been just the batch I received was stale. Found a loose leaf option from Twinings to have much better flavor. It does cost more, but you will also end up getting a lot more tea for your dollar.<br /><br />Overall, if you need the convenience of tea bags, stick with this one, if not, I recommend trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea (Loose Tea)</a>

review/text: I have been drinking tea every day for the past 4 years or so, and this is one tea I have not grown tired of.  It has a delicate flavor, but when I drink it I can tell I am getting lots of antioxidants.  I also like the Celestial Seasonings green teas, but I get bored with those flavors after drinking them for a long time.  Other than this tea, there is only one other tea I have not grown tired of, and it is a loose-leaf tea from Japan that is found in asian grocery stores.  It comes in a purplish metal tin can.  A normal price to pay for this tea is $2-2.50 for a box of 20 bags, so this is a great deal.

Also I did notice the tea bags are not flow-through like when I buy the box of 20 individually wrapped bags. It does say value pack on box so maybe that is why. The tea tastes fine as always, I use a lot of tea so the packaging does not bother me at all. This is a good value and the shipping was free and fast.

review/summary: Quite Impressed!
review/text: I've been drinking this tea off and on for almost a year now, and I must honestly say that I love it.  You can buy it at most local stores, but I choose to purchase it at my local GFS here in MI b/c I seem to get a better deal buying the 60 ct box cheaper there then anywhere.<br /><br />Anywho, I guess I have my own set of rules that I follow.  I bring my water to boil, then add "one" tea bag, turn water down very low and let it sit for about 5 minutes.  It's a very medium color and OK to taste.  I do not add anything to it b/c I don't want to take away anything from it.  In my opinion you totally defeat a purpose adding sugars and things of that nature.  What I'm not too certain of is how many cups to drink per day, so I basically listen to my body. I drink one 32 ounce cup per day--nothing more.<br /><br />Results: I'm not sluggish during the day anymore, the little aches inside my body are non-existent.  I'm losing weight little by little, and this is because the green tea surpresses the appetite.  I'm not running back and forths to my kitchen eating sweets, just because I want them.  I literally do not have a taste for those things for the most part, and when I do, I seem to have more control over how much I really want.  This tea really does work. I'm not jittery from caffiene (although, I'm pretty sure that is what's keeping me awake), I do not have staining on my teeth as some people have claimed on other websites.  The pricing for what I pay is good, but you will probably be able to beat the pricing locally than purchasing from Amazon.

review/text: 5 stars! Delicious!<br /><br />Let me start off by saying, I only like certain green teas (brands/flavors). Not all green tea was created equal!<br />I use to only drink tazo green tea, but that was getting expensive.<br />So, i went out and bought about 12 different brands/types at the store, and this one was my favorite.<br /><br />It's a very delicate flavor just like tazo (in my opinion), and tasted good with or without honey.<br />Keep in mind, this doesn't taste like tazo. Nor, is it a tazo imitator. But, it is an alternative.<br />I actually prefer this taste to tazo.<br /><br />My mother is similar to me in that it's tazo or this stuff in our pantries (I forced her to try this stuff, and she loved it too!). They both seem to have delicate flavors, but each has its own.I prefer mine with a little honey, and my mother likes it without any.<br /><br />I bought this one subscribe and save from amazon. It's a much better deal, and you really can cancel/change delivery dates/change addresses after the first shipment. So, there's nothing to lose.<br /><br />Also, this is a TON of tea, and the best price i have found on it anywhere. :)

review/summary: All the Tea in China can NOT out do Bigelow Teas
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BNE">Bigelow Green Tea, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>I've enjoyed Bigelow Teas for 12 years, particularly, Green Teas.<br />Their other Teas are great also.  I started drinking Bigelow Green Tea because it was accessible in most food stores.  I began with green tea because I believed this is the type of tea served in Chinesse restaurants.  I<br />can't drink coffee.  It doesn't agree with my stomach and it stimulates a "hunger cycle" where I "have to eat" to stop the hunger.  I weighed almost 250 lbs.  I attended OA and understood "food was my drug of choice."<br />So, whether the hunger and craving for food was really stimulated by drinking coffee, I stopped drinking<br />coffee and decided to drink green tea because I had never experienced such cravings with that.  The craving<br />for food could well have been psychological.  Nevertheless, I have been drinking Bigelow Green Tea for 12 years accompanied with healthy eating habits, no diets, I have lost 100 lbs.  The main thought is Bigelow<br />Green Tea is just right for me.  Its mellow.  You won't believe how long I let it brew/steep!  A long time be-<br />cause I like it strong.  I really do recommend this tea to everyone.  Its a great alternative to coffee. You can<br />drink it with or without sugar, cream or milk.  You control how strong you want the tea to be by the length of time you allow it to steep.  Sincerely,  Rev Pat<br /><br />Give them a try.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The price is right.

review/text: I never thought I would be a daily tea drinker but this green tea has converted me. Living in the Southwest where it gets quite hot in the summer, this tea with some ice and just a pinch of honey or sugar is as refreshing as jumping in a swimming pool. You can deepen the flavor by adding more tea bags but i use my automatic 12 cup coffee pot and 6 tea bags to make 12 cups of tea.  That way it steeps as the water passes through as well as it cools.  Try it, you may convert as well!

review/summary: Good price for green tea, 4 bags per foiled pouch
review/text: I'm trying so hard to drink green tea for health benefits. Had a Bigelo 20 bag box, individually foil packed, and bought this bulk pack to save money. This huge pack contains 4 bags per foil, for freshness. Price was far better than Bigelo site, or others online, so bought it. Found them in Sam's Club cheaper the next week.<br /><br />Each tea bag is designed as one upright sack--different from the folded/split bags in my previous Bigelo 20 bag box. These tend to float and require more effort to disperse compared to the previous bags with twice the surface area, in folded pouch design.  It is what it is. To me, green tea is about the most disgusting tasting thing I've ever had, and I hope it grows on me because this is an exercise in sheer discipline. I just hate green tea, but can't fault this product for that. Entire family hates the smell of it, and loathes any taste of it. I hope it is an acquired taste...this is straight green tea w/no sweetener or mitigating flavors.

review/text: I'm drinking this green tea as I type up this review. I made a cup of the Bigelow green tea, and this store brand tea I used to buy because it was the cheapest one on the shelf. The other brand tastes weird and bad in comparison to the Bigelow tea. I guess I didn't even know what green tea was supposed to taste like before I bought this brand. The difference must be that the bigelow bags are sealed in a plastic pouch, tough as other reviewers have noted there are three to a pouch. This isn't a problem for me as I drink 2-3 cups a day anyways. I started drinking green tea simply for the health benefits despite the taste, but now I can drink it for both.

review/summary: Value, flavor, great stuff
review/text: I feel like for the most part, if you're looking for low-priced, good quality, good tasting tea that you can find relatively easy in the marketplace (in America) it basically comes down to this, Lipton, or Twinings. Of those three, I felt the flavor was the best with Bigelow.<br /><br />I've been avidly drinking tea for the past 2 years (around 5 cups a day), and for the price I found this to be the best choice for flavor.<br /><br />It wasn't my final choice for tea to drink on a day to day basis though, as I find the packaging a bit of an inconvenience and Lipton is slightly cheaper (sometimes, prices vary quite a bit). I did like that the tea bags were air-sealed, and felt that helped bring out the flavor more, but found it troublesome to deal with the packets over time. This is a very minor inconvenience but it adds up a bit when you're drinking so much tea a day, and flavor isn't the biggest factor for me.<br /><br />Again though, probably the best tasting value tea I've had. Mileage will vary of course. Still give it 5 stars.

I have since kept the opened wrapper in a plastic bag, but would have prefered the individual wrapping as stated.<br /><br />Overall, the tea is good.  Good flavor when steeped for a few minutes before drinking.  I sweeten it with a little agave & it makes a good cuppa tea.

I have 2 French coffee presses and each morning my husband and I make one pot of coffee and the oher press pot with the green tea. It couldn't be easier. Amazon has the best price on this tea of anywhere so we are happy to buy it in bulk. That is what makes it the best tasting and cheapest to boot.

review/summary: So Good!
review/text: I'm a tea drinker, and this Bigelow Green Tea is of my favorites. This green tea is mild, and has a very light color and a smooth taste. I try to stay away from too much sugar, so I sweeten mine with a few drops of stevia sweetener.<br /><br />I especially go to this tea when I'm sick. It's great hot, and soothes sore throat even better than chicken soup. Tea comes in sealed packets. Last time I ordered this pack was at least a year ago. I just finished my last box, and this one was as good as my first. If you like black tea, try Darjeeling from Bigelow, it's my favorite black tea.

review/summary: nice and light
review/text: I find this tea to be really excellent. I prefer a lighter taste in green tea, and this really 'delivers the goods'. I generally drink 2-4 cups of this a day, and I find it very refreshing. If you want stronger flavor, you can leave the bag in longer, my experience is that it's never bitter or overpowering, regardless of how long you leave the bag in.

review/summary: Too Weak!
review/text: You have to use two bags for one cup. I thought it was a good price at first (around .07 cents a bag) but it's really double that cost.

review/summary: Doesn't have a smoky taste
review/text: Many (if not most) green teas have a smoky taste that I dislike.  This tea doesn't.  Another reviewer describes it as having a hay-like taste.  I agree, that's what I like about it.<br /><br />BTW:  I usually cold brew it overnight.  That yields a lighter taste and extracts a lot less caffeine.

review/summary: Very Bland
review/text: I am a big fan of green tea and I usually drink Japanese green tea. However, supermarkets don't sell Japanese brands so I decided to give Bigelow Tea a try. This tea is tasteless! I don't understand how it can get generally positive reviews. I recommend getting Yamamotoyama, you can find it on Amazon. There are better brands but I know Yamamotoyama is easy to find because of it's popularity. It's inexpensive too!
