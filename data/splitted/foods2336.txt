review/summary: LOVE these!
review/text: Similac Sensitive has been the BEST formula for my son. These on-the-go bottles are PERFECT for travel or even just for when you're out of the house. When we're home, we use our regular bottles that we fill from the jug. But when we're travelling, or just out running errands, I use these. They're 8-ounces each, so they're just the right amount for feeding. The only thing is, they DON'T COME WITH NIPPLES. I bought some Playtex standard size bottles (because they were the cheapest and the right size) and just use those nipples/rings. Then as my son got older, I replaced the nipples with Evenflo's fast flow and used the same ring.

review/summary: Great for nursing moms who supplement with formula!
review/text: I am primarily nursing my baby and I give my baby about four ounces of formula a day. I didn't want to purchase the large bottle because once you open it you need to use it within 48 hrs or throw it away. For me that would be a waste because my baby doesn't go through that much formula in two days. The 8 oz bottles are great for what we need and are very easy to transport!

review/text: I breast fed for 6 months and at bedtime I would be worn out and wouldn't feel like pumping and my husband would want to feed. This was great! Now we use powder and make sure to grab these for whenever we are on the go. I love not having to measure out powder and finding safe water source. We travel 3k miles to visit family and this made it a breeze!

review/summary: Awesome for supplementing breast feeding
review/text: I switched my newborn over to this after some epic farting and crying sessions. My baby definitely has a lot less gas with this formula. I'm both breastfeeding and formula feeding so I wanted a formula that wouldn't send her digestive system into shock. These work great. They are 8 ounce bottles, so it's quite a bit for a newborn to consume, but they are definitely worth it.

review/text: similac sensitive is the formula my 14 week old must be on, for now. It seems to be the formula that agrees with her. She had horrible gas on similac advance, and also on the baby's only lactose free. I like the 8 oz bottles as they are convenient for traveling, etc. However, the powder seems to better agree with my baby's tummy, so i only use these in an emergency.

I always have a supply in the baby bag for trips to the grocery store, a visit to grandmas and the out of blue hungry in the car. Just buy the throw away nipples and you are set.<br /><br />My baby eats 6 oz at a time so at times I just pour the formula in a bottle and cap the rest in the fridge (good up to 48 hours when opened). No need to waste the extra 2 oz.<br /><br />I do recommend buying at the grocery store. I get these for $9.00 at HEB Plus.

review/text: I've been buying this because my husband and I are both lactose intolerant and who wants their baby to be fussy if she doesn't have to be? Two months after starting this formula my baby had jumped from 15th percentile in weight to 90th percentile in weight while still just 15th percentile in height. No one in our family is obese. Today I looked at the ingredient list, first is corn syrup and second is sugar!!! It's not that way on the regular simulac formula. This stuff is horrible, I can't believe I've been poisoning my baby with it!

review/text: I've been using this formula since my baby was born. It's perfect.<br />Definitely help avoiding awful colics. Especially if used in liquid, not powder.<br />The only problem is that it's cheaper at the store: Target, Walgreen, Publix all sell this same package (6 pcs. 8oz. To-Go bottles) for $ 9.99.<br />So it's not worth it to buy it online.<br />Which is a shame.<br />Would love to see some 3-pack or 5-pack special offers!!!!!

review/summary: First two ingredients: Corn Maltodextrin, Sugar
review/text: I was horrified to find I was feeding my twins Corn Maltodextrin* and sugar.  Unless your child is lactose intolerant, consider using Similac Advance or another formula that is made primarily with **milk**.  This product did seem to create less fussiness in our baby, but honestly I think the Dr Brown bottles made a bigger impact.  Make your own trade-off between fussiness vs. nutrition, just be aware of which formulas are made with corn sweeteners and which are truly milk-based.<br /><br />* Definition of MALTODEXTRIN (From Merriam Webster):  any of various carbohydrates derived from the partial hydrolysis of starch (as of corn or potatoes) and used in prepared foods especially as a filler and to enhance texture and flavor.<br /><br />It's misleading for the company to label the product as "milk-based" when it has minor ingredients "derived from" milk.  Read the list of ingredients (below).  I found the ingredients on the parent company's website (Abbott Nutrition).  Don't try to find the ingredients list on the Simlac website -- it's not there (perhaps for good reason).<br /><br />SIMILAC SENSITIVE Ingredients:<br />Water, Corn Maltodextrin, Sugar (Sucrose), Milk Protein Isolate, High Oleic Safflower Oil, Soy Oil, Coconut Oil, Galactooligosaccharides*.

Since she is so small she has some trouble with the size but is getting more used to it and is eating more each day. Was skeptical about sweet potato curbing the "poop appeal" but am slowly thinking there might be something to it.

review/text: This is great dog food, especially for those of us who have trouble feeding our dogs lamb, chicken, or red meat.  I avoided this food for a long time because of the celebrity connection to Dick Van Patten of "Eight is Enough."  For all I know he may not even own the company anymore, but he clearly associated with some knowledgeable people to produce this food.  The ingredients are top grade and the calorie count is excellent: The fish has 323 calories, and the vege has 344 calories, per cup.  This is important when you have any dog, but especially small dogs. My local independent pet store sells this for $13.00.

review/text: Natural Balance Limited Ingredient Dogs Foods are working for my allergy prone cockapoo.  After many years of buying expensive hypoallergenic vet food that still caused gastrointestional problems for my dog...I was wondering if I would ever find a food that he could eat.  I was feeding him boiled chicken and rice when I ran across this product line.  It has been over a month now and he is doing very well.  He is not vomiting and eating grass or having severe gas and bowel problems.  His itching has dminished by at least 70% and he has a twinkle in his eyes again and I'm not pulling my hair out trying to find a solution!  Now we will see how he does on this long term.  Thank goodness there are some products designed for dogs with allergies that do work.

However, I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of two reasons:<br /><br />1. These treats need to be refrigerated upon opening.<br />2. These are harder than the pure bites brand. There are some big chunks and little chunks so I need to use a scissor to cut the bigger pieces into bite sized pieces otherwise the cat just gobbles the whole thing down.

review/summary: Very good instant coffee
review/text: Picked this up on a whim at a big chain store because the coffee looked good compared to the other "crummy" instants. As far as instant goes, I think it is the best affordable non-flavored brand on the market. It doesn't have the funny, woody, or bitter after tastes that a lot of the other less expensive brands (Folgers, Taster's Choice) have. Very good when mixed with a good hot chocolate and a little milk or non-dairy creamer. Bonus is a good caffeine kick when compared to the flavored instants.

review/summary: Smooth with a better than average taste
review/text: I recently purchased this at a big box store. I don't usually drink instant coffee - normally I do the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014CVEH6">Melitta Ready Set Joe Single Cup Coffee Brewer</a> single cup brew method.<br /><br />If your goal is to have a good cup of coffee without the waste an auto-drip entails then I highly recommend the Melitta. As long as you keep the filter cone clean, which is easy, and you measure your ingredients, bad coffee will be a thing of the past. It won't make awful tasting coffee magically taste good but it will make passable coffee taste better cup for cup.<br /><br />Actually, that is why I switched to brewing with a pour over cone filter. With auto-drips bad coffee is a frequent experience, for me no matter who brewed it. Anyway, back to the instant stuff.<br /><br />It's instant. I've never had a cup of instant that didn't have an aftertaste and this product is no different. However, how bad the aftertaste is greatly distinguishes one brand from another more so, I think, that the actual coffee taste.<br /><br />BuenDia's flavor is good. It has a solid coffee taste to it. The aftertaste is there but not obnoxious unless you brew it really strong. The directions call for 1tsp for 8 oz of water but I use 2tsp for about 10oz of water because I like a stronger cup of coffee. I noticed that when I brewed it per the directions the aftertaste was substantially milder.<br /><br />It doesn't dissolve immediately either. Even with boiling water. That could be a real problem and if you've ever gotten a sip with an undissolved crystal you know what I mean. It does dissolve eventually. The odd thing is I've sipped these partially dissolved crystals without experiencing that terrible intense flavor.<br /><br />Big box stores are probably substantially less expensive than an on-line purchase. Shop around.

I haven't made a full pot of coffee in weeks because this instant coffee has great flavor and it is smooth but not bitter.  The only con about this coffee is it is a little more expensive sold through Amazon. This product is around $4.50-5.50 on here while Walmart sells it for around $3.78 (for 1). All I have to say is try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LJ95GC">Buendia by Juan Valdez Classic 100% Colombian Freeze Dried  Coffee,  3.52 oz.

I found it at a local store, thought I would try it, and ever since, that's all I've bought!  My husband has been a coffee drinker for 42 years.  For 23 of those years he was a cop, and he always had his cup of coffee with him, and if he likes it, well it's got to be just that good.  The only down-side to this is, we only have one store in the area that has this coffee on the shelf, so when it's not there, we suffer, until another shipment comes in.  I've learned always to buy extra, to keep on hand, and have spread the word about this coffee.  If you want a good cup of brew...look no further than, Juan Valdez's Cafe Buen Dia!!

review/summary: Good coffee, horrible price
review/text: The quality of this coffee is second to none, to the point where, even as a "Coffee Snob", I'll reach for this on some mornings where I just can't wait the 4 minutes for a pot of French-press coffee.<br /><br />That said, the price on this offering is outlandishly expensive, more than twice the price easily found elsewhere via a simple online search.<br /><br />In short, absolutely buy the coffee if you don't mind the 100% markup.

review/summary: Buendia by Juan Valdez, Columbian Freeze Dried Coffee
review/text: We are doing some long term camping and so I can no longer use an electric coffeemaker.  I have never used a perculator, and so had to switch to instant coffee, much to my chagrin..... UNTIL, that is, I discovered Buenda by Juan Valdez.....YUM!  I may never return to ground coffee.  Give this a try, folks - it is truly delicious.

review/text: I had been getting Taster's Choice Columbian but they now only make in single servings which can get a bit pricey.  So I decided to try this.  Not bad, just don't like nearly as well as the Tasters Choice, so when I use an instant, I just cough up the money to get the individual "sticks" of it.

review/text: Don't be fooled by all the positive reviews.  I've been looking for an instant coffee that is a reasonable fascimile of real drip or brewed coffee and based on the reviews here , I purchased this stuff.  As background, I Like the taste of real coffee, so I drink my coffee black, with no sugar!  I think it would be impossible to drink this stuff that way.  It tastes like sewage..  ughh...  I can choke down Nescafe instant coffee if I have to.. but this stuff is awful!!  I have no idea how anybody could even remotely compare this to real coffee..  Maybe if you used 10 teaspoons and sugar and 2:1 ratio of milk or cream, it might be palatable.. but as a for real coffee flavor.. yuck!!

review/summary: Great for that 'quick cup of Joe'
review/text: If the world only had instant coffee available, this coffee would easily merit at least 4 stars, but in reality there are better tasting coffees out there. Nevertheless, as an 'above average instant' I have enjoyed this coffee for that quick cup - when brewing a full pot is inconvenient. Since I usually drink my coffee black, I learned that making stronger can almost ruin the experience. As a solution for this 'mistake' I simply add some hot cocoa with good effect. However, as stand-alone coffee I will only give it an 'above average' 3 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />If you are looking for a better tasting instant, the delicious alternative 'Jacobs Kronung' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00469SF62">Jacob's Coffee Jacobs Kronung Instant, 7.05-Ounce (Pack of 2)</a> is my pick.

review/text: Tried this tea at a nearby cafe. It was served hot with whipped cream. 1.95 per cup.  My friend and I were instantly hooked. The cafe's gift shop sold the tea for 1.75 per packet. We came home and found this deal. Now we buy the tea here. We were told by the cafe owner to add very hot (to boiling) water to the cup. This mixture has to seep for a few minutes. Now we can have this great tea at home for less than a third the price. I took a few packets in my luggage when visiting my daughter. She does not care for chia tea of any kind. She was also hooked on the tea's spicy creamy taste. Beware of trying this one. You may have a new favorite hot and cold beverage!

review/summary: Absolutely Amazing
review/text: The color is a rosy plum, and its scent, like most juices, indicative of the fruit used in it. (read: it smells like black currant!) The carbonation is perfectly fantastic, just like all Kristian Reg&aacute;le (see the link in the sidebar), with it's zesty bite that's not over the top, and full of tiny bubbles. It doesn't completely dissipate on your tongue like some of this style of drink does. Its on the drier side of Kristian Reg&aacute;le, which is quite dry for a juice, still sweet for a wine. It's fairly acidic, medium bodied and on the bold side. Fresh plums come to mind while drinking it.<br /><br />It cleanses well, and it'd pair well with lots of foods. Steaks, pastas, pork and even some desserts. It's very versatile, and complimentary to lots of foods. The ingredients list is gleefully short. Water, apple & black currant concentrates, beet sugar, carbon dioxide, natural flavors and citric acid.<br /><br />This is now my favorite Kristian Reg&aacute;le drink. it's more nuanced and sophisticated than the pomegranate, and a bit more versatile. it's as wine-like as you can get in the sparkling world, without going for de-alcholized wine. I'm definitely adding this to my table drink list, and with how often we use Amazon to order things, a case of this will be on my Birthday and Christmas lists indefinitely.<br /><br />We drank this with Spinach Procsuittio Noodle Casserole.<br /><br />My favorite Kirstian Reg&aacute;le so far, 10 out of 10

review/summary: Tastiest Refried Beans I've Found
review/text: Far and away the best canned refried beans out there. I must not be the only one who thinks so because they are hard to find even at Whole Foods. This specific variety is often sold out. So easy to buy a case at Amazon! The 12-pack I received was shrink-wrapped in a cardboard tray and packed in another box, but not well enough. Due to the poor packing, all cans were dented at their top...every single one! I'm happy to report, however, that the denting did not harm the fantastic taste and texture of these beans.

We could, possibly, drive a couple of hours and maybe find it somewhere else but with the price of gas it is not feasible.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for carrying this product.

review/text: I guess I had no idea how used to drinking "bad coffee" I had become.<br /><br />I use my Senseo single-serve machine to make coffee simply for convenience sake, and I had been using the Senseo brand coffee pods.  Well, no more of that.  I ordered through a third party to receive a bunch of samplers, and I received a package of this Baronet Cinnamon Hazelnut as a tree sample.<br /><br />First of all, the pods are individually wrapped, which I think does quite a bit to preserve freshness.  Now the flavor can't compare to cup of freshly roasted and freshely ground beans, but this was pretty dang tasty for a preground coffee.  There was only the slightest hint of bitterness, and the delectable cinnamon undertones really made up for that.  I've never had cinnamon in coffee before, but I have a feeling I will be having it again.<br /><br />I have about 30 different kinds of coffee pods to try.  I'll try to post a review of each one as I drink them.

review/summary: Love these for my grandson
review/text: My grandson, 19 months old, loves traditional cheese puffs, however, the adult version has way too much salt, dyes and other chemicals.  The disaster of getting the orange off of his hands after some cheese puffs was something I always dreaded.  One day when I was in a local baby buying warehouse store and my grandson grabbed a bag of these at the cash register so I bought them for him to eat in my truck.  He loves these things and so does grandma...LOL  They are healtier than traditional cheese puffs, they don't have all that bright orange dye on them and I was able to order them in bulk here on my favorite place to shop, Amazon!!!  You just can't get any better than that.  The only thing I would suggest is buying the smaller bags if you aren't going to eat them all in one sitting.  Due to the lack of preservatives in them they become stale pretty quickly once they are opened.  So if you buy a large bag and plan on clipping the bag shut to eat more later, you will come back to a bag of stale puffs.

review/summary: Wild Hare Teriyaki Jerky - Sweet with a bite!
review/text: I purchased the Wild Hare Teriyaki Jerky as part of the add-on program along with the Cajun and Original Beef flavors. My family loves jerky and I thought it would be a good opportunity to sample something besides our usual grocery store stand-by.<br /><br />Size: The 3 oz bag contained 10 square and triangle pieces of jerky - not the usual strips that we usually get<br /><br />Texture: Thinly sliced, cut on the cross grain so you can shred it apart into smaller chunks for bite-size pieces. Looks like hand cut beef instead of something processed. It's very slightly crispy - maybe from the caramelization from the sugar<br /><br />Flavor: The teriyaki is very subtle, slightly sweet - tastes more like it was marinated than covered in teriyaki sauce. Peppery like the Original Beef which gives it a bit of a spicy bite! I love pepper, so that totally works for me...<br /><br />Value: I paid $5.52 for the 3 oz package which gave me the opportunity to try the Cajun and Original Beef flavors. Of the three, the teriyaki was my favorite and I will definitely try it again.

review/text: My 6 year old kitty was losing weight, vomiting constantly, and had loose stools.  The vet could not find anything wrong with her.  She lost more and more weight, had poor fur and low energy.  I was resigned to losing this very sweet cat.  She was eating one of the most expensive cat foods. One day in the grocery store I noticed a display of all the Purina One products.  I bought a bag of Sensitive Systems cat food.  When I put some in her bowl, she meowed while eating it!  Within days I saw an improvement in her energy level.  She is now doing great, correct weight, good fur.  For some reason, the store quit carrying this, so now I order it for her.

review/summary: frequent problem batches of this food
review/text: We were purchasing this food regularly for our four cats, mainly because one cat has a sensitive stomach and this was the only grocery store brand that sat well with him.  Last year we got a bag of food that looked darker than usual.  The cats wouldn't eat it.  We purchased another bag and it was fine.  The next bag again looked darker; the cats ate it, but all four vomited it up immediately after eating it.  Again, we purchased a new bag where the food was the same color we were used to and the cats were fine.  I hesitate to admit this, but I did test the bag of darker food and, again, it made the cat who tried it sick.<br /><br />It was obvious that the food was bad, so I called Purina.  They insisted that nothing was wrong with their food.  They wanted to send me coupons for free food instead.  I asked to please make a record of this food being bad -- I offered to send the leftover kibble to them, I tried to give the customer service woman the bag code, but she refused to do anything. She flat out said she would not take the batch code down because nothing was ever wrong with their food.  When I got off the phone, I made a copy of the code from the bag and sent a letter, but never received a response.<br /><br />When I called the grocery store, I got the manager who said they had already removed the food from the shelves because of so many complaints.  He said they would send the food back to Purina.  Because of the cat with the sensitive stomach, I kept buying Purina Sensitive Systems and spent 6 months checking the batch codes to make sure we didn't get another bad bag.  Figuring that the situation had resolved, I stopped checking bag codes, only to find out the hard way the grocery store had not sent the food back to Purina but instead quietly put the bad food back on the shelves.  That time only one cat ate the food, but he vomited so much there was blood in it.  We took him to the vet and while there realized it was probably the food again, and sure enough, the batch code matched the previous bag that had made all the cats sick. (As far as I know, the cats did not have permanent health problems because of this food.)<br /><br />I highly recommend avoiding this brand.  We have had cats for 20 years and have used 3 brands regularly during that time; Purina is the only one that has caused this kind of problem.

review/summary: Sensitive systems
review/text: We have four foster cats at a time, and one is always having a problem with whatever food we buy. So we decided to go with the sensitive system. Since, we haven't had any problems. And the main ingredient is turkey, overall decent, although not the best ingredients, but very effective for sensitive kitties.

review/summary: Cat loves it, noticed a difference right away with him!
review/text: We originally had the Purina One hairball for my rescued cat (per their recommendation), but he does have a sensitive tummy and would have really loose stools, and have them at least 4x's a day.  So I switched to Sensitive Systems, and I LOVE it.  My cat had no problem with the change, he chows down on this, and after a couple weeks of using this, I have noticed that his coat is very sleek, soft and healthy.  He hasn't shed in a while now, and he used to be pretty bad.  Over the last two weeks since being on it (it did take him a good week for his system to "firm up") he is now only going roughly 2x's a day, and they are all normal, not wet or loose.  Very happy with this purchase, it did exactly what I hoped it would with the benefit of helping his fur too!  No complaints with the shipping or packaging either.

review/summary: Nice Machine
review/text: I purchased this as a Christmas present for my 10 year old because he is always asking me for quarters for vending machines (as all 10 year old boys do). Assembly was easy but upon delivery, one of the two locks was inoperable. Gumball Machine Warehouse was great, as I sent one e-mail, had a response in less than a day and a replacement lock in the mail asap. This allowed me to have it assembled and under the tree before Christmas. Installation of the replacement lock was fairly simple. After that, the machine worked great. I filled the middle compartment with Double Bubble, the left with Runtz and the right with Skittles. No problems functionally after two dozen quarters or so. My son loves the machine and is showing it off to all his friends, telling them to bring quarters when they come over. I gave five stars because I think this machine is perfect for our use, but I need to note that for commercial use, I believe it only suitable in a supervised location. The locks could be defeated with a sturdy, large screwdriver. We are completely satisfied and it's a great machine for the price.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N8N4IY">Triple Vend Candy & Gumball Vending Machine</a>

review/text: we have several of these machines we use in our vending biz . the all metal construction is nice , the spill tray is a wonderful touch that shop owners really like , and the red color is really eye catching . my only complaint so far ,is the coin mechanisim isnt easily replaced . thankfully we havent had any issues ( they are all metal also ) ,but we have other machines where the coin mechanisims pop right off after we remove the candy container , which is a nice touch if there is a coin jam, or mechanisim failure . one thing to note, if you get the machine keyed the same top and back ,it is soooo quick to service ( with one key) . coin trays in back make at all really quick and easy . removing candy ( if needed) is a bit of a different story . since the "clear out shoot" in the bottom dont really do anything ( dont work for us vending mike ikes-peanut mm) the only way to get candy out is ....one scoop at a time . so if your constantly changing product ,definately look at a different machine . id suggest the lypc triple pod ( canisters remove ,coin mech can be easily removed OR upgraded to .50c) although i dont have any yet ...hmm ,i think i will order one now

review/summary: Absolutely the best tasting GF pasta around!
review/text: I've tried them all, Tinkyada, Mrs. Leepers, Le Venezienne, etc. Most were good to passable, but this pasta is the greatest and closest yet to real pasta.<br /><br />Still retains a decent al-dente bite and even reheats fairly well as well, but you will need to a teaspoon of water in your container before nuking.<br /><br />I wish though that GF pasta would cost less.. imported pasta from italy typically is on sale for .50 to .75 a lb, but corn pasta from italy costs roughly $4.50 or more a pound.. someday there will be enough demand or competition to drive down these costs.<br /><br />Till then Schar rules and is worth the extra money when stacked against it's competition in the GF pasta market.

review/summary: Tastes like real pasta! (Tricky to reheat)
review/text: My husband and I bounce back and forth between Schar and Ancient Harvest for gluten free pastas. Schar is more similar to standard pasta in taste, and we love the penne shape, but we haven't figured out the trick for reheating it. (It doesn't taste or feel right reheated for some reason. We tend to throw the leftover sauce on top - so maybe keeping them separate and adding water to the pasta dish will help.)<br /><br />If you're looking to try a different brand though -- one that reheats normally -- I recommend Ancient Harvest e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTBDQ">Ancient Harvest Quinoa Organic Pasta Gluten Free, Elbows, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: This is GF?
review/text: I just tried to do this review and the computer did something weird, so if it shows up twice, sorry.<br /><br />This brand is the absolute best!  The fact that it's the best selling GF pasta in Europe should tell you something.  I like rice noodles for Asian cooking but need Schar's for my Italian recipes.  I have tried all the major brands of GF pasta and this beats all hands down.<br /><br />I keep trying to make extra each time I cook so I can have leftovers for lunch, but I end up eating all of it - OINK!  It also seems lighter on my stomach and I don't have that heavy sluggish feeling after eating it, like what happened with wheat pasta in the past.<br /><br />If you are still stuck on Tinkyada etc., give yourself a break and try this - you will be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />They have a great website and their nutritionist is very helpful (and GF too).

review/summary: Great GF alternative
review/text: One of the most disappointing things about switching to a GF diet was the quality of the gluten free pasta that's more readily available at the standard grocery.  When I found Farmo pasta at a high end grocery store here, I fell in love-- but came to Amazon to find better prices. Once it was discontinued, I was led to Schar pasta.  It's equally delicious.  Both the Farmo and Schar have a texture more like wheat flour pasta and less starchy chaos when cooking. It's actually possible to use in baked pasta dishes (a nightmare for corn- or rice-only blends for me).  I do wish it was available for Subscribe & Save. But, I'm happy it's available at all!

Have you been trying a lot of different brands of pasta looking for something that taste like the old pasta that you used to eat before being diagnosed with Celiac disease?  This is the pasta that you have been looking for, a light and tasty gluten free pasta.  The rest of my family prefer to eat this pasta then regular wheat pasta which makes it easier to cook a meal.  I don't have to worry about cooking regular wheat pasta for them and gluten free pasta for me.  Also I like that this past is 12oz unlike many other pastas that only gives you 8oz for the same price.

review/text: We have been a gluten free family for almost 2 years. We have tried many different gluten free pastas and so far the Schar pastas are the best. They hold up better to cooking and taste most like our old pastas (prior to needing a gf diet, we used both regular and whole wheat pastas). I have used the pastas in making dishes for adults and kids and everyone likes them. I will say, I haven't found a gluten free pasta that holds up well as leftovers, as the wheat based pastas did, but my kids don't seem to mind it as leftovers.

Read the history behind Schar's and you will realize why their products get a 5/5 rating. Simply the best!

review/summary: Where are the mercury test results? Try Nordic Naturals instead.
review/text: I contacted Lil' Critters customer service several times to request that they provide test results for the mercury levels in their Omega-3 supplements.  With some relatively recent news suggesting that actual levels were higher than those reported for some manufacturers, I was concerned about what amounts my kids were ingesting.<br /><br />My initial request for information was responded to with someone in their customer service organization named Hollie who essentially said the same thing their website does - that these are tested very carefully and that they are safe.  I requested that she forward the test results.<br /><br />No response.<br /><br />I waited a couple of weeks and asked again.<br /><br />No response.<br /><br />I asked again, indicating I wanted to continue purchasing these items from Costco if I was satisfied with the results and that I did not want to post my concerns in a public forum.<br /><br />No response.<br /><br />Given they are marketing these items for consumption by young kids at an age where their bodies and brains are so dependent upon proper nutrition, I would think a manufacturer with faith in their products would respond to a customer request pretty promptly.<br /><br />They haven't.  So I will be switching to another manufacturer who is a little more transparent with their product information.<br /><br />Update on August 9, 2010<br /><br />For those of you who have read the post that these gummy bears only contain plant-based ingredients, please check the container for yourself.  On the one I have, it says in bold italics underneath the ingredients list that the product DOES CONTAIN FISH!  Specifically, the product contains anchovy, sardine, mackerel and tuna.<br /><br />Note that the Environmental Defense Fund has a list [...] which outlines their recommendations for the maximum number of servings of various fish species that kids should have per month.<br /><br />Mackerel and tuna are on this list and are almost unsafe at any consumption level.<br /><br />In my view, this product should not be trusted unless the company provides testing results, and as far as I can tell, they have not done that.<br /><br />Update on August 15, 2010<br /><br />I just received my first shipment of Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Gummies, and my kids love them.  No fishy taste whatsoever!  They test their products vigorously and meet more stringent European standards for contaminant levels.  Yes, they are more expensive, but having the peace of mind of a better product is worth the expense.  Check them out.

review/summary: Probably the best taste for kids
review/text: We bought this after my daughter started refusing liquid omega-3 cod liver oil.  It's OK- it's softer than a regular gummy and does taste about as much like candy as an oil can probably get.  I do not like the taste of it myself as it does have a subtle hint of fish taste in it, which is wierd in something that tastes otherwise like candy, but my daughter does not seem to notice the fish.  It is VERY subtle so I am not sure many kids would notice. I do not like that it only has about half the amount of omega 3 as a liquid, but if you are having trouble getting your child to take omega 3 liquids this might be a helpful solution.<br /><br />I had to edit this to say that after the second day my daughter started to refuse this, saying it is yucky.  She tasted one of the yellow ones on the second day and had to spit it out.  3 year olds can be very finicky. We're trying the nordic naturals strawberry flavor next, LOL!

review/text: Like many people who have heard about the benefits of fish oil, I tried taking Omega-3 fish oil capsules. All was fine and dandy except that the fish oil capsules make me feel nauseous, and despite trying everything, I ended up belching up the disgusting taste of tuna ALL DAY LONG no matter how much food I ate, what type of food. The regular capsules were disgusting.<br />My stomach is sensitive to vitamins, so I have been taking the regular gummy vitamins, along with an iron supplement.<br />Seeing that this brand has worked so well for me in the past, I decided to purchase these gummy fish [...].<br /><br />Yes, they do smell and taste faintly of fish. But hello people! It's FISH oil. Of course it's going to smell and taste that way! If you're like me and find the "grown up" version of these to be absolutely stomach churning, then the gummi version will be a welcome addition to your vitamins collection.<br /><br />They are fruit flavored, and the fruit taste is what lingers around, not the fish one. Yes, it's weird to have fruit and fish together. But these do not upset my stomach, or leave me tasting fish all day long. So it's worth it.

review/summary: These Omega 3 gummies taste GREAT
review/text: I've just purchased this product today and have taken two gummies myself, just to taste it before giving them to my sons, a 7 years old and a 5 years old. The good news is: they also like the gummies. The taste didn't bother us. I don't think it tastes fishy at all. It tastes just like a regular gummy, except, they are much softer than the regular one. If they can make it a bit more tender, that would be perfect.<br /><br />There are no such thing as "smart pills", as we all know. However, Omega 3 fatty acid does support and enhance the functions of our brains. After I read the nutrition facts label on the bottle and did some researches online and read books, I decided to give it a try. Hopefully it would help my kids and give their brains some "boost".

review/summary: All Four of My Kids Like Them!
review/text: I am pretty surprised at the other reviews.  I have been buying these gummies from L'il Critters for at least a year, maybe longer, because I knew that we weren't including enough fish in our diet at home.  The kids (ages 4-11) have NEVER balked at them and happily gobble them up.  These are pretty picky eaters.  Except for my youngest, these kids cringe and make faces over all vegetables and any other things that I might desire for them to eat, including the Coromega fish oil supplement that I tried to get them to eat in the past.  Basically, three of them are highly sensitive to anything that they think might taste gross.  And what I am telling you is that when I get them out, the first one that sees them shouts "GUMMIES!"  and all the others come running to get theirs. As an added bonus, the product is also made in the USA.  What's not to love?

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: These are actually not as bad tasting as some other reviewers would lead you to believe.  My 5 and 7 year old children really like them.  I sampled one myself, and there is a faint fishy taste, but nothing overwhelming at all (and not even noticeable to the kids).  I have purchased Nordic Naturals in the past, and they liked those as well, but that brand isn't available at my local grocer.  I started my kids on fish oil supplements because my son has asthma, and studies have shown that fish oil is helpful.  He has been on a daily supplement for about 5 months now, and I am amazed at how much better his asthma is.  It has also cured my daughters eczema (I have no idea why but she has had horrible eczema for months now and it went away within a week).  Amazing.

review/summary: I might have to throw them away
review/text: I bought these for my 4-year old son.  He enjoys taking his daily vitamin, especially the gummy kind.  I figured this product would be a great way to incorporate some omegas in his diet (as he typically won't eat fish).  I gave him one and he begged me to spit it out.  He did finish that one but he refuses to eat any more.  My husband decided to eat one himself -- just to see if the 4-year old was over-reacting.  My husband wanted to spit it out also -- he said that they were absolutely terrible.  Needless to say -- I have decided not try it for myself.

review/summary: Kid's
review/text: I have found that these are great my daughter has no problem taking them.  I tasted them and compared to cod live oil it's night & day. I have read other reviews that say their children will not take them well that has nothing to do with the product.  My daughter has always been a very good student even before taking the Omega 3. One thing I can say is since she has been taking them with a multiVitamin she has be quite healthy.

review/summary: Give it time
review/text: My seven year old son after initially saying he would take these, refused after the first few days so we gave up for a few weeks. Then miraculously he started taking them (wants to be extra smart in school) and now takes a full dose without a problem. I guess it is easier to reason with a seven year old.

review/summary: Plant Based Omega-3s; Not fish oil base.
review/text: I felt compelled to write a review after seeing so many reviews saying that these gummy omega 3s tasted "fishy" and questioning the mercury content.  To quote the L'il Critters insert in our most recent bottle, these vitamins contain "plant-based omega-3 formula with DHA".  This would explain why there isn't testing as to the mercury levels -- b/c the omega-3 doesn't come from fish.  As to the taste, I admit that I thought they tasted a bit fishy through our first two bottles and rarely took them myself, as the thought of gummy fish oil grossed me out.  Once I realized they were plant based, I tried them again.  Strangely, now they taste fine to me.  I think the combination of the fish shape of the vitamins, my mistake of thinking they contained fish oil, and my past experience with my own fish oil pills resulted in this phenomenon.  At any rate, my kids like them and take them regularly.  Hope that helps.

review/summary: Something is Fishy Here!
review/text: This is no Chef's Taste award winner - maybe the brand won the award, but no one could have tasted these Omega 3 Gummies. They invoke thoughts of week old seafood gumbo left in a hot car or maybe 'red tide' flavored gummies. We were actually looking to improve on Nordic Naturals, strawberry but now are going running back to the Nordics. I am not sure anyone in our family can choke down these giant squishy, fish blobs. Even my non-picky child is grossed out by these. I can barely manage to swallow one only if I cut (not bite) one in half then swallow each piece without chewing. There goes my 20 bucks, unless maybe they are good for the dog? Hmmm...

review/summary: My puppy loves it
review/text: This is definately chihuahua puppy approved. I like the fact that there is a puppy food for smaller breeds. These are real small bites. My puppy was 2.16 lbs at 7 weeks and tiny, so having something that is small enough for him to chew. At 5.5 months old, he still enjoys it. I also like that this small bag is resealable and helps with keeping it fresh.

review/summary: dog food review
review/text: I have been using this dog food for quite some time, until my dog started throwing up and basically wouldn't eat much of this dog food anymore like he used to.  I stopped feeding him this dog food and bought organic.  My dog started eating again and stopped throwing up. I will not be buying this dog food anymore.

review/text: Hill's Science Diet Puppy Small & Toy Breed dog food provides precisely balanced nutrition to meet your small breed dog's special needs.It is the only brand with an exclusive blend of clinically proven antioxidants.This formula is specially designed to boost immune defenses and support the long life expectancy of small and toy breed dogs.<br />There a myths that allergies are caused by ingredients such as corn but that is not the case. To say that something is a filler would imply it has no nutritional value; when in fact corn is a superb source of nutrients. There is a misconception that whole corn is used - in fact the corn is baked and is much like ground corn you buy. When cooked it is highly digestible.We hear many concerns about by-products in pet food. We need to understand how they are defined and what they really are and what is their nutrient value.<br />By-products is really a play on words. Virtually all ingredients in pet foods are by-products. No one for example uses real chicken breasts as we know it.It's neck and backs of a chicken.<br />Another common myth is that meat should always be the first ingredient, inferring that if that was the case, there would be more meat than anything else in the food. Often the carbohydrates levels are higher than the meats because of the way they are listed in the ingredient panel.Meat first is often the first ingredient only to please the consumer look st the ash levels and mositure levels, and ingreident spliting.<br /><br />I have fed Science Diet to my two dogs and I am very happy with the results. They love the food, it seems to have a good nutrient profile, my dogs have not had any gas or loose stool, in fact the clean up has been minimal so far, poop is much smaller and less of it that ever! I keep searching the yard with the scooper several times a day and there just isn't much to clean up! I can honestly say that they are going HALF as much as they were before! I never would have believed it, considering that there is a considerable amount of corn in these formulas.<br />My dogs were itching, had greasy coats and dandruff all at the same time! I was frustrated and worried for them...after a relatively short time, one of the dogs has virtually stopped itching and the other has decreased her itching intensity.<br /><br />I do wish the food was less expensive.
