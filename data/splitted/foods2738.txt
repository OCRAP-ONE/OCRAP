review/summary: Healthy and delicious!
review/text: If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are "meaty" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!

review/summary: Not the same as the canned version
review/text: I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond "Roasted Almonds - Honey" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very "off" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and "other natural flavors", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not "slivered" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned "Honey Roasted Almonds" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased.

review/summary: Too Much Sugar!
review/text: This is basically candy masquerading as a "healthy" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack.

review/text: I love these almonds!!  They taste just like a snickerdoodle cookie, but make for a much healthier snack!  One of my favorites of the Blue Diamond Oven Roasted varieties.  Buying them in a 6-pack is more cost-effective for me, especially now that I can't find them in my grocery store. I wish they came in the large resealable bag like some of the other flavors, but for now I'll stick with the 6 container pack.

review/text: I wouldn't call these almonds sweet, but they do have just the right hint of sweet flavor that the almond is elevated and feels like a treat.  The taste and texture of almonds doesn't particularly appeal to me, but they're such a healthy snack that I'm glad to find this delicious option.  Also, the small container is the perfect size to have on your desk or keep in the car, or use as stocking stuffers like I plan to do for a couple of my healthy eating conscious friends!

review/summary: Should almost be labelled a "BOLD" flavor
review/text: Butter Toffee is not a flavor I thought I would like - for some reason the name makes me think of an icky flavor. However, I became hooked at first bite. This flavor is much sweeter than the Honey Roasted. It certainly becomes my top "dessert almonds" when in need of that sweet replacement.<br /><br />Absolutely great for those on a low-carb or Keto diet - only 6 Net Carbs per serving. The bold, sweet flavor keeps you satisfied after only a small amount.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: After trying every kind of almond out there over the years, I will take these flavorful Blue Diamond almonds any day.  They are fresh, salted just right and not greasy/oily.  I try to eat a handful a day, usually as a mid-afternoon snack for optimum health benefits. The handy container is easy to use and even indicates portion size.  Unfortunately, this type of almonds is getting more and more difficult to find in my local stores, so I was happy to be able to order a 6-pack from Amazon to have in my pantry.

review/summary: Yummy in my Tummy :)
review/text: I ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago, as I often find myself jonesing for junk food, and I thought that if I had something that was good for me around, I would be less likely to grab something terrible.  These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)

We can all do that, right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception.

review/summary: The best almonds on earth!!!
review/text: I must say, these almonds have made me a lover of nuts!!!  I have always been a cashew girl and never cared that much for almonds. Well, being on a low carb diet made cashews a no no.  Almonds roasted only with sea salt are soooo good. Blue Diamond makes the best tasting and these are hard to find in stores.  I love the 1 lb bag of these, but can't seem to find them. Buying these in bulk was the best deal out there and I will have to purchase again.  Thanks, Blue Diamond for a superior nut!

review/text: So the hottest-hot-off-the-press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away.... and for good reason.  They're full of B (and other) vitamins, fiber, --not-cholesterol, not-sodium, not-empty calories, and not tasteless wallpaper paste....<br /><br />But these --- these new Blue Diamond almonds (I've so far tried both the Brown Sugar Cinnamon and the Vanilla -- are soooooo good that it's hard to stop at an ounce.  This has become my after-dinner treat.<br /><br />To help fight the sodium bugaboo, they've instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder (take note, lactose-intolerant folks) that is loaded with flavor.  They're not sweet -- except the sweetness of the lactose.  And they're not the least bit salty.  They taste like a great dessert in both flavor and texture.<br /><br />Thumbs way up -- licking my fingers kind of up.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

review/summary: NOT as good as the ones in the tins
review/text: Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that "oven roasted" + "honey" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.

At $2 to $2.50 per box with free s/h it's a great deal. It's getting easier to have most groceries delivered these days. Dry goods and staples and paper products. Even fruit and veggies if you like them canned or dried. You can even get milk if you like it powdered.

review/summary: The extra calories you may need
review/text: I have been a fan of Nature Valley granola bars for years. They come in many varieties. My favorites lately have been the Peanut Butter bars, but I also like the other types. So, I was pleased to learn that Amazon now offers the bars in a variety pack.<br /><br />Certainly, Oats and Honey are a classic combination. Oats go way back. Samuel Johnson included a definition of oats in his 1755 Dictionary of the English Language. Samuel Johnson said: "Oats: A grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland appears to support the people." Little did he know that two and a half centuries later, England's colonial offspring would enthusiastically endorse oats as a food for people.<br /><br />Earlier this month, I spent a week skiing in Colorado at Vail, The ticket counters were equipped with baskets of the Oats and Honey bars provided free of charge. It was a nice gesture considering the almost $100 daily ticket price. The granola bars pack 90 calories for a single bar, and obviously double that for a two-bar pack.<br /><br />I took the Oats bars with me skiing, but I also depend on them for hiking. An extra 180 calories is what you may need to give you enough energy to get up the last 180 feet to a mountain summit. The taste is good. They do not melt. If you get tired of the Oats, there is always a choice, e.g. Peanut Butter, etc., to provide variety.

review/summary: My Absolute Favorite
review/text: As a curly-haired gal, I have tried my share of products. I have a few that I've liked over the years, but this curl gel is my absolute favorite.<br /><br />Before this, I had not tried gel because I am not a fan of how crusty it can make curls look. After going through a lot of products, I had been using TIGI Curls Rock and was pretty happy with it. I decided to pick this product up on an impulse because it was so inexpensive and I am always looking for new items to try for my curls. I am glad that I did!<br /><br />I used it as directed, putting a bunch of gel into my wet hair and then drying it with a diffuser. I found that when my hair is slightly damp, twisting it around my fingers with this product makes it form more of a ringlet curl, which is a fun change. When it is dry, there is no residue or crunchy feeling at all and it holds the curl all day. The only thing is that it doesn't work as well against frizz, but I found that using the Tresemme Tres Two extra hold hairspray fought off any frizz and made sure my curls were defined.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this product again.

review/summary: TRESemme Curl Care Bouncy Curls Defining Gel, Extra Hold, 8-Ounce Bottles
review/text: I would agree with other reviewers that state this gives great definition to your curls. I would also agree that it does not help with the frizz that comes with curls, or while defusing your hair. It does give excellent hold as well. My major complaint with this product is how thick and heavy it is. I have fine hair, but I also have lots of layers. What I don't like about this product is that it tends to way my hair down alot and makes my hair look like it has less volume than it does. Also, when using this product your hair may tend to clump in some sections, so you may spend extra time seperating it to create more volume.  I don't use a diffuser because my hair tends to frizz more when using one and also my hair tends to run slightly dry, as all curly or wavy hair can. I don't want to have to use a diffuser on it and dry it out more than it already is. I would also like the product more if it addressed the frizz that naturally comes with curly and wavy hair, without having to use more products and thereby weighting it down more.Overall, I like the product alot, but I think I am going to give Garnier a try and see if it doesn't work a little bit better.

review/summary: Wonderfully smooth and great flavor, 10xs better than almond alternatives
review/text: I have been drinking this since -the- week they released it and for the last couple years, every month or so I've gotten in the habit of going to a co-op store that reliably carries it and getting a dozen (or 15 sometimes, whatever is on the shelf!) and drinking a few boxes a week (thankfully it is $2.25 a box here, 10% off when I buy<br />a case!)<br /><br />It is the absolute smoothest milk made from nuts--I am very picky and sensitive to tastes and textures (the "supertaster" test where they dye and scan your tongue? Yeah, I have 14xs the normal taste bud count and twice the depth, crazy but it makes me very aware of nuances for good and bad)... almond ones tend to have a grit; in some the salt and sugar (and cocoa in the chocolate ones) just don't ever quite join the nut blend... and no way am I drinking soy. This is PERFECT to carry with me when I am worried about temperature (so I keep a box of the 4 individuals around but actually usually take the whole 32oz one--I drink it in 3 sittings tops, usually the same day).<br /><br />Pacific foods also have amazing customer service; funny, I moved to Seattle from the east coast and having consumed it over a full year there, it suddenly was not known (the chocolate variety) ANYWHERE just a few hours from their plant in stores that have more Pacific brand broths, milks, and such than all other brands combined. They were awesome about getting it here for me (also before Amazon carried it); not sure why it costs so much with Amazon compared to a SEATTLE grocer since um Amazon is in Seattle, too, but glad for the backup regardless, hoping I never need to pay this much!<br /><br />Having had Pacific's oat, almond, hazelnut... And then Almond Breeze (the other good chocolate variety, sweetened that is, the unsweet isn't so palettable)... This is the best. The plain hazelnut milk is super smooth and great for making my own custom flavored drinks when I run out of my loved Alpenrose dairy goods (amazing milk)... This is definitely great for potential power outrages, winter storms... Great backup for perishable dairy goods! It is well worth $3/each, mind you, or grab the $28/case recurring and set it a few months away and see if you aren't hooked!! Seriously, bet you will be :) gonna go drink some right now (I should upload a shot of the cabinet shelf that is JUST 3 rows of this; 3-4 are always in the fridge cause it is so so good!)

review/summary: My favorite non-dairy "milk"
review/text: First I tried Diamond's almond milk in vanilla and unsweetened and sweetened chocolate flavors. The vanila is fine if you like almonds, I'm not wild about them. The unsweetened chocolate was undrinkable for me, and the chocolate was OK.<br /><br />Then I found the Pacific hazelnut, in plain and chocolate. I love hazelnuts. The plain in good, and the chocolate is terrific for a non-dairy milk.<br /><br />Unfortunately the three grocery stores I go to regularly don't have the hazelnut in either plain or chocolate so I am baffled where I got it. Now I will buy it from Amazon. I like that Amazon has the 8 oz. size, which I didn't know about.

I feel good about supporting this company because they believe in responsible, sustainable farming. But besides that, this milk is just delicious. Room temperature or chilled, it's equally tasty. I mixed it with coffee this morning and it's great too. I also dilute it sometimes with regular skim milk to dial down the sweetness.<br /><br />The box arrives well packaged. It's a box inside a box. The inner box is bubble-wrapped for extra protection. Unopened, the cartons do not need refrigeration and can be stored on a shelf.

review/summary: Anyone who's a Chocolate snob will never be able to do without this again...
review/text: I found this drink on a whim.  And haven't looked back since.  All the other positive reviews are TRUE!!!  This IS the BEST chocolate "milk alternative" even beyond Almond Milk.  I think Almond Milk is still relevant, because it offers a different nutritional profile than Hazelnuts, but they complement eachother.  I buy both now (Almond milk and this Hazelnut Drink) and alternate, but I gotta admit, I'm starting to become gravitated towards the Hazelnut because it just tastes so freakin awesome.  Pacific Natural Foods did a DAMN good job on this one, and they BETTER not stop this product line.  I think it's so new that it's still catching on, but like I said, all the good reviews are spot on.  You almost ask yourself "is this really good for me? it tasted just way too good to be good for me" but it IS good for you!  Hazelnuts are rich in Omegas, and this drink also has MUCH LESS sugar than most Almond Milks, and STILL tastes better.  Just try not to finish an entire carton in like 2 days, I'm not kidding...  My friend is adding it to other drink mixes too.  On the sinful side every once in a while (at night) add a dash of Kahlua to a glass, and watch out! lol

It is so rich and creamy that when I have it I just have to sit back and marvel it's not real chocolate milk.<br /><br />Chocolate and hazelnut of course is one of the best combinations known to chocolatiers on the planet- in Italy the confection is called gianduja- and this product is the liquid form of it.<br /><br />Buy, buy, buy! I will buy any of it you don't drink back from you!!!<br /><br />:)

review/summary: Danger: 5 lb puppy swallowed one in less than 10 minutes (Petite size labeled for dogs less than 11 lbs)
review/text: After reading all the great reviews for this product I was excited to try the CET HEXtra Premium Chews Petite size. The product is labeled for dogs 11 lbs and under. My Cavalier puppy weighs in at 5 lbs, so this should have been the appropriate size. My puppy went about chewing happily. I watched her chew for a few minutes, the chew was the holding up well. I answered the door, looked down and saw her swallow the chew. I tried to fish it out of her mouth but it was too late.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful to someone looking at this product. Do not believe the size guide, size up. I gave the product 2 stars because the puppy liked the taste.

review/summary: BUYER BEWARE
review/text: I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT IN THE MEDIUM SIZE FOR 11 - 25 LBS. DOGS.  THEY LOVE IT.  BUT A NUMBER OF THE PIECES ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THE REST OF THE PACKAGE AND I AM AFRAID TO GIVE THEM TO MY DOGS, FEARING THEY MIGHT SWOLLOW THEM WHOLE.<br /><br />QUALITY CONTROL SEEMS TO BE MISSING HERE AS THE PACKAGES CLAIMS ... MEDIUM  ... BUT SOME ARE VERY SMALL.  IF THIS PRODUCT WAS SOLD BY WEIGHT, RATHER THEN NUMBER OF PIECES, IT WOULD BE FAIRER TO THE CUSTOMER.<br /><br />ALSO, WHILE THE COMPANY IS LOCATED IN FORT WORTH, TEXAS, THE PACKAGE STATES "PRODUCT OF MEXICO' WHICH DISTURBS ME FOR A NUMBER OF HEALTH RELATED REASONS.

review/summary: My 12 year old dog has perfect teeth
review/text: On the advice of her vet, I have been giving her these her whole life.  She is a 5-lb dog (yes, I give her the medium size - the small size is "particle board" like rawhide, and it's not the same experience) and typically, little dogs get tooth decay and lose their teeth young in life.<br /><br />She LOVES these chews, and every vet and dog lover has been amazed at the quality of her teeth.  Should be noted, that I've read from multiple reliable sources that tooth quality in dogs affects their life span since it affects their nutrition in older age.<br /><br />I truly believe these chews have extended my dog's life - AND her quality of life.  They are worth every cent.<br /><br />(They smell like instant chicken soup, by the way)

review/summary: These are not the same as from the vet
review/text: These chews are not the same as the ones I get from the vet. Virbac adheres to strict quality control where all the chews are supposed to be the same thickness. I don't know if Amazon gets all the leftovers but the chews in these bags are all different thicknesses. Some are regular size and some are extremely thick. This is a concern for me as my dog had over $2,000 worth of dental work done and I don't want him chewing on anything too thick. These bags are cheaper than the ones I get from the vet and it shows.

review/summary: Just like at the Vet's office - Only a whole lot less $$$!
review/text: These chews are among some of my Westie's favorites so I was pleasantly surprised to be able to buy them from Amazon, and at about $8 less per package than what the Veterinarian's office charges. Glad to be able to keep a good stock on hand and bought 2 packages for only a couple of dollars more than I would have paid for one. Great product at an excellent price!
