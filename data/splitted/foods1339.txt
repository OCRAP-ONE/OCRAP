review/text: One of my favorites coffees to make at home has always been Folgers' Columbian, but this is even better. I went through it fast over the holiday season, and ran out before my subscription sent me more. In the meantime, I bought another brand at the grocery store, and was disappointed! I drink at least a couple cups of this daily, and never get sick of it.

review/text: This coffee has a decent amount of caffeine, but it's difficult even for me to drink, and I drink black coffee every day. This stuff reminds me of the icky Folgers stuff I drank every day in high school before I realized that coffee could taste good.<br /><br />Maybe it's just this flavor and not the brand, so I may consider trying another flavor in the future, though I'll probably keep trying out other brands a bit more before trying Eight O'Clock again.

review/summary: The Starbucks Antithesis!
review/text: Glad to know there are lovers of this coffee out there because that means not everyone is on board with the Starbucks 'burnt' bean flavor I so deplore. This Eight O'clock coffee is for those of us who truly love the taste of coffee--just a simple cup--either black or with a little cream. This coffee is perfectly roasted to allow the true flavor of the bean to come through. Now it probably wouldn't stand up to the heavy creams and caramel and what ever else Starbucks sells in their coffee. At any rate I'm not buying it. Give me true coffee flavor any day. This and Melitta are my favorite coffees.

I've been out for a month now and really want my 8 O'clock Columbian, which has not been schedualed to arrive for yet another month.

review/summary: Expensive and Bitter Colombian Coffee
review/text: It was suggested that the coffee I prefer tasted like "dish water" so I asked for suggestions regarding a good Colombian Ground Coffee.  I was told that Eight O'Clock Coffee, Colombian would be a great coffee. Although it was pricier than the Folger's Lively Colombian, I decided to buy it along with the Folger's and the Maxwell House Colombians and do a side-by-side taste test.  Results:  Maxwell was bold, smooth, full-bodied dark.  Folger's Lively Colombian was lighter but more complex, smooth, and "lively" and absolutely lovely.  The Eight O'Clock Colombian was dark, flat, bitter even after trying to adjust measurements.  I don't regret spending my money on this adventure and really wanted to see what it was all about. I will donate the remainder of the grounds to an organization that needs really strong coffee.  "Delicious is in the tongue of the taster." To each his own.

One out of those three bags was actually vacuum sealed and all had expiration dates within a month period. I guess the dates were the reason they were on sale but seriously, not sealed properly makes for stale coffee and is not acceptable. I complained and was refunded my money. I since have ordered several more and each time they come loose (not vacuum sealed), I'll complain to Amazon and so far they've been good about refunding my money but shouldn't they have some kind of quality control? If the bag is soft to the touch it's garbage. I guess they ship this crap out knowing few complain and they get to make money on what a grocery store would likely have to discard. Amazing to me that they'd waste their time and mine. Anyone want some free coffee to use as a deodorizer?

review/summary: Best Macadamia Nut Flavor Ever
review/text: Well I have to admit I was not as excited to try Macadamia Nut Matcha as I had been other flavors. A nut matcha to me seemed to be something one would mix with another outstanding sounding flavor, such as white chocolate mixed with macadamia nut perhaps. Alas white chocolate has not been released yet. I am sure I could have found something else to mix with this flavor but since it is my first time having it and I wanted to do a review I had it on its own.<br /><br />I can only say WOW just simply WOW. This is the most amazing macadamia nut taste! It is such a strong flavor!<br /><br />All I can say is once again I am absolutely not disappointed in Red Leaf's quality and flavors. I was so worried this flavor would only be so-so, a little nutty but not really having any true flavor unto itself. Fact is this tastes more macadamia nutty than anything else I can remember having outside of macadamia nuts themselves straight out of a can or jar, and I rarely have the nuts that way. Usually when I have macadamia nuts they are in a cookie somewhere.<br /><br />Let me just say this, if I had to choose between a couple of the cookies, and this matcha - I would pick the matcha hands down every time! And know that while I say that White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies are may all time favorite cookies!<br /><br />As always RLT's base matcha is superior to any other I have had.

review/text: I bought the 4 oz. package of this last time, and compared flavors, as I'd also found some at an International Market. (We live in California and have a big Mexican foods section.) The grocery store brand was a few bucks cheaper, but we found ourselves using more to get the same amount of flavor. Also, the grocery store brand had more of an "ashy" flavor, as opposed to a good "smokey" flavor. So I'm getting the larger package this time. We add it to a "Chipotle Potato Soup" at The New Deli, and it's a hit.

(About six halves per can.) They are perfect right out of the can, or try making upside down cake with them (instead of pineapple) adding a touch of cinnamon. Wonderful! A great Summertime lunch, too, served with reduced fat cottage cheese. We also make individual luncheon treats by adding one peach half to a half cup pyrex bowl of lemon Jello, then unmold round side up for each guest. (Garnish with fresh mint.)

review/text: Being white peaches, the flavor is muted but it is still delicious!  Each can has about ~4 whole peaches sliced in half.  They are packed in light syrup which is not great but may be necessary to preserve the terrific really ripe yet firm peach quality.  This is a great way to spice up a cake topping or ice cream or just to eat by themselves.  Roland does a great job preserving their fruit (forget their vegetables though) with all their great flavors.  The cans sit in your cabinet waiting for when you need them, not for when they sit rotting in your refrigerator because you did not use them within their limited time span.  I will be buying these again......they truly are delicious!

review/summary: delicate, sweet flavor
review/text: I bought a box of these canned white peach halves because they were on sale with a very good discount, and because the chances of ever finding fresh white peaches (which I understand don't ship or keep well at all) in my local farmer's market is next to nil, so this seemed like my best chance to try this fruit.  As others have noted, these peach halves are packed in syrup, rather than juice, which is not normally my preference, but otherwise I have no complaints at all.<br /><br />The white peaches seem to have a much more delicate flavor than the robust yellow peaches we're all more used to, but they're a lovely appetizer or dessert on their own.<br /><br />I will confess, though, that my favorite way to serve these has been to empty an entire can (syrup and all) into a covered glass bowl, toss in a handful of frozen red raspberries, and let them sit in the refrigerator together for an hour or a day until I'm ready to serve them for dessert.  The raspberry flavor nicely complements the white peach flavor, and the peach halves and their syrup take on a gorgeous range of dark pink to lavender to plum shades of purple.  Tasty AND pretty to eat (and even with the syrup, still more nutritious than most desserts of comparable appeal, I'd argue).<br /><br />And if you warmed the white peach and raspberry combo slightly and served it with scoops of vanilla ice cream, you could call it a lazy cook's version of Peach Melba.  But I think the ice cream is unnecessary, myself, and enjoy a cold dessert that requires no cooking whatsoever, now that daytime temperatures are back in the upper 80's.

review/summary: !! NASTY !!
review/text: White peaches are my favorite during the summer!<br />I love canned peaches during the winter, usually.  This brand of fruit was the most DISGUSTING I have ever had the misfortune to attempt to eat.<br /><br />As soon as my shipment arrived I opened a can and poured it into a bowl. So far so good.  Then me and my daughter ate some. We both looked at each other with an odd look. Ok, maybe the first bite is a little off. So I try another bite, yuck.<br /><br />I checked the side of another can to see why these peaches would taste so funny.  The ingredients state:  white peach halves, water, sugar. Packed exclusively for American Roland food Corp.  New York, NY 10010.  Product of China<br /><br />Peaches, water, and sugar can't possibly taste this nasty!  The texture of the liquid has an unusual viscosity to it for light syrup. This produces an odd mouth feel after the second bite, can't exactly explain it.  Something is just off.<br /><br />Based on the other reviews that are favorable I will give the rest of the box (11 more cans left) to the next can food collection, maybe someone else will enjoy them.<br /><br />My review:  YUCK, NASTY!

review/summary: I cannot even fathom this product
review/text: When the package from Del Monte showed up at my door, I immediately jumped off the couch and was like, "Oh to the yes". When I took them out of the cans, the kraut was fresh as if it had been pickled and canned that very morning. Everyone thought it was amazing: my wife, my kids, my dog, and especially myself. I would definitely order this again and will tell all my friends to do the same in an email, beginning, right, now.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because when I was struggling to open the package the cardboard gave me a pretty bad cut on my left thumb. Del Monte should look into cutting down on the excessive packaging of their canned vegetables - they are already in aluminum cans, you can just put them in a paper bag. That would be better for the earth, too.

review/summary: Not sure that there is actually tea in this product
review/text: I should have paid more attention to the photos of this product when purchasing it.. I thought it looked like it was red-ish brown..but it is truly as red as Kool-aid and tastes completely unlike tea to me - it was most like unsweetened Kool-aid in my opinion.<br /><br />I'm an avid iced tea drinker - I drink it year 'round and a pitcher of tea is always at the ready in our fridge. I tried this tea to see if it would be a nice one to add to my rotation (I like Paradise Iced Tea and China Mist Mango & Passion Fruit ice teas). It was so horrible tasting I couldn't drink it. It doesn't taste like Mango at all - it tastes vaguely of herbal hibiscus and rose - it doesn't taste fruity at all.<br /><br />I plan to give it away to someone who likes herbal teas -- because I'm quite certain it lacks any black tea (or any tea at all?)..and therefore wouldn't be useful to me (I like caffeine in my tea).

review/text: This was on sale at the local grocery store so I thought I'd give it a try.  Its absolutely horrible.  I am not a picky eater, I'll eat almost anything.  After a few bites of this, I threw it in the trash.  I hate the thought of wasting food, but this is vomit in a jar.  I was fooled by the fancy label, and the Newmans Own brand usually being quality.  What really offended me was the vomit smell upon opening the jar, and then the vomit taste when I dipped my tortilla chip in the toxic goo.  Like I said, I hate wasting food, so I thought I would tough it out and force myself to eat some more.  A few bites later, I was violently throwing the jar in my garbage.  I was forced to snack on plain tortilla chips, how boring.  This product should be banished from existence. What infuriates me is the part of the label that says "so good it oughta be outlawed".  An outright lie sir!  How about a new label that says "so vomitey you'll think you ate your own vomit", and Newmans face green and frowning.

review/summary: My Terriers Actually Like This Stuff
review/text: The "Dynamic Duo," (a male Westie and a female Scotty), have been eating Blue Buffalo's Adult Weight Control Chicken and Brown Rice kibble for more than two years. Well, to be entirely honest, they eat equal parts of Blue Buffalo and Natural Ultramix, supplemented with fresh boiled chicken, peas, carrots, and apples - and an occasional can of Halo or Evanger's. So why do we include the Blue Buffalo?<br /><br />First, because it is made from the best ingredients - if you were going to make the stuff yourself, besides chicken, you'd probably include grains like brown rice, barley, oats and rye, (no wheat, corn or soy), and vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes, carrots and sweet potatatoes, not to mention a few extras like blueberries, cranberries and, (I swear), green tea extract.<br /><br />Second, because they actually like it. And if you've got a finicky dog, you know what I'm talkin' about. Our Scotty will eat almost anything, (delicacy prevents me from going into any detail on this point), but our Westie? This is a dog for whom every bite is a thoughtfully considered proposition. Should I eat this? Hmmmmmm? Maybe not. Perhaps I should move it from my bowl to the living room carpet and contemplate it? Ah.... It's Blue Buffalo. I'll eat it.<br /><br />We generally buy the 6 pound bag - that means that we buy more frequently than we would if we were buying the larger sizes - but it's easier to store and stays fresher.<br /><br />Many people are concerned about feeding their dogs "dry" food - and to some extent, I share that concern. But when it's a quality product like Blue Buffalo and is fed as part of a "menu" that includes other fresh and healthy "entrees," I think that it's an excellent addition to your dog's diet.<br /><br />[This is an up-date to my review: Economic times being what they are, something had to give - so a couple of months ago, we eliminated the Natural Ultramix from our terriers' diets. We also eliminated the canned foods, (my wife is convinced that even a small amount of canned food was contributing to our Scotty's tendency to put on a little extra weight). So we've been feeding them Blue Buffalo exclusively, supplemented with fresh boiled chicken, peas, carrots and apples. This change has had no ill effects on their health or appearence - and they continue to love the stuff. I remain convinced that when it comes to kibble, Blue Buffalo is an outstanding product.]

They don't come with a twist off cap like in the picture, you open them like a regular old paper drink carton. Also there are only 3 flavors, strawberry, blueberry and orange. no apple as is pictured. The flavor is amazing. If you like gummies, that's kind of what the texture is like.

I assumed there would be 3 of each or the 4 flavors. Instead it was 2 blueberry, 5 Strawberry and 5 Orange (1.5 oz. cartons)<br />The packaging didn't display anything about an apple flavor, so my conclusion is that the picture listed is out of date and needs to be updated.<br />Not that i don't love them all! but the blueberry ones are pretty much the best and its sad that i only have 2. i was also eager to try the apple flavor. its the only kind i had yet to sample. (they must not make them anymore, I've never seen them anywhere else)

review/text: I've looked for these everywhere recently (WalMart, Target, Publix) and could not find them in stores.  I decided to go ahead and order them even though people were giving mixed reviews on the flavors they were getting.  In our package I received 1 Orange, 3 Blueberry, 5 Strawberry, & 3 Apple . . . yes Apple! I was surprised to see it since most said they didn't get apple but we did.  It's unfortunate that they can't stock the packages evenly with 3 of each flavor but it was well worth the price.  No screw off lid like others had said but that wasn't a huge selling point for me either.  Prices were much better than on the actual Florida's Natural website where they were $0.99 for each 1.5oz carton and they only offered orange, blueberry, & strawberry.  Plus I got free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime so my daughter & I are already enjoying them!

review/text: I love these fruit nuggets! They are a great snack and super tasty. The only issue I had was that there were not as many Orange ones as I would have wanted. There are a ton of Strawberry nuggets, lots of Blueberry, a few Apple, and only two Orange packages. But it still gets 5 stars because it doesn't effect their taste.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: These are so good and I cant find them in bulk anywhere!  Shipping was fast and item arrived safe and sound.  As other reviewers have mentioned they are not quite as pictured.  There were 5 orange, 5 strawberry, and 2 blueberry in my pack and they looked like mini milk containers (no cap).  The individual cartons measure 1.5in by 1.5in by 3.75in.  They are FULL however, there are a lot of nuggets in each container!  They taste like fruit juice...because that's what they're made of :)  And they do have a "waxy" coating on the outside of them which I guess some people didn't like, but I actually like it because they don't get sticky in your hand.  The consistency is not like gummy bears, it's like mike and ikes, but smaller.

review/summary: Less Tasty Than Expected.
review/text: Like other reviewers, I found the ratio of flavors to be unpredictable. Given the variety, it doesn't even seem to be worth mentioning. Perhaps it changes as different fruit comes in season or there is a surplus in crops.<br /><br />You should notice the size. They are very appropriate for a small snack.<br /><br />Mine tasted very artificial. I think it was the coating on the outside, which is probably meant to protect the freshness of the filling. The orange once especially tasted like they were from fruit that was not exceptionally ripe. The overall result was rather disappointing.

review/summary: Not an even mix of flavors!
review/text: I was excited to get these but was bummed when I discovered there was only 1 orange, 3 blueberry, 3 apple, and 5 strawberry and of course orange happens to be our favorite flavor. After getting them I read other reviews and see that the flavors combinations must be random. Besides the flavor distribution this product is really good. I like that the cartons can be folded back shut since there is a good amount in each carton, however it doesn't come with the screw cap as shown in the picture.  I will buy these again but wish you could choose what flavor or at least know what flavors you would be getting.

review/summary: Good... But...
review/text: These fruit snacks are pretty good.  They are small squares that are hard/sugary on the outside and gummy inside.  The cartons also contain quite a but - probably more than you should eat at one time.  However, we ordered these specific fruit snacks because it is hard to find orange flavored ones, and I assumed each back would have 4 flavors, 3 of each.  That was not the case.  We received two boxes that only had ONE carton of orange fruit snacks.  So, that was disappointing and we ended up cancelling our subscription...  But, overall, they were pretty tasty.

review/summary: Odd taste, contains Corn Syrup and is Made in CHINA!
review/text: The best part about this product is that it is made from American-grown fruit...other than this, it is disappointing.  First, the containers aren't exactly as pictured (no round screw-on cap, just a carton), which was only important to my son.  Secondly, the containers are very small (only 4 inches tall), so the entire pack hardly seems worth the cost.  As for the taste, the nuggets are very sweet, and I was sick of them before the container was empty.  Finally, if you're trying to avoid corn syrup, don't buy this product, as it contains corn syrup (and extra sugar).  Overall, I was disappointed by this odd product by a quality company.  We're switching back to Cliff Kid fruit twists.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />While the front of the cartons state "Made from American Grown Fruits" the bottom of the carton reads "Made responsibly in CHINA"!!  Seriously?  They grow the fruit in the US, ship it to China for processing, and ship it back to the US to be sold to consumers?<br /><br />Shame on Florida's Natural for their deceitful advertising.  In my opinion, people concerned about buying products made/grown in the USA do NOT want these products processed in China.  Way to support the American economy, Florida's Natural.

If you start going through your panty's you will find corn syrup in the majority of things in there- from<br />breads to cereals to juice drinks. Corn syrup is a contributing factor to diabetes and obesity. There are fruit snacks (annies bunnies) that are all natural and will assure better<br />health. The corn syrup distributers/manufacturerers want you to believe our bodies process sugar the same as corn syrup; that is just not true.

review/summary: Kitty likes the shredded chicken and real chunks of salmon
review/text: Our cat is a picky eater.  She refuses to eat pate-style canned food.  This does not leave us with many options.  Weruva and Tiki Cat both provide foods with shredded chicken meat and/or chunks of fish.  Kitty prefers the Tiki Cat chicken flavors to the Weruva chicken (which she often barfs), and the Weruva fish flavors to the Tiki Cat fish flavors.<br /><br />Our previous vet recommended incorporating wet food into her diet - she was getting chubby on dry food alone. However, our current vet noted that Tiki Cat is high in carbohydrates and fat.

review/summary: A solid entry to the GoPicnic lineup: vegan, gluten-free, and nut-free
review/text: If you've already tried GoPicnic meals before, you know basically what to expect here: a main dish, a couple of side items, and a dessert.<br /><br />While all GoPicnic meals are gluten-free, this meal is designed to avoid SEVEN types of allergens: wheat, dairy, fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, and eggs. It's also completely vegan. Just about anyone should be able to eat each of the included components of the meal.<br /><br />The main dish is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OK6E6I">SunButter Creamy Sunflower Seed Spread</a> with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YJBLMM">Crunchmaster Multi-Grain Crackers</a>.<br /><br />The sunbutter is pretty interesting- you have to sort of knead it before opening the package to make sure it's nice and mixed and pliable. It tastes a lot like peanut butter and is similarly sticky. The texture is more on the smooth side than the crunchy side. The crackers are pretty good- they're crisp and have a mild, subtle flavor.<br /><br />The side dishes are a seed-and-fruit trail mix and a fruit snack.<br /><br />The trail mix is really good- it's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK88IA">Mountain Mambo Nut Free Trail Mix, Gluten, Dairy & Nut Free</a>, the main ingredients of which are pre-shelled sunflower seeds and bits of dried fruit (raisin and apple). My only complaint is that there's only 0.75oz of it, so it goes really quickly. The fruit snack is Niagara Natural Simply Fruit Tropical Bites (no Amazon link, sorry). They're shaped like little pellets or logs and have a flavor and texture that vaguely reminded me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMOCPI">Fruit Roll-Ups</a>. They're mostly made of apple-based ingredients, but a few other fruit juices are also included.<br /><br />The dessert is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SET0ZA">Enjoy Life Double chocolate Crunchy Cookie)</a>. The cookie is definitely crunchy! I was surprised when I bit into it, though not really in a bad way. The flavor was okay, but honestly, I'd have preferred a little square of real chocolate like you get in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBP6Q0">GoPicnic Hummus + Crackers</a> meal.<br /><br />One thing to note, though, is that this all ends up being a little light on protein. This meal has 12g, versus 25g for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBP6Q0">GoPicnic Hummus + Crackers</a>. Also, a word of warning: although the meal is pretty healthy, it doesn't skimp on the fat. This little box crams in 26 total grams of fat.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />Pros: Gluten-free and nut-free; even picky eaters should enjoy every item; high in fiber and low in sodium<br />Cons: Not very filling; flavors, while good, aren't very exciting or varied; dessert is good, but not great; fat content is surprisingly high<br /><br />(If this review was helpful for you, please choose "Yes" below!)

review/summary: Almost great
review/text: I was torn between 3 and 4 stars but after reading my own review I went down to 3.  But I still would recommend this, especially for people like me that have so many limits to what they can eat...  I am limited in what I can eat.  I cannot eat sulfites, dairy, wheat or refined/cane sugar and this meal almost gets it 100% for me.  The trail mix is all sulfite free and even says so on the package which was awesome.  I could have done without the little tiny chocolate chips in the trail mix but after picking the chocolate chips out I really enjoyed it.  The cookie was the only thing I could not eat.  An improvement for me would be to have it sweetened with beet sugar or agave.  I was suprised at how small the meal was and there was not enough sunbutter for the crackers.  The other thing about the sunbutter is that it says on the package you can squeeze the sunbutter out but when I did I got an ooze of oil (like the kind that sits on top of some peanut butter) yuck.  But on the positive note...the sunbutter was great tasting, much better than expected.  The crackers were great, little fruit snacks were great and 100 fruit juice sweetened.  So everything I ate from this meal was 4 stars.  I am a mom of 2 girls and I think my three year old will like this, I will bring it flying with us in a couple of weeks.  All in all it was a great snack but not a meal for me.

review/summary: Great option for those with multiple food allergies
review/text: I'm a parent of two kids with multiple food allergies.  GoPicnic meals have been stocked for some time at one of our local stores and I have bemoaned the fact that they ALL contained nutes, dairy, and other common allergens.  I was very excited to find this option.  Because each component of the meal is individually pre-packaged and the source companies themselves are very cross-contamination savvy, I was not too concerned about cross-contamination from the facility where the meals are assembled.  Unfortunately my kids were not huge fans of many of the components of this meal.  They ended up opening all the boxes and picking out the one or two things they each liked (the fruit snacks were the biggest hit, and the trail mix got thumbs-up as well), leaving the rest for me and my non-food-allergic child to enjoy.  There was also a little bonus Soduku puzzle in the bottom of the box which was a nice feature I didn't expect and the kids enjoyed.  I hope that GoPicnic will continue to pursue allergy-friendly meal options - maybe the next combo will be a bigger hit with my particular kids.  Overall, I think this is a great option for those with food allergies for a quick on-the-go meal or snack.

review/text: I purchased both the sunbutter and hummus packs when I was looking for some lunch options for work. I wasn't doing a good job of remembering to pack my lunch and where I work, there are very few vegetarian let alone vegan lunch options. (How many times can you have cheese pizza or PBJ?) These packs are so handy and yummy. They do contain processed foods, but I'm okay with that given the quality and the convenience. Though they are small, they are filling. Both my husband and I usually have one or two items left over for an afternoon snack. I hope that gopicnic adds even more vegetarian/vegan options.

review/summary: Expensive but Convenient
review/text: With my son's nut allergy, I'm always on the lookout for safe snacks.  We get a little tired of rice krispie treats & goldfish around here!<br />These were pretty pricey for the amount of food contained, but for a pre-packaged safe snack we thought we'd give them a try.<br />Basically, like other reviewers, my son picked out the pieces he liked & now I have a pantry full of leftover bits from these.<br />He liked the fruit snacks, but we can find peanut-safe fruit snacks fairly easily in the grocery store.<br />He also liked the chocolate cookie, but it's pretty hard & crumbly.<br />We both liked the trail mix enough to go hunt it down & buy it with subscribe & save here on Amazon.  The flavor included is mountain mambo, which we LOVE.  We also bought bags of the other flavor, beach bash, which is sweeter, with dried pineapple but no chocolate chips (my son loved the little chocolate chips in the mountain mambo).<br />The crackers & sunbutter were left over.<br />I think sunbutter is great - sweeter than soybutter & tastes more like real peanut butter to me, but my son is so used to soybutter that he wants nothing to do with the sunbutter packet (which was the main reason we bought these - to have portable small portions of sunbutter).<br />I occasionally will eat the sunbutter on the crackers, but the crackers are tough - not very kid-friendly.<br />Overall I think it's a handy snack if you're going hiking or camping, but probably won't work for us.  We might use the parts for a roadtrip or everyday snack, but it really costs too much to pick apart like we did.

review/summary: Great crunch, great taste
review/text: These Ritz Toasted Chips are awesome. I love the freshness of them. They are satisfyingly crunchy and have a great flavor. Decidedly more healthy than potato chips since they have significantly less fat. They're also made from soybean oil so you get some of the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><br />They hold up well in dip, unlike most potato chips that usually end up breaking in the dip. Also when dipping into something like salsa, these have no problem scooping up the salsa without becoming soggy.<br /><br />They are obviously a snack food so calories are something to keep an eye on... these are 130 calories per 13 chips (approx) and the 8.1oz bag contains 8 servings. Sodium is 250mg per serving, probably fairly typical or maybe a little lower than some other similar snack products. I could do with a little less salt personally. But I don't think it's excessive for this type of product. Hey, if you want totally healthy, you should be eating carrots, not toasted chips :-)<br /><br />There are one of my new favorites for snacks and I rate them a solid 5 stars.

review/summary: Not Tea Bags
review/text: Although I do like this product, and am happy with it, I was surprised to find that they are not tea bags.  Instead, they are individual serving size packets of crystals that dissolve in water (hence being "instant"). Contains a lactose base.

review/summary: All hail to those little Tasmanian bees!
review/text: This is the best honey ever!  I used to get it years ago in New York, but had not had any for a very long time.  This winter, with all the talk about the effectiveness of cough remedies,  I read about honey being a good alternative to cough syrup. My husband had a nagging one, so  I thought why not get him the best!  Who knows about the cough part, but it is just great, great honey!  We absolutely love this honey!  So glad I found it again on Amazon!

review/summary: "The bees' knees"
review/text: Phenomenal honey...many/most honeys are good (tupelo, alpine, raw clover, etc.), but Leatherwood Honey is THE BEST! Simply a must-try. You will love it...guaranteed. If you can't go to Tasmania, this honey is a very close second!
