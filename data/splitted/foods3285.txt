review/summary: Novus teas are fabulous !
review/text: Novus teas are quickly becoming one of my favorites.  I have purchased several of them, including the sampler box which allowed me to try 12 different varieities.  This one in particular stands out.<br /><br />I am typically not someone who enjoyes citrus -- it just is too tangy for my taste buds, however this tea is great!  It is mild in the lemon flavor and to use dessert analogy, it's more like drinking a lemon pound cake versus a lemon tart.<br /><br />Loose-leaf teas are usually superior to the crushed tea leaves in regular tea bags, but I often am impatient to deal with all the mess.  These are packed with loose-leaf tea in a mesh pyramid which allows for the benefits of the loose tea without having to clean out a teapot with the soggy leaves.  Each pyramid contains enough tea leaves for a small teapot, not just a single cup and are individually sealed for freshness.<br /><br />If you enjoy lemon chamomile tea, be sure to give this one a try.  It's great !!

review/summary: Great Tasting
review/text: I bought a box of these as a special.  Sure glad I bought when I did as the price went up drastically.  I love raspberries and wanted to try dark chocolate over milk chocolate.  These taste excellent!  I consider them a treat after dinner as if I was eating one of those very expensive chocolates but for much less the cost.  They are small enough that I don't feel like I am packing away pounds by eating one or two yet are very flavorful in a small candy.<br /><br />I would buy again but having 430 of them I have enough for awhile.  Will probably take some to work to share with the group.

review/summary: delicious...packaging not so great
review/text: Of course this candy is delicious, which is the reason I ordered it.  I already knew what I was getting.  The only thing that bothered me was that it came in a plastic bag that was not even sealed.  I also ordered green candies but these were packaged in the original boxes and sealed.  Although the description says unwrapped it should be more specific, because they also sell these candies individually wrapped so I assumed it simply meant they were not individually wrapped.  I would at least expect the plastic to be sealed.  Otherwise everything was yummy and definitely worth the money.

review/summary: Really thick but good product
review/text: I bought this product with hesitation after the last reviewer mentioned the odd consistency but I can honestly say I had no problems whatsoever.  It is a good product, comes with the pump and is probably as good as you get from the major coffee shops.  It is really thick but I chalk that up to it being real vanilla and not synthetic.  I am 1/3 through the bottle and will probably buy again.

review/summary: Excellent Flavor. Odd Consistency.
review/text: The flavor of the syrup is excellent. It has a strong, natural vanilla flavor without being overly sweet. It adds a nice compliment to my espresso drinks.<br /><br />However, the consistency of the syrup is why I am giving it three stars. The syrup in the bottle I received is partially crystallized (like a bottle of old honey gets). It is so thick that it clogs the pump sometimes and it is hard to get the syrup to dissolve in my coffee. I don't know if this is only a problem with the bottle I received or the vanilla syrup in general because the Amoretti Butterscotch syrup I ordered at the same time is excellent and doesn't have any of these problems.<br /><br />UPDATE: Changed to 4 stars. Amoretti has some of the best customer service that I have come across. A couple days after posting this review, I got a call from a representative of Amoretti. He explained that the reason the syrup is thicker than I was expecting is because they use real vanilla beans in the syrup. The pieces of vanilla bean can make the syrup thicken.<br /><br />Amoretti clearly cares about customer satisfaction and takes pride in their products. They offered to send me another flavor of syrup, which, like their butterscotch syrup, is smooth and delicious.<br /><br />As I mentioned in the original review, the flavors of all the syrups I have tried from Amoretti have been excellent. You just have to be prepared for some of their syrups to be a little thicker than some other brands. Now that I know why the syrup is thicker, I will be buying from them again.

review/text: Another reviewer seems to have missed a point that is so important to those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.  This is from the Bear Naked product description:  "Packaged in a facility that processes wheat, nuts, soy and dairy."  Bakery on Main is gluten free, and in my opinion is quite delicious.  So for those who must avoid all traces of gluten, and want to choose a product that isn't processed at a facility that also processes wheat, rest assured that you are buying a delicious product with Bakery on Main products.  I discovered their products at Life Grocery in Marietta, GA, a few months ago, and I've been hooked ever since.  I don't care for the apple variety, but the others are great.

review/text: This is a tasty product, unlike some of the gluten-free foods that I have tried.  It is very crunchy with lots of fruit and nuts.  It has plenty of calories, but I use it as a topping for other, less-tasty cereals, e.g. bran flakes or some of the high-fiber cereals that remind me of twigs and leaves.  I will definitely be ordering more in the future.

review/summary: My favorite gluten-free cereal - full of flavor and crunch!
review/text: I've been eating gluten-free for almost two years now. One of my favorite breakfasts used to be a bowl of cereal with a handful of almonds and a container of yogurt. I picked up a bag of Bakery on Main Extreme Fruit & Nut Granola at the store one day, and I was hooked! As the name says, it's loaded with fruit and nuts. There is a good mixture of large, crunchy chips and flakes, seeds, and little crunchy nuggets. I signed up for the auto-ship service on Amazon, and get a shipment of 6 bags every 4 months. With the free shipping, it comes out significantly less than buying it a bag at a time at the grocery store.<br /><br />Gluten-free breakfast doesn't have to be boring... Thank you, Bakery On Main!

The shelf life is good, so buying in bulk is no problem.  I have introduced the Granola to my friends who now also buy in bulk.  Give it a try and you'll never stop buying it.

review/text: I have been purchasing Bakery On Main Extreme Fruit & Nut Gluten Free Granola for several years.  I do not have a gluten allergy, I was just looking for something besides the usual granola or cereal and I found it.  Unlike the usual granola, there are no dry oatmeal flakes, or oversweet dates in this.  This particular flavor contains whole toasted almonds and some dried fruit and something that resembles a cornflake with grape nuts in it, but with alot more flavor.  My only negative comment is that it contains whole flax seed, not ground, which is not digested.

review/summary: Fairly tasty gluten-free cereal, perhaps a little too sweet
review/text: Gluten-free replacements can taste disgusting, but this cereal is better than most. A little too sweet, it stays crunchy for a long time in milk. It's loaded with nuts and dried fruit, but it has that slightly-off corn flavor that I am not a huge fan of. And at $6 a bag, I can't justify buying it when Trader Joe's sells a gluten-free cereal using the exact same ingredients in the exact same order (probably made for them by Bakery on Main) for $3.49 a bag. I am not knocking the product; it's really tasty sprinkled on Greek yogurt, which cuts down on the cloying sweetness a bit, but it's even more overpriced than most cereals.<br /><br />A far better tasting gluten-free granola is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003E3WMM4">Udi's Gluten Free Granola</a>. The Original and Cranberry are outstanding with lots of chewy fruit and crunch.

review/text: Bakery on Main does well with their Apple walnut granola as well as there cranberry granola. I would give both of those 4 stars (excluding the price frusterations) but the extreme fruit and nut isn't any good. Tastes gross to me. They need to totally change this recipe.

review/text: A friend recommended this tea, saying that it basically knocked her out at bedtime. I have two small kids so that really isn't a problem, but I liked the idea of a nice relaxing tea to enjoy during a little quiet time at night.<br /><br />This tea is wonderful. I brewed it up, enjoying the vapors, then drank it in a leisurely fashion (while watching "Scrubs", but that's neither here nor there). It is very tasty. My cat wanted to eat the teabag in a big way, which was charming. Then she climbed up on my lap to smell my breath, which was just adorable.<br /><br />I didn't doze off on the couch, which I half-expected based on what my friend had said, but I was verrrry melllooooooow. In a good way. A very good way.<br /><br />If you love tea but can't drink the caffeinated stuff at night, try this. It is yum.

review/text: Sweet Dreams does not get me drowsy like some people may say.  But the taste for some reason and the smoothness, mildness of it seems perfect for a before bed drink.  Even the purple color it makes just looks like a relaxant.  Good to help you clear your mind before bed.  Again, I'm not saying it will, so don't depend on it.  It's just one of the best drinks to add to your bed time routine.  Don't drink it during the day, because it might make you lose your psychological association with sleep because that's all it really is.

My grocery store was out the last time I went so I picked up Bigelow Sweet Dreams instead. He loves it just as much as his beloved Sleepy Time. Just a side note, Bigelow also makes a wonderful Earl Grey. Just because something is cheap in price does not mean it is cheap in taste. I drink all kinds of teas, bagged and loose leaf, and Bigelow can surely run with the big dogs so to speak.

But I wanted to find something that would keep me from taking them every night.. This tea does mellow me out to where I can relax enough that I do not have to take as much of the sleep meds. I drink a cup in the evening and I can sit back and watch the world pass me by with less stressing. If you want a good tasting tea that is a great relaxer this is the ticket and at a great price.

I've always had a problem falling asleep, so he had me try Sweet Dreams Herbal Tea.  Well, I don't like chamomile and I hate mint tea, but this one is so mild and has a soothing fragrance, it has me addicted.  Of course, I add a splash of half & half to it, and that makes it creamy as well. Back to the whole point, it actually helps to make you sleepy.  I asked my husband  to try it, and he was surprised it really worked for him. So I buy it by the 6 box case now, because it is more economical. Good stuff!

Had myself a cup of Sweet Dreams Tea and along with just relaxing by reading or doing a puzzle from a book, it has helped me to go back to sleep.  Usually when I have woke up in the middle of the night, also having RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome), I take my medication, have myself a cup of Sweet Dreams Tea, and am usually up for probably no more than one hour and back to bed and to sleep I go.  Has a very good taste as well.  I always keep a box in the cupboard. Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy.

review/text: [...] bucks for 120 tea bags. not bad. One thing about sweet dreams (for me at least) is that the tea doesnt really do much, except taste good. I dont really get mellow, tired, at all after drinking this tea. Real chamomile tea taste bad and literally smells, so Im glad that this version with mint drowns out the taste. Thats all I can really say about this tea, it tastes good but does not help or provide a better night sleep. Probably because I have insomnia, but I think the whole sweet dreams is a placebo, people see it like me and think "oh this will put me to sleep" when in reality you are just putting yourself to sleep by thinking the product will knock you out. Just my opinion though, if it works for you then good for you.

review/summary: Ordinary Lifestyle For The Peanut-Allergic
review/text: My kids with multiple food allergies (including peanuts) already have enough on their plate without having to explain why they're eating weird looking stuff.  So I am thrilled to be able to recommend Sunbutter as a peanut butter substitute.  My kids don't have to do without that childhood lunch staple, the peanut-butter sandwich.<br /><br />Sunbutter doesn't taste like peanut butter; it tastes like sunflower seeds.  However, this is not an unpleasant taste, just different.  It has the exact same texture and mouth-feel as peanut butter, though, so it can be used as a straight substitute for peanut butter in all kinds of recipes.  We've used it as a substitute to make peanut-free peanut sauce, peanut butter cookies, and peanut butter fudge.  It functions exactly as peanut butter does, and as long as the sunflower-seed taste goes well in the recipe, it does just fine.  I should warn you, though, there are some contexts where the flavor just doesn't work with the recipe.  On the other hand you may find that some people will prefer the flavor.  Our neighbors don't have a single peanut-allergic kid, but they bought some Sunbutter anyway because their kids had it over at our peanut-free house and loved it.<br /><br />Sunbutter does have a couple of quirks.  First, if you expose it to alkali, it turns green.  So if you use it in a recipe that is heavy on the baking soda, you may get an unexpected result.  And of course since detergent is alkali, if you leave any on the knife and put it in the dishwasher, that which doesn't wash off will be a harmless but very ugly fecal shade of green.  Rinse thoroughly before putting Sunbutter-covered utensils in the dishwasher.  Second, it has more of a tendency than peanut butter to separate into oil and solids.  I used to buy it in the large tubs but when we'd open one up there was an inch-thick layer of sunflower oil on the top.  We tried to mix it in but then we found that the stuff at the bottom was so thick and dry that it couldn't be spreaded at all.  We developed two workarounds for this: one, upon opening a new container, we'd dump it in the mixer and mix it all up.  Two, buy smaller jars.<br /><br />Overall, three cheers for Sunbutter!

review/summary: Peanut Free Heaven
review/text: I am an adult who has been allergic to peanuts since childhood. I have never eaten peanut butter, but have always been envious of the idea of peanut butter...a quick, tasty, healthful food that goes with a multitude of other things and is found in recipes everywhere. Unfortunately, since peanuts = death for me, I put it out of my mind. Then one day I found this Sunbutter. Not only is it peanut and tree nut free, it explicitly states on the label that it is manufactured in a facilty that is peanut and nut free. A good thing, because it was with fear and trepidation that I opened and then tasted sunbutter...I mean, it looks and smells just like peanut butter. Obviously, I can't say if it tastes like peanut butter, but I can say that it is DELICIOUS! I have been gleefully eating it on crackers, with apple slices, on sandwiches, and out of the jar straight. It is a major food discovery for me, and I am oh so thankful.

review/text: I accidentally purchased this product, thinking it was the Natural SunButter I usually buy in the store.  I thought the red cap looked different (the Natural has a yellow cap), but couldn't pinpoint what was different.  I quickly realized after reading the ingredients (sugar, mono-diglycerides) and tasting the product (YUCK!) that is was different.  It was harder in texture than the Natural SunButter because the mono-diglycerides prevent separation, and the taste was so bland and fake-tasting compared to the Natural SunButter. Don't get confused.  Buy the Natural SunButter with the yellow cap.  Same company, different (and better) product altogether.

Hiss!  )o=  I'm out 26.00!  (there was no mention of these in the description)<br /><br />Here's what my research found read my copy paste below...<br /><br />Mono-Diglycerides<br />Just a New Name to Disquise An Old Silent Killer - Hydrogenated Oils<br /><br />First, let me make it clear, mono-diglycerides are nothing more than hydrogenated oils. There are those that will say I do not know what I am talking about concerning this new name the food industry is using for hydrogenated oils, but let me assure you, mono-diglycerides are hydrogenated before separated into mono-diglyceridies. The "mono" means they are a combination of various oils mixed together, hydrogenated, then certain fatty acids called diglycerides are then separated out. It is truly amazing how many people when confronted with the truth will still try to convince others the opposite of the truth.<br /><br />Mono-diglycerides remain the most widely used emulsifiers in food production. They are called mono-digylcerides because they are made from oils that have a high mono saturated fat content, but they are still hydrogenated. These are used in a wide variety of food manufacturing such as, breads, bagels, muffins, cookies, cakes, pies, donuts, pasta mixes, potato chips, ice creams, almost all packaged desserts, nearly all margarines and other spreads. Your local grocery bakery including Walmart bakeries use these oils. New margarine spreads Benecol(tm) and Take Control(tm) contain hydrogenated oils . Just read your label. Remember...its' your health!<br /><br />There are many food oil companies that produce mono-diglyerides. So when you read mono-diglycerides on packaged foods, it is nothing more than hydrogented oils. Below is a sample of one product listings from Gillco, oils manufactured by Quest International, one of the largest food oil producing companies worldwide. Gillco's url address is [...]. They sell mono-diglycerides using these names, Myverol�, Myvacet�, Myvatex�, Myvaplex� and they stipulate on the company's fact sheet that they are "hydrogenated".<br /><br />*****I'm not going to eat this...but I'm not condemning anyone else that does...Skippy Natural Peanut Butter is safer in my opinion. But that's just my opinion!~ (=

review/summary: SunButter vs. Trader Joes - its the SAME
review/text: With a peanut allergy at home I was hard pressed to find a safe alternative. I was ecstatic when I found Sunflower Seed Butter at my local Tradrer Joes. Since my daughter's school is peanut free I started sending her to school with Sunflower Seed Butter.  However, since it looked and smelled so much like peanut butter, the school wanted me to provide proof that the sunbutter I was sending in was indeed peanut safe.  After much investigation and a few phone calls, I did determine that the Sunflower Seed Butter you can buy at TJs is in fact manufactured by Sunbutter! So it is peanut safe, etc - Unfortunately, for me the TJs brand just upped their price on SB from 399 to 499. When you are buying it in large quantities this price increase makes a siginificant dent in one's wallet. Bottom line, buying SB from amazon is now a better deal. However, since SunButter does make different versions of its product (creamy, no stir, organic, natural, etc) - I am not sure which version is an exact swap with TJs.

review/text: When my son was first diagnosed with a nut allergy we stopped using any kind of nuts in the house at all.  Peanut butter being my favorite thing this was a major blow to me.  People told us to try soy-nut butter or whatever.  YUCK.  We saw SunButter initially at our local grocery store and bought it.  BLISS.  Peanut butter lovers REJOICE.  We ate the SunButter natural for a few years which was fine but kind of runny and you need to mix it.  Just recently we bought this Creamy SunButter and folks let me tell you I am a believer.  You could literally pass this off as peanut butter to some un-expecting test subject.  Thank you SunButter for saving our lives.

review/summary: Sun Butter
review/text: I am sadly disappointed with this product. I think I got a bad batch, becaused I have purchased and enjoyed Sun Butter for a number of years. I have tried the Creamy Sun Butter and the the Organic and Natural Sun Butter before and really liked them and far prefer them over Peanut Butter, Almond Butter and all other nut butters. For some reason this batch has almost no flavor at all. In the past I have found Sun Butter to have a subtle sunflower flavor that I have really enjoyed. The texture is very much like peanut butter, of course, but sunflowers are much healthier and better for you than peanuts are. I checked the expiration dates on this batch of six bottles and none are expired, and all are sealed.... so I have no idea at all why they don't taste at all like the Sun Butter I have enjoyed for maybe 5-6 years now. I really can't blame Amazon. They offered them at a good price.  These six bottles came packaged from the manufacturer.... so I just don't know what the deal is. I have only opened the first one too.... which means I still have five more to choke down.  Disappointed, but not because of the brand necessarily. I think I must have received a bad batch. An UPDATE: I recently purchased a bottle of Sun Butter "Natural" to mix with the Creamy butter style. As the Natural version separates the sunflower butter and oil it tends to be smoother. When mixed 50/50 it made a much better Sun Butter. To anyone looking to buy, I'd recommend the Natural style.

review/summary: addicted.
review/text: My son has been diagnosed with a severe peanut allergy. I have been researching and shopping for alternatives to peanut butter so that he can have a more normal life growing up. I am a major peanut butter lover but since the emergency and the diagnosis I do not allow peanut butter in my house.<br /><br />I have found love in Sunbutter. I grow more addicted by the day. I find myself craving it. Oh, and my son likes it too!<br /><br />There is an aftertaste of sunflower seed. So you need to really like sunflower seeds to like this. The initial bite you are almost tricked but ultimately it tastes like sunflower seeds...but a sweetened, delightful version. It's consistency is just like peanut butter. My mom tried it with jelly in a sandwich and she said that you still get the aftertaste but it's still very very good. I think I prefer it over peanut butter now. Yep, I said it. I've been turned. I'm so thankful for this company for manufacturing a delicious, safe, peanut-free snack for my son and for the rest of my family.<br /><br />Now that I know we will enjoy it for years to come I plan to get a continuous delivery account for it.

review/summary: Not their best product
review/text: I feel just a bit deceived by the description available here on Amazon. I don't care for "blended" nut butters. I thought perhaps this was simply a creamy version of the crunchy sunbutter from the same company, which I really loved, but this is thick and hard like standard peanut butter. It tastes fine, but I don't like the stiff texture.

We have tried a couple of brands and enjoy this one the most.  It spreads easily and makes a great sandwich -- or just a dip with apples.  Manufactured in a nut free enviroment. Glad to see it on Amazon.

review/summary: great for those with nut allergies!
review/text: Our son is severely allergic to peanuts and tree-nuts. so these Sunbutter products are such a huge blessing for us!  All the Sunbutter products are good, we just buy the "creamy" most often because it is usually the best price and you don't have to stir in the oil like some of the other "natural" kinds.  All are good though, the consistency is nice, and they taste yummy!  I use this in EVERYTHING that normally calls for peanut butter.  (Sandwiches, celery sticks, smoothies, baking...etc...) I highly recommend this product and brand.

review/summary: Perfect replacement for peanut butter - has fooled 2 kids!
review/text: The camp the kids attended this past summer did not allow peanut butter, so Mama had to find an alternative for two peanut butter loving kids.<br /><br />I spent quite a bit of money on alternatives & the kids always said, "Yuck!" I was to the point where I was going to have to try to wean them off PB for the summer, which is much easier said than done.<br /><br />I took a gamble based soley on the reviews here & we are now a Sunbutter loving family. The kids did not notice any difference & we are continuing with Sunbutter, as it is a healthier alternative to PB & now my kids can sit next to their friends at school who have peanut allergies. I like the fact that you can keep Sunbutter in the fridge or pantry. Even when I take it right out of the fridge, it is still soft enough to spread easy on the bread.

Sunbutter is by far the absolute best we've tried but it's extremely hard to find in stores and when you do find it it's over $7 a jar!<br />This 6 pack was a great deal!!! I was worried about buying so many at a time considering the same thing purchased in the stores only had about 3-4 months till the expiration date. However, the 6 pack I ordered on Amazon doesn't expire for almost a year!!! Very happy with this purchase! Thanks!!!

review/text: We live on sun butter.  We eat it daily but recently it has changed and become hard.  The product actually cracks and pulls away from the sides of the jar as a whole blob.  It is not possible to spread it without pulverizing the bread.  I am very sad that I will have to find another product.  I am looking to move to Trader Joe's Sunflower see butter.  I have contacted the company and I get no reply from them so I cannot continue to purchase this product.<br /><br />I had already received another box of sunbutter after I wrote this.  It turns out they fixed the problem and the butter is creamy again!  I am so glad! I love this stuff and eat it everyday.

review/summary: Best peanut butter alternative so far
review/text: About 9 months ago, I found out my daughter had a peanut allergy.  Since then, I've tried just about every peanut butter substitute out there.  My family found all of the soy butters we tried gross, but sunbutter was a hit.  Although it doesn't taste like peanut butter, it helps satisfy the peanut butter cravings.  If you like sunflower seeds, you will like it.  The price at Amazon is also very competitive.  It beats my local grocery store and Target, even without the subscribe and save discount.<br /><br />Be cautious if you or your child have multiple food allergies.  I let my friend try some after her son was diagnosed with PA.  Unfortunately, after eating sunbutter she discovered he also had an allergy to sunflower seeds.  Her child immediately developed a rash all over his face and hands.

review/summary: Better than soynut butter as a peanut-free alternative!
review/text: My son has Celiac disease and while he is not allergic to peanuts or tree nuts - his best friend is.  They sit next to each other during lunch in school, so I have to be careful to not harm his buddy with what I pack in my son's lunch.  I really think that this product is superior to the soynut butters that I find.  My family likes the taste of those, but I'm not comfortable adding an abundance of soy to my family's diet.<br /><br />My son has had absolutely no complaints with this.  He even asks for it at home when regular peanut butter is an option for him.  I wish I would have looked for this on Amazon sooner because they have a better deal than what I can find in my local stores.  I think that if more people would be aware of this product, more schools would agree to implement school-wide peanut free policies if they have peanut-allergic students.  (In fact, I think I'm going to point this product out to my son's school.)<br /><br />It doesn't taste like peanut butter - but it is still very good.  It tastes just like sunflower seeds.  The texture is similar to some organic peanut butters.  It's not quite as thick as Jif or Skippy and is a little oily.  It spreads on easily - which is something that I'm extremely happy about being that gluten free bread is so crumbly.  While I haven't gone crazy in using this in baking recipes, it has worked for the ones that I did try.<br /><br />I can't really comment on how long this product lasts.  I keep it in the refrigerator and we usually use it up within a few weeks.  While I realize that I've never had an open jar all that long, it never did taste rancid or off during that time.

Sunbutter, made from sunflower seeds, tastes and smells very similar to peanut butter.

review/text: Sunbutter has become the new grocery staple for me.  I developed a peanut allergy at the age of 25, having eaten peanut butter al my life.  I had always enjoyed peanut butter and had eaten it frequently, and was at a loss when I learned I could no longer have it.  I found Sunbutter about 3 years after my allergy developed, and needless to say, it was love at first sight (or taste!)  While it may not taste like peanut butter, it fufills my "fix" for peanut butter. I have never cooked with it, but have been told by a friend who has cooked with it that it does not work well in cooking.  Overall, this is a product I use on a daily basis, whether it be on a sandwich, on toast, or with veggies or crackers.

review/text: Sunbutter has the very best flavor of all the other nut spreads out there. Stores well too! This particular spread although pricey has good consistency. (Walmart's price for a similar product item is $4.59). After a little while it starts to get thick and gritty. Probably because I, as directed by the label, keep it in the refrigerator to extend the life of the product. I buy 6 at a time (auto delivery) to get the best deal.

review/text: My child has peanut allergies so we tried both soy butter and Sunbutter.  Sunbutter tastes much better!  It has a richer flavor and thicker consistency than the soy butter we tried.  My daughter requests a Sunbutter sandwich almost everyday for lunch!  Too bad it costs around 6 dollars at our local Super Target!  Trader Joe's makes a store brand for around 4 dollars a jar, but by buying the 6 pack for 21 dollars on Amazon, I can save .50 cents per jar!!!  Cool!!!  I think I will place an order here instead of trying the Trader Joe's version:)

review/summary: Very tasty and inexpensive
review/text: Taste is delicious and the price is $2-3 lower than retail. In addition, it's great that refrigeration is basically optional, so you can leave the sunflower butter at room temp for easier spreading.

review/summary: Better Than Peanut Butter!
review/text: I first bought this for a kid who is allergic to Peanut Butter. But after tasting Sunbutter, I buy it for the kid and myself. Tastes better and is better for you than Peanut Butter. I signed up for auto shipments which makes it a better deal.

review/summary: Perfect Alternative for Peanut Butter
review/text: My son is allergic to peanuts, so on a recommendation of a friend I bought this as a PB substitute.  I love it, and am happy that I can still have "PB&J's" without worrying about allergies.  The consistency is very similar and the taste is incredibly close to peanut butter.  I haven't tried baking with it yet, but am planning to do so soon.  I recommend this to absolutely anyone I meet dealing with peanut allergies!

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: Sun butter is a great alternative to peanut butter for those with allergies. It's very close to the taste of PB that I love it (and I'm a PB brand snob), yet different enough that my husband, who doesn't like PB, really likes this. Meanwhile, my peanut-allergic son loves it. (And it's far FAR better than the soy butter they try to pass off as a PB alternative.) This brand separates more than the Trader Joe's brand, but the price is a little better and it's easy enough to mix the 1-lb jars.

review/summary: Great for daycares
review/text: We use this is our daycare for a peanut butter substitute.  Prior to Sunbutter our kids missed the pbj sandwiches and peanut butter with apples after a couple of new enrollee's had peanut allergies.  With 34 kids we decided to make our center a nut free facility.  Our kids LOVE their sunbutter & jam sandwiches.  Several of the parents now use it at home instead of peanut butter.  Give it a try!!
