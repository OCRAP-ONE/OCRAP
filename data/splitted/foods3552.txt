review/summary: Pure virgin awesomeness.
review/text: I have just started cooking with coconut oil in place of vegetable oil or other genetically modified products on the recommendation of a friend.  Having done research on coconut's health benefits, I bought Spectrum organic coconut oil from a local grocery store. I loved it for cooking... especially eggs. But, because I wanted the benefits of organic, virgin, non-processed coconut oil, I did lots of research to find a virgin coconut oil.<br /><br />This is absolutely fabulous!  It has a mild coconut smell, and a mild coconut taste that is much milder in flavor when heated--you can barely taste the coconut, and I suspect only can taste it because I was specifically looking for it.<br /><br />People have spoken about eating coconut oil out of the jar.  I tried that with the Spectrum brand and shivered with the texture and taste. It was similar to taking a spoonful of Crisco and trying to swallow that.  Yuck.  Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is simply divine.  I can eat THIS straight out of the jar.  It is that good.  I can't compare to any other brand of virgin oil because this is the first I tried, but the price difference of this product made me take a chance... and I am SO glad I did.

review/summary: Wonderful stuff
review/text: I've been buying coconut oil for a long time.  I've always been satisfied with what I got, after all, what can coconut oil be?  Then I tried this one.  It has a light, delicate flavor and a wonderful texture.  I use it in my hair, to shave, on my skin, to fry eggs, to mix with other ingredients.  It adds a nice touch to chocolate cake and goes well with most flavors of cheesecake.  I like this well enough to have a subscription.  First class stuff.

review/text: Nutiva is the only coconut oil I purchase. I've purchased others that were far more expensive, but they pail in comparison to this one. I use this product for my skin, hair, nails, and cooking! It's also great for perineal massage during pregnancy and labor, as well as a moisturizer to prevent stretch marks. I transfer the oil from the large jar over to small glass jars to deal with issues of cross-contamination. Long-lasting, fragrant product. I am a loyal customer, and will definitely continue to purchase for as long as Nutiva is in business! :]

review/summary: Wonderful Product & Price
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QDRJXY">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Containers (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />I've been using this product for about a year now & love it.  Coconut oil is so beneficial and purchasing it through Amazon is certainly cost effective!  I now have my husband, sister & several friends all using it.<br /><br />This oil has totally replaced all the oils in my household. The taste is amazing and it's being used in all my cooking & baking with great results.  At first I thought the coconut taste would overpower my food but that has never happened & I've used it in bread, pastry, cookies, scones, soups, chili, EVERYTHING I cook, bake, simmer or saute.  By the way, mushrooms sauteed in coconut oil are delicious & I never used to eat mushrooms.  Now they are a favorite of mine. I also make a coconut oil/butter spread to use as a substitute for butter on toast, pancakes, etc.<br /><br />I also find uses for it out of the kitchen as well as it is a wonderful whole body & hair moisturizer.  Also great at makeup removal.  It has replaced all my skin & hair care products and I like knowing there are no artificial ingredients, perfumes, or dyes being absorbed into my skin.  Just a tiny bit in my hand goes a long way & that delicate coconut scent is just right - not the least bit overpowering at all!<br /><br />Coconut oil has great benefit for the skin also for cuts & scrapes as it is antibacterial as well as antiviral.  We use it on any skin injuries we have & it appears to speed the healing without scarring.<br /><br />I typically go through a full 54 oz container each month for my family of two now that my husband has joined in so I will start taking advantage of Amazon's subscribe & save in my next order.

review/summary: Great Value
review/text: I love coconut oil!  It is much healthier than vegetable or canola oils and doesn't feel as heavy.  It is a solid at room temperature but melts at lower temperatures than butter and can be measured just like liquid oils and used in any baking or cooking.  This one is very fragrant but it has a mild flavor and I don't notice the coconut flavor in anything except for eggs.  If you really don't like coconut, though, you may notice it.  I also spread it on toast sometimes (which is delicious) and I use it as a moisturizer (it leaves my hands feeling super soft for about 12 hours during the horribly dry winters).  This specific package is a great deal!  It comes with two 54 ounce containers.  I have been using it for about three months and am not even halfway done with the first one so even if it feels like a lot of money all at once, it is a lot cheaper than buying the smaller containers more often.

review/text: We began using Nutiva coconut oil on the recommendation of a friend. He gave us our first jar and we have been hooked since then. The health benefits are more than I would list here but encourage those interested to explore on Nutivas web site. Nutiva is the best tasting coconut oil and the product has always been consistently excellent. It it also great for your skin as well as baking. We enjoy popcorn with the oil on it. Our friends and family are purchasing the product after we introduced it to them. Purchasing this product via Amazon gives us the best buy and it arrives at our door in two days.

review/summary: Nature's Perfect Oil!
review/text: I cannot say enough good things about pure, cold pressed, extra virgin organic coconut oil. This coconut oil is A+ quality. I've also tried Garden of Life's brand which is  equally as good except more expensive. I didn't discover coconut oil until a couple weeks ago and I LOVE it. I use it in my protein shakes, I spread it on toast, it's the only oil I consider for cooking!! And that's not all folks! I put a layer on my face every night and it has made my skin silky smooth while helping dispel toxins and acne!!! I put it on my feet at night also because we get rid of much toxins from our feet, so by putting coconut oil on it not only will your feet be amazingly soft, but it will also detoxify your body!! Last but not least I use it for "oil pulling" which is when you take 1 Tbsp and swish it around in your mouth, 'pulling' it through your teeth for 15-20 minutes, and then spit the oil out. This is an amazing way to detoxify your entire body, AND it whitens your teeth!! All of these uses I named still pale in comparison to all the possible uses of Coconut Oil. So go out and get some for yourself because it's likely one of the best purchases you'll ever make!! I know it was for me =)

review/summary: Fresh, flavorful, and hexane-free
review/text: I've tried a few different brands of extra-virgin coconut oil, and for the most part I'm equally satisfied with them all. Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar. I should specify the qualities I look for in a coconut oil: I want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste, maximum nutrition, and minimal processing. For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find "packed on" and "best before" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the "best before" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as "organic." Do a little research; "cold-pressed," "organic," AND "hexane-free" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn't found it on sale at a good price. I put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar. Of course, at this larger size, you might prefer a plastic jar to eliminate some of the weight, but for storage purposes, glass might be best.

review/summary: Superb oil for health
review/text: I've tried others, but Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is by far the tastiest and easiest to eat.  I absolutely love it.  I just eat it right out of the jar, several tablespoonfuls a day, for the health and weight loss benefits.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.<br /><br />I've read through the reviews and just wanted to clarify some things with actual facts for those who are interested.  Saturated fat, such as coconut oil, butter, lard, tallow, etc., is not only NOT harmful, but it is ESSENTIAL for good health and need not and should not be limited in quantity as the government suggests.  It does NOT clog arteries--that is a lie that has been propagated for the last 60 years and thankfully there are finally practitioners with the courage and common sense to speak the truth.  I am a dentist, intimately involved in nutrition, and I know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />The majority of coconut oil is medium chain triglycerides which are broken down quickly by the liver for energy.  It raises metabolic rate, thus promoting weight loss, and it does work.  But you should know that butter is healthy, too, and has some important long chain fatty acids, and it, too, will promote weight loss.  Heavy cream is essentially butter before it's been churned.  So certainly eat coconut oil--it has myriad health benefits--but eat all your saturated fats, including plenty of fatty, red meat.<br /><br />Coconut oil will not oxidize and go rancid.  You can leave it on the counter probably for years.  So don't worry about buying too much.  And for the same reason, a dark jar is not necessary.  Please know that liquid seed and nut oils, and even fish oil, will go rancid, because of the high unsaturated content.  These oils oxidize quickly and form free radicals.  They are a major contributing factor in virtually all the prevalent diseases and disorders from which people suffer.<br /><br />And finally to those complaining of the plastic jar, most of us, especially those who use a lot of coconut oil, would just as soon accept the "horrifying" risks of plastic jars rather than paying a fortune for shipping glass jars.  We don't all have extra bags of cash lying around.

I substitute coconut oil whenever the recipe calls for butter, vegetable oil (microwave the coconut oil to liquefy) or shortening. I've used it to bake cookies, muffins, bread, sweet dinner rolls, etc.  Everything comes out moist and delicious, with no worry about trans fats. I definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: The healtiest oil you can use
review/text: If you research, organic, unrefined cold pressed extra virgin coconut oil, you will see that it is a medium chain triglyceride. This means that it goes straight to the liver to be stored for energy. It doesn't go into the bloodstream, where it can break off & deposit in the arteries in the form of plaque.<br />Coconut oil is a clear liquid at 76 degrees. Your body, being 98.6, keeps it in a clear liquid state, so it cannot solidify in the body as butters or margarines do.<br />Coconut and avocado oils are healthy fats that have been maligned for years. This is a con game just to get more people on to cholesterol lowering drugs.<br />It's subtle coconut flavor and high smoking point make it very useful in cooking and baking. Olive oil now only gets used for quick sauteing and salads. Butter now gets used very sparingly as well. We use mashed avocado or coconut oil in baked potato instead of globs of butter.<br />My husband uses it on his hair and skin as a moisturizer.<br />My only disapointment is that Nutiva does not use Glass jars instead of plastic.<br />Give your body a break and try Nutiva coconut oil.

review/summary: Oh, how much can say about this oil?!
review/text: There aren't enough words to express how much I love this coconut oil!  I got one jar for cooking and one for my skin and hair.  And, now, I don't ever want to be without it.  I went no-poo about 6 weeks ago and my scalp and hair is so happy! My eczema and dandruff has been under control like never before since I started using coconut oil.  If you have eczema and/or dandruff, soak your hair and scalp with coconut oil, put a plastic cap on (to avoid a big mess) for about 2 hours and then vigorously wash it out thoroughly with very warm forceful water. Apply a detangler (not the spray-on leave-in type); rinse it out after 3 minutes and while hair is soaking wet, massage in a small to medium amount (depending on hair length) of coconut oil as a leave-in conditioner.  Don't worry coconut oil is absorbent and it doesn't cause oil stains.  Style hair as usual...

review/text: I've been using coconut oil for cooking and skin moisturizer for years. I've tried many brands, but the Nutiva is the best tasting and smelling for the price.  I wish it were possible to get it in glass to avoid the plastic exposure. This is the only coconut oil I buy, and I've found Amazon has the lowest price.

review/text: This is a great price on a very healthy oil. It is one of the few oils that contain Medium-Chain Triglycerides, which are very healthy to consume. It also does not have a strong coconut taste, so it doesn't change the taste of things much. I put a tablespoon in a cup of coffee, with a little cream, and it's virtually undetectable. (Other than the fact there is a little oil in your coffee! But that's what cream is anyway, so...)

review/text: I am loving this coconut oil.  It's a difficult thing to find in stores and I've been searching for a good alternative to cooking with olive oil since it has such a low smoke point.

review/text: This is a great product.  It melts beautifully, smells divine, leaves a very subtle flavor of coconut which I find lovely.  I can't wait to try it out on homemade doughnuts.  The only negative comment I have is that during the filling of the jar, a large air bubble formed.  It actually looked full when I took the lid off, but when I dipped into it, there was a large void which meant that my jar was only about 2/3 full.  I love the product and was very, very impressed with how quickly it arrived.

However, I hate the container, and here's why:<br />A) Unless the oil is in it's solid state, it's a huge pain to get out of the container.<br />B) The container leaks (if you unknowingly knock it over in the cupboard on a really hot day and makes a terrible mess ;)).<br />I've still bought the stuff twice and will likely continue as the price and oil are both great. I just keep one in the fridge and one in another container for the cupboard.

review/text: I bought the 54-oz (2pack)and I love this stuff.  I did some research on the cocnut oil and the ways to use it and it's pretty amazing.  I use it in my hair an hour before shower and let me tell you, my hair is shiner, the ends look beautiful and overall, my hair is fuller.  I suggest youtubing on how to apply. My daughter has eczema and the coconut stops the itch and flare ups.  I no longer use facial mosturizer, I use coconut oil.  It makes zits go away in 1 or 2 nights.  I use it as body mosturizer at night and I am good all day.  I mix coarse sea salt and coconut oil to exfolliate my skin, better than expensive spa treatment.  They sell this mixture and it's $25 a jar(12oz)!!!!!  It does wonders for my feet, oil them down and sock it.  Be advised, LITTLE goes a long way.  I have not tried it yet but you can cook with it also but the hair and skin benefits are truly amazing.<br /><br />A co-worker and her family got severly burned by the FL sun (2nd degree burn)and I applied the coconut oil on it and she loved it and went out and bought some.  Somehow is stopped the itch and the burn feeling and their skin recovered in two days!!!!  I use it on scratches, cuts and burns.  It leaves no scar and heals MUCH faster than neosporin.<br /><br />I went to Nutiva site and there is a shortage due to weather and I have noticed the prices going up but it is still well worth it.  I do love this brand.  It absorbs quickly and leaves a sweet coconut scent.  My kids love it but do not like it on their face because the smell bothers them but on their bodies they are okay with.

review/text: Excellent product and at a steal of a price. Its organic, unrefined, and COLD PRESSED. You cant get a more healthy and natural oil to fry with at the highest temperature you want! I highly recommend.<br /><br />However since it is so natural is DOES smell and taste like coconut (shocking to some, perhaps). This usually cooks out but occasionally when I use it there is a residual sweetness lingering that may be off compared to the style of food. The best way to avoid this is using separate utensils from when you prepared / cooked. This is an obvious need when dealing with meat, but if making vegetarian or vegan meals you may not think about it.

review/text: I LOVE Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.  I use it for frying, in place of butter in baking, in place of butter on veggies or even on bread.  It's healthier than butter, doesn't break down at high heat like other oils, and I like the taste.  Nutiva is better than other brands in that it is smooth and completely free of chunks.  Be aware that it melts in the jar in the summer heat.  This is normal.  At lower temps it will go back to solid form without any change in quality.  If a recipe calls for oil, you can melt the coconut oil for ease of measuring.

review/summary: Coconut oil is great!
review/text: I never used coconut oil before purchasing this produce in Dec 2010.  Took me 2 months to go through first container and I am sure I'll finish the second within a month.<br /><br />Coconut oil has almost completely replaced any frying oil.  It beats any other oil for popcorn!  Use it for skin lotion, perfect for massages and hair conditioner.

review/text: I use the big tubs for cooking.  I put Coconut Oil in everything, even spread it on my toast. I love this brand and it is very good for you.  The only oil that your body can break down naturally without a gall bladder.  Don't listen to the cholesteral hype, try for yourself and decide.

review/summary: All around BEST coconut oil !!
review/text: I've tried a half dozen brands of coconut oil, including another sold here on Amazon.  Nutiva beats all the brands ... hands down !!!  It has worked as an oil/shortening substitute for everything from frying to baking .. to popcorn ... to simply spreading on toasted bagels or bread (killer garlic bread - French or Italian).  It works wonderfully for making herb butters, too.  If you like, you can blend it with olive oil or butter, though I have not found the need to do so.  If I'm not using in foods, then I'll eat a couple tablespoons daily.  Good also as a moisturizer for hands/skin ... and the health/nutritional benefits are finally and increasingly being recognized and praised.  Amazon occasionally discounts the 54 oz tubs a bit ... so I wait around for that, to save money.  Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil even looks beautiful in the jars/tubs.  It's got a cool pearlescent look.  You won't regret trying this product, and you'll be hooked on it!<br /><br />UPDATE !!! ... 9-17-12 (nearly a year after my raving review, above).  I have learned that while there is "Virgin" coconut oil, there is no such thing as "Extra Virgin" coconut oil.  I'll have to ask Nutiva about that.  Nutiva looks, smells and tastes great, but there have not been any good sales for it on Amazon for a while now.  I found 16 ounce bottles of excellent virgin coconut oil at Trader Joe's for only $5.99/bottle.  It also looks, smells and tastes great!  Do the math !!!  Basically, what will cost you $54.71 (plus shipping, unless you have "Prime") on Amazon, you can get (in equal quality) at Trader Joe's for only $40.43 .....  I've ordered Nutiva many times from Amazon, but I will now put that on "hold" until the price comes down.  Cheers to good health ... including the health of the membrane in your wallet!!

review/summary: 1000 and 1 Uses
review/text: I originally bought this for my naturally curly, sometimes frizzy hair.  Many products that I previously appeared to be oil in a small bottle with a dropper top,  Then I read the label.  Flammable???  I was putting flammable stuff on my hair?  Nothankyou!  And, no, I have never used hairspray, which is also flammable.<br /><br />Anyweigh, I use this on my hair.  For dry hair, I put a very, very small amount in the palm of my hand, rub palms together vigorously, and rub lightly over hair.  When my hair is wet, I apply a bit more to the ends.  Also, once a week, as a deep treatment for my hair, I massage into my scalp and apply liberally to my hair.  Leave in for at least two hours, then shampoo normally.  When my hair dries, it absolutely glows like a sunset on fire.<br /><br />Doing more research, however, I found many more uses.  Following are several uses:<br /><br />Dandruff or itchy scalp, massage into scalp. Leave in a couple of hours, shampoo normally<br />Athlete's foot - massage over foot, wear socks<br />Dry foot - same as above<br />Preshave treatment - massage a small amount over face, shave normally<br />Eye makeup remover<br />As a toothpaste - it helps bind calcium to teeth and the antibacterial properties of CO help promote healthy gums - don't stop using regular toothpaste!<br />As a *cough* love balm<br />As a furniture polish<br />Taken orally, about Tbs/day, lowers blood sugar, cholesterol, *aids* in weight loss and dementia/Alzheimers<br />To make a chocolate shell over ice cream, melt chocolate, add CO, mix, pour over ice cream<br />Feed 1-2 Tbs to your dog, depending on size, gives them a shiny coat/helps with hot, itchy spots.  Dogs love it!<br />If you have sleep apnea and use a CPAP machine, apply a small amount in nostrils. This will prevent drying out.<br />Use for diaper rash<br />Use in recipes - bread, cookies, frying. CO is a *saturated* fat, but it is plant based, so it doesn't pose the same problems animal based oils<br />Shooz! - massage into worn, scuffed leather - shooz, bootz, hand bags<br />For breastfeeding women, apply to dry, cracked nipples<br />Can be good for acne, because of anti-bacterial properties.  However, everyone's skin is different. Some report great success; others report worsened breakouts<br />Relieves sunburn pain<br />Helps strengthen nails<br />Helps control candida<br />Helps remove sticky labels and the 'goo' from sticky labels<br />Make truffles<br /><br />To the Grammar Nazis.

The only reason I use it on my skin is because I love the way it makes me smell.<br /><br />I have had bottles for short periods of time and seen them develop mold but I use them anyway, When it gets to the bottom I just use that part for my skin. It is wonderful and I will keep buying it. It is also quite affordable.

review/summary: In moderation...
review/text: Marvelous product this Nutiva OEV Coconut Oil. I can highly recommend it as part of a balanced diet. It SHOULD however be consumed in moderation. The health benefits will likely include both an increased feeling of energy as well as the potential for excess calorie burning. Benefits are primarily due to the medium-chain trigycerides, or MCTs. (COMPRISED OF caproic acids, caprylic acids, capric acids and lauric acids)<br /><br />While I am a doctor specializing in the cardio-vascular system, you should not solely rely on my advice, nor anyone else posting comments for this product. You should, instead, talk to your own personal physician about your diet. He or she is in the best position to assist you since, regardless of the number of people who believe to the contrary, one size does not fit all.<br /><br />Returning to MCT's... it should be noted that while they appear to aid in the metabolism of proteins, diabetics and those with known liver problems or suspected liver conditions should not consume daily amounts unless directed to do so by a physician. As this Nutiva coconut oil and others are high in MCT's (roughly 67 percent!), you should consult before beginning a daily "dosage".<br /><br />One reviewer who claimed to be a 'Herbie, who doesn't like to make toys', stated that saturated fats are not harmful. This is untrue. All saturated fats have the potential to be harmful as they assist the corruption of artery walls and plaque in those walls when consumed in quantities beyond what your PERSONAL metabolism will handle. As I noted previously, and this point deserves a caps-lock... ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL.<br /><br />Herbie additionally made claim that butters and plenty of red meat should also be eaten. Unsure what his definition of 'plenty" is, but again, medical doctors who you can personally visit and discuss your diet with will suggest moderation. If they don't suggest moderation when it comes to saturated fats, they are either in denial or sat-fat stockholders in some way.<br /><br />Lastly, there are NO studies which suggest a direct link between the consumption of large amounts of coconut oil and vastly improved exercise performance. You will likely feel increased energy, but it won't translate directly into being able to do twice the number of push-ups, lifting twenty percent more weight at the bench or biking up that steep hill you've always dreamed of trying. You can reach those points but it's a slow process that will be dependent on all the factors within your lifestyle.

review/text: The oil itself is great- my complaint is with the actual amount that is received in the container. When you open the lid, it looks like the entire container is filled with the oil. However, once you get past about the top two inches, you realize that there is about 5 inches of empty air. So, in reality, while you are paying for a 54 oz container of oil, you are really only receiving about 1/2 that much.

review/summary: No Allergy Information
review/text: I think this oil is fine, but I'm giving it a lower score because the company really fails at identifying the product's potential for cross contamination with peanut oil. The product label, as well as the website, are completely lacking in any allergy information. I love using coconut oil for my family, and have tried this oil at my sister's home, but have not used it in my own home because of my daughter's severe peanut allergy. I wrote to the company to inquire about their handling process, and here's a summary of their response:<br /><br />Nutiva organic EV coconut oil is produced in a manufacturing plant that does process peanut oil. We process our EV coconut oil on its own dedicated manufacturing line that we sterilize before and after every use. We also manufacture our coconut oil at different times than the peanut oil, but we can't guarantee there isn't any cross contamination.<br /><br />It was a thorough and quick response, but allergy info really should be printed on the label, or at the very least on the website. For some people with slight sensitivities or minor allergies, their manufacturing process may be diligent enough, and could be ok, but for those with severe allergies, it probably isn't worth the risk. I've ordered and used the VitaCost coconut oil, which is produced in a peanut-free facility, and it's been very good.

The first Coconut oil I bought was Kevala, 1 gallon, and it tasted, smelled and felt better in my mouth than Nutiva.  The 54 ounce Nutiva oil smells artificial or chemical.  Maybe that's because it is packed directly into the plastic jar, whereas Kevala packs their Coconut oil in a bag, inside another bag, inside the plastic bucket.  I cancelled my subscription to Nutiva and am going back to Kevala.  Too bad I can't return the Nutiva!

review/summary: Toasty smell
review/text: I bought this oil for the first time two years ago. Back then I wasn't very happy about the particular toasty smell Nutiva coconut oil has. I had tried other cold pressed, virgin coconut oils which smell lightly of fresh coconut and this one smells quite different. I didn't like this because, back then, I had just switched to cooking exclusively with coconut oil and did not want all my savory dishes to smell of coconut so I purchased a gallon of another brand and used that for cooking.<br /><br />I also had to stop using it as a face and body oil because I found the toasty smell overwhelming, even though it doesn't seem to linger but, still, I just couldn't stand it.<br /><br />However, I have now started to bake from scratch and, since Nutiva remains pretty inexpensive here on Amazon, decided to buy it again, just to use in baking and I'm very pleased with the results. I've used it in muffins, cakes and pie and crostata doughs with very nice results. Somehow I can't detect the coconut smell once the pastries come out of the oven.<br /><br />For those who love the scent of coconut -with a toasty twist-, this product by Nutiva is a good deal and worth a try.

The reviews on this Brand were great except for one that discourages using anything in plastic. Researching that, it appears that inside the recycling symbol, Nutiva container has the number 2 which is considered safe. The numbers 2-4-5 are considered safe, number 1, which is most water bottles, is considered safe but not for re-use, and the numbers 3-6-7 are considered unsafe. Most Foam cups are number 6, many 5 gallon water bottles are number 7. Also, although there are microwavable containers, it is not recommended to Nuke plastics. Hope this helps any concerns.

review/summary: Most delicious popcorn ever!
review/text: I'm a real popcorn nut.  I've been trying for years to get that real "movie theatre" taste.  Well, I've done it, and one better.  The theatres use coconut oil blended with butter "flavoring".  The problem is it's partially hydrogenated, which as most of you know is not healthy.  This Nutiva Coconut Oil is pure, and extra virgin.  Used by itself in popcorn, the taste is a bit too coconutty for me.  The secret?  Add about 1/4 real butter to the coconut oil in your popper.  Yes, real butter is healthy for you, unlike margarines or so called buttery toppings.  So the perfect blend of Nutiva Coconut oil and butter produces the most excellent popcorn you could ever imagine.  You feel good after eating it.  Also a couple of other tips, all popcorn kernals are not created equal.  Use Orville's for a much more tender pop.  And get popcorn salt, not regular salt, and not Flavacol.  Popcorn salt is super flaky and sticks like magic to the popcorn.  Simply add it in the popper while it's popping.  Adjust accordingly for your taste.  Enjoy!

review/text: I started to use coconut oil in place of butter since last year. It works out just fine. Sometimes, I even use it on cracked dried skin. The oil itself should get a 5 star rating but its plastic bottle makes it lose a star.

review/summary: Surprisingly high quality for everyday use.
review/text: I originally bought this coconut oil at a health food store because they had some sort of promotional sale, and I moved soon after, so this big jar ended up in storage for more than a year.  I finally came across it when sorting through boxes, and assumed it would go in the discard pile.  I know how delicate some oils are, and rancid oil is especially bad for you.  So it was surprising that this jar was still as fresh as new - I later read that coconut is one of the most stable oils.<br /><br />At first it was a little alarming that the oil in the jar normally resembles something like shortening or the lard we had on the farm, or it can melt in the jar and be clear when the room temperature is higher in summer.  But I take it by the spoonful right out of the jar.  It is also good for cooking, like scrambled eggs and so on, I use it interchangeably with butter now.  I also really like it on my skin for moisturizing after a shower.<br /><br />I agree that I normally prefer a glass container for almost everything.  I am extremely sensitive to plastic fumes of any kind, partially because of medication I take.  I can't even drink from plastic "glasses" because they smell funny, hard to explain especially when visiting. That being said, I detect no fumes from this packaging, maybe it is a special kind of plastic like that used for my blender jug.  I don't know for sure, but I am fine with this jar.<br /><br />I would recommend this oil to anyone who has made the choice to start getting healthier.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: We use this instead of shortening in all our baking.  Makes great pie crust.  Be careful though, the coconut flavor is pretty strong in some bakery - make sure it's compatible with your ingredients.  It adds a wonderful flavor to chocolate cake or brownies.

review/summary: Versatile and Pretty Fabulous Product...
review/text: I first bought Coconut oil at the health food store and spent ten bucks for a 16 ounce container. Once I realized the flexibility and benefits of coconut oil, I wanted a better price. This is it. Though this price varies (I've spent in the range 35-45 dollars for 128 ounces on Amazon which amounts to a significant drop in cost to what I paid locally.)the price is right.<br /><br />I've had one container that had hard, tiny beads of coconut oil, but it still did what it was supposed to do, though they were a little more resistant to melting. Otherwise, in the three batches we've purchased, this is the only minor complaint.<br /><br />I use it to replace shortening, or to fry, and it's perfect for baking. The coconut flavor is there, but it's subtle. If you hate the flavor of coconut you might want to think twice. I thought I did, but the more I started thinking along the lines of embracing coconut I realized the texture of shredded coconut was what I had issues with. Coconut oil makes delicious stove popped popcorn that doesn't need butter for more flavor ...it ends up with kind of a sweet/buttery taste. Cookies, brownies, etc are delicious with coconut oil replacing butter or margarine.<br /><br />This product is also my only moisturizer and lotion of choice. We scoop some out of the main container (into a recycled hummus jar, short, with a wide mouth) and store it in the bathroom. This past winter, before I started using coconut oil as a moisturizer/lotion, my skin was painfully dry. I drink lots of water, and I was using different products, but my skin was not happy. Seriously, Coconut oil is the best. It soaks in quickly, though not immediately, and it really took care of the itchy dry. I was a little more concerned about my face. But my skin was so dry I felt like smiling would crack my face, so I dove in and tried it. Perfect. Again, it doesn't soak in immediately. I put it on, get dressed, do my hair, then apply my makeup. My foundation brush has sucked up some of the oil so I'll need to replace those maybe sooner than I would otherwise. But for a facial moisturizer that works as well as anything I've ever tried and costs about $.35 an ounce...I think I can live with that. I also haven't had any clogging of pores and I'm an aging T-Zone skin.

review/text: I go through one 54-ounce tub of Nutiva Coconut Oil a month. This stuff is now the secret ingredient to my diet. I've been working out an hour a day, I take 1 tablespoon with my oatmeal, and I do two cups of my exotic teas with 1 tablespoon in each cup, for a total of 3 tablespoons a day. We also cook with it and use it as a skin moisturizer!<br /><br />I've lost 25 pounds in 2 months! I LOVE how this stuff makes me feel energetic, makes me feel younger, and keeps me feeling full. That's a sign that my body is getting what it needs without the 4,000-5,000 calories I used to eat before learning about healthy living.<br /><br />I highly recommend watching the film "Fat Head" which should open your eyes to why the "low fat diet" is absolutely making us all fatter.

review/text: I originally purchased this oil for my dog who had been diagnosed with cancer.  Much research found that coconut oil was a cancer fighter, so I purchased this and began adding it not only to his food but my other dog's food as well and boy did they love it!  It has a wonderful coconut aroma and is a good supplement not only for the dogs but for myself as well.  I use it to cook, in my coffee, and even on my skin.  It's truly a wonderful product with many uses and so good for you, you can't go wrong with it!

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: If you are thinking about trying coconut oil for the first time and you are not sure which one to try, buy Nutiva!! You cannot go wrong!  My first purchase was from GNC and was not cheap but tasted and smelled cheap.  I ordered Nutiva and will never buy anything else! This oil has a white color and great smell and the best part is the TASTE! It has a clean coconut taste I did not get with the other brand.<br /><br />I am excited to see Amazon selling two 54 oz at such a great price.  This oil is addictive and I don't want to run out.  I use it from head to toe.  It is great for your hair, face, body and feet but even better when ingested.  I take 1 tablespoon 3 times a day.  If you don't care for the taste of the oil put it melted into a very cold yogurt and it will harden like the outer layer of chocolate on an ice cream bar!<br /><br />I now have more energy and appearance has improved.  I love this product and will never be without it thanks to Amazon!!

review/summary: THE REAL DEAL!!
review/text: I was skeptical about this at first because I had purchased coconut oil from another supplier and it had "no" smell at all....very disappointed! However after seeing all of the great reviews I thought I'd give Nutiva a try. People!! This product is fabulous! THe aroma is heavenly (if you like coconut). You will NOT be disappointed! It didn't come in a glass jar and that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Besides that...it's flawless. NOW I know that real coconut oil is clear when it melts...not yellowish. Don't be fooled by all those other brands. Even if it says "Pure" it's not. You want to make sure it says "unrefined" and "cold pressed"! Nutiva doesn't just have a hint of coconut aroma...it's (bursting) with a bold smell..and the taste is UNBELIEVEABLE...I actually bought it for my hair, but after tasting it...I will definately cook with it. You'll love it!!! P.S. Rub a little on your skin (mmmmm)Your partner will love you for it!
