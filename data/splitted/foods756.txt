review/summary: Highly addictive! Great with beer
review/text: I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!

review/summary: Wasabi Lovers Rejoice! These Wasabi SoySauce Blue Diamond Almonds Taste Fantastic!!
review/text: Hello everyone, I just had to write a review for these Wasabi and Soy Sauce flavored Blue Diamond Almonds, because I enjoy them sooooooo much! I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond. The flavor is fantastic, as it is spicy but not so much to bring tears to your eyes. Also, the price of this product is great as well. Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving. Treat yourself to these awesome almonds today!

review/text: I am addicted to sushi, which is an expensive addiction.  I always keep a tin of these at work and at home to satisfy the craving.  My boyfriend, who doesn't like sushi, really enjoys these too, so they aren't just for sushi lovers.  I believe they are roasted, so they are not as healthy as raw almonds, but they still make a great afternoon snack.

review/summary: The best almond flavor out there. How could something so delish be so good for you?
review/text: The "Jalapeno Smokehouse" flavor is the best flavor in the Blue Diamond "BOLD" series, hands down. Unlike some of the other flavors, this one really tastes like what it's supposed to taste like -- that is to say, smoky jalapeno peppers. To my jaded taste buds, the pepper spice is fairly mild, but I imagine most people find it packs quite a kick. It's a good thing these huge, perfectly roasted nuts are great for you, because I eat them constantly. Hey, my HDL cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol) has actually risen as I've gotten older. I like to think it's partly because of these luscious babies. Dr Jeddy prescribes a handful every day!

review/summary: Not as crunchy as the other Blue Diamond flavors
review/text: I'm addicted to Blue Diamond almonds. I've tried all the flavors -- and this was the last one I tried. I love salt, I love vinegar, and I love salt-and-vinegar potato chips, so how could I lose with these?<br /><br />Well, I'm just not that into them. The flavor's great and the almonds are fresh, but somehow the texture just fails. The almonds just seem... soggy. They don't have that wonderful crunch that the other Blue Diamond flavors have. And that flattens out the whole experience of eating them. I've eaten about 10 bags so far, and they all have the same lackluster texture.<br /><br />Oh well. Guess even my ol' reliable Blue Diamond can't hit it out of the park every time.

review/text: I don't know what they put in these things, but whatever it is it's addictive. The combination of soy sauce salty and wasabi spicy create the perfect storm of "I'm going to eat this entire can RFN."<br /><br />The cans are all perfectly sealed and the almonds are always fresh - what else can you ask for? The cost is also lower than in local stores, but you can buy the larger bags cheaper (per oz) from some Walmarts if you can find them.<br /><br />Almonds are supposed to be appetite suppressants, but for me it's usually because I ate an entire can of them and am not hungry any more.

review/summary: Great Low Carb snack to go!!
review/text: Before we switched to eating low carb, we used to LOVE a nice big bag of chips.  I was missing those zesty salty crunchy snacks, until we found these delicious almonds!  I have tried all of the flavors and love them all, but these are my current favorite.  I like the snack size packs as a reminder that I have had enough since I can never stop eating them (just like potato chips, no one can eat just one).  A whole package is only  8 grams of carbs (only 4 grams of net carbs if you are an Atkins dieter).  These almonds have a nice crisp texture (even better if you put them in the refrigerator for a bit) and the seasoning is evenly distributed.  Not to strong, but also not too weak that it gets lost on the almonds. A package of 12 only lasted about a week in our home, back to order more.

review/summary: A healthy addiction
review/text: Not generally a big fan of wasabi or of almonds, but somehow find these particular wasabi and soy sauce almonds to be a healthy addiction. My doctor recommended almonds as an excellent low-carb, high protein, high fiber snack with heart healthy fat and this flavor is great to meet that suggestion while providing a nice savory and spicy snack with a little salty crunch.  A little bit spicy but not too much (I don't tolerate really spice foods well).  I tried the smokehouse flavor by the same brand and didn't like it, but I could live on these wasabi and soy sauce almonds. The soy sauce flavor is hardly noticeable but just nicely tones down the heat of the wasabi.

review/text: I've been participating in Weight Watchers for the last couple months (doing well).  I like to have a healthy snack at work mid-afternoon so I bought a bag of these at the grocery store.  They are so good I can't stop at 23 (a serving size).  I am not going to buy these again until I'm at my goal because I can't stop eating them.  They are quite salty so if you are trying to control your sodium, beware.  They are not as "hot" as wasabi peas, a more gentle kick.  I highly recommend them. Very savory.

But it's a much healthier alternative. They are still high in fat, as all nuts are, so eating a whole can in one sitting is probably not the thing to do. But a handful in the afternoon really takes care of my salt craving, the bold vinegar flavor makes a little go a long way and I'm getting some good nutrients too. As others mentioned, of all the "bold" flavors, this seems to be the one that is hardest to find in stores. Thank you, Amazon!

review/text: I love salt and vinegar chips, but never feel full even if I eat a whole bag.  (and I will!!!)  I thought the idea of salt and vinegar almonds sounded gross, but was willing to give it a try.  And boy they are great!  They have about twice the vinegar punch of most chips, and are amazingly good, and the fat is the good kind, and you get plenty full on the almonds.  Mmmmmm.<br /><br />I was buying the tins (which are sometimes available at the grocery store), but then realized I couldn't stop once I opened a tin and was eating something like 1,200 calories in a single day just on almonds.  So these packs are perfect - there are enough almonds to really satisfy a hungry stomach, but not so much to blow your diet.  And they're great to stash when you know that you won't be able to grab a real meal, but don't want to find yourself at a vending machine or 7Eleven buying crap b/c you're so hungry.  Even my (naturally thin) hubby loves them.  Perfect!

review/summary: Not a typical nut
review/text: This flavor is the best of the bunch by far.  I am reluctantly on a diet that allows for a few almonds as a snack.  I tried these and I was hooked.  Unfortunately, most stores do not carry this flavor.  My first case went very quickly, as every co-worker who tried them wanted a can of their own.  I recommend them to anyone, not only those of us trying to stick to a diet that deprives us of less healthy snacks.

review/summary: Absolutely the yummiest of the Blue Diamond flavored almonds
review/text: I've tried smokehouse, jalapeno smokehouse, honey roast, lime and chili, and natural. But these are really the best of the lot I've tried. They have the nice fresh-tasting almonds you expect from Blue Diamond, and you can actually taste the wasabi (unlike the jalapeno smokehouse, where the jalapeno part is really elusive).<br /><br />I was reluctant at first to try this. Didn't think I'd like it. I was wrong. Terrific snack almonds (if you don't mind saltiness). Love em.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: You can definitely taste the salt & vinegar
review/text: Even though I (thought) I hated them for 25 years, I am a recent convert to the great taste and nutritional value of almonds. It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too "dry," some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.<br /><br />The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are "too" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12.

review/summary: A nice enough flavor, but I wouldn't describe it as either "Blazin'" or "Buffalo Wing."
review/text: I'll start off by noting that I love almonds, I eat almonds every day, and I particularly love Blue Diamond almonds. The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting. Blue Diamond almonds get 5 stars on all those parameters.<br /><br />And I've tried all their flavors, especially their "BOLD" line. Alas, their definition of "BOLD" is apparently "a little too spicy for kids." This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-"blazin'." It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here. There's not even a hint of Tabasco, for example.<br /><br />As I said, this is a pleasant enough flavor, especially if you need a little change from, say, my favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK">Jalapeno Smokehouse</a>. But it doesn't taste much like anything in particular. They could have called it "BOLD Generic Faux-Spicy Snack to be Eaten Brainlessly While Watching the Game" flavor and it would have been more accurate.

review/summary: Not the best flavor
review/text: Ordered these because I wanted to try them and none of the stores in my area seem to carry them. Normally I eat the habanero bbq or the wasabi.<br /><br />For spiciness they are better than the habanero but not as much as the wasabi can be (though in all fairness the wasabi is in a whole different taste spectrum anyway)<br /><br />Flavorwise is where they lose out. They taste MUCH saltier and the flavor itself is overpowered by that until you get to the end zing where the spice kicks in.<br /><br />In summary, they are edible and I will finish off the cans that I ordered but I will go back to purchasing my wasabi and habanero after that.

review/summary: Not As Balanced As Other Bold Flavors, But Not Bad
review/text: I went out on a limb trying Blue Diamond Almonds Bold - Wasabi & Soy flavor.  I had never had wasabi before, but I have like many of the other "Bold" flavors Blue Diamond makes (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Habanero BBQ) so I decided to give them a try.  The flavor is definitely bold.  It reminds me of the horseradish flavor that is common in many deli mustards.  It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the "soy" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.  Combine that with almonds being one of the healthier snack options, and you've good a good treat.  Much like the other flavors, the bold flavor makes moderation fairly easy as I could not imagine going overboard on these.  Enjoy!

review/text: To start, I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I had never seen the Blazin' Buffalo Wing flavor at the local grocery store so I ordered them here on Amazon.<br /><br />When you first put an almond in your mouth you get the initial hint of buffalo wing flavor but it quickly goes away and then just tastes kind of strange.<br /><br />They aren't bad but they aren't my favorite. Every bodies taste buds are different so you might like them but I don't think I'll buy this flavor again.

These nuts were horrific...they had this...harsh acerbic taste to them that I just could not enjoy. I ended up wiping most of the flavoring off and chopping the nuts up to put in stuff like salads. The nuts themselves are high quality and always taste fresh, so at least I was able to get some use from them. However, I would never  buy these again and if you are not experienced with wasabi, you may want to think twice before buying them lol.

review/text: I picked up a can of these after the glowing reviews I read for it. To keep it short, it has a very authentic wasabi taste. It literally tastes like an almond dipped in wasabi sauce. And that, to me, doesn't make the most appealing snack. I find the wasabi flavor overwhelming, and none of the soy flavor coming through. I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally. I gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor, and it certainly tastes like that.

review/text: This is one of my favorites in the Blue Diamond "BOLD" flavors line. There's a nice balance of heat vs sweet, and the saltiness isn't overwhelming. You can eat 'em by the handful, and probably will once you taste them.<br /><br /> However, true hot-pepper fans know that the heat of the Habanero pepper is a fearsome thing. You won't find much of it here, just a little hint. That's probably for the best, given that most people can't tolerate the blazing intensity of those devilish little peppers. But I kind of wish Blue Diamond would put out a "BOLD, and This Time We Mean It" line for those of us who really do love spicy foods.

review/text: Blue Diamond Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are a great snack.  Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts that you can eat, and the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor is very similar to chipotle.  This isn't too surprising since a chipotle is a smoked jalapeno after all.  From a nutrition stand point, the only special consideration that doesn't come will all almonds is the 180 mg of sodium per serving.  Unless you get a plain, unsalted nut this is pretty typical.  I like to keep a can of these either in my desk or in the pantry at home for snacking.  Grabbing a handful of these is great between meals when hunger strikes.  So if you are looking for a spicy snack that is fairly healthy, give these a try.

review/text: Regular salted almonds are okay but tend to be boring after awhile.  But Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds are just amazing.  I could eat an entire can in one sitting no problem, probably two cans.  I was tempted to give these nuts just 1 star because I'm afraid they're going to make me fat and broke!  FYI, I also tried the Wasabi & Soy Sauce almonds--absolutely no comparison, the Jalapeno Smokehouse blow them out of the water (at least to my taste buds).

review/text: These almonds are delicious. When you first start chewing, they taste like the plain Smokehouse brand. After a few seconds the Jalapeno heat kicks in. Not overwhelming but just enough to make the snack wanting you to eat a few more. Only bad part is that they are not available in the 38oz tub or jar like the Habanero BBQ flavor that is a better value. If you like them as I do, you can go through a 6oz can very quickly.

review/summary: Delicious with a punch!
review/text: I became hooked on these tasty tidbits, but after a while, I couldn't find them at my local stores anymore.  I tried Amazon and found I could order them in packs of six.  While the price is a little higher than I'd like, that is overridden by the fact that I can indeed get them, and they are delivered right to my door.  Ordering two packs gives me free shipping, too. These almonds are delicious by themselves, but when mixed with dark chocolate, they become irresistible.  The yummy recipe goes like this: take two almonds and one Hershey's dark chocolate kiss.  Pop the two almonds in your mouth and chew a little. Then pop in the chocolate kiss and chew, mixing the two together.  Sheer bliss!  I've become addicted and don't know what I'd do if these flavored almonds ever become unavailable.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

Almonds are a great, fun snack and having one that has a Lime Tart Flavor is absolutely Fabulous.  Even better is that Amazon delivers three full one pound packages for less than the price this item normally retails for in Stores, IF you can even get it in your favorite store.

review/text: I like lime and I like chili so I figured this would be a pretty tasty nut. It is definitely very flavorful but the lime overpowers the chili so much that the chili might as well be nonexistent. So if you are a lime lover you will probably enjoy this flavor, otherwise you might want to try one of the other varieties instead.  Personally I will finish up this batch but once they're gone I will go back to my habanero bbq and wasabi.

review/text: I love these almonds - they are the perfect snack, you don't need to eat a lot to feel satisfied. Also, since they have a lot of flavor, you feel "mouth-satisfied" as well. The wasabi is not too hot (actually I wish it were just a little hotter) and the soy just adds a little bit of saltiness. I recommend these if you like wasabi peas but want something with more nutritional value.
