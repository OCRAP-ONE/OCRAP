review/summary: Interesting chocolate from Vosges
review/text: I adore Vosges chocolate and am happy that Amazon carries some of their basic varieties that can be shipped via Prime. This bar has a slightly sweet, salty, nutty flavour, with quite a bit of texture from the nuts and coconut shreds. It's milkier than I normally prefer (I'm a 70-80% dark chocolate fan), but the taste makes up for it. If I'm not careful, I can eat an entire bar at one sitting! In their basic variety line (which includes Naga, Goji, Barcelona, Red Fire, Oaxaca, and Mo's Bacon Bars), this is my favourite. I've noticed recently that a couple of the bars were packaged with a 15% off online coupon, which I hope to use to purchase the varieties not available through Amazon Prime, like the Blood Orange/Hibiscus Caramel Bar and the Smoke & Stout Caramel Bar. Absolutely excellent chocolate, highly recommended for those connoisseurs out there!

review/text: Flahavan's is a fantastic steel cut oat.  I've tried the Quaker, Bob's Red Mill and the McCann's.  While they're all quite good, the Flahavan's seems to be cut a little bigger than the others, which gives them an extra crunchy and nutty taste.  I would highly recommend the Flahavan's.<br /><br />Plus, the metal tins are decorative and reusable.

review/summary: Good for cooking
review/text: We use this oil for cooking on the stove, "buttering" baking dishes, and in place of butter in many recipes. It's not strongly flavored, which works well for my purposes. It smells pleasant while heating up in a skillet but isn't otherwise strongly scented either. I like the wide opening of the jar and relatively flat sides. The necks on the taller, thinner jars tend to make scooping it out for use when it is solid rather difficult so this is my favorite jar for every day use.

review/summary: Best Wild Rice Ever
review/text: Having started cooking wild rice 20 plus years ago when I suppose it was just becoming widely available and the gourmet market was just beginning to open up, I know something about wild rice. Now, thanks to the internet, I don't have to travel to far off Minnesota or buy tiny expensive packets in the local health food cooperative. There's plenty of wild rice available for anyone who wants it these days, but as the demand has grown, the industry has changes. A lot of wild rice isn't really wild anymore. It's farmed in rice paddies. And a lot of wild rice is dried in industrial drums fueled by propane, much the same way coffee is roasted. You'll see a lot of dark black, hard rice sold as wild rice. Maybe that's all you've ever seen.<br /><br />Bineshii still does it the old fashioned way. The rice is wild, harvested by canoe, slow dried over a wood fire. The result is a flavorful, tender, ultra-long grain that has a light nut-brown color and a delicacy no other rice can match. It's so tender, you don't even need to cook it. You can soak it overnight in water and it will soak up enough water to become edible raw -- sort of like pasta al dente. It really comes into its glory when you cook it though, with wonderful curled sweet nutty grains that are so delicious I hate to serve it as a side dish. I usually just eat the rice and nothing else. That's how good it is!<br /><br />Bineshii is a group of Native Americans and they do more than just rice. They make preserves, soap, totems, kinnick kinnick, birch bark art pieces, and even have an instant mix Ojibwe fry bread, if you have a hankering. It's worth your while just to browse their website for a bit. The bottom line is that this is the best authentic wild rice I have found.

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: I've always been a huge fan of regular Jolly Ranchers. In fact, when I was in third grade our teacher used to give them to us as a treat, and ever since then I've been a big fan. I also love chewy candies, so when I saw these in a store I HAD to try them.<br /><br />WOW! YUM!!!!! These are delicious! I actually like them better than regular jolly ranchers. My mouth waters just thinking about them. They are pretty chewy, but I've got a bunch of fillings and several crowns, and none of them have been pulled out by eating these so I guess that's a good sign! I think they are soft enough to be enjoyable by most. They are definitely MUCH softer than say, caramels, for example! I think the flavor is greater in these than in regular jolly ranchers. It's like they are infused with more fruit flavor. They are delicious!<br /><br />After trying them in the store, I ordered these off of Amazon and I was in love! You get a pack of 12 bags, which is great for the price. I went on several trips recently and just grabbed a bag to take with me each time. My girlfriends and I enjoyed noshing on these on the airplanes and hotel rooms. :) They are so yummy and addicting.<br /><br />Great deal for the price!

I'm not even a pickle fan, and I still used to enjoy this product on occasion over the years.<br /><br />I hadn't bought it for several years, and just recently tried it again.  It is entirely different than it used to be - and it's awful now.<br /><br />Now, it is a can of mushy fat with some flecks of (presumably) ham mixed in.  It is much saltier and less pickle-flavored; actually the pickled ("deviled") flavoring is pretty much gone from the product now.<br /><br />As you can imagine, not only does it taste disgusting, it looks and smells disgusting.<br /><br />If you either have never tried it, or like me, you haven't had this product in a while, I strongly advise buying ONE can only at the grocery store first, before you commit to buying a whole pack of cans.

While the individual package should be air-sealed for freshness of this fried snack, the bottom half lost its air, and , the sweet smell of the snack, was everywhere.<br /><br />It looks like the Korean manufacturer overstacked the packaging boxes in their storage location or from shipping to burst the snack's tight air seal. I wish the packaging material is thicker not to collapse and the box size bigger to keep the snacks all air-tight, and not crushed from tight space all the way to US customers.<br /><br />The snack, itself is still fresh, hah!, from the broken packs,  as it is only 5 weeks old from original manufacturing date."w"<br /><br />______________<br /><br />The Chang-Gu snack is very well-known steady seller from decades of old days when there weren't many choices of snacks way before a supermaket type of shops were introduced in Korea. With clear coating, with some honey, on the fried loop-shape flour, with sprinkles of toasted black sesame seeds, it is savory and sweet snack that anyone can enjoy. This is my second best snack from Korea. The first is Mat-dongsan, of course!

review/summary: Very Lemon
review/text: If you like sour and you like lemon, you will like these.  They are sour and lemon and I can't think of anything better than a sour lemon treat to clear the moss from my nebula.  Fair price, nice package.  Lasts a decent amount of time as well, although the extreme intensity wears off as quickly as most.

review/summary: Pungent!
review/text: Normally, I love any mustard, as long as it isn't yellow.  That being said, this one is different.  For me, yellow mustard tastes chemical-y.  Not this one!  While I still prefer stone ground and dijon types of mustard, this one is welcome on my hot dogs.  The chemical flavor is replaced by an ultra-yellow flavor.  I've added it to such things as mac & cheese with flavorful results. The following is from their website:<br /><br />Located in Eastport, Maine - the nation's eastern-most city - Raye's Mustard Mill is North America's last remaining traditional stone-ground mustard mill.<br /><br />Four generations of the Raye family have been grinding mustard on the rock-bound coast of Maine since 1900, when 20-year old J. Wesley Raye, the son of a sea captain, founded the business in the family smokehouse to produce mustard for Maine's burgeoning sardine industry.<br /><br />In 1903, Wes moved the mill to its current location, allowing Raye's Mustard to be shipped out by both rail and by steamship.<br /><br />Today, the trains, steamships and all but one of Maine's sardine canneries are only a memory. But Raye's historic old stone mill, now a working museum, stands as a lasting testament to the quality and authenticity of a bygone era.<br /><br />The tenacious commitment of each succeeding generation of the Raye family has preserved that quality and authenticity even while adapting to the preferences of a changing world.<br /><br />While most modern mustards are either cooked or ground by high speed technology, Raye's maintains the traditional cold grind process that preserves the volatile taste qualities of the whole seeds, natural herbs and spices. The resulting flavor experience comes in part from the heightened awareness of taste as the mustard stimulates the taste buds.

review/summary: A Great Tasting Natural Mustard!
review/text: I regret to admit that I have had my jar of 'Down East Schooner' mustard in the pantry for about six weeks.  I have just opened and tasted then used in my kitchen today, and I simply love it!  I started with a dab on each of my cheese & wheat thins snacks.  After that, I used it on the burgers & onions I grilled on the barbie, super Tasty!  This mustard has a wonderful personality all its own.  I enjoy it right out of the jar.  Now the wife is not as avid a fan as I, but she will get hooked on it. It's just that good!

review/summary: The best candy on earth!
review/text: These peanut chews are addictive but very hard to find--Just Born needs to get its distribution act together.  They taste great--not too sweet, and the molasses in the caramel that binds the peanuts together really goes well with the dark/bittersweet chocolate coating.  They also have a great "mouth appeal" when you bite into them and then choose how you will savor each half.  I've tried the milk chocolate coated ones too, but they are not half as good.  Enjoy!

review/text: Notwithstanding the manufacturer's web site, I was unable find these in any local store.  My order from Amazon arrived with the candy fresh and in good shape.  But as other reviewers noted the recipe must have been changed.  The chewy part tended too be more like cardboard than caramel.  The peanuts did not have a fresh taste either.  This candy used to melt to a smooth, textured treat in the mouth.  Now it leaves a dry, papery feel.  The chocolate remains very good.  Since I can only have one a day, I was overall disappointed.

review/text: I am so happy to see that Horsetooth Hot Sauces are now available through Amazon.  My daughter has brought these down to me when she comes back to New Mexico from Colorado.  I've tried four of them, and they're all great, but Naughty #4 is my absolute favorite.<br /><br />I love this particular one, Naughty #4, because it has a very distictive sweet flavor.  It is also quite hot, as are all the sauces I've tried from this company, but I think it's the mango which gives it a cool sweet glow.  I love it on any cheese dish; enchiladas, casseroles, etc.  It really wakes up traditional foods; burgers, eggs, pizza, mac & cheese, & it's especially nice on an Italian sausage/provolone sub.  I also use it to make a dipping sauce with sour cream/garlic/lime.<br /><br />Well, you get the idea, love this sauce.  Thank you, Horsetooth and Amazon, for now making it so easy to order!

I had a taste for something but none of the typical potato or corn chips or chocolate bars. The popcorn chips with drizzled caramel sounded very tempting. They turned out to be even more delicious then I hoped they would be.<br />They are light and crispy chips that are made from pressed popped corn and then sealed with a combination taste of light salt and caramel.<br />I conveniently stopped at the same rest area on the return trip and there were no chips. I came looking for them here at Amazon, where they sell everything. I am very tempted and would spend the money on the product but can't justify the $11 shipping.<br />Definitely a taste you want to sample if you love crunch, sweet and popcorn.

As it is, I opted to buy hibiscus petals in bulk (you can get a pound of them for about the same price as this 4.6 ounce package) and make tea out of them instead.<br /><br />If the price isn't an issue for you, I would recommend this product.

review/summary: Smells one way, tastes another, but thankfully both are pretty good!
review/text: My boyfriend really wanted to try this blend as he has always enjoyed blueberry flavored coffees in the past. We picked up one of the sample packs of this blend from keurig's website to give it a try. I was skeptical about how a berry flavored coffee would translate when being brewed in the Keurig. Fortunately, though, the end result is very good, although not at all like either of us expected.<br /><br />From the moment this coffee begins brewing, the blueberry scent is unmistakeable. Very nice, but that had me worried that this coffee would have some sort of artificial sweetness to it. Thankfully, however, that isn't the case. While the scent may overpower you with the fragrance of fresh blueberries, the taste is a whole different thing altogether. The taste of this coffee is incredibly woodsy with a bit of a hint of cinnamon (very subtle in the latter). It's quite pleasing although totally unexpected.<br /><br />All in all my boyfriend even prefers this to the coffee shop blends, which speaks volumes in my book. I think it's great and I'm sure we'll restock it when our current supply of pods runs out.

This company is aware of the stigma behind products made in china but they're not going to bring their manufacturing to the US until consumers care enough about their dogs to stop buying this product.<br /><br />Per ABC News;<br />Just six months after issuing its latest warning about chicken jerky dog treats made in China, the Food and Drug Administration confirms it has logged more than 900 complaints from pet owners who say their dogs either were sickened or died after eating the treats.<br /><br />The number of complaints has nearly doubled since the story was first reported by ABC News in March. The FDA says its investigation is ongoing and that it continues to test samples of the popular treats, which dog owners across the country say have caused kidney failure in their pets, resulting in severe illness or death.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Good Cereal, But Nothing Like Cheerios
review/text: I bought this cereal after reading all the reviews on here about how great it is as a GF version of Cheerios. Cheerios were a staple in my house before I was diagnosed with CD. While Whole O's are good, the similarities between the two stop at shape. When I had my first bowl, it was a strange feeling because my eyes thought I was eating Cheerios, but i was tasting corn flakes. Whole O's are made from corn and rice, while Cheerios are more oat-based. The Whole O's are, in my opinion, exactly like Nature's Path's corn flakes, except a different shape.<br /><br />Whole O's are pretty high in fiber and low in sugar, taste fine and hold milk well. As a celiac, I definitely recommend them.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone.

review/text: I love Cheerios brand cereal with banana slices. I was looking for a gluten free cereal to replace the Cheerios. The texture of an O cereal is part of my banana/cereal experience. This cereal is a little too crunchy and sticks to my teeth when chewing. I use almond milk.<br /><br />I found the taste is important too.

review/summary: My Favorite Autumn (or any) tea thus far !!
review/text: Celestial Seasonings Sweet Harvest Pumpkin<br />Price I Paid: >$4/1 box(Free shipping due to amazon add-on)<br /><br />Caff-O-Meter: 30mg according to website<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Black Tea, Cinnamon, Ginger, Roasted Chicory, Natural Pumpkin Flavor With Other Natural Flavors (Soy Lecithin), Luo Han Guo, Cloves, Nutmeg, Natural Sweetener (Stevia Extract) and Pumpkin.<br /><br />This is the first time I have ever heard of Luo Han Guo, it is another (low/no cal) sweetener that appears to have been in use in the Asian province for years (what else are they hiding from us!). I would recommend taking some time to research it if you're interested, it makes many claims of benefits, but I am not informed enough to say whether or not they are true. Either way the use of this ingredient would not sway my purchase one way or the other unless the alternative was extremely high in g of sugar or made with the sweeteners known to cause issues.<br /><br />-Smell(5) - Amazing smell! This is my favorite smelling tea thus far, the reminiscent of fall is definitely in there, closely reminds me of Sweet potatoes when cooked and prepared but stronger.<br /><br />-Taste<br />+*Unsweetened:<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I (usually)add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average. However the sweetness in this stands out on its own as it contains sweetener extract therefore I am not going to give it the typical .5 compensation.<br />  Hot (5) - I have never come across a tea with such a naturally sweet flavor to it (likely attributed to the 2 natural sweeteners). I would be happy just drinking this hot with no sweetener (Iced is my preferred tea). Vanilla is the flavor that is standing out to me the most which is odd because its not listed, unless its under one of the natural flavors.<br />  Iced (4.5) - slightly thinner taste, this is likely attributed to the melting of the ice when I poured it over. The flavor is still sweet and taste is good I could easily drink this with no sweetener.<br /><br />+Sweetened<br />  Hot (4)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) almost makes it to sweet for me but the flavor is still there and it is still good. It definitely makes the artificial sweetener stand out.<br />  Iced (5) - WOW! Perfect! Gets me right in the mood for fall, so far this is the best tea I have ever had (flavored at least)<br /><br />-2nd Steep - (4) it weakens a little bit on the flavor but it still makes a great cup of tea, I didn't have try a 3rd steep but I would assume you could stretch it out to 3 maybe more. I did not deduct from this however because for a 2nd steep to still have as much flavor as it did is impressive<br /><br />Summary - A solid 5 star tea, This tea is possibly the best tea I have ever had, I would precaution you that I do like my items on the sweeter side, and this had the sweetness naturally (read above on Luo Han Guo). Some of you may find this too sweet or "fake" sweet, it appears the sweeteners are natural though from my limited research.<br /><br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp per 16 oz water) "steep" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference. I use plain lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.<br /><br /> I have many other teas for fall to try, so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea). And yes, I may have too much time on my hands.
