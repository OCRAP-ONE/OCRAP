review/summary: Good for Price
review/text: This kit is good for the price. It was easy to follow instruction. I love the fact that it included labels & corks. The wine has good taste, but does not have much body. I'll probly try some more kits from Vino Italiano, but will most likely make 5 gal instead 6.

review/summary: Great Experimental Wine
review/text: I think this wine is the best deal I've seen on Amazon. I've made several fruit wines from fresh fruit over the last couple of years, and wanted to try making a kit grape wine for some time. The $120 price tag on the premium kits are a bit steep for a first-timer. You can't beat the price on these Vino Italiano kits, and the corks alone retail for $7.50.<br />Following some suggestions for other Vito Italiano reds, I made mine to 5.25 gallons in the primary. I've racked mine at least 3 times so far, so I just add water to top them up during racking. I added 2 oz. oak chips for 3 weeks. At the latest racking, it still has good body and a strong, but young flavor. I'm looking forward to tasting this after a few months in the bottle.<br />Once I have a few of these made, I'll have the confidence to order a premium kit. Having these cheaper kits available will give the premium kit time to age out as well

review/text: I purchased 4 of these kits to make wine for my June wedding. I added oak chips as recommended from another review and "WOW" what a great tasting wine... Very, very happy and cant wait to try it once it ages a few months. I have the Tropical Riesling fermenting now and cant wait to try that as well. The corks, labels and shrink caps are great. Really impressed for the money and will be buying more of these for sure!!!!

review/summary: Not Healthy! HARDENED VEGATABLE FATS!
review/text: I purchased 2 packages of this coffee and was shocked when it arrived after I read the ingredients. Tongkat Ali is touted for its many health benefits.<br /><br />But this coffee has creamer made with "HARDENED VEGATABLE FATS (coconut, palm kernel Oil)" How could they put this terrible oil in what is supposed to be a healthy product? Do not buy this product if you are looking for health benefits. I also purchased from the same vendor 2 packages of their "Gold Choice Instant Tongkat Ali Ginseng Coffee" and it does not look any healthier with a "mixture HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE FATS". Why couldn't they let us put our own creamer in? Why did they have to ruin this coffee with terrible HARDENED VEGATABLE FATS?<br /><br />Also, I purchased several packs at one time because of the expensive shipping charges it made sense to get more packages and pay a little extra shipping. However, now I have to pay return shipping and an 18% restocking fee!<br /><br />I will remember this next time I am buying something that is supposed to be healthy yet they do not list the complete list of ingredients. They listed the good ingredients on the website but failed to mention the BAD ones!

review/summary: South Beach Diet Meal Bar, Chocolate Flavored, 5-Ct (Pack of 8)
review/text: South beach is a great protein bar and hard to find in stores, but AMAZON comes through as usual. Thanks to William Beaudin (WeSell4Less) for a day earlier delivery than estimated.  Small issue, but has to be noted, one of the 8 boxes of 5 is missing 2 bars and the box was in pristine, untampered with condition.  So should that cost William Beaudin a whole star, or any star, I don't think so. I am going with the "fluke theory" that there's no way for anyone to know this occurred but for possibly someone at the factory!  South Beach Diet Meal Bar, Chocolate Flavored, 5-Count (Pack of 8); I paid $48 / 40 bars = $1.20 each. $2.40 due back or 2 bars due here! Thanks, that's it. Signed, Sandbox (the MRS) for the guy buying.

review/summary: Expensive bars, but good content
review/text: I purchased the South Beach Diet Meal Bar, Chocolate flavored to try out different protein bards. It only has 12g of protein which is high for regular bars, but low compared to protein bars which have around 20g of protein. I like that it has 9g of fiber which should help me feel full. The calories are only 180. I'm not sure if this bar is suppose to replace a meal. The calories are extremely low as a meal replacement, but could work if it doesn't make me feel hungry afterward. I'll have to try that. I eat the meal bars as a snack. The flavor is crunchy, and decently good tasting for a protein bar. But it could taste better. The price for these bars are quite expensive so I probably won't buy these again.

review/text: Finally a vegan cookie that has flavor options and have some good, nutritional stuff in them. We've tried all of the flavors of these and they are all delicious. Pumpkin is my personal favorite.  My daughter's favorite is the lemon poppy, my husband the peanut butter and my son the chocolate/chocolate chip. We just buy them all now. :) We are vegan and there is no sign of animal products that we can find. These need to be split in two, but we love to share in our house anyway. I sometimes split mine in two and eat 1/2 with my coffee and then half for dessert later. They have so much fiber and protein in them, I'm surprised at how good they are.

Even after warming them up for 15 seconds, they were still hard, and just not enjoyable.  Normally I like these cookies, but for whatever reason, when I order them off Amazon, sometimes they come to me stale.  Definitely not getting these again, as it happens most often with the Double Chocolate and the Oatmeal Raisin.

I don't mind an occasional CRUNCH with my clam chowder, but with EVERY bit of clam? The taste is so bland (well of course - low sodium) I am giving the remaining cans to our local food bank. I am not even going to waste my time trying to "doctor it up." Weird that I feel guilty about donating food, but there it is.

review/summary: Yummy yummy yummy - this stuff's a honey!
review/text: Growing up in Georgia, I've eaten a lot of honey.  This stuff is awesome.  The Sourwood is my favorite; the honey has a really complex flavor that's of course sweet (after all, it IS honey) but much more mellow than many of the honeys I buy (such as Orange Blossom, even Wildflower).  I've been using it in a variety of teas (by the way, I love Teavana) and it's awesome.  This honey's addictive - I could eat it all day long (of course, I'd be bouncing off the walls, but at least I'd be happy!).<br /><br />I've bought this locally in Atlanta, but am so glad it's avaialable on Amazon as it's easier than hunting for it (usually only the higher-end stores carry it).

I can't really eat more at a time and fewer somehow falls short.  I finally found some in an Asian market in Florida for way cheaper than here... bummed at the price.  Still, you can't go wrong with these!  My wife hates 'em.

You will need a really hot oven to go with it.  I like "all purpose" better.  You may be better off with a "special" yeast as well.  I use Red Star and it just doesn't rise like I expect.  I don't need ten bags of any flour when I order anyway.  Try it, maybe you will like it better than me.  It is much better than whole wheat flour for pizza. 00 does okay. All purpose is better for pizza.

review/summary: Temptation Natural
review/text: I was really reluctant to give these treats to my cat. It's really important to me that she eats a very healthy diet, and while I'm not doing the raw food diet, I do scrutinize labels for meat by-products, BHA, and useless fillers. With that said, my cat couldn't care less for those "healthy" treats that had passed my inspection. I have a cupboard full of treats I felt comfortable giving her that she ended up saving so she could play with them later. So, out of desperation, I bought these; a treat is, after all, a treat. And she goes berserk over them. She's runs to the kitchen whenever I simply open a cupboard, hoping I'm about to give her one of her precious treats. I've also finally taught her to Come on command! And, to be honest, other treats (including this brand's regular treats) have a lot worse ingredients.

review/text: I have 4 cats and finding a treat that all of them will eat has been impossible for years.  I decided to try these, and every cat, including the finickiest of the 4, LOVES these treats.  I give each cat 2 of the treats in the morning, and they gobble them up.<br /><br />I gave these 5 stars because they serve their purpose well, which is making my cats think they're getting something special every day.  Keep in mind, these are not as healthy as some of the high end treats that contain no meal or by-products, so I don't want to mislead anyone on the health value.  Moderation and coupled with a high quality food, these make a nice little treat.<br /><br />Once these are gone, I will try some of the other flavors in the All Natural line; however, the Free Range Chicken Flavor will always be in my cupboard.  If you try these, I hope your cat(s) enjoys them as much as mine do.

review/text: spoiled little sensitive stomach shelter kittie, begs for these when the bag is first opened because the outside IS crunchy and theinside is creamy. He carefully studies his little cache of 3 or 4 and nibbles each one slowly, savoring w his eyes closed. He dropped one and with a petulant mew jumped down from his chair and went searching for it. He 'talks' to himself all the time, mewing and grunting if things are out whack...he couldnt find his little nibble so I pointed to it and he snatched it up like a greedy little thing. These treats are so loved and comforting, given along with Pet-Ease Paw Gel which I use for anxiety. This little guy was a litter runt and caged alone when I was at the shelter. These huge blue eyes and the worst smelling coast-he was sick and it seemed the vets had given up. He's a roly poly muscle bound little smarty pants now at 6 yrs and these treats keep his coat shiny and the paw gel keep him calm...if frustrated or bored he will shred paper or find some clear manner to show his upset.

review/summary: Definitely gets the cat - and human - seal of approval
review/text: I volunteer at a cat shelter so over time I've had some experience with what cats like and what they don't.  With a few rare exceptions, it is hard to find cat treats that are popular with mostly all of the cats.  So far, Natural Temptations Wild Alaskan Salmon Flavor, Natural Temptations Tuna Flavor and All Natural Temptations Chicken Flavor are proving to be three of the rare exceptions.  Just about all the kitties love these things and will follow me around when I'm handing them out so they can cadge more.  Because they are all natural and only 2 calories per treat, they are a reasonably safe and nutritious treat.  Because they are inexpensive, I can afford to bring enough for everybody at every visit!  And apparently they taste awesome.  I can buy these at my local grocery, Target, Walmart or pet store for around $1.50 to $2.00 a packet and each packet contains enough treats to provide every kitty in the shelter with a generous serving of treats. There is one negative - these treats contain a lot of grains and as a result some kitties will vomit them up after an hour (some kitties tummies will not tolerate food or treats containing grain, or more than very small amounts of grain); over the last few months I've had 3 or 4 kitties through the shelter with this issue.  Once I've identified a kitty who is grain-intolerant, I naturally do not feed it these treats or anything similar.  Note that there are several versions of the Whiskas treats that are not all natural; the kitties like them also but I prefer to feed the all natural version.

review/text: I have one cat who is addicted to these Temptation treats. Either the tuna of the salmon, I dont know what's in these little crunchy pillows, but he forsakes all food if he thinks there's any possibility I'll cave and slip him a few for being the cutest little meatball. His companion, a snooty long hair wont touch them and if he smells them on meatball's breath he gives him a swat for snacking between meals. So his coat seems very shiny, some months back he had flakiness which seemed to be dry skin, but the treats seem to have alleviated that. One thing I would caution is they're probably high in fat so offer them sparingly. (...right)

review/summary: Yes, but try this
review/text: The previous review, faulting the Campofrio lomo because of its hardness, is accurate, and I was at first equally disappointed. But I hit on the idea of microwaving a slice, much as one might microwave stale bread to soften it. This works! I microwave a slice (a little tough to cut, but I use a sharp knife and keep my fingers safe) on high heat for about seven seconds. It softens, becomes easily chewed, and the flavor comes out fully. I've become addicted!

review/summary: Very hard... but flavor is good
review/text: I had previously bought the Lomo Iberico which was approximately $80.<br /><br />I bought this one because it was a lot cheaper, and Campofrio is a known brand in Spain.<br /><br />I was disappointed because it was very hard which made it difficult to cut. Also, the lomo had a deep fold across the length of it (a small fold is normal), which coupled with the hard texture made it difficult to serve to guests (even the fat around the edges was hard).<br /><br />The flavor was good, but it was not excellent.<br /><br />Next time, I will buy the Iberico again. Yes, it's more expensive, but it's smoother, has better flavor, and a lot easier to cut and prepare for serving guests.

review/summary: Poor service ... Upgraded to not bad!
review/text: On June 16, 2011 I ordered 12 jars of the Bite back Tartar Sauce, and 6 jars of the Lemonaise. My account was charged immediately for the full amount. There was no communication from Taylor's, but about one week later I received a box with only the Lemonaise and a scribbled note saying that they would send the tartar sauce "when they could". I've heard nothing since.<br /><br />They listed this product as available when I ordered it, and it is still listed that way. And I'm still waiting for the jars I paid for weeks ago.<br /><br />As far as the product goes, I've had it before, and it's probably the best tartar sauce I've ever tasted. Now if I could only get my hands on some.<br /><br />Update: The Ecommerce Manager at Taylor's, Brian McNeil, heard about my problem with their service, contacted me and got it fixed right away (on Jul 4th!). He also credited my account with all shipping charges. I'm a happy camper.<br /><br />Now to make some crab cakes.

review/summary: Yummiest dark chocolate I've ever found!
review/text: I first tried Ritter Sport Fine Extra Dark at an airport in Amsterdam. It was smooth, almost creamy, not chalky like some dark chocolates. Although normally I prefer chocolate with a cacao percentage of 60-65%, this 71% bar lives up to its "Fine" designation and is extremely delicious and melts in your mouth the way milk chocolate does. I have tried many, many dark and bittersweet chocolates for eating out of hand (not baking), and this is by far my favorite. I searched for it in Phoenix when I returned home, and although many other flavors of Ritter Sport chocolate are widely available, not the Fine Extra Dark. I had to either drive 50 miles roundtrip to a specialty German bakery or find it online. Amazon offered the best price with (at the time) Prime shipping. I highly recommend this if you're a fan of dark chocolate.

review/text: Excellent quality and flavor. This chocolate has none of the fillers you will find with other off the shelf brands.<br />Buying these in bulk and storing them in a cool, dry place is the way to go.<br />Another nice feature is each square is perforated so you don't have to snap off chunks like some other bar type brands.<br />I look forward to trying other Ritter Sport varieties in the future.

review/summary: Fabulous New Product
review/text: Great new product, I have tried all 4 flavors... TROPICAL CITRUS; FRUIT PUNCH; ACAI, GRAPE POMEGRANATE and Energy PEACH GREEN TEA. I work in a high school and I am always getting sick. I have been drinking Vitamin Squeeze for several months now and HAVE NOT BEEN SICK ONCE...this is the only thing I have done differently! I don't like the taste of the tap water at the school, so this product is ideal for changing the tap water into a drink that is delicious and motivates me to drink more water. Finally, a truly great drink, which is much better than MIO and half the price of Vitaminwater! All it takes is a "little" squeeze for me. Vitamin Squeeze does not leave an aftertaste like some 0 calorie products. 0 calorie, 0 carbs, 0 sugar! Love it! My teens think the Tropical Citrus tastes like Tang or a Creamsicle. I am headed back to Safeway to get more! I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Pink peppercorns are the best.
review/text: Well worth the cost, pink peppercorns have sort of a sweetness to them.  I think I heard somewhere that is because they are not true peppercorns and are actually dried berries of some sort.  They have a great flavor on almost everything you would use pepper on, like steaks or chicken.<br /><br />They are great mixed with green and black peppercorns too of course, but sometimes you just want the flavor on its own.

review/text: Like other reviewers have pointed out, these are not sparkles. They just add a little shimmer. The flakes are large, not glittery. No taste or crunch either. They just kind of fall on icing and look like really thin shards of glass. Not pretty, just shiny purple.

review/text: These sparkles work very well as cake decor, but be aware that they have no taste.  They are edible, but I usually use decor that is sweet, or made of types of candy, and these were just there.  Don't worry, they're inoffensive!  You barely notice their existence, flavor and texture-wise.  They are just for pretty.  And for that, they're great!  The tiny bottle also gives you more glitter than you might think.  I glitterated 18 cupcakes with one half of one bottle.  A great deal!

review/text: I am Scots and I have used this product all my adult life.  It makes the best gravy ever and I use it in Scots recipes and any others that call for gravy.  It comes in power and granules.  I prefer the powder as do all the other people I have introduced to it.  I ordered 7 of these and they came in 2 boxes.  They were packaged so poorly one box had a hole in it's side and the other was so smooshed 1 box had been punctured and most of the powder had leaked from the box.  The company it was bought from did replace it immediately.  I was very angry because you have to pay shipping on each item (so 7 x shipping costs) even although they came from the same location and in only 2 boxes.  There was only 1 strip of tape around the boxes closing them and they had come loose on top.  I have not had packaging problems with other products I have ordered from the UK.  Fantastic product - gggggggggggggggreat taste!!!  I usually buy Bisto in a British shop here but they are having trouble getting it from their supplier so that's why I was willing to pay such a high price for it.  I'll never do it again.

review/text: My two border collies can eat through 10-inch "rawhide rolls" in one evening (that's one bone per dog). That gets expensive! These 24-inch bones with knotted ends are a better deal. I give one to each of my two dogs and the bones last 3 weeks. I ordered these at the end of September. Noticed the Amazon price went up by $1.72 per bone in October. Not happy with the price jump, but it's still a better deal than the 10-inch bones.

review/text: I bought this 24" rawhide because several reviewers said their dogs worked on it for a very long time.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with my 100 lb. Labrodane.  He was pulling off large shreds within 2 minutes, had it broken in half within 10 minutes and chewed one half down to the knot in less than an hour.  While I don't think this is a bad quality bone, the rawhide is not as thick as other bones I have purchased, which I am assuming is why he was able to tear it apart so fast.

review/text: My 45 lb lab mix loves these 24" rawhide bones but they only last 48 hours at best. She's like a wood chipper when she gets going. So according to her it is a 5 star product based on how much she loves it. But in my judgement it is sort of expensive for 2 days of chewing. I will buy this product occasionally but will seek a more economical alternative. My guess is that most dogs will not chew it up as quickly.
