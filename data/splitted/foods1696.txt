review/summary: Attractive packaging, but doesn't taste nearly as good as Orangina.
review/text: Pros: Attractive, colorful, retro-style packaging.<br />  Not too sweet.<br />  No high fructose corn syrup, and natural ingredients<br /><br />Cons:  Small portions<br />  Use of primarily "cheaper" juice concentrates<br />  Carbonation unnecessary, and too mild<br /><br />I wasn't particularly crazy about the clementine flavor of Izze juice.  There is certainly a large health craze for "fortified" natural juices these days, and Izze is another entry.  However, in my opinion, it's not a strong contender.<br /><br />The packaging is attractive, and I like the tasteful use of bright colors and retro designs.  The can is on the slim size, with just 8.4 oz per serving.  That's much smaller than Arizona or even Coke, and that would be fine if the juice itself were fantastic, but it's not.  For the price, it seems a little small.<br /><br />As to taste, there is mild carbonation, which is so mild, they shouldn't have bothered adding it in the first place.  As for the clementine flavor, it tasted like a very watered down orange juice, or Orangina.  I know why- I checked the ingredients, there's not much orange juice in there.  It's mainly cheaper juice concentrates, such as apple or grape juice.  Same goes for the pomegranate flavor- mainly cranberry and grape juice.<br /><br />I did appreciate that they used natural juice concentrates, and did not use any high fructose corn syrup, but the use of other blends of juice really destroyed the taste for me.<br /><br />In conclusion- I wouldn't buy this product.  It's at least $1 for an 8 oz can (that's $1 for one cup), and I'd rather just drink a cup of orange juice for cheaper, naturally fortified with many more vitamins and minerals.

review/summary: IZZE: An interesting alternative to soda
review/text: With Summer right around the corner, I am looking forward to sitting outside, relaxing, and sipping some orange crush soda. Being someone who is health conscious, I only drink soda on rare occasions, because of the sugar. I also limit my soda consumption because of the caffeine, which sometimes triggers small migraine headaches.<br /><br />Izze is a great alternative, as it contains no refined sugars or caffeine. Also, unlike typical soft drinks, Izze actually contains a few vitamins (10 percent DV of Vitamin C, B6, Niacin in a 8.4 oz can).<br /><br />Yes, IZZE sparkling clementine does taste different than the average orange soda's with caffeine and sugar. I like the taste, but I have to admit that you have to let it grow on you. I had to drink a few, before I really began to like the taste. Izze does lack the sweetness of soda, but I actually find it more refreshing.<br /><br />One thing I didn't like was that IZZE sparkling clementine doesn't contain any clementine (a little strange for a product that promotes itself as natural and holy). Contains white grape, apple, lemon and orange juice.

review/summary: Tasty and Better than Soda
review/text: This is a very refreshing and flavorful fruit beverage, healthier than soda or even most other fruit drinks: no high fructose corn syrup, not even any refined sugars.  It's basically just fruit juice (70%) and sparkling water, with a few additives, and it contains vitamins C, B6 and niacin.  The slim can design makes it easy to carry or pack in lunches.  As for the flavor, it's not overly sweet - a bit tart, actually, although I couldn't tell if it contained actual clementine orange juice (it does have grape, apple, lemon and orange concentrates, so those combined must give it the "clementine" flavor). It reminds me of two very good orange soft drinks I've had in Europe, Tango and Orangina, and it compares favorably with both.  I'm eager now to try their other flavors.

review/summary: Not bad but not that great either
review/text: Up until now, I have never tried any of Izze's all natural sparkling juice products. I recently decided to try one of the sparkling juices, namely the clementine flavor. According to Izze, there is no caffeine, no preservatives, and contains 70% pure fruit juice with a hint of sparkling water and fortified with vitamins. There definitely is a clementine flavor to the water. It is a bit tart. Unfortunately the clementine flavor isn't authentic. The first thing I saw on the back of the can is that the juice was made from white grape, apple, lemon, and orange. So really the title of the flavored water is a bit misleading. As for the vitamins, according to the ingrediants, there is only 10% of vitamin c and vitamin B6. 10% isn't something to crow about but I guess in the world of bottled water, I suppose it is. All in all, Izze Sparkling Clementine is a nice, refreshing alternative to soda.

review/summary: Wow! This Clementine flavor is really good!
review/text: I'm not a big fan of designer water or the trick caffiene drinks (ala Red Bull). I think they're a waste of money.<br /><br />I really like this IZZE clementine drink. It's a combination of juice and sparking water that really has a refreshing taste. The clementine taste isn't sickeningly sweet, but it's also not faint as with those flavored waters. It has a small to moderate amount of sugar in it, but since its base is real juice (grape and clementine), it's not a bad thing. It doesn't taste like a soda, but it also doesn't taste like a "water". It's unique. I really like it.<br /><br />It's 8.4 ozs, which means it truly is a single serving as opposed to the 12 oz cans of sodas we're used to. It's a cute can that seems designed to hold the juice securely, but seems to somehow do so using a bit less aluminum than a typical can (when empty, if feels lighter...?)<br /><br />Anyway, I like this drink. I will be purchasing it as it comes available. I only hope that its price isn't a high designer one.

review/summary: good alternative to soda
review/text: Sweet (maybe a tad too sweet), with a pleasant citrusy flavor, this beverage would be great to serve at kid's parties or at a barbecue instead of regular soda - the ingredient list is certainly less scary and afterall a sparkling water-and-fruit juice drink is obviously better than one loaded with refined sugar (or even worse, artificial sweeteners), caffeine and chemical addtitives.<br /><br />While this isn't a healthy drink, it would be a great improvement for a regular soda drinker to switch to this instead - the improvement may not show in calories but it will show in general health: the lack of caffeine and lower sugar content will avoid calcium loss so common in regular soda drinkers, and your liver will appreciate the lack of highly processed chemical additives.<br /><br />I'm not a soda drinker but I will keep this in the fridge to offer to guests or serve to my next barbecue party.

review/summary: Sparkling Clementine
review/text: It's 70% juice.  The clementine flavor includes white grape, apple, lemon and orange juice concentrates.  No clementine.  I like it even though I hate white grape and apple juice.  The mixture comes out tasting like orange soda but not quite as sweet.  My nephew liked it even though he usually likes to sweeten his drinks to the consistency of "syrup."  Each can is 8.4 oz instead of the larger serving sizes that one is used to getting.  There are 80 calories in a can.  I can see how parents would prefer to serve these to their kids rather than regular sodas.  It has no caffeine, preservatives, or refined sugars, and its fortified with vitamins.  I'd recommend trying a can to see if you like the taste before committing to purchasing a case.

review/summary: Half-Pint Thirst Quencher
review/text: Izze's Clementine sparkling juice beverage is just right! It's the right size at 8.4 ounces. It's the right sweetness - a nice tart drink that doesn't make you feel like you've just drank a can of syrup on a hot summer day. The carbonation is just right, not too much. Above all, it's a great thirst quencher! You might think that a half-pint wouldn't be enough to satisfy your thirst, but it does - and without filling you up like soda pop can do. The only reason I didn't give this drink 5 stars is because it does have a lot of sugar in it. This helps boost your energy, but it isn't good for those watching their weight. A "diet" version would easily garner the full five stars.

review/text: Izze All Natural Sparkling Clementine juice would be a wonderful refreshment on a hot day. This product quite tart and much less sweet than a juice-type energy drink, which is much better in my book. It has just a touch of carbonation and comes in a nicely sized can.<br /><br />I was somewhat disappointed, however, that the "natural juices" mentioned were white grape, apple, and orange...no clementine juice, just "natural flavor." Oh well.<br /><br />Nonetheless I would be interested to try the other flavors in this line.

review/summary: Delicious and light - a good size too!
review/text: Want a carbonated soft drink, but not the phosophoric acid, high-frucose corn syrup, and artificial caramel coloring? Sometimes I do, and this nice little drink gave me just what i was looking for.<br /><br />It tastes a bit like Orangina, but more fizz and no pulp. It's comprized mostly of juices and sparkling water. It's been "fortified" with a number of vitamins. Certainly it's a healthier alternative to most popular soft drinks.<br /><br />It comes in an 8 oz can which will actually fit in your pocket. I find the size perfect.<br /><br />Don't confuse this with a diet drink, however, as fruit juice is still high in carbohydrate. It doesn't contain refined sugar though, so it's probably better than drinking a Coke.<br /><br />My wife and I liked it so much, we went through a case in about a week and a half.

review/summary: Wonderful Dog Food
review/text: A recently deceased friend told me about this food, Canadae Platinum.  He fed his "boys" both the dry and the canned.  His boys are a German Spitz and a Bichon Frise, 4/14 years old respectively.  Doug said that after less than two weeks, the 14 year old was like a "new dog".<br /><br />I now have his dogs, fullfilling a promise, added to our Doxy and Shiba Inu ( 5/7 years respectively), three cats and 7 birds.  All the dogs are now on this Canadae Platinum dry food and love it.  While they used to pick at their old food, they dive into this.  They also seem to get satiated faster, so they actually leave a little in the bowls.<br /><br />The Glucosamine/Chondroitin is the key for the older dog.  A vet once recommended it for an older dog we used to have years ago.  When I started taking it for my arthritic ankles, I was soon able to stop taking anti-inflamatories like Daypro.  I've since found out that the medical establishment considers GC to be useless.  All I can say is that it works for me, and within a few weeks of re-starting Little Boy ( the 14 year old) on this food with GC, he runs, plays and jumps with the rest of the dogs like a puppy.<br /><br />There are a few places in Las Vegas selling this food, all "high-end" pet food stores and all slightly more expensive.  The convenience of one-click and having the food on my doorstep in a day or two is even better than the savings.<br /><br />We've also moved our cats over to Felidae (the feline version of Canadae) with similar results.

I had some problems in the past when it appeared that Canidae reformulated this particular food and I ended up switching to another brand.  I was never happy with the other brand, and after about a year off from Canidae, I gave them another try.  The food was back to the former formula and my dogs loved it (and still do).  I'm happy that this senior formula has Glucosamine as a supplement.  Overall, aside from the reformulation issue, I'm a happy Canidae customer and my dogs are happy Canidae dogs!

review/summary: My dog looks amazing!
review/text: Because of the price, I decided to only feed this to my oldest (and only overweight) dog (out of 3 dogs).  She looks so good and still has a lot of youth and energy.  I adopted all of them, but I believe she is about 11.  I haven't weighed her, but she has visibly lost weight after 2/3 of the bag!  I'm guessing she has gone from 90 to 85 pounds in about 3 weeks, which is incredible.  I read a lot of good things online about the ingredients of this and a few other premium foods.  We will certainly continue with this if we can afford it; it's actually a great value if you have Prime; which is worth it if you're going to be ordering heavy items such as this.

review/summary: LadyBug Likes it
review/text: Ok, to be fair LadyBug likes anything edible.  :)  Which was part of the problem....  Lady is a older (11-14 yr.) std. American Eskimo who loves to  eat that I inherited from my Grandmother.  She got up to 42 lbs on her previous diet dog food and the vet wants her to be 35.  That means she was overweight by 20%  &lt;cringe>.  So I discovered this food and after &lt;6 months, she is 36 lbs.  She likes the food and once she adjusted to the smaller quantity of food, found it to be quite filling.  Our Bear (6 yr. Great Pyrenees / Border Collie mix) sometimes steals Lady's food instead of eating her own.  I'll probably move Bear over to this dog food next year.  I should probably note that as old as Lady is, she acts like a young dog...  even though she is losing her sight slowly.

review/summary: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: Paradise Tropical Tea
review/text: "Paradise Tropical Tea" is a brand name, not a description of the tea itself.  China Black, as per description, is the tea type itself. This tea is a good strong black tea that makes an excellent iced tea.  I have tried the "tropical" and it is OK if one likes flavored drinks.  I prefer the basic. I have been using this tea for several years and would be very disappointed if I had to make a change in brands.  I used to buy it by the case at my local coffee shop, but their distributor quit handling it.  So now I am here at Amazon.<br />  My recipe for "Espresso" tea is as follows. 2 pouches of tea in the carafe of a coffee maker and put in 4 cups of water per bag in the reservoir and hit start.  Let stand 5 minutes then remove pouches.  Then I put the tea in the fridge.  To serve, I mix a ratio of tea to water according to my currant needs and taste. A couple of shots of tea to a glass of water.

review/summary: Orange and dark chocolate...yum...
review/text: One of my favorite flavor combinations is orange and dark chocolate. I saw these on my grocery store shelf one day & decided to give them a try.  I wasn't totally sure of what I was getting. The word 'biscuit' confused me, but I'd heard that the British use that word for cookie.  The biscuit is more of a soft cookie about 1/4" thick; it's topped with a stiff orange jelly & iced with a thin layer of dark chocolate icing. One of these cookies will satisfy my craving. I tried the raspberry flavor, but prefer the orange.<br /><br />Serving Size: 2<br />Servings per 5.29 oz Container: 6<br />Calories: 100<br />Total Fat: 3 g<br />~Saturated Fat: 1.5g<br />~Trans Fat: 0<br />Cholesterol: 10mg<br />Sodium: 35mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 17 g<br />Dietary Fiber: 0<br />Sugars: 14g<br />Protein: &lt;1g<br /><br />Ingredients listed on product page under Important Information<br />Made in Belgium

review/summary: Great little dessert cookie, or "chocolate and orange, together at last"
review/text: My late father's favorite flavor combination was orange and chocolate. His confection of choice was candied orange peel covered in dark chocolate. When he passed away in his 80's we found a small stash of chocolate-covered orange jellies in the cupboard--his treat. He'd have LOVED this cookies. They are soft sponge biscuits with a layer of stiff orange jelly and a brittle dark chocolate topping. The combination is delectable--the soft biscuit, orangey jelly and the crackle of the bitter chocolate on top. A few of these make a great dessert with a cup of espresso. They come in raspberry flavor as well, which I tried and it's also absolutely terrific. So keep a tube of these on hand and if required to produce a dessert or afternoon refreshment for a sudden visitor, make a cup of coffee and put a few of these on a nice paper doily. Done.

review/summary: I've loved them since i was a child
review/text: I've been eating these Belgian cookies since i was a child growing up in Belgium.  They're a very old cookie called Couques de Bastogne (Bastogne cookies, from the town where the Battle of the Bulge took place). They were first marketed in the U.S. under that name but since that didn't mean  much to Americans the name's been changed several times over the 20 or so years I've seen them around. My local grocery store (I live in the Rockies) was carrying them, then Nabisco took over the LU brand and quit carrying the Bastogne here.  I just bought several boxes in NYC at a deli next to Time Square and really wanted more.  So happy to have found them on Amazon.<br /><br />They're a bit sweet, that's true, and that is a bit unusual for a European cookie but they make the best dunking cookie: cold milk, coffee of hot chocolate. They're similar to the the Lotus cinnamon cookie also made in Belgium that Delta serves on its flights. sorry the name escapes me.  I prefer the texture of the Cinnamon Sugar Spice; it's lighter.

review/summary: Buy Them Off the Shelf
review/text: For years, the only Lu's I could find at my local market were the USA Lu's, which aren't as good as the Belgium biscuits.  So, I was happy to find them at Amazon this past July, 2012 and bought the case of six boxes.  Unfortunately, they didn't taste fresh and had an expiration date of Dec. 2012; that explained the stale taste, but I chose not to return them.  Instead, I nuke two in the microwave for 5 or 6 seconds and it sort of revives the flavor.<br /><br />Well, last week, Sept. 14, 2012, I found the Belgium Lu at my local supermarket and bought a single box.  That box expires Dec. 2013, over a year from now, and the cookies definitely taste better.  Moral of the story: Buy them where you can read the Expiration date.  I surmise that having a year or two shelf life should be about right.

review/summary: PIMS ORANGE
review/text: This is the second (and last) time in a few years that I buy Pim's Orange from Amazon. Like the first time, I was disappointed, not because of the cookie itself, which is normally delicious--as a French person, I am very familiar with PIM'S cookies and know what they should taste and look like--, but because of the improper manner in which the packages are stored and handled along the way (I cannot figure out at which end). Obviously, the packages go from cold to hot temperatures (or vice versa), possibly multiple times, which is the worst thing that can happen to cookies incorporating chocolate and filling: this alters their appearance and consistency--chocolate surface becomes discolored and collapses due to melting before regaining some firmness, and the cookie part and filling become too soft. The taste is not affected too badly, but you cannot serve them to guests, because of the cookies' miserable appearence.  In order to save them anyway for my own consumption, I wrap the individual packs in a bath towel and store them in the vegetable compartment of my refrigerator. That helps regain some firmness in the cookies, but of course the chocolate surface remains discolored. So my advice is:  buy individual packs at your grocery store if they carry PIM'S, because the cookies are normally delicious, but do not buy them from Amazon.  It's too bad that Amazon has done nothing so far to correct this storage problem. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, to my satisfaction 99 p.100 of the time, including LU "Petit Beurre" cookies (these are rarely available in US grocery stores). Since they include no chocolate or filling, the shipments are usually in perfect condition.  I give PIM,S Orange three stars because the product is excellent under normal conditions, and the problem is not caused by the manufacturer.

review/summary: Petit Beurre Biscuits
review/text: Lu Petit Beurre are the best biscuits of their type I have tasted and compare very favorably with the English brands of Petit Beurre. They are crisp and firm and have a great flavor without being too sweet or buttery. A superb accompaniment to a cup of tea. May this long established French company, now a division of Kraft Foods, keep up their good work making great products.

review/summary: not too sweet, just right
review/text: i personally enjoy this tea biscuit since it is not too sweet (like a cookie), and not like a cracker.  I enjoy with tea - either when I am driving to work early in the morning, or when I want a snack.  It is great to keep a package at work or in the car for a quick treat without too many calories.  It satisfies me until the next meal.

review/summary: Not really a biscuit/cookie
review/text: These "soft biscuits" are less like biscuits/cookies and more like really really dense cake. It was quite a surprise when I first tried one because I was expecting something similar to the soft cookies you buy in the grocery store. Never the less, the taste is very good with the raspberry filling being nicely complemented by the dark chocolate.<br /><br />The flavor is nice but the cookie part was too odd for me so I won't be buying this again. Still, I think there are probably a lot of people who would enjoy this product and if you like raspberry and dark chocolate you may want to give it a try.

review/text: These shortbread cookies are amazing. They are made of only 4 simple ingredients (wheat flour, butter, sugar, and salt), and they taste heavenly. If you made these cookies yourself, at home, you would use the same ingredients. There is nothing artificial added.<br /><br />Besides all of that, they are crispy, very satisfying and not too sweet. My grandchildren love them as much as I do. If you like shortbread, you will love these cookies. If you haven't tried shortbread cookies, I suggest you give these a try and start with the best, right from the Scottish Highlands.

review/text: The ajvar is a traditional spread made in my country, but since i am in the US its very hard to find anything similar to it.  First i was thinking of having some sent from back home, since they make it every single year at the end of the summer, but because of postal restrictions when it comes to sending items from organic origin, that idea is impossible to put into practice.  Finding this product online made it quite easier for me.  It may not be like our home-made one, but its pretty close, and that is good enough for me.<br />Biljana is a manufacturer who is famous for making this spreads and it is one of those who do a good job at it.<br /><br />All on all, i will be getting more from this seller and from this brand, and yes, i would recommend it to those who like to try vegetables spreads.<br /><br />Very pleased with the product, and the seller because it came on time and well packed.

Mild yet distinctive in character with a fine finish(the aftertaste in the mouth after you swallow.)<br /><br />On a recent visit to Costa Rica, My wife and I visited a Britt coffee plantation. On a very well prepared tour, we were shown the origen and migration of coffee cultivation. In addition we were shown what makes a great coffee, great. 100% Arabica beens grown at high altitude plantations whose soil contains volcanic ash.<br /><br />The roasts were explained in the following terms;<br /><br />Light Roast, the smooth tasting coffee with the greatest caffein content. Tastes similar to Chock Full o' Nuts coffee.<br /><br />Medium Roast, more full bodied.<br /><br />Dark Roast, Stronger taste similar to many after dinner coffees.<br /><br />French Roast, stronger yet, fullbodied as you would find at retail coffee shops .

review/text: I purchased a pound of this and a pound of the dark roast variety to see how they compared. I am a big fan of Costa Rican coffee and have to say that this light roast bean from Cafe Britt is the way to go. The crisp, citrusy flavor is more pronounced in this lighter roast than it is in the dark roast version. I generally found the flavors here to be more balanced all the way around with a cleaner, more vibrant finish. This is a solid morning coffee with plenty of caffeine to keep you going, but the acidity - hard to avoid in Costa Rican coffees - is not to a level that will make you regret drinking it later. I can drink a lot of this coffee and still crave it later in the day. If you're on the fence about which Costa Rican coffee to buy, I highly recommend this one.

review/summary: Bread Baking with Sprouted Whole Grains
review/text: I purchased this on a whim due to the frustration with finding affordable sprouted grain breads and pastas.  I put four cups of this, a cup of lentils and a cup of quinoa into a plastic tub, soaked it over night in water, then drained and rinsed out a couple times a day - by day 3 all the wheat had sprouted!  It was far more successful than I had even hoped!<br /><br />I've done this twice with great luck both times.  I will order from them again.<br /><br />Sprouted Grain Bread Recipe:<br />Sprout grain until sprout is 1/4 to 1/2 inch long, grind in meat or grain grinder (I used a meat grinder and ran it through twice).  Shape doughy ground output into a loaf and bake in a warm oven (250F) for 2 1/2 hours.  No yeast, no flour no water - just grain and heat!  It is dense of course but SO DELICIOUS!  I also made a loaf where I added yeast to the grinding process then mixed in a little water and flour - this loaf did rise in a warm oven and baked faster (due to the air) and was a more traditional style loaf.<br /><br />I'm planning on making cereal since the crust tastes every bit as good as grape-nuts and is much much healthier!  I'll do as above but spread the dough across a cookie sheet and score it with a pizza cutter.  I anticipate it will be a lovely addition to my morning yogurt!<br /><br />You can follow my crazy adventures in eating through my @HonestOmnivore account on Twitter - I'm trying to raise, forage and hunt for as much of my food as I can.

review/summary: So far so good...
review/text: I used to grow wheatgrass just for my cats but have since started juicing it for myself. I have had good results so far with this manufacturer.<br /><br />I sprout my wheatgrass in soaking trays and transfer it to plates when it's too big for its container. This type seems to start sprouting more slowly than other wheatgrass seeds I have sprouted in the past, including commercially available "cat" grass which I found to be chemically treated. I wonder if the chemicals affect the speed of sprouting. It takes maybe five days for this variety to be ready for plate growing, as opposed to three or so of the other brand. However, patience seems to pay off - in return for a lengthier sprouting time, this grass seems tastier than others I have had - almost sweet. Its stems are hardy and don't 'flop' over. When I juice the leaves I get results similar to buying a wheatgrass shot at WholeFoods - tasty, so I believe the manufacturer's "chemical free" labeling. Chemically grown wheatgrass is known to taste distinctly bad. I have also taken to using the young sprouts in salads because of their sweet taste.<br /><br />Another reviewer said this product was "hard" - I'm not sure in what way, unless there is some other growing method which isn't encouraged by the slow start to germination I have experienced. With patience, normal tray sprouting seems to work fine for me, and I have yet to encounter a non-germinating seed in the dozen or so batches I've tried so far. 12/31/11

NO one could believe how bright green and beautifully formed the plant was.  The fact that it had spent a few days in a sealed box was doubly mystifying!  This birthday present was paraded up an down the halls of our office building before it ever made it home to my husband.  Everyone was amazed.  Thank you for a great birthday surprise.

The instruction pamphlet that came with the tree was not especially thorough, giving only the bare necessities, so I ended getting several books and videos from the library to teach me all the extra details and essentials.  I recommend buying at least one book of instructions, and I have found that the "Complete Guide to Bonsai" by Harry Tomlinson is the best out there.  The plant is doing wonderfully though, thriving in my window, and it even has new growth on it!  I smile every time I look at it.  For someone who was afraid she would kill the plant like I have done with several others, this one is doing great!  I am so encouraged I want to go out and get several more bonsai, and may even grow my own!  Great tree for a beginner.  Good luck!<br /><br />Update:  Four months later and the tree is flourishing!  There has been so much new growth that I have started my own jade forest from the pruned leaves!  I even gave a cutting to my friend and she is having great success as well.  This has been the most wonderful little tree, and has gotten me so interested in bonsai that I now have several other kinds of trees as well.  As long as you keep it watered and occasionally fertilize the tree, you will have a happy, healthy, beautiful little plant on your hands!  I still definitely recommend this tree, especially to beginners.  Happy planting!

review/summary: Beautiful Dorm Decoration
review/text: I bought this bonsai tree to decorate my dorm room at college and I honestly wasn't expecting much considering it would be shipped in a box. It came to my dorm in 2 days which was unexpected and packed very carefully. Its really a great decoration for the room and really adapts well to the environment.

review/summary: Thrips Infestation!
review/text: My bonsai seemed fine for about a week, and then it started dropping leaves, just like all the others'. Unlike everyone else who's posted here, I found out why. I watered and inspected the tree and found little (.5mm) silver mites running around in the soil-- lots of them.<br />I did a lot of research and then eventually took it to a local nursery where they said and my bonsai came with a nice little infestation of thrips palmi.<br />Thrips are a common glasshouse and factory nursery infestation that attack the roots of young plants. To an adult plant, thrips themselves do minimal damage even in large numbers but can stunt or warp growth by feeding on terminal shoots, the undersides of leaves, causing them to drop. Each of my dropped jade leaves had a small brown spot at the base where thrips had been feeding. The real danger from thrips is that they carry Watermelon silver mottle virus that makes your leaves turn silver and shrivel up.<br /><br />The reason the leaves start dropping is that thrips love the warm dry air of a house or apartment and the parasite population explodes when you house the plant indoors as advertised.<br /><br />Anyway, in summary, they mention they are the biggest US distributor of bonsai, and I believe them, 'cause my bonsai has the parasites to prove it! DO NOT BUY!

review/summary: Water pot that's not
review/text: The tree came well packaged and is healthy so far.  The water pot is nice to have but there's no mention that there are root holes in the bottom for water to leak out.  A water tray is still required and should be mentioned to keep novices like myself from little accidents like I had all over my desk.

review/summary: couldnt be happier
review/text: plant arrived very much on time. packaged very well.  no damage. and it stil looks great almost a month later. lots of new growth.  looks exactly like the picture, maybe even a little better.<br /><br />UPDATE>>>>2 years later. I have managed to throw everything possible at this poor little plant in an inadvertent attempt to kill it. It dropped ALL of the leaves about a year ago (due to under or over watering) but has bounced back nicely. Still hanging in there even if it isn't quite as nice as it was.<br /><br />UPDATE  1/3/11>>>> this thing is still alive and kickin. it never fully recovered from the earlier abuse, but oh well.

review/summary: The Bugs arrived with this tree
review/text: I started noticing little bugs flying thru my home almost immediately after receiving this tree but didn't make the connection right away. After the window near the tree started crawling with bugs, I was forced to throw this tree out. Now that I no longer have the tree in the house, there are hundreds of dead bugs to deal with! One of the worst purchases ever.
