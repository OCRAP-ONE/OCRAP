review/text: We didn't care for the taste of Cafe Escapes Hot Chocolate as much as the Grove Square brand. It had a slight artificial taste to it. It also left an aftertaste in my mouth. It is way more expensive than the other brand. We'll drink them, but I won't be buying this brand/flavor again.

review/summary: Servicable but still mediocre
review/text: Palatable for kids but that's about the best I can say about them.  On par with the more mediocre generic instant hot chocolates, but at the cost per cup for these should be much better.  Making a 4oz cup and bolstering the flavor with 2% milk is required even to get a child to drink them.  My advice is to pick up an alternative brand's seasonal premium hot chocolate for the K-cup makers and skip this Green Mountain/Cafe Escapes variety- as these are disappointing at best.<br /><br />Avoid if possible, but not a total waste.  Consider my 2 stars as "generous."

review/text: The key to enjoyment with these:  Use a keurig that has a small/large cup setting. Microwave/stove-top heat a 3rd of what you want to drink of milk to a boil. Put the milk in the mug, and brew the hot chocolate directly into it. Top with whipped cream.<br /><br />IF you drink it this way, its perfect, otherwise there's a slight after taste(just like every other cocoa mix if you ask me).

review/summary: Great Milk Choclate, Hot Cocoa
review/text: I love chocolate everything and have purchased and used three brands of hot cocoa, from Amazon, in our Keurig K-cup brewer which was a 2011 Christmas gift. The best milk chocolate flavor consumed was Cafe Escapes followed by Grove Square and totally unacceptable Green Mountain Coffee, Hot cocoa, which went to our local refuse hauler. I feel that you get what you pay for as Cafe Escapes was the highest cost and Green Mountain the cheapest and worst. I noticed that both Cafe Escapes and Grove Square were labeled Milk chocolate flavor,Hot Cocoa, Green Mountain was not which may account for it's strange flavor. I wish there was a means of securing product samples rather than purchasing two boxes of some products like green Mountain.

review/summary: Flavor is ok, but watch out for the aluminum!
review/text: We have only had the Keurig coffee maker for a couple of months (yes, it was a Christmas gift) and my wife is the main user.  So, it's possible that the problem I'm having is common to other coffee/hot chocolate cups in addition to these Cafe Escapes.  At any rate, unlike many of the other reviewers, I think the hot chocolate flavor is pretty good.  My problem is that at least half the time I find a tiny piece of aluminum -- sometimes two tiny pieces -- floating on top of the chocolate in the cup.  The Keurig works, of course, by punching a small hole in the chocolate/coffee container.  I assume the tiny piece of aluminum is from the whole punched in the container.  I would guess that if the cups were properly designed, this wouldn't happen.<br /><br />I would also guess that there are times when the aluminum drops below the surface and I swallow it.  Probably not a major health risk ... but it can't be good!  At any rate, I won't be buying this brand of hot chocolate again.<br /><br />Edited on May 26:  Since I wrote this review, we have used a number of other brands of chocolate and coffee k-cups without encountering this problem.  Another user in commenting on this review notes that he or she has not had this problem with Cafe Escapes.  So perhaps it was just a defective batch.

review/summary: Horrible Chemical Taste
review/text: New to the world of Keurig, I bought these K-cups in a large package for my husband and I to share.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed.  Hot chocolate K-cups are designed to quick-dissolve (compared to the regular hot chocolate packages you buy from the store) and it tastes like chemicals.  The milk chocolate is no different than the dark chocolate when it comes to chemical taste.  After playing with different water level settings, I eventually just had to throw them out.  Now we buy normal hot chocolate packets instead.

Unless you have a strong stomach(like me), I would not recommend snacking on these raw(maybe mix them with sunflower seeds and raisins..may seem a bit unusual for snacking..great fiber, helps with your digestive system..endless benefits!)  If you are not comfortable munching on them, then try steeping them in a tea.  Again, wonderful and endless health benefits!!

review/text: item.  Reasonably priced for such a large quantity and with Prime no shipping costs.  I have not had a chance to use any of the garlic yet but I know the quality of Tone's products.  I am very much looking forward to using this product.  I have now used this product; it tastes good but I am not happy with the parent company "ACH companies Inc., Memphis, TN 38016  USA.  I am going to write a separate letter to the company how disappointed I am this garlic was imported from China and packed in the USA.

review/summary: Exotic Sounding
review/text: My primary reason for looking at unconventional salts was not for any kind of magical healing powers, but because I've learned how bad chemically processed salts are for you.<br /><br />I'm all for marketing even if it makes your product sound like it came right from the heavens... but I'm also for doing your own research.<br /><br />"Himalayan Salts" don't come from the mountains themselves... instead it typically comes from Pakistan a few hundred miles away.  That's not to necessarily say the mineral deposits wouldn't have come from the mountains, but it sounds a lot less exotic when you find it's the same stuff that's used to salt the roads over there.<br /><br />There are a lot of varying reports on Himalayan salt... many suggesting that it is indeed high in lots of great minerals, but any balanced report seems to suggest it's also be high in other stuff you don't want too much of, such as fluoride....  The supposed ancient lake this salt came from is from the dinosaur age, but just look what happened to them ;).<br /><br />I'm not sure what to believe now, but when I realized I was wasting way too much time I decided I'd just switch to French Gray Sea Salt also sold by the Spice Lab... If you check The Spice Lab's website, they've actually got a link to their supplier in France who seems to have been around for hundreds of years harvesting salt the old fashioned way free of any chemical/artificial processing... Many of their workers have even been in the salt harvesting industry for many generations.  Sounds good to me, much less fairy tail like.  In comparison, I watched a video online about Himalayan salts and the lady said it was important that Himalayan Salts be removed by hand to preserve it's good vibrations....<br /><br />I'm positive that this Himalayan salt is many times better than ordinary table salt, and it tastes great too!  But to best accomplish what I set out to do, I think the French Gray Salt sounds like a no-nonsense quality product that fits the bill.

review/summary: Really Does Make a Difference
review/text: Up until now, I had only ever used koshering salt in my cooking. I really felt kind of silly making what felt like an extravagant salt purchase. I added the item to my shopping cart and then removed it several times. Eventually, my curiosity got the best of me and I pulled the trigger and bought this salt.<br /><br />It truly does taste wonderful, especially as a 'finishing salt' added right before serving. On really ripe tomatoes, it is AWESOME! I have also learned that this salt is not really an extravagance when it comes to yeast bread baking. Apparently, yeast LOVES trace minerals! This salt has elevated my breads (both literally and figuratively) from pretty good to outstanding! And just like "that," I no longer felt silly buying expensive salt, because, I have spent a LOT of money on natural additives to enhance my yeast bread baking. (This one was cheap in comparison and can be used for other things!)<br /><br />I held back one star because I am very finicky about textures, and in very few applications with this salt, you can experience a very slight grittiness (from the undissolved minerals, I guess).

review/summary: Salt is not just salt anymore.
review/text: Until now I have always considered salt something that came in a shaker and was used as needed. Now I know better! First off, this salt is saltier than what you buy in a box at the grocery store. Just a pinch is enough to flavor almost anything. The taste is fantastic and it is great to know that it has many minerals in it. The price is a plus too. If you have not tried this salt for yourself yet, try it - you will thank yourself.

review/summary: Amazing Salt; You'll Use Less of It
review/text: This salt is very savory, but not overwhelmingly so. I'm a huge salt freak, and the first thing I noticed was that I needed way less of this salt when cooking. A tiny pinch is enough for an omelette or most single-serve dishes. I bought the 2lb bag back in January and still have most of it less. It may be attributed to me eating healthier overall, but I have also found that I can actually eat a meal without the use of salt, which is HUGE for me since I used to put salt even on my toast and my ideal snack is/was anchovy paste on cream cheese with Ritz crackers.

review/summary: The real thing
review/text: Himalayan natural salt is the absolute best salt in the world in my opinion. If all you've ever had is processed white table salt then you owe it to yourself to try this wonderful elixir from the earth.  Unlike processed table salt Himalayan salt is a pinkish color with natural minerals available as the Creator intended his creation to consume. The taste is extraordinary and you will find that all foods you prepare will taste better with the addition of this salt. Although more expensive than common salt the taste is well worth the added expense and the packaging by the Spice Labs is more than adequate to protect this worthwhile investment.  Not only good tasting but much healthier for you and your family.

review/text: Re: Himalayan sea salt: This salt is wonderful. Tastes great. For my family & me it does have a saltier taste than regular table salt. We just use less. My family was hesitant about using it because it is pink but once they tasted it they were on board. It is nice to know we are getting the benefits of the minerals that this salt is known to have.<br />This is the fine grain which we prefer since it does work well with a regular salt shaker. No salt mill needed.<br /> We prefer the Himalayan sea salt but at times I like the French Gray. It tends to be very moist making it unusable in a salt mill. I just use a salt box and spoon. I do love to put a pinch in my coffee. Takes away any bitterness. Yummy.<br />One more thing to add, I have NOT had fluid retention since using this salt. Low sodium. &#128523;

I ordered 2 "double 4 pounds bags" expecting to receive 16 pounds of salt.  I received two 4 pound (8# total) packages.  Their excuse was: We said it was 4 pounds. Personally, I think they have made this confusing on purpose to gain more business.  I still don't know what they mean by "double bag." If it was made confusing on purpose to get more business then, this is very unethical behavior and something I would not expect from one of Amazon's merchants.

review/text: This is a great way to get dogs to take their pills willingly. My dog is very picky, but he thinks these are treats regardless of the pills inside. If you are giving a lot of pills every day you really have to shop around to get the best prices, and order in bulk. I buy both Small and Large pill pockets - 1 in Chicken flavor and one in Beef, just for variety. The Large pill pockets may be a better buy actually because each large pocket can be used to cover 2 or more pills depending on the pill size. The pill pockets are soft so you can mold this stuff like dough around any shape or size pill or capsule - once your sure your dog really likes them & doesn't hesitate to swallow them immediately. This is much easier and less messy than using peanut butter or hot dogs, and probably healthier too.

review/summary: Color was not "Ruby Red"
review/text: The product was okay but the color was very different than advertised.  It was a darker pink, not red at all.<br /><br />I tried to use it a couple different ways, and as a relative beginner, I did not find the product easy to use.<br /><br />I tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to "paint" it on (I had read this was the best way to do it).  I found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent.  Maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively.  In the end, because the red color was important for the cake, I mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract.  the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color, not a great deal.<br /><br />In the end, I would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red.  But as was, I didn't find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again.  I hope that other people have a better experience as I very much like the idea of the product.

review/summary: Quality stuff
review/text: If you like the taste of mate, Cruz de Malta is a staple, and so is Rosamonte. Both brands deliver although Rosamonte is bit bolder in flavor, perhaps because there is more fine powder in the mix than Cruz, but that doesn't mean Cruz is any less of a mate, just different. I have Rosamonte at my desk at work for every weekday and Cruz on my counter at home for the weekends. Just my preference. Anyhow if you are in the market for good mate, you should at least try two different kinds brewed then chilled to get a basis of comparison (it's cheap at hell to buy anyway), and I believe these are the top sellers in South America, home of the mate.

review/text: This mate has an excellent flavor.  The first sip or two are a bit strong for an American palette, but from there it's smooth sailing!  Rosamonte is my favorite brand, with this a close second.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Yerba Mate tea proven to improve osteoporosis
review/text: January 2, 2012 -- Postmenopausal women who consumed yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) tea had higher bone mineral density compared with women who did not drink the tea, Andrea Conforti, MD, from the Program for the Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis in Mendoza, Argentina, and colleagues report in the January 2012 issue of Bone.<br /><br />With the price of prescription medications, this would be a good alternative if it's ok with your physician. I'm going to try it!

review/summary: Quite Good, but not the best
review/text: As I have said in another review, I'm no connoisseur of Yerba Matte, and I may haven't tried the different brands in a side-by-side sampling, but of the few brands I have tried, Cruz de Malta rates #2, with Rosemonte winning 1st place. The main difference that I noticed has less to do with flavor than it did consistency: my bag of Rosemonte had fewer sticks and stems than did mine of Rosamonte. Other than this they were--to my tongue, anyway--indistinguishable.

review/summary: Smoky & Different
review/text: First time trying this particular yerba mate. My only other experience with Yerba was from the Natural Food Co-Op in Sacramento, where it is sold by the ounce in jars. Presumably that variety was one of the steeped rather than smoked varieties, because I can't in all honesty even recall the flavor, it had so very little to remember!<br /><br />This Cruz De Malta was a very pleasant surprise with it's smoky and deep rich flavor. I made sure to not use too-hot water which brings out bitterness in yerba. I used 2tbsp of Yerba Mate, and 16oz of water in a glass tea infuser.<br /><br />I tasted it plain, and found it's quite sweet by itself (although, don't think soda-pop sweet here, more like the sweet you'd expect in a good fresh vegetable, say a good variety of spinach sauteed lightly.)<br /><br />I added 1 tbsp of honey and that was just perfect for my taste. Brewed a 2nd pot from the same leaves and still had plenty of sweetness without adding more honey.<br /><br />The flavor is very akin to good Japanese green tea, although much sweeter by itself. If you like green and herbal teas without adding sugars, you may find this tea plenty sweet by itself.<br /><br />Overall very happy with the quality and price.<br /><br />Gonna try a few other brands too, just for comparison :)

review/text: Es la primera vez que me decidi a tomar mate, no sabia nada de marcas asi que por pura corazonada compre cruz de malta. El efecto es increible, tomar mate es un habito muy bueno, que el cuerpo agradece, el estado de animo se eleva, respiras mejor, no hay fatiga en todo el dia y duermes excelente, la piel de tu rostro empieza a adquirir vitalidad.<br /><br />En cuanto a la yerba cruz de malta les puedo decir en este momento a 3 semanas de estarlo consimiendo y despues de probar otras dos marcas que fueron taragui y canarias, que Cruz de Malta es deliciosa, con un sabor muy agradable, y dura mucho, las otras que probe tenian un sabor escandaloso y me provocaron agruras.<br /><br />De verdad Cruz de Malta creo que es muy recomendable, quiero probar rosamonte que me late bien tambien pero ya sera despues.

review/text: Finally delicious Apple Butter. I've tried several brands, but it never tasted like the kind I had as a child - the kind that was so smooth and tasty. The other brands added a bunch of spices and also some were grainy.  This was smooth and had the sort of taste waking up flavor without being hidden by cinnamon or nutmeg. I now will order a bigger bottle.

review/summary: good deal for gluten free diets
review/text: This is one of the few mainstream brand soups that is both vegan and gluten free. I keep it stocked in my hurricane pantry and for regular use. It adapts well to being dressed up vegetables, gluten free pasta, extra sauces for a simple fancier dish. It is a good buy compared to the specialty brands, has more soup per can. Also has less salt, but doesn't have that low sodium taste.

review/summary: Good for vegetarians & omnivores, Not for vegans!
review/text: First of all I am giving this 5 stars because it is a pretty good tasting soup, but this soup is not for vegans. Some of you commented that this was vegan, but it is not. Here are the ingredients, taken from progresso.com: Water, Potatoes, Tomato Puree (water, tomato paste), Tomatoes, Carrots, Celery, Corn, Dark Red Kidney Beans, Green Beans, Onions. Contains less than 2% of: Modified Food Starch, Sugar, Celery Juice Concentrate, Sea Salt, Potassium Chloride, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Dextrose, Corn Protein (hydrolyzed), Salt, Citric Acid, Natural Flavor, Yeast Extract, Dried Parsley, Spice, Beet Powder (color), Calcium Chloride, Carrot Juice Concentrate, Onion Juice, Bell Pepper Juice Concentrate, Sodium Phosphate, Corn Syrup, Egg Yolk Powder, Soy Lecithin, Caramel Color, Milk. Freshness Preserved by Potassium Sorbate.<br /><br />Progresso makes no claim that this soup is vegan. Amazon should have provided the list of ingredients, but they didn't. So, if you're vegetarian or eat meat, you're fine. If you're vegan, like me (since August 3, 2012), look elsewhere! It's too bad that Progresso insists on adding eggs and dairy to their vegetable soups. My favorite was the low sodium Minestrone, but it also has egg and dairy products.

review/text: I was looking for a true Turkish Apple Tea.  Found this when I searched and hoped even though it said herbal apple tea that some of the Turkish Apple Tea taste would be there since it also said product of Turkey. Neither my husband or I could taste any apple flavor---we even tried using two tea bags per cup.  Can't say it is a bad tea as it may be standard for a herbal tea but just not what I would consider an apple tea. The two star rating was for "I don't like it" but this is one of those items where personal taste differs from person to person. IF you are looking for Apple Tea as served in Turkey this is not the one you want.
