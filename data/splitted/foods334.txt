review/summary: Best sugar alternative!
review/text: My husband and I switched to Stevia in place of sugar and other artifical sweeteners.<br /><br />The product is completely safe (you can web search for many studies) and now we saw on the news that Coca Cola is going to try it as an alternate sweetener!  It is used outside the United States normally!<br /><br />We tried many Stevias but this one tastes great and is economical!  We are Southerners and drink lots of ice tea and just a teaspoon sweetens a whole gallon of tea!  It melts easy and stores great! You use so little, the jar lasts a long time!<br /><br />Some say even this product tastes bitter.  That is because you are over doing the amount!  Back off with less and you will find the taste like sugar (and not artifical tasting like the artifical sweeteners).<br /><br />My husband was showing pre-diabetic tendencies and he only drinks Stevia for sweetener now.  He is a very "picky" eater and he loves the taste!<br /><br />We would "cry" if they stopped making this!

review/text: I love SweetLeaf stevia. It adds *a lot* of sweetness, making this two-jar set a great value.<br /><br />It does take a little mixing to dissolve in beverages, though -- keep that in mind if you're filling a cup up. I've had better success adding the stevia while the cup (or jar, when I make iced tea) is still only half-full, then mixing it in with a fork, then topping off my drink.<br /><br />This is a plant extract, not an instantly-dissolving chemical product, so don't be surprised the first time.<br /><br />It is fantastic and delicious, though!

review/text: A winner in my little test kitchen.  I've tried several other brands of stevia, and ended up coming back to Sweetleaf extract.  It has the cleanest taste and overall, is a good value.  Mixing is a little tricky, but the results are worth the extra care.  I use this mostly in hot beverages, smoothies, and sauces--using a mini measuring spoon I found on e(bay)--dash, pinch, smidge, etc.

review/summary: shame on you FDA
review/text: this is the best known naturally occuring sweetener known to man, I use it for all my drinks tea-cool-aid and even in mixed drinks works great no glycimic index or calories no carbs and no side effects. this brand has left absolutly no aftertaste for me or anyone else who had it. also find a very tiny spoon like the old mcdonalds stirrers and if you sprikle it it slowly and evenly over the drink it will dissolve on its own, dont let it clump or you will have to stir a bit harder, just my thoughts.

review/text: I use the extract powder for cooking and in my plain fage greek yogurt every morning - fabulous.  I use the stevia clear in coffee with the tabs in my purse for drinks when I'm eating away from home.  I've called the company on several occasions and gotten great info about how to use their products in baking, especially goods that have to rise.  Also, this company only uses purified water to extract the sweetness part of the plant as opposed to other companies that use chemicals...

review/summary: Sweetleaf Stevia
review/text: I started purchasing this a few years ago from Amazon and it's great, especially with subscribe & save. It is less expensive than what I can buy locally and this way I always have a good supply.  I use it in coffee, tea, lemonade etc. mainly to save the calories and I take it with me everywhere. Some people say they can taste stevia and don't like it, but I don't find this true for me, or else I just got used to it.  Another plus, my dentist told me sugar in hot beverages causes cavities so stevia may help prevent tooth decay!

review/summary: Stevia
review/text: I use stevia all the time instead of sugar. The extract is really sweet and it lasts longer than using the packets from the stores so in the long run it's cheaper. The other brands often add some kind of chemical so it's not pure stevia. When I started using stevia instead of sugar, I lost weight without even trying. I also make muffins using stevia instead of sugar. The extract doesn't work well in cold water however, so I use liquid stevia for that. It all works for me.

I cannot say enough about it....it's sweet as candy...it does not raise blood sugar ...is goes a long way, using only a tiny bit....it is sheer pleasure to a diabetic...and if not diabetic  ....still sheer pleasure...and it does not in any way alter the taste of whatever you put it in, except to sweeten just like regular sugar.  You cannot get this product at a better price than right here on Amazon.com.

review/summary: DELICIOUS!  Far exceeded my expectations!
review/text: I am a type 2 diabetic and have to limit my sugars - this is flippin' delicious.  The chocolate is creamy, fresh - and is REAL chocolate.  You know those "sugar free chocolates" in the store are "chocolate flavored" with artificial chemical sweeteners probably worse for you than sugar.  Nothing in that candy is real.  This is chocolate from cocoa beans and sweetening from stevia, a plant.  There is no after-taste as with some sweeteners (it's just sweet).  I have not tried the milk chocolate; this sample definitely does not taste like a Hershey's chocolate bar, it's not overly sweet (I love dark chocolate).  I'm not sure what chocolate the other reviewer thinks is better or more complex, but I've had Godiva and I like this as much.  This is as good as any chocolate I ever ate.  The "ginger" variety was awful, rather like jalepenos & chocolate, mint would be a better choice, all the others good.  I will definitely buy more Coco Polo but am hoping the price will become more affordable, still looking at other products.

review/summary: Like crack.  Only good for you.
review/text: I've been experimenting with homemade sugar-free chocolate for a while now, and after trying a large number of sugar substitutes, I've found it very difficult to make anything that I'm proud of.  Chocolate, in general, is very temperamental.  It has six different crystalline forms, and you have to get the temperature just right or else you wind up with a less than desirable form.  And your sugar substitute needs to be fat-soluble and anhydrous, because small amounts of water can will cause your chocolate to seize.  It's very complicated, and I've never been keen on anything I've made myself.<br /><br />Coco Polo's chocolate, by contrast, is tempered perfectly.  It has just the right snap and mouth-feel.  Because it's flavored with Stevia and Erythritol (the easiest-on-your-stomach sugar alcohol), you can eat the whole bar in one sitting and not suffer any unpleasant effects.  At least I didn't.  Everyone is different.  But I can say that even small amounts of malitol-sweetened chocolate cause me gastric upset.<br /><br />That being said, this product is not as sweet as ordinary sugared chocolate.  But that is going to be true of any sugar-free chocolate.  In particular, Coco Polo's sweetness is also somehow more subtle, which is the best I can explain it.  If your familiar with Stevia as a sweetener in tea and coffee, you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's not as intense as sugar, but it's still nice and doesn't have any chemical aftertaste.  If you are a fan of less sweet dark-style chocolates, than transitioning to this sugar free band is easy.<br /><br />If I didn't know any better I would give this product 3 or 4 stars because it is not as good as regular chocolate.  But having tried to make my own for years, I recognize when I've been outdone and I'm giving it a 5 star review.  I've also tried many brands of sugar free chocolate over the years, and I like this one the best.<br /><br />On the downside, I think this chocolate is too pricey.  When I ordered mine, it was shipped in an insulated container with cold packs to keep it stable.  This was in the spring and early fall - perhaps in the winter they forgo this treatment.  (They don't ship at all in the heat of summer.)  So perhaps the extra cost is to cover the special shipping.

review/summary: Superb Coffee
review/text: Keurig is the best and my favorite coffee is the Van Houtte French Roast.  It's a great tasting coffee with a nice full flavour without being crazy strong.  I started using the Keurig at the office in 2002, bought one for home when they came out with the home brewer a few years later.  For a single cup brewer, I am very satisfied with the convenience of use and the quality of the coffee brewed and I enjoy the Van Houtte line, especially the French Roast.

review/summary: EXCELLENT for transition from Alimentum
review/text: My daughter was on Good Start Gentle before finally moving to Similac Alimentum when her milk protein allergy was diagnosed. After 6 months of spending $500+ on formula, we were given the go ahead to try Good Start again. She struggled with the taste (Alimentum tastes AWFUL and Gerber Good Start is sweet in comparison) at first, but we tried switching her again by giving Good Start as the first bottle of the day and she had no problems. She's been on it for 6 weeks now and has no more gas or fussiness than she did on Alimentum. We love Gerber Good Start!<br /><br />When she was on Good Start Gentle previously, we used the 8.45 oz cans or the quart-size cans. Neither of those can be found anywhere. The new packing is great and weighs a lot less. I buy it as Babies R Us or Target - they always seem to have some in stock, even if it's only the 4-packs ($6.29 at Target!). The 24 pack cases seem to run about $39.99 when they are in stock. Babies R Us has had two specials in a row on them (buy 2, get $10 off instantly; then buy 2, get $15 off instantly), which they honor on multiple purchases in one visit. They also do rainchecks if it's not in stock.<br /><br />Hopefully Amazon will get some more in stock soon - we go through 4 cases a month!

review/summary: Best transitioning formula
review/text: This formula is amazing! Our son loves it. We hated the idea of giving him powder and then Gerber came out with this Tetra Pack ready to feed formula, which we find much better than other kind of packaging for this type of product (instead of cans or plastic bottles).  No constipation at all or fussiness so far. The problem is that this product is hard to find in any supermarket or pharmacy, or if you find it, there is only a small quantity of it. This is something we do not understand, since from our experience, we find that Gerber quality is much better than Enfamil or Similac.

review/text: We love this formula!! We started supplementing with the Gerber Gentle, but our daughter had a bit of an allergy and reflux so we went with the Gerber Soy until she was 5 months. While transitioning back to the Gerber Gentle, we found that the  thinness of the powder formula really aggravated her reflux. This ready to feed works so much better for our family! The new packaging means less weight to carry in her diaper bag. I would give it 5 stars if the carton was resealable since she's only drinking about 5 of the 8.45 ounces.

review/summary: Packing problems solved; product great as always
review/text: I was alarmed when I suddenly became unable to find this product in any local grocery store. I visited Amazon and was relieved to find it available here, but was troubled by the multiple reviews complaining that the packaging was poor and that the jars arrived broken. So I wrote to Amazon Customer Service to inquire about the situation. I received a prompt, courteous reply saying that the packaging problem had been corrected and that I could order with confidence. So I did. The six jars arrived the other day, IMPECCABLY packaged--each jar individually wrapped in bubble wrap, the six jars carefully packed in a box with additional cushioning, that box packed in a second box with cushioning. All six jars were in perfect condition.<br /><br />As for the product, I have relied on Nestea Unsweetened 100% Instant for years. It is the only instant iced tea I have ever been able to find that is absolutely pure, without any sweeteners, flavorings, or additives. That may not be everyone's cup of tea (so to speak), but if you like your iced tea straight, or if you prefer to add your own sweetener or lemon, this is the product to buy. (BTW, when I'm feeling like a bit of sweetness and tartness in my iced tea, I add a spoonful of all-natural frozen limeade concentrate. It's terrific.)

review/summary: Real tea, not the stuff the pushers are pushing.
review/text: This product has become UNAVAILABLE in local stores here in southeastern PA.  What has happened is that America has a love affair with sugar.  So much so, that if the food they put in their mouth is not loaded with it, they don't think it tastes good.  23g of sugar is a federal requirement in 12 oz. soft drinks, or at least it seems so.  As I've gotten older, I've given up things that obviously contain lots of sugar.  But companies are sneaky.  They know that sugar works and is addictive.  Sugar is cheaper than tea.  Add more sugar, remove some tea.  The formula is a winner.  That explains the skyrocketing diabetes in the U.S., but the companies don't care.  And it's not their fault.  Nobody forces you to take these items off the shelf and put them in your cart.  Until maybe now.  I used this concentrated tea to make my own iced tea for years.  Maybe it's just my fellow citizens that don't buy it anymore, but vendors have dropped it from the shelves.  All my visitors to my home always commented that my iced tea was very good.  I'd use the standard sugared mix, but cut off the last 1/3 of the recommended dosage, and instead added this concentrate to make it more tea, less sugar.  It works, and it works well.  But now here I am on Amazon, buying a product that I should be able to find in stores, but no dice.  And no, I don't want to spend $10.00 on energy charges to boil a boatload if teabags and deal with all of that.  This is easy.  Kudos to the seller: fast service, reasonable price.  Good health to you and your family. For the rest of you out there, don't forget to brush.

review/text: I ordered the required minimum of 6 rather large bottles (I would've been happy with one or two, but that wasn't an option).<br /><br />I was amazed when they arrived in a rather large box... because I could hear the glass bottles clunking around in there.  I opened it, and there they all were, loose and floating around inside the box.  The plastic lid on one was broken, and all the other plastic lids were loose.  The only thing keeping the dry tea powder secure was the paper seal at the top of each jar.<br /><br />So, in the end... the product is USABLE, but their care in packing was non-existent, and it's just by luck that the bottles themselves hadn't broken.

review/summary: Tastes great and easier than brewing your own tea
review/text: I used brew my own tea for iced tea, but now that my life is more hectic - I'm happier that there is an easier alternative.<br /><br />I've tried other instant teas and I find the Nestea to be my favorite.  It doesn't have a processed flavor like many other instant teas.  I prefer purchasing the unsweetened variety so I can customize the sweetness of my tea.  It also tastes great when you squeeze a bit of lemon in it.<br /><br />The tea completely dissolves quickly  - even when stirred with ice cold water.  My 10 and 11 year old can even easily make themselves a large glass.  One jar lasts quite awhile.<br /><br />Maybe it's weird, but my husband and I save the jars that this tea comes so we can drink tea out of it.  I also like to make this in a water bottle before running errands so I'm not tempted to buy expensive bottled teas or pop.

Really cuts down on that funny aftertaste, too.(But by itself it's good also, you just have to like homemade-type tea, not the chemical-store-bought kind.)

They really don't seem to have any packaging expertise at Amazon - I see both over- and under-packaging from them. This particular set of items was packaged in a box that was a good fit, with sticky bubblewrap applied somewhat haphazardly around all 6 bottles. That box was then placed inside another, larger box with AirPlus packing on three of the sides between the two boxes and one cell of AirPlus on the top. The second box packaging would be pretty ineffective as additional cushioning for a drop on the bottom of the packaging.<br /><br />This sort of poor design results in excessive waste. So that's why this is only 4 stars and not 5.

review/summary: Tea arrived in broken jar/not returnable per Amazon's policy
review/text: Hey Gang,<br /><br />My tea arrived in a box within a box with some bubble wrap and packaging.  However, I found the box in the middle of my driveway on a hot day (which is a bad omen to begin with).  Why wasn't it on the porch?  Why not at least leaning up against the garage?  Was it thrown onto the driveway by a harried UPS worker?  What I do know is that I can't use one of the jars (it arrived broken) and it's not returnable.  In today's economy, I'm trying to make smarter decisions with where I throw my money.  This tea product is a luxury for me.  I, like you, have roamed around stores without luck of finding the product.  I decided I'd go with Plan B which is to search the Internet and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  However, Plan C is to "move on" and most likely start making "Cold Brewed Iced Tea" from tea bags.  Good luck if you order this... but maybe it's time to "move on."  Lipton is thriving on the shelves but Nestea tastes better in my opinion! I give the tea 4 stars for taste but one star for packaging.

review/text: I ordered this product and when it arrived I just happened to see the UPS driver hurl the box at my front door and I heard jars breaking.  I opened the door, yelled for the driver to come back and pick up the box and handed it back to him with tea pouring out of the box.<br /><br />After contacting Amazon and explaining what happened I recommended they have the boxes marked fragile as they were glass.  After several weeks I came home to find a box on my porch marked with 2 fragile stickers.  I picked it up and heard the broken glass and tea once again pouring out of the box.  Opening the box I found 2 jars of the 6 shattered.  The box was over sized with the jars simply lying inside rolling around and it was easy to see how they break.<br /><br />I would not recommend buying this product from Amazon unless you like destroyed product.

review/summary: Blech! This stuff tastes awful unsweetened.
review/text: I'm sure there is probably someone out there who likes the taste of this stuff. I'm not one of them.<br /><br />If your goal is to find a quick-to-make unsweetened tea, you might consider bottled tea instead. This stuff tasted really bad to me.<br /><br />If you sweeten it, its probably fine. I know their sweetened varieties are good.

review/summary: Not  Like  Good  Old  Fashioned  Tea
review/text: Nestea instant sugar-free with lemon is something I tried recently at a friends place who is not a coffee drinker and is dieting.<br /><br />It's not delicious and refreshing as it looks. The addition of Aspartame gives it that distinct aspartame taste. The after taste is also unsavory.Putting in fresh lemon juice was the only way I could drink it.<br /><br />I don't consume very much sugar, still I thought I'd try it. I would prefer to have no sugar at all than have aspartame in it.<br /><br />Occasionally I drink regular tea with lemon, but no sugar.<br />This is just my personal opinion, but when I'd read up on Aspartame being a possible carcinogenic, I never used it again until recently.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because it's healthier to diabetics who want a somewhat sweet taste, but for myself, I don't like chemicals, only natural drinks and flavors.

review/summary: My favorite "Mocktail"
review/text: I first purchased this in a package <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DM1Z3Q">Crystal Light Mocktails Drink Mixes, 3-Flavors, 15-Count</a> along with the Appletini and Margarita flavors. The Appletini and Margarita were good, but not as good as this Mojito Drink Mix.  This has the taste of lime and is sweet but also a little tart, much like a real Mojito.  It also has a slight minty taste which I really like. It doesn't have aftertaste.<br /><br />Each canister contains 5 packets that will make 2 quarts each.  I usually use them in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006P4BR3E">Contigo AUTOSPOUT� Addison 24 oz. Water Bottles 3 pack Blue, Charcoal, Honeysuckle</a> and just mix it to taste. It has 5 calories per serving which is 1/8 of a packet so it's good when you're trying to watch the calories.  The ingredients are: Citric Acid, Maltodextrin, Aspartame (Sweetener), Acesulfame Potassium (Sweetener), Sugar, Magnesium Oxide, Contains Less Than 2% of:, Natural Flavor, Yellow 5, Blue 1<br /><br />I like it best over ice.  I fill my water bottle about 3/4 of the way full add the Mojito Drink Mix and then fill the bottle the rest of the way with ice. It dissolves very easily. It also makes a good cocktail in a pinch if you add rum or vodka. Two thumbs up for this great product from Kraft Foods.

review/summary: Tasty but not authentic
review/text: Authentic mojito taste this product does not make. It is very tasty nonetheless.  As someone who grows his own mint leaves and fancies himself a mojito connoisseur, I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon this product.  Its very existence demonstrates how the parent of Crystal Light, Kraft, invests in product innovation.  In fact, it is somewhat interesting how boring companies like Kraft and P&G can invent new products to entice consumers to spend their money - even on products that have no caloric or nutritional value.  That being said, I encourage Kraft to craft more mojito-flavored products.  In fact, I would even volunteer to be a beta tester.

review/summary: Excellent brightness - Very Efficient
review/text: These lights have exceptionally good light output.  I bought the 30 Watt version and they were too bright when I used them in a light fixture with 5 lamp sockets.  These are still rather bright in the same 5 socket light fixture, but acceptable.  The light output will become a little less with time. When compared to an incandescent bulb, these appear to be pure white and the standard bulb a weak yellow glow by comparison.  Once you adapt to these full spectrum bulbs, you cannot go back to standard incandescent bulbs. Now I am replacing incandescent bulbs in all areas of my new house except in areas of low usage or places the bulbs will not fit. These bulbs will fit in most fixtures, however. I am replacing the fixture in my garage to put some 45 Watt full spectrum bulbs into a cluster light fixture. I live in the Houston, Texas area so cold weather is not normally a problem.  Fluorescent bulbs often are weak in light output in cold weather until they warm up after a few minutes.  When warm, they work fine. I have not tried this particular bulb series in a cold soak environment yet.  The payoff should come this summer when electric bills are at their peak.  These bulbs are very efficient and produce a lot less heat than incandescent bulbs.  I look forward to the day that LED bulbs become affordable and brighter, but for now, this is the way to go. Definitely avoid the so called warm white fluorescent bulbs in the stores.  Order only full spectrum CFL bulbs or those rated 51K or 55K or anything in the 5000 to 6000 Kelvin light spectrum. I would avoid the bulbs in the 6000 Kelvin range.  They probably have too much of a blue shift.  The 51K or 5100 Kelvin bulbs are perfect. Then it is just a matter of selecting the wattage you want.  For multiple bulb fixtures, these 23 Watt bulbs are perfect.  For single bulb fixtures, you probably want a higher power bulb than these. I am using a 45 Watt 51K fluorescent bulb over my breakfast nook and it is just right. These full spectrum bulbs are great for SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) people like me.  I get winter depression when it is cloudy and bleak for a long time. Normally Houston has plenty of sunshine, but this winter has been unusually cold. Well, at least I am not in the frozen north. This is quite a switch for me because I just moved from the San Francisco area.

review/summary: Excellent bulb, but misleading description - NOT "super mini"
review/text: First, I would give this bulb 5 stars if the description was correct, and will happily change my rating if that is fixed! The problem is that these are not "super mini" bulbs. Earthmate does make a 2700K super mini bulb that is 4.6" long, but the only 23W full-spectrum bulb they list, at 5" long, is this one. (The actual model number for this bulb is E2357AE on their website, which matches the individual units of the 6-pack.)<br /><br />These bulbs are fairly pricey compared to the average 23 watt full-spectrum bulb, and I paid the extra money partially based on the assumption that these would be smaller.<br /><br />Now, on to actually reviewing the product! The bulbs are average sized, and should fit in most lamps and fixtures; however, I did have one fixture where they were just a bit too long to fit. The brightness and coloration are excellent; they seem to put out a bit more light than other 23W full-spectrum bulbs I have. The CRI is 88; not the highest around but very good. The light is extremely close to my ALZO bulbs, which are still my favorite full-spectrum bulbs (other than the fact that they're huge and don't fit in most things!) The bulbs turn on to a fairly decent brightness and fully warm up very quickly. I've noticed zero buzzing or flickering.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say these are the best 23W full-spectrum bulbs I've tried that are "normal" sized, which is the only thing that kept me from just returning the 5-pack despite the size issue. (Yes, 5-pack, since one of my bulbs was DOA. Amazon was nice enough to offer a partial refund for that bulb, which I decided was better than shipping all six bulbs back and forth.) They're also a bit expensive as noted; the price would be more in line if they were actually smaller as claimed.<br /><br />(I did contact Amazon with links to the manufacturer's information in hopes that they fix the description and/or stock actual "super mini" bulbs, assuming Earthmate actually makes them in a full-spectrum version! I would love to have this product in a smaller version, if it exists...)<br /><br />Sep 7 edit: Down to 4 working bulbs after having these bulbs in for 4 days. :( The one that just died was in a fixture paired with another of the same... I'm going to give them another couple weeks and see if any more die before I decide whether to return them or have them all replaced. It's possible it was shipping damage since the outer box arrived crushed (though the product box was fine), so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Oct 4 edit: I had the bulbs replaced a couple weeks ago. Whoever packed them wasn't too bright, since he or she just stuck a FedEx label on the product box without any extra packaging! Not cool for shipping light bulbs, Amazon. Only 4 bulbs arrived working, certainly due to shipping damage this time. Fortunately Amazon told me to do whatever with the first shipment rather than return it, so I have 8 working bulbs now, which I can't complain about since no more have died since then. (Of course, they're still not "super mini" as listed, so my review remains at 2 stars instead of 5.)

review/summary: THESE ARE NOT SUPER MINI BULBS!!!!!
review/text: I'm not sure why these are labeled as super mini bulbs.  These bulbs are larger than standard incandescent bulbs and will not fit in many of my fixtures.  I suspect amazon has mixed up the bulbs they are selling.  I checked the manufactures website and this model bulb is not the item number that matches the super mini bulbs.  EP2357AE bulbs are listed as 23-Watt Full Spectrum Bulbs.  E2352AK is the product number for 23 Watt Super Mini Bulbs and they are not full spectrum bulbs.  As of the date this review was typed the manufactures website is not showing a Super Mini 23 Watt Full Spectrum Bulb.  I'm returning these.  I also purchased the 15 Watt Super Minis and they are not the correct item either.<br />If you decide to purchase these bulbs you may want to check the manufactures website after you receive the bulbs to make sure you did in fact receive the right item.

review/summary: great bulbs at great prices
review/text: regular CFL bulbs tend to be more yellow than natural lights. full spectrum bulbs tend to be more pale blue. My eyes are very sensitive to lights and yellow lights tend to make me feel a little 'winter gloom'. So I mixed full spectrum bulbs with regular ones to achieve a warm (yellow) but still up-lifting (white) lighting effects.<br /><br />I was not able to find full spectrum CFL at my local stores, so I was very happy when I found them at amazon and at such a great price.<br /><br />Earthmate uses recycled papers for packagings instead of those hard to cut plastic shells, which is great.<br />The only reason I gave it 4 star was because they are so green-conscious that they use very little glue on the box. when I tried to open the box from the acutal box openings, the side where it was glued together would break open and the box cannot hold a bulb any more.

review/text: These bulbs make my room (painted blue) look absolutely vivid and beautiful, specially compared to my previous 27K CFL lightbulbs.<br /><br />I have ALZO 55K lightbulbs, love it so decided to change all my 27K CFL lightbulbs to 55K in my first floor. ALZO bulbs are way too big to fit most of my light fixtures. These ones are perfect size.<br /><br />I like to comment is the Amazon's service. Amazon sent me the package, the first shipment was wrong items, 27K bulbs. I returned and asked for replacement. Amazon shipped me the right one but with two broken light bulbs. I was not happy but not mad since this is the only issue I ever had with Amazon in my last few years. I bought all from Amazon unless it does not carry.<br /><br />Amazon shipped me the replacement with no charge. The person even opened the package to make sure no broken light bulbs, then wrapped an extra protection layer before putting into a already very good packaging box.<br /><br />I will buy more when I replace my another light fixture next month.<br /><br />Updated.<br />I have changed the rating to 3 from 5. One of the six bulbs just burned out after only 2 months usage.

review/summary: The best light bulbs!
review/text: Since my husband and I are summer person who live in 4 season place, I bought these light bulbs to make our cold winter little more cheerful. These bulbs come with eco-packaging which I like, and it was bonus that I didn't have to deal with bulky packaging. First I turned on the light, I noticed it is little dim, but after couple minutes, it reaches full strength. For my small bedroom (10'X 7'), one light bulb was enough to make the room bright.<br />When I read while I was lying down, I noticed that the light actually doesn't hurt my eyes even if I look directly. I do have very sensitive eyes, so I was very happy that this bulbs don't make my eyes tired.<br />Also, I bought more lamps and had short of these bulbs, so I went ahead and used my plain old light bulb. My husband and I could not believe that how dim, irritating the yellow light bulb was compared to our full spectrum bright soft white light bulbs. I don't think I can go back to normal light bulb ever again, and now I told all my families to change theirs as well. They are all happy just like me. Energy saving is extra bonus on top of every benefit to have this light bulb.

review/summary: Started out OK, now terrible two years later
review/text: My Amazon instant update says I bought these 2.5 years ago, so it's time for a recap review. I initially thought these had decent brightness, understandably somewhat dimmed compared to other similar 23-watt bulbs because of the full spectrum coatings. Now, however, they have reduced in brightness well beyond their initial levels and 1 of the 6 bulbs failed completely. For the price, this is a significant investment of money and I expected them to last much longer, especially since they are only used 20 or so hours per week. Essentially I'm at an estimated 2k or 3k (max) hours of use and I think it's time to replace them because we have 4 bulbs (2 each in 2 overhead fixtures) in one 13' x 16' room and it's hard to see at night because these bulbs have lost so much luminance. So the 8,000 hour lifespan is fairly misleading if my 6 bulbs are typical of the quality you can expect.

review/summary: Let's get real.
review/text: There are lots of suckers out there buying these bulbs. In order to sell these bulbs, the tree hugging manufacturers make many claims that are blatant lies. Nobody seems to care because these fakers are "saving the planet".<br />Let's clear up some obvious issues.<br />1. These don't begin to produce the light output of a traditional 100 watt incandescent bulb. Pure nonsense. They have the light output of a 60 watt bulb. MAYBE!!! Enjoy the romantic mood.<br />2. They don't last 7 years. I replaced all the bulbs in my house two years ago. Half of them are kaput. Another lie.<br />3. The light temperature isn't neutral. Install these in your kitchen and your food will look inedible. Especially anything with red sauce.<br />You could switch back to the good old incandescent ones, but by years end, they will be taken off the market. The 100 watt ones were banned at the end of 2011. The 75s are next.<br />Thanks Washington for running our lives. Where would we be without you? Answer: Better off.

review/summary: Too harsh for normal use
review/text: The three star rating is for the "full spectrum" bulbs only.  We've purchased about 30 Earthmate bulbs of various sizes now.  We're mostly happy, but the 6 "Full spectrum" bulbs we bought give out a harsh white light that is hard to live with.  We've managed to find places where we won't use them often.  The other "soft white" bulbs we bought work just fine.  The 30-watt bulbs are especially  bright and nice, but can actually put out too much light in a multibulb fixture and so might need to be mixed with 13 or 23 watt bulbs in that setting.  One other issue is that several of the Earthmate bulbs we received were broken and two were DOA but not broken.  The broken ones were clearly a case of poor packaging by Amazon (bulbs against the side of the box with no packing filler).  Amazon is great about refunding the appropriate amount so I have no worries about ordering Earthmate bulbs again.

Believe it or not, it's like having a small farm in the house that produces an impressive amount and array of "fresh vegatables", albeit in sprout form. The sprouts grown in these trays stay fresh and never develop an unpleasant smell. They taste crisp, are pleasant to eat and have become the mainstay in my daily intake of vegetables in my diet. I clean my trays outside with a spray nozzle attached to my garden hose. This makes cleaning quick and easy, then I rinse them in the sink with some bleach in the water to sterilize them before growing a fresh crop. The trays are foolproof and have changed the way I eat. With the price of vegetables rising in the supermarkets, I've found these trays to be a great money saver - to say nothing of the superior nutrition that eating sprouts provide. I would highly recommend them to anyone!<br /> - Chris Morton

review/summary: Here is great idea for simplifying your wheatgrass growing in the Master Sprout Sprouter!
review/text: Here's is something that will simplify your wheatgrass growing IMMENSELY!  Begin by soaking about a half-cup of wheat berries (hard winter wheat is usually recommended) twelve hours (more or less) and allowing them to sprout for three days or so.  When you are ready to spread these little sprouts out into your sprouter, first fit one sheet of natural, untreated paper towel in the bottom of the sprouter (you can find these untreated paper towels at almost any healthfood store).  You do not need to trim all the extra around the edges because after dry fitting, you will moisten the paper which will cause it to cling to the sides making a nice neat little container.  You can moisten the fitted paper towel with kitchen sink spray or soft-pressure kitcen faucet water.  Sometimes we moisten it from a kelp-water spray bottle.  Either before or after fitting and moistening the paper towel to the inner contour of the sprouter, try cutting off about an inch and a half triangle from one corner of the fitted paper towel.  This will give you an open corner from which to make later draining of the growing sprouts MUCH faster and easier.  It is also helpful to mark one corner of the sprouter itself so that later on as you are rinsing the growing wheatgrass, you will know where the open draining corner is located.  This will be helpful to know if you want to lean the sprouter at an angle to allow the extra rinse water to run off for a minute.<br /><br />Next you spread the sprouting wheat evenly along the bottom of the moistened paper toweling.  I usually like to come back and spray them with the kitchen sink spray to help distribute them evenly over the bottom of the container, but this can easily be done with your fingers.  If you wish, at this stage you can spray the spread with kelp water.  Then place the container in some window light ... direct sunshine is NOT necessary or recommended, and rinse twice a day ... or more the first few days if you have time. Two will do.<br /><br />After you have chewed or juiced or otherwise ingested your wheatgrass crop and are ready to clean out the stubble and roots, all you have to do is start at any corner and pull out the entire mat in one piece.  The paper towel helps hold the roots (not all but enough to make an easily remmoval one-piece mat)together inside the sprouter.  Once you have disposed of this large mat of roots and stubble, the sprouting container is very simple to clean.  The entire process (removing the remains and cleaning the now empty container does not take me longer than three or four minutes...maybe less.  It certainly has taken me far longer to write this review.  I once tried two layers of paper toweling and the results were nothing like as positive as just the one layer.  Nothing else that I have tried this layering with (except garlic for which I prefer to use a cut piece of Sure-To-Grow (the most economical way to go here is with the 20-foot grow rolls) or nothing at all.  The paper towel layering did not work well at all for buckwheat greens or sunflower greens.  I grow both of these in just a plain empty Master Sprout spouter (large and/or small).  BUT FOR WHEATGRASS, I have never had such great crops with such an easy and fast clean up as with this single-layer, natural paper towel process. Also, I do tend to spray all of my growing sprouts with liquid kelp-water solution, (but you can get plenty of beautifully green crops without it).  The really good news, as far as I am concerned, is no more soil for either wheatgrass or sunflower greens, etc.! Now that I have retired and am living in an apartment, soil is out...paper towels and Master Sprout spouters (with or without paper towels) are in. I hope no one will allow the complications of soil prep, etc. to keep them for great wheatgrass growing.  Also, with these Master Sprout sprouters, other greens for which soil has long been recommended can be grown soil free, e. g., sunflower greens and buckwheat greens.<br /><br />Oh, and one last idea.  The Easy Sprout sprouter is the perfect way to start absolutely everything and for beans (which don't need to be greened). I've been sprouting for over thirty years, and I have never before found it this easy and I credit that to the combination of these two sprouting system.  I don't see how it could be made any easier.  The two together cover all of our sprouting needs: Easy Sprouter takes care of starting all sprouts for later transfer into the Master Sprout containers AND it covers the complete sprouting of beans which do not need greening.  Master Sprouters take care of all the things that need greening.  I am sprouting and cooking for two and make full use of three Easy Spouters, 5 Master Sprouters (the regular larger size), and 3 Master Sprouters (mini).  I keep three wheatgrass sprouters cycling for a constant supply; buckwheat greens and sunflower greens (for salads); garlic and a variety of beans (mostly for soups and stews).  All that is needed for this is one 48-inch wide diningroom window with a 20-inch by 48-inch wide folding table to hold the sprouters in the light.  The Easy Sprouters stay in the kitchen.  As you can see, the entire operation  does not take up much space and yet it gives a much appreciated large quantity of live food year round.  Rinsing takes no more than ten minutes twice a day.

review/summary: Well Made and Good for Sprouting
review/text: When I opened the box, I thought I had spent a lot of money for some plastic bins.  However, they fit together well, I had no spilling of water, and they are totally dishwasher safe.  The little instruction booklet, though not very flashy, was very helpful in getting me started in sprouting.  Definitely a good investment.

review/summary: Tried & True Best Sprouter
review/text: I began sprouting in the 70's with a glass jar and cheesecloth.<br />Having used a few sprout gadgets over the years, I can say without hesitation that this Sproutmaster sprouter is simply the best.<br />It has worked well with seeds, nuts and legumes.<br />It cleans up easily.<br />Because sprouts are kept in the dark during sprouting, I leave the lid off on the last day for the chlorophyll action to green them up even more.<br />I have been using the Sproutmaster now for 10 years.<br />Three trays are ample for a family of five. You'll learn seed selection & timing rotation as you go.<br />It is worth every cent I paid for it.<br /><br />To Your Health!<br /><br />{{* *}}

review/summary: I'm a newbie at this!
review/text: I am new to sprouting.  The Sproutmaster gets great reviews from other exclusive sprouting sites.  I like the design and the stack-ability.  I have sprouted twice in it so far, and both times my sprouts got white mold on them and had to be tossed.  I am doing something wrong and will need to do some more research.  I would like for the directions to address this problem, but they do not.  I bought this to replace my jar method, which did not mold, but I have yet to learn the "technique."  If you know what you are doing, I'm sure it is great.  I know the first time I sprouted, it molded because I had the bottom upside down and there was no ventilation.  The second time, I'm not sure what I did wrong.  It is definitely my mistake and not the product.  Hope this helps!

review/summary: Nothing beats this sprouter
review/text: I have used just about every type of sprouter over the years, but the sprout master is the one for me.  It makes perfect sprouts every time.  Drainage and air circulation is excellent.  The level of difficulty is: EASY.  They work well when stacked.  I like my sprouts growing vertically I have learned.  I prefer greening them up before eating, so this makes the perfect design.  Plus the sprouts look absolutely gorgeous in the sproutmaster, unlike Easy Sprout, or jar sprouting where they are all bunched together.  Make sure you sterilize the tray with vinegar and water soaks before sprouting new sprouts. If you do that, you should have no problems with mold.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: Everyone in our family of five loves sprouts, but in our small kitchen, I've never been able to grow enough to keep everyone satisfied. This piece of equipment changed that. We can now have sprouts every day, and everyone has seconds when they want them. The compact shape and the three generous trays fit tons of veggies while taking up only a small portion of our counter space. I can even set a jar of seeds on top of the sprouter for soaking--no extra space necessary. Drainage is great, and I love being able to divide my crops into six separate types, or time them so that we have a fresh crop almost daily. The only thing I'd change if I could is... I wish it were prettier. It's not ugly by any means, but it is sort of bland... it would be cool to be able to see the sprouts as they grow, through clear sides or something. Nevertheless, I'm extremely happy with it--thanks to Sprout Master, my kids are eating their veggies and thanking me for them!

review/summary: Just OK for me...
review/text: The Sprout Master is made nicely and looks like it will last a long time. However, it has pin-size holes for drainage, and doesn't seem to work well with small seeds.  I am mostly making broccoli sprouts and alfalfa sprouts (small seeds).  Probably the Sprout Master would work fine with sunflower seeds, nuts, beans, wheat, or other seeds that are at least as large as a mung bean.  What happens with the small seeds, such as the broccoli sprouts, is that they grow their roots through the holes, and their roots make a thick mat underneath.  So then it is very hard to remove the entire sprout.  The roots break off, so then we have only the tops of the sprouts.  I'm able to scrape the roots off of the backside and put them in the salads too, but it's just not as nice as the whole sprout unbroken.  I don't have this problem with my other sprouting system, the Tompson & Morgan Seed Sprouter - Two-tiered (also available at Amazon).  It works so much better because it has slots instead of pinholes.<br /><br />The broccoli sprouts don't make a mat of roots underneath the tray with the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter.  They just make sprouts like you would see in the grocery store.  I've also noticed that my sprouts grow much faster in the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter.  I've done many comparisons, and it always is like this.  I am not sure why.  So, all things said, I wish that I hadn't bought the Sprout Master Triple Sprouter.  I would have bought several more Tompson and Morgan Sprouters instead.  They look very attractive and are a lot easier for me to deal with than the Sprout Master.  I'm sure the Sprout Master is great for people that are using the larger seeds.  Maybe I will start doing some larger seeds/nuts/beans too, but my main interest is with broccoli sprouts, alfalfa sprouts, radishes sprouts, etc., all of which have tiny seeds.<br /><br />The other thing about the Sprout Master, as others have noted, is that it's a bit difficult to clean small seeds out of the holes.  You have to use the tip of a paperclip to poke stuff out sometimes.<br /><br />Once again the Tompson & Morgan is so much easier -- with their slots instead of pin-size holes, the seeds and other stuff fall right out during a quick wash and rinse.  No paperclips and poking needed!<br /><br />And the Tompson & Morgan has gone through my dishwasher many times without harm.  Sprout Master says don't put theirs in dishwasher, so I have not.<br /><br />By the way, if anyone has some ideas for how I can make the Sprout Master work better with my little seeds, I would love to read your comments.  Thanks!

review/text: When I was a child I fell in love with this candy-the flavors were so fun!<br />Fast forward to now: just a few years ago, I found Neccos at a dollar store and began buying them again-but, for some reason, the Necco company decided to "mess with perfection" and re-formulated the flavors to reflect the ones they used many years ago (before my time)<br />And, sadly, they were horrible! I tried a roll and could not identify even one of the flavors-I threw them away and never bought them again.<br />Then one day I was checking something else out on Amazon,and they popped up-not the new and improved ones-but the ones I enjoyed from childhood!!<br />I then ordered 2 boxes of them from Amazon and have been in "Necco heaven" ever since!!
