review/summary: Nice mild minty tea, actually makes an enjoyable cup.
review/text: I've been tasting along several green tea's trying to find one that I liked.<br />I was beginning to feel a little like goldilocks. One would be too strong, the other too bland.<br />I think the spearmint in this tea adds an really nice note with the peppermint and lemongrass, making it actually enjoyable rather than a necessary evil.<br />I found the mint to be nicely pronounced, and the lemongrass to be only barely detectable, with a little bit of honey it's really good.<br />So if you're looking for a way to incorporate green tea into your daily routine, and like me you like it mildly paired with mint. Then give this tea a shot.<br />(I do agree that maybe you should try with a single box first, so that you're not stuck with 6 if your palate is more refined than mine)

review/summary: Very mild green tea
review/text: I am not a very big fan of green tea. I have always found the flavor to be a bit strong. I have had real Moroccan mint tea and found that to be a bit strong as well (in the mint direction). This tea was the perfect mild blend of both for me. And because it is all natural (no artificial or "natural" flavorings) I have been able to drink it every other day on my detox.<br /><br />Please Note: I did not purchase through Amazon. I purchased a box at Target. I would recommend trying it before investing in 6 boxes. I do plan to order this offer thru Amazon once my current box is depleted.

review/text: I love the health benefits of green tea, but the taste? not so much. Of all the green teas I've tried I like this one the best (followed by those that include  Jasmine). I had trouble finding this in my local grocery stores, eventually finding it at Von's and Ralph's in So. Cal. Then I found I could get it from Amazon, and with a nice savings as well. Tasty with a nice fragrance also.

review/text: I'm trying to drink more green tea because it is so good for you. I'm trying all the Stash green teas one after the other. This one is a favorite as it had a strong Pomegranate and Raspberry flavor I love. By mixing these flavors in with green tea it makes green tea less bitter. The ingredients in this tea include: green tea, chamomile, hibiscus, orange peel, pomegranate flavor, raspberry flavor and Japanese matcha. A perfect tea with honey on a rainy afternoon.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: the flavor was not what I expected
review/text: Had this been labeled "green tea with a touch of pomegranate and raspberry essence" I might have rated this higher.  However, the name is pomegranate raspberry and I therefore expected those vary flavors.  The overall taste is mild and muddled.  I except a greater sweetness.  The tea's second ingredient, chamomile, has a distinctive presence.  While I didn't find the flavor to be unpleasant, there is nothing about it that would make me reach for it over one of my other teas.

review/text: This green tea by Stash, just might be one of the best ways to get your jasmine tea fix, and your antioxidants, to boot. The scent of jasmine blossoms comes through very nicely. You can actually enjoy this tea without any sugar, though I still prefer a little bit. There were no discernible aftertastes and I'd say the caffeine kick was light. I'd certainly buy this tea again and again...pass the crab rangoons, please!

review/summary: Exquisite Tea
review/text: I do not find this tea to be overly sweet and I take it hot or cold without any sweetener. I prefer it hot I find, but have tried it iced and found it to be quite pleasant.  This tea has a lightly fruity taste.  There are many ingredients, which I have found to be true of all of Stash's herbal teas.  To fear the ingredients, they are all top quality and marry well.  I wondered what "goji berry flavor" was and contacted the company.  Here is a transcript:<br /><br />Email reply from Stash when asked about goji berry flavor:<br /><br />Unfortunately it's proprietary information with our suppliers; however we do require natural statements from our suppliers. We use the Code of Federal Regulations as far as our definition of natural<br /><br />According to the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), the term natural flavor means "the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive,  protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juices, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible years, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in t food is flavoring rather than nutritional."<br /><br />There you have it, essential oil of goji berry.  Not so mysterious after all.  I recommend getting the superfruit sampler where you get to try this flavor and five others.  I have found them all to be outstanding and go back for more all the time.

review/summary: Clean and subtle rather than grassy, a stand-out flavor in a crowded field
review/text: I drink STASH PREMIUM MOROCCAN MINT GREEN TEA all day with no adverse "overdose" effects from caffeine.  The flavor is not grassy like some green teas, but very clean.  I don't normally like mint taste in anything other than gum or toothpaste, but this mint is subtle and goes great with the clean taste of the tea.  Besides green tea, the ingredients are spearmint, lemongrass, and peppermint.  Lemongrass is another ingredient that can be overwhelming, but if it's truly in there, I can't taste it.  So as I write this, I am realizing it contains a lot of flavors that shouldn't work for me, but they do!  In fact, I enjoy it so much, I get a little anxious if I let myself run low.  It's a great thing to be able to order it in bulk from Amazon.<br /><br />I do want to note that the tea can get a little bitter if steeped too long.  I try to go no longer than five minutes, but I often forget about it at work.  For me, it's drinkable but noticeable.  On the other hand, I'm not an aficionado.  I don't worry about the temperature of the water I use to brew the tea.  At home, I use the hot water that comes out of my Keurig coffee maker; at work, I use the hot water out of the filtered water dispenser.  As evidenced by the amount I consume, the flavor comes out great!

review/summary: Hot water
review/text: I tried to like this tea being that I bought a whole box, but I am still working on it going 4 months now. I drink at least one cup of tea at work everyday and I am partial to mint in my tea. However, there is little to no tea or mint flavor going on here. I have shared this with many people at work and it isn't just me.<br /><br />There are particles left behind in the tea bag with more aroma than the brewed tea itself. I always leave the bag in the cup as I drink it and it never gets stronger. There is nothing satisfying about it, I might as well just drink hot water.<br /><br />I do like stash teas but don't make my mistake, try it first. The packages I received are different than pictured now, maybe it has improved. I am disappointed.

review/text: I picked up some of this tea at the grocery store last week. It has some grassy aftertaste that many green teas have but not as much as some brands. I was careful with water temp and how long I let it steep and it wasn't bitter. It tastes somewhat clean and fresh but I like the much less expensive Salada better and I don't have to be careful with it like I do with Stash teas.

review/summary: Stash Premium Fusion Red, White & Blueberry Tea
review/text: Amazing tea.<br /><br />That pretty much sums it up - it's an amazing tea. The taste is sweet and the smell is strong and also sweet. I love waking up, steeping a teabag with two teaspoons of cane sugar and half water half milk mixture. Adding milk gives the tea an amazing body and unlike a reviewer said below, there is no notes of green olives nor of cough syrup - this tea is simply astounding.<br /><br />I've tried Stash's Mango/Passion fusion and their Chai tea but didn't care for those, then I stumbled upon this one and O-M-G is all I had to say. The Chai has a somewhat bitter aftertaste and the Mango/Passion is forgettable on the palette. This tea however I love. The smell like I said is strong, super strong, and sweet. The taste is also amazing, very fruity and very very endearing. However, on the downside, I would not recommend that you make this tea with water alone, although it is a very smooth tea, it lacks body - thus, like I said before, make it as follows:<br /><br />Steep in 4oz hot water with 2 teaspoons of cane sugar (or substitute your own)<br />Add 4oz warm milk<br /><br />The milk as I said gives it extra body that the tea lacks, however it is forgiveable. Stash truly hit the mark on this one and hopefully they don't discontinue it - because the day they do discontinue it, I will be a very very sad man :(

The caffeine content is not as high as the one of coffee, or even regular green tea, which makes this a good beverage choice at all times of the day.

Even though I just bought 6 boxes, I would buy this again for sure (me and my family have already gone through three, and I gave one away as a gift).

The listing says only 5 left, nearly out of stock, does this mean it's being discontinued? I am frustrated with Stash coming out with new flavors left and right and stores can only stock so many. Every time I find one I like, the stores stop carrying. I hope this continues to be available from Amazon.

review/text: I like this better than the Bigelow that I was drinking before and the price is really good.  This is actually the first tea of any kind that I've been able to drink without adding artificial sweetener or honey.  It has a nice subtle flavor and, on a wholly superficial note, the beautiful green individual packages look lovely in a glass container on the counter.

review/summary: Insanely powerful
review/text: I bought this oil after reading all of the reviews that mentioned just how strong it is.  However, it can't be understated just how powerful it is.  I have been using it for making cinnamon hard candy.<br /><br />I put a half teaspoon of the cinnamon oil in a blue, Kitchenaid measuring spoon and set it aside for a few moments.  When I picked up the spoon again, I noticed that the oil was blue colored.  Upon further inspection, I discovered that the oil had actually eaten away at the plastic--it was like I had put nail polish remover (acetone) in the spoon.  Do not use this product with plastic measuring spoons!<br /><br />If you're planning to make hard candy with this as well, I'd also recommend that you let the sugar mixture cool quite a bit before adding the cinnamon oil.  Adding it at the 300 degrees F needed for the hard crack stage just leads to an overpowering cloud of cinnamon in your kitchen and flavorless candy.<br /><br />This product is good stuff; just be very careful when using it.

review/summary: Awsome Cinnamon Oil
review/text: I ordered this because as a teenager I used to make cinnamon toothpicks. I have tried others and they were not the same, so I purchased this in hopes it would be different, and oh yes, my prayer answered. I used this oil with toothpicks to help me stop smoking, this is one great product. I have to slightly lick the toothpick befor placing the whole thing in my mouth or my mouth would be "on fire". After that it is just perfect, the oil takes the nicotine bleeding through my gums and it covers the taste so I can go about my business and not think about smoking. You are asking, has it worked? And my answer is "YES", it's working and going on 8 weeks now. Thanks to this oil it has helped ease the pain and cover up tasted I was hoping it would. As another poster stated, it is very potent so you may want to dilute this. Thanks for a 100% quality product.

review/summary: fantastic for ice tea
review/text: I bought this cinnamon oil specifically to improve the flavor of<br />ice tea.  I am too busy to steep tea, so I just have a gallon<br />jug that I put up 16 bags of tea (1 bag per 8 ounces of water:  You<br />can use bulk tea to save time and money:  I use 1/2 regular and<br />1/2 decar so I don't get too much caffein, and I try to drink 32<br />ounces of it a day) and empty the tea out of the bags<br />and into the jug, fill it with water, shake it and put in the refer (<br />tests prove that there are just as many antioxidants in refrigerator<br />tea as in steeped tea!)<br /><br />After at least 24 hours, I strain it into another jug, add stevia,<br />and 1 or two drops of cinnamon oil per cup of water, shake and<br />use as needed.  It VASTLY improves the taste of the tea, also<br />helped me overcome a diet coke habit and with all the studies about<br />the benefits of tea and cinnamon, I feel good about drinking it.<br />Try it.  You won't be sorry (and since there are 2400 drops in<br />the 4 ounce bottle of cinnamon oil, it ends up costing you only<br />1 or 2 pennies per cup to drink the tea!  What a wise and cost<br />efficient way to improve your health!

review/summary: Great cinnamon oil
review/text: This stuff is great.  It might be more expensive than the "cinnamon flavor" or "cinnamon extract" you get in the grocery store, but it is so much more concentrated that it works out to be cheaper in the long run.  I made cinnamon hard candy.  To 2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup corn syrup I used 1 teaspoon (see update below) cinnamon oil.  That made a strong cinnamon flavor without being really hot.  Yum.<br /><br />Update:  The first time I made this I added the cinnamon oil when the candy was still 290F.  I got a cloud of cinnamon steam in my face and perfectly flavored candy.  I just tried it again but I let the candy cool slightly before adding the cinnamon.  I got less steam (but still a lot) and candy that was WAY too spicy.  I assume that the first time a bunch of the cinnamon oil evaporated, so the amount you need depends on the temperature of the candy when you add it.  Next time I am going to add 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon to the slightly cooled candy.

review/summary: Great Product - Brings Back Memories
review/text: I've been retired for a little over 4 years now. When I was in grade school, we used to go down to the local pharmacy and buy "Pure cinnamon Oil" and would soak toothpicks in it overnight. These "Hot Toothpicks" got hotter as you sucked on them. I saw a write-up recently where some folks were using them to control smoking and for weight loss. Well, I quit smoking 17 years ago, but I sure could use some help with weight loss. I went to my local Rite-Aid pharmacy, but they said they no longer carry cinnamon oil but that I could buy it in the "Spices" section of any supermarket. They were wrong! you can get Cinnamon EXTRACT, but that's just for cinnamon flavoring when you are making baked goods or candy. I wanted the Hot Stuff, the Pure Cinnamon Oil, and that's exactly what I got when I ordered the 8 oz bottle of it from Olive Nation, using Amazon.com. It works so well that I ordered a larger bottle, the 16 oz version the next time I needed to get some more. BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU HAVEN'T EVER USED THIS CINNAMON OIL, OR IF IT HAS BEEN AWHILE SINCE YOU'VE USED IT ---you can burn your lips and tongue if you are not careful. YES, I know this from experience! My suggestion is to start small ---- put several toothpicks in the oil for six hours. Take them out and let them air-dry (caution: don't dry them on paper or cloth towels or the towels will absorb much of the oil.) I dry them on mosquito netting. Try those. If that's not hot enough, double the soaking time. I normally leave mine in for 72 hours, then dry them for 48 hours. I've also found out that the flat toothpicks absorb better / quicker than the round ones. But you can chew on the round ones longer before they start to splinter. --- Good luck!

review/text: I bought this in order to create the cinnamon toothpicks I remember buying as a kid. My sister and I could spend a dime each (or a quarter if they were really strong) for super-hot toothpick that would last for hours. I found the intensely strong cinnamon oil I was looking for and have already had several flashbacks. This stuff is seriously potent - be careful when handling. Wash hands or use vinyl gloves - don't get it near your eyes, or even on your skin/lips/tongue unintentionally. The 10 cent toothpicks were soaked overnight and the 25 cent ones for several days.  Man do I miss the 80s - Enjoy!!

Even the label on the bottle they sent is different to the one on Amazon. Don't get me wrong,this stuff is Potent and will burn your hands if you are not carefull but it has no smell. And what is point of it if you don't get that classic Cinnamon scent? Only Cinnamon Bark oil will give you that. Compared to Cinnamon Bark Oil you can't smell this stuff. I wanted this stuff for my house, after seing them used in hotel in Sri Lanka (where the best Cinnamon Oil comes from)but I might as well throw it.

review/summary: Not quite LorAnn quality, but for the price it's good quality.
review/text: Say you want to demolish a small house. An nuclear weapon will get the job as well as anything so why not use it? Just because it works doesn't mean it's the best solution or the most cost effective. A nice chunk of C4 might work just fine. This stuff is C4. I've been a consumer of LorAnn Cinnamon oil for over 20 years and I've never found anything as potent or as expensive.<br /><br />For 8oz, $25 was too cheap NOT to try. I entirely expected to be disappointed but for the chance I wasn't, $25 was worth the risk. I'm accustomed to paying ~$2.50 for 1/8oz (1dram) of LorAnn oil which is ~$20/oz. That makes this product 8 times cheaper. In my opinion the flavor is about 90% and potency is about 85% that of LorAnn's version. Since LorAnn oil is powerful enough to actually cause dangerous reactions (like extremely hot chili peppers), that can actually be a good thing. I'm conditioned to both well enough to consume things most people wouldn't dare try and this oil is still strong enough that I handle it carefully. The flavor is a bit more like that of "RedHot" hard candies rather than overly-intense cinnamon (which is the best way I can describe LorAnn cinnamon oil).<br /><br />If you're into cinnamon toothpicks or candy flavoring, I can't imagine this being anything less than sufficient and for 1/8th the cost, you have to at leave give it a shot. They have smaller quantities if you don't want to risk $25.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'll ever spend the premium for LorAnn again now that I've had this, but then again, I have the equivalent of 64 drams now and I don't think I've used that much cinnamon oil so far in my life so it'll be a while before I have to purchase again :) The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it's not a 100% substitute for LorAnn cinnamon oil, but I wish I could give a 4.5 or 4.75 stars instead of just 4 out of 5.

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: My wife said she couldn't find good cinnamon oil for her candy at the grocery store anymore and was in a panic because the grandkids were asking for some of her home made cinnamon candy. So I searched the Internet. I've had good luck with Amazon so I started there to see what I could find and to read the reviews. There were a lot of positive reviews on the OliveNation Cinnamon oil sold by Jr Mushrooms & Specialties so I ordered a 4 ounce bottle. When it arrived I opened the bottle, took a whiff and dipped a toothtick on the bottle for a taste. WOW!..This is the REAL DEAL!!!!! If you looking for a good Cinnamon Oil, you just found it.

review/summary: Love It
review/text: I'm a huge fan for cinnamon. The taste, the smell, and the sight is enough to make my mouth water. I purchased this cinnamon oil for no other reason but to have some delicious cinnamon oil at home. If you're worried about wasting your money on weak cinnamon oil, then you should definitley have no worries with this stuff. After seeing the reviews and how people make cinnamon toothpicks, I decided to do it too. Let me tell you, after washing my hands (with soap) then doing the dishes, my fingers still smelled (and tasted) like cinnamon! This stuff is really strong, and the toothpicks will just about burn a hole in your lip if you leave it sitting there. These toothpicks are great to carry in a mint tin to use after a large, garlic/onion meal. And since it's pure cinnamon oil and not candy or gum with sugars, its great for your teeth, digestive system, and breath without leaving a nasty aftertaste. All in all, this is great oil; a bit pricey but worth it. Also, the oil you soak the toothpicks in can be resused over and over again, as long as the container is sealed shut; so I can see this oil lasting for a very long time.

review/summary: The best tasting decaf T-Disc
review/text: As background, I have had my Tassimo Coffeemaker for over a year and use it daily. My favorite use is a final cup of coffee in the evening after dinner. Rather than make an entire pot, the T-Disc permit a freshly brewed single cup.<br /><br />Although I am not a total fanatic, when making a full pot, I do grind coffee beans just before brewing coffee, use filtered water, and keep everything quite clean in order to obtain the best taste possible. My preference is strong bold coffee. When it comes to T-Discs I normally stick with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WD93EW">Starbucks Africa Kitamu Coffee (Bold), 12-Count T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers (Pack of 2) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WDCAJ2">Starbucks Caffe Verona Coffee (Bold), 12-Count T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers (Pack of 2) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]. Of course, the difference between what one person thinks is good and another thinks is drek, is, well, a matter of taste.<br /><br />After dinner, I've often reached my caffeine limit for the day. Currently, there are only two decaffeinated T-Discs available -- Maxwell House and Gevalia. Normally I probably would not buy Maxwell House coffee but after plowing through a free sampler pack of Gevalia T-discs that was included with my Tassimo, I found the taste too harshly acidic. Perhaps with cream and sugar it is improved? I don't know, but since I drink my coffee black, it's irrelevant.<br /><br />I find the Maxwell House disc to be smooth and surprisingly good. I realize that different notes in coffee appeal to different palates, so keep that in mind. I certainly hope the future brings other decaffeinated varieties to choose from, but for the time being, I am quite happy.

review/summary: Disappointing!...REVISED
review/text: Flat, flavorless, weak. Don't bother unless you like your coffee really weak. I'd guess a fair description would be using 4 tablespoons of coffee in a regular coffee maker with water for 8 5oz cups. I'm looking for my Tassimo manual to see if there's a way to reduce the water used so I could perhaps get a half-cup of decaf at an acceptable strength.<br /><br />REVISED:<br />I found the manual. Simply push the start/stop button after brewing has started to stop the process earlier (making the coffee stronger). At 2/3 cup, the strength is just about right. I now rate this product 3 stars.

review/text: ...and that's the most positive thing I have to say for this product.  There aren't a lot of choices for decaf for the Tassimo at the moment, but this is not the choice I'd make again.  I brewed a cup, immediately added some sugar and real half & half, stirred, put the cup to my lips and I tasted... bad noodles from Panda Express in liquid form.  Now, normally I would make decaf Cafe Verona or decaf House Blend from Starbucks either in a regular coffee maker or a french press, but I'm not terribly picky; I will drink a cup of decaf from Denny's or Friendly's or wherever, and enjoy it.  This was not remotely enjoyable.<br /><br />I was originally going to give it 2 stars since it nearly tastes like coffee, but after writing this review I've realized there is not a redeeming quality to it.  I will only serve this to someone I don't like when I want them to leave my house.

review/text: Is this actually coffee? I have tried 14 different coffees for my tassimo, and this Maxwell House decaf is the only one which tastes so foul that I have discarded the remaining T-discs. I would love to be able to describe the taste as 'too mild' or 'too rich' or 'too bitter', but I can't. It just doesn't taste like coffee - more like I imagine a very weak mochachino might taste without any milk. If you must have decaf for your tassimo - stick with the Gevalia, it isn't great, but its 10 times better than this.

Unfortunately the only two options are the swill they package as Maxwell House and Gevalia - though I suspect they're the same coffee with different labels - they both taste exactly the same and that's NOT a good thing!<br /><br />This decaf is so bad, it has forced me to do the unthinkable ... give up on my beloved Tassimo machine and switch to a Keurig brewer instead.  My Tassimo and all of the caffeinated discs are packaged up in the Keurig box and sitting in the basement now.<br /><br />Tassimo you have lost a fan and loyal user of your product because you failed me in a major area - providing a great tasting decaffeinated coffee option.
