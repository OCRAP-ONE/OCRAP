review/summary: OK not great
review/text: I was expecting the beef stick to be like one of the pictured multipacks with a natural looking sausage type snack that is a little thick.  Instead, these individually wrapped sticks are very long but small diameter.  As such, much of the texture is the casing and not the meat.  I also wish the Original flavor was a little more peppery.

review/summary: I love this item and the bulk packaging is a big plus!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that these product by Jack Links are very attractively priced and fulfill a specific snacking need for me. When I read that these were bulk packed and that I would not have all this additional packaging to dispose of, I was really pleased. I am not a conservationist extroadinaire or particularly green, but there is no reason for something like this to have to be ind. wrapped. I always keep reusable containers around for when I tote a snack with me or send one with a family member, it just makes sense. These dried meat snacks will not get ruined by being opened and dried out a little further!<br /><br />The taste is totally what I expected compared to ind. wrapped store purchased items. I will definitely repeat!

review/summary: Tastes okay, but the 'end result' is not worth it.
review/text: My wife originally ate one a few weeks ago and told me about how the next day she had sharp stomach pains and spent quite a bit of time in the bathroom.  I didn't think much of it and I ended up buying one for myself (admittedly by mistake, I just wanted a regular beef stick).  They taste okay; the spiciness is interesting that it has sort of a delay but, it does seem to stick around long after the burn starts.<br /><br />However, the next day I woke up out of a deep sleep from sharp pains in my stomach and had to use the bathroom twice.  And the pains are very sharp, I had to keep clenching my stomach and I was rocking back and forth.  I feel bad that my wife had to experience this during work!<br /><br />tl;dr: Tastes okay, but the 'end result' is not worth it... unless you've been constipated for weeks and have grown desperate for a cure, you'll probably not want to experience the end results of this delicious beef stick.

review/text: I am an aficionado of chili. In fact, I cannot remember any chili -- canned or otherwise -- that I actually despised. This particular product is at the top of my list of favorites. It is so good, I order it by the case from Amazon.com. Still, if you like your chili "hot" (I don't), then skip this one. It does have all the other flavors, however, which appeal to my taste -- and to friends with whom I have shared this too guarded secret. C'mon Stagg, turn your advertising department loose! It's hard to find this product in my local markets.

Now she is starting to itch a little and we have had her allergy tested so we can see if she is developing any allergies to the ingredients in this food... then we may have to find a new one... otherwise, we will continue on it.  I don't know who that one person thinks they are calling this low quality organic, how the heck do they know what kind of quality it is?  I think they are a competitor.  Well, since anyone can say anything, I say First Mate is high quality premium dog food.

review/text: As a pet enthusiast, I appreciate when a manufacturer cares about the animal and not just the profits.  First Mate has their own factory and sources their products from North America. They formulate their food to be holistic, basically, what the dog needs and nothing else.  Their food is balanced and not trendy like many of the high protein diets.  Best of all...my dogs eat it!  I cannot tell you how many times I have purchased high end foods that my dogs won't go near.

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: My dog loves this food and it has really cut back on the tear staining issues.  The staining was a big problem and I did quite a bit of research to find a solution. I considered a few products that you add to the dog food or come in pill form and several of these apparently  work however many of them are actually antibiotics I am not sure it is a good idea to use very often.  My research  led me to antioxidants (like blueberries) and avoiding wheat to cut back on the tear stains and give him a healthier coat. This food is not only grain free but is also loaded with blueberries.<br /><br />Yes, the first ingredient is potato however in FirstMate's defense, most companies include several non-protein ingredients so that they can put them lower down on the list thus making it look like there is more protein than anything else.  Also, meat "meal" is a much more concentrated protein than regular meat (somewhere in the range of 300% more concentrated).

Unfortunately, purchasing this product through Amazon is sometimes a bit of a problem because it's not always immediately available.  I found a Petsmart Store which carries it, but the store is twenty miles away and the product is not all that inexpensive there either.

review/text: This is not a sausage, this is paste in a plastic tube which is shaped like a sausage. Then you cut the tube off and you're left with a log of mash. As one other reviewer mentioned, it'd be better (and more honest) if this came in a tub.<br /><br />The taste is fine, but not remarkable in any way. I'm not sure how this product is better than you putting tofu, TSP and spices in a blender and then shaping it like poop.<br /><br />Usually vegan fake meats are at least texturally close, and while they can't approximate meat exactly they are at least trying. Soyrizo makes no attempt (other than the plastic packaging) at being what it claims to replace.<br /><br />It is a pain in the butt to cook as it has no structure at all, and it burns readily. I cooked half at a high temperature like the packaging suggested - it burned quickly! Then I cooked the other half at a low temperature, cut up into smaller poops so I could roll them over. Regardless of how long it was cooked, it did not dry out or become more solid.<br /><br />I was very very disappointed by this Soyrizo and will not buy it again.

review/summary: Donut House Decaf Coffee k-cups
review/text: Liked this decaf brand.  I find that we can get 2 separate beverage servings from 1 k-cup.  Make sure you squeeze & shake the k-cup before reusing, and punch an new hole in the bottom, don't try to line up the first hole.  Really works, second cup will be a bit weaker.

review/summary: best light decaf
review/text: I am pregnant and have been enjoying a variety of decaf coffees for the last 9 months.  This coffee is the absolute best in decaf for Keurig.  I have tried probably 20+ different flavors and I can say with complete confidence this is my favorite.  I have had the Donut House regular and it is awesome as well.  I've drank it with cream hot and over ice.  Listen--I drink coffee every single day of my life since for like 15 years; I know what I'm talking about. decaf, regular, fresh ground, folgers, french press, hospital cafeteria, peculated, drip, instant, starbucks, dunkin donuts, Caribou, Gloria Jean's, mcdonalds--you name it I've had it.  This machine with this coffee is perfect for a decaf drinker.<br /><br />Decaf can sometimes have an icky taste, this has a coffee house aroma and a smooth taste, not bitter or dirty or chalky.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: I've read the reviews from people who have had problems - and Amazon currently shows this note:<br />"Item Under Review<br />While this item is available from other marketplace sellers on this page, it is not currently offered by Amazon.com because customers have told us there may be something wrong with our inventory of the item, the way we are shipping it, or the way it's described here.

Then I bought 3 boxes on 8/1 - I haven't had any problems with them yet, either.<br /><br />That's good, because this is by far my favorite decaf.  I hope they get the problems fixed quickly - I'd hate to have to settle for something else.<br /><br />This blend is made by Green Mountain - I think they usually make a quality product.

review/summary: Favorite so far
review/text: I just re-ordered this decaf coffee.  We have tried several decaf varieties looking for that perfect cup.  The Donut House is our reigning favorite.  We had been drinking Donut SHOP decaf and just tried Green Mountain Breakfast Blend decaf.  While both of these coffees are pleasant, neither compares to the Donut House in aroma or flavor.  This coffee is full bodied in taste and very smooth.  We brew it on the 8oz setting and think that is perfect, although we make the next size larger for my mother who likes her's a bit weaker.  We'll probably keep looking for the perfect decaf; this one is excellent.

review/summary: Decaf Coffee
review/text: I wanted to try a decaf coffee for after dinner and found the Donut House Decaf to be very good.  I was a little leery because it was labelled Extra Bold - Light Roast.  Wasn't sure what that label meant - was it going to be very strong (extra bold) or was it going to taste too weak (light roast)?  I don't like real strong coffee or weak coffee, so I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't taste too strong or too weak, as Goldilocks said "it was just right!"  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.

Now I know that I must watch closely and examine each and every one as I load it into my machine to make sure it is what I think it is so I am not so disappointed in the future.  I won't buy from here again.  Someone is responsible for the switch.  I expect to get what I pay for.

review/summary: Donut House K cup
review/text: One of the best we have tried and continue to use.  It seems that most of the K cups have very little coffee in them and as a result are very weak...Donut house if very good.  We first tried a Keurig system and took it back because the coffees that came with it, mostly Green Mountain, were no where near as good as our old coffee maker...and we don't make strong coffee.  We then tried a sample of some others at the store and thought to try the Keurig again.  THis time we purchased a decaf sampler kit from Amazon and found that Donut House and Caribu were the best.  We now enjoy our Keurig much better.

review/summary: Really good decaf.
review/text: I'm not big on writing reviews, but since this product has such a wide variety of reviews I thought I'd add my own thoughts.  I was looking for a good, mild decaf coffee for myself and to offer friends in the evening and that is exactly what I received.<br /><br />Does the picture say "extra bold"? Yes, but everything else about the product in the description says that it's a "light roast"...not to mention the scathing 1 star reviews stating that it's not extra bold even though the picture says it is. Take an extra 30 seconds next time and read through the description and maybe some reviews before spending your money. That is a technical error and shouldn't be held against the quality of the actual product in the review.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased with the coffee as I do not like dark roasts - so if you are like minded, I believe you will enjoy this coffee, and hey - the price is right, too.  There aren't too many k-cups you can get for around .50/cup.

review/text: BUYERS BEWARE - I guess it's my fault I really thought when I ordered this coffee I was gettinng TWO BOXES of coffee for 22.50 like almost every other coffee dealer on Amazon sells this stuff for. But this guy sells this coffee for 22.50 for ONE!!!!! box of coffee.When it arrived at my house I asked my wife where the other box was and she said: "Thats It just one box arrived!" I looked my order over and sure enough he does sell it for 1 box of coffee for 22.50 making this probably the MOST expensive k-cup coffee on Amazon. So shame on me for not looking the order over before I purchased it. If you look at all the other sellers, their coffee is 23.00 for TWO BOXES OF 25 count k-cups. Thats 50 k-cups. This guy only gives you 25 k-cups for 22.50 which is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!!!!! congratulations you fooled me, but I hope this review warns others off.

Now I'm a fan, and I hope Amazon keeps carrying it.

review/summary: Not what I ordered, I think.
review/text: I though that everything was fine as the first one I took out of the box matched the illustration exactly.  None of the others matched the illustration.  They do not say "EXTRA BOLD" on the cups at all, but the sticker on the box does actually say extra bold.<br />It's been a while since I tried one of these, so I wasn't sure if they just mislabeled them, decided they weren't "extra bold" to begin with, or they are jsut pranksters.  At any rate, I took off two stars because I suspect that they pulled a fast one at the factory.

review/text: Very dissappointed to find out I only get 1 box of 24 KCups. Almost $1 a cup. I usually get 2 boxes for this price. CRAZY!!! I buy these online because they are much cheaper than stores. I did not receive the right flavor and shipping seemed to take very long. Not happy!!!

review/text: I thought I ordered a bold decaf but this is what was delivered.  I opened one to try it out and do not like it but am now stuck with it because I opened the box.  This product needs to be labeled properly and CLEARLY.  If you like a mild roast, this is for you.

review/summary: They keep sending me Dacaf "Light Roast" coffee!
review/text: This is not Decaf "Extra Bold". Something is wrong with the computer or the person shipping the product. They have sent Decaf "Light Roast" twice in place of Decaf "Extra Bold". This really needs to be fixed. I sent back the first order. The second order they decided to overnight to me to make up for the mistake. I know the second time it also said Decaf "Light Roast" on the box, but I opened it anyway in hope it was just marked wrong on the outside box and inside would be the correct product. No such luck. I now have coffee I don't want. I'm sure the Decaf Extra Bold is great coffee but if they can't send it I can't try it!!!

review/text: I have to say that my case of chips arrived in perfect condition. I was a little concerned when I went to order them, but was pleasantly surprised on the care given. There was an outside box and the chips were in a separate chip case inside.  Then the entire thing was placed in a clear plastic bag.  The chips themselves are the best that I have ever had.  The sweet onion taste is great!!!! Only problem is that you can't find these particular chips anywhere in New York.  The other random flavors are there, but the Sweet Onion have mysteriously disappeared. Too bad.  I will have to keep ordering them via mail.

review/summary: Our Favorite Canned Lentils
review/text: These are our favorite canned lentils. Some of the other canned lentils we have tried have had larger than expected beans, but these are a much smaller bean. We originally found these at our local Whole Foods, but they were often sold out or in low supply. Needless to say, we were very happy to find that Amazon also stocks these lentils, although they are often in low supply here as well. These lentils make a great substitute for using dried lentils and are awesome for anyone following a Slow Carb diet, such as the diet described by Tim Ferriss in his book Four Hour Body. This product is imported from Italy.

review/summary: Better than anything you've ever had
review/text: The beef jerky you get at the store, the stuff you see advertised on TV, is nothing compared to this.  I'll never buy that crap again.  I hate the sugary taste of that jerky with its sometimes squishy texture.  This is salty, slightly spicy, sink your teeth into, beefy goodness; just like jerky should be.  My only regret is that it is actually MORE expensive online than in my hometown in PA.  Regardless, the price is a drawback because it is likely this package will disappear quickly, especially with a family, but quite possibly by yourself.  Can't stop at one piece!  Try this jerky and you will judge all others by it.

I eat this stuff a stick at a time, so I was a little nervous about ordering so much, but I just put it in zip lock bags and it kept just fine for 60 days or so.<br /><br />Taste-wise this stuff gets a 9/10 for me.<br />Quality is 9/10 as well.<br />Spiciness (I like spicy jerky) is only a 4/10.

review/text: I usually brew with the individual components, and ordered this not realizing it was 2 large cans that you simply poor into the carboy and add yeasr.  It is perfect for beginners.  For more advanced brewers, I would keep on looking<br /><br />For a stout, it is a little on less alcoholic side, I would recommend adding a bit more dextrose towards the end of the fermentation to keep the fermentation going or closely observe the specific gravity.<br /><br />Taste of good, but unremarkable.

review/text: This review is about Musselmans apple cider purchased at Walmart.  This cider has the same poor taste that I experienced with Whitehouse apple juice last year.  In the case of the Whitehouse brand I found that, despite the proudly displayed American flag on the label, the juice was actually from China.  I would bet $10 that the Musselmans juice is from China despite the label saying otherwise.  I remember having great tasting cider when I was a kid in Pennsylvania. Doesn't seem to exist anymore.

review/summary: The classic!
review/text: Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation." Oscar Wilde.
