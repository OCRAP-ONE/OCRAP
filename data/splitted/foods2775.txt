review/text: Love these Foldgers coffee bags, especially for traveling. Especially when I go to Europe. Can't drink their coffee. It is just too strong. So this is a perfect solution. I also take it with me when I visit my kids overnight. They are not coffee drinkers so this is a perfect solution for my morning coffee. It is difficult to find the decaf in stores.

review/summary: Happy Husband
review/text: My husband has been drinking Folgers Decaf for years, and uses the singles in particular since I don't drink coffee.  Besides the convenience and savings, the taste is what he loves.  I have read other reviews about Folgers Decaf singles complaining about the bitterness, but hubby has tried several other brands and always returns to Folgers Decaf singles.  I suspect these people are expresso fans or want their coffee brewed.  It appears the majority of coffee drinkers are in concert with them as it has become more difficult to find Folgers Decaf singles the past couple years.  That is where Amazon comes in.  There was a period of time when I could not find Folgers Decaff singles anywhere.  Just out of curiosity I checked Amazon's website.  Not only were the decaff singles available, but cheaper than the store's price when purchased in bulk, qualifying for free shipping and handling.  So my review is a five star.  Thank you!

review/text: I, like others that submitted reviews did not read the description carfully enough.  These are NOT for the Keurig K-Cup dispenser, rather than are single packets of coffee sealed individually.<br /><br />Big disappointment on the purchase, but after reading the description again, it really was my fault.  I didn't try the coffee, so I can't attest to the taste.<br /><br />The regular which was in k-cup packaging that was purchased at the same time is okay, not great, just okay.<br /><br />Just tried to return the UNOPENED item and find that it is not eligible for return.  This is the first time I bumped into this with Amazon.  Now I am more upset about the misleading search results, etc.

review/summary: Conveniant, may replace instant coffee for good
review/text: This is true decaf, no caffeine issues for me. Very convenient when I am by myself and do not want to make a whole pot. A quick and easy way to make a single cup, easier than making a cup of tea, but very similar in its little teabag. They claim it is not instant coffee, but real coffee ground in such a way to "fresh brew" in your cup. It is nice not to have to stir in the instant and have brown floaties at the top of my cup. If you are looking for the fresh brew taste, this is somewhere between using a coffee pot or instant coffee. It is a lot cleaner than using the coffeemaker or the instant. Odd that both and Folgers and Maxwell House  picked the number 19 for the amount of bags to put in the box, seem like they would have rounded it off at 20. I do not use it for camping, as I just have to have the aroma and ritual of the pot.

review/summary: Generously Delicious
review/text: I am a long-time pod user, have owned 5 different machines, tried every pod brand there is, and even made my own with coffee filters. I liked Baronet's but haven't had them in quite a while.<br /><br />The Pods<br />These are not Baronet's monster pods, but they are much more generously, tightly and consistently filled than the grocery store kind. I have been using them in a Cuisinart Cup-O-Matic and a Simple Human Pod Brewer A40. I get a full 8 ounce flavorful cup and the best results possible for each machine. As I near the end of the order, so far not one has been broken, sealed into its packet edge or otherwise unusable. The individual packets are always easy to open, and they display attractively in a counter top container.<br /><br />The Coffee Flavor<br />As the name implies, Nutty Irishman is a blend of Irish creme and hazelnut. If you like those flavors and prefer a breakfast blend, doughnut shop or yellow-arches coffee over a dark roast *bucks, you will likely enjoy these as much as I do.<br /><br />I've yet to find a perfect pod coffee maker, but I think I've just found the perfect pod. Baronet Nutty Irishman is Number One on my list.

review/text: I own a Senseo machine and was using Senseo brand coffee for a full year before I found the Baronet coffees on Amazon.  I buy this Nutty Irishman and a decaf and they are delivered to me monthly at a price cheaper than the Senseo at Target (which is the cheapest I have found for the Senseo brand).  The thing that really sells this for me is the amount of coffee per pod - much more than the other pods on the market.  Not all Baronet pods are this super size...be sure to check the weight.  There is a good 30% more coffee in these pods than the other brands.

The coffee has a nice Irish Cream/Nut flavor to it.  It just is a bit weak for me on actual coffee flavor.  I have tried using two pods - one of these with one dark roast unflavored coffee.  Adding the second dark roast pod makes it pretty decent.

review/text: I like strolling the aisles of my local warehouse store because you never know what you might find. For example, last week I found some delicious dried cherries by Kirkland Signature in the snacks isle. I've always thought the KS brand was of the highest quality, so I snapped up a bag in an instant. They're a somewhat tart Montmorency Cherry, and they're excellent. They're nice and chewy and have a wonderful taste. I use them as deserts, pack them with lunches and take them along on camping trips. Plus, they're easy to store so there's good quality fruit around even during times when a trip to the local grocery store isn't possible. Excellent product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I also made granola bars using sliced almonds, these dried cherries, coconut, peanut butter and honey that is so good. Eating the dried cherries out of the bag is also a nice treat.<br /><br />These cherries are good for you.  They are tart with a little sweetness in them.

They make a wonderfully energizing snack at the office. Though I generally don't like added sugar on dried fruits, it's really necessary to counteract the cherries' naturally tart taste. Reconstituted, I'm guessing they'd be perfect for tart cherry pies. Certainly the flavor is everything I remember in a really good tart cherry pie, which is almost impossible to find these days.

review/summary: Not quite what I expected
review/text: I love dried cherries and part of the reason for that is that they have a bit of tang to them.  I bought some in bulk before I bought these, and I guess I expected them to be pretty much the same.  They're not.  These are monster mouth-puckering dried cherries.  And trust me, there's no way to tame a tart cherry. I wound up giving them to a friend because they made my mouth cry when I ate them.  But if you like really tart cherries, these are the ones for you!  The resealable bag is great, as long as you remember to squeeze out most of the air before you finish sealing the bag.  The cherries were soft and moist, which is a good thing for a dried cherry; so often they're cherry leather.  And each time I went back to the bag, they were still soft and moist, so the packaging is excellent for nibblers.  But remember, Kirkland has discovered the world's tartest cherries, so if you don't like them that way, don't buy these.  But if you do, run!  The price is great and the bag truly does keep them soft and most.

review/text: I love almonds in general, and this particular brand is quite good.  They taste great, with just the right amount of salt and oil (for me, anyway).<br /><br />They're individually packaged in 6 oz. cans, which makes them an easy and portable snack.  Portion control is also easier with the small can size.<br /><br />I've ordered a few packs of these almonds, and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch (some are roasted a bit darker than others), I have always found them fresh and tasty.<br /><br />Almonds are relatively healthy too - high in protein, a good source of magnesium, calcium, and manganese, and full of unsaturated fats.<br /><br />I haven't seen organic roasted, salted almonds from this company, but I hope they offer them eventually at a decent price.  One thing I would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of BPA.

review/text: Yup, no stray pieces, just whole brown almonds. Which is to say that these are not "blanched" - blanching being the process that removes the actual skin of the almond (not the husk) and leaves a pale buff-colored product. And the description of "lightly salted" is accurate. I can barely taste it. The can says the ingredients are almonds, vegetable oil (canola, safflower and/or sunflower) and salt. That's it. Gluten-free. Interestingly enough, there is no indication on either the can or their website whether these are raw or roasted. And I couldn't tell by eating them. But Blue Diamond responded to my email query, saying they are in fact oil roasted - have to be "Pasteurized", per a new California law. [You might want to know that this is a "light" roasting. I would say that it goes part way to a roasted flavor, remaining as healthy as possible while conforming to the legislation I mentioned. My taste preference is actually for the flavor of a fully roasted almond, bad me.]<br /><br />They taste fresh and almondy, as they should. They make a wonderful addition in both taste and appearance, to my just-created Nonpareil Trail Mix which is lo-carb and gluten-free as I am trying even harder to follow this kind of diet. I'm pleased to report that these Blue Diamond Almonds are properly dated: on the bottom of the can it says "BEST BEFORE JUL 20 14". That gives plenty of time to use up six little cans.<br /><br />And about the cans, they seem to be metal bottom and sides, making them superior for storage although the plastic replaceable top with sealed metallic foil under it might be breachable by the ubiquitous rodent. The little cans are nicely reusable.

review/summary: One of my very favorite flavors!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack. This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 2% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is the perfect one for you. This is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.

review/summary: Salted Almonds
review/text: If you like snacks that are a healthier alternative to other options, almonds are a great way to go.  These almonds are lightly salted and roasted.  They are absolutely delicious.  I could easily see getting in trouble with these since I could sit down and eat the whole can in a sitting and not even realize it.  I snack on them pretty much every morning to tide me over until lunch without having to eat a big meal or something very unhealthy for me.

review/text: The deal I got on these was amazing so that, combined with the fact that I love this brand of Almonds made ordering these no-brainer. I happen to love all of Blue Diamond's different flavors for their almonds. This flavor - Smokehouse is the best IMO. It's got just the right amount of smoky flavor to it without being overbearing. I believe this is Blue Diamond's best selling variety of Almonds. These come in 1.5 ounce packages and for me each package is good for 2-3 servings - about a handful each serving. Very tasty

review/summary: Purchased a bag with way too much salt - Company provided a replacement: almonds were perfect
review/text: Original review -- I thought I had purchased salt with almonds in it. The amount of salt is RIDICULOUS and very unhealthy. Almonds are a healthy snack but not if they are this salty.<br /><br />UPDATE -- I contacted the company and they provided a replacement. The new bag was perfect, the almonds were tasty and not too salty. It seems that I purchased a bag from a bad batch. The company was prompt at correcting the problem. I originally gave the product a 1 star rating, I'm updating the review and giving the product 4 stars.

review/text: I love nuts of all kinds, and eat some almonds and walnuts every day. I've tried all the brands of almonds--salted, unsalted, raw, dry-roasted, spiced, cocoa covered, you name it. These are by far the tastiest of all brands and types I've tried. Great texture, a hint of salt...just right. The only problem with these is that they're so delicious its hard to stop eating them. Plus, Amazon beats the store price. Love them...

Good with cocktails, good by the handful. I've snacked on them before dinner, watching tv, having a drink, or at bedtime. And did I mention the price? The 3 pack is so much cheaper than buying singles at the grocerystore. All round great snack!

I would prefer them over the regular salted almonds any day!  I have no idea why anyone would want to put MORE salt on these delicious nuts.<br /><br />The three-count 16-ounce bags (with Prime shipping) pop on and off of Amazon - buy them when they are available.  Otherwise you must buy the six-pack of small cans, at a higher price per ounce.

They are very smokey-don't leave an open package in your car, like I did...It made my car smell like cigarettes.  However, this is unlikely to happen as it is hard to only eat part of the package as they are so good.

review/text: ...but the cans were smaller than I expected for the price I paid.  I dunno, I just expected to be saving a lot more than that when buying in bulk.  It's the same price (about $3 a can) at the local Target.  Plus, and this is a personal problem, I had a hard time being conservative with em.  They are delicious (not as good as the smoked ones though which Amazon doesn't sell for some reason) and I couldn't stop eating them!  I went through two cans in the first night!  I love to snack, but almonds aren't the best for snacking in large quantities, and I won't explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.  Anyways, the nuts are perfectly fine and it's a decent price (considering you're not paying sales tax outside of NY and that there's free shipping if you're patient) so I can't not recommend them, although I will never buy em again in this quantity.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: DESCRIPTION:<br />> Blue Diamond Roasted-Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are "heart healthy" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself.  Roasted Salted Almonds are available in bags or small cans small.<br />> Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are similar with wonderful smokey flavor.  At this time Smokehouse Almonds are available from Amazon only in 16 oz (and smaller) bags.<br />> I have not tried the "lightly salted" variety but I presume that they have almost no salt.<br /><br />CANS vs BAGS<br />Various types of Blue Diamond Almonds are available in bags or small cans.  The small cans (3 1/4" in diameter by 2 3/8" high) are very convenient and assure that the almonds stay fresh until openned, and afterward, because they don't stay "openned" long (it is easy to eat a whole can at one setting).  Arguably the bags more environmentally friendly, but you don't get much of a price break for the much cheaper packaging.  I prefer the convenience and freshness of the cans.<br /><br />EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful.  Well roasted and crunchy.  I cannot decide which I like best: the Roasted Salted or the Smokehouse.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  I happen to like the roasted-in-oil flavor.<br /><br />LESS ROASTED ALMONDS<br />If you prefer less-roasted almonds, roasted without added oil, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COJ85G">Back To Nature California Almonds, Sea Salt Roasted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />UNROASTED ALMONDS<br />Unroasted almonds are available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COE1AI">Back To Nature California Almonds, Unroasted & Unsalted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> but beware that thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.  Unroasted almonds are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.  While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds, (which have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods).  Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer.  Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw.  7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child.  Moreover, a child raised on raw almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) are safe to eat---they are NOT.  The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds.

review/summary: So much better than the other Taco Seasoning
review/text: I really don't like tacos that much, but everyone else in my house does so I make them anyway. But I found this at Target and thought that it sounded like it would be healthier than the other packaged seasonings and it might taste better too. It couldn't be any worse.<br /><br />I used it with ground turkey and it was great! I even liked it. It is not just salt and MSG. In fact there is no MSG in it at all and that is rare in taco seasonings.<br /><br />I went back later and Target no longer carried this product so I bought one of the other packets of seasonings. It was terrible and I began the search for this. When I found it locally, I bought half of what was on the shelf! Now that I know I can get it here, I'm sure I will order it from Amazon.<br /><br />My family and I highly recomend the Taco Fresco seasoning. It tastes more like what you get at a good Mexican resterant.

The Black Beans and Rice, Cuban Style Black Bean Soup was delicious, and the Taco Fresco is nothing short of amazing. I was so lucky to have been introduced to their products, Nueva Cocina will be the only brand I will use from here on out.

review/summary: REAL taco seasoning!
review/text: This taco seasoning is wonderful on so many levels. I had not tried this specific one, as I usually get the Chipotle Taco, which is a blend of smoky and sweet. This one is more in line with the "traditional" seasonings, but oh so much better. The depths and freshness of the seasonings really show and livened up our ground chicken perfectly. There is a very mild spice to this mix, but no real "heat". I can tend to have a 'sensitive' stomach to many latin seasonings, but I find NONE of Nueva's products have done that AT ALL, so I am able to enjoy and not regret it!

review/summary: Wonderful flavor
review/text: My family loves taco nights, but we don't make them often enough to justify buying bottles of seasoning that won't get used within a year so I use packaged seasoning mixes for them.<br />This one is hands down the best we've ever tried. The flavors are very clean, no msg.<br />I don't follow package directions for tacos, my family likes them made from chicken breasts, so what I do is slice up 2.5 lbs of chicken, one finely sliced onion and 3 cloves of garlic and brown it, then add two packets with a 15 ounce can of tomato sauce and a half can of water. Let that simmer for a half hour and serve up tacos. This makes more than enough meat for my family, plus leftovers for lunch the next day.<br />An absolute hit with my family. It's a mild seasoning so everyone just adds pepper to taste.

review/text: Our dog is older and has arthritis.  He has a hard time getting around sometimes.  After we started giving him these treats with glucosamine, he visibly improved.  He is a little quicker, and gets around much more easily.  I know that vets say that they are not sure if glucosamine helps, but from my personal experience it definitely does.  Plus - it is much easier to get him to eat these treats than something in pill form - he loves the way these taste and gets excited when he hears us opening the bag.  They are a little pricey - but absolutely worth it in my opinion!!

review/text: I'm always in the search for snacks that might be tasty and nutritionally good for you at the same time. It's a difficult search. Here's one find: "Majans Bhuja Cracker Mix." It's an assortment of small rice crackers, crisp noodles, green peas, peanuts, chickpeas and an assortment of flavors and minor ingredients. It's crunchy and good, like a good snack should be. The calories are not particularly high. It has a good protein and fiber content. It's low fat with no cholesterol and the sodium content is fairly low, even though it tastes salty. Nice mix. Oh, I might add that it's fairly filling so that I've had no tendency to eat the whole bag at one sitting, It's a product of Australia and I discovered it in a nearby Fresh and Easy store. It's good to find a few things like this.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.<br /><br />All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.<br /><br />I love all 3 drinks. But, if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Milo from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Milo is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, I love Milo for it's good mix of chocolate and malt, not too much of either, and a great comfort drink for cold nights.

review/text: I bought this product for my Aide, who has lived in a few different countries and they always had Milo.  I had never heard of it and we couldn't find it in our local CT stores.  The directions call for using a quarter cup of warm water to liquify 3 level tablespoons of the powder and then add warm or cold water or whole cream milk and sweeten to your taste.  I found it faintly reminiscent of the Carnation Instand Breakfast I drank many years ago, as a teenager.  It has a chocolate flavor, slightly malty but grainy.  The flavor is not as malty as Ovaltine.  I'll have to see if they still make the Carnation Instant Breakfast, that was good with milk.<br /><br />So, overall it only rates 3 stars because it's good but not great or fantastic!

review/summary: Old beans
review/text: Beans arrived promptly but the "best before" use date was less than 1 month from time of purchase. These were old roasts and don't make for good Flavor upon grinding.at least in store purchases display the use date on the package. This vendor sells old roasts.
