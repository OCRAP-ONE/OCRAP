review/summary: Tasty - easy to prepare - one of Lipton's best side dishes
review/text: Boil some water and throw the contents of the packet in. About 7 minutes later you have a tasty side dish.<br /><br />Preparation could not be easier and the results are not bad - no off tastes and while not gourmet, nevertheless, this is a quality side dish<br /><br />I've tried most (if not all) of the Lipton side dishes. This is one of my favorites. None of the Lipton side dishes are bad but they are often bland. This one stands out along with their Alfredo and Stroganoff.<br /><br />Well worth a try.

review/summary: The product is terrific, the packaging much less so
review/text: I've been using this Lipton Teriyaki Rice product for years to mix with steamed vegetables for a filling meal, but lately my local grocery stores have stopped carrying it. I thought buying it through Amazon would be a convenient way to go.<br /><br />I thought it had been a good idea until I opened the box of a dozen packages to find that three of the packages hadn't been properly sealed and were open along one side. One package had dumped rice and seasonings all over the other packages and had made an sticky mess in the box. The remaining, still-sealed packages needed to be cleaned off in order to safely store them for later use without attracting insects.<br /><br />This purchase turned out not to be much of a bargain or very convenient since three of the 12 packages were defective and had to be discarded plus the time involved in clean-up.<br /><br />I can only hope that this was a one-off and that I was simply unlucky to get such a mess, but it does show that there are some problems with the quality control in the packaging department of the manufacturer. It's not Amazon's fault, but it makes me hesitant to buy this pre-boxed product through them again.

review/summary: Do you like dehydrated onion?
review/text: The predominant flavor in the Knorr Teriyaki rice is dehydrated onion/leek. The ingredients list says dried leek and onion powder. It is just too much. It tastes like the bad dehydrated meals we used to eat on several day backpacking trips when I was a child.<br /><br />Other people love this as I can see from the reviews. I would say that you should consider what sort of palate you have to figure out whether you are in the love it or hate it group. If you are like me, then you think fast food tastes disgusting. You also think stevia tastes bitter, artificial sweeteners taste like poison, and you can taste every or almost every ingredient in a dish. You could probably recreate almost anything you have eaten just from taste alone. Did it have a dash of chili powder in it? Yep, you could taste it. Was it made with pickled hot peppers instead of fresh ones? You can tell just by taste. Was it made with crisco instead of butter? You know immediately. If that is you, you will hate this product.<br /><br /> One hour and a peach smoothie later and I still can't get the onion taste out of my mouth. A further glass of lemonade later, still tasting dehydrated/powdered onion.

review/text: I bought this wine kit because I wanted to find a nice white wine that I could let age a while before I gave it to any family or friends.  When this wine was complete, it tasted a little thin to me.  However, 3.5 months of aging brought it a lot way and it tastes wonderful.  I highly recommend this kit if you just want to make a batch of wine to age and enjoy down the road.  I can only imagine how good it will taste in another 6 months to a year.

review/text: This isn't Debra, it's husband Mike. I just finished bottling my Niersteiner. The kit called for a finish of 30 bottles (6 gallons) but I made it a 5 gallon finish instead and the wine tastes very good, like a Riesling a little bit, but Niersteiner comes from a different grape. Made 5 gallons because with the amount of juice the kit has I felt the wine would be thin and I plan on entering this wine in competitions. I also made a tannin addition to the wine which adds to the rich flavor but it also made the wine throw a slight pectin haze visible if you hold a bottle to the light. I would and have reccomended these kits to friends and currently have 3 other Reserve Du Chateau kits going, one of them being another Niersteiner. These kits are a good value, included are corks, labels and caps. Visit my blog at: [...].

review/summary: Yum. The best Gummis available in the US.
review/text: I'll admit, I am a gummi snob.  I've been devouring these little guys since the 1960's, when they were only available when my Oma sent a few packages from Europe.  Those gummis were flavored and colored naturally with fruit, and so fresh that they practically melted in your mouth.<br /><br />These are nearly as wonderful. Naturally, they are artificially colored, since the 1960's are long gone, but they are flavored with fruit, and taste so fresh that you can't really compare them to any other candy.  The only quality that is different than the Gummi of my childhood is that they are a little firmer than I remember.  They are not squishy like Jello or a gumdrop, they're quite a bit firmer, but not hard at all.<br /><br />When these are available -- grab them!  They aren't the easiest gummis to find, and they keep very well in the freezer.  I buy them in bulk and freeze.  Of course, you can take your chances, and wait for me to get there first.  (heh, heh)

review/summary: Another small sized treat
review/text: The individual packets are about one third ounce.  The packaging for the 16 ounce bag is a bit of a contradiction as, after packaging in small packets, it defines a serving size as four of the packets.  This is another good item to use as treats, either on occasions like Halloween, or just for everyday treats.  I do know some people who seem to be addicted to gummi bears.  It does have a "best by" date on the bag, many months out in the future, but it is unlikely they would last that long.  The small packets can be kept in a candy jar, dropped into lunch bags, etc.

review/text: These bears are hard to find.  They are the mini ones that my kids love to use for their ice cream toppings.  Individually packed.<br /><br />They are the best gummy bears that I know of.  No wonder they are the biggest gummy bear manufacturer in the world (based in Germany). It is not too sticky that it glues your teeth together. The gummies are not too sweet, just the right combination of flavors and taste.<br /><br />Just FYI: each serving has 140 calories, 10% carbo, 21g sugar, and 3g of protein. A serving is about 17 pieces of gummies.

I love this particular configuration of Haribo Gold Bears for the portion control it provides.  Each mini-bag contains 35 calories and there are six to eight mini bears per tiny bag.  Thus, this is the perfect size to pack in lunch bags, hide in purses, or sneak into the movies.  While gummy bears may not be the perfect health food, these mini baggies of YUMMY gold bears are a sensible sweet treat choice for the calorie-conscious.

review/text: This product just came out in my local grocery/health food store. I have bought the original Annie's Homegrown Gluten Free Mac&Cheese for my son who is Gluten intolerant. He has always enjoyed it and we as a family ate it as well. We would just add extra cheese to make it creamier but now we don't have to do that with this new product. It is very creamy and taste as close to regular Mac&Cheese that you can get from a box. It's also great because it contains almost twice as much as the other kind and since it's not a powder mix the ease allows a simple,quick dinner for my always,ever so demanding four-year old. So this gets a thumbs up from a spunky toddler. Also,we like to add things like left over taco meat or tuna to add varity to the dish. We love Annie's products!

review/text: This mac and cheese is creamier than the regular gf mac and cheese. And I LOVE more cheese! Make sure that you cook the noodles until soft and tender, or they will be very chewy. The cheese for this mac and cheese is an actual cheese sauce, not a powder. Which saves some time if you are short on it. Overall, very good, and I even hope Annie's comes out with an even cheesier mac and cheese! :)

review/text: I grew up on the blue box so if that is your taste standard look no further then this product.  Sure... if you're used to home made this probably won't compare but I actually like this BETTER then the original Kraft version as the noodles are a bit larger and stay firmer (took a few minutes longer to boil).  Growing up my mom never just served it "as is" but always doctored it up with extra grated cheddar cheese so I tried the same.  Even though the cheese comes in a foil squeeze pack I added a bit of milk and a Tbs of real butter then plenty of grated cheddar cheese - the results was awesome and I just make this instead of the Kraft brand for the whole family even though I'm the Celiac in the house.  It's so nice to stumble upon good GF substitutions and this is one I'll be using regularly.

review/summary: Finally, Mac and Cheese that reminds me of being a kid.
review/text: I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease at 17, and since then there are certain foods I have not been able to fully replace.  Mac and Cheese is one of them.  Before this, the closest I had come was making my own Velveeta Mac and Cheese, to imitate Kraft's version.  I have had the other Annie's gf mac and cheese, which is widely available in stores, but I've never been a fan of the sauce, which is made from a powder and just doesn't do it for me.  I saw that this deluxe version was available, but couldn't find it in any local store, so I took the risk and bought it here.  I am so glad that I did!  It tastes similar to the Kraft Dinner I used to eat as a kid, but I have a feeling that due to the better quality ingredients in this product I would still prefer Annie's to Kraft if I could eat both.  Now I have five more boxes stored in my cabinet and some left over mac and cheese in my fridge.  I think this will last me a while.

review/summary: Beware lactose intolerant individuals!
review/text: As a gluten intolerant person, I loved it when I found Annie's Macaroni and Cheese, which I always made with lactose-free milk because I'm also lactose intolerant. Found it creamy and yummy and healthier, but otherwise much like those other mac'n'cheese box dinners I ate as a child.  For some reason, the cheese in Angie's original gluten-intolerant Mac'n'cheese didn't bother me.  (Hard cheeses generally don't bother my lactose intolerance - always safe with parmesan, swiss, aged cheddar, but cream cheese, marscapone, brie, etc., are trouble).  Unfortunately, this creamy deluxe max dinner triggered my lactose intolerance.  Tried it twice, thinking the first time must have been a fluke, but it wasn't.  Something to think about if you are both gluten and lactose intolerance.  I'm back to Angie's original mac'n'cheese and not feeling like I'm missing out at all!

review/summary: Fast, easy, and a kid favorite!
review/text: This is a very delicious product!  It has the cheese mix already prepared in a foil packet, so there's no need to add any further ingredients (as opposed to the powder, butter, milk version).  I have to have this around the house because we often find ourselves in a situation without milk!  Also, in the powder version of GF mac and cheese, the noodles often break apart in trying to blend the powder/butter/milk, so with this pre-mixed variety, the noodles maintain most of their integrity through less stirring.<br /><br />I also find the flavor of the cheese sauce to be superior to the powder.  Don't add much salt to your water, though--it's already a bit saltier.<br /><br />The packaging looks very similar to the NON-GF version, so be careful which one you're purchasing!

review/summary: Feel like a kid again-eat your mac & cheese!
review/text: When I had to go gluten-free to achieve better health, I thought my days of mac and cheese were over forever.  Macaroni and cheese had been a family tradition my whole life (it was one of only three dishes that my grandmother would cook) and I hated the thought of abandoning it.  I decided to give this product a try, since I had eaten other Annie's products and enjoyed them in the past.  This packaged dinner has all the flavor of a home cooked dish without all the fuss.  Easy to prepare, easy to serve.  My husband had no idea he wasn't eating "regular" mac and cheese.  Thank you Annie's for letting me feel like a kid again!  If you enjoyed those "deluxe" mainstream wheat based products in the past, try this.

review/text: I was surprised, but I really liked this.  The noodles weren't gummy, the cheese sauce tasted like Kraft Dinner, and it was super easy.  I don't have to eat gluten free, my husband and son do, so I actually treat myself to real KD once in awhile and this really is just like it.  In the past, we were using DeBole's, and I always had to doctor it up with Horizon cheese slices and real shredded cheese.  And rinse the pasta off well.  And have butter and milk on hand.  Even with all that, I still couldn't stand the taste and wouldn't eat it.  This mac & cheese is good enough that I won't have to buy Kraft Dinner anymore and just enjoy this with my gf family members.

review/text: I've been gluten free for a few months now and I can honestly say that products like this one make the transition much easier.<br /><br />The noodles are great, provided you cook them long enough.  The cheese is very flavorful.  Many reviewers seem to think that means it's artificial, but if the packaging is to be believed, this is a completely natural product.  "Totally natural, gluten-free product, consists of no artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives, free of GMOs, trans fat, and cholesterol."<br /><br />Also, I've tried the regular mac and cheese from Annie's, it's not bad, but in terms of flavor, it doesn't come close.<br /><br />So for something that's affordable, tasty, and ready in less than 15 minutes, you can't go wrong.

review/summary: Can't tell it's gluten free!
review/text: I recently discovered I have a gluten intolerance and have been struggling to find foods that are quick and easy to make as well as gluten free.  I was cautiously optimistic when I ordered this product after reading other reviews here on Amazon.  When the macaroni and cheese arrived I couldn't wait to try it out.  My husband (who is not gluten intolerant) and I shared the box and we were pleasantly suprised at how delicious this macaroni and cheese was.  I've tried other gluten-free pasta products and have definitely noticed a distinct "rubbery" feeling to the pasta.  The macaroni noodles in this product did not seem rubbery at all and upon eating you could not tell that this macaroni and cheese was gluten free.  I liked this so much that I signed up for Amazon's Subscribe and Save!

review/text: Anyone who eats gluten free knows that it is VERY difficult to find a food product that tastes like the "real thing".  If you hadn't of told me that this was gluten free, I wouldn't be able to recognize it by taste alone.<br /><br />Yes it's more of an artificial cheese flavor, but what do people expect?  Fresh cheese isn't going to magically grow out of the box!  Compared to the other Annie's gluten free mac & cheese, this one is better (if not VERY close).  The reason why I like this better is because everything is in the box.  You don't need milk, butter, nothing.  Just boil the noodles, drain, add cheese sauce, and DONE.<br /><br />It's quick, easy, delicious and worth it!  Highly recommended!

review/text: As a new member of the GF community, I have been trying to find products that are not only GF but also delicious! Sometimes, this seems like a challenge. Because of all the other recommendations on here, I decided to try this mac and cheese. This mac and cheese is better than its Kraft and Velveeta counterparts in my opinion. The cheese is real and the noodles are great. I ate a noodle before I put the sauce on just to see what they taste like. You can't tell the difference between these noodles and regular ones.<br /><br />And today for lunch I reheated the leftovers from Monday (it is now Wednesday) and they are still delicious! That is the true test for mac and cheese.<br /><br />I will certainly be trying more of Annie's GF products.

review/summary: Tastes completely different than the 'regular' Annie's GF Mac and Cheese Dinner
review/text: I have subscribed to the original (not deluxe) Annie's Gluten Free Macaroni and Cheese dinner for over a year.  The sauce is light, creamy, 'customizable', and very tasty.  About a week ago, I decided to try out the deluxe macaroni and cheese dinner by Annie because the subscribe and save price was slightly cheaper and possessed roughly the same amount of product.  To be frank, the sauce is completely different.  I am not sure how the recipe for the cheese sauce can vary so much between these two products, but I definitely taste a significant difference.  The deluxe cheese sauce tastes overly artificial and more like cheese whiz compared to that of the original version.  Perhaps the variance can be attributed to the fact that the deluxe version's sauce comes pre-made in a packet, whereas the regular version's sauce may be customized to your individual taste by tinkering with the amounts of butter/margarine and milk.  Either way, I am going back over to the regular GF Annie's macaroni dinner (it earns a  five star rating in my opinion!).

review/text: Like the person in the other review, I just happened to pick out this water at Whole Foods one day when I was thirsty.  I was about to reach for my usual water, then suddenly decided to randomly try something different, since Whole Foods has soooo many choices!  Anyways, this was the winner, even though it was on the top shelf (and I'm only 5 feet tall).  It must've been my intuition or something because I fell in love with this water at first swallow!  The texture is so smooth and soft - it's like drinking liquid silk.  That's the best analogy I can come up with!  =D  Even my teenage daughter - who doesn't drink NEARLY enough water for her own good - tasted it and said, "Wow this makes ME want to drink water!"  And she really meant it b/c the next time I went to Whole Foods she asked if I would get her a bottle.  =D  It has such a clean taste, too.

review/text: I have never tasted water so good in my life.  I just happened to try a bottle I picked up at a Health Food store last week.  It tastes like it comes straight off a glacier.  I don't know how to describe it really, other than it reminds me of the flavor of tasting snow.  It is so fresh and clean tasting.  I only wish you could buy it in gallon jugs.  I have tasted plenty of fancy waters, and none of them really stood out far and above the average water, until I tried this.

review/summary: The best drinking water in the world
review/text: The purest and the most refreshing still water you will ever have. Do a blind taste test and you can tell the difference between Ice Age natural purest water containing only 4 dissolved solids parts per million compared to any other water in the market. So light, fluffy refreshing and smooth. Probably the purest all natural drinking water in the world!

review/summary: Doesn't last long for agressive chewers
review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/text: Our Siberian Husky is overweight and on a diet.  She also is great at building placque and tartar on her teeth - baad breath! She has a touchy stomach on top of it all.  Tried these bones in all flavors and she loves them.  They help with her teeth and breath.  She gets one bone for her lunch (she's a 3 meals a day gal).  Her other meals are now canned green beans with either yogurt (plain) or low fat cottage cheese.  She has lost about 11 lbs and is doing great!  No more throwing up her food!

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

review/text: My chihuahua loves these, especially the peanut butter, chicken, and bacon varities. They have become increasingly hard to find at pet stores so I was happy to find them on amazon. I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.

It's the closest that I can find to the dried on the cob popcorn and I love it. It is so fresh and natural tasting.  I've been using it for several months and ran out the other day and had to use a popular store brand.  Though the kernals popped up larger, the taste was stale and processed...not to mention, the India Tree popcorn is actually cheaper than the store brand.  I'm placing my order for more India Tree right now!
