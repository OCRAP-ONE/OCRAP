review/summary: My puppy loves her greenies!
review/text: My 8 pound puppy gets a greenie every day.  She's a pretty picky eater, and usually takes forever to finish a meal (there are lots of breaks in between bites).  But her greenie is the only thing she will eat without stopping.  She loves the taste.  They also seem to be easy to eat - soft and chewy - so if your dog has sensitive teeth, this might be a good treat to consider.<br /><br />On top of that, greenies are supposed to help with your dog's dental health, which is great for me, because brushing my dog's teeth is really difficult.

review/summary: Great way to try out Greenies!
review/text: This is the best way to buy Greenies for the first time! This way you can have your dog try them without spending alot of $.My dog is a very picky eater,so I ordered this mini-treat pak first.If your dog loves the Greenies,just hold onto the zip-lock pouch these come in and order a larger size the next time.Then just refill the pouch as needed! It's convenient and great to have when traveling with your dog!

review/summary: My chihuahua loves them!
review/text: My chihuahua Rocco loves Greenies.  He is a little over 5 lbs but can scarf one down in no time.  I was sceptical about it helping his teeth, especially since the recommendation is one daily.  I use them less frequently, however, I still have noticed a marked improvement in his teeth when I do use them consistently, a few times per week versus daily.  I consider them a special treat and my dog really enjoys them.  They cost $8.99 or more in the pet store, so $6.73 is a deal!

review/summary: Dogs cannot digest this, vet told me to stop
review/text: Our vet asked us to not give our dogs these because they cannot digest them. Whatever they are made of does not break down once eaten, made my dog sick and when I cleaned his potty I saw entire chunks on the treat. They claim the new formula is digestable, but it wasn't for our dog at least...

review/summary: I'm impressed
review/text: I admit it, I've been a bad momma and my 3 year old Yorkie's dental health could be better. After a recommendation from a friend, I went out and got a few of the individually packaged ones just to make sure because my pup is a bit of a snot about what she eats. Much to my surprise, she ran off with her Greenie and hid under the chair so the other dogs couldn't steal it from her! It wasn't until weeks later that I observed the ingredients list. Shock of all shocks, my little carnivore is totally into these and there isn't a HINT of any sort of meat in them. Other treats have been snubbed, biscuits go uneaten and the money we spent on treats is invariably NOT worth it. Greenies changed that completely!<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the steep price. I'm grateful to have such a little dog because I get more bang for my buck, but they're worth it. And it's probably much wiser to buy them here in bulk for a dog who's getting them daily. The vet also says these are pretty high in calories, but as our dog is 3 pounds and doesn't eat much anyway, I think these suit her well.

review/summary: My Dog's Favorite Treats!
review/text: This is my first review ever.....i had to write one......why? because GREENIES are THE best!!<br /><br />I have a 4 year old Shih Tzu, and like any other dog, he loves dog treats.  The problem is a lot of treats are bad for dogs, and they make him have diahrrea or he throws up.  Well Greenies don't do that to him!  I've given him at least 10 in the past 2 weeks, i give him basically one every other day as a special treat for being a good boy.  He's a good boy a lot! haha<br /><br />Anyway, when i pull out the bag of Greenies, he hears it, he sees it, and goes BONKERS when i open the bag because his keen nose can pick up the scent of what is about to be a delicious treat!<br /><br />If you aren't sure about what treat to buy your dog, look no further, this is THE treat to buy!

review/summary: What cherries?
review/text: I loved the cacao nib granola by 18 Rabbits. I also love cherries and vanilla, so I had high hopes for this stuff. Nope. I think there was maybe one teeny Bing cherry hiding in the first bag I opened. Then I looked into the other two bags for something cherrylike. Nope. Nothing. Very disappointed in that. The flavor is also rather bland, without a noticeable vanilla kick. Maybe it's a bum batch, but I'll not be purchasing this flavor again. I will stick with the fantastic Nature's Harvest granola varieties, also lower in calories and fat than many granola products out there and with a generous inclusion of fruit and nuts.

review/text: I love the 18 Rabbits Brand granola because it is the lowest carb granola I could find, is made with whole ingredients, has a nice texture, and great flavor.  This particular variety is not my favorite because the dried cherries are so hard that they are nearly impossible to chew. I highly recommend all of the other varieties of granola. My favorite is the Gracious granola <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DQYC">18 Rabbits Gracious Granola, Organic (pecan, almond and maple), 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> It is made in small batches here is San Francisco and is very expensive, it is nice to save a few buck on amazon subscribe and save.

review/text: The  aroma alone makes brewing this tea worth it. The aromas of the passion fruit and papaya are immediately noticeable when you take the tea bag out of the tin. The tea bags are stored inside foil to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I like my tea as is, so I never add milk, sugar, honey or anything like that. This is one of those teas that you can drink as is. When you brew it, the aroma of the black tea itself comes to the forefront, with subtle hints of the fruit aromas.<br /><br />The flavor of the tea is much less subdued  than I would have liked.  But, the fruity tastes comes out in the aftertaste. It is not very bitter, even if you overbrew it.<br /><br />I really enjoy having this black tea anytime of the day.

review/summary: Turned down by a turkey junky!
review/text: When you have a cat that craves turkey and basically, all types of poultry, it stands to reason that he should love this one, right?  Well, with a quick flip of the tail and a nose in the air, it quickly went down the garbage disposal after a long argument!  Good thing I only bought one!  Can't understand this at alll either - he loves the Friskies general brand of turkey, but hates it in Fancy Feast.  Same company, you'd think this one would be better, not so!  Anyway, try it for yourself particularly if you have a fussy cat because they're full of protein and vitamins.  One of the best cat foods out there (they put Iams to shame!) for that.  They're healthy foods, improve their energy and coats, and overall health. Just have to pick and choose though because they certainly can surprise you!

I found the website selling the 'original' world's largest gummy bear, and was ready to buy it until I figured I'd check amazon just in case, saved myself over $10 including shipping!<br />My family got it well on time, and even though they live in Texas, had no issues with smush face like some other customers have. They even sent a little finger puppet. My brother loved it, everyone was pleased, would definitely recommend it.

So, I decided to get her one for Christmas.  After reading the reviews, I was a little reluctant to spend $10 on something I thought would end up in the trash.  However, it was a big hit!  Does it taste like the small, high quality gummy bears? No, but, it did have a good texture and a decent taste.

review/text: First of all, I love this tea! It's better than any Ceylon tea I've had and is about the only tea I find comparable to a great Keemun. I have subscribed so that I won't run out.<br /><br />What I question is where it's from. Oothu is an estate (area) in southern India, not in/on Sri Lanka. This is supposed to be an Indian tea, not a Ceylon tea. Perhaps the seller is categorizing it as a Ceylon TYPE tea? Don't know. Oothu is a Fair Trade tea so it does make a difference.<br /><br />In any case, This is the third pound I've bought and I've NOT had any trouble with stale tea. The new bags from Davidson's are better at keeping tea than the old roll up type, but even then I had no complaints. I do keep tea in the kitchen in more or less air tight containers (mostly empty Tao of Tea containers) and the bulk amounts in the refrigerator.<br /><br />Given that different folks like different teas, here are my preferred teas, pretty much in order of preference:<br /><br />Keemun, Oothu, Assam and Yunan, Nilgiri -- all black teas.

review/summary: get cat food out of the grocery and gourmet food section
review/text: I am sick of searching for salmon and tuna and seeing friggin cat food. OK grocery stores do sell pet food, ok, I get it, but for sanity's sake make a section just for pet food that is separate from the human food. I'm aware times are tough, but come on! Granted, most of the typical store brands of tuna are not much fitter for human consumption than cat food, but I'm searching for the high end salmon and tuna, AMAZON! YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG, STOP!<br /><br />I've fed fancy feast to various pets over the years and it is very acceptable.

review/summary: Unsatisfied
review/text: I'm not sure if the product was kept on the shelf too long Or if it went through a drastic temperature change while in transportation. But there was something wrong with the product. My cat loves The flaked tuna feast from fancy feast but she did not eat 1 can from the package I ordered from you.  the expiration date was good, don't understand.  I ended up going to the local store and buying more of the same flavor.  I didn't return the case because i've already used some of it (assuming that my cat would eventually eat it).

review/summary: Great way to buy cat food
review/text: As I wrote in another review, I consider this the best way to buy canned cat food.  It is not my cat's regular fare, but more of a treat.  Trucking cans into the basket, unto the belt (check-out person is not happy to see me come with my 50+ cans when they are on sale), into the car and into the house gets old after a while.  I am happy and Jasmine (fifteen-year old black cat) feels safe with a steady supply.

Great flavor, very high nutritional value for my rescue cat, and the best part is that it doesn't stink up your kitchen!  The price is high here - about six bucks more than what I pay for these loaf packs in the grocery store.  Other than that, highly recommend!

review/text: My husband has egg allergies and I had been looking for scone recipes for our regular Sunday brunch. This is fabulous, and it is so easy to make - just add water! Lol! Love it! I have been buying dozens of boxes from Marshall's (Where they are only a third of the price btw) and stocking them for when guests arrive - I love to serve them warm from the oven with butter and lemon curd and some clotted cream.

review/text: This soda is the best there is out there! We were searching everywhere for it after tasting it at a favorite restaurant and found it here on Amazon for a great price. It does cost more than your colas but is worth it! Tastes like the old fashioned soft drinks instead of the artificial tasting carbonation that they are full of now. You can actually taste the flavor!

It is so delicious it is hard not to finish a bag in one sitting. We  were "counting the molecules" in the bag, which means it is so-oh good. Panda licorice is among the best, and now this Candy covered Licorice is even better.

review/summary: Great mix- fun to play with
review/text: I love this mix, and because it is plain it is fun to play with.  So far I've added chocolate chips to it; that was good, and chopped up dried apricots with about 1/4 cup of almond meal plus about one more TBS milk (delicious), and chopped dates and walnuts (wonderful- served them with honey), and a mix of dried berries (blueberries and strawberries)- marvelous.  All these iterations took at the most about 5 minutes to prepare :-)  I find I don't have to bake them quite as long as the package says- but I make small scones- and perhaps my oven is erratic.  At any rate, keep an eye on your first batch to get a good idea for baking time.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying savory additions next.  I'm sure they will be good too.<br /><br />This mix is fantastic alone, also- but it's so much fun to add things I find it hard to stop.  The mix is excellent quality, and I was very pleased to find the sell by date is a long way off (Nov 17 2011, for my two orders).<br /><br />I've ordered all the Garvey's mixes, since my family has so enjoyed this one and the coffee cake.  This is a truly exceptional company.  How lovely to have found them.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Have now made the fresh blueberry scones (as you see on the side of the package- it was great!  I topped it with some glaze and the blueberry sugar that Amazon sells.<br /><br />I also made a rosemary ham, shredded cheese and green onion scone (2 slices thing ham, minced, 1 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese, and one finely diced green onion)- these were really really good.<br /><br />And finely, I created a Parmesan, orange peel and white pepper scone that was the best of the lot.  I grated the peel off two organic blood oranges, added about 1/3 cup shaved parmesan, and 1/2 tsp white pepper.  The taste was absolutely out of this world.

review/summary: was skeptical, now a believer
review/text: I was very skeptical that this would taste as good as the other reviewers said, but it was on sale so I figured I'd give it a try.  My 5-yr-old son LOVES scones.  Well, not only does it taste great, but it's ridiculously easy to make and my son was able to help me.  In addition, my family comes from England so I've had my fair share of all sorts of scones.  I have to say these taste pretty authentic.  After they were done I wished I'd had clotted cream to go with.  And organic to boot, what a find!<br /><br />Also, being a mom who has to juggle, and never finding a recipe I didn't have to tweak, I found an even easier way to make them than the instructions on the box.  Using 2 boxes I dumped the mixes directly into a disposable foil 1/2 size lasagna pan.  Then I put in a full stick of butter that was room temp.  I forked it till the dough was little lumps.  I didn't add a flavor because I wanted to see what "original" was like.  (Great.)  Then I put in a cup of milk and forked it around till it was smooth dough.  There was still some dry mix at the bottom of the pan so I added the couple of tablespoons of milk.  Then, I got my hands in there and it wasn't too difficult to pick up the stray bits till the pan was clean and the dough was a ball.  Then I smoothed out the dough evenly in the pan.  Then I took a knife and scored it in quarters till I had 16 triangles.  Baked it and done.<br /><br />Mind you, I must say that my "easy" way of doing it is only if you don't mind not having the crusty edges on each triangle, the mark of a "real" scone I suppose.  To me, I'd rather save the time, the dishes, and it tastes the same, delicious!

review/summary: As good as everyone says!
review/text: Having just returned from our honeymoon in England, my new husband and I were bemoaning our fate: Chicago is a great food city, but not for cream tea. There simply isn't anyplace that we know of where one can get fresh scones with clotted cream. Out of curiosity I did a search on Amazon and stumbled across the many and emphatic recommendations for Garvey's Organic Scone Mix. I took the plunge and got my six boxes, and ... I couldn't be more delighted.<br /><br />Last night I surprised my husband with my first batch: the basic recipe plus raisins. It was too hot to turn on the oven, so I made half-size dough balls and baked them in the toaster oven for just ten minutes. They were so good! My husband couldn't decide whether they were tied with the best ones we had in England or whether they might actually be better. The crust was properly crisp and golden, and the inside was light and fluffy. I served them with raspberry jam and Devon cream (also bought from Amazon), and the only problem was that we ate the whole batch before I had a chance to take pictures. Thank you fellow Amazon reviewers for introducing me to my newest favorite baking mix; I can't wait to make another batch!

I can't think of an American made candy that compares.<br />You won't be buying these to hand out to trick-or-treaters, though. The price (in this country) is bank breakingly high.  If you have friends or relatives in England, you could ask them to send you some.  Or, as my wife and I agree, they make a wonderful additional motivation for our next trip to London.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: For years, we relied on Near East Rice Pilaf to brighten weekday dinners. The product cooks quickly and the pine nuts (not lentils, as another reviewer erroneously reported) are absolutely stupendous.<br /><br />Unfortunately, inflation has hit some of the higher-end grocery items, like this one, and at these levels (including the shipping), even a carton of 12 Near East Rice Pilaf boxes is way beyond our budget. Each box feeds about five people. For two, there will be leftovers. But still. Reheated rice and pine nuts, despite the interesting spice content, aren't as good.<br /><br />We've therefore shifted to a neat Trader Joe's combination of basmati and wild rices, with vegetable bits (not offered here) that spices up daily meals with a lot less strain on the purse. Amazon does offer a 12-pack carton of tasty-sounding 6.5 ounce <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JIJH2A">Basmati Rice</a> with roasted garlic and herbs but we haven't tried it, as even that is a bit too steep for us.<br /><br />We'll finish all the Near East products now on our shelves. But delicious or not, the stuff has just grown too dear.

review/summary: Not just a side -- Add stuff for a quick main dish!
review/text: While I still serve Near East rice pilafs as a side dish, I now fix them for a quick and healthy weeknight meal!  For most of them, I cook as directed in my small rice cooker (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XAG8W">Cuisinart CRC-400 4-Cup Rice Cooker</a>).  Five minutes after I hear the water starting its boil, I add a cup of cut-up cooked meat (leftover chicken, turkey, chickpeas, beans, whatever) and a cup or so of chopped veggies (fresh broccoli, carrots, onions, frozen peas).  When the rice cooker light tells me the rice is done, so is everything else!  (If you use a long-cooking whole grain pilaf, you will want to add these ingredients later in the rice-cooking cycle to avoid over cooking.)  I guess you could also mix the meat and veggies in after cooking them separately, if you prefer.  This is enough to serve three adults (unless they are really, really hungry.)<br /><br />You can find recipes at the Near East website for other ideas.

review/text: The beef jerky was pretty good, I really like the texture and the dryness of it.  I prefer a dry jerky that can be broken apart pretty easily and this was what I got from this jerky.  I had really hoped for more flavor from the meat, being grass fed and high quality, however, all I could taste was salt, and lots of it.  The jerky was extremely salty and that's pretty much all you could taste.<br />I think that perhaps next time I will order one of their other flavors and see if it fares better.<br /><br />Overall good jerky, just a little too salty for my taste.

review/summary: Based on beef being grass fed however . . .
review/text: the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately I'm unable to review the flavor as I forgot I can't have beef anymore (due to health issues).<br /><br />Ingredients:  beef, flavoring supplement (salt, dextrose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, spices, spice extractives, soybean oil), vinegar, brown sugar, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices<br /><br />Here is some info found on the internet:<br /><br />Maltodextrin ~ maltodextrin from corn or soy can be very unsafe/poison for anyone. As all GMO products like corn and soy are genetically engineered from the monsanto company. they insert a bacteria in all GMO products, and this changes the natural organic developing of corn or soy. do not buy anything that contains maltodextrin or titanium for your own health.<br /><br />Maltodextrin made in the US is made from corn.<br />Corn in the US is a GMO food so Maltodextrin as derived from a Gmo is extremely unsafe.<br /><br />Soy ~ this particular info from:<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />. . .fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits. Fermented soy does not wreak havoc on your body like unfermented soy products do.<br /><br />Here is just a sampling of the health effects that have been linked to unfermented soy consumption:<br /><br />*Breast cancer<br />*Brain damage<br />*Infant abnormalities<br />*Thyroid disorders<br />*Kidney stones<br />*Immune system impairment<br />*Severe, potentially fatal food allergies<br />*Impaired fertility<br />*Danger during pregnancy and nursing<br /><br />and for all ~<br /><br />Jesus Christ (Yahushua HaMashiach) is coming back. Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!

review/summary: I Can't Stop Eating These!... Right Out Of The Box!!!
review/text: Having gotten tired of the standard late-night snacks, (popcorn, chips, cookies, etc.) and wanting to watch the amount of fat & calories I take in late at night, I've discovered that cereals can be a very satisfying thing to munch on while sitting in front of the TV. (Also, due to a dairy allergy, I don't eat the traditional milk & cereal for breakfast anymore.) Every time there's a new cereal out that sounds yummy right out of the box, I have to give it a try and see how it holds up as a snack food. I've tried the whole new line of Chex cereals, and I gotta say this one is THE winner! (The Apple Cinnamon one is *way* too sweet- And, that's saying something for someone with a bottomless sweet-tooth. The Chocolate one is my back-up, although not terrific.) The Honey Nut Chex is definitely sweet but more subtle than many cereals. The classic crispy Chex texture is still there, making it a light-sweet-nutty-crunchy-yummy-in-your-mouth-sensation. Hmmm... Now I just have to watch getting that carb-buzz right before I go to bed. =P  (I ate about a quarter of a box while typing this. I'm tellin' ya... They're like Lay's potato chips... "You can't eat just one!")

review/summary: Tastes great, goes down BAD: BEWARE
review/text: I have not been diagnosed with Celiac Disease, I have a Wheat allergy, which means my reaction starts immediately after wheat hits my stomach. But my diet is still a Celiac diet anyways. I am also allergic to eggs and lactose intolerant. This Chex Honey Nut claims to have NONE of the above, so I was really excited to check it out!<br />It tasted great! I couldn't believe I was eating something Gluten-free, egg-free, milk-free with GREAT texture and taste. Remarkable. Until I started eating more. I usually eat very little cereal as a defense mechanism I learned as a child (milk + wheat = bad combination for me). Since I liked this cereal, I started eating more, like an actual human being.<br />Alas, my happiness was not meant to last. I started getting stomach aches, really bad ones, the type I get if I stuff my face FULL of WHOLE WHEAT. I can eat pizza till I faint and I still won't feel this bad. And bad, bad, headaches. I don't understand it at all. I know if I eat a lot of oatmeal (serving size) I feel sick also, but this doesn't compare. I don't know if it's the artificial coloring, flavors, oatmeal and traces of wheat, BHT or WHAT. It's just a bad combo. I've read from other people that all the other Chex Gluten-Free can have similar effects on some people. I also read Chex Gluten-Free tests POSITIVE FOR GLUTEN on the EZ Gluten Test Strip. Pretty bad for a cereal that claims to be gluten free. :/<br />I give it a star because even though it tastes great, I don't like to be blindsided by wheat. I rather eat a pizza.

review/text: I'm a cereal addict and tend to get really bored with what's out there and love when companies come out with new stuff. I never remembered liking any of Chex cereals, but I decided to give this cereal standard a try, totally at random. I couldn't believe my taste buds! These taste great, they are the perfect amount of sweet and sugary, with the nice crunch of the chex themselves. The honey glaze on the chex leaves behind a perfect "cereal milk" after all the chex are gone. I like to keep some in the milk and some outside the milk cause they are delicious both ways. I couldn't care less about gluten, but either way, if you haven't had this oldie but goodie in a while, give it another try! My new favorite cereal!

It's so crispy and perfectly sweetened. It stays crunchy for a decent amount of time, but you still have to eat quickly. The milk absorbs the honey, so you'll end up with a bowl of really sweet milk in the end. Hopefully Amazon adds this to their subscribe and save soon as I'd subscribe in a second.

review/text: We are a gluten free household and everyone, right down to our almost 2 year old enjoys Honey-nut Chex.  They are just sweet enough and stay crisp in milk.  The Amazon S&S price currently beats Walmart but as always that could change so do the math for yourself.

review/summary: Addictingly delicious
review/text: Oh man, Honey Nut Chex is absolutely delicious. It was actually a problem, since I became a little too addicted to that stuff, running through a box in 2-3 days, and I had to cut myself off! If you have more self control than I do, you need to try this cereal. It's got a good amount of sugar (9g per serving) but it doesn't feel overly sweet. This is highly recommended, and the price (11.5 USD when I bought it) is almost 50% cheaper than what I find at grocery stores.

review/summary: Great Cereal
review/text: Bought these for my son who is a very fussy eater.  He loves this cereal and after I tasted it, I love it too so we will be fighting over it.  Good thing it came in a pack of four.

review/summary: Subpar
review/text: I read all of the glowing reviews on here for this item and immediately purchased this gluten-free Honey Nut Chex cereal.  When I poured some in my bowl for the first time, what came out looked exactly like that cereal 'Life'.  The pieces were almost completely flat, which is very uncharacteristic of the other (amazingly delicious) gluten-free chex cereal flavors.  Perhaps I got a bad batch?  More importantly, the flavor of this cereal is bland at most.  I don't seek out outrageously sweet cereals or anything like that.  This was just 'blah' and completely caught me off-guard because I was expecting something epic based upon the glowing reviews.  When it comes down to it, there isn't anything wrong with Honey Nut Chex, per say... it is just nothing special.  I admittedly do feel badly for not giving gluten-free products full marks as I think I should be grateful that companies even make celiac-friendly foods.  The fact remains that as more and more genuinely delicious gluten-free foods appear on the market, it should be okay to admit which, among the many, stand out above the rest.  Honey Nut Chex does not.  The chocolate or cinnamon Chex flavors are FAR more appealing in my opinion.

review/summary: too sour
review/text: The puree tastes fine but it is TOO SOUR! My son can eat only 2-3 baby spoons of it. I wonder in what proportions they mixed the ingredients? It seems to me that 80% of the product is green apples. Disappointed:(
