Lucky for me, my dog was able to recover from the issues brought on by the jerky. Don't ever buy anything that you can ingest which is made in China.

It has great balance of the brown sugar, paprika, sea salt, chilli powder, black pepper, onion powder, and just enough of cayenne to add a little flavor. I have had so many of my friends ask me what do I use on my ribs, I give them the same ingrediants listed, but I don't have to do any of the mixing. Just make sure you "really" coat the ribs and let them marinate for a couple of hours. I do my ribs over night, and the taste is so good.I highly recommend this product. Oh, delivery is so fast and reliable.

review/summary: The BEST popcorn!
review/text: We tried to substitute a like product because we couldn't find the Mega brand when we ran out.  Big, big, big mistake.  We are literally throwing it away.  We were so disappointed in it (bland, cardboard like, low pop rate).<br /><br />We again found the Mega brand and the clouds parted, angels sang and we all snuggled in for a good movie and the best movie popcorn you can make at home.  We will NEVER try to save a buck again when it comes to popcorn.<br /><br />The taste and freshness are great.  Some in the family find it too salty, so we hold back some of the seasoning mixture.  It even reheats well the next day or two.

review/summary: Great Tasting Popcorn!!!
review/text: Purchased a 6oz home popcorn machine for the theater room and the hunt was on for a pre-packaged popcorn that would provide that "movie theater" taste.  The first popcorn we tried was Country Harvest and the family enjoyed that popcorn and we went through the 36-packages in relatively short order.  When it came time to order another box of pre-packaged corn, I went with Gold Medal's MegaPop based on the recommendation from a friend.  Gold Medal also makes a very nice, heavy-duty commercial use popcorn machine, and figured they would have a good tasting popcorn.<br /><br />The popcorn pre-packaged has two compartments; 1) oil; and 2) popcorn mixed with salt.<br /><br />Well, made the first batch of Mega Pop and my daughter was all excited when she tasted the popcorn, screaming it tastes just like the movie theater!!  Couldn't agree more!!  The taste was GREAT!!!  The majority of the popcorn popped no problem, with very few old maids.  If you want to control the amount of salt and want your popcorn to have a little less salty taste, (which is what I like) just shake the bag and don't use as much of the salt that pools at the bottom of the popcorn.  I have a feeling that this box isn't going to last long!!<br /><br />Now, my daughter has a sleep-over scheduled with six of her friends and wants me to make lots of this specific popcorn for her friends.

review/summary: LOVE this popcorn!
review/text: I love, love, love this popcorn!!  Got a 6oz popcorn machine and began by using my own oil, popcorn and salt.  It came out ok, but I never could get it to taste quite the same as movie theater popcorn.  Read reviews that this tasted like movie popcorn and thought I'd give it a try - they were right!  It tastes just like what you'd get at a theater!<br /><br />Everything, of course, is pre-packaged, so you just pour it in and pop away.  Couldn't be easier.  I do end up pouring the oil into a measuring cup first and then into my kettle, because it's a little awkward pouring it directly from the pouch to the kettle.  Some other reviews mentioned taking out some of the flavored salt, but I found the ratios between the oil, popcorn and salt to be spot on for my taste.<br /><br />The only negative I can see to this popcorn is the amount of calories.  Because they use coconut oil, the calorie count goes way up.  And while the package lists it as having "7 servings", I found that a pouch only feeds 2 to 3 hungry grownups.  It's definitely not a low calorie snack and it's not going to be something you'd want to eat every night....but it's definitely just right when treating yourself and your friends to a movie night!

review/summary: Amazing for the price and way better than great northern popcorn by far
review/text: I bought a package of this and a package of great northern popcorn. This is by far way better, and as close as I could find to being the best for the price. I used to buy mending shed popcorn packs, but they are too much. This is almost the same and way cheaper anyways. I have tried many different brands. Everything from Rico's to act II have been through my popper. This is so far the best value. It has good crunch and flavor. It is balanced. I recommend buying this over all of the other brands, but Orville Redenbacher's popcorn is what my tinsel town theater uses. For the topping or "butter' at home, I use orville redenbachers "popping and topping" pour over for the theater butter and this. It might be better than theirs actually. Everybody loves it, and always ask for it. I don't know what to do with this other great northern popcorn. It is just to chewy, husky, and has no flavor. I have never had popcorn that bad that didn't come from a microwave. I have had microwave popcorn better than that.

review/text: This popcorn is a little more expensive than GN but is worth every penny. I was given a couple of GN popcorn packets from my brother in-law to try. It was ok but tasted a little stale and there were a lot of unpopped kernels. I read the reviews for Gold Medal and decided to order a case. I am very glad I did. The popcorn was fresh,tasted like the movies and not a lot of unpopped kernels (don't get me wrong, there will be some upopped) but alot more popped than GN brand.

review/summary: Great tasting theater style popcorn
review/text: Short Notes (read below for full description): Great taste, pops about the same as a microwave bag, but only pops about 80% of the kernels.<br /><br />Full Notes: We have a 6oz kettle popper, so I wanted something that closely resembled movie theater popcorn.  This stuff is probably the closest I've found.  Honestly, it really tastes the same.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it leaves a lot of kernels unpopped.  When I dump the kettle, it's dry, and probably 1/5 of the kernels are not popped.  It seems like there isn't enough oil to pop them all.  I was going to experiment adding more oil, but I haven't yet.  I think this uses coconut oil, so I don't know how vegetable oil would work with it, plus I'm sure it will effect the flavor.<br /><br />As far as quantity, I think 1 package produces about the same as a standard microwave bag.  If I get get a higher pop rate, it would probably be more than a standard m/w bag.  I usually pop three microwave bags for four of us on movie night, and so far, I've only had to do two of the kettle ones to achieve similar results.

review/text: I tried a couple of other brands but this one far surpassed them all.  First of all, nearly all the kernels popped!  The taste is great, not too salty.  The salt is mixed with the kernels which makes it easier to determine how much to add.  My first batch was perfect, for me.  My wife prefers a little more salt so next time I'll let more of the salt from the bag into the mix.  The packaging is also much easier to handle than others I've tried.  This package is not too wide so it is easier to empty it into the kettle.  I will definitely order from Gold Medal again.  Thanks!

Two packages poped had enough kernels of unpoped popcorn left over to pop half of another package. I brought a new popcorn popper at the same time. I purchased this product. I don't think it is the new popcorn machine I purchased, it's this popcorn. Brought a 6 oz box of popcorn for my 8 oz popper, I used one package at a time. All of it should have popped. :-(

review/summary: Just like the movie theater pop corn
review/text: Great popcorn! However, you need to let it sit for a while after popping to dry out. Else, it's soggy.<br /><br />We use a Stir Crazy popper with a 8 qt lid. You'll need to order this from the manufacturer. This is the lid with straight sides as opposed to the rounded or dome shaped lid (6 qt) that comes with the popper. This size of package all pop and will fill the 8 qt with just a little extra. The lid will rise up 1". With the supplied lid, you can't get all of the kernels to pop before it overflows.<br /><br />I don't put all of the oil in the popper. I leave out about a thumbs (1" - 1.5") worth. Let the oil heat until it starts smoking. Add the pop corn and salt. Once it has popped, almost ALL of the kernels will pop, I transfer it into 2 large stainless steel mixing bowls. I put those in the oven at about 150 for 30 minutes. You wind up with very crunchy pop corn

review/summary: These are good.  Very, very good.
review/text: I don't mean "good for a gluten free cookie", or "almost like a normal cookie".  No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good.  No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells.  No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture.  They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free.  No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also.  According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well.<br /><br />That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff.  You're probably wondering what the catch is, right?  It definitely isn't the taste.  As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good.  I only see two drawbacks.<br />1) Cost.  Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected.<br />2) Quantity.  The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies.<br /><br />16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them.  However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us.  I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag.  Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating.  Even so, I still wish there were more in a package.<br /><br />One last note, just because I found it to be unusual.  Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight.  These aren't.  Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others.  There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space.  It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me.

review/text: I have been searching for a tasty gluten-free cookie cookie for several years, a taste that was equal to the cookies of regular eating days.  Lucy's Oatmeal Cookies ended the quest.  They are DELICIOUS!!! They are also a perfect size for a quick snack and ever so satisfying.  The calorie content is also good.  I am anxious to try other varieties.

review/text: These cookies are great, even greater since they have no gluten, no dairy, no eggs, and are light crispy and oh so good.  This is a phenomenal price too, and I love the small snack pack size!!!! Thanks Amazon.  And thanks Dr. Lucy (who lives one town over from me!)

review/summary: Good grief, these cookies are delicious!!!!
review/text: Are these really gluten free, because they sure don't taste like it!  There are a few other cookies being marketed as "gluten free" or "diet" but there simply is no comparison to these nuggets of goodness.  Frankly, even given the choice between these and something like a Pillsbury or Toll House oven-baked cookie, I'd take Lucy's cookies in a heartbeat.  No guilt, no high glycemic index to make you feel like you just gained five pounds, no impulse to hibernate.  Just moist, sweet morsels that make you wonder why the bag isn't three inches deeper.  (Seriously, Lucy, you need to make them deeper.)  And the inspiring story behind the creation of Lucy's cookies will make you feel that much better, knowing that you're supporting a homegrown business, rather than a huge multi-national.  I can't recommend these enough.

review/summary: Used to own stock in the company, but changed their formulation, and get a much lower rating
review/text: I used to love EVERY flavor of these cokies. I was the one buying out the entire shelf at WFoods. I started ordering on amazon multiple 8 packs at a time.  I could easily eat 2 boxes a day by myself!  I eat really healthy and my sweets is the only thing I give myself what I want.  I am vegan and "prefer" to eat gluten free, as I am supposed to due to healh issues, but don't always because there are no other GF desserts that are vegan that I LOVE.  So BOY was I disappointed when I had to stop buying them very mcuh because they changed the fat and calories significantly.  I wonder i anyone else noticed.  I wrote to Dr. Lucy and she replied.  I asked if I could still order some from her int he original formulation, or where I could buy them like that, but she said no.  The only reasons she gave were some type of problem with the formulation and baking f the cookie, but I don't understand beacause they were perfect??!  A better explanation would have been nice.  So thus, I am very disappointed in this line, which was the ONLY GF, VEGAN, LOW FAT/LOW CAL, DELICIOUS!!! line of desserts I enjoyed, and now cannot eat them very often at all.  When I am consuming large amounts, I'm sorry but 25g of fat for a whole box vs. 7.5 g fat/box for the old cookies?  Can't do it. Dang Lucy....I miss my sweet yumminess.

review/summary: Dry with after taste
review/text: I am in the health food industry and I am gluten intolerant.  I have tried many different GF cookies in the last ten years.  I bought a box of Lucy's chocolate chip cookies last night at Safeway.  I was not impressed.  The cookie was dry, almost to the point of being stale. This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.  I would suggest either Udi's frozen cookies or Glutino cookies.  I find these two brands superior to Lucy's.  Thanks for reading.

review/summary: Ecellent Vegan Gluten Free Cookies, No Tummy Aches
review/text: These cookies are very similar to garden variety wheat based chocolate chip cookies, they have similar texture and snap, but these are both vegan and gluten free, which matches my requirements.  My celiac disease makes me very sensitive to wheat and these cookies do not trigger any reaction.<br /><br />The cookies are if anything a little more crisp than most, but not at all hard or difficult to chew.  They certainly contain sugar.  I do not eat these everyday because they are so sweet, but I do like them and may very well subscribe to them.<br /><br />If I were rating these only on flavor and texture I'd give them 4 stars, but Lucy annoyed me by creating a bizzarre nutrition panel.  Each package contains 4 cookies.  They state it is 1.3 servings, then go on to say one serving has 130 calories.  So each package seems to contain 169 calories, possibly over some people's limit for a snack.  But let's be honest, these cookies with lots of organic cane sugar have a lot of calories.  Each cookie must weigh in at a bit over 40 calories.<br /><br />For years we have known that 42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.  Now we know it is a cookie worth of calories too, tasty calories.  Will buy again.

review/summary: nom, nom, nom!!! 4 stars from a  *non*-gluten free mom
review/text: While I am not gluten intolerant, I'm trying to reduce my gluten intake for health reasons and snacks seem to be the best way to to try and curb my intake. Since snacks of this type are not a dietary requirement (much as I'd wish they were) I have the ability to chose *any* cookie, gluten free or not, I am lucky in that I can afford to be a little picky. I had tried a few other weird/bland gluten free options and wow- these cookies really surprised me - the are actually very good! Crispy, no weird/off tastes, just like a "real" cookie. Nice size for dunking in a cold cup of lactose free milk without getting lost or soggy. I deducted one star because they could use a few more chips sprinkled in there.<br /><br />They are a little expensive but I don't mind the price point considering that the factory goes to great lengths to protect against cross contamination from allergens and gluten. Plus being a little pricey I am less likely to eat more than one pack at a time :) I'm looking forward to trying the four flavor combo pack next time.

review/summary: Delicious, but something is awry
review/text: These are very very good tasting. Crispy cookies, especially delicious when dipped in milk. They say gluten free, and I totally believe they are, because I did not have a wheat-type reaction. But, I have to say, I always feel MISERABLE after eating these cookies.<br />Someone else mentions how they are too sweet, etc etc. I don't think they taste too sweet, and they have 13g of sugar per serving which doesn't seem like it's that much, considering most other 'sweets' have more sugars per serving (take a look at Gatorade, for example).<br />That said, it does seem to be some kind of a reaction to the sugar, because immediately after eating them I feel like my body is dumping into some kind of sugar coma. I start to feel like lead, and lightheaded. They also mess up my tummy. Maybe it's the type of sugar they use? Evaporated cane juice is the 1st ingredient, and they also contain 2 kinds of cellulose, which I think are sugars also (but I could be wrong).<br />Anyhow, I gave 4 stars for taste, because they are THAT good, but keep in mind you may feel like you need a lengthy nap to recover from eating them.<br /><br />I agree with the previous poster they should do *something* about this ... I don't want stevia or artificial sweeteners in them, but maybe try using less sugar, or a different kind of sugar, like organic brown? I have no idea, but I would never let a kid eat more than 1 of these at a time, for fear it'd make them just pass out!<br />I eat other sweet stuff, and nothing makes me feel this bizarrely over-sugared.<br /><br />I'm not even totally sure it's the sugar that makes you feel this way ... any ideas? It's a shame, because they are so delicious. I've tried them several times, and may keep them on hand for a once-in-a-blue-moon craving, but I definitely won't be eating them often.

review/summary: Just like Snickerdoodles!
review/text: This cookies are really tasty and I will definitely be reordering.  I ordered the package of 16 small bags to be able to have a snack to carry with me to places unlikely to have anything gluten free, and I'm glad I ordered this product. If one is signed up for the autodelivery program the price is pretty reasonable. The little bag of 4 cookies helps me with portion control because if I had the whole box I would probably plow right through them.  They are very flavorful and taste just like cinnamony Snickerdoodles; there is no weird aftertaste as with many GF foods. (I have also had the oatmeal cookies and found them crispy too but much more bland; they would be good with coffee.) I've even considered crushing the cinnamon thins to make a crust for cheesecake but haven't tried that yet (would buy a box to do so to avoid the need to open multiple bags).  The cookies are very crispy, so if that is an issue for you, take note. (I know my false-toothed father would have to soak these in milk to be able to eat them, but I believe he would think they were worth it!)

review/text: I went on a search for dairy free chocolate and found these great cookies!  We believed my breastfed son was sensitive to milk, and having to avoid dairy when you're a chocoholic is very difficult!  These cookies helped to feed my chocolate cravings, and helped keep my sanity in those difficult first weeks with a newborn.  At first, I thought they tasted just a bit different.  They're a lot crunchier than regular chocolate chip cookies and they don't taste exactly the same.  However, after being off of dairy and munching on these cookies, I began to not notice a difference.  My picky husband also said they were good!

I didn't buy them because they were gluten-free, I just like anything that TASTES GOOD, whether it's low-fat, fattening, gluten-free, low carb, etc. and they ARE really good and surprisingly satisfying for being gluten-free.  Make sure that if you eat them while having coffee that you "dunk" quick (if you like to dunk your cookies).  I order 5 or 6 boxes at a time and will continue to in the future because now they are a favorite that I eat practically every day.

review/summary: Yummy, little crunchy cookies
review/text: If you have serious food allergies or gluten intolerance, you probably bake your own (and aren't reading this review) -- but what a joy to find Dr. Lucy's cookies in Starbucks recently!  Yes, these are boxed cookies, not to be confused with homemade, which is the sterling standard for me.  But given that, they're lovely!  The body of the cookie is slightly bean-flavored, since that's what the flour blend relies on; but it's not an obtrusive flavor.  Just a bit tangy.  The milk-free chips are great:  nicely rounded flavor, not burnt or sharp.  The texture is pleasantly crisp & sandy; not tough, not hard, not chewy.  Great with coffee or tea. Our favorite is the chocolate chip variety, but the cinnamon and sugar cookies versions are delicious also.  If you're not allergic yourself, but considering buying some for guests or grandchildren who are, then I'd encourage you to go for it.  You'll find you munch on them, too, because they're just yummy, little crunchy cookies.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: I discovered these at my local Starbucks and loved them. The sugar cookies are wonderful, have a nice crunch and leave no aftertaste. The easiest way for me to explain the taste of the sugar cookie is to tell you they taste & remind me of Christmas sugar cookies. The chocolate chip are good and the cinnamon are too but the sugar is my favorite. It's so hard to find gluten-free snacks that taste great and don't leave you yearning for a " real " snack. Buy them !

review/text: After being diagnosed as a celiac recently, finding products that are tasty and gluten-free really challenged me.  I traded off tasty for decent tasting after a while, but FINALLY I have found something that actually tastes good.  The crunchy texture makes me feel satisfied after finishing the bag.  These cookies are truly delicious and well worth the journey to find them.  Since God hasn't healed me yet, I am so thankful that He let me find these!

review/summary: Best Allergy Friendly Cookies I ever had.
review/text: I have 15 documented food allergies and it is very difficult to find decent goodies.  These are the best allergy friendly cookies I have tasted yet!  I tried them for the first time today.  I needed to use up a Starbucks gift certificate and found these cookies in a basket in the front of the store.  Boy was I pleased when I discovered they were as good as any cookie made with wheat and eggs. Not the bland, dry, grainy taste of most GF cookies. Also the price is much better than many of the other allergy friendly products I have tried.  You will not be disapointed in these.

review/text: I am not GF but my 7 year old daughter is and I like to try everything with her.  She almost did not get to eat any of them because they were soooo good!  I'm normally not a crispy cookie kind of girl, but the flavor of these cookies was better than even most nonGF cookies I've had.  We bought a small package from STARBUCKS and will definitely be purchasing many more from Whole Foods.

review/summary: Crispy Airy
review/text: These are fabulous! I saw in an online review of Dr. Lucy's cookies someone complaining about broken cookies when they arrived. Yes, some of the cookies will be broken, though not a lot. I think they break because of their unusual texture. I wish I knew the trick of making a cookie like this. They taste great, but a big part of what I just love about these cookies is their texture -- it's that airyness and crispness. Personally, they are addictive. I finished my first two boxes (I had bought, as a test, one of the 16 pack boxes in Cinnamon and one in Sugar) and sadly after a month or so I had eaten them all. I tried baking something simliar and couldn't do it -- though when I have mroe time, I'll give it many more tries. So just a couple days ago, I ordered a 16 pack box or cinnamon, sugar, and now I'm trying for the first time the oatmeal. I do recommend these cookies; they are my afternoon treat -- one pack of cookies (only 120 calories) and a good cup of decaf coffee and I'm fine till dinner!

review/text: These were wonderful. I don't know how they make these so crunchy and airy at the same time. I bought a 16 pack box of these and got in the habit of having a bag (only 120 calories for 4 good-sized cookies) of these every afternoon when I got sluggish. I began to look forward to their cinnamony taste and was bummed when I finally finished all of them. I tried to make some like them and it was a sad failure so just a couple of days ago, I ordered another box of these and the Sugar cookies (they are wonderful, too!) and I even ordered the Oatmeal ones so I can try those and see if they are as good as the others. I highly recommend these!

review/text: I absolutely love these cookies. I bought them when they orginally had a discount on them and at first bite I fell in love. Having Celiacs, it's really hard to find a good cookie but the oatmeal in these make them taste homemade. If the price was better, I would have give it 5 stars. Great for lunches or to send with kids when they can't have regular treats.

review/summary: Awesome Cookies and great package size!
review/text: My daughter tried these cookies at a celiac camp she was at and fell in love wih them.  In addition to her loving the cookies, what is great about them is their grab bag type.  Being gluten/dairy/perservative/dye free often she feels different (and a little embarrassed) with the types of foods she eats.  This size is like having something most of her peers eat but it's healthy.  Another benefit is her non-gluten sensitive brother also loves them.  That is the real test, if the gluten eating kids like it!

review/summary: I was pleasantly surprised at how good these cookies are
review/text: I have Celiac Disease and have tried several brands of gluten free "bought" cookies as I call them.  I have always been disappointed and resorted to baking my own.  Although baking my own is fine, sometimes I would like the convenience of being able to have cookies on hand when the urge strikes, or to grab when I'm on the go.  I ordered a "case" each of the oatmeal and the sugar cookies and was very pleased with both of them, although I slightly favored the oatmeal.  I purposely tried to detect the usual "off taste" that I've found in other cookies - there is no "off taste" to either of these flavors.  Both cookies are crisp, just the way I like them....I have just one word for them "yummy"!

I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00213IAUQ">Lucy's Cinnamon Thins, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a> but these are a close second.<br /><br />The cookies are crunchy, not chewy.  They do have a lot of sugar on the top but it is only noticeable if you have several at a time.  Seemed sweeter  to me than the cinnamon thins.<br /><br />Not crumbly or cakey.  No funky taste.<br /><br />Only 8 in the package, not very many at all.  Putting that in a positive light, you can consider it built-in portion control.  Handy if you're like me and sometimes happen to snack without actually paying attention to how much you are eating.

I have tried dozens and dozens of gluten free cookies.<br />A cookie-a-holic I have to have my morning coffee with a cookie.<br />Up until this point most of the gluten free cookies have been huge disappointments..<br />I have thrown more practically full boxes of cookies in the trash than I care to remember...they were just not worth the calories, they were that bad.<br />I do like Pamela's brand Biscotti cookies...but they are the only other cookie I've found good enough to spend the money on.<br />And lets face it prejudice abounds in the gluten free aisle...everything is outrageously expensive.<br />But these..they are lovely, crunchy, no grainy texture, no strange after taste, vegan, low calorie and low fat...actually a miracle of a cookie.<br />Most gluten free cookies are loaded with fat...and as I limit fat content that was another big draw back.<br />No problem here though, only 1.5-2 grams of fat per 4 cookie serving.<br />I have tried all 4 flavors and each is excellent, I don't think any would disappoint.

There are so many additives in today's food, that it is nice to know that there is a product that is completely natural.  You also have the feeling that you can trust this product, since you know that she created this for her own child. The calorie count is less than other cookies, and it also does nto affect diabetics as significantly as regular cookies do. I highly recommend this product, as well as her other cookies. While I do love chocolate chip, my absolute favorite would be the cinnamon.  Enjoy!!

review/text: I have a son who is allergic to milk, eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts; however, he can eat wheat.  We have tried lots of allergy-friendly products and are sometimes disappointed with the wheat-free ones as the texture and taste is often very different from products made with traditional ingredients.  That is not the case with these cookies.  They are by far the best allergy-friendly cookies that we have tried yet!  They have a nice, crisp (but not hard) cookie texture.  I was also impressed with the shelf-life on the cookies that we tried.  Many allergy-friendly cookies have a very short shelf-life, but the Lucy's cookies that we tried today didn't expire until October.  Way to go Dr. Lucy on creating an excellent allergy-friendly product!

I find myself purchasing some just when i get a cookie craving.  they are hands down the best line of cookies I have ever had....Great flavor (you would NEVER know that these were produced with safe products rather than traditional cookie ingredients).  I think one of the hardest thing for parents and relatives and friends of people with allergies is finding GOOD, tasty foods...especially sweets.

review/summary: Awful
review/text: As a mom with Celiac disease with one son that has a tree nut allergy and another that has a soy allergy, I really wanted to like these cookies.  We are used to cooking everything from scratch to ensure the safety of our food.  Wouldn't it be great to have a cookie that my tree nut allergic son and I could grab on the go?  I paid a visit to my local Starbucks to pick up a 1.25 oz. pack of the sugar cookies and excitedly opened the package.  The smell alone was enough to immediately turn me off.  The bag had a synthetic odd smell inside.  I took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness-a good thing about the cookie- but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste.  It almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor. A very odd and unpalatable taste indeed. I was so disappointed.  I really liked the story of Dr. Lucy and the idea of the cookie, but most definitely did NOT like the cookie. Although I would classify myself as a bit of a food snob with high standards, I put that aside when reviewing this cookie.  I do not think even the less discerning customer would enjoy this cookie.

They also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package.<br /><br />There is nothing special about these and are not worth the price, although I love the packaging.<br /><br />Sorry Lucy I've tasted way better GF cookies.

review/text: I am a big fan of coconut water, but disliked lugging home all those individual servings.  Plus I found that some brands had too little flavor for my taste.  With CocoHydro's powdered formula, not only do I have several weeks' worth of drink, I can adjust the amount of flavor for whomever is having a glass.  Plus, I LOVE the idea that, coming from Indonesia, the powdered formula produces a much smaller footprint than shipping containers full of liquid.  I originally bought the plain, unflavored variety, but this has just a hint of additional flavor and is extremely refreshing.  I'm hooked!

Alas, solution presented itself; thank you Big Tree boys - you rock.  I can't say enough about my appreciation for the convenience and cost-effectiveness of getting my daily dose.  Ease of imbibement at any time as I keep a pouch in my backpack is awesome.  I'm very glad I was able to also try pineapple as admittedly I'm not as super hot about this flavor.  Although maybe somewhat sacrilegious I found I like this one mixed with sparkling water and a squeeze of lime, that's dee-lish and oh so refreshing.

I'd have preferred to try the unflavored plain one out first, but this was the only flavor they had.<br /><br />I'll start with the pros.<br /><br />1. It's cheap.<br />2. It's a better option than most packaged drinks.<br />3. There is a minimum of crap in it, as far as I can tell.<br />4. It has a low carbon footprint relative to other coconut waters.<br /><br />Now for the cons.<br /><br />1. It does not taste anything remotely like coconut water.  I would say it maybe has a slight bubble gum flavor to it, but not really.<br />2. Neon/florescent pink color.  It looks like I imagine a pink lemonade made by Crystal Lite to be.  Lose the color!<br />3. Not refreshing at all.<br />4. The zippy top on this package is a bit of a PITA.<br /><br />I would like to try the plain one before writing this product off entirely.  I really like what Big Tree Farms does, but until they make this a better product, I recommend staying away from this one.

review/summary: cocohydro pomegranate raspberry
review/text: My review on cocohydro pomegranate raspberry  is just an OK I did not like the flavor as much as the pineapple flavor, but mix them both and it is not to bad. I will not order this flavor again, we prefer the pineapple flavor. On the plus side I like this one as there is low sugar and carbs.

review/summary: Excellent, particularly for training
review/text: I know that this doesn't really taste like the 'fresh' coconut water. It seems unfair to think that anything powdered would ever taste like the fresh stuff. That being said, this makes training with coconut water fairly affordable. There is no WAY that many people could afford to drink fresh for an entire season of training for triathlons or marathons.<br /><br />The taste is pleasant and neutral. I have never gotten any upset stomach or other ill effects. Gatorade and other sports drinks have always made me nauseous, so this is a pleasant alternative.<br /><br />Would highly recommend!

review/summary: Not as satisfying as the candy
review/text: We are big Zours Candy fans, so we were excited to find Zours Gum. Strictly as a gum, it is acceptable. However, if you are expecting that great Zours flavor, you will be disappointed, as were we.

review/summary: Pretty blah
review/text: Bacon pop doesn't really taste much like bacon at all, as the previous review mentioned. It seems like VERY lightly buttered popcorn, with a very light sprinkling of Bacon Salt. In fact, sprinkling it with some more Bacon Salt, or even just sea salt, does improve the taste. What it doesn't improve is the fact that it makes the whole house smell like a mixture of burnt popcorn, and something else unpleasant that I can't quite place.<br /><br />I'll stick to regular buttered popcorn sprinkled with Bacon Salt next time. Cheaper, tastier, and doesn't always smell burnt.

review/summary: "Bacon" Pop
review/text: I love bacon. I love the whole bacon experience, and I'm not ashamed to say it. I actually saw this product on another website and was just so curious that I had to shell out the money to buy it. I'm actually eating the popcorn as I type this and...well, it's tasty, but it doesn't really taste like bacon.<br /><br />I was expecting this to fill my kitchen with the smell of cooking bacon while it rotated in the microwave, and it didn't. The smell was just sort of...weird. The taste itself is interesting, and certainly smoky, but if I didn't know this was supposed to be bacon I wouldn't be able to tell while eating it. It tastes almost like butter with smoked salt or something.<br /><br />If you like popcorn, by all means try this, but don't expect to knock you over with the taste of real bacon. I guess it's vegan/vegetarian for a reason, hm?

review/summary: Bland taste, little bacon flavor
review/text: when you open the package, it smells like bacon.  After poping, the smell is a heavy burnt bacon smell.  It doesn't really taste like bacon...occasionally you get a piece that tastes like bacon, but overall the popcorn is just plain.  We tried 2 bags to be sure we didn't get a bad pack...same result.<br /><br />This is great for novelty and themed gifts.  But if you are looking to satisfy a bacon craving, this isn't for you.
