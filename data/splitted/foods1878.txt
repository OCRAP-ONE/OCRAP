review/summary: Really, just incredible granola.
review/text: Fantastic flavor -- it's sweet, but there's this deliciously nutty aftertaste that hits you as you keep chewing, probably due to the flax and sesame seeds. Healthy too.<br /><br />It's under $4 per bag if you buy from Amazon and around $3 per bag if you get a subscription, which is something like half the price of what it is in stores.

review/summary: Cereal?
review/text: It is sweet to me, but I am used to a food without sugar. My question - is this actually cereal, trail mix, or just random things in a bag you can do what you want with? It is soft as-is and I am not sure what milk soaked in, if any.<br />Words to describe: delicious, giant nuts, not hard, 6 grams of sugar per 1/4 cup, no aftertaste, and cereal??.

review/summary: get naked!!
review/text: I travel a lot and am always on the lookout for healthy snacks I can take along with me.  This granola is exactly what I like.  It's tasty, healthy, and the packaging it easy to carry.  It comes in a ziplock bag, so it stays fresh.  Love all the varieties of it but this is my favorite.  It's great for breakfast, but also good just right out of the bag, any time of day.  Very quick and filling, which is perhaps the best part for me.

review/text: This is the best granola cereal that I have ever tried.  I first found it at Sam's Club in 20 oz. bags but they do not stock my local store any longer.  Many may think this is pricey but well worth it.  Now I routinely schedule this for delivery and get a little more discount.  I mix it with a pumpkin seed flax cereal and eat it with blueberries and banana.  Wow!  Its nice to look forward to when you wake up.  Buy it!  You will not be sorry.

review/summary: unethical and misleading labeling...
review/text: Amazon doesn't allow zero star reviews...and the one star I had to allow is far too generous.  This product deserves about a negative 10 star designation.  It is not organic (one reviewer described finding it in the "organic" section of their local grocery store).  The label on the bag claims "100% pure & natural granola" (this claim is meaningless) and on the back has the following:<br />"No artificial flavors; No cholesterol; No hydrogenated oils; No high fructose corn syrup; No artificial preservatives; 0 g trans fat"<br /><br />Notice it does NOT claim to be GMO-free and the likelihood is that this granola DOES contain GMOs, as it has non-organic canola oil.  Please be aware that "Bear Naked" is not some folksy brand - it is a subsidiary of Kelloggs...the same Kelloggs that has donated substantial amounts of money to defeat a California November 6th Right-to-Know Ballot Initiative (Proposition 37) that would require mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods and would, in the words of the Organic Consumers Organization put "an end to the unethical practice, unfortunately common even in the alternative food sector, of marketing or labeling GMO-tainted food as "natural."<br /><br />The group GMO Free USA, has launched campaign #1: Boycott Kelloggs, noting "In this digital age, you have to wonder why a company would spend more money than it could possibly cost to change their product labels to fight against the consumer's right to know what we are eating."<br /><br />Why, they might even have to label a seemingly "clean" brand like Bear Naked with the truth...and then how much of this phony product would they sell? Don't be fooled...I certainly won't be buying from Bear Naked again...or any Kelloggs products.

review/text: Bear Naked Granola Fruit and Nut is our very favorite granola, but my order on 1/5/07 arrived, and the batch I ordered did not seem as fresh as the others I have ordered.  Specifically, the raisins in each bag were so hard we had to spit them out. So hard you could not chew them.<br /><br />The other six bags I ordered on 1/5/07 were a gift.  I sure hope the batch the recipient received was not that stale.<br /><br />Our previous orders of this same product proved to be just great!

review/summary: Super! But nutritional information is devious.
review/text: This is my favorite granola. Great taste, chewy, generous with nuts, natural ingredients, and the company has a wholesome and green attitude. Super! There is one significant caveat . . . they are very devious with the nutritional information, so beware!  The "serving size" is listed as 1/4 cup, enough to feed a small bird. I always mix this with Post Shredded Wheat/Wheat'n Bran (and use soy milk), probably the most nutritious and honest cereal out there. Perhaps the only cereal with no sugar or sweeteners (or salt). Tasty and plenty of fiber, too. And reasonably priced. If you are concerned with healthy eating, don't pass Post Shredded Wheat, Wheat n'Bran by. It has a nice crunch and taste, though mixing it with Bear Naked Fruit and Nut makes for a more roundly delicious meal. The Post Shredded Wheat/Wheat'n Bran lists a serving as 1 1/4 cups. Realistic. Compare that to Bear Naked's 1/4 cup and you will see that Bear Naked, despite its great taste, is extremely caloric. 1 1/4 cups of Bear Naked has 35g of fat, or 55% of the Daily Value and 700 calories! 1 1/4 cups of the Post cereal has 2% of the Daily Value and 200 calories. So for taste and enjoyment I would give Bear Naked five stars, but for the dishonest nutritional information, I lower that to 3.

Then my stomach started to cramp. I stopped eating and checked the label -- sure enough, near the bottom, 'ground flax seed'.  My husband, who is not much of a granola eater, tried some a few days later, and although he isn't allergic to flax, he found it still made his mouth and throat itch. If you're not allergic to flax, by all means enjoy it, but if you are -- DON'T TOUCH IT!

review/text: These are the first snacks and finger foods I ever gave to my daughter. I was so scared of her choking on anything that I thought I would wait till she's 1 or longer... and then I came across HappyMelts Yogurt Melts and I totally felt in love with them. They melt in her mouth quickly and they are delicious. I've tried all 3 of them: Mixed Berry, Strawberry and Banana and I have to tell you they are all different.<br />Mixed Berry - purple, very flat oval shaped, very easy and quick melts, very sweet<br />Strawberry - pink, very hard acorn shaped (like little Hershey kisses), chunkier and melts not as quick, not as sweet<br />Banana- yellow, softer acorn shaped (like little Hershey kisses), chunky but they melt quickly<br />I thought there was something wrong with all strawberry ones, as they seem to be really hard, but I guess that's the way they are. Mixed Berry is my baby's favorite and I love them too :)

My eight month old son immensely enjoyed them, and I looked at the ingredients and was really surprised to find sugar listed second, right after the cultured milk. It is organic sugar yes, but still added sugar- and I'm bummed as this was not something that I wanted to introduce to his diet yet. My fault that I was swayed by advertising, and didn't read the back.

review/text: I have 2 boys, 5 and 8 and they love Happy Melts! They have been on a kick with Banana Mango but love all the flavors. My 5 year old was asked to bring the snack to school last week and we brought these to share. All 13 of the kids in the class loved them and asked for seconds. My 8 year old is an extremely picky eater and he loves these as well.<br />  My favorite thing about them is that they contain probiotics (helps maintain a healthy balance of good bacteria in the intestines and boost your immune system) and prebiotics (which keeps the good bacteria healthy). I have checked other brands and Happy Melts is the only product to have both of these. I also love that it comes in BPA packaging and does not contain anything artificial. I wish I could give this product 10 stars!!!

review/summary: Sugary, but delicious!
review/text: I wouldn't suggest feeding your little one a million of these a day, as they are high in sugar, but they sure are delicious!  He loves them (and so do I)!  They melt almost immediately, so they are a great first finger food.

review/summary: Tastes a lot better than Gerber
review/text: I would definitely recommend these. They taste a lot better than Gerber yogurt melts, and they are better for you. Even my husband likes them and will snack on them, which is saying something because usually anytime I have him taste our daughter's snacks, he makes a horrible face and asks how in the world she can eat it. Not the case with these. And my daughter (now 17 months) likes them, too!

review/summary: So much better than the 'mainstream' brand!
review/text: I've been feeding these to my 10 month old as "dessert" for the past month or so, and he loves them.  I like them too, and have been known to pop one in my mouth when I'm putting them on his tray.  We were out the other day, and our local grocery store doesn't carry happy bellies, so I picked up a bag of Gerber melts.  How different could they really be?  As it turns out, very.  Baby ate the Gerber ones okay...but I tried one and almost spit it out.  It tasted like cardboard. These ones actually taste like strawberry yogurt.  You can't go wrong!

review/summary: My daughter loves these
review/text: My daughter loves these yogurt melts.  Banana and Mango are two of her favorite flavors.  The melts themselves are a smaller size than the Gerber melts, which is nice for younger babies.  I was always breaking the Gerber melts into 3 or 4 pieces, which got a little messy.  I don't have to do that with these melts.  These are tasty AND organic.  We've had a lot of success with all of the Happy Baby products we've tried.  Highly recommend.

review/text: These are the first finger snacks I gave my 8-month old, whom was already on solids at 5 months though. I found them originally at my local Target. He absolutely loves them.  They melt in your mouth.  I've had nieces and nephews that love to snack on these too whenever they come to our house.  They range from 3 to 8 years old.  I like how it's just organic yogurt, and how they're perfect for little fingers.  I only wished that they'd sell these in a variety pack for all the flavors.  The banana mango is my son's favorite.

review/summary: My daughter loves these
review/text: My 11 month old loves these melts - she's been eating them since she was about 7 months old.  The only problem - not really a problem just an observation - is that once her fingers get wet the melts tend to stick to them and she has some difficulty getting them from her fingers to her mouth - she generally ends up with several stuck to her head and behind her ears (not unlike the rest of her food I suppose).  She also likes the berry flavors - I think they're pretty tasty too but all the other adults who've taste-tested found them foul.  Oh well.

review/text: Would you believe that my daughter doesn't like yogurt?! Odd b/c I thought every child loved yogurt... these are the answer for my yogurt-avoiding-14-month-old! She thinks these are candy and pops them in her mouth one after the other. I have to admit that sometimes I enjoy a few myself! Price is good at a couple of bucks per bag. I mix these with her cheerios and it makes a delicious snack. I too tried the Gerber brand b/c they were on sale at our local supermarket but they were not such a hit. Strange b/c to me, they taste about the same... go figure!

Have not tried the other flavors yet but plan to get them.  Wish they would sell a varity pack instead of having to buy 8 of one flavor.

Not a lot for the price, but this is the same buying elsewhere.<br /><br />Overall the cons aren't really cons, just wanted to make sure parents that haven't tried these were aware.  Buy these regularly, so not really negatives.

review/summary: Toddler loves them, but they are gone too soon for the cost
review/text: My son loves these things, but they go too fast. He pretty much eats half a bag at a time - and that ends up being quite expensive. I stopped buying them because of this. However, I would definitely consider getting them again for a roadtrip because they are dry, portable, and not messy even if dropped on the floor or seat. But for snacks at home, they are not worth the money.

review/summary: A Little Scary How Much The Kid Loves These
review/text: I am a first time mom, and our child had A LOT Of difficulties with solid foods and had an overactive gag reflex.  This food (and we do buy these in the set of 8)was and continues to be a lifesaver.  When nothing else would do, our baby LOVED these. I will say that they are on the expensive side compared to what you can get in the grocery stores and "big-baby-chain" stores.  We compared these to the GERBER yougurt melts and I believe there to be a noticible difference in quality/ taste, with these coming out on top. In the begining when she was just starting solids she would eat bunches of these on her own. They melt very quickly and for us, there was never a concern for choking (or puking with the overactive gag reflex).  Our baby is older now and can eat a lot more table foods, but we still mix these in with other puffs, cherrios, and small cereals for her to eat as a mix.<br /><br />I have purchased three orders of these from amazon (and enjoy amazon prime shipping)- so will likely purchase again, would recommend to a friend, and would buy (in smaller portions) as a gift for other moms to try out.

review/text: We have been buying these melts for about 7-8 months now for our daughter. They do tend to go fast, and since they are pricey we buy them sparingly and give them to her as a special treat. No funky ingredients in these that you cannot pronounce. I love how you know exactly what you are giving your child with these (and bonus, NO artificial colors/dyes!). I definitely recommend them as an addition to your diaper bag essentials. They keep my daughter busy when she is getting antsy while out running errands. Overall a great snack to have on hand for your little one(s)!

review/summary: My son's favorite snack!
review/text: These are my 2-year-old son's favorite snacks of all time. Having tasted them myself, I can see why! I like to make a toddler "trail mix" with them, using pretzels, puffs, etc; but he typically picks the yogurt melts out of the mix, eats them, and then asks for more melts, ignoring the other stuff. It's nice to have a snack option that offers the nutrition of yogurt without having the mess of regular yogurt, or the need for refrigeration. We don't do a ton of dairy in our household, so I like that, in addition to being delicious, this snack is a good calcium source.<br /><br />These are nice for younger babies too because, as the name implies, they melt in the mouth. I know there are other companies out there that make yogurt snacks, but I like that these are 100% organic, preservative-free, and have pre- and probiotics. Highly recommend.

review/text: They're a lot tinier than the Gerber ones, but they're also "healthier". My son loves both, and I'm happy I found them for a relatively good price (do subscribe and save if possible!).

review/summary: The come back kid snack...
review/text: I first offered these to my little guy at about 6mos. He enjoyed them, but wasn't crazy for them.<br /><br />Off and on over the last seven months, he'd pull the bag from his snack shelf and ask for them. Sometimes a week or two would go by with no request. Other times he'd want to snack on them all day.<br /><br />I think they're tasty too.<br /><br />My little guy is a yogurt fan beyond this treat, but it's handy to have in your on-the-go stash.

review/summary: I don't even have a baby!
review/text: I really like these. They melt in your mouth like astronaut ice cream and bring back fond memories of my childhood. Plus they're all organic and the entire bag only has 120 calories so you don't have to feel too bad about eating them all. The strawberry is definitely the best flavor. I've had the other two and they're okay but I don't think they're worth the high price.<br />I know Gerber makes their own version of these that I have seen at Safeway for only $3 each but I think they aren't organic. The only reason I would buy the Gerber ones is that they have strawberry, wildberry and peach flavors instead of strawberry, wildberry, and some sort of banana mango flavor. I don't remember exactly what the yellow flavor is...only that I disliked it.<br />AMMENDMENT TO REVIEW: The Gerber version is nowhere near as tasty as these ones. They are larger and chalkier and taste more artificial. If you are going to buy them online anyway, go for the good stuff.

review/text: My daughter was 12 months old before we gave her any food out of a package, everything up until that point was home cooked vegetables, fruit and grains.  From what I can tell, these are a "healthy" snack that she really enjoys.  They do taste delicious and are easy to take on the go.  Right now they are very helpful because chewing is uncomfortable with all her new molars; these melt in her mouth and satisfy her.  We will definitely buy more of these!

review/text: I like these yogurt melts as a healthier alternative to those available in my grocery store, but I wish the sizes were a little more predictable. Some of the melts are tiny, while some are nearly an inch in diameter!

I don't know what is creating that odor and taste since these are not expired. I will not order these again. I don't know how some of the adult reviewers who are eating these can stand them. We buy happy baby greens puffs and love them. I have bought other happy baby items and thought they were great. These are a miss.

I wish the company could come up with some kind of quality control.  The Gerber yogurt melts are very consistent but I prefer these because they have more vitamins than Gerber.

review/summary: My 9 month old daughter threw these up!
review/text: These should have an age limit. I do not think that breast fed babies under one should be allowed to eat these. Babies do not need probiotics at such a young age. My daughter ate about 5 of these and a couple of hours later projectile vomited all over the place! She does not spit up ever. I wished that I would have bought just one bag of these before I bought a whole lot of them!<br /><br />I think she will like them when she is a little older and used to eating other foods. She is mostly breast fed and eats some solids.

review/summary: Fantastic products.....
review/text: Honest I am not Patrick. I am Patrick's wife :)<br />On with the review.....<br /><br />The yellow is probably the best tasting to me. My kids like it too followed by the pink and then the purple varieties. Each can contains 2 servings. The product uses melatonin and Valerian as it's "relaxation" ingredients. Other ingredients include sugar, b vitamins, rose hips, acai berry and natural flavors.<br /><br />I split a can between my 4 kids when we are transitioning from a "break" schedule back to a "school" schedule. We are all night owls and early mornings can be rough for us. So when I need to get them back into a schedule we rely on this stuff. Within a half hour or so they are in their beds asleep. I of course tried it for myself and it really does calm the body down making it easier to fall asleep. I highly recommend this product if you can find it. I can't say much about the price since it varies from each vendor. I find mine locally at the gas station here. You may go to  their site and see if it has places you can purchase in your town/city.

review/summary: Delicious, nutritious & handy!
review/text: These Kellogg's Raisin Bran Crunch cereal cups are so convenient.  Great for travel,or in a hurry up morning where time is short, and the cereal is delicious, comes in a good sized serving cup and the cereal is good for you too!  I used to buy these in the 60 cup pack that contained just the Kellogg's Raisin Bran Crisp, but these are no longer available.  The only way to get them now is in the 6 pack carton.  Just the same, I'm glad at least this size is still available.  Just pour milk right into the container and enjoy. We take these on travel all time.  They are handy to send for school breakfasts too; sometimes the breakfasts offered at school aren't all that appetizing and the selection is minimal.  After our nephew would weigh-in for wrestling, he'd eat the contents of two cereal cups before the start of his daily classes .  The other guys, on the team, all wanted to know where he got them.  He just told them his aunt always had them for him and didn't know where I had purchased them.

review/text: It says clearly on the front of the box - gluten free, wheat free, dairy free, casein free, peanut free, tree nut free, corn free, sugar free, egg free, soy free & potato free!  It is really difficult to find gluten-free baking items that are potato-free! But this is one!  Of the 123 gluten-free mixes, this one and the cornbread mix are potato free!  This mix makes two 8" round cakes or 24 muffins or one 13x9 inch cake.<br /><br />I made sugar-free (maple syrup) cupcakes and didn't ice them and they taste decadent!  Very devil's food dark chocolatey and sweet enough but not like junk food.  If you wanted something sweeter, the frosting would put it over the top!  The cake is moist and fluffy and would fool glutenous eaters!  This is my favorite gf potato-free chocolate cake mix.  My local Whole Foods carries it and sells for $6.99 each.  Other favorites are Authentic Foods brownie mix and Cravings Place Double Chocolate Chocolate Chunk muffin mix.<br /><br />On the back are clear instruction to add light brown sugar, sugar, butter, eggs & buttermilk OR two alternative recipes of how to make this cake sugar fee and how to make this cake non-dairy!<br /><br />The INSIDE of the box has instructions for making the following versions:<br /><br />Sugar-free Devil's Food Chocolate Cake<br />Egg-free Devil's Food Chocolate Cake<br />Chocolate gingerbread Cake with White Chocolate Glaze<br />milk Chocolate Cake<br />Chocolate Cranberry Cake with Cranberry compote and Chocolate Frosting<br /><br />from mfg's website:<br />Gluten free, Wheat free, Soy Free, Corn free, Casein free, Dairy free, Potato Free. A deep, dark rich chocolate cake - this is wonderful for birthday cakes or any special occasion. You can serve this to your gluten-eating friends and they'll never know it's gluten free! You add your own sweetener. Each package makes one 9x13 or two 9" round or 24 cupcakes. Ingredients: Cocoa Powder, Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Baking Soda, Aluminum-free Corn-free Baking Powder (sodium acid pyrophosphate baking soda, tapioca starch monocalcium phosphate), Xanthan Gum, Salt, Natural Flavoring.

review/text: I have spent a lot of time energy and ingredients perfecting a gluten free, sugar free, dairy free birthday cake that really taste good and has a good texture.  This is better and way easier.  Box has directions for making dairy free buttermilk (I use coconut milk with apple cider vinegar) and I use a combo of stevia and agave for sweetener but you can choose what works for you.  I don't usually do mail order for food but this one is worth it.<br /><br />Not particularly healthy but Pillsubry makes a vanilla pre made icing that is sugar/gluten/dairy free.  Together with this cake you actually have a bday cake the other kids will like.

review/text: We have purchased Westbrae Organic Cut Green Beans in the past and they are very good. We, recently, purchased two cases from Amazon for over $50.00, and that was a total waste of money. We found out, after purchasing them, that even if they are damaged they are not returnable.<br /><br />This is a first for us, as we purchase items several times a week from Amazon and have never had a problem before. We will be VERY cautious about purchasing ANY food items from them again.<br /><br />The cases were dry and bubble wrapped nicely, however, the cans were all rusted. It appears that Westbrae might be using Amazon as a dumping zone for bad cans, so buyer beware.
